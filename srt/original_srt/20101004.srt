1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,220
Speaker 0: It's Monday, October 4th, I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights!

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,619
Speaker 0: Tonight, the mysterious Electron.

3
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:18,566
Speaker 0: Ooooh!

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,058
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,840
Speaker 1: You know, it might be lame to complain about the weather, but today was perhaps the shittiest day in the history of days.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, my co-worker, the other Scott, he was like all happy with this weather.

7
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:37,817
Speaker 1: I was like, "Fuck

8
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:37,958
Speaker 1: you!"

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,320
Speaker 1: But you wanted to be cold and shitty.

10
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:45,099
Speaker 0: I was like, "Look, we were walking down the street on the sidewalk towards the burger

11
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:45,360
Speaker 0: truck.".

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,064
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Look at that!

13
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:48,135
Speaker 0: There's that bike rack, usually loaded with bikes.

14
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:48,718
Speaker 0: One

15
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:49,000
Speaker 0: bike.".

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,788
Speaker 0: I'm like, "You see that?

17
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:50,535
Speaker 0: That's

18
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:50,879
Speaker 0: bullshit.".

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,091
Speaker 1: Kinda rainy, but not actually raining.

20
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:54,800
Speaker 1: Kinda cold, but not snowing.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,620
Speaker 0: It was like, so bad.

22
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:59,520
Speaker 1: I feel like an old man to complain about the weather, but shit woman.

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,011
Speaker 0: Woman is coming soon.

24
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:01,979
Speaker 0: It's almost woman time.

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,108
Speaker 1: See, if woman were here, I could go skiing.

26
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:05,393
Speaker 1: It's not proper woman.

27
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:07,060
Speaker 1: This is just like some bitch hanging out.

28
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:09,578
Speaker 0: Some little girls.

29
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:12,440
Speaker 0: How much for your little girl?

30
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,670
Speaker 1: But at least we got some South Park coming up.

31
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:18,420
Speaker 1: We got some Monster Madness.

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,979
Speaker 0: Oh, Monster Madness, yeah.

33
00:01:20,962 --> 00:01:23,432
Speaker 0: It's good times for media consumption.

34
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:24,556
Speaker 0: Video games are coming.

35
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:25,540
Speaker 0: Holidays are coming.

36
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,123
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

37
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:26,790
Speaker 1: video games are coming?

38
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,839
Speaker 1: Civ V already came out.

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,300
Speaker 0: There's more video games coming.

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,920
Speaker 1: No, there aren't.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,357
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are.

42
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's the patch for Civ V. It'll make multiplayer work.

43
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:36,199
Speaker 0: It really doesn't work that well at all.

44
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:37,980
Speaker 0: No, but there's more games coming.

45
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,085
Speaker 1: That was so sad.

46
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:41,240
Speaker 1: It was like Russian roulette trying to get that game going.

47
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,242
Speaker 0: I know, right?

48
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:46,220
Speaker 0: But anyway, a couple weeks ago, I haven't talked about this yet because we didn't do a Monday show.

49
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,055
Speaker 0: I went to the Maker Faire in New York City.

50
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:48,599
Speaker 0: You did not go.

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,323
Speaker 0: No, I did not.

52
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:50,452
Speaker 1: Luke Burrage also went.

53
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:51,460
Speaker 1: Your mom went.

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, my mom did go, literally.

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,400
Speaker 0: You know, there was basically like, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect because this is like a California event.

56
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,111
Speaker 0: I was like, what's it going to be like in New York City?

57
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:02,460
Speaker 0: Are they going to get all these people to show up?

58
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:04,992
Speaker 0: You know, are they really going to make the trip like Pax does?

59
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,439
Speaker 0: I mean, I wasn't too sure about it.

60
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:10,054
Speaker 0: But actually, it was way more awesome than I expected, right?

61
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:11,480
Speaker 0: I'm not going to go deep on it.

62
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,025
Speaker 0: But basically, you go in.

63
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:17,800
Speaker 0: It was at the New York Hall of Science in Queens, which I had been to when I was very young with my grandmother.

64
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,200
Speaker 1: It's over by where the World's Fair was back in the day.

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,104
Speaker 1: Yeah.

66
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:23,740
Speaker 0: So, first of all, right, that museum has not changed.

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,938
Speaker 0: There were things, exhibits in that museum that I remember that are unchanged in at least 20 years.

68
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:28,962
Speaker 0: Right.

69
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,451
Speaker 0: There's a hall of mirrors and there's one of those things.

70
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:34,100
Speaker 0: you stand in front of it and it leaves colors behind you.

71
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:38,478
Speaker 0: All these same exact science exhibits are still there after all these years unchanged.

72
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:38,900
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

73
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:43,220
Speaker 0: Anyway, as for the Maker Faire, right, it had all sorts of stuff going on.

74
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,089
Speaker 0: First of all, there's a craft fair, totally awesome craft fair.

75
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:49,640
Speaker 0: I bought an awesome T-shirt that had robots and castles and knights on it.

76
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,900
Speaker 1: It's a good shirt, I will admit.

77
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:51,867
Speaker 0: All right.

78
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:52,939
Speaker 0: The guy had other good shirts, too.

79
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:59,037
Speaker 0: But there was all sorts of yarn and basically there were all sorts of stations where you could learn to knit and or solder, soldering.

80
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:03,980
Speaker 1: I feel like knitting is really for nerds on the upswing.

81
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,643
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

82
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:06,160
Speaker 0: It's big time, way big time.

83
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:13,360
Speaker 0: There was some corporate promotion stuff like Ford had a thing and Martha Stewart Living was there, but those didn't really get that much attention.

84
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,859
Speaker 0: Most of the attention was on the home brewed stuffs.

85
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:19,644
Speaker 0: The MakerBot guys were there.

86
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:27,340
Speaker 0: There were some other people who were professionals that had a multi-thousand dollar machine that did the same thing as the MakerBot, only better.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,019
Speaker 0: But it was much bigger for companies, not for regular people.

88
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,180
Speaker 0: All sorts of like hundreds of tables of people who just had some project they made and they were showing it off.

89
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:48,840
Speaker 0: One guy had this wooden box that had various different things on it, like a piece of wood and a piece of metal and a bell.

90
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,460
Speaker 0: It basically had these solenoids that would bounce up and hit these various things and it made music.

91
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,725
Speaker 0: A lot of different musical things.

92
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:59,460
Speaker 0: It was in fact like a room of music inside the Science Center.

93
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,639
Speaker 0: People from the Tesla Museum out in Long Island had a little area in there.

94
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:14,200
Speaker 0: Basically all outside and all inside the museum there were just tables in every empty space with somebody who was showing off the thing that they made.

95
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,266
Speaker 0: Whether it was electronic or what not.

96
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:22,640
Speaker 0: I don't think I've ever seen this many Arduinos in one small space in my entire life.

97
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,880
Speaker 0: There was also chariot races, which I think we should totally do because we could totally beat all of those guys.

98
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:30,063
Speaker 1: I was amazed.

99
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,186
Speaker 1: You said there was a chariot race.

100
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:31,887
Speaker 1: You sent me the link.

101
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,494
Speaker 1: Those are some shitty chintzy chariots.

102
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,020
Speaker 1: I made better soapbox derby cars when I was a kid.

103
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:39,548
Speaker 0: There were many heats in the chariot races.

104
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:41,775
Speaker 0: That was the particular heat that I saw live.

105
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:43,100
Speaker 0: There was a great crash.

106
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,998
Speaker 0: And everyone's chariot broke except for the human powered British invasion.

107
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,100
Speaker 1: Were there some rules we don't know about like you can't make it good?

108
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,059
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

109
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,119
Speaker 1: Because a lot of those, much like when they have those...

110
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,939
Speaker 0: I don't know if there's a rule, but I think making it good is against the spirit of the chariot race.

111
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,520
Speaker 1: Kind of like how there's a lot of those flying machine contests where you try to make the most absurd thing possible.

112
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:08,040
Speaker 1: Or like the bed races that happen at a lot of local fairs where you put a bed on rollers and race it down the street.

113
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,460
Speaker 1: I feel like, however, if it is against the spirit, we should be team evil.

114
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,645
Speaker 0: We should be evil team.

115
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,159
Speaker 0: We could dress up as the evil team, the whole thing.

116
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,026
Speaker 0: Anyway, the chariot races were cool.

117
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:24,380
Speaker 0: The guys who did the Coke and Mentos were there, but I didn't watch their shtick because I've seen it on the internet.

118
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,257
Speaker 0: It was a life-sized mousetrap, which is pretty impressive.

119
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:30,240
Speaker 0: You can see that on the internet.

120
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,700
Speaker 1: Supposedly the last time they ran it, instead of dropping a cage on the mice, they dropped a safe on a car.

121
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, they did.

122
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:38,733
Speaker 0: They dropped a safe on a car.

123
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:39,459
Speaker 0: I watched that.

124
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,194
Speaker 1: That seems at least a little wasteful.

125
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:42,799
Speaker 1: I'll give them that.

126
00:05:43,963 --> 00:05:46,220
Speaker 0: It was an old shitty car that was all busted.

127
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,498
Speaker 1: What about the safe?

128
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,724
Speaker 0: The safe?

129
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:50,519
Speaker 0: Because they kept you reusing the safe.

130
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:56,760
Speaker 0: But, you know, there was all sorts of other cool stuff going on there.

131
00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:59,795
Speaker 0: The one thing that they were lacking was food vendors.

132
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:00,700
Speaker 0: There were only a few.

133
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,680
Speaker 0: So even the shitty hot dog stand had a huge line, and the burger truck that was there, which is one I'd never seen before, had a hugest line.

134
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,933
Speaker 0: Someone should have driven up there with their fucking food vending truck.

135
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,279
Speaker 0: They would have made mad bank, yo.

136
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,700
Speaker 1: Of course, if you'd walked out and go to the street, like right at the edge of the park, there's a ton of shitty restaurants right there.

137
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

138
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,340
Speaker 1: If you want some really bad lunch food, there's food there.

139
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:21,901
Speaker 0: There was.

140
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:27,240
Speaker 0: No, but Maker Faire, totally worth spending a day at and checking out everything that was going on.

141
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,227
Speaker 0: Even non-nerdy people would have fun there.

142
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:31,637
Speaker 0: In fact, non-nerdy people would have more fun because you would not be so...

143
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,780
Speaker 1: I feel like kids, nerdy kids between the ages of 8 and 18.

144
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,164
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, there were so many kid activities.

145
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:44,260
Speaker 0: They had multiple stations where you could learn shit if you were a kid and do kid crafts and kid activities.

146
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:49,800
Speaker 0: There were different labs you could go to, so it was definitely all about kids going on there.

147
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,840
Speaker 1: So I got a really old news, but I bring it up only because it's so old, and therefore slightly more relevant now.

148
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:00,600
Speaker 1: This is from about a year ago.

149
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:02,279
Speaker 0: It's not really news then at all.

150
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:05,640
Speaker 1: And it was a project at MIT called Project Gaydar.

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:16,340
Speaker 1: And this may remind you, remember at RIT we found that thing online where you submit a small sample of text, and with a surprising degree of accuracy it would say if a man or woman wrote that text.

152
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,539
Speaker 1: Well, this is that for if you're gay or not.

153
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:20,737
Speaker 0: Oh, a text?

154
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:23,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, it actually was a little more advanced than that.

155
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:32,020
Speaker 1: The idea on this is to analyze all the information about someone on social networks, and then figure out their sexuality based on that.

156
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:41,679
Speaker 0: Actually, I remember something, I thought this is what it was going to be about, but I guess not, is that they could tell people's sexualities with a high degree of accuracy based on the gait of their walk.

157
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:49,240
Speaker 1: The gait of the walk and also a factor is the length of difference between the index finger and the middle finger.

158
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,920
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but I mean the thing is I thought that the Gaydar would actually just sort of use multiple webcams.

159
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:56,160
Speaker 1: Well, then it would be the Gaydar.

160
00:07:57,382 --> 00:08:03,400
Speaker 0: And look at everyone in the vicinity and then provide some sort of heads-up display.

161
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,560
Speaker 1: But see, that's not so useful if you're trying to figure out people on the internet.

162
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,657
Speaker 0: That's true, but you want to figure out people when you're walking around town like, "Oh,

163
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:11,099
Speaker 0: homo.".

164
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
Speaker 1: Do you really need that?

165
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,620
Speaker 0: No, but it would just be hilarious, especially because it's basically you don't treat it as something serious.

166
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:18,840
Speaker 1: I have a nerd detector.

167
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,340
Speaker 0: It's like one of those fart detectors, right, where it's like you hold it near someone's button, you push the button and it goes beep, beep, beep.

168
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:25,974
Speaker 1: It's like, "I know who farted, it was

169
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:26,337
Speaker 1: Rym.".

170
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:27,499
Speaker 1: And this is real.

171
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,940
Speaker 0: I know, but maybe if you had a real fart detector, how awesome would that be?

172
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:38,020
Speaker 1: The reason I bring it up is that I've had numerous arguments with people lately about privacy and the internet and anonymity.

173
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:47,560
Speaker 1: And while Anonymous is still being very anonymous and doing its anonymous thing, I think they attacked the European equivalent of the RIAA or something like that.

174
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:51,640
Speaker 1: And it's funny that Anonymous attacks don't even gather press anymore.

175
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:57,500
Speaker 1: But people always try to make this argument that you can somehow protect your privacy.

176
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:13,800
Speaker 1: And I guess I bring this up for anyone who's having similar arguments recently, that it'll probably within the next few years, because this is an old article, be trivial to figure out way tons of information about someone, even if that person doesn't have a Facebook account or anything.

177
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:19,340
Speaker 1: Because mentions of them by their friends alone will likely be enough to figure out who they are, where they live, their sexuality.

178
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:28,940
Speaker 0: The only way to be private is to don't say anything and don't be friends with anybody and don't go outside.

179
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,900
Speaker 0: And then nobody will know anything about you.

180
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:35,519
Speaker 0: If you just walk out of your house in the morning, on your way to your car, people can see you.

181
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,359
Speaker 0: And if people can see you, they can take your picture and they know your address.

182
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:46,980
Speaker 0: And they can take your picture and they know your address, they can know your name, and then they can know pretty much everything about you just based on looking at you, looking at your car, looking at your license plate.

183
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:48,000
Speaker 1: They record a physical thing.

184
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:57,980
Speaker 1: I think a much more, I guess, scary to many people hack is the fact that statistical analysis will probably be able to figure out based on, all right, this post was made by this person.

185
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:03,280
Speaker 1: This post was made anonymously on an unrelated site, but was very likely to have been written by the same person.

186
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:06,299
Speaker 1: And this third post has a name and now we know exactly who it is.

187
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:14,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it takes so little information to extrapolate a very large amount of information because it's all so associated already.

188
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:15,938
Speaker 0: There's no point in fighting it.

189
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:25,219
Speaker 0: Instead of trying to eliminate this situation, which is impossible, in my opinion, you should instead learn to live with it instead of trying to return to an ancient time.

190
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:40,280
Speaker 1: I had a revelation, I was reading this and I was thinking about another argument I have had where if you have ubiquitous internet that is effectively untraceable, then organizations like the so-called anonymous could be a lot more powerful.

191
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,700
Speaker 1: They could exert real influence if they were organized in a non-directed way.

192
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:52,900
Speaker 1: But at the same time, analysis like this makes something like anonymous impossible because if they post more than a couple of times, you figure out who they are and now they're fucked.

193
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got GPS data, you got so much fucking data.

194
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:59,240
Speaker 1: But I realized a way to maintain anonymity and think about this.

195
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,260
Speaker 1: Right now, the problem would be, alright, I post on 4chan and I get people to do stuff and I'm part of this thing.

196
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,400
Speaker 1: But then statistical analysis of the way I write eventually based on the volume of my post figures out who I am based on other things I've written in my life.

197
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:25,740
Speaker 1: If your posts in the manner of 4chan or whatever are, like if your persona is indistinguishable from anyone else on 4chan, like if you can have an alter ego.

198
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,279
Speaker 0: The only post you ever post is first.

199
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean sure, I can say alright, we know to a reasonable degree that one of these 40,000 people is that first post guy.

200
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:39,200
Speaker 1: And then you have safety in the crowds again.

201
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:52,420
Speaker 1: So, coming back to the more practical thing like this, if you're not trying to be some sort of internet future 4chan terrorist, safety in the crowds is the safest way to protect yourself from the fact that you cannot have privacy in the modern world.

202
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:58,460
Speaker 0: The thing is, okay, so I'm gonna seek safety in the crowd on 4chan by basically saying the same kinds of things everyone else is saying.

203
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,440
Speaker 0: Well, what that means is- What's the point of even saying anything if I'm just saying what everyone else is saying?

204
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:17,439
Speaker 1: No, what it means is that 4chan, or Anonymous at least, would evolve over time such that the large number of people who are posting in it basically have the exact same personality and desires, at least in the context of Anonymous and 4chan.

205
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,728
Speaker 1: So, it's kind of like gods in Dungeons and Dragons.

206
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:26,630
Speaker 1: Remember how the gods in D&D are basically people who are like-minded, they all kind of merge together into one thing.

207
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,340
Speaker 1: that does what all of them individually would have done?

208
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,644
Speaker 0: Mmm, okay.

209
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:33,920
Speaker 1: Well, that was at least implied heavily in the re-release of Planescape.

210
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,925
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

211
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:40,500
Speaker 0: I'm probably the only one who didn't own those stupid boxes or read those books, unlike all you nerds.

212
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:49,060
Speaker 0: So anyway, I got a news that's related to what I was just discussing about the Maker Faire, and that is at the Maker Faire, they launched a new Arduino, right?

213
00:12:50,401 --> 00:13:08,360
Speaker 0: If you don't know already, the Arduino is basically this little tiny computer that has a USB port and a power connector and a bunch of digital and analog inputs and outputs to make it very easy to create electronic projects of varying shapes and sizes, you know, if you're a total nub.

214
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,620
Speaker 0: You know, you can't make like a DVD player with it, but you can make all sorts of stuff involving LEDs and sound and all sorts of stuff.

215
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,320
Speaker 1: You could probably control a DVD player with it.

216
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,663
Speaker 1: Maybe.

217
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, remote control, totally.

218
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:23,960
Speaker 0: And it's, you know, you can get all sorts of attachments for it and there's all sorts of companies making stuff for it.

219
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,610
Speaker 0: So they came out with a new one.

220
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,220
Speaker 0: It's very similar to the previous one.

221
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:33,020
Speaker 0: It's basically a slight upgrade in the memory and that sort of thing with, I think, a smaller firmware and some other stuff like that.

222
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:36,060
Speaker 0: But the biggest thing they changed was the marketing on it, right?

223
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:42,780
Speaker 0: It's now they have like cool graphic design, like it's the Arduino Uno and the Arduino, I forget, Duo, I think is the other one.

224
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:51,000
Speaker 1: Because I recall back in the day, remember all those like box you could buy at Radio Shack that had a bunch of resistors and a breadboard and had projects and taught you about this stuff?

225
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:56,557
Speaker 1: Those things had very awesome like lasers, check out the awesome stuff kids can do with this thing.

226
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:57,680
Speaker 1: Holy crap!

227
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:01,200
Speaker 0: No, no, there's a Uno, a Nano.

228
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,052
Speaker 1: So who is this graphic design marketed at?

229
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,199
Speaker 1: Like what kind of...

230
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,819
Speaker 0: I don't know, look, it's like a cool, it's like an infinity sign with a plus and a minus in it.

231
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,899
Speaker 0: It's, you know, they got a new marketing shit going on.

232
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:15,879
Speaker 0: So I think it's going to work out for them pretty well here.

233
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:21,340
Speaker 0: As opposed to, like the previous marketing was pretty much like, it looked really nerdy.

234
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,099
Speaker 0: Now it looks like a friendly, fun thing to do.

235
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,560
Speaker 1: The thing is, as we're probably going to get into in the second half of the show tonight at least, I don't think it's still that friendly to most people.

236
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,440
Speaker 0: It's surprisingly friendly, it's actually being used by tons of artists more so than programmer types.

237
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,460
Speaker 0: Because programming people and nerds, they just have a computer, a real computer, and they program that.

238
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,740
Speaker 0: But Arduino is good for people making like, I just want to put lights on this thing.

239
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:49,940
Speaker 0: And it's really hard for them to, you know, control lights on it or make Halloween decorations do stuff.

240
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,980
Speaker 0: You know, it's hard to do that with a computer that you buy like on a Mac or anything like that.

241
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,400
Speaker 1: But it's really easy to do with a stepper motor and a couple of gears.

242
00:14:57,662 --> 00:14:58,579
Speaker 0: Yes, very easy.

243
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,900
Speaker 1: But then you don't need the Arduino.

244
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,980
Speaker 0: Actually no, the Arduino makes it easy to program the motor and the gears into a routine.

245
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:10,140
Speaker 1: It is surprisingly easy to make a simple routine happen with just a stepper motor and some gears.

246
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:16,820
Speaker 0: I'm talking about stuff like, you know, the guy who's got like a Halloween thing where his house like lights up in sync with the music, you know, that kind of shit.

247
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,020
Speaker 1: That's tough, but if you want like a skeleton face that pops out every 30 seconds, you don't need an Arduino to do that.

248
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,460
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, but you know, this is, we're talking about real...

249
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,060
Speaker 1: You need your little brother tied up in a box.

250
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,359
Speaker 0: We're talking about real business here.

251
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:37,411
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

252
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,460
Speaker 1: I'm gonna keep saying it differently every day.

253
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:40,862
Speaker 0: Whatever.

254
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:44,100
Speaker 0: So I saw this video on the internets and I see a lot of videos on the internets.

255
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,715
Speaker 1: Ah, you do.

256
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,180
Speaker 1: I see a lot of videos on the Internet.

257
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,780
Speaker 0: I see maybe more videos on the Internet than there are drugs being sold in this community.

258
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,560
Speaker 1: But Black Dynamite.

259
00:15:55,081 --> 00:16:00,300
Speaker 0: Anyway, this video is like one of the best videos I've seen on the Internet in a long time.

260
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,606
Speaker 0: At least that I can remember.

261
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,499
Speaker 0: Like, you know, you know how I can tell that is even though...

262
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:05,500
Speaker 1: By the pixels.

263
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,843
Speaker 0: Well, no, I can tell.

264
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:12,860
Speaker 0: I can tell because of, you know, remembering it's like, can I remember anything that was better than this?

265
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:15,818
Speaker 0: And not really, because if it was so much better, I would have remembered it.

266
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:16,060
Speaker 0: Right.

267
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,659
Speaker 0: So and this I'm definitely not going to forget this.

268
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:24,940
Speaker 0: So what this is is a supposed homeless man or a guy pretending to be a homeless man.

269
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,644
Speaker 0: It's hard to tell.

270
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:27,960
Speaker 0: And it doesn't really matter whether he is or isn't.

271
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,339
Speaker 0: But what he does in this video is he has two Kermit the Frogs.

272
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,900
Speaker 0: I don't know if they are like, you know, I don't know if they don't have like control of the arms and legs.

273
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,648
Speaker 0: It's just a put your hand in it kind of Kermit.

274
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:39,557
Speaker 0: But it's still a pretty high quality Kermit the Frogs.

275
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:44,100
Speaker 0: He's got two of them and he's sitting out in front of a building with his homeless chair and his homeless son.

276
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:47,909
Speaker 0: And he's got the song Under Pressure on a box.

277
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,160
Speaker 0: But apparently whoever did this video, you know, redubbed the song over it.

278
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,957
Speaker 1: So kids, that's the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo song.

279
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:57,820
Speaker 1: in case you didn't know.

280
00:16:58,264 --> 00:16:59,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, hopefully they know.

281
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,070
Speaker 1: I don't think kids know anymore.

282
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,060
Speaker 1: They might know it has been a lie.

283
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,504
Speaker 0: If you don't know this song, just kill yourself.

284
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:08,200
Speaker 0: Anyway, and basically in his left hand, which is your right, is Kermit Mercury.

285
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,477
Speaker 0: And in his right hand, which is your left, is Kermit Bowie.

286
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:13,180
Speaker 0: Right.

287
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,656
Speaker 0: And he proceeds to have, you know, Kermit Mercury and Kermit Bowie rock the house.

288
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,487
Speaker 0: And this video is just so awesome.

289
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:24,359
Speaker 0: And if it actually is a homeless dude, it's double awesome.

290
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,730
Speaker 0: But even if it's not, it doesn't matter.

291
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,999
Speaker 0: It's still like the greatest.

292
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,120
Speaker 1: He really gets points for how into it he gets.

293
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:35,599
Speaker 1: One of the comments Kermit's like hanging off of his neck, singing at you.

294
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:39,198
Speaker 0: One of the comments was like, where is it?

295
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:44,379
Speaker 0: It's like he put all he had into that one.

296
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:52,900
Speaker 1: Well, it also speaks very highly of the power of Muppets because these are like the lowest grade of Muppet.

297
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,418
Speaker 1: They're basically just a hand puppet shaped like a Muppet.

298
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:55,640
Speaker 1: Right.

299
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,580
Speaker 1: He is able to put so much perceived emotion into something where all he can do is waggle it, open and close the mouth.

300
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:04,009
Speaker 1: That's all he's got.

301
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,419
Speaker 1: Waggle, open, close.

302
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,041
Speaker 1: Yep.

303
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:08,116
Speaker 1: And I'm feeling Freddy by the end of this.

304
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:08,700
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

305
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:12,499
Speaker 0: So, yeah, this is an excellent, excellent Internet right here.

306
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,740
Speaker 1: So the meta moment, nice and quick.

307
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:18,680
Speaker 1: The book club book that we just finished was Ray Breiberger's Golden Apples of the Sun.

308
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,480
Speaker 1: The next book club book is World War Z by Max Brooks.

309
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,244
Speaker 0: We'll see.

310
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:24,810
Speaker 0: Zombies.

311
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:25,699
Speaker 1: We'll see.

312
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Speaker 0: It's weird because it's like, it's zombies.

313
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,498
Speaker 0: The guy also wrote the zombie survival guide.

314
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:30,720
Speaker 0: Right.

315
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:35,940
Speaker 0: The expectations based on that information is that this book is going to be just a shallow zombie book.

316
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,840
Speaker 0: But at the same time, people are saying good things.

317
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:41,620
Speaker 0: But those could be shallow people.

318
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:42,960
Speaker 0: It is tough to say.

319
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,279
Speaker 0: But regardless, I picked this book because I believe that people will read it.

320
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:48,960
Speaker 0: And after this, I'm going to go back to picking good books.

321
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,580
Speaker 1: See, I worry the people who are saying they like it and they want us to read it are the same people who want us to do a goddamn zombie survival guide again.

322
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:57,149
Speaker 0: Yeah.

323
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,920
Speaker 1: We've done what, like three or four of those things?

324
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:05,298
Speaker 0: If you really want one, go read Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z by Max Brooks.

325
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:05,760
Speaker 0: Read a book.

326
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:06,580
Speaker 1: Max Brooks?

327
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,880
Speaker 0: I mean, even reading Brooks, reading and even reading a zombie book is reading a book.

328
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,335
Speaker 0: It's not a sports page and it's not a magazine.

329
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:14,999
Speaker 0: So read it.

330
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:16,508
Speaker 0: It's all good.

331
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:17,940
Speaker 0: It's better than reading nothing.

332
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:24,040
Speaker 1: So this weekend we will be at the Combined Double New York Comic Con New York Anime Festival.

333
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:32,239
Speaker 0: I'm probably only going to be there Friday because Saturday and Sunday I'm going to go to 1010 the Burning Wheel convention, which I think is full now.

334
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,283
Speaker 1: Yeah.

335
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:33,959
Speaker 1: So you can't go.

336
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:34,846
Speaker 0: Sorry.

337
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:35,700
Speaker 0: Unless you're going already.

338
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:37,334
Speaker 1: Yeah.

339
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:37,799
Speaker 1: That's it.

340
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,401
Speaker 0: Yeah.

341
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:40,779
Speaker 0: Anything that happens after that, we'll let you know.

342
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,799
Speaker 1: Kineticon panel submissions will be opening within a month or so.

343
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:46,699
Speaker 1: And we're going to be at PAX East doing at least two panels.

344
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,100
Speaker 0: We'll probably be at Anime Boston.

345
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,204
Speaker 1: Possibly three.

346
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:52,680
Speaker 1: We will likely be at Anime Boston, but we have not determined what we're doing there yet.

347
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:57,880
Speaker 0: No, you know, just and we will very we will very, very likely be at MAGFAST.

348
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,156
Speaker 0: There's no way that I'm going to miss MAGFAST.

349
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:03,468
Speaker 0: Anyway.

350
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:04,338
Speaker 0: All right.

351
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:09,140
Speaker 0: So, you know, in light of all this Maker Faire Arduino kind of stuff.

352
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:09,681
Speaker 0: Right.

353
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:15,680
Speaker 0: You know, I wanted to do some sort of show on electronics, but I am not an electronics expert.

354
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,520
Speaker 0: I mean, I know more than the average person on the street.

355
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:22,200
Speaker 0: But my PVs, my NRTs and all that.

356
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,100
Speaker 1: I have not actually soldered anything to anything.

357
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,523
Speaker 0: I know.

358
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,260
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, that's not even the right.

359
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,939
Speaker 0: That's like the ideal gas laws.

360
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,740
Speaker 0: And it shows it's like, you know, vehicles are or whatever.

361
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,480
Speaker 1: The last time I wielded a soldering iron for purposes of soldering was more than three years ago.

362
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:42,841
Speaker 0: Yeah.

363
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:50,320
Speaker 0: I mean, I've actually got some soldering skills now because I've been putting together some kits, but I'm not capable of like designing my own thing.

364
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,500
Speaker 0: I can just follow the instructions and I have crafting skills.

365
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Speaker 0: So to solder something, you just put something together.

366
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,450
Speaker 0: It's like Legos.

367
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:57,000
Speaker 0: I can do that.

368
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,780
Speaker 1: I haven't built a Rube Goldberg machine or anything in at least a decade.

369
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:03,960
Speaker 1: And the last project I had that was anyway electronic was when I built a hard DDR pad.

370
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,500
Speaker 1: And that was what that project alone.

371
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,019
Speaker 1: I harken back to and I realized why we need to do this show.

372
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:16,859
Speaker 1: It's not so much we can sit here and talk all day about like when to use transistors and why they're cool and like how to make cool stuff.

373
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,900
Speaker 1: But really, I think people just aren't curious or interested in electronics.

374
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:25,160
Speaker 1: And I think that is actually going to really prevent people from doing really awesome stuff.

375
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:26,179
Speaker 0: I think so also.

376
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:35,480
Speaker 0: And, you know, the thing is, is it's one thing to, you know, when you have electronic stuff that's already put together, like your laptop and your computer and your TV and your DVD player.

377
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:35,821
Speaker 0: Right.

378
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:37,739
Speaker 0: People are really good at using electronic things.

379
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:44,935
Speaker 0: But because these things are just built in factories and mass produced, no one ever actually has to know, you know, how what a resistor is these days.

380
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,340
Speaker 0: You don't need to know that at all.

381
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:47,881
Speaker 0: Right.

382
00:21:47,962 --> 00:21:49,980
Speaker 0: And you can still totally do all this crazy stuff.

383
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,880
Speaker 0: And because you can we have software.

384
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:52,761
Speaker 0: Right.

385
00:21:52,982 --> 00:21:58,820
Speaker 0: It's really the invention of software meant that you can now program devices without knowing a single thing about hardware.

386
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Speaker 0: Remember, computers work on electricity.

387
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:04,040
Speaker 0: That is the thing that makes a computer go is electricity.

388
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:11,900
Speaker 0: And most people using a computer, they can program ridiculous shit and harness like the power of God over those electrons.

389
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:12,522
Speaker 0: Right.

390
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:16,880
Speaker 0: Without even knowing a single thing about the laws of physics and only knowing math.

391
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:17,902
Speaker 0: Right.

392
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:23,240
Speaker 0: Because we have extra somehow magically abstracted that completely away from necessary knowledge.

393
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,320
Speaker 1: Of course, most of those people end up trying to make a game and then that game will involve some sort of physics.

394
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,699
Speaker 1: And then they have to learn physics to make their game work.

395
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:31,927
Speaker 0: OK, maybe.

396
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:32,349
Speaker 0: But they don't.

397
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,060
Speaker 0: usually they don't need to know electricity physics.

398
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:36,340
Speaker 0: They just need to know, like kinematic physics.

399
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,782
Speaker 0: Yeah.

400
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:40,000
Speaker 0: And, you know, those are laws of motion and maybe thermodynamics.

401
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,500
Speaker 1: But at the same time, people who go that route, that's well and good.

402
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,460
Speaker 1: But as a kid, I was building very complex burglar alarms for my bedroom because I was bored.

403
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:58,580
Speaker 0: I actually you know, I never was really interested in electronics until I went to summer camp where I took electronics, you know, as nerd summer camp.

404
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,680
Speaker 0: So I chose electronics as one of my elected science things.

405
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:04,759
Speaker 0: And that is where I learned to solder from the Australian guy.

406
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:06,820
Speaker 0: And I made, of course, a burglar alarm.

407
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:09,060
Speaker 1: That seems to be the first thing kids make.

408
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,020
Speaker 0: It was actually pretty cool because, you know, I actually learned to make a circuit board.

409
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,261
Speaker 0: Right.

410
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:17,220
Speaker 0: They gave you this piece of, you know, a piece of material with copper on one side.

411
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,819
Speaker 0: You took a Sharpie and you drew your circuit on the Sharpie and put a circle where the holes are supposed to be.

412
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:24,272
Speaker 0: And you drilled the holes.

413
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:25,000
Speaker 0: Right.

414
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:29,660
Speaker 0: And then they would dip the thing in acid for you overnight because they didn't let you play with the acid.

415
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:33,820
Speaker 0: And then they would take it out and you would get, you know, you'd see, oh, my God, that's how it's done.

416
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,403
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

417
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:37,279
Speaker 0: And it was like it was like a total revelation for me.

418
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:38,880
Speaker 1: See, I didn't use.

419
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,058
Speaker 0: And I also learned that Sharpie blocks acid.

420
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:41,560
Speaker 1: Yeah.

421
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:50,240
Speaker 1: For a lot of the things that I was doing, what I ended up having to use were not so much circuit boards, but it'd be like for a big Rube Goldberg machine or something like Science Olympiad in middle school.

422
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:55,540
Speaker 1: So I'd have to like wire up a power bus and then control solenoids and things.

423
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,984
Speaker 1: I'd put like one.

424
00:23:57,065 --> 00:24:01,460
Speaker 1: I'd basically wire together these logic circuits that were just wires connected to each other.

425
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:01,901
Speaker 0: Yeah.

426
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:04,460
Speaker 0: I mean, the other thing is this is something I still have problem with.

427
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:04,741
Speaker 0: Right.

428
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:11,500
Speaker 0: As I know, basically what a lot or the vast majority of the electronic, the basic fundamental electronic components do.

429
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:11,862
Speaker 0: Right.

430
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:14,940
Speaker 0: I know that a capacitor stores and or releases a charge.

431
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:16,340
Speaker 0: You know, I know that a resistor resists.

432
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:23,100
Speaker 0: Well, I think that's why, you know, I know that that, you know, a depends on what you want to do at that point.

433
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,415
Speaker 1: What's important is there are two paths where minimal knowledge in either will greatly expand your hobbying abilities, because the path I went down with.

434
00:24:30,515 --> 00:24:31,277
Speaker 1: one path is the.

435
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:32,700
Speaker 1: I want to program circuits.

436
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,944
Speaker 1: I want to do complex things.

437
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:37,720
Speaker 1: That's when you have to know, like what an oscillator is and how to make a simple one.

438
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:38,222
Speaker 1: Yeah.

439
00:24:38,262 --> 00:24:41,000
Speaker 1: How to make like an adder and a subtractor out of just, you know.

440
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,449
Speaker 0: Well, that's getting into computing, right?

441
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:44,180
Speaker 0: You don't even need to do that sort of computing.

442
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,260
Speaker 0: You don't really need gates, you know, unless you're doing, you know, a logic stuff.

443
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,620
Speaker 0: And usually most people don't, at least in modern times, if you're like the Arduino.

444
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:53,062
Speaker 0: Right.

445
00:24:53,082 --> 00:24:57,000
Speaker 0: It doesn't really have any logic parts on it because you don't need to know about those.

446
00:24:57,281 --> 00:25:03,420
Speaker 0: You just buy a chip, you know, a microprocessor, and then all your logic is inside of that and you write software for it.

447
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:07,900
Speaker 0: And the only electronics you actually need to know is the, you know, the input and the output electronics.

448
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,940
Speaker 0: You need to know how to hook up like a temperature sensor to the analog input, you know, properly.

449
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,419
Speaker 0: You need to know how to hook up an LED to the digital output.

450
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:26,760
Speaker 1: The Arduino has opened up kind of a third path because that path, before there were things like Arduino, that path of doing, of implementing fairly simple logic on your own kind of unlocked all sorts of crazy things you could do.

451
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:36,500
Speaker 1: Like it was really easy to take a serial port and have it interact with a physical thing, even without an Arduino back in the day, as long as you could, like you could figure out the basics of logic circuitry.

452
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,100
Speaker 0: Yeah.

453
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:42,506
Speaker 0: And you know, before they had a microprocessor that you could just buy, you had to make your own logic circuitry and there would be switches.

454
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:44,600
Speaker 0: Like a pinball machine is a good example, right?

455
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:50,360
Speaker 0: It's a, you know, it's an electronic device and everything is done with relays and switches, you know.

456
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,071
Speaker 0: And, you know, there's no, all the memory is just relays.

457
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:56,960
Speaker 0: There's no microprocessor in an old pinball machine.

458
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, but think about the crazy things you can do if you understand logic and you have basic skills.

459
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,480
Speaker 1: Like say you're a kid, you're in Science Olympiad, which is always a common thing.

460
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,600
Speaker 1: And there's always some sort of Rube Goldberg-like event.

461
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:18,020
Speaker 1: It may or may not, I'm not admitting to anything, have been really trivial to cheat by setting up a power distribution bus such that the entire device was actually controlled from a centralized location.

462
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,980
Speaker 1: And the Rube Goldberg aspects of it were totally staged.

463
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:23,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

464
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,879
Speaker 1: And you totally won a bunch of medals with that.

465
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,380
Speaker 0: No one noticed that there were wires going everywhere.

466
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,860
Speaker 1: Well, the first year, as an aside, they didn't have any rules against parallel processes, right?

467
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:36,880
Speaker 1: So we had the Rube Goldberg machine just set something up and then wait.

468
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,729
Speaker 1: And then at the apportioned time, we built a clock out of wood with a pendulum that ticked down exactly two minutes and then hit a button.

469
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:44,859
Speaker 1: that finished the thing and we won.

470
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:47,008
Speaker 1: Next year, they're like, "No parallel

471
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:47,511
Speaker 1: processes.".

472
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:48,880
Speaker 1: So we hid the parallel process.

473
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:51,479
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

474
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:59,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the tech I really want to focus on, at least for my enjoyment and how I've been able to do things, is the practical electronics knowledge.

475
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:13,300
Speaker 1: Not so much building circuits or Arduinos or everything, but knowing things like what constitutes a conductor, what does not conduct, how to insulate against electricity, what a stepper motor is, why you might want to use a stepper motor.

476
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:22,240
Speaker 1: Because even if you have the Arduino skills, if you want to interface with the physical world, if you don't know how to solder and do basic electronic stuff, you're fucked.

477
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,480
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, the Arduino doesn't do anything unless you know that stuff, right?

478
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:35,979
Speaker 0: Because all it is, is basically it's a microprocessor that you can load with some software that's pretty easy to write and then it has digital inputs, digital outputs, analog inputs and analog outputs and that's it.

479
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:41,640
Speaker 0: So you need to hook up those inputs and outputs to electronic things that are of your own making, right?

480
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,820
Speaker 0: Or you can get a book that gives you designs, but what's the point of just following instructions and doing a kit?

481
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:49,500
Speaker 0: You might as well just look at someone else do it.

482
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:56,720
Speaker 0: You got to actually come up with your own new thing or at least try to do something without instructions and then you're actually learning something.

483
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:17,187
Speaker 1: But I worry that kids just don't have this basic knowledge and I was about to say anymore, but there's an article on Slashdot about the mystification and demystification of electricity back in the day, like when we were rolling out electricity to America, how people kind of didn't understand it and were afraid of it and how eventually people get used to it.

484
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:30,680
Speaker 1: and the article is interesting, but it made me realize that I don't think, you know, the common argument that old mechanics will make is that back in the day a car was simple and everybody knew how to take apart an engine and put it together because there's a rubber band and like one cylinder.

485
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:36,460
Speaker 0: No, back in the day the mechanic, the stupid mechanic knew how to take apart a car and put it back together.

486
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:37,258
Speaker 0: Nobody else did.

487
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,140
Speaker 0: Now the mechanic, right, doesn't even understand the car because he's got all the stuff that he doesn't get.

488
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:44,300
Speaker 1: I'm making a much simpler argument.

489
00:28:44,741 --> 00:29:02,720
Speaker 1: My argument is that the people who decry the fact that increasing complexity and electronics and the things we have today have removed simplicity such that now the average person can't fix their own stuff, I don't think since the Industrial Revolution the majority of people in America have ever been able to fix their own stuff.

490
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:07,440
Speaker 0: I don't think in much of the world people haven't been able to fix their own stuff.

491
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,020
Speaker 1: Pioneer days, people had to fix their own stuff or die trying.

492
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:22,280
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, there are some places, right, in Cuba there is a huge culture of making these old cars work because they don't have any new cars there, you know, so there are a lot of people there who really know how to fucking make a car work.

493
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:25,100
Speaker 0: but the cars they have are old cars.

494
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:31,180
Speaker 1: Hey, hey, business idea, because Castro is going to die someday and eventually, you know, probably in our lifetime, Cuba is going to, we're going to normalize relations.

495
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:42,560
Speaker 1: If you want to make a buck, be ready to jump in as soon as it's legal, grab every goddamn mechanic in Cuba, bring them over here and make the awesome car shop for every rich person.

496
00:29:42,862 --> 00:29:43,738
Speaker 0: For every old car.

497
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,165
Speaker 1: Yeah, every old car.

498
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,840
Speaker 1: They're not going to be working on your brand new Lamborghini.

499
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,639
Speaker 0: No, it's not going to happen.

500
00:29:48,861 --> 00:29:50,220
Speaker 1: Of course, they could probably figure it out.

501
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,200
Speaker 0: Maybe, but the thing is they wouldn't figure out anything with a computer on it.

502
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:53,901
Speaker 0: Yeah,

503
00:29:54,202 --> 00:30:06,718
Speaker 1: but I feel it's like the people who complain the most about kids don't know anything today are the people who knew something when they were kids and most people don't know or care and I feel like people know about as much about electronics now as they did 80 years

504
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:06,799
Speaker 0: ago.

505
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,200
Speaker 0: I think it's also there are people who had a specialized knowledge in the past, their knowledge got outdated.

506
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:12,743
Speaker 0: Right.

507
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:15,140
Speaker 0: And they complain that something got too complicated.

508
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,580
Speaker 0: Really, it was just them not keeping up with the times.

509
00:30:17,962 --> 00:30:18,143
Speaker 0: Right.

510
00:30:18,204 --> 00:30:20,179
Speaker 0: Or them being unable to give up for the times.

511
00:30:20,782 --> 00:30:23,260
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like, you know, they don't know it anymore.

512
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:28,400
Speaker 0: I used to know I used to be an expert on cars, but now cars are too hard and I'm not an expert anymore.

513
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,898
Speaker 0: But there's some other guy who is.

514
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:33,179
Speaker 0: So it's your problem, not the problem of the car.

515
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,460
Speaker 1: Thus, I want to present to you something I like to call the melancholy of the DDR freaks hobbyist forum.

516
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:39,099
Speaker 0: All right.

517
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,120
Speaker 1: Because I wanted to make a hard DDR pad dance dance revolution.

518
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,704
Speaker 1: This is before.

519
00:30:43,724 --> 00:30:44,852
Speaker 0: you could buy a hard DDR pad.

520
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:45,920
Speaker 0: You can only buy soft ones.

521
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,960
Speaker 0: And we had a couple soft ones and we take a couple every few months.

522
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
Speaker 1: We had to order a couple.

523
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:51,634
Speaker 0: At least they're only like 20 or 30 bucks.

524
00:30:52,723 --> 00:30:54,559
Speaker 0: We duct taped them to the floor and that helped.

525
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,720
Speaker 1: And then when they break, we just duct tape new ones on top.

526
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,280
Speaker 0: And we would open them up and repair them.

527
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,370
Speaker 0: And the thing was, is that the main part of the DDR pad would not break.

528
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,300
Speaker 0: the part that was actually a basically a bootleg PlayStation controller was perfectly fine.

529
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:13,020
Speaker 0: It was the part of the pad, the physicality of it, the actual foot sensing area that would break.

530
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,000
Speaker 0: It was so shitty.

531
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:22,940
Speaker 1: So I had this pile of basically PlayStation one controllers with if I soldered wires onto them, I can make anything a PlayStation controller at a pile of them.

532
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:24,684
Speaker 1: And like Scott said, there were no.

533
00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:30,780
Speaker 1: not only were there no hard DDR pads you could buy, except for a couple of very boutique things that were very expensive and shitty.

534
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,460
Speaker 1: You couldn't even buy good soft pads.

535
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:34,403
Speaker 0: No, they didn't.

536
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:38,040
Speaker 0: You know, it's not like today where you can get the like the ignition or whatever, which we have.

537
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,660
Speaker 1: And I recall thinking, I'm just going to make one.

538
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:41,729
Speaker 1: I know how to solder.

539
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:42,940
Speaker 1: I got these controllers.

540
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:44,839
Speaker 1: I can totally make a hard DDR pad.

541
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:48,020
Speaker 1: And I go to DDR freaks, which I assume is still around.

542
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:52,580
Speaker 1: And they had a whole forum thread dedicated to people's hard DDR pad projects.

543
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:54,820
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to skip the whole story.

544
00:31:56,823 --> 00:32:03,060
Speaker 1: The people there would put their instructions like here is like Jojo's instructions for making a hard pad.

545
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:08,079
Speaker 1: These instructions had zero chance of success.

546
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:16,080
Speaker 1: These people did not understand the barest basic minimum of even like the simplest electronics.

547
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,200
Speaker 0: I mean, the thing is, if you already have a PlayStation controller, you don't actually need to know any electronics.

548
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:27,220
Speaker 0: All you need to know is, OK, look, the way this thing works is there's a circuit that is completed on this pin, right?

549
00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:29,660
Speaker 0: And if it's completed on that pin, that pushes the X button.

550
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:30,039
Speaker 0: All right.

551
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:30,979
Speaker 0: That's all there is to it.

552
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:40,020
Speaker 1: So one, these people, they didn't know how to solder and their explanations for how to solder to these cards to interface with them were disastrous.

553
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,760
Speaker 1: Absolutely disastrous.

554
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,340
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone in the forum knew how to solder with a dam.

555
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,480
Speaker 1: And half the questions were things like, yeah, I soldered together.

556
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:48,279
Speaker 1: Now it doesn't work.

557
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:49,199
Speaker 1: And they post a picture.

558
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:58,920
Speaker 1: And it was obvious that they had melted the entire board like they just melted a hole through it or their solder blob covered like five of the wires.

559
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,717
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

560
00:33:00,424 --> 00:33:01,559
Speaker 1: And they'd be like, why doesn't it work?

561
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,020
Speaker 1: And all the other responses would be like, I don't know.

562
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
Speaker 1: It looks like he soldered it.

563
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,560
Speaker 1: Maybe try buying another one.

564
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,479
Speaker 1: It must have been broken when blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

565
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,340
Speaker 1: And one for one of the things like the electricity goes over metal.

566
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:17,860
Speaker 0: If the if that metal is touching the other metal, then the electricity goes over.

567
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:20,540
Speaker 1: Oh, they thought they knew about electricity going over metal.

568
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:30,000
Speaker 1: So most of them, the way they suggested that you make the actual steps where you step, they didn't suggest like boundaries, switches or anything like that.

569
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,100
Speaker 1: You know, a smart way to do it or even micro switches.

570
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:44,040
Speaker 1: Their idea was get to like metal plates and cut them to be the right size and just solder the end of one of your long wires to one of them and solder the end of one of your long wires to the other one.

571
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:48,220
Speaker 1: And then put like insulation between the two and cut a hole in the middle.

572
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,200
Speaker 1: And when you step on it, the two plates will touch and connect the circuit.

573
00:33:51,821 --> 00:34:00,580
Speaker 1: And then people would connect these dodgy wires with shitty soldering to two aluminum plates and then stay and be like, yeah, even when I touch the plates directly together, it doesn't work.

574
00:34:01,024 --> 00:34:01,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder why.

575
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,880
Speaker 1: And the thing is, this project would be simple.

576
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,740
Speaker 1: It would take me about a week to make an awesome hard DDR pad today.

577
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:10,560
Speaker 0: Except for the actual physicality of the pad.

578
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,498
Speaker 1: Actually, that was the easiest part.

579
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,335
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

580
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:15,300
Speaker 1: Because I have basic woodworking skills.

581
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:17,119
Speaker 0: Are you going to make a wooden DDR pad?

582
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:18,819
Speaker 1: It was wooden, but then to get the top.

583
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,880
Speaker 0: Dude, we should make one with wooden arrows, like completely wooden.

584
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:26,239
Speaker 1: Actually, what I did was I took, you know, I made a base, right?

585
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,500
Speaker 1: And then over it, I made a frame that was in the right shape and it had nine holes where each individual like bit would fit.

586
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:35,980
Speaker 1: So you put either a button there or a plate there.

587
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:41,739
Speaker 1: To make the plates, I bought some thin sheet metal and I pounded it around pieces of wood that were the right size and shape.

588
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:44,380
Speaker 1: And it looked perfect and it was great.

589
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,295
Speaker 0: Did it work?

590
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,340
Speaker 1: It actually worked pretty well.

591
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,179
Speaker 0: I don't remember you ever actually using this thing.

592
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,219
Speaker 1: Because I used it when I lived at IBM and it worked pretty well, but it was too fragile and every time I moved it, it broke.

593
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,300
Speaker 1: So I threw it away eventually.

594
00:34:55,786 --> 00:34:55,978
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

595
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:02,860
Speaker 1: I couldn't, literally I put it in my car, I took it out and like the back just cracked and three of the soldering points popped off.

596
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,531
Speaker 0: I remember seeing like a few arrows.

597
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:05,960
Speaker 0: I don't remember seeing the whole thing.

598
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,079
Speaker 1: I'll try to find a picture of it.

599
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:07,520
Speaker 1: Alright.

600
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,805
Speaker 1: I mean, I used it to play some DDR.

601
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:16,140
Speaker 1: It just, it was too fragile, but my failings were failings of the fact that I didn't have enough money to buy good components.

602
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:23,360
Speaker 1: But it was amazing to look at all, like hundreds and hundreds of people who were dedicated to making a hard DDR pad who failed.

603
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,272
Speaker 1: They had, they made beautiful looking pads.

604
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,320
Speaker 1: They look way better than mine.

605
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,220
Speaker 1: They failed solely because they did not understand the basics of electricity, let alone electronics.

606
00:35:32,946 --> 00:35:33,068
Speaker 0: Yeah.

607
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:33,370
Speaker 0: Alright.

608
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:34,380
Speaker 0: Yeah.

609
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,120
Speaker 1: I feel like basic electricity should be required in all schooling, not just in like physics class.

610
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:47,200
Speaker 0: Well, maybe what we should do, right, is I don't want to do like a, like a how something works episode, but I kind of want to like encourage people to learn electricities.

611
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:56,620
Speaker 0: So maybe we should like, you know, uh, like teach the most basic parts of electricity in a humorous fashion and hopefully then people will go and study it for reals.

612
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:57,940
Speaker 1: I am an electron.

613
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:04,960
Speaker 0: I go if there is something there to go for, but, and a voltage gradient that pulls me along.

614
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:08,659
Speaker 0: If there is no voltage, I'm sitting my ass still.

615
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:13,613
Speaker 0: And then I will only go if there is actually something that is metal.

616
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,900
Speaker 0: If there's like a piece of rubber, I ain't going that way.

617
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,044
Speaker 1: I had an idea.

618
00:36:17,064 --> 00:36:18,208
Speaker 1: This is kind of a tangent.

619
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:18,830
Speaker 0: Okay.

620
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,380
Speaker 1: You know, the anarchist cookbook, the instructions are kind of dubious.

621
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:21,921
Speaker 0: Yeah.

622
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:27,380
Speaker 1: Why don't we make instructions that look like they'll make something cool, but really they just make a laden jar and then they zap you.

623
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:31,953
Speaker 0: You know, you get to kill someone with that though.

624
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:32,819
Speaker 1: You can make a week one.

625
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,835
Speaker 0: Uh, the thing is someone, you know, someone's going to be like, Oh, why does it matter what size jar I get?

626
00:36:37,855 --> 00:36:39,120
Speaker 0: I'll use my tomato jar.

627
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,081
Speaker 0: That's enough.

628
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:47,860
Speaker 0: Like if you use any jar bigger than like an eight ounce can, it's going to fucking, you know, it's dangerous shit.

629
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:54,099
Speaker 1: I remember when we locked the door to the physics room one day in high school and just we put the Van de Graaff generator behind it.

630
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,501
Speaker 0: Yeah.

631
00:36:54,681 --> 00:37:01,560
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, there was once a teacher of my high school science teacher who picked up the laden jar off the table and he didn't know that it was charged up.

632
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,990
Speaker 0: And he said it felt like someone hit him in the chest or the hammer.

633
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,737
Speaker 0: He's lucky it wasn't fully charged.

634
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:06,280
Speaker 0: He would have been dead.

635
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:06,681
Speaker 0: Yeah.

636
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:07,303
Speaker 0: Yeah.

637
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:08,046
Speaker 1: Yeah.

638
00:37:08,788 --> 00:37:11,015
Speaker 0: But yeah, basically, you know, electricity likes to go.

639
00:37:11,076 --> 00:37:12,360
Speaker 0: It goes in a circle, right?

640
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:14,588
Speaker 1: Well, only if it has a reason to.

641
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:15,111
Speaker 0: Yes.

642
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:16,539
Speaker 0: If it doesn't have a reason, it won't go.

643
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:22,300
Speaker 0: So at first you need the electricity to go on the wires and then you need to direct the electricity to go to the thing you want to go to.

644
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,519
Speaker 0: You know, everyone I think everyone knows that hook of a battery to like a light bulb.

645
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:25,760
Speaker 0: Right.

646
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Speaker 1: You know, because I like I feel like the way we'd have to do this is even do some videos because I imagine.

647
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:36,316
Speaker 0: Well, there's plenty of videos on the Internet that are already existing from Make magazine and many other places.

648
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:37,219
Speaker 0: We don't need to make videos.

649
00:37:37,259 --> 00:37:37,660
Speaker 0: It's redundant.

650
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,678
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I feel like most kids would look at a micro switch and not really know why there's three spots on it.

651
00:37:45,561 --> 00:37:45,844
Speaker 0: Really?

652
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:46,672
Speaker 1: Yeah, really.

653
00:37:46,693 --> 00:37:47,359
Speaker 0: I just I don't know.

654
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:48,002
Speaker 1: Tell us.

655
00:37:48,022 --> 00:37:49,105
Speaker 1: Do you guys know like?

656
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:53,640
Speaker 1: do you guys actually like without having to look it up, know how to just like wire a micro switch into something?

657
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:55,542
Speaker 0: I don't know.

658
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:56,987
Speaker 0: I don't think they know how to wire.

659
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:57,348
Speaker 0: They make.

660
00:37:57,469 --> 00:37:58,753
Speaker 1: Do you know what a real stat is?

661
00:37:58,773 --> 00:38:00,559
Speaker 0: I don't know what a real stat is.

662
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:00,840
Speaker 0: Really?

663
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,241
Speaker 0: No.

664
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:01,703
Speaker 1: Wow.

665
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:04,455
Speaker 1: I guess I use them to.

666
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:05,600
Speaker 1: I'd make circuits that would go.

667
00:38:11,361 --> 00:38:11,661
Speaker 0: All right.

668
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:14,046
Speaker 1: I don't think my parents liked it when I got into electronics.

669
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:20,940
Speaker 0: Well, that's the other thing is that back in the day would be totally chill to make dangerous like, you know, here is some electronic stuff, kid.

670
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:22,144
Speaker 0: People take shit apart.

671
00:38:22,204 --> 00:38:25,877
Speaker 0: Nowadays, even the stuff like Lego Mindstorms is in a plastic box.

672
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:26,680
Speaker 0: It's sealed shut.

673
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,927
Speaker 0: Kids don't know what's in there and they don't never open it either because it's an expensive thing.

674
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:37,440
Speaker 0: You're not open to that, you know, and even Radio Shack, you know, the chemistry sets and the electronic sets have been severely diminished.

675
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:42,876
Speaker 0: And it's only the Arduino kind of people that are pushing it back to the way it used to be.

676
00:38:43,497 --> 00:38:44,119
Speaker 0: But even then.

677
00:38:44,581 --> 00:38:44,801
Speaker 0: Right.

678
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:48,429
Speaker 0: A lot of the stuff that you do is because you have this microprocessor there.

679
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:50,614
Speaker 0: A lot of the stuff you're doing is in software.

680
00:38:50,674 --> 00:38:53,220
Speaker 0: Almost no one's doing anything completely in hardware anymore.

681
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:57,992
Speaker 0: You know, where you have to program by putting, you know, transistors on the thing.

682
00:38:58,032 --> 00:39:01,220
Speaker 0: You don't put down a single logic gate or a single transistor anywhere.

683
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:07,660
Speaker 0: You know, every almost everything you do is just, you know, the resistors, the capacitors, the input devices and the output devices.

684
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:15,540
Speaker 1: I feel like the best way to learn is to want to accomplish something very simple where you don't need the logic so much, but you do need the electronic apparatus.

685
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,146
Speaker 1: Like when I made my burglar alarm for my room as a kid.

686
00:39:18,206 --> 00:39:18,346
Speaker 1: Right.

687
00:39:18,386 --> 00:39:23,900
Speaker 1: First, I made one where if the wires touched, you know, the circuit was completed, the alarm went off.

688
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,328
Speaker 1: That's basically just a speaker hooked up to a battery.

689
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:27,612
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:28,936
Speaker 1: And that was well and good.

691
00:39:28,956 --> 00:39:30,040
Speaker 1: But it wasn't that practical.

692
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,884
Speaker 1: Like as a kid, I was like, this doesn't really work.

693
00:39:32,144 --> 00:39:33,467
Speaker 1: It is trivial to defeat this.

694
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:39,920
Speaker 1: So I thought really hard and I figured out how to make one that only tripped when the wire was disconnected.

695
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,257
Speaker 1: Oh, and figuring that out taught me way more about electronics than I think anything else in my life.

696
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:46,000
Speaker 0: It's like a trick.

697
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,745
Speaker 0: Like, I don't think most people could figure that out.

698
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:48,206
Speaker 0: Yeah.

699
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:50,052
Speaker 1: I got a little bit of help because, you know, I asked.

700
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:51,817
Speaker 1: There's this gnome we knew.

701
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:52,820
Speaker 1: Basically, he was a gnome.

702
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,888
Speaker 1: He was like the smartest engineer I've ever met in my life.

703
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:56,289
Speaker 1: He was.

704
00:39:56,549 --> 00:40:00,820
Speaker 1: And him and his wife and his daughter were all like super electronic engineering nerds.

705
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,623
Speaker 1: And their house was just a sea.

706
00:40:02,964 --> 00:40:04,467
Speaker 1: I looked like a mad scientist house.

707
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:05,530
Speaker 1: They were awesome people.

708
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:10,280
Speaker 1: And I remember I asked him and he would never answer a direct question because he wanted you to figure it out on your own.

709
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,628
Speaker 1: Any time you asked him a question how to do something, he would ask you another question.

710
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:14,470
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

711
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:16,215
Speaker 1: And I learned a lot from him.

712
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:17,740
Speaker 1: And I asked him a question or two.

713
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:19,204
Speaker 1: I don't remember really what I asked him.

714
00:40:19,224 --> 00:40:21,731
Speaker 1: And he was like, well, what if you blah, blah, blah?

715
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:22,714
Speaker 1: And I was like, huh?

716
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:24,840
Speaker 1: And I made an awesome burglar alarm.

717
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:29,819
Speaker 1: And the next day when it worked, my mom was like, you hiding something in your room that you don't want me to know about?

718
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,562
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

719
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:33,724
Speaker 0: Yeah.

720
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:34,245
Speaker 0: I just I see.

721
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:42,180
Speaker 0: That's the thing is I've always followed directions on any electronic thing I've made, you know, and I pretty much, you know, only know, you know, so much like I know.

722
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,670
Speaker 0: Hey, look, this led only says it needs this much voltage going in.

723
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,438
Speaker 0: And I got this much voltage from my battery power source.

724
00:40:48,498 --> 00:40:49,260
Speaker 0: I got to put a resistor.

725
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,304
Speaker 1: But if you set up something different, you can blow it up.

726
00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:51,905
Speaker 0: I know.

727
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:52,828
Speaker 1: And I could be cool.

728
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:58,020
Speaker 1: I think that the most learning in this realm occurs the second you have to go outside of the kit.

729
00:40:58,741 --> 00:41:04,052
Speaker 1: The moment you have a thing that you made from a kit and then you say, oh, but I really wanted to do this.

730
00:41:04,232 --> 00:41:04,954
Speaker 1: one other thing.

731
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:05,775
Speaker 1: What if I?

732
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:07,700
Speaker 1: and then you'll figure you'll learn so much more.

733
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:21,960
Speaker 1: Maybe the key is to make kits for kids, right, that will do something cool but are so close to doing something so much cooler, but you don't tell the kids how to do the thing cooler or you purposefully remove a feature.

734
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,924
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you don't tell them it's a feature.

735
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:25,067
Speaker 1: You don't advertise it.

736
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:30,400
Speaker 1: It's like you build a solenoid thing that will like shoot like it may.

737
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,603
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of a good example.

738
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:37,800
Speaker 1: You build a device that will use like make a nail hit a bell out of a solenoid and you can make a little keyboard with it.

739
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:44,017
Speaker 1: But if you construct it in the right way, it'll be obvious to a kid that make a nail gun if they tweak it just slightly.

740
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:45,020
Speaker 1: so nail gun.

741
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:45,702
Speaker 0: Yeah.

742
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,550
Speaker 1: And then the kid will figure that out.

743
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,780
Speaker 1: But he won't know how to do it because the book doesn't tell him.

744
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:54,313
Speaker 1: He can't ask his dad or his teacher, hey, I want to turn this into a weapon.

745
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:56,580
Speaker 1: So he'll try to figure it out himself.

746
00:41:56,761 --> 00:41:59,228
Speaker 1: And the smartest kid is going to have a nail gun.

747
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,220
Speaker 1: So kids, the secret to making a nail gun, the gimp, there are two.

748
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,845
Speaker 1: Because I figured this out as a kid and this worked really well.

749
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:12,100
Speaker 1: First, I was like, all right, if I power the solenoid, it pulls the metal rod in and holds it there.

750
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,622
Speaker 1: That's not good.

751
00:42:13,842 --> 00:42:14,023
Speaker 0: Nope.

752
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:21,800
Speaker 1: What if I make a timing circuit that as soon as the nail is in the middle, it turns off the solenoid and then it continues.

753
00:42:22,001 --> 00:42:23,424
Speaker 1: And it worked OK, but it's kind of gimpy.

754
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:29,540
Speaker 1: And then I was like, what if I just use a magnetic pole in the middle so it gets pushed all the way through?

755
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:31,103
Speaker 1: And suddenly I was in business.

756
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:39,720
Speaker 0: Actually, the way I would do it is I would I would just have it a physical thing, sort of push, you know, like a little hammer hit the nail.

757
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,501
Speaker 0: Right.

758
00:42:40,882 --> 00:42:43,166
Speaker 0: And I'd basically leave the magnet uncharged.

759
00:42:43,247 --> 00:42:49,720
Speaker 0: I would charge up some capacitors and then I would unleash the capacitors into the magnet at the same time that it hits the nail forward.

760
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:51,984
Speaker 1: Scott, here's the problem.

761
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:55,594
Speaker 1: So the nail is coming into the solenoid, right?

762
00:42:56,275 --> 00:42:58,000
Speaker 0: And because it's just sort of sitting in there.

763
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:58,300
Speaker 1: Yeah.

764
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:58,681
Speaker 1: So no.

765
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,008
Speaker 1: So you hit it and you energize the solenoid.

766
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:05,140
Speaker 1: The solenoid and the force of the hitting pull the nail into the center.

767
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:09,397
Speaker 1: The solenoid now resists the nail, leaving the center for the same reason that it pulled it in.

768
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:13,887
Speaker 0: You know what else you could do is you just take a car door lock.

769
00:43:13,947 --> 00:43:14,889
Speaker 0: Those are wicked powerful.

770
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:19,120
Speaker 0: Rip it right out of a car door and use that fucker.

771
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,584
Speaker 1: Scott, this is why you've got to think.

772
00:43:20,624 --> 00:43:24,920
Speaker 1: I mean, as a kid, you're trying to figure out how can I shoot this nail out with what I have?

773
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:26,364
Speaker 1: I have the solenoid.

774
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,649
Speaker 1: How do I make it shoot out?

775
00:43:27,669 --> 00:43:28,512
Speaker 1: It always holds it in.

776
00:43:28,853 --> 00:43:30,840
Speaker 1: And if I turn it off halfway through, it shoots out gimpily.

777
00:43:31,321 --> 00:43:42,120
Speaker 1: And then the kid will eventually realize that if you have a magnet being pulled in, north-south and north-south, you know, south and south always oppose, you'll push the thing all the way through.

778
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:44,840
Speaker 0: All right.

779
00:43:46,402 --> 00:43:47,865
Speaker 1: The idea, I think, stands still.

780
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:51,711
Speaker 1: You want to give kids something that does a kit that does something awesome.

781
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:56,440
Speaker 1: It has to actually do something that they care about, they think is cool, like burglar alarm for my room.

782
00:43:57,021 --> 00:44:00,047
Speaker 1: And you want to just leave just the hint to the smart kids.

783
00:44:00,147 --> 00:44:07,260
Speaker 1: only that, wait a minute, I could totally make this into a paintball gun instead of just a burglar alarm.

784
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:07,941
Speaker 0: Yeah.

785
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:14,600
Speaker 0: I think the thing is, right, is they've already, you know, more recently, all the electronics projects that have been given to kids are all robot kits, right?

786
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,154
Speaker 0: Even before Arduino, there is Arduino robot stuff, is they had like, you know, basic stamp stuff.

787
00:44:19,174 --> 00:44:21,240
Speaker 0: There are all these different things you could use to make robots.

788
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:27,653
Speaker 0: And the thing is, robots, you would put together the robot following a kit, but you would pretty much do the same thing every time.

789
00:44:27,673 --> 00:44:31,260
Speaker 0: You hook up a motor, you hook up the wheels, you hook up some lights, maybe.

790
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:32,920
Speaker 0: Maybe an infrared sensor.

791
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,822
Speaker 1: Not everything's like that.

792
00:44:33,943 --> 00:44:34,304
Speaker 1: I checked.

793
00:44:34,344 --> 00:44:34,725
Speaker 1: You know what?

794
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:40,300
Speaker 1: The Radio Shack Electronics Learning Lab is basically unchanged from 15 years ago.

795
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,000
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

796
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,902
Speaker 1: It costs the same.

797
00:44:42,022 --> 00:44:43,025
Speaker 1: I'm looking at it right now.

798
00:44:43,406 --> 00:44:44,168
Speaker 1: And look at this thing.

799
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:45,391
Speaker 1: This thing is not a robot.

800
00:44:45,431 --> 00:44:48,740
Speaker 1: It is literally just everything you need to make mischief.

801
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:49,442
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

802
00:44:49,843 --> 00:44:50,766
Speaker 0: And you should get one of those.

803
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:52,812
Speaker 0: The thing is, most Radio Shacks probably don't have that in stock.

804
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:55,280
Speaker 0: You have to buy that on the internets, you know.

805
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,007
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah, everyone gets these robots to learn electronics.

806
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:04,240
Speaker 0: And the thing is, when you get the robot, you basically put it together and then you never modify.

807
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:13,420
Speaker 0: All you do is modify the software because you're programming it to like, OK, robot, look, when you see a wall, then you need to turn around until you don't see a wall anymore with your little sensor.

808
00:45:13,781 --> 00:45:16,720
Speaker 1: But that's basically just playing with logo, but in Meatspace.

809
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:17,403
Speaker 0: Exactly.

810
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:21,680
Speaker 0: But that's what they've been teaching kids as far as electronics go for many years now.

811
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:27,032
Speaker 1: Well, part of it is maybe shop class is more the way to go because I was much more interested in that sort of thing.

812
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:30,000
Speaker 1: Like logo, when I was really little, I was like, I don't care about this.

813
00:45:30,581 --> 00:45:36,355
Speaker 1: And then in CNC class, I was like, oh, I can program a drill press to drill stuff.

814
00:45:36,515 --> 00:45:36,776
Speaker 1: Yeah.

815
00:45:36,996 --> 00:45:38,460
Speaker 1: And suddenly it got really interesting.

816
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,344
Speaker 0: I actually think the place to do is art class.

817
00:45:40,424 --> 00:45:40,604
Speaker 0: Right.

818
00:45:40,644 --> 00:45:48,520
Speaker 0: If you look, most of the people who are doing the exciting stuff with electronic, you know, simple home electronics these days are all artists making installations of various things.

819
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:48,801
Speaker 0: Right.

820
00:45:49,101 --> 00:45:50,183
Speaker 0: Go around the Maker Faire.

821
00:45:50,203 --> 00:45:50,825
Speaker 0: What do you see?

822
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:53,370
Speaker 0: You see someone making musical things.

823
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:58,480
Speaker 0: You see someone making, you know, putting LED lights to blink in a pattern on some clothing.

824
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:05,109
Speaker 0: You see somebody making some sort of, you know, magic mirror with some, you know, it's almost all art.

825
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:12,800
Speaker 0: It's hardly anyone is, you know, making, I mean, there are some people, but they're, you know, it's making like video games and other nerdy sorts of things.

826
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,389
Speaker 0: A lot of it is art and is like a whole, if you go to like NYU, you're not going to see any Arduinos in the CS department.

827
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:27,640
Speaker 0: You're going to see them in the art department where they're making cool, interactive shit for people to, you know, play with, you know, making toys, making all these sorts of things.

828
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:37,400
Speaker 0: So I think that we just need to introduce it in the art class and then maybe, you know, people get interested in it instead of being scared of it because they'll view it as they view like a crayon.

829
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:46,120
Speaker 1: Well, maybe part of that, too, is just giving them some sort of reason to want the end result, but no easy way to get to the end result.

830
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:50,345
Speaker 0: The thing is, people follow the path of least resistance, right?

831
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:56,535
Speaker 0: You need to, you need to give, but at the same time, you need to give them something easy that they will do and find fun to get them interested.

832
00:46:56,555 --> 00:46:59,780
Speaker 0: And once they're hooked, then, you know, they can get the challenge for learning.

833
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,004
Speaker 1: Well, I guess there are two different problems.

834
00:47:02,024 --> 00:47:05,190
Speaker 1: The first problem is get people who wouldn't otherwise be interested, interested.

835
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:10,320
Speaker 1: And the second problem is getting people who are already interested to become masters, not professionals.

836
00:47:10,692 --> 00:47:10,878
Speaker 0: No.

837
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:16,836
Speaker 1: I don't know, that was kind of rambling, but it's a shitty day and I'm really tired.

838
00:47:16,856 --> 00:47:17,720
Speaker 1: What do you want from me?

839
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:22,619
Speaker 0: People aren't learning electronic stuff enough, including, you know, us, so...

840
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,832
Speaker 1: I kind of want to make a DDR pad again.

841
00:47:24,872 --> 00:47:25,396
Speaker 1: I think this time...

842
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:26,788
Speaker 0: You have one, though.

843
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:27,618
Speaker 0: Why would you make one?

844
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,640
Speaker 1: I want a hard one so I can wear my shoes on it and do my double taps.

845
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,260
Speaker 0: Why don't you just, you know, there's got to be something better you can make.

846
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,380
Speaker 1: So here's what I wanted to do, right?

847
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,960
Speaker 0: I was thinking about making a cheating joystick where I could push one button and do a Hadouken.

848
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:49,238
Speaker 1: Well, what I really wanted to do way back, but I obviously could not afford this since I couldn't even afford basic electronics to make a good DDR pad.

849
00:47:49,558 --> 00:47:50,360
Speaker 1: I had to scrounge.

850
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:59,360
Speaker 1: But what I wanted to do was make a hard DDR pad where everything's metal and where you step for the footing is literally just depressed a little bit, but solid.

851
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:10,000
Speaker 1: And have a little laser array in each one that detects... Basically, if you step inside, it interrupts the laser, and it's a huge reflected laser, so anywhere you step in there is going to work.

852
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:16,020
Speaker 1: And you only have to step in, like, if you lift your foot up even, like, half a millimeter, you're not detected anymore.

853
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,569
Speaker 1: You could make a DDR pad...

854
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:18,780
Speaker 0: So there's no moving parts.

855
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,074
Speaker 1: No switches, no moving parts.

856
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:20,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

857
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,244
Speaker 1: That would actually be really cool.

858
00:48:22,665 --> 00:48:27,280
Speaker 1: And I kind of have the money to do it, but I'm not going to say I'm going to do it because that would be the biggest shit talk in the world.

859
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,200
Speaker 0: With extra steps, you have to clear the lasers, go out and in again.

860
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,959
Speaker 1: Exactly, so I'd have to make the laser component very low.

861
00:48:35,184 --> 00:48:36,240
Speaker 0: It'd be very, very tiny.

862
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,937
Speaker 1: Or what I could do is have the lasers go through some sort of Lexan material, so you still have a glass-looking step, right?

863
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:44,300
Speaker 1: But there's no physical switch.

864
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:53,360
Speaker 1: Instead, the lasers are bouncing through the Lexan, and use whatever kind of Lexan or figure it out to where, if the Lexan is compressed by any amount, it disrupts the laser's path.

865
00:48:54,503 --> 00:48:55,840
Speaker 1: That wouldn't be that hard to do at all.

866
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,762
Speaker 0: Interesting, very interesting.

867
00:48:59,223 --> 00:49:06,976
Speaker 0: I haven't seen anyone on any electronics things using anything that involves lasers and getting them cut.

868
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:08,298
Speaker 0: I haven't seen that part for sale.

869
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,046
Speaker 1: I actually used that a lot in middle school.

870
00:49:12,086 --> 00:49:14,813
Speaker 1: I got a laser pen way early because I thought it was awesome.

871
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:17,260
Speaker 1: And it was awesome for like 10 minutes, then I got bored with it.

872
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:23,635
Speaker 0: What you could use is you could use the Hall effect sensor, which is my bike computer.

873
00:49:23,655 --> 00:49:25,680
Speaker 0: There's a magnet on the spoke that spins around.

874
00:49:26,142 --> 00:49:29,039
Speaker 0: And there's the Hall effect sensor, which knows that a magnet has passed by.

875
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:32,419
Speaker 1: Well, you can do that with a magnet switch, too.

876
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:44,480
Speaker 0: Right, so what you could do is in the DDR pad, you basically put a magnet on each square, and you put a Hall effect sensor, and when you stepped, the magnet would get closer to the sensor.

877
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:47,560
Speaker 1: But at that point, I could just use a capacitive plate to do the same thing.

878
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,815
Speaker 0: But even if it got a little bit closer, the capacitive plate, you need to touch it with skin, right?

879
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:54,300
Speaker 0: You get to touch it with your foot with a shoe on.

880
00:49:54,620 --> 00:50:01,000
Speaker 1: No, because the way a lot of microphones work is the air or something moves the thing, and the thing itself is separated by a gap from another thing.

881
00:50:01,881 --> 00:50:04,409
Speaker 1: And that's where the capacitive gap is, not between you and the thing.

882
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:06,236
Speaker 1: Between the thing and the thing.

883
00:50:07,058 --> 00:50:07,500
Speaker 1: Double thing.

884
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,502
Speaker 0: Two things.

885
00:50:08,522 --> 00:50:13,420
Speaker 0: So you'd have someone's finger in the DDR pad, and you would step on their finger.

886
00:50:13,741 --> 00:50:21,580
Speaker 1: But what I would do is, actually, that was when we got disqualified, because we had the chemical reaction, where you mix two clear liquids, and they turn opaque yellow.

887
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,600
Speaker 1: And that blocked a laser, which then tripped a circuit, which did something awesome.

888
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:34,193
Speaker 1: But the pressure resulting from the reaction exploded the vessel we had put it into, and sprayed lead, mercurial, something.

889
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:35,055
Speaker 1: What was it?

890
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:36,096
Speaker 1: It was lead something.

891
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:38,000
Speaker 1: It was bad news, whatever it was.

892
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,182
Speaker 0: So anyway, what I did is, you know...

893
00:50:40,222 --> 00:50:41,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, chemistry nerds.

894
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:42,787
Speaker 1: Try to guess.

895
00:50:43,027 --> 00:50:43,528
Speaker 1: I'll look it up.

896
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:44,931
Speaker 1: Guess what reaction I used.

897
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:50,340
Speaker 1: Two clear liquids, mixed together, almost instantaneously turned opaque bright yellow.

898
00:50:51,401 --> 00:50:51,743
Speaker 0: Alright.

899
00:50:52,085 --> 00:50:52,810
Speaker 1: It was real.

900
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:53,433
Speaker 1: I did it.

901
00:50:53,715 --> 00:50:54,440
Speaker 1: It involved lead.

902
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,465
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I put together.

903
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:04,820
Speaker 0: so far, in terms of electronic stuff, I made that ice clock, which actually worked on the first try.

904
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,720
Speaker 0: And then I made the minty boost yesterday, and it worked on the first try, because I'm just so good.

905
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,722
Speaker 0: But these are all kits following instructions.

906
00:51:11,783 --> 00:51:16,510
Speaker 0: I ordered one more kit, which is basically a mini POV.

907
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:22,500
Speaker 0: It's basically LED lights, and you program it to say something, and you wave it around, and it will draw whatever it is that you drew in the air.

908
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,552
Speaker 0: You know how they do the thing with the bike spokes, going around in a circle, with the LEDs?

909
00:51:26,893 --> 00:51:28,839
Speaker 0: It's like that, only you hold it in the air and just wave it.

910
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:34,936
Speaker 0: And it knows how fast you're waving, I guess with an accelerometer maybe, so it can write things up.

911
00:51:34,997 --> 00:51:36,160
Speaker 0: You can see it on YouTube in action.

912
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:41,500
Speaker 0: So I ordered one of those, but I also, because I said, alright, it's enough kit action, I need to make something, right?

913
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,492
Speaker 0: Just for learning purposes, I ordered one of those tiny LCD screens.

914
00:51:45,512 --> 00:51:46,255
Speaker 0: It's like 16x2, right?

915
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:57,920
Speaker 0: So I can get some outputs, and I ordered a $2 temperature sensor, so I'm going to try to detect the temperature, and then write it to a screen, and make a thermometer.

916
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:08,199
Speaker 0: And then I looked online, and there's so many sensors, and I was like, dude, if I buy every sensor they have, I could make a weather station better than the expensive ones for maybe 30 bucks.

917
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,229
Speaker 0: Get a humidity sensor, I can get all sorts of shit.

918
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:15,880
Speaker 0: I can use the hall effect sensor to make an anemometer.

919
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:22,060
Speaker 1: I think that hall effect sensor, Scott, is an example of, you've got a hammer, and everything looks like a nail.

920
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,062
Speaker 0: No, I mean, that's right.

921
00:52:23,122 --> 00:52:24,867
Speaker 0: It's the same as the bike wheel, right?

922
00:52:24,887 --> 00:52:30,040
Speaker 0: You have a spinning anemometer, and I would put a magnet on it, and I would know how many times it spanned around.

923
00:52:31,303 --> 00:52:33,760
Speaker 1: There are many times better ways to go about that sort of thing.

924
00:52:34,022 --> 00:52:35,139
Speaker 0: To know how fast something is spinning?

925
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,425
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what you're trying to do.

926
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,860
Speaker 1: You don't rely on the hall effect sensor for everything.

927
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:46,860
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, they've got all these sensors that you can buy, and there's plenty enough of them to detect all sorts of weather.

928
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,596
Speaker 0: I saw a digital barometer I can buy for a few dollars.

929
00:52:50,897 --> 00:52:51,560
Speaker 0: That's pretty awesome.

930
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,940
Speaker 1: See, as much as I want to make my hard DDR pad, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to do that anytime soon.

931
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:00,032
Speaker 0: Well, this is something that is very small that can go on my desk.

932
00:53:00,072 --> 00:53:02,120
Speaker 0: It is not something that is big and requires a wood shop.

933
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,220
Speaker 0: It is very good for New York City, whereas a DDR pad would be good for the country in the barn.

934
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:11,340
Speaker 1: I kind of want to do something with home automation, now that I've got this apartment.

935
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is, the things you can buy are so much better than anything you could...

936
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:18,860
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but basically I want to automate the shades going up and down.

937
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,252
Speaker 0: You could just hook up little motors to the shades.

938
00:53:21,272 --> 00:53:22,320
Speaker 0: It would be pretty strong, though.

939
00:53:22,801 --> 00:53:23,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, stepper motors.

940
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:27,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then just make a remote control infrared, something like that.

941
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:36,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then I'd control it, because I want to be able to... My ideal thing is I would have a temperature sensor, and it would basically figure out if it's too hot or cold.

942
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:40,060
Speaker 1: When we're out away from home, and it would razor-lower the shades.

943
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:46,460
Speaker 0: You could actually use a solar cell, and if it's getting all charged up, it would lower it down after it charges.

944
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:50,309
Speaker 0: And then, when it's starting to get dark, it would...

945
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,020
Speaker 1: Oh, Scott, so that's actually how old audio compressors worked.

946
00:53:58,642 --> 00:53:59,380
Speaker 0: With the solar cell?

947
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:09,040
Speaker 1: There'd be a light and a photo cell, and the light would get brighter as the sound got louder, and then the photo cell would detect.

948
00:54:09,942 --> 00:54:11,319
Speaker 1: That's basically how that old shit worked.

949
00:54:12,143 --> 00:54:12,972
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, well, there you go.

950
00:54:12,992 --> 00:54:13,700
Speaker 0: You could totally do that.

951
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,019
Speaker 1: You want to know how echo chamber, like an echo, like a reverb device used to work?

952
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:23,719
Speaker 1: It was literally a rack-mount device with a bunch of space inside of it, and a speaker on one end, and a microphone on the other end.

953
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:25,762
Speaker 0: Whoa.

954
00:54:25,783 --> 00:54:25,865
Speaker 0: Whoa.

955
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:29,740
Speaker 1: We are definitely spoiled by our digital world.

956
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,603
Speaker 0: We are indeed.

957
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:33,740
Speaker 0: And you should learn how our digital world works, so you aren't a caveman.

958
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,880
Speaker 1: But you should also know how to goddamn solder.

959
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:36,680
Speaker 0: Yes.

960
00:54:38,301 --> 00:54:38,809
Speaker 1: Solder, eh?

961
00:54:38,951 --> 00:54:39,439
Speaker 1: Not sold out?

962
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:39,876
Speaker 0: Solder.

963
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,280
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

964
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,420

970
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,480
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

971
00:55:37,944 --> 00:55:39,079
Speaker 0: Oh, what are we going to call this bitch?

972
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,994
Speaker 0: Oh, let me make my headphones good.

973
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,480
Speaker 0: All right.

974
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,000
Speaker 0: Ooh.

975
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:42,323
Speaker 0: Ooh.

976
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:45,430
Speaker 1: All right.

977
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:46,524
Speaker 1: It's Monday, October 4th.

978
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:50,840
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

979
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:51,718
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

980
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,003
Speaker 0: And this is Blinking Light at the Window is Annoying.

981
00:55:56,493 --> 00:55:57,710
Speaker 1: Scott is easily distracted.

982
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,390
Speaker 0: All right, let's do an actual opener.
