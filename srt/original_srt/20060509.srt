1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,289
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, May 9th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,359
Speaker 1: Tonight, we drop the bob-omb and bring you our coverage of E3.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,018
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,720
Speaker 0: This morning, I pulled my car into the parking lot at work, and I see something.

5
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:24,712
Speaker 1: It wasn't E3, was it?

6
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:26,693
Speaker 0: No, it was not E3.

7
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:33,430
Speaker 0: And I saw it out of the corner of my eye, and it took like a full like 10 seconds for me to go.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,213
Speaker 0: "hah-wah-hah-wah,".

9
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:39,539
Speaker 0: and I looked again, and yeah, there's a Ferrari in the parking lot at work.

10
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:40,317
Speaker 1: Which one?

11
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:42,599
Speaker 0: It's an F430, it looks like to me.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,024
Speaker 1: Huh.

13
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,660
Speaker 0: And I was like, huh, what's that doing there?

14
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:47,838
Speaker 1: You should have jacked it.

15
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:49,200
Speaker 0: I don't know how.

16
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:53,139
Speaker 1: I don't know, you get into it, and you hotwire it, and then you jack it.

17
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,448
Speaker 0: It's not that easy.

18
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:55,094
Speaker 0: It's a Ferrari.

19
00:00:56,761 --> 00:01:00,480
Speaker 0: It's not like, you know, jacking a freaking Hyundai on the street.

20
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,739
Speaker 0: Anyway, I took two pictures of it, and they're on my Flickr.

21
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott messaged me at work and says, "Hey, there's a Ferrari

22
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:08,380
Speaker 1: here.".

23
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:16,460
Speaker 0: I don't know who it belonged to, it drove away when I wasn't looking, and it's not like one of those V12s that you can hear when it leaves the parking lot, so.

24
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:18,780
Speaker 0: And I was kind of in the building, so.

25
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:28,980
Speaker 1: All I could think of was a moment at Otacon this previous year, where everyone else, they were all standing in line, Scott and the whole front-reel crew, waiting to get their badges.

26
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:34,580
Speaker 1: I already had my badge, because, you know, I got in free, and I didn't have to do anything.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,490
Speaker 1: So I was walking back to the hotel room with a, "Fuck you guys, I'm gonna take a Nat

28
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:40,355
Speaker 1: deal.".

29
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,299
Speaker 1: And on my way back, I get a call from Scott.

30
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:45,596
Speaker 0: You get a call, like, right after you leave us.

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,200
Speaker 1: I'm around the corner.

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,439
Speaker 0: You're with us, and you walk around the corner, and then I see a red hotiroku.

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,754
Speaker 1: So he calls me, and he's like, "There's a red

34
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:55,400
Speaker 1: hotiroku.".

35
00:01:55,521 --> 00:02:00,034
Speaker 1: And I stop, and I look, and then it comes around the corner and drives past me, and I go, "Yeah, I just saw it,

36
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:00,256
Speaker 1: cool.".

37
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:05,784
Speaker 1: And then, apparently, everyone around them was like, "What the hell?

38
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:07,393
Speaker 1: He called his friend to tell him there was a

39
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:08,176
Speaker 1: hotiroku?".

40
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:09,814
Speaker 0: Yeah!

41
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:10,280
Speaker 0: Fuck yeah!

42
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,380
Speaker 0: So, um, that's the last thing we're gonna talk about on today's show that is not E3 related.

43
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,465
Speaker 0: Weeeee!

44
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:23,260
Speaker 0: And we're not gonna refrain from making too many Wii jokes.

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,682
Speaker 1: Wii 3!

46
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:28,579
Speaker 0: I can't wait to hold the Wii, to get the Wii in my hands.

47
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:33,098
Speaker 1: I'm gonna hold it, I'm gonna swing it around, hopefully I won't put anyone's eye out.

48
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,238
Speaker 0: Okay, so news.

49
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,800
Speaker 1: Alright, so in the news, we have some E3 news, obviously.

50
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,799
Speaker 1: You know what?

51
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:41,683
Speaker 0: You know what?

52
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:50,740
Speaker 0: The entire rest of the world outside of California just stopped, and everyone stood in place, while E3 went on, so nothing else happened at all.

53
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,100
Speaker 1: Alright, so, considering that we're probably going to talk at length about Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.

54
00:02:57,943 --> 00:03:03,140
Speaker 0: So everyone knows, this podcast might be really, really long.

55
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:03,756
Speaker 1: Yeah.

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,300
Speaker 0: Longer than most geek nights, and most other podcasts, actually.

57
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,340
Speaker 0: So, be prepared to listen for a while.

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,233
Speaker 0: We're not gonna split it up into three separate ones.

59
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,839
Speaker 0: We're giving it to you all in one go.

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,460
Speaker 1: Which is gonna be great three weeks from now, and we have nothing to do on a Tuesday.

61
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:20,399
Speaker 0: I know, no.

62
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:29,900
Speaker 0: Next Tuesday we'll probably take care of all the other E3 tidbits that come out during the show, because the actual show doesn't start until tomorrow.

63
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:32,939
Speaker 0: This is just the three major press conferences we're talking about.

64
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,797
Speaker 0: And then the week after that, we'll probably have the new Mario Bros.

65
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,927
Speaker 0: for the DS, and we'll talk about that.

66
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:41,880
Speaker 0: Tuesday, not the Monday.

67
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:42,699
Speaker 0: So we'll be good.

68
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:50,540
Speaker 1: But since we're gonna cover Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony in the main bits, we're gonna cover some non-Microsoft Sony/Nintendo news.

69
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:51,339
Speaker 0: Awesome.

70
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:52,959
Speaker 1: Now, you all know Red Octane.

71
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,180
Speaker 1: They are famous for their Bimani stuff.

72
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,820
Speaker 0: Well, they were originally coming to rent video games sort of a Netflix style, right?

73
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they weren't that successful, but I signed up for them.

74
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,260
Speaker 0: Do they still do that at all?

75
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:05,560
Speaker 1: I don't actually know.

76
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:06,879
Speaker 0: I don't think they do.

77
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:14,840
Speaker 1: All I know is that way, way back, when I was a freshman in college, Red Octane was around, and I wanted to get import games for the PS1 that I had just bought.

78
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,740
Speaker 0: I know, Red Octane still has Game Rental.

79
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:17,898
Speaker 1: Oh, cool.

80
00:04:18,503 --> 00:04:19,418
Speaker 0: Netflix style, yeah.

81
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,579
Speaker 1: Because when I had them, they were actually really good.

82
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:27,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Red Octane is a game rental company, but what they eventually did is they sold DDR pads.

83
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:34,540
Speaker 1: Well, what happened is that they sold a couple of DDR things, and they sold, like, accessories for PlayStation games, in addition to having the rental system.

84
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:44,280
Speaker 1: I guess they noticed that, far and away, the only people who signed up with them got the import games, and far and away, people wanted all the DDRs that weren't in the US.

85
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was the-- Red Octane.

86
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:56,251
Speaker 0: somehow, by chance, in making a game rental service, and selling dance pads, became the easiest and best place to get DDR equipment.

87
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:57,339
Speaker 0: if you were a DDR fan.

88
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,479
Speaker 0: So when DDR exploded, Red Octane got the green.

89
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,413
Speaker 1: Because back then, we didn't have any DDRs.

90
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:11,740
Speaker 1: So I signed up for Red Octane, and for a month, all I did was get various foreign DDRs, copy them with my Plex store, and then send them back immediately.

91
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,239
Speaker 0: That's a good way to go.

92
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,120
Speaker 1: I then quit my free trial one day before I would have had to pay.

93
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:16,780
Speaker 0: Awesome.

94
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:20,600
Speaker 1: That's how I got every DDR, and we played them extensively.

95
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,939
Speaker 0: If you want to get every DDR for the PlayStation 1, sign up for Red Octane.

96
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:29,880
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Red Octane became the premier place for DDRs and stuff.

97
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,420
Speaker 1: They make the best non-cobalt flux blue pads you can get.

98
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,640
Speaker 0: So then they got into the business of making DDR pads.

99
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,380
Speaker 1: Which was extremely lucrative.

100
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:39,948
Speaker 1: Their soft pad is awesome.

101
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,558
Speaker 1: I highly recommend it to anyone who likes DDR.

102
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you're really hardcore, you can get the hard pad.

103
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,375
Speaker 1: So then, Guitar Hero.

104
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:49,132
Speaker 0: Yeah, they said, "Hey, we're doing really well.

105
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:50,037
Speaker 0: Let's actually make some

106
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:50,420
Speaker 0: games.".

107
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:53,220
Speaker 0: So they made In the Groove, and In the Groove 2.

108
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,040
Speaker 1: Which are kind of terrible.

109
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, In the Groove 2 is good.

110
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,363
Speaker 0: Eh.

111
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,280
Speaker 0: I don't know what you're probably-- Where'd you change your mind?

112
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:02,349
Speaker 1: No, they're great, but they're just-- They've got some gimmicks in them.

113
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,740
Speaker 1: They're not that easy to find.

114
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:05,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

115
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, then they made Guitar Hero.

116
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,480
Speaker 0: 'Cause they was, you know, keep going with the Bimani deal.

117
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,459
Speaker 1: Guitar Hero was the sleeper hit, for anyone who doesn't know.

118
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think everyone knows about Guitar Hero.

119
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:17,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, Guitar Hero is at every con now.

120
00:06:18,521 --> 00:06:22,400
Speaker 1: It's as ubiquitous as DDR used to be at the early cons.

121
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,360
Speaker 0: Well, 'cause they think they was guitar freaks, but no one really got into it.

122
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,440
Speaker 0: And I think Red Octane had a bunch of Guitar Freaks guitars lying around.

123
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,374
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's the same guitar used in Guitar Hero or not, but-- Well, people really got into Guitar Freaks.

124
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:38,600
Speaker 1: The problem was, it was hard to get.

125
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,222
Speaker 0: Yeah.

126
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:42,220
Speaker 0: So Red Octane made Guitar Hero, and they made it real accessible.

127
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:49,180
Speaker 1: Anyway, to make a long, long, long story short, before we go any further on the history of Red Octane, they just got done bought out by Activision.

128
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,100
Speaker 0: Yep, Activision just bought Red Octane, just ch-ching!

129
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,260
Speaker 1: Straight up and suddenly, and they announced it today.

130
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,855
Speaker 0: So, what does this mean for Red Octane?

131
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:57,279
Speaker 0: Not much.

132
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,960
Speaker 0: They're gonna let Red Octane keep doing its business, 'cause it's doing good business.

133
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,600
Speaker 1: Activision doesn't do such good business, so if Activision decided to screw with Red Octane, that's the end.

134
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,059
Speaker 0: Yep, so Red Octane's gonna keep doing its good business.

135
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:23,040
Speaker 0: They're gonna put the Activision label, obviously, on future Red Octane games, maybe help Red Octane out by publishing the games with Activision's mighty publishing powers, but-- I'm not worried that any trouble will come of it, because if it does, the internet will explode.

136
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one's gonna let anything happen to good ol' Red Octane.

137
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,900
Speaker 1: So, uh, is there any other non-Nintendo Sony/Microsoft news?

138
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,859
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's also DDR-related.

139
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:44,100
Speaker 0: There's going to be, according to Konami and their press conference that happened just now, um, there's going to be a DDR television show.

140
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,060
Speaker 1: We're not sure just yet what this entails.

141
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,780
Speaker 0: There's going to be a live, live television show based on Dance Dance Revolution.

142
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
Speaker 0: The name of the show will be called Dance Revolution.

143
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:58,920
Speaker 1: Gasp!

144
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,120
Speaker 0: It'll be on CBS this fall.

145
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:11,850
Speaker 0: Um, I'm not sure-- But I see torrents of the first episode and a Geek Nights episode talking about the first episode of the show.

146
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,994
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what it could be.

147
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:26,830
Speaker 1: I mean, I could see them having, like, songs of the day or songs of the week that they show on screen and show people dance, they get cool people to dance 'em, and then maybe they're gonna sell the songs they show on the show on the Xbox 360 over the internet thingy.

148
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,675
Speaker 0: I could see it being a game show.

149
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:31,042
Speaker 0: I could see it being a kids' show.

150
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:33,350
Speaker 0: I could see it being an instructional show.

151
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,477
Speaker 1: A tournament show.

152
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:36,169
Speaker 1: A workout-type show.

153
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:36,953
Speaker 0: A game show.

154
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:37,999
Speaker 0: A workout show.

155
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,662
Speaker 0: Who knows?

156
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:40,150
Speaker 0: It could be a bunch of different things.

157
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,530
Speaker 0: But whatever it is, I'm gonna be looking out for it.

158
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though we don't play DDR so much anymore.

159
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,850
Speaker 0: No, but we would if it didn't shake our house.

160
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:58,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sad, but the floor--our house is great--but the floor does not stand up to 250 to 170 pound men jumping up and down repeatedly.

161
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:01,870
Speaker 0: Yep, uh, that's why we need a basement.

162
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:05,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, or we could just, you know, go to the arcade, but you never wanna go.

163
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,577
Speaker 0: It's too much money.

164
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:08,685
Speaker 0: I paid for the stupid pad.

165
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:09,490
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna pay for the arcade.

166
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,439
Speaker 1: What, the pad you can't use?

167
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,690
Speaker 1: You might as well just play in the arcade.

168
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,186
Speaker 0: No, I'm paying twice.

169
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:13,510
Speaker 0: Anyway.

170
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:20,982
Speaker 1: Whatever.

171
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:21,823
Speaker 1: So, things of the day.

172
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:23,747
Speaker 1: I got one little bit.

173
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,109
Speaker 1: It's obviously from E3.

174
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,821
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's hard to find a thing of the day from E3.

175
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:34,810
Speaker 0: I mean, I may find some remix videos somewhere, but they haven't been finished yet, so you're gonna have to give me another few days on those.

176
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:41,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically, I just wanted to take something--something that happened at E3 that I wouldn't have talked about any other place, really.

177
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,630
Speaker 1: Now, Kotaku had this, and they noticed, and I've noticed that many other people reporting on E3 have said something similar.

178
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,429
Speaker 1: As far as anyone can say, no one other than Sony had PSPs at E3.

179
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:56,089
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

180
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,610
Speaker 1: No one saw anyone playing one.

181
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:08,850
Speaker 1: They did, however, see that almost every line, almost every waiting room, almost every lobby was filled with people playing wireless, Tetris, or wireless whatnot on the DS.

182
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:09,669
Speaker 0: Picked a chat.

183
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,264
Speaker 1: The DS pretty much dominated E3.

184
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:14,470
Speaker 1: Almost everyone had one.

185
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,175
Speaker 0: Well, because the thing about the PSP is it's a one-man show.

186
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:22,866
Speaker 0: If you take out a PSP, you're all--you know, even if everyone else around you has a PSP, you can't do anything with them.

187
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:23,988
Speaker 0: You're all alone.

188
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:26,443
Speaker 1: It's like-- Well, there are games that use the wireless.

189
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:27,310
Speaker 1: They're just not very good.

190
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:31,350
Speaker 0: Are there really PSP games that use wireless to play with other people near you?

191
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,023
Speaker 1: Supposedly.

192
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:32,717
Speaker 0: Really?

193
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:33,390
Speaker 0: What games are those?

194
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:33,987
Speaker 0: I don't know.

195
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,836
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

196
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:39,269
Speaker 1: Oh, well, but-- The one guy I met at a con who had a PSP said there were.

197
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:39,614
Speaker 0: Oh.

198
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:40,910
Speaker 1: I didn't bother him about it.

199
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:53,090
Speaker 0: Well, even with the loading times and all that, I mean, it's a lot easier to get a game of Tetris together, especially when the--'cause the--there's no way the PSP games have the download play, where you don't need the cartridge or the UMD.

200
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:53,929
Speaker 1: Oh, no way.

201
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there you go.

202
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:56,216
Speaker 0: That's the answer.

203
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:57,560
Speaker 0: One guy has Tetris.

204
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,121
Speaker 0: Boom!

205
00:10:58,181 --> 00:10:59,465
Speaker 0: Ten DSs come out.

206
00:10:59,745 --> 00:10:59,986
Speaker 0: There.

207
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:01,169
Speaker 0: That's why--.

208
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,950
Speaker 1: Well, plus, honestly, the PSP just--the games it has seem to be the same games that the PlayStation 2 has.

209
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:08,810
Speaker 0: Oh, there's more news on that later.

210
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,436
Speaker 1: They're the kind of games that you sit down and just play.

211
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:14,444
Speaker 1: You can't play that with people because you'll just be sitting there playing your GTA--.

212
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:20,879
Speaker 0: Not a lot, but not as many as a DS, but quite a few.

213
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:25,690
Speaker 0: The thing is, you don't bring them to social situations 'cause they're not useful in social situations.

214
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only people who--the only time you see PSPs about in number are on, like, subways and commuter trains.

215
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see a PSP when you see, you know, an iPod or something.

216
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:35,860
Speaker 0: Someone's on a train.

217
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:39,267
Speaker 0: Someone's--a kid sitting in the back of a car.

218
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:40,610
Speaker 0: That's when you see a PSP.

219
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,149
Speaker 1: Of course, you see the DSs there, too.

220
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:49,734
Speaker 0: Yeah, 'cause the DS does that, and it's good at the cons and all that stuff, so... Alright, my thing of the day.

221
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:54,650
Speaker 0: At the Nintendo conference, you might have remembered there was an AOL contest.

222
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,950
Speaker 0: And the contest was whoever--you just entered your name and whatnot at AOL, whatever.

223
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:10,390
Speaker 0: And if you won the contest, you would go onstage at E3 this morning, and you would be the first person who is not a developer or a whatnot.

224
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:11,909
Speaker 0: I keep saying whatnot today.

225
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:12,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, what the hell.

226
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:13,750
Speaker 0: What the hell, yeah.

227
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:16,689
Speaker 1: It's like, um, you so, uh, like, uh...

228
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,149
Speaker 0: Like, like whatnot, you know?

229
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:23,930
Speaker 0: The first consumer to use the Wii.

230
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:26,313
Speaker 1: We were all about that.

231
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:27,417
Speaker 1: I mean, I hate AOL.

232
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:28,901
Speaker 1: I hate online contests.

233
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:29,784
Speaker 1: I hate lotteries.

234
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:31,810
Speaker 1: I entered that contest.

235
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,758
Speaker 0: I entered the contest.

236
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:33,790
Speaker 0: I didn't win.

237
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:34,910
Speaker 1: Obviously.

238
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:37,737
Speaker 0: Apparently what happened was, it wasn't just one person.

239
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:43,390
Speaker 0: Three people won the trip out to E3, and they were all sitting at the Nintendo conference.

240
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,656
Speaker 0: One of the three was randomly picked by Miyamoto.

241
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:54,170
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was randomly or not, but they said, I guess he picked out of a hat, or they had a card with the name on it.

242
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:55,350
Speaker 0: Sort of like the Oscars.

243
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:02,690
Speaker 0: And there were three kids there, and they were both 20-something guys, which is kinda--or they looked like 20-something guys.

244
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,074
Speaker 1: Both?

245
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:03,830
Speaker 1: I--weren't there three?

246
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:04,409
Speaker 0: There were three.

247
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:05,178
Speaker 1: You said both.

248
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:06,029
Speaker 1: Both implies two.

249
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,440
Speaker 1: Alright.

250
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:07,188
Speaker 1: You suck.

251
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:16,290
Speaker 0: All three of them looked like schmucky guys, but one guy was a real fat bleh guy, and another guy was a slightly fat bleh guy.

252
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,928
Speaker 1: Fat like the, uh, scary fanboy from club back in the day.

253
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:23,953
Speaker 0: who-- Fat like, I was like, God, like, you know what I'm saying, like-- Like Mr.

254
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,270
Speaker 1: Earlobes, who we won't actually name on the air.

255
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:33,390
Speaker 0: They were fat in a way--he was fat in a way where I said to myself, God, I hope he doesn't win so I don't have to look at him anymore.

256
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,185
Speaker 0: So the fat guy who didn't get to go on stage at E3 and use the Wii is my thing of the day.

257
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:41,910
Speaker 0: Way to go, fat guy.

258
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:45,585
Speaker 1: I can see Miyamoto sitting there in his head, he's like, I can't pick that kid.

259
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:46,590
Speaker 1: He'll break the stage.

260
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,450
Speaker 0: They picked the best looking guy from my cursory glance at the three fools.

261
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:58,330
Speaker 1: You know what, to anyone out there who, you know, inner beauty and all, but in the real world, looks count.

262
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one's gonna pick you to go on stage at their very important press conference if you're a fat, ugly schmuck.

263
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,209
Speaker 1: Or you've got like nine eyes and six fingers.

264
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:12,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, watch, this fat guy is a Geek Nights listener, he'd be like, hey, that was me!

265
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:15,850
Speaker 0: And he's actually a cool guy or something.

266
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,650
Speaker 1: You know what, if you're that guy and you listen right now, we'll put you on the air and apologize.

267
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:26,250
Speaker 0: Well, I won't apologize for calling you fat, I'll just apologize for calling you a schmuck.

268
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:29,050
Speaker 0: Maybe you're not a schmuck, but you're fat.

269
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, do something about that.

270
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might want to exercise or something.

271
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:34,310
Speaker 0: Okay.

272
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,169
Speaker 0: Alright, let's start talking about our favorite current existing system, the Nintendo DS.

273
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,930
Speaker 1: It is my primary gaming console currently.

274
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:47,530
Speaker 0: As it is mine, and there are no signs that it will fade.

275
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:52,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the other day, for whatever reason, I pulled out Advance Wars and I started playing it again.

276
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:59,110
Speaker 1: And I remembered that, oh yeah, every game I've bought for this system so far, except WarioWare Touched, has been badass.

277
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,110
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, if WarioWare Touched had multiplayer, it would be badass.

278
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,868
Speaker 0: And hopefully a new WarioWare DS will come out, but one wasn't announced at E3.

279
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, however, we got the revolution Wii one, but...

280
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:11,769
Speaker 0: We're gonna get to that.

281
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,149
Speaker 0: We will.

282
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:13,450
Speaker 0: Don't spoil things.

283
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:20,230
Speaker 0: Oh, I just want to say, before we start going here, we're not here on Gig Nights to inform you.

284
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,608
Speaker 0: We are not the news story that tells you what happened at E3.

285
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,410
Speaker 0: We are the Slashdot comments under that story.

286
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,030
Speaker 1: Yes, we're not even gonna link to a lot of the things we talk about, because it's everywhere.

287
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,814
Speaker 0: So, here's some hints.

288
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:35,045
Speaker 0: Number one, go to E3buzz.com.

289
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:36,730
Speaker 0: E. the number three buzz dot com.

290
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:45,848
Speaker 0: Basically, they took all the RSS feeds of all the major video game news sites and combined them into one site, so you can watch what goes down at E3 in real time.

291
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,230
Speaker 1: I pretty much just had it open all day.

292
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,550
Speaker 0: I had it open, and I used the Reload Every Firefox plugin.

293
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,281
Speaker 0: Go to GameSpot dot com, they have good stuff.

294
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,950
Speaker 0: Read Kotaku and Joystiq.

295
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:02,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want a good summary, like you just want an overview of the things worth noting, Kotaku is probably your best bet.

296
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:05,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, Kotaku and Gadget has good stuff when it comes to hardware.

297
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,730
Speaker 0: You know, they partner with Joystiq as the same company.

298
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:11,610
Speaker 0: They have really good live blogs at the press conferences.

299
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:18,210
Speaker 0: So, you'll get some information from listening to us talk, but we're not gonna give you the full lowdown.

300
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,970
Speaker 0: We're gonna give you the commentary and what we say about stuff.

301
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically just reactions.

302
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:23,771
Speaker 0: Yes.

303
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,012
Speaker 0: Alright.

304
00:16:24,814 --> 00:16:25,296
Speaker 0: DS.

305
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:29,328
Speaker 0: The DS Lite, which we already kind of knew this, but they announced it for 100% real.

306
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:33,503
Speaker 0: On June 11th of this year, for $130, you can get a DS Lite in the USA.

307
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:43,790
Speaker 1: Now, never in my life have I fallen to that "ooh, the console you just bought came out again slightly shinier, buy it" mentality.

308
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:45,469
Speaker 0: I didn't even buy the Game Boy SP.

309
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:46,890
Speaker 0: I still don't own one.

310
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,150
Speaker 0: I use the regular old GBA for, you know.

311
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,050
Speaker 0: Now I kind of think maybe I'll get an SP because I have some old Game Boy and Game Boy Color games that I can play on it.

312
00:16:56,411 --> 00:17:00,770
Speaker 0: And I kind of want to buy up some used Game Boy Color and Game Boy games to play on it.

313
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,690
Speaker 0: And it's also good because we'll still probably use it for the GameCube uplink.

314
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:11,148
Speaker 0: You know, especially if we want to play the old FFCC or Four Swords on the Wii.

315
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,970
Speaker 0: With the backwards, you know, because they have GameCube holes on the Wii, you can still do that.

316
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,003
Speaker 0: You can play Pac-Man vs.

317
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:17,388
Speaker 0: on the Wii.

318
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,087
Speaker 0: Oh boy.

319
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,170
Speaker 0: So, you know, I'll probably get an SP when they're like super mega cheap.

320
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,869
Speaker 1: But I gotta say, I'm really thinking about getting the DS Lite.

321
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:25,730
Speaker 0: Yeah.

322
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:26,910
Speaker 0: I don't know.

323
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:29,890
Speaker 0: If there's a really, really good trade-in deal.

324
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,308
Speaker 0: Like, if you give us your DS, we'll give you a DS Lite for 50 bucks.

325
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,268
Speaker 0: I'll do that.

326
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:40,050
Speaker 0: But if the trade-in deal's kind of shitty, like they don't give me enough for my DS, I'm gonna give them the finger.

327
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:43,570
Speaker 0: And then what I'll do is I'll wait for my DS to like die.

328
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,990
Speaker 0: And this, where the touchscreen is busted and the screens are starting to fade.

329
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:53,030
Speaker 0: Then I'll go and I'll just buy a DS Lite with cash and maybe give my DS to someone else.

330
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:56,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm really thinking of just buying a DS Lite, giving my DS to someone.

331
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,467
Speaker 1: Probably Emily if she wants it.

332
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you really just want a DS Lite and you really want to give a DS to Emily so you can play with her.

333
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,763
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

334
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,386
Speaker 1: Twofer.

335
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,121
Speaker 0: Yeah.

336
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,790
Speaker 1: The only drawback, and I don't want to harp on this because we've talked about it before, is the fact that the GBA slot is a little smaller.

337
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,870
Speaker 0: That really kind of makes me sad because I just bought the cool Rumble Pak and it's gonna stick out.

338
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,550
Speaker 1: The Rumble Pak is kind of dick.

339
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think if more games start to use it, I'm gonna want it.

340
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,317
Speaker 1: It is not a Rumble Pak.

341
00:18:23,378 --> 00:18:25,270
Speaker 1: It does not rumble in an effective manner.

342
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,870
Speaker 1: It does, however, act as a subwoofer.

343
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:34,030
Speaker 1: If you play Princess Peach and you put the Rumble Pak in, it uses it to make music and it's kind of cool.

344
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:35,829
Speaker 1: It's really loud too.

345
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,890
Speaker 0: I think that if more games start to use it, I'm gonna want to have it in there.

346
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,750
Speaker 0: But as it is right now, it's a give or take type of thing.

347
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,370
Speaker 1: I just like having the GBA game in there as kind of a backup game.

348
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's always good too.

349
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,209
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and, I don't know, Princess Peach, so I can switch it up.

350
00:18:53,370 --> 00:19:03,310
Speaker 0: But the other thing is that if maybe I'll get an SP when they're really cheap, then I'll use that because it's a little smaller and more comfortable to hold for that type of game than the DS is.

351
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the batteries last longer.

352
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:07,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they charge on the same wire.

353
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:14,070
Speaker 0: So maybe I'll get an SP for GBA in the old games and just use my DS for DS games only.

354
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:16,030
Speaker 1: Or, honestly, I might just buy a Micro.

355
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:18,408
Speaker 0: Oh, Micro, that's a good plan too.

356
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, because when Evan was up and we saw it, the Micro screen is really, really, really, really good.

357
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem with the Micro is that it only plays GBA games.

358
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,630
Speaker 0: It doesn't play the colors in the old games that I want to play.

359
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,729
Speaker 0: And it doesn't hook up so easily to the FFCCs and the...

360
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you get an SP, then I'll be fine with my Micro.

361
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,944
Speaker 0: That's true, that's true.

362
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,270
Speaker 0: Alright.

363
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,366
Speaker 0: So, let's go down the list of some of the DS games that we previously did not know about.

364
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:44,309
Speaker 0: that have been announced at E3.

365
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:49,730
Speaker 0: Most of these are gonna be Nintendo titles because that's the website I went to look at for the list.

366
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,670
Speaker 1: And those are the games we tend to care more about.

367
00:19:52,050 --> 00:20:01,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, if you look at the DS games that I bought, the only really great ones that aren't Nintendo licenses are like Phoenix Wright, which is Capcom, and such.

368
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,050
Speaker 0: And I don't think Capcom had their conference yet, did they?

369
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:06,630
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

370
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,011
Speaker 0: Maybe.

371
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:08,095
Speaker 0: I'll have to go tomorrow.

372
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:11,670
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go and look up and see what Capcom did and maybe I'll throw a news in tomorrow.

373
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:11,997
Speaker 0: Ah.

374
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:13,430
Speaker 0: Okay, ready?

375
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,975
Speaker 0: Chibi-Robo for the DS.

376
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:18,363
Speaker 0: I've heard good things about the GameCube game.

377
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,550
Speaker 0: I'm sure the DS game will be more of the same.

378
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,134
Speaker 0: I haven't played it yet.

379
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,081
Speaker 0: Maybe I will when it's ultra-cheap.

380
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,570
Speaker 0: I don't think that's gonna be a buy-at-full-price game.

381
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got nothing to say about that game.

382
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,733
Speaker 0: Children of Mana.

383
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:30,496
Speaker 0: Alright.

384
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:34,010
Speaker 0: There have been a couple of Mana games, I think, for the GBA, right?

385
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:36,418
Speaker 1: Uh, if there were, I didn't pick them up.

386
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,730
Speaker 1: I played the, uh, once in a game.

387
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:44,410
Speaker 0: Oh, I think there was one for the PlayStation 2 that was like Tree of Mana or something like that.

388
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,745
Speaker 1: The only ones I ever played were SNES.

389
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,399
Speaker 0: And then there was like Sword of Mana.

390
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:49,203
Speaker 0: is the original, right?

391
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:50,650
Speaker 0: No, Secret of Mana is the original.

392
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,500
Speaker 0: So there was like Sword and Tree.

393
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,064
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

394
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:53,790
Speaker 0: Don't quote me on that.

395
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,710
Speaker 1: For anyone who doesn't know, they're the games that are walk-around hit guys, kinda like Final Fantasy, but more like...

396
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,470
Speaker 0: It's between Final Fantasy and Zelda.

397
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:05,440
Speaker 0: But the original, the thing about it is the original.

398
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:08,410
Speaker 0: SNES allowed three players to play together.

399
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:10,389
Speaker 1: If you had that special thing.

400
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, two players could play together normally.

401
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,690
Speaker 0: And then the third person would just kinda hang off the edge.

402
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:22,430
Speaker 1: Which I'd actually never done this as a child, but now us and our friend Katsu have bit by bit been playing the game with the multiple player action.

403
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,820
Speaker 1: Also, uh, Final Fantasy Legend and Final Fantasy Adventure for the Game Boy.

404
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:30,010
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy Adventure games are the same games as this.

405
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:30,650
Speaker 1: Yeah.

406
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:34,570
Speaker 1: They just rebranded them because Americans, they figured the name Final Fantasy would sell.

407
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,294
Speaker 0: I think people know what Secret of Mana is.

408
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:41,630
Speaker 0: Anyway, a new game in the Secret of Mana series called Children of Mana is gonna be on the DS.

409
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:48,650
Speaker 0: And I normally wouldn't be interested in this, cause I'm not only semi-interested in the GBA one, and not at all interested in the Playstation one.

410
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:55,930
Speaker 0: But it's gonna have that simultaneous, cooperative multiplayer action that the original Secret of Mana had.

411
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,398
Speaker 0: Because the DS is all wireless.

412
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,987
Speaker 0: So now I'm all about this game.

413
00:21:59,008 --> 00:21:59,209
Speaker 1: Woo hoo!

414
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:02,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, because one, we've really been hurting for fun, cooperative games.

415
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:03,477
Speaker 0: Mhm.

416
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:12,130
Speaker 1: Two, I mean, games like that were fun on the consoles, except for the fact that you have one screen and multiple people who want to go in different directions, no matter what.

417
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:13,570
Speaker 1: Alright.

418
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,708
Speaker 1: The DS will allow that.

419
00:22:15,155 --> 00:22:15,328
Speaker 1: Yes.

420
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,110
Speaker 1: And it will be beautiful.

421
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:22,330
Speaker 0: There's gonna be something called Clubhouse Games, which looks like a bunch of card games like Rummy and Poker and all that stuff.

422
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:41,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever, but if it was- Cause most people who are like casual gamers on computers and such, they mostly play like little crap card games and chess and checkers and backgammon and all that crap.

423
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:47,130
Speaker 1: Plus, honestly, if a game like that were ten bucks and allowed download play, I might just pick it up and throw it in the bag.

424
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, that way even a doofus, you know, can pick it up, play, uh, maybe it's got hearts in it.

425
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:53,370
Speaker 0: That'd be worth it.

426
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:53,697
Speaker 1: Yeah.

427
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,107
Speaker 0: Hearts would be great on the DS.

428
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,730
Speaker 1: Especially since when I actually play hearts in person, we often forget to count the hearts.

429
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,248
Speaker 0: Yep.

430
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,548
Speaker 0: So, Custom Robo DS.

431
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,662
Speaker 1: I got Custom Robo- We disagree a little on this game.

432
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:06,630
Speaker 1: I say it's ass.

433
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:08,510
Speaker 0: It's not complete ass.

434
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:09,770
Speaker 1: It's mostly ass.

435
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,649
Speaker 0: It's mostly ass.

436
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:22,050
Speaker 0: Custom Robo is a game where there are a whole bunch of them in Japan, and from what I saw of them, especially the GBA version, it looked like an okay game where you customize a robot and then you fight in a kind of interesting combat.

437
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,129
Speaker 0: They finally brought out a GameCube Custom Robo, so I got it.

438
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:31,830
Speaker 0: It didn't live up to what I saw of the GBA one on the internet.

439
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,608
Speaker 1: The combat was just pretty poor.

440
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:41,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just, like, you customized your robot, and it was sort of a rock, paper, scissors, and whatever you chose, and everyone could see what you were choosing, and it wasn't so great.

441
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,330
Speaker 0: Not a lot of skill-based combat going on.

442
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,983
Speaker 1: And the single player, I still can't believe that you unlocked things in that game.

443
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,970
Speaker 1: I can't believe you played that horrible game.

444
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,710
Speaker 0: I played it all the way through once, I didn't play through the- you have to play through a second time to get the rest of the stuff.

445
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,530
Speaker 1: That game had some of the worst plot I've ever seen in a game.

446
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,826
Speaker 0: There wasn't- it's not much of a plot.

447
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:00,230
Speaker 0: Anyway.

448
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:11,690
Speaker 0: Custom Robo DS, I would get it if it looked more like the GBA stuff I remember seeing on the internet, but it looks pretty much just like the GameCube game, and the description is just like the GameCube game.

449
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:16,809
Speaker 0: Only the graphics are DS quality, so Custom Robo for DS, I'd avoid this.

450
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:20,567
Speaker 0: DK King of Swing DS.

451
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:26,830
Speaker 0: DK King of Swing was a GBA game where Donkey Kong would swing around doing stuff.

452
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,630
Speaker 0: I played it in a store for like a minute, and it was kind of boring and bleh.

453
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,090
Speaker 0: So I don't know why they're bringing out a DS version, maybe they can- Maybe it was- it must have been popular.

454
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:41,590
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll make it interesting because you'll swing DK using the stylus and all that.

455
00:24:43,872 --> 00:24:46,750
Speaker 0: But, um, I don't know why this game is cool.

456
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,229
Speaker 0: If anyone knows why DK King of Swing is a good game, tell me.

457
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,334
Speaker 0: DS Air.

458
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:57,670
Speaker 0: I didn't actually see anything about this until it went to this one page on the Nintendo website.

459
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,569
Speaker 1: This is the kind of game that we don't have yet on the DS.

460
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,608
Speaker 0: It looks like a real fighter jet flight sim for the DS.

461
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,409
Speaker 0: Like, oh, there's an F-16, look at it go.

462
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:13,290
Speaker 1: The last good fighter jet game I've played was this thing for my 486.

463
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:22,030
Speaker 0: I just- we'll have to see more of this game, because it could be really bad and terrible to control the jet, but it also could be really awesome where you dogfight your friends with wireless.

464
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,247
Speaker 1: Well, there's also those, uh, flight games that Katsu always talks about for the PlayStation 2.

465
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:27,970
Speaker 1: I kind of want to pick up.

466
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, those seem like one-player kind of bleh games to me.

467
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:32,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, they look fun, though.

468
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:36,030
Speaker 1: I want a game where I can fly a fighter jet, I haven't had a game like that in a long time.

469
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:38,770
Speaker 0: Microsoft Flight Simulator we'll talk about later.

470
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, fuck you.

471
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,016
Speaker 0: Um, Elite Beat Agents.

472
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:51,749
Speaker 0: This looks like a beat kind of DDR game, but instead of dancing with your feet or anything, you kind of do the beat with the stylus.

473
00:25:52,730 --> 00:26:00,530
Speaker 0: And from what I saw in the pictures, it was like, draw a circle, you know, move around to different positions on the beats, etc.

474
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:03,823
Speaker 0: So, it's like DDR for your stylus.

475
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:05,030
Speaker 0: It might be cool.

476
00:26:05,492 --> 00:26:06,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll have to see it.

477
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:09,109
Speaker 1: I'll definitely play it in a store before I actually play it.

478
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:11,178
Speaker 0: Alright, here's a really good game.

479
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,230
Speaker 0: Hotel Dusk Room 215.

480
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,509
Speaker 1: Alright, this game gives me the Phoenix Wright vibe.

481
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:23,668
Speaker 0: I saw the screenshots of this game and I said, "That's Phoenix Wright plus Deja Vu plus Pandora Directive Tex

482
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:23,949
Speaker 0: Murphy.".

483
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:34,130
Speaker 1: I think they've realized that, because for anyone who isn't aware, games like Phoenix Wright, you know, the very text-heavy adventure games, is a genre of gaming that's huge in Japan.

484
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:34,669
Speaker 0: Huge.

485
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,609
Speaker 1: And never really made it over here.

486
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,167
Speaker 0: Not at all.

487
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,350
Speaker 1: Even though there were hundreds of them, like for Nintendo and Super Nintendo and computer.

488
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:55,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, these kind of adventure games are mostly, there's a bunch of text telling you a story, and you either have to solve a puzzle to continue and get the rest of the story, or you can slightly choose your own adventure a little bit and get the rest of the story.

489
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,210
Speaker 0: And that, the choose your own adventure ones are a little better because that way you play it multiple times to get all the endings.

490
00:27:01,491 --> 00:27:04,630
Speaker 1: Yep, some of them are really, really advanced with crazy branching stories.

491
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,645
Speaker 0: Some of them have puzzles and choose your own adventure.

492
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:07,310
Speaker 0: Those are the best ones.

493
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,730
Speaker 0: This, I can't tell, but it looks like it has some puzzling.

494
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,908
Speaker 0: And all the characters look like someone drew them in a manga and then cut them out with a scissor.

495
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:18,329
Speaker 0: Which is really cool.

496
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,250
Speaker 1: I think they've realized, I mean Phoenix Wright was kind of a risk.

497
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,090
Speaker 1: No one really knew how the American market would end.

498
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:25,549
Speaker 0: Everyone knew that was gonna, I knew.

499
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,857
Speaker 1: Well, no one in the industry knew.

500
00:27:26,918 --> 00:27:28,728
Speaker 1: They were like, "Will people play games like

501
00:27:28,768 --> 00:27:28,929
Speaker 1: this?".

502
00:27:29,193 --> 00:27:29,628
Speaker 0: Hells yes.

503
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:37,690
Speaker 1: Well, considering that Phoenix Wright sold out and was re-released, I have a feeling that this game is going to be the start of a torrent of similar games.

504
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:38,507
Speaker 0: Indeed.

505
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:45,890
Speaker 0: So, this game looks like Phoenix Wright, but maybe a little better, maybe a little worse, a little more serious.

506
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,690
Speaker 1: Looks a lot of detective action.

507
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:54,250
Speaker 0: I'll probably pick it up right away because it probably disappeared just like Phoenix Wright did and I don't want to risk not having it.

508
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:54,690
Speaker 0: Yeah.

509
00:27:55,332 --> 00:27:56,447
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a Kirby DS.

510
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,869
Speaker 0: There's already a Canvas Curse, we know.

511
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,670
Speaker 0: This is not a Canvas Curse.

512
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,330
Speaker 0: This looks like a real Kirby game, like Kirby's Adventure and Kirby's Dream Land.

513
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:08,750
Speaker 0: I didn't like the Kirby Magic Mirror for the GBA.

514
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,869
Speaker 0: It was too non-linear and hard to figure out what the hell to do.

515
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,030
Speaker 0: Hopefully this one isn't like that.

516
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,630
Speaker 0: It's more, hopefully it's more like Kirby's Adventure, which is the best Kirby game ever.

517
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really have to agree on that.

518
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:21,370
Speaker 1: I was playing it the other day.

519
00:28:21,711 --> 00:28:22,730
Speaker 0: You were playing Kirby's Adventure?

520
00:28:22,971 --> 00:28:23,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, on my computer.

521
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:24,430
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

522
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,021
Speaker 0: Yeah.

523
00:28:25,391 --> 00:28:25,715
Speaker 0: Awesome.

524
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:26,810
Speaker 0: Kirby's Adventure rules.

525
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,550
Speaker 0: If you haven't played Kirby's Adventure for the NES, you gots to play that.

526
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:37,370
Speaker 0: If you don't have an emulator or whatever, you can get Kirby Something Nightmare for the GBA.

527
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,130
Speaker 0: It's the exact same game, pretty much.

528
00:28:39,611 --> 00:28:40,207
Speaker 0: So, get that.

529
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,209
Speaker 0: Legend of Zelda Phantom Hour class.

530
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:45,361
Speaker 1: Oh, I think we talked about it already.

531
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:46,710
Speaker 1: At least mention that it's coming out.

532
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:48,562
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty obvious.

533
00:28:48,663 --> 00:28:49,289
Speaker 0: Everyone buy it.

534
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:49,782
Speaker 1: Yeah.

535
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:54,650
Speaker 1: Even though the Minish Cap was kind of blah, I don't think this will be that.

536
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,522
Speaker 0: This won't be that.

537
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:02,190
Speaker 0: Because even if it's blah, like Minish Cap, it's going to have the touch screen action, which makes it all good.

538
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:03,090
Speaker 1: Usually.

539
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,156
Speaker 0: Solving Zelda puzzles with a touch screen.

540
00:29:05,216 --> 00:29:08,227
Speaker 0: You can give me one touch screen Zelda puzzle and I'm set.

541
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:08,990
Speaker 0: I'll give you 30 bucks.

542
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,922
Speaker 0: An RPG named Magical Vacation.

543
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:15,149
Speaker 0: I don't know what to say about it.

544
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:16,528
Speaker 0: It's an RPG.

545
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:17,368
Speaker 1: Great.

546
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:22,825
Speaker 0: I think it might have some sort of multiplayer something, but I don't know.

547
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:24,310
Speaker 0: There wasn't enough information about it.

548
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,568
Speaker 1: Of course RPGs, we do know that on the GBA we're getting Final Fantasy V and VI.

549
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:30,948
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep.

550
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:32,609
Speaker 1: I'm kind of excited.

551
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:33,664
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep.

552
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,536
Speaker 1: Because Final Fantasy IV for the GBA was great.

553
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:41,790
Speaker 1: It let me play through the game of my childhood without the annoyance of playing through the game of my childhood exactly as it was.

554
00:29:42,111 --> 00:29:44,430
Speaker 0: I'll let you buy all those and then I'll play them as I want.

555
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:44,896
Speaker 1: Yep.

556
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:46,809
Speaker 0: Goddamn monitor keeps turning off.

557
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,260
Speaker 0: Alright, you might know of this Flash game you can play on the internet called Zuma.

558
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:53,443
Speaker 0: It's kind of popular.

559
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:56,130
Speaker 0: A lot of people pay for it and have it on their cell phones.

560
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,350
Speaker 0: It's been quite profitable for everyone who's been involved in it.

561
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,529
Speaker 1: I'd actually never heard of it.

562
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,197
Speaker 0: I only played it once when it came out and then I saw people playing it around.

563
00:30:05,257 --> 00:30:13,710
Speaker 0: It's, you know, nowadays these casual little tiny games that you put on a Flash website and you charge people like 5 bucks for a real download.

564
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:16,550
Speaker 0: Like that Diner Dash, they made a bunch of money off that.

565
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:17,050
Speaker 1: Yep.

566
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,836
Speaker 0: You know, and all those sorts of things.

567
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:20,705
Speaker 0: There's a lot of money in that business.

568
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:21,570
Speaker 0: Cell phone games.

569
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:28,466
Speaker 0: Zuma is one that kind of hit it big where these balls go in a spiral and you kind of grab the balls and match up the colors.

570
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,170
Speaker 0: I'm not exactly sure how it's played.

571
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:32,650
Speaker 1: In terms of gameplay, I don't like these games.

572
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,790
Speaker 0: I don't like these games so much either.

573
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:40,230
Speaker 1: They're very much not a matter of skill so much as a matter of once you know how to play you can pretty much keep playing forever.

574
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,398
Speaker 0: Well the games are, they serve the same role as Sudoku does.

575
00:30:43,538 --> 00:30:48,150
Speaker 0: It's just busy work, you know, for mindless people to do with their hands.

576
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:48,471
Speaker 1: Yup.

577
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:49,730
Speaker 1: Occupy your mind and kill time.

578
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:50,429
Speaker 1: Exactly.

579
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,610
Speaker 1: You mustn't kill time, boy.

580
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:56,666
Speaker 0: So they're going to put out Zuma for the DS but they're not calling it Zuma probably because they don't want to get sued.

581
00:30:56,886 --> 00:30:58,110
Speaker 0: They're calling it Magnetica.

582
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,135
Speaker 0: And you'll probably be able to control the game with a touch screen.

583
00:31:01,155 --> 00:31:08,190
Speaker 0: This is another game that all the people who buy brain training and clubhouse games can get on.

584
00:31:08,553 --> 00:31:10,028
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a game to buy your mommy.

585
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:10,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

586
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:12,517
Speaker 0: Next to her Nintendogs.

587
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:15,489
Speaker 0: Mario 3 on 3 Basketball DS.

588
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:20,270
Speaker 1: I saw some bits about this and I'm really excited.

589
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:24,685
Speaker 0: Like, I said like, I don't like basketball games.

590
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:26,190
Speaker 0: Well I like NBA Jam.

591
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,310
Speaker 1: I never even liked NBA Jam.

592
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,323
Speaker 0: Oh I love NBA Jam Tournament Edition for the Sega Genesis.

593
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:32,650
Speaker 0: That was a good basketball game.

594
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,175
Speaker 0: Double Dribble was a good basketball game.

595
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:39,426
Speaker 0: Every other basketball game except maybe Jordan vs.

596
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:40,849
Speaker 0: Bird but I don't know about that.

597
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:47,185
Speaker 0: But every other basketball game, not good.

598
00:31:47,587 --> 00:31:48,490
Speaker 0: Very not good.

599
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:56,470
Speaker 1: I mean all the new basketball games really seem to go for the "look how realistically we emulated the sweat on this player that you're supposed to know is named

600
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:56,590
Speaker 1: Space.".

601
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,983
Speaker 0: We have all the right tattoos and all the right players.

602
00:31:59,023 --> 00:32:00,008
Speaker 0: We're so hip-hoppin'.

603
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

604
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:02,089
Speaker 1: Not much game there.

605
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:05,957
Speaker 0: This looks like it could be a really fun Mario sports game.

606
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:11,689
Speaker 0: If we learned anything from Mario Soccer which we still have to get but it's still 50 bucks and it's only worth about 35 bucks.

607
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,029
Speaker 1: Well there's a reason it's still 50 bucks.

608
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:14,650
Speaker 0: Yeah.

609
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:21,890
Speaker 0: And if we learned anything from Mario Tennis and Mario Baseball and Mario Golf, Mario 3 on 3 Basketball is going to be a good time.

610
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,562
Speaker 0: Six people with DS's playing basketball.

611
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:25,869
Speaker 0: This is going to be good stuff.

612
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:39,030
Speaker 1: Because all these games, it's like they take a sports game, the sport itself, but they abstract it to where you can play it in a fun way like as a video game but it's still recognizable as the sport.

613
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:45,950
Speaker 1: As opposed to the EA sports games which try to emulate the sport as perfectly as possible which usually makes a really shitty game.

614
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:52,061
Speaker 0: Okay, Mario vs Donkey Kong 2.

615
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:56,650
Speaker 0: I don't know if anyone else played Mario vs Donkey Kong but let me just tell the story of this game real quick.

616
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:57,909
Speaker 1: I actually have never played it.

617
00:32:58,111 --> 00:32:58,539
Speaker 0: I have.

618
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,028
Speaker 0: I'll give it to you.

619
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,892
Speaker 1: Have you ever played Donkey Kong 3?

620
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the one where you use the bug spray.

621
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:04,915
Speaker 1: Yeah.

622
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:06,210
Speaker 1: Right up Donkey Kong's ass.

623
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,196
Speaker 0: That's correct.

624
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,750
Speaker 0: You make him climb up those bamboo sticks.

625
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:17,830
Speaker 0: Okay, back in the day for the Game Boy, the Game Boy, the Game Boy, there was a game called Donkey Kong.

626
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,690
Speaker 0: This was not just a replica of the original Donkey Kong.

627
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:37,970
Speaker 0: What it was, was you played the original Donkey Kong and after that there was this other game which involved Mario trying to navigate these dangerous levels to get a key and put it in a door and eventually at the end you got Donkey Kong.

628
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:47,930
Speaker 0: I don't know if I've ever played it all the way through but there were these complex puzzle platformers where it wasn't just, you know, like Mario Bros.

629
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,810
Speaker 0: You have to run fast, don't get hit by bad guys, don't fall in holes, and collect coins.

630
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,690
Speaker 0: It was, you know, solve the puzzle in order to get Mario through.

631
00:33:58,271 --> 00:34:08,230
Speaker 0: You were still platforming walking and jumping and climbing ladders but you had to really think about how to get to the other side of the level by pushing blocks and all that sort of stuff.

632
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,455
Speaker 0: They brought back this concept only recently with the game called Mario vs.

633
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:27,130
Speaker 0: Donkey Kong on the GBA where Mario has to navigate these dangerous levels in a platform puzzler and collect these present boxes and get a key and open a door.

634
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:37,989
Speaker 0: And then every few levels he has to get these mini Marios to follow him around the level and get them into like a treasure chest which is another difficult type of puzzle.

635
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:45,150
Speaker 0: And then after that Mario has to fight a boss which is another difficult type of puzzle but it's also mostly platforming with the bosses.

636
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,678
Speaker 0: This is gonna be, the first Mario vs.

637
00:34:48,717 --> 00:34:53,310
Speaker 0: DK on the GBA was kind of fun and I wasn't sad for paying money for it.

638
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:54,911
Speaker 0: So if Mario vs.

639
00:34:54,972 --> 00:35:04,610
Speaker 0: DK 2 for the DS can incorporate enough touchscreen awesome action to make the puzzles more fun or more difficult and interesting.

640
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:10,330
Speaker 0: And if it has enough puzzles, because this could be a game where it's really good but it's too short and it's not worth the money.

641
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:16,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of like Princess Peach which I really liked but now I'm at the end of the game and I'm just, I have no desire to beat it.

642
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if this game is long enough it'll be worth your money to pay for it.

643
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:25,870
Speaker 0: If it's not long enough, just get the Game Boy 1 used and then get this one used a few years later.

644
00:35:28,032 --> 00:35:30,790
Speaker 0: New Super Mario Brothers, we'll talk about that in two weeks when we get it.

645
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, we all know this game is going to be awesome.

646
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:40,190
Speaker 1: I mean, right before E3 it's like there was no video game news except they kept releasing little bits about this game.

647
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:46,210
Speaker 0: On the official website they were releasing a video every few days and every time they released a video it got on dig.

648
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,456
Speaker 0: So, this game is going to be insane.

649
00:35:49,537 --> 00:35:55,250
Speaker 0: I don't think you'll need to pre-order it but I do suggest you head over to your local game store on Tuesday or Wednesday.

650
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,310
Speaker 0: So a week from now and just grab this game the day it comes out or you'll be sorry.

651
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:03,963
Speaker 1: Now all told, the DS was exploding for a while.

652
00:36:04,404 --> 00:36:05,970
Speaker 1: It's like double exploding now.

653
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, listen to all the things we're saying here.

654
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,129
Speaker 0: Look at all these DS games coming out.

655
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:16,370
Speaker 0: Whatever we're going to say about their other three major consoles, the PSP is dead and the DS is the king, holy crap.

656
00:36:17,273 --> 00:36:19,190
Speaker 0: The PSP is dead as a gaming system really.

657
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a cool little piece of technology and we're really not trying to disparage our-.

658
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,629
Speaker 0: We'll still talk, there's some things to say about it.

659
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:27,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, not much.

660
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:27,871
Speaker 0: Not much.

661
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:28,713
Speaker 0: Okay.

662
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:31,740
Speaker 0: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue and Red.

663
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:36,370
Speaker 0: This looks like it's going to be a real Pokemon game which we haven't had in a while.

664
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,570
Speaker 1: So not just some sort of Pokemon puzzle bullshit?

665
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,950
Speaker 0: No, it's actually going to be a Pokemon RPG from the looks of it.

666
00:36:42,311 --> 00:36:45,310
Speaker 1: I'm kind of curious because I've never actually played a Pokemon game.

667
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,590
Speaker 0: I'll give you Pokemon Red but you need to play it on a non-DS because it's a Game Boy game.

668
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:51,089
Speaker 1: I got my GBA.

669
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:51,551
Speaker 1: Alright.

670
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:58,450
Speaker 0: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue is going to be a DS game and Red is going to be a GBA game.

671
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,470
Speaker 0: So that's going to be kind of interesting.

672
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,190
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's going to be some sort of, if you have them both in a DS, something happens.

673
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,330
Speaker 0: I'm almost positive that there's something going to happen trying to sell people both games.

674
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:10,275
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

675
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:12,410
Speaker 0: If I was going to get it, I would only get the blue one.

676
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:24,710
Speaker 0: But the point of this is that unlike the other previous Pokemon RPGs where you were a trainer and you collected Pokemon, in this one the plot seems to be that you were turned into a Pokemon.

677
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,110
Speaker 0: So now you're a Pokemon training other Pokemon but also yourself.

678
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:30,450
Speaker 0: So that should be interesting.

679
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,570
Speaker 0: There's also going to be a DS game called Pokemon Ranger.

680
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,110
Speaker 0: There isn't a lot of information about it but just screenshots.

681
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:41,069
Speaker 0: It looks like it's going to be Pokemon Stadium DS which is kind of bleh.

682
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:42,968
Speaker 0: Alright, you ready bitches?

683
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,808
Speaker 0: Motherfucking Star Fox DS.

684
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:46,615
Speaker 1: Woo!

685
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:50,109
Speaker 1: I'm all about that.

686
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,849
Speaker 0: I'm going to be flying my Arwing straight up your ass.

687
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,249
Speaker 1: Man, I remember when Star Fox came out for the SNES.

688
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,110
Speaker 0: That was fantastic.

689
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,570
Speaker 1: They kept hyping up how it was a new technological blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

690
00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:07,608
Speaker 0: And whether you remember it or not, Star Fox 64 was the game that unveiled the Rumble Pak for the N64.

691
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:12,530
Speaker 0: And the multiplayer in that was nothing short of awesome.

692
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:17,930
Speaker 0: But Star Fox Adventure and Assault for the Gamecube have been moderately disappointing.

693
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,670
Speaker 0: Especially when compared to Star Fox 64 which is holy crap.

694
00:38:22,931 --> 00:38:29,770
Speaker 0: So here's hoping that Star Fox DS brings back the Star Fox 64 and the SNES Star Fox that we once knew.

695
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:35,970
Speaker 1: I envision, I mean we don't know, but I envision various multiplayer co-op or competitive wireless actions.

696
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,610
Speaker 0: Oh if it has co-op, that's god damn.

697
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:41,750
Speaker 0: Four people trying to beat, oh that would be so great.

698
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,368
Speaker 1: If it can be me and my crew with women.

699
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,870
Speaker 0: Hey Nintendo people listening, co-op Star Fox.

700
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:47,627
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd buy it.

701
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:48,488
Speaker 0: I'd buy it.

702
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,589
Speaker 1: We'd all buy it.

703
00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:52,830
Speaker 0: Alright, you know that Tenchu Ninja whatever game?

704
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,249
Speaker 0: They're making a DS one, it looks kind of bleh.

705
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,630
Speaker 0: Yoshi's Island 2.

706
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:03,990
Speaker 0: They brought out every Mario game, well they brought out Mario 1, Super Mario Brothers.

707
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:06,750
Speaker 0: Mario Brothers, non-super.

708
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:10,350
Speaker 0: And the lost levels for the Game Boy Color.

709
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:16,070
Speaker 0: Then on the Game Boy Advance they brought out Doki Doki Panic Mario 2 USA.

710
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:19,510
Speaker 0: Mario 3, Mario World, and Yoshi's Island.

711
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:21,350
Speaker 1: I still gotta get that Mario 3.

712
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,751
Speaker 0: I gotta get that Mario 3.

713
00:39:23,751 --> 00:39:28,311
Speaker 0: So now on the DS they're bringing out the one missing game, Yoshi's Island 2.

714
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:28,503
Speaker 0: Hooray.

715
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,809
Speaker 0: A lot of people seem to be really happy about that.

716
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,286
Speaker 1: Yup.

717
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:39,730
Speaker 0: A lot of people seem to like Yoshi's Island, I never played it that much, but supposedly some people consider Yoshi's Island to be like this amazing platformer of all time.

718
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:42,930
Speaker 0: I think I have to play it more to see what they're talking about.

719
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:45,110
Speaker 0: I've only played like the first few levels.

720
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,410
Speaker 1: I doubt it's better than Mario 3.

721
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,169
Speaker 0: Or Mario World.

722
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:50,363
Speaker 0: But it seems like it's just Mario World.

723
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:51,270
Speaker 0: but you can throw eggs.

724
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,410
Speaker 0: I gotta get to the later levels to see if there's anything I'm missing.

725
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,569
Speaker 0: And I'll play Yoshi's Island 2 to see what's up.

726
00:39:57,971 --> 00:39:59,309
Speaker 0: And last on my DS list.

727
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:01,123
Speaker 0: FFCCDS.

728
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:02,510
Speaker 1: Alright.

729
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:12,290
Speaker 1: Now I know we've told the story, but Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles was an amazing game that we played straight through start to finish over the course of a weekend.

730
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:19,050
Speaker 0: It seems that the original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for the GameCube suffered because of its Game Boy Connection thing.

731
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:28,531
Speaker 0: Now I thought the Game Boy Connection thing was really cool, but apparently all the people complaining about, "Oh man I don't want to have to have four GBAs and four friends and all that,".

732
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:32,489
Speaker 0: even though everyone should have had a GBA already, that kind of won out.

733
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:39,010
Speaker 0: And very rarely were people able to get four people to actually play this entire game.

734
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:44,189
Speaker 1: However, if you could pull it off, that was one of the defining gaming experiences of my life.

735
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:44,929
Speaker 0: Yeah.

736
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:48,810
Speaker 1: I put that right up there with the first time I beat Zelda 2.

737
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:54,170
Speaker 0: So because of that, we'll probably do the same thing with the FFCCDS and the FFCC Wii.

738
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:11,270
Speaker 1: FFCC on the DS has one big advantage, because the GameCube, the connector for the GBA to be connected to the GameCube was nice, but it was slow, a little high latency, it couldn't really do the high powered awesome things you'd want.

739
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,830
Speaker 1: It was more like a proof of concept.

740
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you couldn't look at the GBA screen and the real screen at the same time.

741
00:41:16,748 --> 00:41:17,150
Speaker 0: so much.

742
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:19,029
Speaker 0: You're either looking down or looking up.

743
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,269
Speaker 1: And you were really limited by the fact that all the main gameplay was still on the TV.

744
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:28,209
Speaker 1: It was hard to hide big things from other players or do interesting things like that.

745
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:30,690
Speaker 1: The DS removes all those limitations.

746
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:37,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got two screens right in front of your face, the main gameplay is on the top screen and your inventory and stuff is on the bottom, and woah.

747
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:49,188
Speaker 1: I mean, imagine this, we don't know exactly what the game will be like, but the only reason they had the buskit in FFCC originally was that the players can't stray from each other or the game doesn't work.

748
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:53,030
Speaker 1: There's no need for that in the DS version.

749
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:56,650
Speaker 0: Yep, and considering the plot, there shouldn't be a need for that.

750
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:07,590
Speaker 1: Now they might have some sort of thing like that anyway for various gameplay reasons, but the fact remains that you'll be able to, technologically at least, have multiple players in multiple places simultaneously.

751
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:15,209
Speaker 1: Of course, that's the same thing about the four swords that may come for DS's and the sort of mana things that'll come out.

752
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,429
Speaker 0: Yep.

753
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:21,488
Speaker 0: So, that's the DS rundown, or at least the Geek Knight's DS rundown from E3.

754
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:29,182
Speaker 1: So, the conclusion here, the moral of the DS bit is that the DS is exploding and awesome in Nintendo++.

755
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:34,346
Speaker 0: If you don't have a DS right now, I recommend you buy a DS Lite on June 11th.

756
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,066
Speaker 1: Or hell, you can get a used regular DS now for like 70 bucks.

757
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:40,109
Speaker 0: If you're cheap, go for that one.

758
00:42:40,631 --> 00:42:40,965
Speaker 0: Hells yeah.

759
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:43,970
Speaker 0: But, uh, that's how it's gonna play out.

760
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:50,988
Speaker 0: If you don't have a DS and you go to a convention or a LAN party or anything, all those people with DS's, man, whatcha gonna do?

761
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,369
Speaker 1: I can't wait to load a con.

762
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:53,250
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

763
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,690
Speaker 0: It's gonna be insane.

764
00:42:55,393 --> 00:42:55,507
Speaker 1: Okay.

765
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,330
Speaker 1: Alright, let's take a break from Nintendo for a bit.

766
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,508
Speaker 1: We'll be back about the Wii.

767
00:43:00,354 --> 00:43:00,810
Speaker 1: The Wii-volution.

768
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:01,849
Speaker 0: But we're gonna take a break.

769
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,210
Speaker 0: You won't notice because it'll just be a skip in the audio or whatever.

770
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:11,090
Speaker 0: Okay, now let's hear from our good friends at Sony.

771
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:15,982
Speaker 1: Now, the Sony abortion of a press conference release.

772
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:19,110
Speaker 1: whatnot, god we keep saying whatnot, happened yesterday.

773
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:25,970
Speaker 1: It is probably well known that Sony did not really overwhelm anyone with their offerings.

774
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:36,190
Speaker 0: I think every single video game magazine, video game blog, editor, writer, everywhere, the number one word they were using was underwhelming.

775
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:41,390
Speaker 1: Yes, I saw the word "tepid response" in more than one report.

776
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:46,990
Speaker 0: So this isn't, don't say "oh you Nintendo fanboys" even though we are sort of Nintendo fanboys kinda.

777
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:55,024
Speaker 1: Sony fanboys, Sony fanboys at the Sony thing who have been waiting for this since they first heard that there was gonna be a PS3.

778
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,270
Speaker 1: When a PS3 was a glimmer in some executive's eye.

779
00:43:59,311 --> 00:44:01,770
Speaker 1: They were there and they didn't even clap.

780
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:08,910
Speaker 0: Now we're not saying there aren't any Sony fanboys who are all about this because there are plenty who are all about this.

781
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:19,028
Speaker 0: We're just saying that the general mood of the marketplace and the media, gaming media seems to be "oh bleh".

782
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:24,009
Speaker 1: Non-gaming media was even "bleh" about this.

783
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:29,030
Speaker 1: Media that don't know anything about the gaming market and were just reporting on what Sony's doing because they're a company.

784
00:44:29,392 --> 00:44:32,310
Speaker 0: Now when it comes, let's first talk about the clapping.

785
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:40,350
Speaker 1: Alright, so Sony comes out and they're like "here's all our stuff" and they unveil little bits and they show little preview things.

786
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,349
Speaker 1: But mostly they just talk numbers.

787
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,810
Speaker 1: Numbers that gamers don't care about.

788
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,330
Speaker 0: And when Sony talks about numbers, they always talk about shipments.

789
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:50,570
Speaker 0: They don't talk about sales, they talk about shipments.

790
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:55,389
Speaker 1: They're like "we've shipped XPSPs and we've shipped XPS2s blah blah blah".

791
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:59,690
Speaker 1: And they've shipped a lot of PSPs, but they haven't sold a lot of them.

792
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:09,689
Speaker 0: I'd like to point out that at the Sony conference, if you watch it or look at pictures of it, there's this giant screen with what is obviously a powerpoint.

793
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:11,769
Speaker 1: And they've just got numbers.

794
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:15,650
Speaker 0: A lot of numbers and a lot of bullet points and it's kind of bleh.

795
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:22,450
Speaker 0: At the Nintendo thing, they had the freaking giant Nintendo logo with the lights behind it that was always there.

796
00:45:22,571 --> 00:45:25,310
Speaker 1: They had the freaking Miyamoto conducting that orchestra.

797
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're learning from Apple.

798
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,390
Speaker 0: Sony is still doing their boring old businessman show.

799
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,643
Speaker 0: Even Microsoft put on a better show.

800
00:45:33,683 --> 00:45:34,629
Speaker 0: Microsoft's show's pretty good.

801
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:42,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I don't see myself buying an Xbox 360 anytime soon, but Microsoft, I'm kind of impressed with the Xbox 360 in general.

802
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm kind of interested in some of the stuff they're offering.

803
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:51,709
Speaker 0: The Sony, I can understand their business strategies and such, but a company with a hundred...

804
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:57,750
Speaker 1: Alright, Scott, understanding Sony's business practices is like understanding why a crazy guy keeps hitting himself in the head with a hammer.

805
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:58,609
Speaker 0: 'Cause he's crazy.

806
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,890
Speaker 0: Okay, so, let's, uh, where can we start with Sony?

807
00:46:03,071 --> 00:46:04,384
Speaker 1: Well, we'll keep going with the clapping here.

808
00:46:04,405 --> 00:46:04,950
Speaker 1: It's a nice thread.

809
00:46:05,032 --> 00:46:05,408
Speaker 0: Alright, alright.

810
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:10,952
Speaker 1: So then, they announced the price point of the PlayStation 3.

811
00:46:10,952 --> 00:46:15,710
Speaker 1: And for anyone who doesn't know, it is $600.

812
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:16,152
Speaker 0: It's $600?

813
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:18,683
Speaker 0: Alright, there are two different PS3s that you can buy.

814
00:46:21,831 --> 00:46:26,810
Speaker 0: One of the PS3s is $600, and one of them is $500.

815
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:31,650
Speaker 0: Now, the $600 one has a 60 gig hard drive and has everything.

816
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:34,721
Speaker 0: The 20 gig hard, the $500 one only has a 20 gig hard drive.

817
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,481
Speaker 0: I guess maybe that doesn't make a big difference.

818
00:46:38,622 --> 00:46:39,950
Speaker 0: It might if you have a lot of games, I don't know.

819
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:42,264
Speaker 1: Well, considering that a Blu-Ray disc can hold like 35 gigabytes.

820
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this isn't such a big, whatever.

821
00:46:45,952 --> 00:46:53,410
Speaker 0: The 20 gig one, the other problem with it is that it does not have a slot to put in flash cards.

822
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:57,770
Speaker 0: Like SD flash, you know, memory sticks, etc.

823
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:02,150
Speaker 0: That's a fucker, because how are you supposed to integrate it with your PSP and shit?

824
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:05,310
Speaker 1: It's also missing the HDMI port.

825
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,130
Speaker 0: It doesn't have the HDMI port, and it doesn't have a wireless card.

826
00:47:10,254 --> 00:47:11,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically...

827
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:14,506
Speaker 0: So you have to plug it in with an ethernet cable if you don't buy the $600 one.

828
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:20,345
Speaker 1: I can't see anyone buying the $500 one, except for people who are so poor.

829
00:47:20,385 --> 00:47:23,906
Speaker 1: they can't afford a PS3, but they just have enough money to buy the $500 one.

830
00:47:25,371 --> 00:47:27,010
Speaker 1: It doesn't even look like it's going to be upgradeable.

831
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:41,888
Speaker 0: And I want to talk about the Engadget, what they said, and I think it rings pretty true, is they said if the freehand Wii controller is Nintendo's selling point on the Wii, then the HD is the selling point on the PS3.

832
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:54,730
Speaker 0: And if the cheaper $500 one doesn't have the HDMI port, it's like if they had two different versions of the Wii and one of them just came with GameCube controllers.

833
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,050
Speaker 1: I gotta hand it to Sony.

834
00:47:57,813 --> 00:48:01,950
Speaker 1: When they announced this, it made the Xbox 360 look affordable to me.

835
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:03,630
Speaker 1: It made it look reasonable.

836
00:48:04,212 --> 00:48:05,448
Speaker 0: And it made it look pretty good, too.

837
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:12,270
Speaker 1: So I think, hey, for $400, I can get a badass Xbox 360, and there's some games I'm actually kind of interested in now.

838
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:16,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, and when we talk about the Xbox 360, you'll see they got a lot of new stuff in the line.

839
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:18,978
Speaker 0: that makes me go, "Huh, maybe this isn't all ass.

840
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,987
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll maybe move into that

841
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:21,328
Speaker 0: area.".

842
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:32,590
Speaker 1: Well, honestly, I'm thinking that the Xbox 360, not now, but within a year, I could see myself buying one at a slight discount, maybe a used one, or the streamlined re-release they're going to have.

843
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:33,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

844
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:44,064
Speaker 1: Not only is the PlayStation 3, the real one, $600, because we're not going to talk about the GIMP version, it's 600 euros in Europe.

845
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:54,726
Speaker 0: So usually, because euros are worth more than dollars, and pounds are worth a lot more than dollars, like one pound is like $1.60-something.

846
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:55,490
Speaker 0: It's a lot of money.

847
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:06,050
Speaker 1: Well, honestly, there's a bunch of extra news about that because I don't want to get off on a tangent, but China and Asia in general have for a long time said, "Eh, we might not peg the yuan to the dollar anymore.

848
00:49:06,532 --> 00:49:06,995
Speaker 1: What are you going to

849
00:49:07,035 --> 00:49:07,237
Speaker 1: do?".

850
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,969
Speaker 1: But no, everyone knew they wouldn't.

851
00:49:09,731 --> 00:49:14,470
Speaker 1: Now it looks like they're really going to do it, so the dollar's been dropping, more so than usual.

852
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:15,112
Speaker 0: Good.

853
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,266
Speaker 0: I've been waiting for them to unpeg it.

854
00:49:17,286 --> 00:49:17,870
Speaker 0: That's what I want.

855
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:22,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it'll be good for everyone in the world, except, uh, Americans.

856
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:22,871
Speaker 0: Woohoo!

857
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:32,078
Speaker 0: Alright, so... You know, they're pretty big on the PS3.

858
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,310
Speaker 0: That's the system in many other parts of the world, this PlayStation.

859
00:49:35,852 --> 00:49:37,585
Speaker 0: They're really big on Nintendo in Europe.

860
00:49:37,827 --> 00:49:38,209
Speaker 0: so much.

861
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:39,749
Speaker 1: Though I think they will be now.

862
00:49:40,451 --> 00:49:41,062
Speaker 0: They might be.

863
00:49:41,082 --> 00:49:41,490
Speaker 0: We'll see.

864
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,740
Speaker 1: It costs the equivalent of almost $800 for the PS3 in Europe.

865
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:56,530
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that Europe and the rest of the world outside of Japan and the US and North America and places is going to be real big on the Xbox, and I'll explain why in a little bit.

866
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,944
Speaker 1: $800 fucking dollars for the cost.

867
00:50:00,024 --> 00:50:00,928
Speaker 1: Well, here, look at the $600 figure.

868
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:08,629
Speaker 1: For the cost of the PS3, I could probably buy a Revolution Wii, a Wiivolution, you know.

869
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:13,810
Speaker 1: Another one for my other kid, if I had a kid, so the two kids wouldn't fight over it.

870
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:14,658
Speaker 0: And how many DS's?

871
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,528
Speaker 0: Like, how many DS lights?

872
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,375
Speaker 1: Oh, God, 20 PS.

873
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,710
Speaker 1: Or you could buy one Revolution and, like, eight or nine games for it.

874
00:50:22,073 --> 00:50:22,456
Speaker 0: Yeah.

875
00:50:23,122 --> 00:50:24,090
Speaker 0: So, way to go, Sony.

876
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,406
Speaker 0: And you can get all four controllers for your Revolution, too.

877
00:50:27,426 --> 00:50:28,150
Speaker 0: I mean, your Wii.

878
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:35,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, keep in mind that this $600 figure, as far as we can tell, only comes with the system and one controller.

879
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:36,998
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

880
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,310
Speaker 0: Now, let's talk about that controller.

881
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:38,731
Speaker 1: Okay.

882
00:50:39,073 --> 00:50:40,542
Speaker 1: The fact that it costs $600 is not the bad news.

883
00:50:43,078 --> 00:50:43,310
Speaker 0: Okay.

884
00:50:44,191 --> 00:50:44,913
Speaker 1: The controller!

885
00:50:45,636 --> 00:50:50,810
Speaker 1: Now, remember way back, they showed us the Boomerang version of the controller, and they said this is going to be the controller.

886
00:50:51,011 --> 00:51:01,284
Speaker 0: And then I had a really popular thing on my blog where I found in an old GamePro magazine, there was a Boomerang controller back in the day, and I posted a picture like, "Sony ripped off these other people who made a Boomerang

887
00:51:01,304 --> 00:51:01,747
Speaker 0: controller.".

888
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:05,100
Speaker 1: Well, instead, one, Sony ripped off themselves.

889
00:51:05,221 --> 00:51:07,890
Speaker 1: It looks exactly like the DualShock with an extra button.

890
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:12,870
Speaker 0: It is the DualShock controller and has an extra PlayStation button right in the middle of it.

891
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,665
Speaker 1: Except it doesn't have the DualShock in it.

892
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,490
Speaker 0: They took it out.

893
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,890
Speaker 0: Well, I think that's because they got sued, remember, about the two vibrators?

894
00:51:20,011 --> 00:51:27,290
Speaker 1: They could have put a different thing in, because Nintendo doesn't infringe, and it would have been trivial to make a rumble thing that didn't infringe on that patent.

895
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:31,650
Speaker 0: Yep, but there is another reason why there is no rumbling going on.

896
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,010
Speaker 1: Now, before we say the reason, I'm sure some of you know.

897
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:35,809
Speaker 0: I'm sure everyone knows.

898
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:40,890
Speaker 1: Consider that part of the reason people like the DualShock is that it had rumbling in it.

899
00:51:41,051 --> 00:51:42,162
Speaker 1: That was, like, a good thing.

900
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,010
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

901
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,546
Speaker 1: The fact that there's no rumble at all really isn't great.

902
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:57,136
Speaker 0: Rumbling is one of those things, or when it came out on Starflex 64, like I said, I was kind of blagged, because it needed this rumble pack to pay extra money, and I was like, "Eh, it doesn't do anything.

903
00:51:57,176 --> 00:51:58,181
Speaker 0: It uses the gimmicky crap.

904
00:51:58,201 --> 00:51:59,487
Speaker 0: It doesn't enhance the game in any

905
00:51:59,527 --> 00:51:59,708
Speaker 0: way.".

906
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:07,208
Speaker 0: But after playing a lot of GameCube games, especially Metroids and Eternal Darknesses and Resident Evils-- Yeah, even F-Zero.

907
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:08,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, even F-Zero.

908
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:11,570
Speaker 1: I mean, some people use rumble stupidly.

909
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:12,349
Speaker 0: Mario Sunshine.

910
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, it'll be Super Rumble or off.

911
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:20,130
Speaker 1: But if you make the subtle little rumbles, like, you're driving a car, and there's this tiny subtle rumble--.

912
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,370
Speaker 0: Mario Party uses it well, even.

913
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:21,655
Speaker 0: Yeah.

914
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:26,130
Speaker 0: But, yeah, rumbling can make a game really good in a way.

915
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:32,850
Speaker 0: You don't even notice the rumbling, but it enhances, you know, through your feeling senses in your hands, you know.

916
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,190
Speaker 0: You'll, like, be worried about something, or you'll take a hit, and then it'll shake.

917
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:40,006
Speaker 0: And you won't think consciously, "Ooh, it's rumbling!

918
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:40,489
Speaker 0: Ooh, look at

919
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:40,670
Speaker 0: this!".

920
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,650
Speaker 0: 'Cause you're not paying attention to rumble packs anymore now that they're inside the controller where you can't see them.

921
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,562
Speaker 0: On the N64, you pay attention.

922
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,630
Speaker 0: Now you don't pay attention.

923
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,530
Speaker 0: But without it, you notice when it's gone.

924
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:55,050
Speaker 0: You go, "Oh, it's not rumbling," as soon as it's not there.

925
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:57,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, it really adds to the immersion in the game.

926
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:57,439
Speaker 1: Yep.

927
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,809
Speaker 1: Well, Sony got rid of that.

928
00:52:59,110 --> 00:52:59,180
Speaker 1: Yep.

929
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,090
Speaker 1: They pissed on that game.

930
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:07,930
Speaker 0: The reason they got rid of that is 'cause they've put in three axes of accelerometers inside the controller.

931
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:17,330
Speaker 1: The Sony, who said repeatedly that the revolution was stupid, and that their innovative controller was just a bullshit gimmick, ripped the gimmick off blatantly.

932
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:40,790
Speaker 0: Well, people are saying on the internet that they're not ripping off Nintendo, 'cause what Nintendo has done is in the Wii con- the nunchuck part of the revolution control- of the Wii controller, actually has the same accelerom- or, an equivalent accelerometer setup to what the PS3 controller's going to have, where you can tell when you tilt it forward, back, left, and right, and, you know, wiggle it up and down.

933
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:46,410
Speaker 0: But it can't tell where you're aiming it, and it can't tell where it is relative in space.

934
00:53:48,471 --> 00:53:54,540
Speaker 0: The revolution controller, the actual Wiivolution stick, the... The, what are we calling it?

935
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:55,750
Speaker 0: What are we calling it now?

936
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:56,670
Speaker 1: Let's call it the stick.

937
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:57,219
Speaker 0: Oh, the Wiimote.

938
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:57,810
Speaker 0: The Wiimote.

939
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:58,229
Speaker 1: Wiimote.

940
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,670
Speaker 0: So the Wiimote can actually tell where it is in space, so it's a pointing device.

941
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:07,389
Speaker 0: You can aim with it, you can swing it, as opposed to just tilting it.

942
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:17,805
Speaker 0: So, the PlayStation controller will probably be good for racing games, flying games, et cetera, but it's not gonna be good for shooting games, sword fighting games...

943
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:29,269
Speaker 1: Now, you might think that, but, by the same token, I'll note that controllers like that, and Microsoft brought this up right away when they were asked about what they thought of Sony's controller, they made controllers like that a long time ago.

944
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:29,539
Speaker 1: They did.

945
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,249
Speaker 0: Logitech and Microsoft made them for the PC.

946
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:34,449
Speaker 1: And there were even games that made use of it.

947
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:45,110
Speaker 1: And they found that having a standard controller, the type of controller you hold in two hands, like, you know, every controller out there except the Wii, doesn't really work so well.

948
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:50,370
Speaker 1: It's not intuitive or easy to manipulate it in such a way that you can control a game.

949
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:52,230
Speaker 1: It's just annoying and hurts your wrists.

950
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,869
Speaker 0: Because you're trying to do that while also trying to manage all the buttons.

951
00:54:56,651 --> 00:55:04,950
Speaker 0: People who had experience using the PlayStation 3 controller at the show said that they didn't know where to put their thumb.

952
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,503
Speaker 0: Should they put them on the analog sticks?

953
00:55:06,584 --> 00:55:07,210
Speaker 0: Take them off?

954
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,429
Speaker 0: You know, they couldn't figure out what the hell to do with it.

955
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:24,049
Speaker 1: So... Also, accelerometers and things like that and controllers of that level, you know, low-end consumer technology, they're not the most accurate thing, so it's kind of... You gotta... I don't think it's... It's very awkward to play with a controller like that.

956
00:55:24,773 --> 00:55:28,870
Speaker 1: And think about how many people, when they play games, just subconsciously move the controller around while they're playing.

957
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:34,150
Speaker 0: Well, that's good, because that's what you want people to do, is people move the controller while they play.

958
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,069
Speaker 0: It's something you naturally did back in the NES.

959
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,510
Speaker 0: That even said that during Nintendo's conferences.

960
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:45,049
Speaker 0: Do you remember back when you had an NES and, you know, the first time you picked it up, you would tilt the controller or, like, pull it back?

961
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:48,170
Speaker 0: Naturally, because you wanted your guy to move that way.

962
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:51,830
Speaker 1: God, my little brother... I should try to find some old home videos.

963
00:55:52,312 --> 00:55:55,670
Speaker 1: But, I mean, we were both really big gamers when we were kids.

964
00:55:56,512 --> 00:55:58,610
Speaker 1: And I would sit there and play and I'd move the controller around.

965
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:03,670
Speaker 1: He would stand in front of the TV and have this full-body motion.

966
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,909
Speaker 1: Like, when he was cornering, his whole body would bend and he'd hold the controller up.

967
00:56:08,658 --> 00:56:08,929
Speaker 0: Wow.

968
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:10,986
Speaker 1: It worked for him, but...

969
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:22,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the point of the Revolution controller, the Wiimote, is that you can take people's natural body movement and turn that into the game control.

970
00:56:22,832 --> 00:56:25,010
Speaker 0: So, that's what you have to go for.

971
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:30,510
Speaker 0: The thing is, is that the way the Sony is gonna do it isn't gonna work so well.

972
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,010
Speaker 0: Because, for example, it can tell when it's being tilted.

973
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:35,729
Speaker 0: But it can't tell if you hold it tilted.

974
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,109
Speaker 0: So, let's say I'm playing a racing game, right?

975
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:42,530
Speaker 0: So I tilt it to the right to turn right and I hold it in a tilted right position.

976
00:56:43,371 --> 00:56:47,570
Speaker 0: You're gonna have to do some wicked programming to know that I'm still holding it tilted right.

977
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:49,607
Speaker 1: And even if you do that programming...

978
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,390
Speaker 0: It only can tell when it's moving.

979
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:56,050
Speaker 0: It can't tell what its orientation is at any given time.

980
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:03,450
Speaker 1: Plus, with a system like that, if you don't make it really well and put a lot of time in the development process, it's not gonna be intuitive.

981
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:06,210
Speaker 1: It's gonna be awkward because it won't mesh up perfectly with the game.

982
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,990
Speaker 0: I think a lot of PlayStation games just aren't gonna use it at all.

983
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:15,010
Speaker 1: Well, considering that it really looks like they threw this feature in at the last minute...

984
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:19,710
Speaker 0: It seems a lot of the things that Sony does, it doesn't look like they're testing it on people.

985
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:30,290
Speaker 0: It seems that... I don't know what their attitude is, but the way it looks to me is that because they're so big at number one, they're just like, "Uh, anything with the PlayStation name will sell a bajillion.

986
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,570
Speaker 0: We don't actually have to make something quality or new or anything.

987
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:43,645
Speaker 0: We can just, you know, copy a little bit of the Xbox people and what they're doing so that they don't beat us in that department and copy a little bit of what the Nintendo's doing so they don't beat us in that

988
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:43,950
Speaker 0: department.".

989
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:47,708
Speaker 1: Yep, that way in the marketing they can say, "Yeah, we have motion control and

990
00:57:47,728 --> 00:57:48,030
Speaker 1: whatnot.".

991
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,930
Speaker 1: They'll probably call it something, just like the revolution.

992
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,496
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, "We got everything.

993
00:57:51,818 --> 00:57:54,130
Speaker 0: You know, we got what they got, we got what they got.

994
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:54,774
Speaker 0: We're number one.

995
00:57:55,399 --> 00:57:56,104
Speaker 0: We can do it all.

996
00:57:56,285 --> 00:57:56,467
Speaker 0: Buy

997
00:57:56,587 --> 00:57:56,648
Speaker 0: us.".

998
00:57:57,738 --> 00:57:57,908
Speaker 1: Yeah.

999
00:57:58,330 --> 00:57:58,417
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1000
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,550
Speaker 0: Alright, so let's talk about what else they got going on.

1001
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:05,930
Speaker 0: The PlayStation 3 will come out November 11th in Japan and November 17th in the USA.

1002
00:58:06,492 --> 00:58:07,644
Speaker 0: My brother's birthday is November 17th.

1003
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:08,315
Speaker 1: Ah.

1004
00:58:09,616 --> 00:58:12,010
Speaker 1: Um... I'm honestly surprised they even made that date.

1005
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:16,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I remember the other PlayStations coming out.

1006
00:58:17,051 --> 00:58:23,849
Speaker 0: There was some other stuff that came out around that time because I remember it was like my brother's birthday and then something would come out and then he would go get it.

1007
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,668
Speaker 0: I don't know what it was.

1008
00:58:26,311 --> 00:58:28,030
Speaker 0: It might have been a PlayStation 2, I don't remember.

1009
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,770
Speaker 0: We should look up the PS2 release date.

1010
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:39,049
Speaker 1: Though I do remember that when they had the guy on stage with that controller, just to go back to the controller a bit, and they showed him playing this game, it didn't look like it worked.

1011
00:58:40,372 --> 00:58:41,969
Speaker 0: Well, I think it did work, it just...

1012
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:42,590
Speaker 1: No, it just not well.

1013
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,770
Speaker 0: I think they were doing a demo, you know, a fake demo.

1014
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:46,849
Speaker 0: Just like all their other demos are fake.

1015
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:51,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, the thing is, if they faked it, it looked like it was real and just bad.

1016
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:55,490
Speaker 1: Like, it looked like the guy had a hard time making it control the game properly.

1017
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,129
Speaker 0: That's something else I want to point out right away.

1018
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:09,529
Speaker 0: At the Sony conference, most of the videos that they showed, because they didn't show all that much real gameplay, were videos of pre-rendered stuff that...

1019
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:10,650
Speaker 1: Oh, God, we'll get to that.

1020
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were, uh, bullshots.

1021
00:59:14,091 --> 00:59:15,001
Speaker 1: Ah, Penny Arcade.

1022
00:59:15,061 --> 00:59:15,890
Speaker 1: A perfectly turbulent world.

1023
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:17,609
Speaker 0: They were just pre-rendered CG videos.

1024
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,729
Speaker 0: They weren't videos of what the game is like.

1025
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:23,889
Speaker 0: You know, the Metal Gear Solid thing, it's pretty cool, but that's not what the game looks like.

1026
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:24,667
Speaker 0: That's just a video.

1027
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,768
Speaker 1: Nintendo was all, "This is what the gameplay will look

1028
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:27,949
Speaker 1: like.".

1029
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:38,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think Nintendo showed a single video, everything they showed on the screen, the only pre-rendered animation they showed was the little eyes that were dancing around the Wii logo.

1030
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:40,990
Speaker 1: And there's no Wii dancing eye game.

1031
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:50,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything they showed was either video from a game, or video of models, you know, playing with Wii controllers to show you what it's like to play the game.

1032
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:52,898
Speaker 0: They didn't show anything else.

1033
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,489
Speaker 0: Maybe Nintendo logo or two.

1034
00:59:54,750 --> 01:00:01,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, and even the games they showed that may not be done yet, where it might have been kind of tweaked, it was definitely at least the level of graphics that'll be in the game.

1035
01:00:02,062 --> 01:00:02,250
Speaker 0: Yep.

1036
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,729
Speaker 1: Now, Sony, they announced all their games and they showed them.

1037
01:00:06,551 --> 01:00:10,910
Speaker 1: Now, Metal Gear Solid 4 is the one game that seems to have been generating a lot of buzz.

1038
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,548
Speaker 1: That and Gran Turismo HD.

1039
01:00:13,692 --> 01:00:16,190
Speaker 0: Well, Gran Turismo HD is not going to be a game, so I'm going to talk about that.

1040
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:18,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was going to get to that, but I want to do MSG first.

1041
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:18,730
Speaker 1: Alright.

1042
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:20,169
Speaker 1: Because I was excited about it.

1043
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:20,280
Speaker 1: MGS.

1044
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:21,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

1045
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:23,410
Speaker 1: I want some MSG, I'm kind of hungry.

1046
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:34,310
Speaker 1: But I was kind of excited about it, because I haven't played any of these new Metal Gear games, but I like Metal Gear, I like the franchise, I mostly like the story, and I like the gameplay.

1047
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:35,589
Speaker 1: I like the idea of the games.

1048
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,350
Speaker 0: I like the gameplay of Metal Gear Solid-type games, actually.

1049
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:41,190
Speaker 0: You know, the stealth, sneak around, shoot guys games.

1050
01:00:41,731 --> 01:00:43,410
Speaker 0: There seem to be a lot more of those now.

1051
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:45,210
Speaker 0: Isn't the Splinter Cells like that, right?

1052
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:46,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, and some missions.

1053
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't actually played any of the Splinter Cells.

1054
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,390
Speaker 0: Maybe I should get around to that.

1055
01:00:50,530 --> 01:01:02,710
Speaker 1: Because, I mean, Metal Gear, when it came out for the NES, was really the first big game that had gameplay like that, where you were a military guy, and your goal was to hide from your enemies at all costs.

1056
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,290
Speaker 0: I think it was the Metal Gear Solid for the GameCube.

1057
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,469
Speaker 0: I should go pick that up now.

1058
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:05,837
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1059
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:06,275
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1060
01:01:07,113 --> 01:01:08,188
Speaker 1: I don't know why we didn't buy it.

1061
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,750
Speaker 1: I love those games, but anyway.

1062
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:16,526
Speaker 1: So, Metal Gear Solid 4, and there's been little tiny bits of buzz that this game is going to be like the end-all.

1063
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:17,948
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

1064
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,748
Speaker 1: So, then they show the stuff about it at E3.

1065
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:28,650
Speaker 1: They did not show, as far as I can tell, a single second, not even one frame of gameplay.

1066
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:29,330
Speaker 0: Nope.

1067
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,790
Speaker 1: What it was, was an awesome trailer for a movie.

1068
01:01:33,371 --> 01:01:38,350
Speaker 1: If they were making Metal Gear Solid 4 the movie, that's a badass movie, and I'd go see it immediately.

1069
01:01:38,692 --> 01:01:39,169
Speaker 0: Oh, hell yeah.

1070
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:41,490
Speaker 0: Much better than Uwe Boll.

1071
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,370
Speaker 1: It looks like an awesome plot and an awesome movie.

1072
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,109
Speaker 1: I don't know if there's a game there.

1073
01:01:47,191 --> 01:01:48,010
Speaker 0: We haven't seen a game.

1074
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,929
Speaker 0: If there is, they're not showing it to us.

1075
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:55,469
Speaker 1: The crowd certainly reacted to the final shot of the trailer, which showed Solid Snake as an old man.

1076
01:01:56,851 --> 01:02:02,090
Speaker 1: It's definitely an old man disillusioned with all that he's done in his life in warfare and killing.

1077
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:06,388
Speaker 1: And it ends with him putting a gun in his mouth, and he's about to kill himself.

1078
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:08,750
Speaker 1: And the crowd really reacted to that.

1079
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:09,239
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1080
01:02:09,751 --> 01:02:13,826
Speaker 0: But they reacted more to the fact that it was Solid Snake going to kill himself than, "Oh my God, this

1081
01:02:13,846 --> 01:02:14,128
Speaker 0: game.".

1082
01:02:14,675 --> 01:02:15,709
Speaker 1: Because they didn't show the game.

1083
01:02:15,914 --> 01:02:16,170
Speaker 0: I know.

1084
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:19,747
Speaker 1: They basically said, "Hey, here's the plot of the game we're coming out

1085
01:02:19,787 --> 01:02:19,928
Speaker 1: with.".

1086
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:20,237
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

1087
01:02:21,651 --> 01:02:25,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's a lot of things that PlayStation games have going for them as plots.

1088
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,369
Speaker 0: It's mostly RPGs and games with these heavy sorts of plots on them.

1089
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:33,710
Speaker 0: Things are going to have a freaking Blu-ray drive.

1090
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:35,009
Speaker 0: That's what you put movies on.

1091
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:36,529
Speaker 0: That's what Sony's all about.

1092
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:36,940
Speaker 1: Yep.

1093
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:46,448
Speaker 1: The problem is, whenever they have these plots in these games, it seems more and more that the plot is play a game and then watch an FMV that has plot, and then play more game and then watch an FMV.

1094
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:46,922
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

1095
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:50,727
Speaker 1: You've got to have the games that integrate the plot with the game, like Half-Life did.

1096
01:02:51,274 --> 01:02:51,508
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1097
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:51,880
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1098
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:52,830
Speaker 0: All right.

1099
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,909
Speaker 0: Let's talk about some of the other things that went down.

1100
01:02:55,757 --> 01:02:56,270
Speaker 1: Gran Turismo?

1101
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:56,823
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1102
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:57,988
Speaker 0: Gran Turismo HD.

1103
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:02,648
Speaker 0: Now, I never actually played Gran Turismo 4, so I didn't know what it looked like.

1104
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:07,210
Speaker 0: When I saw Gran Turismo HD, I said, "Wow, I'm actually freaking interested in that.

1105
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:08,927
Speaker 0: That looks like the best racing game

1106
01:03:09,028 --> 01:03:09,150
Speaker 0: ever.".

1107
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:12,690
Speaker 1: We've been playing Gran Turismo, what, 2 on our PlayStation 1?

1108
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:14,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not so good nowadays.

1109
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:21,910
Speaker 0: But I really like racing games, and it seems like the only thing Nintendo is seriously lacking in is real racing games.

1110
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:25,550
Speaker 0: We've got Mario Karts, and we go, "Oh, right, Diddy Kong Racing DS.

1111
01:03:25,731 --> 01:03:26,081
Speaker 0: Forgot that

1112
01:03:26,163 --> 01:03:26,287
Speaker 0: one.".

1113
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:26,498
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1114
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:27,768
Speaker 0: But that's going to be pretty cool.

1115
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:33,410
Speaker 0: Nintendo doesn't have the realist to racing games, really, at all.

1116
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:36,030
Speaker 0: I mean, there was R Racing Revolution for the GameCube.

1117
01:03:36,072 --> 01:03:36,549
Speaker 0: That sucked.

1118
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:37,547
Speaker 0: It wasn't good at all.

1119
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:46,549
Speaker 0: PlayStation's got their Ridge Racers and their Gran Turismos, and Microsoft has their Forzas and their, what's it called, Project Gotham.

1120
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:48,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, but when we get to Microsoft, we'll talk about that.

1121
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:52,350
Speaker 1: I think Microsoft is going to win the Realistic Gaming trophy.

1122
01:03:53,450 --> 01:04:00,003
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm all about these racing games, so when I saw Gran Turismo HD, I was like, "Ooh, that looks like the best damn racing game

1123
01:04:00,084 --> 01:04:00,225
Speaker 0: ever.".

1124
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:04,490
Speaker 0: Apparently, what Gran Turismo HD was is not a game.

1125
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:10,125
Speaker 0: What it was, they took Gran Turismo 4, and they did something to it to make it go 1080i resolution.

1126
01:04:11,811 --> 01:04:17,834
Speaker 0: So all it was was a prototype game designed to show you, "Yes, look at this.

1127
01:04:18,135 --> 01:04:23,670
Speaker 0: The PlayStation 3 can do a full HD game in real time.

1128
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:24,417
Speaker 0: Look at it go.

1129
01:04:24,477 --> 01:04:24,801
Speaker 0: There it

1130
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:24,963
Speaker 0: is.".

1131
01:04:26,093 --> 01:04:28,610
Speaker 0: And all it tells me is, "Hey, that looks really good.

1132
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:30,304
Speaker 0: I'm going to get Gran Turismo 4 for the

1133
01:04:30,364 --> 01:04:30,404
Speaker 0: PS2.".

1134
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:31,410
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1135
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,349
Speaker 0: Because I don't have an HDTV.

1136
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:40,830
Speaker 1: And even if we did, I mean, the HD doesn't really seem to be a good selling point on a console.

1137
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:54,368
Speaker 0: Well, it is something that people there seem to all agree upon, because I wasn't there and I didn't see this, that there were some shots and videos of actual gameplay on the PS3, and they looked really good.

1138
01:04:55,290 --> 01:05:02,089
Speaker 0: But people seem to say that they didn't really look that much better or sometimes not as good as what the Xbox 360 looks like.

1139
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:02,833
Speaker 1: Huh.

1140
01:05:03,794 --> 01:05:04,148
Speaker 0: I wonder.

1141
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:06,750
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't care about the graphics in a game.

1142
01:05:07,191 --> 01:05:09,804
Speaker 0: The graphics are not so important.

1143
01:05:09,945 --> 01:05:10,930
Speaker 0: It's the game that matters.

1144
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,270
Speaker 1: Well, as long as the graphics don't get in the way of the game.

1145
01:05:13,893 --> 01:05:26,570
Speaker 0: But when you're Sony and you keep bragging about the graphics so much, and then they're not that super amazing, as you've been saying, or they don't-- It doesn't matter how super amazing they are.

1146
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:32,930
Speaker 0: If people don't go along with what you're saying and they say, "Yeah, I'm not really impressed," well, you've got a problem.

1147
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:37,250
Speaker 1: You know, maybe it's getting to the point where diminishing returns.

1148
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:42,370
Speaker 1: I mean, 720p is really nice, and it is better than what we've got now.

1149
01:05:43,574 --> 01:05:45,289
Speaker 1: Our crappy NTSC whatnot.

1150
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:51,470
Speaker 1: But once you get to 1080i and 1080p, the difference isn't quite as noticeable.

1151
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:58,750
Speaker 1: And as you get beyond that, there's no difference as far as human eyes can tell, unless you've got a thousand-foot screen.

1152
01:05:59,210 --> 01:05:59,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, who knows?

1153
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:01,749
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1154
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:14,350
Speaker 0: I mean, it looks really nice, but I don't think that it's that super amazing that people are going to say, "Oh my god, the PS3 blows the Xbox 360 out of the water on graphics.

1155
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,865
Speaker 0: It's the winner in that

1156
01:06:15,926 --> 01:06:16,148
Speaker 0: fight.".

1157
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:16,928
Speaker 1: It really doesn't.

1158
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:18,990
Speaker 0: They're both pretty much tied in that fight.

1159
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:24,310
Speaker 0: And as always, computers are going to win, and I'm going to get to why that's real important when I talk about Microsoft.

1160
01:06:24,834 --> 01:06:24,923
Speaker 1: Yup.

1161
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:28,450
Speaker 1: So all in all, Sony really didn't impress anyone.

1162
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,770
Speaker 0: Well, no, here's the stuff that they had that I thought was good.

1163
01:06:31,394 --> 01:06:32,486
Speaker 0: They had a thing with the iToy.

1164
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:35,928
Speaker 0: The iToy, if you don't know, is this camera you can get for your PS2.

1165
01:06:36,498 --> 01:06:37,010
Speaker 1: Oh yeah!

1166
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:40,690
Speaker 0: And the iToy had some pretty crummy games.

1167
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,448
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone actually bought them or used them.

1168
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:47,470
Speaker 0: But they did a demo, which they should have, you know, put a lot more emphasis on.

1169
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:50,549
Speaker 0: It seemed sort of like they did this and said, "Look, we have this,".

1170
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:54,990
Speaker 0: but then they didn't really play it out, you know, and make a big deal out of it.

1171
01:06:55,430 --> 01:07:01,413
Speaker 0: What it is, is the iToy looks at this table, and you put cards down on the table, and sort of like

1172
01:07:01,473 --> 01:07:02,136
Speaker 0: Yu-Gi-Oh!,

1173
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:04,870
Speaker 0: the iToy sees the cards and it makes monsters.

1174
01:07:05,653 --> 01:07:15,448
Speaker 0: And then you can like gesture with your hands, and the iToy will see your gestures, and you can command your monsters on the table to play a cool game in a Yu-Gi-Oh!

1175
01:07:15,508 --> 01:07:16,150
Speaker 0: type of style.

1176
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:19,210
Speaker 0: I think that's something really good, that Sony should try more of that shit.

1177
01:07:19,515 --> 01:07:19,707
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1178
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:21,069
Speaker 0: That'd be a whole lot of fun.

1179
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:27,390
Speaker 1: Sony, they're the company who decried Nintendo for being gimmicky, and while this is cool, it is definitely gimmicky.

1180
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:38,990
Speaker 0: No, I think gimmicky means you, at least to me, gimmicky means you have some sort of trick that doesn't actually enhance the thing itself.

1181
01:07:40,253 --> 01:07:44,970
Speaker 0: Like, um, if you put, uh, here's in the golf clubs are the most gimmicky things in the world.

1182
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:52,468
Speaker 0: Someone will say, "Check out this golf club, it has this awesomely shaped head with titanium.

1183
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:53,029
Speaker 0: insert

1184
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:53,450
Speaker 0: something.".

1185
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:55,489
Speaker 1: Yep, you know what kills the golf argument right away?

1186
01:07:56,931 --> 01:08:03,390
Speaker 1: Have golf scores decreased in a trend as technology of golfing in golf clubs has increased?

1187
01:08:03,931 --> 01:08:12,270
Speaker 0: Yes, but the point is, is that you look at the golf club and it has this fancy doodad on it, but the fancy doodad doesn't actually do anything.

1188
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:21,290
Speaker 0: But here, you know, that's why people say that the DS was so gimmicky, because it had all these fancy doodads, like a microphone and a touchscreen, the problem is they do something.

1189
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:22,630
Speaker 0: So they're not gimmicks.

1190
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:30,970
Speaker 1: I guess I wonder if Sony has the support to actually use that in a non-gimmicky way on more than a handful of games.

1191
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:36,729
Speaker 0: See, that's the thing, is they could do it on a handful of games and it wouldn't be gimmicky if they actually used it in this way.

1192
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:45,290
Speaker 0: The problem is, will they do it on enough games to make it a wise economic decision to buy an eye toy and buy these games?

1193
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:51,170
Speaker 0: It could be a Super Scope, but the Super Scope wasn't gimmicky, but it just didn't have enough games to make it worth buying.

1194
01:08:51,392 --> 01:08:53,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just don't see the developers getting behind it.

1195
01:08:53,810 --> 01:09:00,010
Speaker 1: And plus, I wonder what type of development, because obviously developing for something like this is not the same as developing for the PlayStation itself.

1196
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:00,337
Speaker 0: No.

1197
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:05,490
Speaker 1: Of course, they also have the problem that the PlayStation is using those IBM cell processors.

1198
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:19,590
Speaker 1: And I could talk at length about the pros and cons of that and what IBM strategy, in my eyes as a former employee, even though I'm still working there, was regarding it.

1199
01:09:19,991 --> 01:09:27,910
Speaker 1: But I can say that developing for the PlayStation 3 is not easy, it is not trivial, it is not something people can do without a lot of work.

1200
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:38,729
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is that people are used to programming in a certain way, and the cell processors have a different architecture than most other chips that people are used to, so you have to program for it in an all-new way.

1201
01:09:40,252 --> 01:09:46,310
Speaker 0: And to make it easier, Sony could provide a lot of tools, but even they really don't know how to program for it so well.

1202
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:53,609
Speaker 0: So it's like this whole new territory, and it's going to take them a lot of time to develop tools, and then to use those tools to develop better games, and it's...

1203
01:09:54,069 --> 01:10:00,190
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, now the people who developed for the PS2 are still making PS2 games, because they've got that down pat.

1204
01:10:00,691 --> 01:10:04,461
Speaker 0: I read somewhere today, I can't verify this 100%, that there will be 216 new PlayStation 2 games by the end of the year.

1205
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:08,491
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't doubt it.

1206
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:19,130
Speaker 1: I remember I read an article a few weeks ago where some company had two games that were going to be PS3 games, that they just said, "Fuck it," because the PS3 was delayed, and there was trouble with the dev kits, and they made them PS2 games.

1207
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:23,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, now here's something to compare this to Nintendo and Microsoft.

1208
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,887
Speaker 0: Microsoft, if you want to make a game for the Xbox 360, it's DirectX.

1209
01:10:27,272 --> 01:10:27,949
Speaker 1: Everyone knows DirectX.

1210
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,108
Speaker 0: It's always been DirectX.

1211
01:10:29,911 --> 01:10:30,890
Speaker 1: DirectX is well-documented.

1212
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:34,160
Speaker 0: It's almost exactly like making a game for Windows.

1213
01:10:34,782 --> 01:10:35,885
Speaker 0: Everyone knows how to do it.

1214
01:10:36,146 --> 01:10:37,570
Speaker 0: You can buy a book on it in the store.

1215
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:39,478
Speaker 1: Yep, it's well-documented, well-understood.

1216
01:10:39,558 --> 01:10:42,190
Speaker 1: We could teach anyone out there how to do a trivial game.

1217
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,452
Speaker 0: Yep, Nintendo.

1218
01:10:43,972 --> 01:10:55,410
Speaker 0: Now, it's not publicly available information how to make Nintendo games for their hardware, but if you are able to get a development kit from them, they give you everything you need.

1219
01:10:55,610 --> 01:11:03,768
Speaker 0: In fact, just today at the press conference, they were saying, "Yeah, and no one's going to have to write this code because we wrote the network stack, and we'll just give it to all the

1220
01:11:03,788 --> 01:11:04,309
Speaker 0: developers.".

1221
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:04,750
Speaker 1: Yep.

1222
01:11:05,111 --> 01:11:14,190
Speaker 1: Also, they have said that the Nintendo Wii and the way you write software for it is very similar to the way you write software for the GameCube.

1223
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:20,610
Speaker 0: Oh, the early dev kits for the Wii were all just GameCubes with attachments to hook up the Wii controllers.

1224
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:23,390
Speaker 1: Yep, because the only real difference is that it's more powerful.

1225
01:11:23,852 --> 01:11:24,930
Speaker 0: And it has more peripherals.

1226
01:11:25,052 --> 01:11:28,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you have more-- And it has a different disk that holds more storage.

1227
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:31,990
Speaker 1: So you have more options for input, more options for storage, and more power.

1228
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:35,197
Speaker 1: Other than that, the API's the same.

1229
01:11:35,217 --> 01:11:39,269
Speaker 1: You still have a, "Alright, hitting a button calls this thing or does this

1230
01:11:39,309 --> 01:11:39,530
Speaker 1: thing.".

1231
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:51,610
Speaker 0: The PS3 is a whole new world, and I think that what might see happen is the PS3 isn't going to bomb and kill Sony like the Dreamcast or anything like that.

1232
01:11:51,831 --> 01:11:52,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's hard to kill Sony.

1233
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:58,790
Speaker 0: There are enough people out there who really, really want it and want the games that are on it, and they're going to make money, I guess.

1234
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:19,910
Speaker 0: But, eventually, what's going to happen over time is there's a chance that as developers learn how to make PlayStation 3 games, that you'll start to see, like, the second or third round of PS3 games coming out will start to get graphics that are way better than the Microsoft Xbox.

1235
01:12:20,595 --> 01:12:20,809
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1236
01:12:21,252 --> 01:12:26,130
Speaker 0: Gameplay that takes advantage of the TILTI controller and all that sort of stuff.

1237
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:29,968
Speaker 1: However, I see that as definitely a situation of, "Too little, too

1238
01:12:30,029 --> 01:12:30,230
Speaker 1: late."

1239
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:36,010
Speaker 1: And it won't tank, but I really think the PS3 is going to be the trailing third console in the war.

1240
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:37,162
Speaker 1: Well, quote-unquote

1241
01:12:37,203 --> 01:12:37,427
Speaker 1: "war.".

1242
01:12:37,871 --> 01:12:43,627
Speaker 0: It'll definitely, I think, the PS3 not do as well as the Xbox 360 overall.

1243
01:12:45,692 --> 01:12:52,530
Speaker 0: At least, at the very least, it won't completely demolish the other systems the way it did in the previous generation.

1244
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:55,224
Speaker 0: It'll be on par with the Xbox 360 at most.

1245
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:59,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, and my prediction is that it will be the trailing console.

1246
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:02,510
Speaker 1: It's going to be playing catch-up with Nintendo and Microsoft.

1247
01:13:04,071 --> 01:13:08,329
Speaker 0: So, here's some other interesting tidbits that Sony went over.

1248
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,350
Speaker 1: Didn't they say they're going to have two million of them right away?

1249
01:13:14,151 --> 01:13:14,492
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1250
01:13:14,512 --> 01:13:19,910
Speaker 0: There'll be two million right away, and then four million a little while later, and then, like, eight million a little while later.

1251
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:22,608
Speaker 1: Now, I saw a few reports that people said, "No, they only have one

1252
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:22,910
Speaker 1: million.".

1253
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,058
Speaker 1: But I don't know.

1254
01:13:24,078 --> 01:13:25,690
Speaker 1: I didn't chase any of that down.

1255
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, who knows how many they have.

1256
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:29,430
Speaker 0: But that's how many they said they'd have.

1257
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:34,630
Speaker 1: Now, I wonder, because the Xbox sold out right away, and there were supply problems.

1258
01:13:34,751 --> 01:13:38,750
Speaker 1: But it was kind of, it wasn't as expensive as the PlayStation 3.

1259
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:48,670
Speaker 0: Actually, Microsoft did a good comparison at their conference of, like, sales per unit time and all that, and how the Xbox 360 actually kind of beat the iPod.

1260
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:53,410
Speaker 0: But the iPod was sort of a slow, gradual build-up to a bigger number than, you know.

1261
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:59,030
Speaker 0: But the rate of sales to the Xbox 360 in its early days was, like, tremendous, more than anything ever.

1262
01:13:59,454 --> 01:13:59,669
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1263
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:00,222
Speaker 0: Insane.

1264
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:07,170
Speaker 1: However, that was partly because there was a number of them, and there was a number greater than that number of people who would pay any price to have one.

1265
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,070
Speaker 1: So pretty much, the sales were instant, and then there were no more.

1266
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:13,970
Speaker 1: But now they're back on the market, and they're not really moving so fast.

1267
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:15,548
Speaker 0: Nope, not so much.

1268
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:20,250
Speaker 0: But I think they will as soon as the next round of Xbox 360 goodies goes out.

1269
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:23,070
Speaker 1: Especially when the new Xbox 360s come out.

1270
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:30,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, and in the holiday season, expect a lot of Xbox 360s to start moving for all the people who didn't buy one for their kids yet.

1271
01:14:31,351 --> 01:14:38,350
Speaker 1: Of course, the revolution might really put a dent into that, especially as the economy gets the way it's going.

1272
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we'll see.

1273
01:14:39,832 --> 01:14:39,966
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1274
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:51,970
Speaker 0: The PSP is going to--they didn't really explain this, but the online service for the PlayStation 3, the equivalent of Xbox Live, is going to have some stuff.

1275
01:14:53,750 --> 01:15:03,030
Speaker 0: It's going to have some, you know, cool games you download and video chat with people, and they're going to make the whole big community thing.

1276
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:13,110
Speaker 0: They're going to try to do everything that Xbox Live does, but their main thing is the inclusion of the rest of Sony's business of music and movies and all that shit.

1277
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:20,089
Speaker 0: You know, so some of the stuff they're going to do is, like, download a video and watch it.

1278
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they'd better do something like that.

1279
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:24,690
Speaker 1: UMD, as a movie format, is dead.

1280
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:27,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, download something to a memory stick and put it in your PSP.

1281
01:15:28,512 --> 01:15:29,990
Speaker 1: Oh, the thing we wanted from the start?

1282
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:30,766
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1283
01:15:32,191 --> 01:15:39,430
Speaker 0: Well, of course, you'd be paying for it through the PlayStation online service, DRMing it to the memory stick and all that, right?

1284
01:15:40,231 --> 01:15:42,604
Speaker 0: There's going to be one thing--I didn't read all the details.

1285
01:15:44,892 --> 01:15:55,329
Speaker 0: What it sounds like to me is you'll be able to take and pay for a PlayStation 1 game, download it to a memory stick, shove it in your PSP and play it.

1286
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:56,793
Speaker 1: Huh.

1287
01:15:58,252 --> 01:15:59,528
Speaker 0: That sounds pretty good to me.

1288
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:00,383
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1289
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:04,949
Speaker 0: A little emulator thing, and they said that there'll be, like, a firmware coming up that supports it.

1290
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:11,030
Speaker 1: Of course, for me, if I had a PSP, I'd just hack it up with the old firmware and just have an NES/SNES emulator in there.

1291
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:11,482
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

1292
01:16:11,931 --> 01:16:16,490
Speaker 0: And they said there'll be some sort of micropayment system, so you'll buy these Sony cards.

1293
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:20,650
Speaker 0: Not the Sony credit card that I have, but the regular, like, a little clear card.

1294
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:25,530
Speaker 0: And then you can use that card to buy things on the Sony online service.

1295
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:32,930
Speaker 1: I don't like how Sony really seems to like the idea of just constantly ringing all their customers for money as long as they own a PlayStation 3.

1296
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:35,410
Speaker 0: Well, Microsoft is doing a similar thing with Xbox Live.

1297
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:36,650
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't like that anymore.

1298
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:37,038
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1299
01:16:38,972 --> 01:16:45,450
Speaker 0: Uh, one of the examples they showed of, uh, is probably the best example of how this thing is gonna work is the SingStar karaoke.

1300
01:16:46,350 --> 01:17:02,510
Speaker 0: Now, what this looked like is they didn't actually have any prices on it, but it's a karaoke game where you would go online to this, you know, site or place interface in the Sony online thing with your PS3, and you can pick songs and karaoke them.

1301
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:07,290
Speaker 0: And the thing was is you would pay to get more songs.

1302
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:09,996
Speaker 0: See, you know, it's like, "Oh, I wanna karaoke that song

1303
01:17:10,036 --> 01:17:10,216
Speaker 0: now.".

1304
01:17:10,276 --> 01:17:12,262
Speaker 0: You pay, like, 25 cents or whatever.

1305
01:17:12,302 --> 01:17:13,666
Speaker 0: They didn't show any prices on it.

1306
01:17:13,746 --> 01:17:16,811
Speaker 0: Everything was, like, $1,000.

1307
01:17:16,811 --> 01:17:20,690
Speaker 0: And this is, you know, you get the music video, and you get the words, and you get the song.

1308
01:17:21,251 --> 01:17:24,050
Speaker 0: And now you've got it, and you can karaoke it and all that.

1309
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:29,600
Speaker 0: So, we'll see how well that works, you know.

1310
01:17:30,221 --> 01:17:33,188
Speaker 0: Do people really wanna keep paying for more karaoke songs?

1311
01:17:33,389 --> 01:17:33,830
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1312
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:36,632
Speaker 0: We'll see, eh.

1313
01:17:37,193 --> 01:17:44,630
Speaker 0: But that's the example of how they're combining their music business and their PlayStation business into this one sort of media.

1314
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:49,930
Speaker 0: They're really going more towards the media thing and not so much, I don't know.

1315
01:17:50,613 --> 01:17:54,329
Speaker 1: I just think they're going in too many directions at once, which they always seem to try to do now.

1316
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:56,676
Speaker 0: Well, here's another thing you gotta remember.

1317
01:17:56,696 --> 01:18:00,470
Speaker 0: Remember when the PlayStation 1 came out, and they had the E3 conference for that?

1318
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,937
Speaker 0: They said all this stuff, and they only did some of it.

1319
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:07,270
Speaker 0: When the PlayStation 2 came out, they said they were gonna do all this stuff, and they only did some of it.

1320
01:18:07,511 --> 01:18:07,675
Speaker 1: Huh.

1321
01:18:07,922 --> 01:18:08,169
Speaker 1: Trend.

1322
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:13,905
Speaker 0: I guarantee that not all the stuff Sony said they were gonna do with the PS3 today will be done.

1323
01:18:13,925 --> 01:18:15,650
Speaker 0: A lot of it is just never gonna happen.

1324
01:18:16,032 --> 01:18:17,096
Speaker 1: It seems like they fish.

1325
01:18:17,236 --> 01:18:20,730
Speaker 1: They'll throw out a bunch of stuff, see what people react to, and then react accordingly.

1326
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:24,035
Speaker 0: And they see what everyone else does, and then they do that.

1327
01:18:24,055 --> 01:18:27,121
Speaker 0: I don't think they actually have a guiding vision.

1328
01:18:27,141 --> 01:18:31,190
Speaker 0: There's no one at Sony who's thinking and planning about what to do.

1329
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:32,796
Speaker 0: They're just doing.

1330
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:35,310
Speaker 0: Like, you know, going through the motions.

1331
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:45,710
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's talk about... I'm not gonna go through all the games on the PS3 and what's gonna come out on it, like we did for the DS.

1332
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:47,097
Speaker 1: We can do the big ones.

1333
01:18:47,117 --> 01:18:49,170
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy 13.

1334
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:49,591
Speaker 0: Well, hold on.

1335
01:18:49,631 --> 01:18:50,654
Speaker 0: I wanna talk about that last.

1336
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,449
Speaker 0: Let me just say, here are five of the games coming out for the PS3.

1337
01:18:56,210 --> 01:19:01,746
Speaker 0: Metal Gear Solid 4, Tekken 6, Virtua Fighter 5, Virtua Tennis 3, Ridge Racer 7.

1338
01:19:01,746 --> 01:19:03,030
Speaker 0: What do those games all have in common?

1339
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:04,730
Speaker 1: Huh.

1340
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:05,910
Speaker 0: Huh.

1341
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:15,570
Speaker 0: Let me... Metal Gear Solid 4, Tekken 6, Virtua Fighter 5, Virtua Tennis 3, Ridge Racer 7.

1342
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:15,938
Speaker 0: See a pattern yet?

1343
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:16,450
Speaker 1: See a pattern?

1344
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:19,653
Speaker 0: Where are the games that are original?

1345
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:39,045
Speaker 0: Now, granted, there were a few original games that were named, but there were plenty of games... Like, Resident Evil Code Veronica isn't a number, but it's a sequel.

1346
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:40,430
Speaker 0: It's that kind of thing.

1347
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:44,929
Speaker 0: So, where are the new franchises, the new games, the new whatnots?

1348
01:19:45,271 --> 01:19:46,769
Speaker 1: Sony doesn't make new franchises.

1349
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:47,912
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

1350
01:19:48,012 --> 01:19:54,930
Speaker 0: It's all up to the third parties, and the third parties, you know, it's the same old PlayStation 3, the controller looks like the same old thing.

1351
01:19:55,711 --> 01:20:00,450
Speaker 0: They're gonna make the same old thing for it and see how long they can just keep making money that way.

1352
01:20:00,692 --> 01:20:00,887
Speaker 1: Yep.

1353
01:20:01,411 --> 01:20:03,135
Speaker 0: And it'll probably work.

1354
01:20:03,175 --> 01:20:04,758
Speaker 0: I don't know how much longer it will work.

1355
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:10,390
Speaker 0: If it works for this generation, I don't see it working for yet another generation of games.

1356
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:13,309
Speaker 0: So they've got less than five years to come up with something new.

1357
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,430
Speaker 1: Well, consider the Final Fantasy XIII trailer they showed.

1358
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:18,810
Speaker 0: Let's talk about Final Fantasy XIII, and then we're done with Sony.

1359
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:19,612
Speaker 0: It didn't...

1360
01:20:19,932 --> 01:20:25,729
Speaker 1: Like, I saw it, and I watched it, and I thought, "That looks like every other Final Fantasy game ever, except for the

1361
01:20:25,749 --> 01:20:26,010
Speaker 1: originals.".

1362
01:20:26,653 --> 01:20:26,988
Speaker 1: It's just...

1363
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:28,809
Speaker 0: It looks like every Final Fantasy since VIII.

1364
01:20:29,251 --> 01:20:37,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, just, "Oh, look, there's an FMV of a girl doing something awesome, and there's a lot of choreography, and, oh, it's all intense and

1365
01:20:37,788 --> 01:20:38,409
Speaker 1: futuristic.".

1366
01:20:40,197 --> 01:20:40,528
Speaker 1: That's it.

1367
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:45,789
Speaker 0: Now, here's the thing about Final Fantasy XIII, is there's going to be at least three versions of it.

1368
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:51,449
Speaker 0: There's going to be, from what I've heard, this isn't solid, there's going to be the actual game, Final Fantasy XIII.

1369
01:20:52,291 --> 01:21:01,589
Speaker 0: There's going to be another game, Final Fantasy XIII Versus, for the PlayStation 3, which I suppose will be some sort of, "You fight your guys against someone else's guys and see who's

1370
01:21:01,629 --> 01:21:01,829
Speaker 0: better.".

1371
01:21:02,312 --> 01:21:03,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't have any details.

1372
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,544
Speaker 0: Maybe a fighting game using the characters?

1373
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:06,309
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1374
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:11,724
Speaker 0: There's going to be some sort of cell phone Final Fantasy XIII game.

1375
01:21:12,407 --> 01:21:13,490
Speaker 0: Don't ask me what that's about.

1376
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:17,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really can't imagine, unless maybe it's a mini-game in the game.

1377
01:21:17,871 --> 01:21:24,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're really, because Final Fantasy, the real Final Fantasy games, quote, are really the big thing that sell PlayStations.

1378
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:32,430
Speaker 0: I mean, the PlayStation 1 would have been another Dreamcast 3DO if it wasn't for Final Fantasy VII, and everybody knows it.

1379
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:37,150
Speaker 0: That's the only reason the PlayStation is so huge today, is because of Final Fantasy VII.

1380
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:45,470
Speaker 1: Just think, if Nintendo and Square had patched up and not been fighting, there's a chance Nintendo would have just continued to be the behemoth that it used to be.

1381
01:21:45,951 --> 01:21:48,362
Speaker 0: Yep, it was all Square Enix's fault.

1382
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:49,146
Speaker 0: 100%, everyone knows.

1383
01:21:50,530 --> 01:22:00,950
Speaker 0: So, now, since Final Fantasy seems to be the only thing they've got, and it was the thing that they started with, they're trying to make it as big as possible and milk it for everything they got.

1384
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:06,350
Speaker 0: You know, I mean, they got Metal Gear also, but that's really not much.

1385
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,516
Speaker 1: We didn't see any gameplay.

1386
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:09,930
Speaker 1: We just saw a woman shoot a bunch of people with an Uzi.

1387
01:22:10,372 --> 01:22:10,548
Speaker 0: Yep.

1388
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:11,312
Speaker 1: That's it?

1389
01:22:12,196 --> 01:22:14,730
Speaker 1: Oh, and there was a train going through a futuristic smog-filled city.

1390
01:22:15,316 --> 01:22:16,468
Speaker 0: Sounds like Final Fantasy to me.

1391
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:17,136
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1392
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:24,784
Speaker 0: So, whether Final Fantasy XIII is good or not, I mean, didn't a bunch of people complain about the Final Fantasy XII?

1393
01:22:24,824 --> 01:22:26,448
Speaker 0: We still don't have that over here, do we?

1394
01:22:26,749 --> 01:22:27,110
Speaker 0: Or do we?

1395
01:22:27,453 --> 01:22:27,847
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1396
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,290
Speaker 0: That was the one that came out in Japan, and the combat was different, right?

1397
01:22:32,393 --> 01:22:34,030
Speaker 1: The last Final Fantasy, I played.

1398
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:39,930
Speaker 0: 11 was the MMO, 12 was the one with the weird combat that scored a perfect score in Famitsu.

1399
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:45,069
Speaker 1: 9 was the nod to old school, 8 was the one that was just a movie, 7 was the bridge.

1400
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:49,373
Speaker 0: So, is 12 out in the US?

1401
01:22:49,393 --> 01:22:50,074
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

1402
01:22:50,274 --> 01:22:59,970
Speaker 0: The fact that there isn't a whole lot of crazy talk about Final Fantasy XII since it came out in Japan, at least not that I've heard on any major gaming, you know, general gaming sites.

1403
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:06,465
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe this isn't going to, you know, are people less interested in Final Fantasy now?

1404
01:23:06,485 --> 01:23:07,608
Speaker 0: Are they still crazy about it?

1405
01:23:07,769 --> 01:23:08,070
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1406
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:12,587
Speaker 1: Now one thing that we noticed, who was it who said the thing about female protagonists?

1407
01:23:12,828 --> 01:23:13,450
Speaker 1: Was that Joystick?

1408
01:23:13,711 --> 01:23:14,710
Speaker 0: I don't know, with some site.

1409
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:19,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, some people said that, wow, a Final Fantasy game with a female protagonist.

1410
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:21,489
Speaker 0: Obviously you haven't played Final Fantasy VI.

1411
01:23:21,950 --> 01:23:27,890
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy VI, the two primary protagonists, the two mainest of main characters, are women.

1412
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:35,890
Speaker 0: In fact, the first character you see in the game is a woman, not counting the two nobodies that she's with.

1413
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:41,870
Speaker 1: The first half of the game, you follow one woman around most of the game doing things, and she is definitely the plot mover.

1414
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:47,050
Speaker 1: Then, the game changes up, and now you follow this other woman through the whole game.

1415
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:57,649
Speaker 0: Final Fantasy VI, I guess it's just, in Final Fantasy VI, if you are short-sighted, you can see, uh, what's the guy?

1416
01:23:57,709 --> 01:23:57,970
Speaker 0: Locke?

1417
01:23:58,371 --> 01:23:59,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, Locke and Edgar.

1418
01:23:59,871 --> 01:24:07,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can look at them, because Final Fantasy VI didn't have, no one character really stood out super strongly above the others.

1419
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:11,010
Speaker 0: You're right in that, uh, what's her name, the Esper girl.

1420
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:12,829
Speaker 0: Spoiler!

1421
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:13,682
Speaker 0: Oh no!

1422
01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:14,714
Speaker 1: Oh no!

1423
01:24:14,936 --> 01:24:16,750
Speaker 1: We have a funny story about that for another day.

1424
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:18,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's for another, well, we should do a day on spoilers.

1425
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:19,650
Speaker 0: We should.

1426
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:20,228
Speaker 0: Okay, so.

1427
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:26,470
Speaker 1: But, Terra was, I mean, she was the main character if you look at it from like a literary work of art way.

1428
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:31,890
Speaker 0: That's correct, but she wasn't so incredibly more main than the other characters.

1429
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:39,830
Speaker 0: Like, if you watch an anime like Trigun, Vash the Stampede is so more main than anyone else in the show.

1430
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:58,450
Speaker 0: But if you watch a show like Gundam Seed Destiny, from what I've heard, so this is probably not the best example, but from what I've heard, in Gundam Seed Destiny, there's a guy who's supposedly the main character, but the characters in the old Gundam Seed come around and they're more main and it's hard to tell.

1431
01:24:59,434 --> 01:25:00,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, so.

1432
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:08,250
Speaker 1: Of course, in the second half of Final Fantasy VI, there's no doubt one character is the only force in the game at that point.

1433
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:08,599
Speaker 0: Yep.

1434
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:11,750
Speaker 1: And everyone else is just side characters until the final movies.

1435
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:19,749
Speaker 0: So, Final Fantasy XIII, however, it seems that there's going to be one female who is as main as Cloud was in Final Fantasy VII.

1436
01:25:20,713 --> 01:25:24,349
Speaker 0: Which I guess that's kind of a first if you don't count non-.

1437
01:25:24,570 --> 01:25:27,110
Speaker 0: Well, Final Fantasy X2 was all girls, right?

1438
01:25:27,735 --> 01:25:28,188
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1439
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:29,370
Speaker 0: I guess, that's what I heard.

1440
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:34,430
Speaker 1: So I guess if you don't count the second half of Final Fantasy VI, then they're kinda right.

1441
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:35,245
Speaker 0: Kinda.

1442
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:40,090
Speaker 0: But yeah, a female protagonist is not a big deal unless you're a perverted fan.

1443
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:43,650
Speaker 1: Now here's the thing, I don't think that they made the distinction like we did.

1444
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:47,729
Speaker 1: I think they just didn't remember or know about Final Fantasy VI.

1445
01:25:48,236 --> 01:25:48,430
Speaker 1: Maybe.

1446
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:49,449
Speaker 1: I think they're just young punks.

1447
01:25:49,773 --> 01:25:51,147
Speaker 0: They seem to remember about IV and V.

1448
01:25:53,472 --> 01:25:56,730
Speaker 1: Not many people remember V because V was not available until recently.

1449
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:57,763
Speaker 0: That's true.

1450
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:03,950
Speaker 1: In fact, I got a ROM of V a long time ago that I played and it was like this crazy deal.

1451
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:08,710
Speaker 1: Like I went around my school with CD-ROMs with it, giving it to people.

1452
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:10,626
Speaker 1: They were like, "Oh my god, where did you get

1453
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:10,868
Speaker 1: this?".

1454
01:26:11,278 --> 01:26:11,405
Speaker 0: Yep.

1455
01:26:12,391 --> 01:26:14,830
Speaker 0: Alright, I think we're done Sony bashing.

1456
01:26:15,894 --> 01:26:17,069
Speaker 0: Let's talk about the Wii.

1457
01:26:18,271 --> 01:26:24,046
Speaker 1: Alright, we've gone on for about an hour and a half here and we've got at least another hour to talk about E3.

1458
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:31,150
Speaker 0: I really don't mind finishing off and making a crazy long episode, but RIM is wussing out.

1459
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:32,350
Speaker 1: No, it's more than one.

1460
01:26:33,172 --> 01:26:35,090
Speaker 1: Our listeners always say they want longer episodes.

1461
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:41,410
Speaker 1: I don't think they would listen to all of it or they would generally be annoyed if we put out a three hour episode.

1462
01:26:42,751 --> 01:26:47,548
Speaker 0: I say if they want longer episodes, we should give them what they want and then see whether they like it or not.

1463
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:49,229
Speaker 0: You don't know until you try.

1464
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:53,466
Speaker 1: Nah, it's also a pain in the ass because it's hard to upload things to Libsyn that are that big.

1465
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,509
Speaker 0: That's true.

1466
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:55,110
Speaker 0: That's true.

1467
01:26:55,830 --> 01:27:00,890
Speaker 1: And it's late and while I wouldn't normally be tired because I'm actually skipping work tomorrow anyway.

1468
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,050
Speaker 0: You're skipping work tomorrow?

1469
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,816
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a dentist appointment and a doctor's appointment and an appointment with my new job.

1470
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:06,670
Speaker 1: Awesome.

1471
01:27:06,811 --> 01:27:07,949
Speaker 1: I'm going into work for like an hour.

1472
01:27:08,496 --> 01:27:08,750
Speaker 0: Awesome.

1473
01:27:09,655 --> 01:27:10,490
Speaker 1: I might not even go at all.

1474
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:11,069
Speaker 1: I'm not sure yet.

1475
01:27:11,272 --> 01:27:11,970
Speaker 0: I wouldn't go at all.

1476
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:14,350
Speaker 1: It's more that I, well, you know, we'll ask you.

1477
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:16,370
Speaker 1: We're going to do the rest of this show on Thursday.

1478
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:16,453
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1479
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:31,725
Speaker 0: So for anyone who subscribes to just the Tuesday podcast, you need to come to frontroadcrew.com on Thursday if you want to hear us talk about the Wii and Microsoft and what they had to say.

1480
01:27:32,431 --> 01:27:41,129
Speaker 1: I may put it in a category so that it'll show up in both days, but I'm really leery of doing that and I probably won't end up actually doing that.

1481
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:47,870
Speaker 0: So Thursday you'll hear the rest of this episode and it's not, remember it was all rim.

1482
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:51,222
Speaker 0: So if you wanted a three hour podcast, let us know.

1483
01:27:51,242 --> 01:27:57,130
Speaker 0: if you wanted to three hour podcast, put all your blame on rim for not doing it and I'll take it.

1484
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:59,570
Speaker 0: Tell him how, uh, you know, we'll see.

1485
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:00,667
Speaker 0: He is for not doing it.

1486
01:28:01,090 --> 01:28:06,030
Speaker 0: If you didn't want the three hour podcast, say, come and tell us that, Hey, rim was right.

1487
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:07,630
Speaker 0: We didn't want a three hour podcast.

1488
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:19,509
Speaker 1: I can't wait till Thursday because basically I just worry that if it's that long, I mean, it either maybe people with small MP3 players love trouble with it or downloading it for people with not the greatest connections love trouble.

1489
01:28:20,976 --> 01:28:21,310
Speaker 0: Maybe.

1490
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:23,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are plenty of, I don't know.

1491
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:25,949
Speaker 0: I wonder what the longest podcast ever is.

1492
01:28:26,611 --> 01:28:28,230
Speaker 1: I'm going to break the freaking record dude.

1493
01:28:28,899 --> 01:28:29,288
Speaker 1: You know what?

1494
01:28:29,611 --> 01:28:31,790
Speaker 1: If there is a record, I could easily break it.

1495
01:28:31,871 --> 01:28:33,570
Speaker 1: I can generate infinite data.

1496
01:28:34,094 --> 01:28:34,183
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1497
01:28:34,491 --> 01:28:40,590
Speaker 1: I could probably make a thing that if you connected to it, it would just constantly stream audio to you forever.

1498
01:28:41,414 --> 01:28:41,477
Speaker 0: Hmm.

1499
01:28:42,574 --> 01:28:43,828
Speaker 1: That would be fairly trivial to do.

1500
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:45,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, but would it count as a podcast?

1501
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:53,689
Speaker 1: I don't know, but actually I will spend some time tomorrow looking into how, how people with really, really, really long podcasts deal with it.

1502
01:28:54,713 --> 01:28:54,804
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1503
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:57,050
Speaker 0: I haven't really seen any podcasts long.

1504
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:00,750
Speaker 0: I think the longest podcast I've ever seen is like an hour and 40 minutes.

1505
01:29:01,352 --> 01:29:03,870
Speaker 1: And we're getting, we're getting, we're getting somewhat close to that already.

1506
01:29:04,858 --> 01:29:05,130
Speaker 0: Okay.

1507
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:09,770
Speaker 1: So it's kind of a, I don't want to suddenly foist a giant one on you if it'll cause problems.

1508
01:29:11,094 --> 01:29:11,850
Speaker 1: That's my rationale.

1509
01:29:13,131 --> 01:29:27,970
Speaker 0: So for everyone so desperate to hear what Rym and Scott have to say about the Wii and the Microsoft and everything Microsoft had to say about Vista and the Xbox 360 and the rest of their games, you're going to have to wait till Thursday because Rym's a wuss.

1510
01:29:28,774 --> 01:29:29,368
Speaker 1: Eh, we'll see.

1511
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:32,090
Speaker 1: We'll see what they have to say, whether they think it was a good idea or not.

1512
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:35,428
Speaker 0: We'll see if they're even still listening at this point, but then I guess we know the answer, don't we?

1513
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:35,823
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1514
01:29:36,691 --> 01:29:45,150
Speaker 0: So, you know how you want to tell us, you want to send an email to geekknights@frontrowcrew.com or an audio feedback to that email, which we may or may not play.

1515
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:53,089
Speaker 0: Or you want to go to frontrowcrew.com/forum and join our forum, or if you're already joined in it, post stuff.

1516
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:58,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, the forum's rocking and one, I'd like to give a general shout out to all the new people who have joined in the last like week.

1517
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:00,570
Speaker 0: Yay, forums.

1518
01:30:01,331 --> 01:30:03,690
Speaker 0: They're having fun and constant discussions.

1519
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:04,419
Speaker 1: Yep.

1520
01:30:04,891 --> 01:30:11,110
Speaker 1: So, once again, Thursday we'll continue with the Wii and at least an hour of talking about that, probably.

1521
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:11,557
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1522
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:17,590
Speaker 1: I mean, we have a lot to say, but the nice overview will be simply that the Wii is awesome.

1523
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:22,308
Speaker 1: They didn't say all the things we wanted them to say information-wise, but they still said a lot.

1524
01:30:23,192 --> 01:30:24,050
Speaker 1: It was very impressive.

1525
01:30:24,772 --> 01:30:27,229
Speaker 1: The Xbox was more impressive than you would expect.

1526
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:41,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, considering that my Xbox 360 came out last year and last E3 was their big announce, they managed to add enough to it in this E3 to make me more interested in what they had to say than what Sony had to say.

1527
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:46,590
Speaker 0: And that's pretty good, considering it's Microsoft, who I generally don't like on principle.

1528
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:49,390
Speaker 1: This Shadowrun game, I want to talk a lot about.

1529
01:30:49,691 --> 01:30:51,570
Speaker 0: Alright, we'll talk about Shadowrun next week.

1530
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:52,490
Speaker 0: Two days from now.

1531
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:53,229
Speaker 1: Two days from now.

1532
01:30:54,271 --> 01:31:01,910
Speaker 0: So, go out and read a bunch of E3 news and that way, when you listen to us on Thursday, it'll all be old news to you and boring.

1533
01:31:02,091 --> 01:31:08,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, if nothing else though, watch what Nintendo did, if you can get to it still, because YouTube and everyone is having trouble.

1534
01:31:08,651 --> 01:31:09,529
Speaker 1: Since everyone's watching it.

1535
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:12,010
Speaker 1: Watch Nintendo's thing, because we're going to talk about it.

1536
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:13,270
Speaker 0: Go watch all three conferences.

1537
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:19,310
Speaker 0: Watch the Sony conference, the Nintendo conference, and the Microsoft conference.

1538
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:33,790
Speaker 0: Pay attention to the responses of the crowds, the quality of the production on stage, and how excited it makes you, the things that they're showing, and what the things that they're actually showing and saying mean for real.

1539
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:35,949
Speaker 0: That's what you have to pay attention to.

1540
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:42,390
Speaker 0: Don't get wowed over by, you know, CG renderings of demos that aren't actual games.

1541
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:46,110
Speaker 1: I don't think they'll be wowed over by some suits talking about shipping numbers.

1542
01:31:46,311 --> 01:31:46,728
Speaker 0: No, they won't.

1543
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:48,450
Speaker 0: Okay?

1544
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:55,610
Speaker 1: Yep, and don't forget to let us know about the long episode thing, because I'm actually curious now as to what the feelings of our general listenership are.

1545
01:31:56,273 --> 01:31:56,466
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1546
01:31:57,713 --> 01:32:02,747
Speaker 0: I don't think we're going to have too many opportunities to do a long episode, except maybe a year from now at the next E3.

1547
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:03,563
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1548
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:05,568
Speaker 0: Or maybe an Otacon episode, but...

1549
01:32:05,790 --> 01:32:06,750
Speaker 1: Otacon's going to be easy.

1550
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:07,810
Speaker 1: We're just going to have Otacon Week.

1551
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:08,490
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1552
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:11,369
Speaker 1: Monday will be the video games, or the tech at Otacon.

1553
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:13,210
Speaker 1: Tuesday will be the video games at Otacon.

1554
01:32:13,291 --> 01:32:14,749
Speaker 0: You want to do a theme week next week?

1555
01:32:15,412 --> 01:32:16,329
Speaker 1: Oh, what theme should we do?

1556
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:17,410
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1557
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:19,630
Speaker 0: There's a robot theme I thought about.

1558
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:25,029
Speaker 1: All right, anyone who's still listening, right now suggest themes to us, and we'll, whatever...

1559
01:32:25,431 --> 01:32:27,670
Speaker 0: Next week is going to be a theme week, for sure.

1560
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,750
Speaker 1: And it'll be a listener pick.

1561
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:32,390
Speaker 1: We'll pick it, but we'll pick something that you guys suggest.

1562
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:32,859
Speaker 0: Yep.

1563
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:40,228
Speaker 0: So, if you suggest something on the forums, or by email, we are going to pick a suggested theme for next week.

1564
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:41,385
Speaker 0: Ooh!

1565
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:42,000
Speaker 0: Ooh!

1566
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:42,915
Speaker 0: Wee!

1567
01:32:45,116 --> 01:32:45,448
Speaker 0: Xbox!

1568
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:47,175
Speaker 0: Wee!

1569
01:32:56,674 --> 01:32:58,750
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1570
01:32:59,052 --> 01:33:01,389
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

1571
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:06,209

Speaker 1: Geek Nights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

1577
01:33:24,993 --> 01:33:28,210
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio, and no audience.

1578
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:32,110
Speaker 0: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
