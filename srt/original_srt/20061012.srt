Speaker 0: I think we're channeling the ghosts of didn't get enough sleep started recording the episode too late ate a lot of food and Then had a busy day.

37
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,704
Speaker 0: I am me.

38
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:13,351

Speaker 0: We'll just mention every other podcast in the world.

40
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:17,246
Speaker 1: That's really a podcast reference.

41
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:19,954
Speaker 1: I think that's more of a British podcast pointer.

42
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,037
Speaker 0: alright alright.

43
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:21,739
Speaker 1: It's a bit shit.

44
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:26,132
Speaker 1: So you know I wait weather's crappy and you find this tree.

45
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:31,920
Speaker 1: Yeah our way to ruin my story I know right alright, so I'm at work, and I'm wandering around.

46
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:37,700
Speaker 1: I'm at the bottom tip of the Bronx like Manhattan is right there, and I'm working on some stuff.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,069
Speaker 1: And I'm dressed up really nice cuz I was meeting with a client.

48
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:42,860
Speaker 1: so you know I'm wearing really nice like business professional.

49
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:53,049
Speaker 1: I got a little messenger bag, and I got all my paperwork And I am a stuffy looking white-collar businessman, and I walk out of the place I was working and I'm walking toward my car.

50
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,957
Speaker 1: I parked a couple blocks away on like 227th Street.

51
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:06,204
Speaker 1: As I'm walking I pass a park And there's a perfect climbing tree the same kind of tree that I had in my front yard when I was in high school But pretty much the best climbing tree.

52
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:13,070
Speaker 1: I'd seen in a long time, and I look around and There's a no one watching me.

53
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:15,500
Speaker 1: the streets empty because it's like one o'clock.

54
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,348
Speaker 1: So I drop all my stuff.

55
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,283
Speaker 1: I unbuttoned the top top couple buttons in my shirt I untuck it.

56
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,233
Speaker 1: I jump up, and I climb that goddamn tree.

57
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:29,104
Speaker 1: I climbed like 20 feet of the air now one.

58
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:48,199
Speaker 1: I would like to point out that I am a little bit older than I was the last time I climbed a tree and I don't feel really slower, or you know starting to wear down in any real way But I can tell you that my body felt a lot heavier and a lot more fragile Than it used to when I was climbing that tree.

59
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:56,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, I noticed that too when I was a kid I used to be like jump down a jillion stairs And I do all kinds of crazy stuff.

60
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,695
Speaker 0: Nowadays, I'll like a jump that when I was a kid would have been no problem.

61
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:01,996
Speaker 0: now.

62
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:07,174
Speaker 1: I look at it like Yeah, I got to the top, and I remember thinking you know if I fall.

63
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:08,740
Speaker 1: I'll probably die.

64
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:15,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, so then you know I climb back down, and I I'd like jump off the last the second to last branch.

65
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:22,320
Speaker 1: I catch the last branch I swing back and forth a bunch of times And then I land and I think all right I can get on with my businessman life.

66
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:26,063
Speaker 1: Then I hear the clapping The clapping.

67
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:29,353
Speaker 0: you say so I turn around screw you and give you the clap.

68
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:33,588
Speaker 1: that was the dumbest joke I've ever heard anyone.

69
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:36,420
Speaker 0: That's the kind of joke that's gonna come out when I'm tired on a Thursday.

70
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:38,291
Speaker 1: I see I'm not that tired.

71
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,840
Speaker 1: I'm pretty tired all right.

72
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:51,633
Speaker 1: So there's this dude in a wheelchair this old man, and he's clapping And he wheels over to me, and he puts his hand up And he says man you just made my day, and he rolls his wheelchair away.

73
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:53,460
Speaker 1: Just laughing as hard as he can.

74
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,918
Speaker 0: So I that's an awesome dude.

75
00:04:56,121 --> 00:05:03,638
Speaker 1: So I rebuttened up my you know Businessman shirt and I pick up my businessman briefcase and I walk back to my car and drive back to my office in Yonkers.

76
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,050
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, today.

77
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,980
Speaker 0: I actually I have worked.

78
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:08,057
Speaker 0: I got work to do.

79
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:11,826
Speaker 0: They're launching this site on Saturday and I have to.

80
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:15,160
Speaker 0: I had an application that I wrote that I have to integrate into the site.

81
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:17,439
Speaker 0: And you know what I learned from working today.

82
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,249
Speaker 0: See I was worried that from not working for so long.

83
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:26,811
Speaker 0: You know just sitting at work not doing anything and that You know I lost my skills of working.

84
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:30,517
Speaker 1: and then you know I worry that occasionally I'll be at work, and I'll be like then.

85
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:34,267
Speaker 0: today I worked for maybe an hour And I got so much crazy shit done.

86
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:40,787
Speaker 0: if I actually worked eight hours a day of actually working Do you know how much shit I would do?

87
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:45,480
Speaker 0: I'd probably die from doing that, but yeah, I would do so much crap.

88
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,352
Speaker 0: It would be insane, so I don't know am I?

89
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,319
Speaker 0: I'm feeling in the mood of working yet I think I might start producing work soon.

90
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe you won't though.

91
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,173
Speaker 1: I have this feeling you won't no.

92
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:58,625
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna at least tomorrow I am for sure.

93
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:09,740
Speaker 0: another thing is I started As I was looking around on dig and there was some website that said to take a picture every day And I have a digital camera that I don't use enough, so I said why the hell not?

94
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:18,184
Speaker 0: So if you pay attention to my flicker, I'm gonna take one photo every day from now on all right yep We'll see.

95
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:22,119
Speaker 1: cuz I had a vision as to what kind of pictures Scott was gonna be taking.

96
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:28,933
Speaker 0: well The idea is to try to take a picture that sort of sums up your day So you can look at the picture and then remember that day.

97
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:32,247
Speaker 1: I imagine 365.25 pictures of a phallus.

98
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:41,460
Speaker 0: No, no the first picture is actually picture of the phone on my desk at work because I had a conference call today.

99
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,808
Speaker 0: That was pretty much the height of my day.

100
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:46,678
Speaker 0: Wow it was the last time I ever used that phone at work.

101
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,646
Speaker 0: never That never used the phone.

102
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,550
Speaker 1: that was the height of your.

103
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:50,655
Speaker 1: I climbed a tree.

104
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:53,646
Speaker 0: never use the phone at work So it's like a strange thing to use it.

105
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,477
Speaker 1: I climbed a tree, and you took a picture of a telephone.

106
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:59,386
Speaker 1: yep Right so in the news.

107
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:02,660
Speaker 1: I don't know much to say about this, but there's been a lot of talk.

108
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,358
Speaker 1: I mean we've been bashing blu-ray and HD DVD and a lot of people have been saying it'll do poorly.

109
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:25,421
Speaker 1: and a lot of people Have been saying that we're just really pessimistic, and I'd like to note that as of the most recent sales figures The sale of blu-ray and HD DVD devices has fallen a bit short of the projected sales And by a bit I mean more than 60%.

110
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:26,505
Speaker 0: That's not unexpected.

111
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:30,860
Speaker 0: who the hell has an HDTV and who the hell's gonna shell out a hajillion dollars to one of these players?

112
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:36,211
Speaker 1: Practically no one has bought HD equipment for blu-ray or HD.

113
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:37,937
Speaker 0: you know who's buying most of the equipment?

114
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:38,640
Speaker 0: no one.

115
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:42,495
Speaker 0: Gadget review websites like in gadget and gizmodo and even better.

116
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:43,620
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna read magazines.

117
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:46,876
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna read into this very much because there's really.

118
00:07:46,896 --> 00:08:03,399
Speaker 1: I mean I'm not sure exactly how they got these numbers But they say that they expect game consoles that are equipped to play blu-ray or HD DVD To make up 1 million of the 1.7 million devices that will be sold before the end of the year.

119
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:07,840
Speaker 1: now Didn't Sony say they're gonna have 2 million PlayStation threes?

120
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:09,087
Speaker 0: I don't know.

121
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:10,073
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe not?

122
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:12,103
Speaker 1: so yeah They did so.

123
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:17,359
Speaker 1: how come the industry here is saying that they expect 1 million to be sold?

124
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:19,276
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

125
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,121
Speaker 0: They don't.

126
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:24,255
Speaker 0: is also supposedly gonna be some HD DVD thing on the 360?

127
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,720
Speaker 0: who knows it's up in the air.

128
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,185
Speaker 1: That was pretty much a rumor so far.

129
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:29,112
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're gonna see what comes of that.

130
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:30,035
Speaker 0: It's craziness.

131
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:30,758
Speaker 0: probably nothing.

132
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,183
Speaker 0: probably I have.

133
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:44,235
Speaker 0: there might be a chance that they'll sell Xbox 360 the HD DVD players or they'll sell like a replacement disk drive for it and I don't know if they're gonna put games exclusively on HD DVD though.

134
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,500
Speaker 0: That's that's a long shot.

135
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:50,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I was gonna do the news about the correlation between being fat and being dumb.

136
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:51,620
Speaker 0: What happened to that news?

137
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,200
Speaker 1: I'm gonna use that Monday, so you can all stew about it over the weekend all right.

138
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:59,652
Speaker 0: So my news isn't really in news, but it's pretty cool.

139
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:07,726
Speaker 0: the guy who made bit torrent Bram Cohen Right he was talking about Share ratios.

140
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:20,892
Speaker 0: you see there are a lot of bit torrent trackers And what those track and these are basically run by people who have the same logic as the olden day IRC f-serves which I guess still exist in a lot of places.

141
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:29,948
Speaker 0: and the logic was you know This is a or the hotline servers also remember those you ran one of the most popular anime hotline servers out there.

142
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:40,880
Speaker 0: I did and then I got rid of it cuz hotline died, but Basically the way those servers worked was you would download files from the server But in order to get files you had to upload new files.

143
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:52,326
Speaker 0: So if you ran a server that would had a lot of files to begin with you were going to get a lot of more New files and it was basically saying hey if you were the kind of person who uploads to me Then you can get from me.

144
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:53,131
Speaker 1: you want to know how.

145
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:58,110
Speaker 0: I make sure there was a fair shake Especially back in the days of rename the same file upload it.

146
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,105
Speaker 1: no no no much simpler than that in the days of FTP file servers mm-hmm.

147
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:11,295
Speaker 1: I made a file that was 1.8 gigabytes And I would just set that to upload for a while and then I download everything I wanted.

148
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:12,700
Speaker 1: then I never connected that site again.

149
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, no, but a lot of bit torrent trackers have are setting share ratio monitors.

150
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:29,950
Speaker 0: What they do is they say hey if you're only downloading and then closing right away instead of sticking around and uploading Then we're gonna kick you off of our you know torrent trackers.

151
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,214
Speaker 0: You can't get our stuff anymore.

152
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:31,876
Speaker 1: That's fine.

153
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:32,478
Speaker 1: Whatever?

154
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:40,600
Speaker 0: well Those people are complaining because now people are you getting bit torrent clients that?

155
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:48,588
Speaker 0: Falsely report how much they are uploading and downloading so that they don't get banned by trackers Even if they do things the right way.

156
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,059
Speaker 1: oh fine, whatever it was a self-correcting situation right?

157
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,148
Speaker 0: so Bram Cohen you know what they'd happened.

158
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:58,716
Speaker 0: is the people running those trackers right?

159
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:05,880
Speaker 0: we're complaining that They need to change the bit torrent protocol so people can't lie about how much they're uploading and downloading.

160
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:07,244
Speaker 1: Let me guess.

161
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:11,496
Speaker 1: my guess here is that mr.. Bit torrent gave them the double-deuce.

162
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,800
Speaker 0: Oh he gave him the triple-deuce.

163
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,550
Speaker 0: He's like you know what if you weren't banning people?

164
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,597
Speaker 0: they wouldn't need to be lying in the first place.

165
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:21,912
Speaker 0: and also You're banning based on share ratio is completely stupid.

166
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:24,240
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with bit torrent the way it is.

167
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,052
Speaker 0: You don't need to force people to seed you know.

168
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:31,654
Speaker 0: and then he goes on to talk about how You know when someone if there's a new torrent.

169
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:35,091
Speaker 0: That's hot right There's gonna be a lot of whoever's uploading it.

170
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:55,760
Speaker 0: at that point the few uploaders are gonna Have a lot of upload activity and then in the middle of the torrent You know there's gonna be you know really hot activity on both ends and then towards the end if Someone comes in to download at that point They're gonna get the file really quick because there'll be a bunch of cedars and no one else downloading because it's it's already done.

171
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:02,520
Speaker 0: So people coming in late to a torrent we get shafted by these idiots who don't know how to run their trackers.

172
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,219
Speaker 0: and those are the people who get banned just because they came late to a torrent.

173
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:10,560
Speaker 0: and You know people wouldn't get to upload so much by that point.

174
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:14,597
Speaker 0: And he's like you shouldn't ban people from your tracker based on share ratios.

175
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:15,380
Speaker 0: blah blah blah blah blah.

176
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:15,874
Speaker 0: He's right.

177
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:16,100
Speaker 0: well

178
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:30,180
Speaker 1: I gotta say back in the days of winmx if I was at my computer I'd periodically look cuz I let a lot of people download from me And I had a lot of stuff And I just watch and anyone who was downloading slowly I would just kick them off so other people could get my stuff.

179
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:31,013
Speaker 0: That's what I would do.

180
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:36,980
Speaker 0: also You know if you someone was downloading too much stuff, or they were too much was fine.

181
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:45,812
Speaker 1: Well, no too much at once like I like that exclusion of other people trying to get in there You could set up filters that prevented that automatically and queued people up.

182
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:47,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I try, but it was always kind of tricky.

183
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,533
Speaker 0: Ah, it didn't always work.

184
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:55,880
Speaker 0: for some reason I can always inevitably get one guy downloading a thousand things at once or like queuing up a thousand things.

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,775
Speaker 0: And it was annoying especially when I wanted to close winmx and play a game.

186
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,140
Speaker 1: see I would just close winmx.

187
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:07,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but you know the point is is people try to you know deal with these digital.

188
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,477
Speaker 0: You know p2p sharing as if it's a trade.

189
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:11,899
Speaker 0: They're like.

190
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:13,064
Speaker 0: You know.

191
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:23,487
Speaker 0: they try to force people you know like to know and take equally You know like they keep trying to force people to give and take equally to force Fair sharing.

192
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:26,377
Speaker 0: all bit torrent is designed to share fairly by default.

193
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:27,260
Speaker 0: You don't need to do anything.

194
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:28,599
Speaker 1: This has always been around.

195
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:34,925
Speaker 1: This is the same people who beg and beg and beg and whine at IRC to be given up And then they lord it over people.

196
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:38,737
Speaker 1: the same people who care how many MP3 files they have.

197
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:44,365
Speaker 1: The same people who care if they got the zero day wares Because it makes them cool.

198
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:52,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I'm glad that the Bram Cohen bit torrent guy has given them the shaft But on the other hand you know it does show.

199
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:56,340
Speaker 0: the one weakness of open source is that idiots are inevitably going.

200
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:58,180
Speaker 0: You know bit torrents open source.

201
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:05,320
Speaker 0: There are a lot of bit torrent clients and tracker softwares out there that it that allow them to do things this asshat way.

202
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:06,665
Speaker 1: Well what I mean?

203
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:08,333
Speaker 1: a lying about your share ratio, whatever.

204
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:09,076
Speaker 1: that doesn't mean any.

205
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:15,218
Speaker 1: no no no also You know banning people based on Sherry that that really only has to do with the tracker and not the client.

206
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,383
Speaker 0: yeah Well, it's.

207
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:19,699
Speaker 0: it's both of those things combined and neither one of them should really exist.

208
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:27,240
Speaker 1: so your point was because Open-source exists people might use open source code to do things that you don't agree with personally.

209
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:30,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay that could end up harming me.

210
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,737
Speaker 0: You know I want to get a file, but it's the server's run by assets.

211
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,500
Speaker 1: so now I can't get it, but you just get it anyway you deal with the assets, and then you take their stuff.

212
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,034
Speaker 1: I don't deal with assets, okay, then how you gonna get stuff that assets have?

213
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:43,460
Speaker 0: I'm gonna kick their ass.

214
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,510
Speaker 1: I mean if you ever actually well kick their hat.

215
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,460
Speaker 1: I don't think you've ever actually run into this problem.

216
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,030
Speaker 1: No, you've never run into a file.

217
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,080
Speaker 1: You couldn't get because someone was being an asshat.

218
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,105
Speaker 1: It's a fake problem.

219
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:54,934
Speaker 0: You made a straw man problems.

220
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:56,744
Speaker 0: It could happen It didn't.

221
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,980
Speaker 0: that's cuz I don't hang around those sleazy places getting sleazy files.

222
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's mostly like porno, but torrent trackers I Imagine where's bit torrent trackers?

223
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:08,413
Speaker 0: no one else actually cares about that shit.

224
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, so where do you get your porn anyway?

225
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:15,315
Speaker 0: No, and then thinking about it getting it from a new place so where he been getting it?

226
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:16,882
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

227
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:18,271
Speaker 0: I'm looking for new places.

228
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:18,754
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

229
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:19,499
Speaker 1: You don't know?

230
00:15:20,363 --> 00:15:24,540
Speaker 1: How can you not know where your porn comes from unless you don't want to say the name of it because it's something.

231
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:32,213
Speaker 0: No, it's not really that weird that weird All right, so wait a minute.

232
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:33,100
Speaker 1: I gotta go back to this.

233
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,707
Speaker 0: Why don't we change the episode?

234
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:36,872
Speaker 1: Maybe instead of food?

235
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:38,580
Speaker 1: We'll talk about where Scott gets his porn.

236
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:43,240
Speaker 0: I don't know because there's a new website you porn calm which is like the YouTube of porn.

237
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,710
Speaker 0: I might go there, but it didn't work the last time I tried it.

238
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:49,079
Speaker 0: It was all crashing and freezing mm-hmm.

239
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,082
Speaker 0: We'll have to see if it's any better now.

240
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:59,010
Speaker 0: Oh, I got a good thing of the day.

241
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,259
Speaker 0: I was laughing pretty hysterically when I found out about it.

242
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,050
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, so do you know about lemon?

243
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:08,082
Speaker 1: That 24-hour race that's really really really really boring.

244
00:16:08,423 --> 00:16:09,025
Speaker 0: well lemon.

245
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:21,761
Speaker 0: I think it's a type of racing I don't know enough about it because I don't care about it But it's endurance racing where they race cars for a long time and they stop and switch drivers And it's all about going fast, but also not having your car break down.

246
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,728
Speaker 1: It's exactly as boring as it sounds.

247
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:27,320
Speaker 0: yeah It's not the most exciting race in the world, but whatever.

248
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:39,088
Speaker 0: but here these guys in California have a race that they run called 24 hours of lemons as in lemons as in lemon cars that are crappy.

249
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:46,215
Speaker 0: and Basically, it's a 24-hour endurance race for cars costing $500 or less.

250
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:51,050
Speaker 0: and this picture is just hilarious looking to these jalopies driving around his track.

251
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:59,568
Speaker 1: And then if you go to this site and read the fact it's even funnier I like how the purses they pay out at the end are paid entirely in nickels.

252
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:05,753
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like everything about this whole race is a complete joke like any Any place.

253
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,002
Speaker 0: they could possibly make something funny.

254
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:08,704
Speaker 0: They did like.

255
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:14,965
Speaker 0: halfway through the race Everyone in the grandstands votes on a car that gets just they're gonna crush it.

256
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:15,989
Speaker 0: they crush it right there.

257
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:18,108
Speaker 0: It's like no you suck you get crushed.

258
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:20,374
Speaker 0: And it's great.

259
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,869
Speaker 0: like on the instructions here, they're like the fact says will I die?

260
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:27,983
Speaker 0: Maybe safety equipment isn't included in the $500 car purchase price.

261
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:33,166
Speaker 0: You'll have kind of a fighting chance, but this isn't a brilliant thing to be doing.

262
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:33,910
Speaker 0: get used to it.

263
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:36,422
Speaker 0: It's like will my car die?

264
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:37,635
Speaker 0: oh almost definitely Yeah.

265
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:44,103
Speaker 0: And even if it survives on the track Halfway through the race one entry will be chosen by popular ballot for immediate crushing.

266
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:46,350
Speaker 0: could be yours heck it probably will be yours.

267
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:46,470
Speaker 0: be.

268
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:53,690
Speaker 0: The whole rules of this race read like a silly RPG book like it's paranoia or something.

269
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,920
Speaker 0: But it's a car race in California.

270
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,036
Speaker 0: man if I lived in California I would totally go this thing and probably race.

271
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:01,059
Speaker 0: that's so worth 500 bucks.

272
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,644
Speaker 0: I spent $500 on worse things.

273
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:12,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, almost definitely As you know drive around a track in a crappy car everyone else is driving a crappy car.

274
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,476
Speaker 0: You want to see how long you can go.

275
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:16,704
Speaker 0: you want to see how fast you can go?

276
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:18,550
Speaker 0: It's good stuff, right?

277
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,369
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day I stumbled upon this being you know bored at the end of the day at work.

278
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:27,745
Speaker 1: Someone now you might remember the old Mary Worth comic and newspapers.

279
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:28,066
Speaker 0: god.

280
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,110
Speaker 0: I hate all those comics.

281
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:33,329
Speaker 1: It's really a shitty comic and whoever does it is not a cool person at all.

282
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:47,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you ever if you read the newspaper comics There's the the generic really popular ones then there's some of the more Targeted ones and then there's the boring want to be serious ones Like soap operas of the old school.

283
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:54,900
Speaker 1: they're not really very serious because there's only three panels a day and No one can actually follow that plot.

284
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,650
Speaker 1: and if you do the plot is shite It's.

285
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:01,989
Speaker 0: it's no different than watching a soap opera on TV only watching such a small part of it.

286
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,798
Speaker 1: The worst part was mean the art was bad and everything.

287
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:14,269
Speaker 1: so a bunch of people got together and they filmed Mary Worth using the dialogue and the framing and the camera angles from the comic.

288
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:17,440
Speaker 1: and I got to say this is a little disturbing to watch.

289
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,790
Speaker 1: you might not want to watch this if you're alone at night.

290
00:19:20,352 --> 00:19:27,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, they did it all in black and white and they had the people stand in the poses that they were in the comic frames But not moving.

291
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:31,109
Speaker 0: it is and they put this eerie music on it, and it was kind of freaky.

292
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,104
Speaker 1: If you don't good God is Mary Worth terrible now.

293
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,510
Speaker 1: I would put out a bounty.

294
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,837
Speaker 0: What are those other ones like apartment 3g?

295
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, I will put out a bounty Thor.

296
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:43,249
Speaker 1: I will put out a bounty right now.

297
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:48,370
Speaker 1: Anyone who can find someone who earnestly enjoys Mary Worth?

298
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,843
Speaker 1: Get them in my contact get them on this show.

00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:54,789
Speaker 1: I guarantee it.

301
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,476
Speaker 0: Why don't we get the person who does it?

302
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:57,701
Speaker 0: I'm sure they're not busy.

303
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:00,090
Speaker 1: I don't know if they're even alive.

304
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:04,808
Speaker 1: It's probably just like a couple of syndicated dudes who were hired to keep it going or something.

305
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:06,840
Speaker 0: All right I'm gonna read the Wikipedia on it.

306
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:08,290
Speaker 1: Well, we're not gonna do that now.

307
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,170
Speaker 0: No, I'm not doing it right now, but I meant in the future because I don't care about the person who writes it.

308
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,933
Speaker 1: They do it for money.

309
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:16,830
Speaker 1: I want to hear from someone who reads it who reads that outer drivel.

310
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:18,876
Speaker 0: That's a very good question.

311
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:21,770
Speaker 1: I mean I can understand reading underwear pervert comics.

312
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:27,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do understand the underwear forever comics more than I understand Mary Worth.

313
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:28,970
Speaker 1: Plus I've liked a few underwear perverts.

314
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,176
Speaker 1: I mean Batman and you know Batman.

315
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,550
Speaker 0: It's a spider-man.

316
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,255
Speaker 1: No, I don't like spider-man.

317
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:37,319
Speaker 0: Well, it's spider-man.

318
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,462
Speaker 1: I like the spider-man movies.

319
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:40,569
Speaker 1: I hated every spider-man comic I've ever seen.

320
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:43,800
Speaker 0: It's most of them are suck, but there's some good ones.

321
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:46,311
Speaker 1: Yeah, give me one that's good and I'll try to read it All right.

322
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:51,690
Speaker 0: It's usually the ones where it's not actually like the main spider-man book.

323
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:57,868
Speaker 0: It's always like here's spider-man and he's just hanging around town doing something funny cuz he's spider-man.

324
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:59,485
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Those are the ones that I like.

325
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:01,469
Speaker 0: anyway All right.

326
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:10,967
Speaker 0: So today we're gonna talk about I guess we're gonna argue about food because rim Doesn't like yogurt or milk because he's a heathen and Scott doesn't like anything.

327
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:14,682
Speaker 0: That's good All right, all right.

328
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,257
Speaker 1: So let's start with cream of wheat.

329
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:19,484
Speaker 1: cuz Scott for some reason will eat cream of wheat.

330
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:27,330
Speaker 0: cream of wheat is awesome If it's cold in the winter, you know, you don't want to have a bowl of dry cereal with some cold milk.

331
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,577
Speaker 0: You don't want to eat some cold fruit.

332
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:34,394
Speaker 0: you want to get some nice hot mushy cream of wheat And you don't need oatmeal.

333
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:38,230
Speaker 0: oatmeal is all clumpy and nasty and you know, you want like Quaker oats.

334
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,379
Speaker 0: That's even nastier.

335
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:40,870
Speaker 0: You gotta have cream of wheat.

336
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,198
Speaker 0: It's creamy and weedy and not only that.

337
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:48,850
Speaker 0: but you freakin put some milk and some sugar and some raisins in there.

338
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:52,943
Speaker 1: It's good stuff man, but cream of wheat doesn't taste like anything.

339
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:54,830
Speaker 1: It's the second blandest thing in the world.

340
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:58,249
Speaker 0: That's why you put the sugar and the raisins and the milk in it.

341
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:04,570
Speaker 1: Why not just eat sugar raisins and milk because then it wouldn't be a hot cereal and heat it up?

342
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:07,859
Speaker 0: If I tend to not you need the highest.

343
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,770
Speaker 0: it's mostly the hot mushy part and it does taste like something.

344
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:12,094
Speaker 0: It tastes like wheat.

345
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:14,402
Speaker 0: It's like eating five you're talking about.

346
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:17,030
Speaker 0: like hearty bread doesn't get any hardier than cream of wheat.

347
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:18,950
Speaker 0: It's like eating five pieces of bread.

348
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,488
Speaker 1: It gets much harder than cream of wheat because cream of wheat is the most processed white bread.

349
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,854
Speaker 0: crap It's not.

350
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:26,862
Speaker 0: you got to get the kind with all the yellow bits in it.

351
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:28,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, it still doesn't taste any different.

352
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:29,333
Speaker 0: It does.

353
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,886
Speaker 0: cream of wheat is just the player is it you haven't had there?

354
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:32,610
Speaker 0: you gotta eat the free.

355
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,383
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've had all sorts of cream of wheat.

356
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:38,349
Speaker 1: when I was in the Cub Scouts They made us eat it every morning because it was the only thing they had at camp.

357
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:42,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, and no matter who made it or what they made it always tasted like nothing.

358
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:44,799
Speaker 0: I'll make you a cream of wheat that doesn't taste like nothing.

359
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,445
Speaker 1: I don't think you can I can.

360
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:56,421
Speaker 0: the trick is some people They put too much water or they don't get rid of enough water and then it's not thick enough and it's all watery and it Tastes like you want something hot and mushy and sweet on a cold day.

361
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:02,617
Speaker 1: have some chocolate, you know cocoa or something Hot cocoa filled with marshmallows.

362
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:03,639
Speaker 0: It's no good.

363
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,682
Speaker 0: It's all sugar.

364
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:06,165
Speaker 0: It's not a breakfast.

365
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:07,148
Speaker 0: That's freaking dessert.

366
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:08,130
Speaker 1: That's a breakfast.

367
00:23:09,232 --> 00:23:14,310
Speaker 1: You realize in the I usually eat pumpkin pie for breakfast pretty much from it's also dessert.

368
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,924
Speaker 0: But I don't eat pumpkin from September until December not for eating there for decorating.

369
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,350
Speaker 1: All right, so let's get on this one.

370
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:24,630
Speaker 1: Scott doesn't like pumpkin pie, which is probably the best pie ever conceived on to man.

371
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:27,077
Speaker 0: I've cut open pumpkins.

372
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:28,201
Speaker 0: I smelled pumpkins.

373
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,184
Speaker 0: I've eaten pumpkin.

374
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:30,790
Speaker 0: pumpkin does not taste good.

375
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:33,108
Speaker 0: It's only use is as an entertainment.

376
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:35,400
Speaker 1: gourd See one or squat.

377
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,630
Speaker 0: I just a gourd or squash.

378
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,059
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure gourds and squashes are very similar.

379
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,609
Speaker 0: if not, they are similar, but I wonder which one a pumpkin is.

380
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:42,514
Speaker 1: It's a squash.

381
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:43,097
Speaker 1: Okay.

382
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,626
Speaker 1: I just I'm pretty sure.

383
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,008
Speaker 1: I don't know.

384
00:23:45,712 --> 00:23:46,697
Speaker 0: You're just deciding.

385
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:56,647
Speaker 1: but here's the thing one cider one pumpkin bread is awesome to pumpkin seeds when roasted are awesome.

386
00:23:56,687 --> 00:24:00,700
Speaker 1: and three Pumpkin pie especially when it's got a lot of nutmeg in.

387
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,628
Speaker 1: it is the most wonderful dessert pie in the world.

388
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:04,370
Speaker 0: I get it.

389
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,561
Speaker 0: It's all about the nutmeg and the hallucinating.

390
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:10,533
Speaker 0: That's why you like it Alrighty.

391
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,221
Speaker 0: so you don't really like pumpkin pie.

392
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,850
Speaker 0: you like nutmeg pie.

393
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:28,709
Speaker 1: Actually one thing I'll notice that the best pumpkin of I ever had and I'm not kidding here was one that Emily's mom made Over a Thanksgiving because she used a different amount of nutmeg and there were some other spices in it And it was just a really freaking good pumpkin pie.

394
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:34,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not a fan of eating pumpkin, but you won't eat strawberry rhubarb the second greatest pie ever made either.

395
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:36,036
Speaker 0: I'll eat strawberry.

396
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:38,128
Speaker 0: strawberries are awesome and I'm eating rhubarb.

397
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,270
Speaker 1: But you see you can't have a strawberry pie without rhubarb because rhubarb adds the bite.

398
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:44,778
Speaker 0: You can just not eat rhubarb.

399
00:24:44,898 --> 00:24:47,305
Speaker 0: you can have a strawberry apple pie what?

400
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:47,767
Speaker 1: that's not.

401
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:48,890
Speaker 1: that's nothing compared to strawberry.

402
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,078
Speaker 0: We have a strawberry banana pie.

403
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:52,845
Speaker 1: That would be terrible be awesome.

404
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:54,755
Speaker 1: Can't make a banana pie Why not?

405
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:56,289
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen a banana pie?

406
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:58,616
Speaker 0: No, but we should make.

407
00:24:58,736 --> 00:25:01,610
Speaker 1: there's a reason why bananas don't bake.

408
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,386
Speaker 1: Well, I think banana bread banana bread is not banana.

409
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:07,309
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

410
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:07,650
Speaker 0: Of course?

411
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:13,364
Speaker 1: Alright you take a banana and try to bake it and see what happens to it.

412
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,070
Speaker 0: I can freakin bake a banana pie.

413
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:18,398
Speaker 1: I'll take you up on that.

414
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:20,149
Speaker 1: I don't think you could I could do it.

415
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,018
Speaker 0: I'll get a little.

416
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,050
Speaker 0: get a generic pie.

417
00:25:22,211 --> 00:25:26,150
Speaker 1: I think you can make a banana cream pie, but you couldn't just make a banana pie with slices.

418
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,016
Speaker 0: Oh, you know you strawberry cream pie.

419
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:32,010
Speaker 1: Mmm strawberry cream pie is very good, but it's got nothing on strawberry rhubarb.

420
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,275
Speaker 0: Rhubarb is ass.

421
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:34,460
Speaker 0: it is not meant to be eaten.

422
00:25:34,661 --> 00:25:34,841
Speaker 1: Yes.

423
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:35,243
Speaker 1: It is.

424
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:38,215
Speaker 1: What is not just have to cook it properly So it's not poisonous anymore.

425
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:40,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not meant to be eaten.

426
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:41,909
Speaker 0: It doesn't taste good.

427
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:45,718
Speaker 0: It's just like brown hard nastiness.

428
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:46,320
Speaker 1: It's not brown.

429
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,862
Speaker 1: It's red.

430
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:47,825
Speaker 0: Whatever.

431
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:48,848
Speaker 0: It's reddish brown.

432
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:49,450
Speaker 0: It's not good.

433
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:56,889
Speaker 1: See a strawberry pie would be okay, but the rhubarb adds this kick to it that really pushes it beyond the realm of mortal food.

434
00:25:58,044 --> 00:26:03,681
Speaker 0: Um Yeah, because you die when you eat the poison rhubarb, that's why it's not mortal food.

435
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,130
Speaker 1: Okay, except the fact that you don't die.

436
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:10,513
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do Okay.

437
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:11,156
Speaker 0: Anyway, Mr.

438
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:12,081
Speaker 0: Rhubarb is ass.

439
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:12,343
Speaker 1: Mr.

440
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:13,649
Speaker 1: Hotshot bring up a food.

441
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:18,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, freakin what it's the hell with you not drinking milk the most necessary thing to drink.

442
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:23,710
Speaker 1: All right I'm a mammal and once mammals reach the age of majority, they don't need milk anymore.

443
00:26:24,594 --> 00:26:25,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, okay.

444
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:28,659
Speaker 0: But then why don't you stop eating?

445
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,050
Speaker 0: I don't know other things that you only ate when you were a kid.

446
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:34,681
Speaker 1: I stopped eating a lot of the things I ate when I was a kid.

447
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:36,810
Speaker 1: I almost never eat candy anymore.

448
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,678
Speaker 0: Well, I don't eat candy so much either.

449
00:26:38,738 --> 00:26:41,410
Speaker 0: but you know, you look at animals in the wild.

450
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:45,942
Speaker 0: They generally eat the same shit when they're you know throughout all their ages.

451
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:48,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, except change their diets based on age.

452
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do.

453
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:51,209
Speaker 1: They all stop drinking milk.

454
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:55,425
Speaker 1: All mammals stop drinking milk except humans who have cows.

455
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:58,139
Speaker 1: and we drink cows milk Yeah, but they all.

456
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,190
Speaker 0: everything else stays exactly the same.

457
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:02,809
Speaker 0: What does it matter if you stick with milk or not?

458
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,982
Speaker 0: Just because because it does other animals don't have ways of producing other things.

459
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,294
Speaker 1: my body tricks me every now then because sometimes I'll have A whole bunch of candy.

460
00:27:10,314 --> 00:27:13,690
Speaker 0: if you want to make that argument, maybe you should just you know only eat.

461
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,220
Speaker 0: But you know that you would get if you were like a caveman.

462
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:20,390
Speaker 1: see the thing is I'm an omnivore so I could eat anything.

463
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:27,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, well if you're a caveman and oh, you know and you're a natural living in the wild human You would only eat nuts berries and raw meat.

464
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:28,373
Speaker 1: You know what?

465
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,945
Speaker 1: I would really like to eat almost nothing but raw meat fine.

466
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,570
Speaker 0: No more strawberry rhubarb pies.

467
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:38,330
Speaker 1: Just strawberry nuts and Rami Strawberry rhubarb pie out in the wilderness.

468
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:45,615
Speaker 0: No, no, no, not if you're a caveman or a dumb animal who doesn't know how to get milk after you know But their mom is.

469
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:47,040
Speaker 1: I'm not a caveman anymore.

470
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,608
Speaker 0: I'm a human being and that's why you can fucking drink milk.

471
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:51,274
Speaker 1: Well, I could.

472
00:27:51,615 --> 00:27:53,281
Speaker 1: milk tastes like crap.

473
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:54,586
Speaker 0: milk tastes great.

474
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,790
Speaker 1: It's filling and fatty.

475
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:57,964
Speaker 0: That's exactly why it's great.

476
00:27:58,024 --> 00:27:58,690
Speaker 0: fat tastes good.

477
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:01,908
Speaker 1: Milk doesn't taste good though milk tastes great.

478
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:04,436
Speaker 0: Milk is like the most refreshing thing.

479
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:14,112
Speaker 1: I mean you eat like a cake or a chocolate chip cookie or anything I've noticed because every now and then I'll eat a whole bunch of chocolate cake or something I'll be like.

480
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:16,280
Speaker 1: I have a person girl cookies.

481
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:17,305
Speaker 1: cookies are nasty.

482
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:18,590
Speaker 0: Some of them are so all of them.

483
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,159
Speaker 1: I can't stand them anymore.

484
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,285
Speaker 0: No, it's all about the regular.

485
00:28:21,305 --> 00:28:23,382
Speaker 0: the trefoils are good Now when I've been mince are okay.

486
00:28:23,422 --> 00:28:30,878
Speaker 1: when I was a little kid I like Girl Scout cookies, but now I've grown up and I try to eat him and All of them except for the shortbread ones.

487
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,881
Speaker 0: That's the trefoil.

488
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:32,704
Speaker 1: I know tastes like.

489
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,490
Speaker 1: tastes like processed crap.

490
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:36,809
Speaker 1: It's like corn syrup and fat and lard.

491
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:40,330
Speaker 0: Well, the thin mint ones are okay, but the trefoil ones are by far the best.

492
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:46,036
Speaker 1: They're actually pretty crappy compared to real shortbread cookies And whatever you ever had.

493
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:50,490
Speaker 0: real shortbread cookies like fresh ones don't really care a cookie is a cookie.

494
00:28:50,974 --> 00:28:51,418
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

495
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,266
Speaker 1: a cookie is a cookie.

496
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:53,633
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

497
00:28:53,734 --> 00:29:07,769
Speaker 1: So the only way a cookie can get better is by being hotter or squishier Alright, so if a cookie is a cookie then if I go to the store and get myself a cajun cookie It'll be exactly the same as a fresh-baked mama rose cookie.

498
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:09,917
Speaker 0: No, it's not the same.

499
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:12,670
Speaker 1: but you just said it cookies a cookie different kind of cookie.

500
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,421
Speaker 1: No, they're the same cookie a cajun cookie or a mama rose cookie.

501
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:17,986
Speaker 0: Those are two different cookies.

502
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:21,200
Speaker 1: No, they're not a Cajun cookie is just a mama rose cookie.

503
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,386
Speaker 1: That's been left out a while.

504
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:23,009
Speaker 0: Why?

505
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,730
Speaker 0: What is up with you and these weird ass kind of cookie?

00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,003
Speaker 0: It's like you like any food.

507
00:29:29,044 --> 00:29:29,590
Speaker 0: that's weird.

508
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:30,474
Speaker 0: It's not.

509
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:34,209
Speaker 0: if it's a it's a weird food that something out of the norm rims like.

510
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:36,416
Speaker 0: ooh I like weird food just cuz it's weird.

511
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,001
Speaker 1: I don't like cajun cookies.

512
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,727
Speaker 1: cajun cookies the worst thing ever.

513
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:43,542
Speaker 0: I don't care I'm just saying you just like weird things for the sake of the weirdness.

514
00:29:43,602 --> 00:29:44,024
Speaker 0: All right.

515
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:45,530
Speaker 1: All right, I'll bite like what?

516
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,232
Speaker 1: What do I like?

517
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:52,032
Speaker 1: that's weird that I like for the sake of liking it pretty much everything you eat You.

518
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:57,830
Speaker 0: also whenever you cook something you will add like a bajillion spices just for the sake of adding a bajillion spices.

519
00:29:58,499 --> 00:29:59,190
Speaker 1: Alright, like what?

520
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:05,030
Speaker 1: I mean if I make a grilled cheese Nothing makes a grilled cheese better than having some dill sprinkled in with the butter on the outside.

521
00:30:05,632 --> 00:30:07,178
Speaker 0: No, that's generally not a good.

522
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:10,310
Speaker 0: where have you ever seen anyone do that, but you restaurants?

523
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:13,830
Speaker 0: What restaurant puts dill in the butter on a grilled cheese sandwich?

524
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,289
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of donners put dill on the grilled cheese.

525
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:20,530
Speaker 0: I never heard of such a thing and never seen such a thing ever or what else.

526
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,270
Speaker 1: Well, I mean what things do I add spices to that?

527
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,557
Speaker 1: You don't like me adding spices to.

528
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:32,252
Speaker 0: pretty much any time you cook a tomato sauce You take every spice that we have in the cabinet and dump it in there and then the tomato sauce is basically just a spice Mush.

529
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:35,570
Speaker 1: actually, all I put in is paprika usually and I don't even put in that much.

530
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,982
Speaker 0: Well, you're not putting in enough because you do got to put something in there.

531
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:41,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I put paprika in there?

532
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:43,596
Speaker 0: No, it's usually not the net thing.

533
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:45,182
Speaker 0: You need to put in so much of.

534
00:30:45,663 --> 00:30:47,450
Speaker 0: you generally need more garlic powder in there.

535
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:48,373
Speaker 0: That's what you need.

536
00:30:48,895 --> 00:30:51,383
Speaker 1: All right, but I thought I wasn't supposed to put stuff in.

537
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:56,830
Speaker 0: you are but you put way too much stuff You know like throw spices and all kinds of crazy stuff.

538
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:01,110
Speaker 0: I think you might as well just eat the spice because the way you put spice on all the other flavors are destroyed.

539
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:08,560
Speaker 1: I think this argument comes out of the fact that Scott makes effectively McDonald's eggs make McDonald's eggs.

540
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,905
Speaker 1: That's idea of cooking eggs is?

541
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:11,050
Speaker 1: he'll beat him up, right?

542
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,374
Speaker 1: He'll just beat him up straight.

543
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:14,343
Speaker 1: doesn't add milk or water or anything.

544
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:15,649
Speaker 0: I thought you didn't like milk.

545
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:18,840
Speaker 1: I don't like drinking milk, but milk is useful for cooking.

546
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,345
Speaker 0: Well, but you're a mammal.

547
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:21,068
Speaker 0: you you're.

548
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:21,590
Speaker 0: you're done.

549
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:22,788
Speaker 0: You shouldn't ingest milk.

550
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:27,310
Speaker 1: No, that wasn't my argument wasn't that I shouldn't because that my argument was that that is a funny argument.

551
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,410
Speaker 1: The actual argument is that drinking milk is not a fun thing and it doesn't taste good.

552
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:39,670
Speaker 1: It refreshes the palate after a dessert, you know, what refreshes the palate much more after dessert some wine or a cold beer?

553
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:46,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you just you're like those people who like drinking wine because you know, you like being all wine and froofy.

554
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:48,090
Speaker 1: I really like wine.

555
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,357
Speaker 0: You like being all froofy.

556
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:52,202
Speaker 1: I don't think I like being all wine.

557
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:53,747
Speaker 0: It just tastes like bad grape juice.

558
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:57,560
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, you've never actually had good wine though.

559
00:31:57,581 --> 00:32:00,070
Speaker 1: The only wine you've ever had is Meinischewitz and Hobo wine.

560
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:03,525
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I drank some other crazy wine once.

561
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:04,750
Speaker 0: It just tasted worse.

562
00:32:05,011 --> 00:32:07,138
Speaker 1: You drank that mead, but that mead was bad.

563
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,162
Speaker 1: That mead was.

564
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:10,390
Speaker 0: you gave me something once like way back at RIT.

565
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:15,930
Speaker 1: Yeah at RIT I bought this bottle of mead and we all opened it up and we all tried it and it tasted like an open asshole.

566
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,475
Speaker 0: I think there's another time.

567
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,304
Speaker 0: I drank like some white wine and it tasted bad.

568
00:32:20,324 --> 00:32:21,648
Speaker 1: Mead was whitish.

569
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:29,948
Speaker 0: Whatever the point is White wine, especially white wine, but also fancy red wine is bad.

570
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,107
Speaker 0: I mean white grape juice is bad enough and I can read I can eat a green grape.

571
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:38,983
Speaker 0: a green grape is All right, not as good as a red grape, but good enough.

572
00:32:39,506 --> 00:32:41,881
Speaker 0: and a grape juice That's you know, red grape juice.

573
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:46,682
Speaker 0: that tastes good, too But white wine is just bad.

574
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:48,890
Speaker 0: It doesn't taste like grapes.

575
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:51,269
Speaker 0: It tastes just like bad water.

576
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:55,603
Speaker 1: See, I don't know where you're coming from because white wine is fantastic.

577
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:57,910
Speaker 1: I really like a good German ice wine.

578
00:32:58,131 --> 00:32:59,775
Speaker 0: It tastes like bad fruit water.

579
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:00,357
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.

580
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:03,205

00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:42,646
Speaker 1: see.

593
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:49,429
Speaker 1: now the problem here Scott is that that was a straw man and more importantly in terms of straw man He has no brain.

594
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:59,211
Speaker 1: It seems to me that your argument with food with me Oh with everyone cuz you've made the same argument to other people before is that if anyone in the world like something that you don't Like.

595
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:03,967
Speaker 1: then you assume that they like it for some stupid reason that they don't actually know.

596
00:34:04,027 --> 00:34:07,919
Speaker 0: not everything It's only things that are you know weird.

597
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,362
Speaker 1: what wine is not weird?

598
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:14,190
Speaker 1: wine was the staple of drink for thousands of years of human existence.

599
00:34:15,273 --> 00:34:22,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not just not weird It's weird to have all these different strange, you know varieties of water.

600
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:23,150
Speaker 1: not strange.

601
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:28,469
Speaker 1: They only sound strange to you because they're in other languages because they come from those countries.

602
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:31,851
Speaker 1: It's called ice wine because it's German Bet.

603
00:34:31,913 --> 00:34:32,393
Speaker 0: if all those?

604
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:37,710
Speaker 0: if they didn't have if the wines didn't have fancy names if they actually named them like why number one?

605
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:38,638
Speaker 0: Why number two?

606
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,989
Speaker 0: why number three or something?

607
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,274
Speaker 0: You know like that it.

608
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:47,493
Speaker 0: I'm saying the marketing of the wine and the labeling of the wine is a huge effect on you and your Psychology.

609
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:48,536
Speaker 1: no, it doesn't.

610
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:51,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what has a huge effect on me the way a wine tastes?

611
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:55,030
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so because you realize the names of wines.

612
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,690
Speaker 1: It's not like marketers came up with them.

613
00:34:57,211 --> 00:35:03,470
Speaker 1: We're gonna call this wine a Merlot and we're gonna call this wine a Chianti and we're gonna call this wine.

614
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,210
Speaker 1: I want you to call it a Hebrew.

615
00:35:06,643 --> 00:35:14,073
Speaker 0: You know I should do is you take wines and like take them out of the bottles and switch them into different bottles and see if you Can tell.

616
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:15,522
Speaker 0: I don't think you good.

617
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:16,890
Speaker 1: I can tell the difference.

618
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:18,879
Speaker 1: I mean here's the thing I've had.

619
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:27,242
Speaker 0: so like if you went to the store and you bought a Merlot and there was actually Something else in that bottle and it wasn't a Merlot you wouldn't freakin know.

620
00:35:27,262 --> 00:35:29,970
Speaker 0: I just like oh, this is an excellent Merlot.

621
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:35,550
Speaker 1: See actually probably not because my Merlots taste a pretty general way.

622
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:42,939
Speaker 1: And if it didn't taste like that, it probably tastes pretty bad and I'd go Yeah, this isn't good and I just pour the bottle out.

623
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:44,324
Speaker 0: Well, it wouldn't be something bad.

624
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:46,310
Speaker 0: It would be some other wine.

625
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:47,556
Speaker 0: It just that was good.

626
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:50,190
Speaker 0: It just wouldn't be a Merlot would be some other wine.

627
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:53,149
Speaker 0: I can't I don't know any names but you get the point.

628
00:35:53,916 --> 00:36:00,190
Speaker 1: See I can tell the difference between the wines I like like but I can't tell the difference between most wines because I don't know enough about it.

629
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,137
Speaker 1: But like Merlot's I've had a whole bunch.

630
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:03,141
Speaker 1: so I can kind of tell.

631
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:07,198
Speaker 1: and if I drink like Alsatian wines I drink a lot of those because I like them.

632
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,390
Speaker 1: so I could tell if you gave me just some crap.

633
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:21,629
Speaker 1: Oh white wine when I expected another one, but if you gave me Watch your blah blah blah or versus a blah blah blah blah And I don't drink those much if at all then I couldn't tell I probably wouldn't know.

634
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,041
Speaker 0: And it's a whole culture.

635
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:25,189
Speaker 0: wine is no good.

636
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:26,474
Speaker 0: It's all I'm saying.

637
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:29,505
Speaker 1: but you realize the names come from, you know, ancient practice.

638
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:30,870
Speaker 0: It's not about the names.

639
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,294
Speaker 1: So what's it about?

640
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:33,378
Speaker 1: What's wrong with wine?

641
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:34,783
Speaker 0: It's about the fight that you had.

642
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:36,529
Speaker 0: just like it because it's good.

643
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,839
Speaker 1: I like it purely because it tastes good.

644
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:39,803
Speaker 0: It doesn't taste good.

645
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,406
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

646
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:41,270
Speaker 0: It doesn't see that.

647
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:46,870
Speaker 0: I think you I think You know, it starts out where you like it because you want to like it.

648
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:50,144
Speaker 0: So you get into it and then I decide that it tastes good.

649
00:36:50,184 --> 00:36:57,470
Speaker 0: you change your own mind To make you so that you like what you want to like and then you actually like it afterwards.

650
00:36:57,771 --> 00:36:58,394
Speaker 0: You don't like it.

651
00:36:58,414 --> 00:37:02,309
Speaker 1: to begin with you make this argument to almost everyone who likes things that you don't like.

652
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:04,963
Speaker 0: No, it's not just when you like things that I don't like.

653
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:12,116
Speaker 0: there are things you like that I also like or things that I we both don't like And it's the same thing.

654
00:37:12,478 --> 00:37:13,341
Speaker 1: see don't freak.

655
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:19,070
Speaker 1: when I first had communion because I went to a Catholic school They made us do all that stuff and we had to eat the little Jesus cookie.

656
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:26,778
Speaker 1: And then we got to drink some red wine out of this giant gold chalice and everyone drank out of the same chalice Which is kind of horrible now that I'm older.

657
00:37:26,798 --> 00:37:27,782
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is kind of hard.

658
00:37:27,802 --> 00:37:29,730
Speaker 1: I'm glad I didn't get tuberculosis or something.

659
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,589
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

660
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:44,062
Speaker 1: But the thing is it tasted really really good and I got in trouble because whenever communion came I'd tip the thing up in the priest's hand and drink as much as I could and I've always liked wine from the first time I ever had it.

661
00:37:44,082 --> 00:37:45,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, same with soda.

662
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:53,943
Speaker 1: I remember the day my mom gave me a small glass of dr Pepper with ice cubes in it and it was like ambrosia.

663
00:37:54,384 --> 00:37:55,308
Speaker 1: and from that day forth.

664
00:37:55,368 --> 00:37:59,888
Speaker 1: I drank dr Pepper almost every day and in fact in high school, I would drink five or six cans a day.

665
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:05,390
Speaker 0: every day I drank a can of soda when I was a kid and it hurt my mouth and it was poisonous.

666
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:06,995
Speaker 0: It tasted like acid.

667
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:07,918
Speaker 0: that was just all right.

668
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:08,179
Speaker 1: All right.

669
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,045
Speaker 1: So here's something you don't like soda.

670
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:11,510
Speaker 0: So it is poison.

671
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,293
Speaker 0: I don't drink it.

672
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:13,398
Speaker 1: How is it poison?

673
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,322
Speaker 0: Number one?

674
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:15,447
Speaker 0: The carbonation hurts.

675
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:18,323
Speaker 1: number two I gotta back that up here.

676
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:20,735
Speaker 1: the Carbonation hurts.

677
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:22,139
Speaker 0: it does so.

678
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:25,750
Speaker 1: you're saying that carbonated beverages in some way harm you.

679
00:38:26,312 --> 00:38:26,936
Speaker 0: They don't.

680
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:29,190
Speaker 0: they make it my mouth feel pain.

681
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:31,758
Speaker 1: That's not normal.

682
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:33,546
Speaker 0: It's not normal about it.

683
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:40,050
Speaker 1: Um Do you do you think that everyone else feels pain when they drink soda, I think they just I don't know.

684
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,812
Speaker 0: Maybe they like it.

685
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:43,459
Speaker 1: There's no pain when you drink soda.

686
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,522
Speaker 1: It doesn't hurt.

687
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,585
Speaker 0: It stings.

688
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:46,628
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.

689
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:47,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

690
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:48,374
Speaker 1: No, it does.

691
00:38:48,775 --> 00:38:50,422
Speaker 1: I just had some tonic water.

692
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:51,184
Speaker 1: It doesn't sting.

693
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:52,650
Speaker 1: You know, what stings the quinine?

694
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:55,556
Speaker 0: whatever It stings.

695
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:58,628
Speaker 0: never drink carbonated beverage, even a lightly carbonated one.

696
00:38:58,648 --> 00:39:01,236
Speaker 0: it goes And then it goes away.

697
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:03,202
Speaker 1: see to me carbonation is very refreshing.

698
00:39:03,523 --> 00:39:04,466
Speaker 0: no, it's no good.

699
00:39:04,948 --> 00:39:05,770
Speaker 0: All right, it's annoying.

700
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,916
Speaker 0: I want to taste the beverage.

701
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:09,409
Speaker 0: I don't want to have all these poisonous bubbles in my mouth.

702
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:11,049
Speaker 1: So why don't you drink some flat soda?

703
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,459
Speaker 0: Because it tastes like ass.

704
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:15,209
Speaker 1: what kinds of soda have you had flat?

705
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:20,081
Speaker 0: I think I had flat ginger ale and had diarrhea ones.

706
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:21,345
Speaker 1: flat ginger ale is great.

707
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:22,810
Speaker 0: It tasted like bad water.

708
00:39:24,151 --> 00:39:26,420
Speaker 1: Okay, so apparently wine and pop taste the same.

709
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,790
Speaker 1: They taste like bad water to you or bad grape juice?

710
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:38,437
Speaker 0: and Well, it was bad in a different way okay, and the Soda tasted like freakin acid.

711
00:39:38,457 --> 00:39:42,510
Speaker 0: He was uh, I don't know how anyone drinks that shit cuz it tastes great.

712
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:43,696
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

713
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,621
Speaker 0: it tastes bad.

714
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:50,450
Speaker 1: In fact, as soon as we stop recording this I'm gonna go drink some Tom Collins mixer with some ice over it while I do the post-production.

715
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:51,935
Speaker 0: Yeah, drunky.

716
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:54,844
Speaker 1: Uh, there's no alcohol in Tom Collins.

717
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:55,626
Speaker 1: It's just odd.

718
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:56,750
Speaker 1: It tastes kind of like squirt.

719
00:39:57,874 --> 00:39:58,937
Speaker 0: What the hell is squirt?

720
00:39:59,037 --> 00:40:01,325
Speaker 1: squirt is a soda I haven't seen for sale in a long time.

721
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:04,618
Speaker 1: the closest thing I found to it Is Tom Collins, so I drink that instead.

722
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:05,240
Speaker 0: Here's the point.

723
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:06,647
Speaker 0: You're just drinking weird stuff.

724
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:09,353
Speaker 0: because you like drinking I like squirt.

725
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:10,015
Speaker 1: It's a citrus.

726
00:40:10,055 --> 00:40:10,957
Speaker 1: It's just citrus.

727
00:40:11,238 --> 00:40:16,110
Speaker 0: It's a citrus drink, but you're like, oh, I'm drinking a Tom Collins something fancy.

728
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:17,496
Speaker 1: It's not fancy.

729
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,144
Speaker 1: It was 99 cents.

730
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:20,309
Speaker 1: I bought like 10 of them.

731
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:23,541
Speaker 0: The point is it's something out of the ordinary.

732
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:24,164
Speaker 1: It's not.

733
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:25,410
Speaker 1: it's a common drink.

734
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,576
Speaker 1: Squirt was just this brand.

735
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:31,550
Speaker 0: When was the last time you heard anyone say I'm gonna drink me some Tom Collins mixer?

736
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:40,214
Speaker 1: Actually when we were at the concert someone ordered a gin and Tom Collins AKA a gin Collins.

737
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:42,482
Speaker 0: I'd never even heard of Tom Collins before in my life.

738
00:40:42,703 --> 00:40:44,650
Speaker 1: Actually, I looked up on Wikipedia.

739
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:48,974
Speaker 1: That's how I found out what it was and then I bought a bunch Because someone I heard it.

740
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:55,501
Speaker 1: so then you I go and I look at Wikipedia and it's the same as squirt and I really liked Squirt, but I haven't seen it for sale in a long time.

741
00:40:55,742 --> 00:40:57,110
Speaker 1: So I bought it and it tastes like squirt.

742
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:59,469
Speaker 1: So now I got one of my favorite sodas back.

743
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:05,348
Speaker 1: Now if only I could get myself a big pile of some Faygo red pop, I'd be good to go.

744
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:16,049
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, just great all these poisonous as a rocket Didn't you just eat normal food mainstream normal run-of-the-mill food.

745
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:20,403
Speaker 1: Are you saying that soda pop is not mainstream?

746
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:22,330
Speaker 1: I think most Americans drink it.

747
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:27,567
Speaker 0: I'm saying is that why don't you just drink, you know Coke and Pepsi and dr.

748
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:28,610
Speaker 0: Pepper in the normal ones?

749
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,556
Speaker 0: Why do you do a weird soda?

750
00:41:30,837 --> 00:41:31,500
Speaker 1: Um, dr.

751
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:37,260
Speaker 1: My favorite sodas are pretty much any cream soda Any real root beer dr.

752
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:39,370
Speaker 1: Pepper, which is like my favorite soda ever.

753
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,199
Speaker 1: I've drunk it my whole life and I still drink it.

754
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:45,199
Speaker 1: and then like things like squirt I used to like seven up, but I don't anymore.

755
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:47,310
Speaker 0: I drink water juice and milk.

756
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,144
Speaker 1: That's it, but you don't even drink a lot of juices.

757
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:51,370
Speaker 0: I drink a lot of juices.

758
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,079
Speaker 0: I drink more juices than anything else.

759
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:54,869
Speaker 1: You don't seem to want to drink my pomegranate juice.

760
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:59,510
Speaker 0: It's cuz I'm gonna eat a pomegranate and I'm gonna drink pomegranate juice.

761
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,537
Speaker 1: When was the last time you ate a pomegranate?

762
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:02,982
Speaker 0: Six years ago.

763
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:04,186
Speaker 0: It's hard to get a pomegranate.

764
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:05,330
Speaker 0: They sell them in the store.

765
00:42:05,531 --> 00:42:06,958
Speaker 0: They're not good the ones in the store.

766
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:09,070
Speaker 0: Okay, you got to get them right off the frickin tree.

767
00:42:09,971 --> 00:42:11,930
Speaker 1: Alright, so I'll go find a pomegranate tree.

768
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,962
Speaker 1: See you can get the juice and it'll be fresh.

769
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:15,150
Speaker 1: because the juice was science.

770
00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:21,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the juice it doesn't taste the same because eating the pomegranate is all about the brainy bits in the middle of it That are all warbly.

771
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:22,076
Speaker 1: All right.

772
00:42:22,116 --> 00:42:22,798
Speaker 1: So, all right.

773
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:23,340
Speaker 1: Here's the food.

774
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,210
Speaker 1: Scott eats brain and I'm really I don't like it so much.

775
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:27,893
Speaker 0: What am I eating?

776
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:28,455
Speaker 0: the brain?

777
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:31,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just an inside joke from our IT.

778
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is Scott.

779
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:34,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's your brain eating habit?

780
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:36,306
Speaker 1: You gotta stop the monkey brain eater.

781
00:42:36,326 --> 00:42:36,989
Speaker 0: you did it.

782
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,167
Speaker 1: That wasn't funny.

783
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:41,376
Speaker 1: That wasn't funny at all.

784
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:42,521
Speaker 0: You're not funny.

785
00:42:43,224 --> 00:42:48,284
Speaker 1: Your mom's not funny If you can't tell we had nothing for the show today.

786
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,410
Speaker 0: We had nothing at all.

787
00:42:49,612 --> 00:42:51,369
Speaker 0: We decided this is the worst show ever.

788
00:42:51,772 --> 00:43:00,570
Speaker 1: we decided before the show that we were gonna pick a stupid topic and Argue about it as seriously as we could and get as mean as we could but we're tired.

789
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,937
Speaker 1: So we couldn't actually get that mean.

790
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,650
Speaker 0: yet today is just one of those days.

791
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,742
Speaker 0: We're sitting around like what are we gonna do the show on?

792
00:43:06,762 --> 00:43:08,170
Speaker 0: I don't even want to do a show.

793
00:43:08,553 --> 00:43:10,610
Speaker 0: I don't know what the hell we're gonna do a show on at all.

794
00:43:11,072 --> 00:43:11,513
Speaker 0: I don't know.

795
00:43:11,574 --> 00:43:15,168
Speaker 0: Let's just talk about nothing for some time and then give up.

796
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:18,158
Speaker 1: Yep And we're too tired even be funny about it.

797
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,988
Speaker 0: So yeah, I just want to go to bed.

798
00:43:21,008 --> 00:43:27,910
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so the thing is we didn't want to pick a real argument topic because that doesn't work when we're tired.

799
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:33,490
Speaker 1: I mean if we were trying to argue about philosophy or something, it would have just evolved into well the same thing.

800
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,064
Speaker 1: This one devolved into your mom.

801
00:43:36,252 --> 00:43:36,594
Speaker 0: See the thing.

802
00:43:36,654 --> 00:43:40,190
Speaker 0: it'd be so much easier right if we were like Gabe and Tyco.

803
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:43,470
Speaker 0: They just have to make like a three panel comic three times a week.

804
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:50,030
Speaker 0: So they have you know time to like prepare for it and it's there, you know, even when it wasn't their job.

805
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:53,845
Speaker 0: You know, you can edit the comic put it up later in the day.

806
00:43:53,966 --> 00:44:01,097
Speaker 0: earlier in the day We get home from work and we have to eat dinner Do shit around the house

807
00:44:01,157 --> 00:44:03,606
Speaker 1: watch anime play video games play board games

808
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:14,143
Speaker 0: have fun Cook dinner, right and Then we have to sit down for an hour and do the show And then we got to sit down for an hour and put the show

809
00:44:14,244 --> 00:44:15,509
Speaker 1: up which would be fine.

810
00:44:15,932 --> 00:44:23,189
Speaker 1: I said that we both have two hours of commute every day and Every single goddamn weekend we go out of town or something crazy happens.

811
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:25,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we don't have a topic for a show.

812
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,981
Speaker 0: We're gonna lose a lot of time just thinking to the topic.

813
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:32,641
Speaker 0: and if we have to actually prepare for the show Oh forget that we're in trouble.

814
00:44:32,702 --> 00:44:35,876
Speaker 1: instead of preparing for tonight's show Or doing anything constructive.

815
00:44:36,157 --> 00:44:39,310
Speaker 1: We played every single level of outlaw.

816
00:44:40,336 --> 00:44:42,534

Speaker 1: That's invincible.

824
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:55,710
Speaker 1: unlimited ammo cactus is not invincible.
