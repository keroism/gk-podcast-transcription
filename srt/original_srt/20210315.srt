1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,462
Speaker 0: It's Monday March 15th 2021.

2
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:14,929
Speaker 0: I'm rim Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,360
Speaker 0: We are talking about cable management.

4
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:19,798
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:34,273
Speaker 0: so uh today I actually did a a very in your late 30s adult char because I've worked at a lot of places and I've accumulated like I've rolled a lot of them over but not all of them.

6
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,372
Speaker 0: just because I was lazy and it didn't matter that Retirement retirement.

7
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:45,760
Speaker 0: I've accumulated five Separate retirement accounts with five different entities that were at the first had money in them.

8
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:48,429
Speaker 1: The first two jobs I had.

9
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:51,480
Speaker 1: I didn't even realize I had such accounts.

10
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:57,799
Speaker 1: That was what happened with my first real job I when I quit even my cut even my co-op when I was at RIT.

11
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:01,337
Speaker 1: It wasn't a 401k they hit there was like a profit-sharing thing.

12
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:04,169
Speaker 1: I didn't even know It wasn't much money.

13
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,459
Speaker 0: IBM didn't have anything like that.

14
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:11,166
Speaker 0: third They had a little profit-sharing thing, but it was basically like I got 500 bucks when I left You know something along those.

15
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:14,259
Speaker 1: All right, but I never liked these paperwork just kept coming for it.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,406
Speaker 1: I was like what the hell is this?

17
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:16,250
Speaker 1: I finally figured out.

18
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,538
Speaker 1: it was like oh, it's money I have.

19
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:25,262
Speaker 0: Okay So what you know what you want triggered me to do this was I got that paperwork again like for I had a 403.

20
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:27,781
Speaker 1: I don't get any paperwork anymore from anybody I don't.

21
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:28,484
Speaker 0: I don't accept.

22
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:36,095
Speaker 0: I had this 403b from Montefiore Medical Center back when I worked for the hospital and It's like a. it's like a magic 401k for nonprofits.

23
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:36,799
Speaker 0: It was pretty good.

24
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:44,600
Speaker 0: It had like almost no money in it because they didn't pay me shit But it was making its returns.

25
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:49,063
Speaker 0: But I ever like every month they'd send me a paper statement and the system was so out of date I couldn't get a digital.

26
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:49,766
Speaker 0: so I was ignored it.

27
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:52,856
Speaker 0: and then recently it changed.

28
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,431
Speaker 0: like a couple years ago I got paperwork that said oh, it's changing to a different company.

29
00:01:57,812 --> 00:02:00,180
Speaker 0: And then I started getting paperwork from that different company.

30
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:01,787
Speaker 1: Yeah that happens occasionally.

31
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:08,595
Speaker 0: in the last month the Paperwork now said that it was coming changing to a third company and it moved to a third company.

32
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:13,900
Speaker 0: and this third company was finally One that had a website and a portal that worked and was modern.

33
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:17,375
Speaker 0: I logged in and immediately rolled it over into my betterment.

34
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:26,500
Speaker 1: It's just like yeah yeah, I just After it was so with a third job I had that paid real money not counting like, you know high school jobs.

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, right They they had a real 401k that I contributed to and got matched and all the normal stuff.

36
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:40,166
Speaker 1: And then I so when I once I had that I rolled everything over and then every time I changed jobs After 90 days, I would always roll over.

37
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:45,500
Speaker 1: so I have all the money in one Place and when I got this job a few years ago, I rolled it over.

38
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:48,732
Speaker 1: I haven't had to do a big combo.

39
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:53,964
Speaker 1: But the other thing is they've all been 401k rolloverable.

40
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:56,673
Speaker 1: I haven't had other like three B's or IRA.

41
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:58,239
Speaker 0: so I have a bunch of mine.

42
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:09,260
Speaker 0: were That got like turned into IRAs because of nonsense didn't really matter Mmm, but basically I've never had to mix and match right?

43
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,916
Speaker 1: It's always been the same kind directly rolling over at hundred percent of the money from the other.

44
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:16,045
Speaker 0: so I went there.

45
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:23,000
Speaker 0: I basically spent a while like Figuring out the account numbers for all these things and doing all the rollovers and it's at least it's easier now.

46
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,247
Speaker 1: Every time I did it even just a few years ago.

47
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:29,460
Speaker 1: I had to like get the HR person at my company involved.

48
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,062
Speaker 1: I couldn't just

49
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:40,100
Speaker 0: oh, you know hard the reason I didn't roll over that one from a pipeline so long ago because after I quit I thought okay, I'll deal with that like in a few more like after I get situated and then the company went under

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:41,823
Speaker 1: And

51
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:45,676
Speaker 0: It was hard to like contact a person to deal with anything.

52
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:46,520
Speaker 0: and that was back.

53
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:49,538
Speaker 0: All these investment firms had like portals that worked.

54
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:51,265
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

55
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:59,099
Speaker 0: there was a time when like kind of like we did that ecommerce show where a lot of old ecommerce sites would be Like oh now that you've chosen the thing you want to buy here's how to mail us a check.

56
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:06,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing is I you know, the previous one in the current one We're both fidelity which made moving the money easier Whatever.

57
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:11,658
Speaker 1: but you know when I log into fidelity this two accounts listed there and the old one.

58
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,447
Speaker 1: for some reason They didn't take all the money.

59
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:14,131
Speaker 1: It was like some.

60
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:17,610
Speaker 1: it was like 35 cents or something Like they didn't.

61
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,478
Speaker 1: they didn't get a hundred percent of the money out of there.

62
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:25,098
Speaker 1: So we kept reporting on it and I was like eventually I called them and I was like look I got like 35 cents.

63
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:27,879
Speaker 1: Can you just like do something about that?

64
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:30,127
Speaker 0: I got so actually.

65
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,439
Speaker 1: so what they did is they changed it.

66
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:33,931
Speaker 1: So now it's a zero.

67
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:34,557
Speaker 1: it says zero.

68
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:39,956
Speaker 1: now I guess they just took the 35 cents and ran away with it or whatever, but I don't care

69
00:04:40,117 --> 00:04:52,448
Speaker 0: you're when you're like 70 We're gonna be in the retirement home playing Pendragon and you're gonna open The equivalent of how letters get delivered in that distant future and it's gonna be like, yeah Here's the dollar 80 that you

70
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:53,452
Speaker 1: are earned.

71
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,440
Speaker 1: But the point is the 35 cents is gone.

72
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,180
Speaker 1: I don't know where it went But when I log in it still shows both accounts and it's like can you just get get rid of that one?

73
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,693
Speaker 1: It's like it's it's done right?

74
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:08,940
Speaker 0: It's like close it You know, what sucks about working in enterprise software is that I know why a lot of times you just can't get rid of that.

75
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:11,445
Speaker 0: There's the same reason.

76
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,480
Speaker 0: my steam login still includes part of my social security number.

77
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway,

78
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:26,118
Speaker 0: yeah Anyway, but I actually that reminded me of a related thing where I had a bank account That I didn't think had any money in it that I forgot about

79
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:27,903
Speaker 1: Money that I

80
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:33,263
Speaker 0: haven't been to in forever and I eventually got a letter from the government That was one of those.

81
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:40,842
Speaker 0: Hey, the government has determined that you are the custodian of this unclaimed money Mm-hmm.

82
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:41,545
Speaker 0: There was.

83
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:43,491
Speaker 0: there was like 400 bucks in there.

84
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:44,796
Speaker 1: It happens.

85
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:45,980
Speaker 0: Yeah problem is back.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,348
Speaker 0: Well, I remember when I had that there is a in what.

87
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:52,563
Speaker 0: I could really use that money back when I had that account if I It was there.

88
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:57,500
Speaker 1: if you live in the United States, there's usually a website for your state.

89
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,746
Speaker 1: I know New York has one.

90
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:01,520
Speaker 1: I think the comptroller runs the website.

91
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,674
Speaker 1: I'm not sure but basically you type your info into this.

92
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:09,399
Speaker 1: totally legit not You know, make sure you find an actual legit one and not a fake one.

93
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:19,740
Speaker 1: but I know for sure that New York has a website where you type in your info and they find if there is Unclaimed money in New York that actually belongs to you.

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,020
Speaker 1: It's like in this database, but you just you just can't get it unless you look it up.

95
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:23,827
Speaker 1: So it never hurts.

96
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:26,931
Speaker 1: there wasn't any money in there for me But it never hurts to go.

97
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:28,119
Speaker 1: everyone should go and take a look.

98
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:42,555
Speaker 1: You know if such a thing exists where you live and if you are in it Because there might be money that belongs to you that for some reason the government is just holding and waiting for you to come And claim yeah, it takes you what five minutes to check, you know, google it.

99
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,999
Speaker 1: It's not not a joke at all I'm totally serious.

100
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:57,106
Speaker 0: so in some news One thing that has caused problems for technologists and humans for basically all of our adult lives And this has been around for a long time.

101
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:00,337
Speaker 0: Can you experience it this weekend daylight saving time?

102
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,640
Speaker 0: Yep, there's no s on the end because remember I I was for many years a professional time nerd like my job.

103
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,527
Speaker 1: I don't think the s matters that much.

104
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:11,751
Speaker 0: There's no fucking s there.

105
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,948
Speaker 0: Don't say it with an s. It's not daylight savings time It's daylight saving time.

106
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:18,600
Speaker 0: as in we are going to save daylight during this time.

107
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:24,390
Speaker 1: Anyway, daylight savings time mean the same thing It's the time in which there is daylight.

108
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,980
Speaker 0: save the time in which there are daylight savings.

109
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,402
Speaker 1: There will be.

110
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:28,999
Speaker 1: there will be savings of daylight during this time.

111
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:37,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's one not the text of the bill that caused it to come into being nor is it the actual name of the program.

112
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:42,558
Speaker 1: The point is that matters is that this is it sucks ass.

113
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:42,940
Speaker 0: is the point?

114
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:46,520
Speaker 1: This is closer to the correct position, right?

115
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,760
Speaker 1: You know a lot of people are complaining about losing an hour or whatever and some people hate sunlight or complaining about sunlight.

116
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:54,739
Speaker 0: But the point is well the first half of those people the I do.

117
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:56,872
Speaker 0: Time is arbitrary.

118
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:59,605
Speaker 0: for the second job Pound sand.

119
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,169
Speaker 0: we won and we're gonna win right.

120
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:15,920
Speaker 1: the point is you want the clocks to stay Right in a position such that there is more daylight hours When you're not fucking working when the typical typical fucking sleeping is home and awake.

121
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,336
Speaker 0: Exactly maximize the amount of time where the average person in America is home awake.

122
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:23,800
Speaker 1: I don't or anywhere.

123
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:24,906
Speaker 1: Yeah anywhere they live.

124
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:27,420
Speaker 0: Well, cuz most places just don't bother with anything like this at all.

125
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:30,929
Speaker 0: It's very much like an American and European thing.

126
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,378
Speaker 1: The point is you're still choosing the hours, right?

127
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,220
Speaker 1: You know when you know even regardless of where clocks are right?

128
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:41,720
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you could live in like Island X. who knows what time zone it's in right?

129
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,863
Speaker 1: Is your live on Island X?

130
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:43,866
Speaker 1: It's like okay.

131
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:47,839
Speaker 1: when at what time on the clock do people on Island X?

132
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:49,124
Speaker 1: Wake up.

133
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:50,652
Speaker 1: What time do they start working?

134
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:52,200
Speaker 1: What time do they stop working, right?

135
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,780
Speaker 1: It's like it doesn't matter if you shift your clocks around, right?

136
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:10,759
Speaker 1: It's the times, you know that you like you could have a whole country or a whole society where people wake up at Midnight, you know the equivalent of midnight when the earth is on the exact opposite side of the Sun isn't the exact opposite side of the earth, right?

137
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:17,440
Speaker 1: And then you could all just just you could just decide that and that's how people there operate.

138
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,170
Speaker 0: Yeah now daylight saving time.

139
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:33,220
Speaker 0: I think we've talked about this like ignites a lot But basically it exists solely because of the combination of it made sense in an ancient agrarian American time Coupled with the fact that our government can't ever change anything.

140
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,087
Speaker 0: Yep, except the clocks apparently.

141
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:43,638
Speaker 0: but and the thing is most known for for the last 40 years is Fucking up a bunch of IT stuff between two and four times a year.

142
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,779
Speaker 1: Well, not I mean you've got you have your shit together now.

143
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:59,407
Speaker 1: You would think that there are so many outages and weird problems around daylight saving time Around the world four times a year.

144
00:09:59,507 --> 00:09:59,949
Speaker 1: I think it's.

145
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:11,100
Speaker 1: I think it's been you know close to like, you know, maybe 15 years since I've had a database that wasn't full of just everything in UTC and that's it.

146
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:23,166
Speaker 0: So honestly, it's not databases and like data quality issues It's usually like DevOps like real-time systems monitoring type stuff that messes up these days Mmm like that.

147
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:23,829
Speaker 0: That's what I see.

148
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:35,111
Speaker 0: But anyway, there is Possibly literally the only thing that any American Republican in our government has ever supported in.

149
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:37,117
Speaker 0: that is actually a good idea.

150
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:46,694
Speaker 0: There is a bipartisan bill in the Senate Democrats and Republicans Trying to do exactly what Scott and I have always wanted.

151
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:52,552
Speaker 0: now that we've lost The hour in quotes and sprung forward into the correct time the better time.

152
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:56,969
Speaker 0: the bill says let's just fucking stay here Forever and never go back.

153
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,432
Speaker 0: That's right.

154
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:58,639
Speaker 1: That's what we should do.

155
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,071
Speaker 1: But also that bill I think has come up many many times.

156
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:04,440
Speaker 1: so it's not really news that it's up again.

157
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,250
Speaker 0: Well, it's interesting that it's not like you could.

158
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,093
Speaker 1: you could say you could.

159
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,863
Speaker 1: we could have said that same news for I think Probably every year.

160
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:16,920
Speaker 0: Well, what's interesting is it's not clear why this bill never actually passes.

161
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,652
Speaker 0: No one disagrees with this except because it's not.

162
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:30,008
Speaker 1: it's not a high priority and If it actually came close to passing they'd start to report on it and people hate change So they'd get mad and sit goes sign style.

163
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:33,780
Speaker 1: So yeah, if you're a representative, it's like, you know, how hard do you want to?

164
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,997
Speaker 1: Push on this, you know It's like just to start a big bunch of nonsense and it'll be a huge news.

165
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:47,345
Speaker 1: and more, you know When you're dealing with like something is actually important like, you know climate change or people dying Why would you waste your time on this?

166
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:51,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, you just toss the paper out there and then it's like that's it.

167
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:52,322
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is.

168
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:56,859
Speaker 0: there is evidence though that it would actually improve public health for reasons that are probably too much for the show.

169
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:59,147
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things that are improved public health.

170
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:02,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this one costs us nothing and just makes the world a better place.

171
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,513
Speaker 1: Government requires someone to do work to push something through and everyone's working on something more important.

172
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,198
Speaker 1: Yeah or not working at all.

173
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:10,519
Speaker 1: Yeah.

174
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:23,074
Speaker 0: So, uh, we'll see if maybe for once this might be the last time this comes up because there has been increased interest in removing This as best I can tell the people who are most against changing it in America are.

175
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:35,100
Speaker 1: I hate to stereotype as old people But it seems like older voters are against it just because they're against stuff Right, but also I think I see a lot of people who are They want to make the standard time permanent because they hate the Sun.

176
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:40,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, they want it to be dark earlier for like reasons that are in baffling and inscrutable to me.

177
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,287
Speaker 0: Yeah a lot of it's People who get up early.

178
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:48,363
Speaker 1: if you meet anyone who's like let's make standard time permanent get your garlic I so I can.

179
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:55,023
Speaker 0: I do know the per a person who is against doing what we wanted who wanted to just stay in regular time Forever standard time.

180
00:12:55,846 --> 00:13:00,160
Speaker 0: their argument was that they get up early and punish all the people who don't also get up early.

181
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,030
Speaker 0: Force people to get up earlier.

182
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:10,194
Speaker 1: I Mean if I had the extent of the art if I was the boss of a company, you know And I didn't have to interact with other companies too much.

183
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:11,783
Speaker 1: I would just be like, yeah We're gonna set our.

184
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,369
Speaker 1: we don't care what the fucking clock say.

185
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:21,520
Speaker 1: we we can start our work at any time We want right, you know and avoid commuting traffic, you know make everyone's life better.

186
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:24,549
Speaker 1: You could make dentist appointments without having to take off work.

187
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,773
Speaker 1: Yeah kinds of good stuff.

188
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:30,880
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in some other news Twitter at a weird outage recently.

189
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,940
Speaker 0: They had one outage only in Russia because the Russian government messed something up when they're trying to censor stuff.

190
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:38,151
Speaker 0: But they had an outage like yesterday.

191
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:45,900
Speaker 0: I think it happened on Sunday and like a little bit over the weekend Twitter accidentally started temporarily banning anyone who tweeted the word Memphis.

192
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:47,563
Speaker 1: It's true.

193
00:13:47,804 --> 00:14:03,520
Speaker 1: They fixed it pretty quickly, but I assume this is some sort of you know Mistake some human error or some AI kind of error that must have detected some yeah You know pattern of bad tweets that had that word and then you know honed in on that word and started.

194
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,347
Speaker 1: Maybe some bots were using that word a lot.

195
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:05,748
Speaker 1: Who knows?

196
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:06,110
Speaker 0: Yeah.

197
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,880
Speaker 0: Well, it looks it's interesting because smile mildly interesting.

198
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:10,412
Speaker 0: it seems like what's been happening.

199
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:23,880
Speaker 0: because if you notice the Twitter lately has been grappling with the fact that people can pretty easily manipulate where specific words into appearing in the trending tweets and A lot of people have been manipulating that lately.

200
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,920
Speaker 0: So I'm pretty sure Twitter tried to put in place some sort of anti gaming system on that but they made it generic.

201
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:33,189
Speaker 0: So it caught pretty much any.

202
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,759
Speaker 0: there's you know, the thing we always talk about there's literally.

203
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:36,887
Speaker 1: no There's not gonna.

204
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:38,479
Speaker 1: Twitter's not gonna explain it to us.

205
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:44,480
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, but there's literally no difference between a lot of people being interested something in something and a DOS.

206
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:45,871
Speaker 0: They're the same thing.

207
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:46,979
Speaker 1: Of course.

208
00:14:47,686 --> 00:15:04,339
Speaker 0: so I Feel like the real story here is that Twitter keeps trying to do these kinds of changes to clamp down on behavior that Embarrasses them or goes against their monetization instead of applying it toward the thing They should apply it toward which is harassment racism, etc.

209
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course What else is new?

210
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:08,308
Speaker 0: Yep.

211
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:10,039
Speaker 0: So you got any other tech news?

212
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,839
Speaker 1: Yes, here's the news.

213
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,279
Speaker 1: This is a little bit old like last month or so.

214
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:15,343
Speaker 1: It's.

215
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:19,176
Speaker 1: it's not really about this particular incident because who gives a crap about that?

216
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:21,844
Speaker 1: it's about the broader Concept right?

217
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:27,700
Speaker 1: is that somebody made a browser extension an add-on right for Chrome Firefox, whatever.

218
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:39,427
Speaker 1: And when you have a browser add-on And Firefox at least usually these things nowadays are used to be that they would just have you know Full control of your browser basically.

219
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:41,133
Speaker 1: Yeah nowadays they'll at.

220
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:46,680
Speaker 1: you'll have to grant the the Permission to your add-ons to do specific things, right?

221
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,680
Speaker 1: But if you want to like your ad blocker you have to give it a shit ton of permissions to actually block ads.

222
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,067
Speaker 1: You don't really have a choice there.

223
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:53,388
Speaker 0: Yep.

224
00:15:53,448 --> 00:16:00,389
Speaker 0: It's got to be able to see the contents of the page exactly, so when you Like live your whole life in this browser.

225
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:11,738
Speaker 1: if you know the add-ons that you choose to you know The browser software itself you have to trust But you have to trust the add-ons you add to the browser written by some who knows who on.

226
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,063
Speaker 1: you know Whatever.

227
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,170
Speaker 1: you just take some code put it in your browser.

228
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, if that code is anything untrustworthy in it Like it could just ruin you.

229
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:22,905
Speaker 1: You know, it's.

230
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:28,600
Speaker 1: there's only so many protections that the browser has to limit the power of like any add-ons whatsoever.

231
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,640
Speaker 1: You can like look at the web pages your you know.

232
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,780
Speaker 1: You go to bank calm and it can just look and see how much your money.

233
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:45,213
Speaker 0: Also web browsers are a high-value target for all the reasons Scott just described like if you cover If you can control someone's web browser you can have it do things.

234
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:48,062
Speaker 1: you can have it make web requests and do all kinds of Net stuff.

235
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:51,176
Speaker 1: and you know, you're just like running JavaScript on someone's computer.

236
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:54,951
Speaker 1: It's like thanks Use your computer to run JavaScript.

237
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:57,079
Speaker 1: mine coins do whatever bullshit, right?

238
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:05,232
Speaker 1: So what happened was is there was an extension that was popular And it was perfectly good.

239
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,157
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with it.

240
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:12,056
Speaker 1: But then the person who made that extension just like sold it to someone else.

241
00:17:12,337 --> 00:17:20,280
Speaker 0: that's happened and Multiple times like you might block you block got to change hands at right and that's why we use you block origin now.

242
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,960
Speaker 1: Don't use regular you block anyway.

243
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:26,960
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's they sold it to someone else and the someone else just put in some malware's.

244
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,466
Speaker 1: And that's that it's like.

245
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:34,799
Speaker 1: and it's like a lot of times people trust something just cuz it's on like github.

246
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,111
Speaker 1: It's like ah, it's open source on github.

247
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:37,493
Speaker 1: Therefore.

248
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:38,779
Speaker 1: Someone must have looked at ya.

249
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,816
Speaker 0: I remember the old days people would be like, oh go to SourceForge and get the thing.

250
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,327
Speaker 0: It's like, okay This is something dot exe.

251
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,540
Speaker 0: just because it happens to be on SourceForge does not mean it.

252
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:52,392
Speaker 1: Mozilla and I think Chrome in their add-on stores.

253
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:58,364
Speaker 1: They do have programs where some of the add-ons are Validated like they like.

254
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:07,200
Speaker 1: they went and they checked and they said like Firefox will go Mozilla will go and say yeah We looked at this add-on and it's legit we you can trust it.

255
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:15,495
Speaker 1: At least if you trust Mozilla then you can trust this add-on and other ones are labeled as like someone uploaded this And we didn't look at it.

256
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:17,851
Speaker 1: We're just Redistributing it on the add-on store.

257
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:20,866
Speaker 1: because that's you know, whatever I think a lot of if it's.

258
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:24,720
Speaker 1: if it's a shady add-on, please click this report button so we can block it.

259
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:37,348
Speaker 0: Right, but in the meantime You know Well two things all your own risk most Malware will not let on that you're infected with malware so you won't know to report anything.

260
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:45,271
Speaker 0: and To a lot of people seem to think that oh, it's open source Like it's on some sort of repo and it's open source.

261
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,580
Speaker 0: Someone would have noticed if it was malware.

262
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:48,564
Speaker 0: Guess what?

263
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:57,075
Speaker 0: Not many people spend their time going through like chrome tab Suspender extensions to look at the source code and see if anything he's going.

264
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:58,500
Speaker 1: you go to install an extension.

265
00:18:58,622 --> 00:18:59,700
Speaker 1: You see it's open source.

266
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:00,424
Speaker 1: It's like.

267
00:19:00,524 --> 00:19:03,560
Speaker 1: are you gonna put through the effort or do you have the ability to look at it?

268
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,274
Speaker 1: Investigate it and determine whether it's malware or not.

269
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can read code.

270
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,532
Speaker 1: Why do you assume that anyone has done that even one time?

271
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:14,620
Speaker 1: if you're not willing to do it that one time yeah.

272
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,499
Speaker 0: So I trust this extension because a bunch of my friends use it.

273
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,390
Speaker 0: They must be smart and they all trust it cuz they know people.

274
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:28,568
Speaker 0: but at no point did anyone actually look and see that it's Forwarding all your traffic to some dodgy IP address in Russia.

275
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:28,969
Speaker 1: Yep.

276
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,579
Speaker 1: If anyone wants to do a good deed pick one of your extensions That's a less popular one, right?

277
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,806
Speaker 1: you know something like you block origin.

278
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:47,238
Speaker 1: you probably don't have to do this right, but find another one that you use and maybe Read the code of it and make sure it's legit and then let everyone know if it's trustworthy or report it if it's not.

279
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:52,600
Speaker 1: and but Yeah, just be aware of Which add-ons you have in your browsers?

280
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,945
Speaker 1: That's the news there.

281
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:57,340
Speaker 1: Okay other news tiny news, right?

282
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,960
Speaker 1: We all know that companies all have these little home pod things.

283
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,268
Speaker 1: I guess Apple is the only one that's actually called a home pod.

284
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:06,938
Speaker 1: the Amazon ones like Alexa and the.

285
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:12,500
Speaker 0: I don't know What's up with the Google cuz Google changed its branding around this stuff a bunch of times and I don't know anymore.

286
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:14,551
Speaker 1: The Amazon one seems to be the winning one.

287
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:18,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean not that I would get one But I'm just saying like it's it's.

288
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:24,720
Speaker 0: I have an old drop cam and I think that like moved into the Google ecosystem But it just won't work anymore and I didn't bother to try to figure it out.

289
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,044
Speaker 1: Point is these things?

290
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:27,666
Speaker 1: I'm not.

291
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:44,839
Speaker 1: I was really surprised that they became popular because I feel like if you've got a big house in the suburbs One little speaker right is like, okay Maybe you put it in the living room or the kitchen like this main area of the house But it's like don't you kind of want to cover the whole house with it?

292
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,667
Speaker 1: It's like you have to get more of them.

293
00:20:47,189 --> 00:20:49,660
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem too useful if it's not everywhere, right?

294
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:54,740
Speaker 1: And also if you've got that much room, you've got room for like an actual sound system.

295
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,518
Speaker 1: Why do you want to have sound coming in this one little guy, even though there are pretty impressive for being one little guy I mean that little.

296
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:01,379
Speaker 0: Good.

297
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:03,664
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, they're not.

298
00:21:03,684 --> 00:21:06,235
Speaker 1: they're pretty impressive for being one little guy, but it's still.

299
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,380
Speaker 1: it's like even in my house.

300
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:11,107
Speaker 1: I have two Like sound systems with speakers in this little.

301
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:19,880
Speaker 0: so my grandparents they had a pretty like swinger house that they built themselves And the house was wired with a really fancy intercom system.

302
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:32,075
Speaker 0: so basically every room had stereo speakers in it and you could use the intercoms like ping other rooms and talk to people and there was a central system that Could connect the whole thing up to the radio the hi-fi system or the CB radio.

303
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:33,299
Speaker 0: that was integrated into the house.

304
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,297
Speaker 1: Yep I've seen those.

305
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:40,179
Speaker 1: But anyway, the point is that Apple they came out with their home pod mini like their last.

306
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:43,239
Speaker 1: Was it one or two keynotes ago late last year?

307
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:51,480
Speaker 1: They're basically just like the home pod mini was interesting because usually you have like iPod iPod nano Right and the smaller one is better in a lot of ways.

308
00:21:51,982 --> 00:21:53,467
Speaker 1: But it's also worse in some ways.

309
00:21:53,507 --> 00:21:57,160
Speaker 1: right the iPod nano did not have the storage or the battery life of the big iPod.

310
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,945
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

311
00:21:57,965 --> 00:21:59,899
Speaker 1: it was lesser in some ways.

312
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:04,679
Speaker 1: The home pod mini definitely seemed to me when they announced it.

313
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:07,394
Speaker 1: Like isn't it just better than the home pod in every way?

314
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:08,379
Speaker 1: like in what way?

315
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:10,711
Speaker 0: So reading is a regular home.

316
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:16,556
Speaker 0: the home pod mini cost $99 a third the price of the home pod and offers notably lower sound quality.

317
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:21,114
Speaker 0: Oh Okay speakers physically smaller speakers are just worse.

318
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:21,375
Speaker 0: It's true.

319
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:22,420
Speaker 0: We'll stop that's true.

320
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:27,989
Speaker 1: But in terms of any other kind of features besides the sound quality, I guess It was just worse.

321
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:28,978
Speaker 1: I mean just better.

322
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:34,680
Speaker 1: So they've just canceled the regular home pod and it's like yeah, no one bought those things to begin with.

323
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,459
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone bought the mini one either.

324
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:44,110
Speaker 1: I guess maybe a rich person would put these in like Sense, I feel like someone who's rich enough.

325
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:47,380
Speaker 0: They're getting a bespoke system like integrated into the house.

326
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:49,387
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I really like.

327
00:22:49,608 --> 00:22:50,471
Speaker 1: these are popular.

328
00:22:50,512 --> 00:23:01,458
Speaker 1: people have them but it's like like yeah if I was you maybe if you're a person with a one-room or two-room apartment and you don't care about sound quality and you're You're not really.

329
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:13,240
Speaker 1: You know I wanted to just works Listening person and you actually talk to Siri or Alexa or whoever out loud Yeah for doing whatever it is that you do with that then maybe that's for you.

330
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:28,560
Speaker 1: But like I never understood who the hell these are for who wants these it seemed like it's something companies wanted to sell right and in the same way that You know SUVs or something car companies wanted to sell and they made people want them, right?

331
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:34,440
Speaker 1: So the companies I think have done and you know, they've done a clearly an amazing job of making people want SUVs.

332
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:41,542
Speaker 1: I think they've done an okay job of making people want these But there's only so much you can do Right in.

333
00:23:41,582 --> 00:23:45,816
Speaker 0: that's a fascinating because my whole career because I'm a product manager like that kind of decision.

334
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:54,285
Speaker 0: I Have always focused on what is a problem that I can solve for people out there where they would be willing to pay me for That solution.

335
00:23:54,305 --> 00:24:00,270
Speaker 0: I have never in my life Actually tried to say I have a thing that's easy to make.

336
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:03,300
Speaker 0: I want to get people to buy this thing like that.

337
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:04,649
Speaker 0: I've never tried that.

338
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,006
Speaker 0: I've never even like gone down that path Mm-hmm.

339
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:11,692
Speaker 1: But yeah, the point is I don't know who these are for.

340
00:24:11,772 --> 00:24:13,037
Speaker 1: It's not unsurprising to me.

341
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:19,220
Speaker 0: Yeah I was really rich like stupid rich and I wanted like a sound system in my giant sprawling house.

342
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:28,339
Speaker 0: I would have fancy speakers mounted into like the ceilings of every room Wired to a central system that is generic and can take literally any input in.

343
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:34,040
Speaker 1: Right, but like I just don't know who you know, you're we're only thinking you're only thing about like the stereo feature, right?

344
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,077
Speaker 1: He's have the that you talk to it, right?

345
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,479
Speaker 0: Well the all the other aspects of it.

346
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:50,399
Speaker 0: I see the place people seem to put these the most in my Experiences like pre kovid when I'd like be in someone's apartment or house is they always put them in the kitchen And they use them while they're like hooking and doing kitchen these stuff.

347
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,272
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can use it for a timer but you can just.

348
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:55,240
Speaker 1: I see a lot of people use Siri for a timer.

349
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:56,997
Speaker 1: They just use their phone or their watch.

350
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,959
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, if you have a home pod you have an iPhone I watch.

351
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:02,183
Speaker 1: Maybe right.

352
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:03,186
Speaker 1: I'll definitely have an iPhone.

353
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:05,272
Speaker 0: No question if they were smart enough to.

354
00:25:05,593 --> 00:25:07,920
Speaker 0: so why do you need real-time respond to me?

355
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,472
Speaker 0: With more advanced queries like Siri, how how long should I cook?

356
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:15,706
Speaker 1: but that the same Siri that's on the home Pod is in the iPad and the iPhone.

357
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:16,629
Speaker 1: It's the same Siri.

358
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,974
Speaker 1: Why wait from camera.

359
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:19,640
Speaker 1: It's like what's the home pod for?

360
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:22,758
Speaker 0: Well, cuz my phone won't listen to me unless I touch it and turn it on.

361
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:25,187
Speaker 0: I Have to keep turning it.

362
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:26,355
Speaker 1: You can make it not do that.

363
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:26,737
Speaker 1: You can.

364
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:27,160
Speaker 1: I don't want it.

365
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,980
Speaker 1: I don't want it to listen when I'm walking this thing.

366
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:35,767
Speaker 0: That's what this thing does and it can't play loud music by itself while I'm cooking and there's a bunch of banging going on in the kitchen.

367
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,834
Speaker 1: That's because you've never had an Apple phone or Apple iPad even even then.

368
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,180
Speaker 0: and I find surprising.

369
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:44,813
Speaker 0: Audio, well that event fan is going.

370
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:45,720
Speaker 0: compared to one of these things.

371
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:47,446
Speaker 0: There's no subwoofer in your eyes.

372
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:54,539
Speaker 1: if the vent fan is going even my real stereo with with 5.1 sound it needs to be cranked to a dangerous level.

373
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:58,339
Speaker 1: So I don't I just turn off audio when the fan is on.

374
00:25:59,283 --> 00:26:04,544
Speaker 0: So in some other news, this is a tariff like this article.

375
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:13,559
Speaker 0: the thing that happened is terrifying to me and It honestly like I already like LG has not really been on my doesn't doesn't terrify me.

376
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,034
Speaker 0: It doesn't terrify me in the sense that I'm not vulnerable to this.

377
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:18,079
Speaker 0: I would never buy an LG TV.

378
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:23,354
Speaker 1: Of course not or an LG monitor or an LG anything, but I got an LG monitor.

379
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:23,816
Speaker 1: It's fine.

380
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:24,819
Speaker 1: It doesn't have ads on it.

381
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:29,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Think it's gonna be fine one day one day.

382
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:31,638
Speaker 1: I think it's not connected to the internet.

383
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:31,980
Speaker 1: It's good.

384
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,974
Speaker 0: Well, this one wasn't connected to the internet either.

385
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:34,720
Speaker 0: That's the problem.

386
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:36,878
Speaker 1: Well, yes and no.

387
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

388
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,186
Speaker 0: so basically the the.

389
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:47,620
Speaker 0: you can read the article to see the details because this kind of thing is Happening in the low end of the TV market and has for some time.

390
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,407
Speaker 0: This is a trend in all industries.

391
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:52,379
Speaker 0: same thing happened with like I don't know e-readers.

392
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:56,515
Speaker 0: cheap e-readers would like show ads on their home screen that you couldn't turn off like.

393
00:26:56,535 --> 00:26:57,178
Speaker 0: that was the thing.

394
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:57,419
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

395
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:05,039
Speaker 0: But the margins on TVs are pretty low and it turns out most consumers unless you're rich and buying like an upper high-end thing.

396
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:07,829
Speaker 1: Price only rich P only rich people.

397
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,980
Speaker 1: and you know tech people who know about tech and snobs Actually care about things like contrast ratio, right?

398
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:20,920
Speaker 1: most people just say I Want to I got a flat TV and I get the biggest one I can afford or the fits on my wall or whatever.

399
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,184
Speaker 0: And how big is it?

400
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:23,830
Speaker 0: How many dollars is it?

401
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:24,312
Speaker 0: That's it.

402
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:26,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, then they don't give a shit about anything else.

403
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,220
Speaker 1: It's only you know people who care of like oh, how's the color reproduction?

404
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,055
Speaker 1: Those the only people care about what anything else.

405
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:38,134
Speaker 1: so I know it's funny Best buy and buying a TV off the rack.

406
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:39,060
Speaker 0: I got some training.

407
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:50,010
Speaker 0: I'm like setting price points and like market research on prices like pricing as a topic and It basically the the thing that came up.

408
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,532
Speaker 0: in the training.

409
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:53,120
Speaker 0: we were talking about how people actually make decisions based on data.

410
00:27:53,782 --> 00:28:04,708
Speaker 0: The fascinating part was people like you and me who actually care at all about the specifications of any ultra rare Significant insignificant you might even pay attention to.

411
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:08,760
Speaker 0: the advice is just pretend those people don't exist or cater exclusively to them.

412
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:10,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

413
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:10,888
Speaker 1: Yep.

414
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:13,160
Speaker 0: We don't exist in the market.

415
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:15,847
Speaker 0: Same reason why I like shitty.

416
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:25,345
Speaker 0: airlines are all shitty in the same ways because the only decision that matters is the number of dollars for the ticket at the time you buy the ticket, so The problem is

417
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:27,131
Speaker 1: because of

418
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:36,740
Speaker 0: that and because of market pressures and margins and everything This kind of thing is now rising higher and higher into the stack into like the middle of the road options.

419
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:46,141
Speaker 0: Basically Fancy o LED TVs not just the bottom of the barrel ones, but like an actual LED TV from LG Has.

420
00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:52,119
Speaker 0: they have embedded ads that will play in the menus built into the TV?

421
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:53,702
Speaker 1: Right.

422
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:55,852
Speaker 1: Well, it's in the smart TV portion, right?

423
00:28:55,892 --> 00:29:00,458
Speaker 1: So if you're not using the smart It's not like it's gonna go on top of like a movie or watch.

424
00:29:00,478 --> 00:29:08,181
Speaker 1: Yeah But when you open up the menus to do smart TV shut shit like use the Netflix app built into the TV Right.

425
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:09,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, press the menu button.

426
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,839
Speaker 1: this menu comes up and it shows you all these apps built into the TV.

427
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:18,980
Speaker 1: You know Netflix Apple TV plus HBO max or whatever and you're going to choose one.

428
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:22,331
Speaker 1: Well, there's a whole area on the screen for them to show ads.

429
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:23,154
Speaker 1: the L because it's the.

430
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:24,619
Speaker 1: you're in the LG OS.

431
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:30,072
Speaker 1: to some It's usually Android powered most of the time Although I've heard that at least one of them is like still web OS.

432
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,822
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter what OS they're using Right is this?

433
00:29:33,263 --> 00:29:43,709
Speaker 1: there's a little computer about as powerful as a phone a shitty phone built into the TV that's doing this stuff and This is why I never get a smart TV, right?

434
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, TV should be a monitor only it should do nothing.

435
00:29:47,301 --> 00:29:47,907
Speaker 0: It's all it is.

436
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:51,285
Speaker 1: That really does a Video signal I send into it does.

437
00:29:51,306 --> 00:30:01,115
Speaker 1: there are still companies making monitors and there actually is a trend lately of monitor companies Making very large monitors.

438
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:06,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, right They're selling them as monitors like by this 55 inch gaming monitor.

439
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:08,140
Speaker 1: and it's like that's a television.

440
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:09,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, but look at it like that.

441
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,020
Speaker 0: But it is called going after the rim and Scott and for other people demographic right there.

442
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,540
Speaker 1: But it's like Alienware has like a 55 inch or I think or something like that.

443
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,100
Speaker 1: But the point is it doesn't have smart TV bullshit in it as a monitor.

444
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:27,777
Speaker 0: So where this ad cropped up was when this person went into the TV to update some stuff.

445
00:30:27,837 --> 00:30:28,840
Speaker 0: the ad just played.

446
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:30,151
Speaker 0: There's no way to turn it off.

447
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,241
Speaker 0: And this is a $1,400 TV.

448
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:42,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean don't use I. this is the advice We've always said and will continue to say do not buy a smart TV if you have no choice.

449
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:43,616
Speaker 1: But to buy a smart TV.

450
00:30:44,562 --> 00:30:47,272
Speaker 1: Do not use any of the smart things in the TV.

451
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:48,778
Speaker 0: never let it connect to the internet.

452
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:51,630
Speaker 1: even never Connect the TV directly to the internet.

453
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,439
Speaker 1: disable the Wi-Fi in the TV.

454
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,969
Speaker 1: Do not let it connect to your Wi-Fi.

455
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:58,720
Speaker 1: do not put an ethernet cable into the TV, right?

456
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,119
Speaker 1: Do not let it touch your home network in any way shape or form.

457
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:16,458
Speaker 1: only use the TV for it's you know, not smart functionality of other devices sending video signals to it probably with HDMI because it's 2021 and you know plug your switch into it.

458
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:23,640
Speaker 1: plug your HTPC into it and if you really aren't gonna have an HTPC and you got a Roku or an Apple TV or something use those.

459
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:27,279
Speaker 1: Those are more trustworthy than the shit that's in the TV.

460
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:27,621
Speaker 1: Right?

461
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:31,219
Speaker 1: an Apple TV is 10,000 times better as much as it's not good.

462
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:38,283
Speaker 1: Yeah, then whatever is in any TV, even the best TV in the world use that instead And that's it.

463
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:39,847
Speaker 0: Yep, and just we need to agree.

464
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:48,960
Speaker 0: like this kind of like a non-consensual Advertising creeping a higher and higher higher into the stack needs to be nipped in the bud because this is all they're gonna.

465
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,074
Speaker 1: It's not just it's not even just advertising right?

466
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:59,238
Speaker 1: It's it's you know, all the other The Internet of shit coupled with the non.

467
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:14,058
Speaker 0: HTPCs tend to not have the full functionality of a web browser going to the site where the content is and Have their own ulterior motives for monetization and often their own algorithms to drive What kind of content get gets pushed at you?

468
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,321
Speaker 1: That's.

469
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,571
Speaker 1: the other thing is that you know, you'd be just.

470
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:20,485
Speaker 1: it's just tons and tons of reasons We've talked about in the past.

471
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:26,270
Speaker 1: but do not if you can at all, right which you probably can Do not you get smart TV?

472
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:29,363
Speaker 1: And if you have a smart TV don't use the smart parts Yep at all.

473
00:32:29,543 --> 00:32:39,639
Speaker 0: ever under any circumstance and since LG is breaking ground in putting these ads How pretty high up in the stack my advice is never buy an LG device again, at least not a TV.

474
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:47,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would not buy, you know, if a company has a TV that has ads in it I'm not going to buy a TV for that company.

475
00:32:47,640 --> 00:33:04,271
Speaker 0: Yeah I would like really I would like to see legislation to make it difficult or impossible to embed ads in devices directly like this like there should be some sort of regulation around this because really What this is gonna turn into have a really good regulation.

476
00:33:04,312 --> 00:33:09,180
Speaker 0: people and very technologically savvy People can avoid this shit and everyone else is stuck with it.

477
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,690
Speaker 1: I have a really easy regulation, you know, because it's already been.

478
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:23,777
Speaker 1: you know, I'm not a lawyer or a constitutional scholar or anything But I am aware Correct me if I'm wrong the while speech is very strongly protected.

479
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,768
Speaker 1: United States Commercial speech is not.

480
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:27,780
Speaker 1: it is illegal to have cigarette ads on TV.

481
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, it used to be illegal to not have prescription drug ads on TV.

482
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:36,700
Speaker 1: You know, you can't even have cigarette ad billboards or magazines anymore, right?

483
00:33:37,822 --> 00:33:39,833
Speaker 0: They're like banned like Congress.

484
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:40,496
Speaker 0: kind of ad.

485
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:41,180
Speaker 0: full stop.

486
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:46,452
Speaker 1: Congress has the power to write regulate commercial speech.

487
00:33:46,753 --> 00:33:48,237
Speaker 1: full stop you could.

488
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:51,304
Speaker 1: they could write a law that says Advertising is illegal.

489
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:55,480
Speaker 1: any company that advertises the CEO goes to prison for their life.

490
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:56,525
Speaker 1: That's the whole law.

491
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:57,792
Speaker 1: the end vote.

492
00:33:58,033 --> 00:33:58,858
Speaker 1: vote on that law.

493
00:33:59,159 --> 00:33:59,320
Speaker 1: vote.

494
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,468
Speaker 1: Yes, there are no more ads anywhere ever.

495
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,115
Speaker 1: or the CEOs in prison.

496
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,991
Speaker 1: Either one of those is fantastic I'm not even joking.

497
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:07,019
Speaker 1: Just do that.

498
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,924
Speaker 0: but anyway things Of the day.

499
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:14,273
Speaker 0: so check this out.

500
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:16,260
Speaker 0: This is actually a really simple video.

501
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:21,400
Speaker 0: It's smarter every day, but I don't think I've ever actually linked to them or if I ever was a long long time ago.

502
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:31,580
Speaker 0: But they did a really really simple video and I want this is my thing of the day to prove a point This is just a video on how to use the snatch block and like how a block and tackle works.

503
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,463
Speaker 0: But it's not like.

504
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:36,520
Speaker 0: the high school physics demonstration of this is why pulleys are magic.

505
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:42,000
Speaker 0: It's actually much more focused on the practical aspects of pulleys.

506
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,690
Speaker 1: Because okay a lot like we've done a pulley thing of the day in the past.

507
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,879
Speaker 0: Uh, not definitely not done this.

508
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:56,288
Speaker 1: I've definitely watched a whole bunch of videos in my life where it's like someone lifts a real heavy thing with a rope because they Got like seven pulleys in line.

509
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:57,374
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is not that though.

510
00:34:57,415 --> 00:35:03,840
Speaker 0: This is more like Practically like how do you how do you as a person in your day-to-day life?

511
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,579
Speaker 0: Quickly and effectively deploy pulleys to solve real problems?

512
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:09,854
Speaker 1: I'm a bicycle effectively kinda.

513
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:19,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I you know as much as I'm very like a lot of us especially like they kind of nerd to listen to a podcast and cares About embedded ads in their smart TV garage your garage door.

514
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:20,942
Speaker 0: Yep They're.

515
00:35:20,962 --> 00:35:29,373
Speaker 0: uh, this is more like if you have to make a pulley or like deal with a pulley quickly or solve a problem Like I don't know you ran your car into a ditch.

516
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,440
Speaker 0: How do you get the car out of a ditch?

517
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:48,996
Speaker 0: there's a difference between you call for having this abstract knowledge of how technology works like how to use a winch and having an intuitive and internalized understanding of how to apply Very simple and effective technology to quickly solve problems people are able to do.

518
00:35:49,036 --> 00:35:54,753
Speaker 0: the latter tend to Survive things better and be more effective in their day-to-day lives.

519
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:56,280
Speaker 0: That's an observation I've had.

520
00:35:56,824 --> 00:36:03,719
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to focus use a pulley Directly think about it.

521
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:08,731
Speaker 0: I had to use a pulley Was actually in like a for real right like solving a realm with the pulley.

522
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:11,060
Speaker 0: was we got a Jeep stuck in a ditch?

523
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,066
Speaker 0: But Basically, all right.

524
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:15,548
Speaker 0: All right, Scott.

525
00:36:15,568 --> 00:36:16,071
Speaker 0: You got a Jeep.

526
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,720
Speaker 0: It's got a winch on the front.

527
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:19,407
Speaker 1: I don't have a Jeep and I never will.

528
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:22,680
Speaker 0: let's say you do because you're driving off into the wilderness to find the last.

529
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,100
Speaker 0: That's some crazy billionaire hid in the wilderness and you know where it is.

530
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,019
Speaker 0: I'll come up and tell me to tell you're in a Jeep and you get the Jeep stuck in a ditch.

531
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,450
Speaker 0: How do you get the Jeep out of it there?

532
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,759
Speaker 1: I'll leave it there and walk.

533
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:37,963
Speaker 0: All right.

534
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:41,720
Speaker 0: It is you cannot make it out of the wilderness without driving.

535
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:43,626
Speaker 1: I'll call for help on my phone.

536
00:36:43,747 --> 00:36:45,475
Speaker 0: your phone is dead because you're in the middle of the wilderness.

537
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,745
Speaker 1: use a helicopter There's.

538
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:54,031
Speaker 0: you only have a Jeep walk You'll do okay you starve to death before you make it to the edge of the wilderness.

539
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:56,440
Speaker 1: why I deserve it for deepen.

540
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:12,920
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's a naive way to use a winch and a Very smart way to use a winch and this is the kind of practical knowledge that people who do real physical work No But a lot of nerds as much as they think oh I know about a nuclear weapons work and I know how a gun works.

541
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,843
Speaker 0: I know a pulleys work.

542
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:24,379
Speaker 0: There are the practical application of those simple like how to practically apply a lever Not actually that obvious or intuitive to most people and they tend to fuck it up no matter how smart they are.

543
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:30,928
Speaker 1: All right, so I don't know if I've mentioned it on the show before I probably have.

544
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:33,325
Speaker 1: there's a thing called Pico 8.

545
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:40,898
Speaker 1: I think we may have talked about this when we talked about Gamer X at some point because there were some really good Pico 8 games at gamer X when we went in New York.

546
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:42,984
Speaker 0: God that was a long time ago.

547
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:46,574
Speaker 1: Pico 8 is a fantasy game console.

548
00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:48,580
Speaker 1: It doesn't actually exist, right?

549
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:55,000
Speaker 1: They just came up with right this game and there's actually some competitors or not necessarily competitors.

550
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:57,399
Speaker 1: but there's a few of these right where?

551
00:37:58,301 --> 00:38:01,580
Speaker 1: What if a game console existed that had this chip in it?

552
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,340
Speaker 1: Right, so they just make an emulator for a chip that never existed, right?

553
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:11,080
Speaker 1: And it's like you just made a console and now people can make games for that console.

554
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:15,520
Speaker 1: So Pico 8 is one of those that makes games with a particular aesthetic.

555
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:29,957
Speaker 1: But you know and there's been a lot of really high-quality Pico 8 games I've seen in my time Especially on itch.io and but I've discovered this recently because everyone is tweeting about it I think it had maybe a big release or something.

556
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:35,509
Speaker 1: I don't know But What this is is Pico CAD.

557
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:39,040
Speaker 1: It is itself a Pico 8 application.

558
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:43,316
Speaker 1: So you need to run it on a Pico 8 and it will any or on.

559
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:46,313
Speaker 1: you know in your browser You can run the Pico 8 emulator, right?

560
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:46,615
Speaker 1: It's just.

561
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:47,340
Speaker 1: it's just free.

562
00:38:48,869 --> 00:39:00,540
Speaker 1: and then It lets you make a 3d model and sort of color it and texture it as really simple Pixley 3d model that looks like it's from something even less than like a PlayStation 1.

563
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:10,160
Speaker 1: We're talking like Virtua racing from Sega, but maybe with like better color and textures on it And you can't make your model too complex or obviously you start to run out.

564
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,657
Speaker 1: You know hit the limitation the artificial limitations of the Pico 8 console.

565
00:39:13,677 --> 00:39:14,340
Speaker 1: that doesn't exist.

566
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:27,671
Speaker 1: but you can make 3d models of like a particular and awesome aesthetic using Pico CAD and then you can use those tiny models in Perhaps some other Pico software you're gonna use.

567
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:29,840
Speaker 1: it just exports to like totally normal files.

568
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,738
Speaker 1: You can load them into like, you know, whatever.

569
00:39:32,758 --> 00:39:36,172
Speaker 0: well It looks like the most recent update is exporting to OBS and MTL.

570
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:38,220
Speaker 0: so you can import them into like blender and unity.

571
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:39,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get unity.

572
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:39,882
Speaker 1: Yep, you can.

573
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:46,304
Speaker 1: just you can make stuff in Pico CAD and then import it into your actual Outside software.

574
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:49,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, and perhaps I don't know if you can do vice-versa.

575
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:50,260
Speaker 1: I don't know.

576
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:54,669
Speaker 0: This is just looks really cute and easy.

577
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:56,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is is.

578
00:39:56,313 --> 00:40:00,920
Speaker 1: quite imagine if there was like, you know It's almost like a Mario Paint situation, right?

579
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,380
Speaker 1: Where it's like, ah, you can use your Super Nintendo to make Super Nintendo sprites.

580
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,888
Speaker 1: So you can use your Pico 8, you know, you're in quotes your Pico 8 To make Pico 8 models, right?

581
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:12,934
Speaker 0: Has anyone made a physical Pico 8?

582
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:15,422
Speaker 1: I Mean generally.

583
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:19,419
Speaker 1: you can just take like a Raspberry Pi put it into a box and run Pico 8 on it, right?

584
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,835
Speaker 1: So and then you can put Pico 8 ROMs right onto cartridges.

585
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:26,605
Speaker 1: I'm sure someone's done that There's.

586
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:27,740
Speaker 1: there are some competitors.

587
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:34,972
Speaker 1: I forget what they're called because I think Pico 8 itself technically isn't like the open source Like it doesn't cost any money, but I don't think it's open source.

588
00:40:34,992 --> 00:40:36,560
Speaker 1: I'm not sure there's another one.

589
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,009
Speaker 1: I think that is fully open source.

590
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:39,358
Speaker 1: That's a little different but not bad.

591
00:40:39,378 --> 00:40:40,825
Speaker 1: I Look it up.

592
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:41,568
Speaker 0: I don't know.

593
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:44,720
Speaker 0: Yep, but that's it in the meta moment.

594
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:47,880
Speaker 0: We're still stuck at home, but we are reading the tail.

595
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:51,411
Speaker 1: I am reading the tail, but I am progressing.

596
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,535
Speaker 0: Hanzo is done.

597
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,458
Speaker 0: We're back to Genji.

598
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:53,960
Speaker 0: Here we go.

599
00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:07,044
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first novel that has ever existed the first You know literature written by a human that that is in the format known as novel Is the tale of Genji and We are reading that book.

600
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:15,834
Speaker 0: my advice to you so far if you're picking this book up either because you were finally reading it Or because you're a new listener you just you waited until we started reading it before you dove in.

601
00:41:16,195 --> 00:41:29,000
Speaker 0: my advice is if You read like a page or two and you're a little bit confused like you don't know exactly who one of the characters is my advice is to just keep going and You'll kind of figure it out later anyway.

602
00:41:29,121 --> 00:41:33,040
Speaker 1: So it won't matter that like if you don't at the beginning of each chapter at least in the edition.

603
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,439
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It gives you a list of all the characters that are in that scene.

604
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:49,880
Speaker 1: right because you know in there trying to keep with the you know, like I guess more and it's not ancient but you know, The traditional older style Japanese that this is written people are referred to obliquely, right?

605
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,047
Speaker 1: Yes in that old style of language.

606
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:55,935
Speaker 1: People are not always referred to in a clear fashion.

607
00:41:55,975 --> 00:42:02,960
Speaker 1: It would be like if I wrote a Whole something in English and I kept using pronouns all the time, right?

608
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:11,111
Speaker 1: Something or or using other ways to refer to a person like, you know, ah the gamer I just said the gamer every time right and it's like.

609
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:13,300
Speaker 1: well, you know it but it's in a room full of gamers.

610
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:14,919
Speaker 1: Which person are they talking about?

611
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:18,465
Speaker 1: And that's the way there.

612
00:42:18,565 --> 00:42:33,016
Speaker 1: so in trying to keep with that old style language the translation right Uses pronouns and other ways of referring to someone all the time instead of just saying their name often enough Right that you can tell who the hell it is.

613
00:42:34,145 --> 00:42:35,699
Speaker 1: So you have to figure that out?

614
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,387
Speaker 0: But seriously just steamroll through.

615
00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:44,933
Speaker 0: as long as you understand what happened in each scene it all slots together like pretty easily like You'll kind of just get into a groove with it.

616
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:48,407
Speaker 1: Yep So that's that tale again.

617
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:57,242
Speaker 0: G any other meta things whatsoever Mean there's light at the end of the tunnel on the vaccines to the point to where at some point this year There's a chance.

618
00:42:57,282 --> 00:43:01,755
Speaker 0: Scott and I can record something together again, but there's a non-zero chance, but it's.

619
00:43:02,257 --> 00:43:03,822
Speaker 1: uh, you know There's even.

620
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:07,137
Speaker 1: there's even a non-zero convention chance, but it's it's way low.

621
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:14,748
Speaker 0: Yep It gets higher toward the like later in the year like November December definitely But we're talking.

622
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:16,538
Speaker 1: we're talking like lottery tickets here.

623
00:43:16,578 --> 00:43:16,719
Speaker 1: Yep.

624
00:43:17,342 --> 00:43:30,251
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah a lot of projects are on hold until post-covid just because like we've said before It is such a pain in the ass to record a panel In this environment that we have only done it when absolutely forced to.

625
00:43:30,994 --> 00:43:31,154
Speaker 1: yeah.

626
00:43:31,937 --> 00:43:33,020
Speaker 1: All right, so cable management.

627
00:43:33,181 --> 00:43:35,512
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure we did a show on this and you deleted it.

628
00:43:35,693 --> 00:43:35,894
Speaker 1: Yep.

629
00:43:35,974 --> 00:43:48,299
Speaker 0: We did a show in The best I could find September 28th 2017. we did a show on Desks but I poked at it and we seem to almost entirely talk about the form factor of desks themselves.

630
00:43:51,122 --> 00:44:01,300
Speaker 0: And I'm pretty sure I talked a little bit about like rack cable management back in like 2006 but that was back when shows didn't really have topics necessarily.

631
00:44:02,261 --> 00:44:06,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, like we did a show once called games were reviewed like seven tabletop games in a row.

632
00:44:07,842 --> 00:44:13,480
Speaker 1: All right, the point is when it comes to cable management right at least for an everyday or even a technological person.

633
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:18,319
Speaker 1: I really see four four categories right that come to mind in my life, right?

634
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:21,011
Speaker 0: Yep Well, how do you deal with his telepathic powers?

635
00:44:21,232 --> 00:44:22,940
Speaker 0: How do you deal with his telekinetic powers?

636
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,368
Speaker 0: Right my current toad line cable or is he from the future?

637
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:29,233
Speaker 1: right the four instances.

638
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:34,567
Speaker 1: I have to manage cables, right are Inside of a computer.

639
00:44:34,587 --> 00:44:36,419
Speaker 1: you're building a computer this cables in it.

640
00:44:36,921 --> 00:44:40,331
Speaker 1: Right, you're outside your computer around your desk.

641
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:43,100
Speaker 1: You've got your monitors your computer and your mouse your keyboard.

642
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,372
Speaker 1: You gotta wire everything together.

643
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:57,960
Speaker 1: this case to Case three that you're in a data center and there's mostly networking cables, but also power cables and other cables that need Yeah, which if I did professionally for many years, I managed data centers and also like personally pulled cables.

644
00:44:58,381 --> 00:44:59,565
Speaker 0: I can talk about that at length.

645
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:04,120
Speaker 1: and then the fourth one would be of a home a home theater and you're cabling.

646
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:09,640
Speaker 1: You know, you got cables going from the TV to your HD PC to your game consoles to your power outlets talk.

647
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,180
Speaker 1: Alright, there is some other ones that I have not had to do personally.

648
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:17,974
Speaker 0: Like we're not talking about like power met cable management in a house.

649
00:45:18,035 --> 00:45:19,440
Speaker 0: Like that's just home, right?

650
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,065
Speaker 1: You might work at a phone company.

651
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:31,660
Speaker 1: You know, we're not talking about telcos either like you might be in like the the You know stage business theaters you might or concerts and wiring up those sorts of things.

652
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:33,223
Speaker 1: Or your DJ.

653
00:45:33,243 --> 00:45:34,766
Speaker 1: you got a wire that stuff.

654
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:40,108
Speaker 1: but most any you know Serious electronic system of any kind.

655
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,657
Speaker 1: we still depend on wires in 2021 to some degree.

656
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:45,560
Speaker 1: Not everything is wireless.

657
00:45:46,222 --> 00:45:51,537
Speaker 1: So you have to you know, take you know physical, you know lengths of.

658
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:59,729
Speaker 1: you know Some sort of metal in sort of some sort of shielded sheath of some kind with connectors at the end To connect one thing to another thing.

659
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:02,800
Speaker 1: and when it's only one thing to another thing, it's easy.

660
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:04,500
Speaker 1: You just boop boop done, right?

661
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:11,160
Speaker 1: But often you will have several things that need to be connected to several other things in the proximity to each other.

662
00:46:11,723 --> 00:46:14,360
Speaker 1: And if you just connect everything boop boop one at a time.

663
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:16,869
Speaker 1: It will work and it will also be a mess.

664
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:27,378
Speaker 0: you get a desk that looks like what my desk looked like in the early days of geek nights right, so I you got to do some sort of trickery, right?

665
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:41,460
Speaker 1: It's not easy to connect all these wires in such a way that they are a neatly organized Clean and you know pleasing to the eye or perhaps the the you know, the god tier invisible

666
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:47,612
Speaker 0: Like I'll admit someone like think something that bothers me viscerally whenever I see it even though I would never like to say something.

667
00:46:47,652 --> 00:46:48,515
Speaker 0: if I was in someone's house.

668
00:46:48,897 --> 00:47:01,637
Speaker 0: if there's a really nice TV hanging on the wall and Three or four different cables just coming down the wall at three or four random angles coming to its mentor Well, well that might mean that's my TV, but they're all.

669
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:10,579
Speaker 1: yeah My mind that my TV doesn't have a pyramid but they're all just sort of going straight down because it's like that's better than the Inverted pyramid in my mind not by much but it is better.

670
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:12,294
Speaker 1: But I guess mostly just cuz.

671
00:47:12,335 --> 00:47:20,700
Speaker 1: I've got you know I've got the power cable and I've got like three HDMI cables coming out and then I've got for the Wii I've got this component cable.

672
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,625
Speaker 0: Yeah I've already decided how I'm gonna handle that.

673
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:27,018
Speaker 0: I cuz I am gonna hire your guy to mount my TV on the wall.

674
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:36,620
Speaker 0: after kovin I'm gonna actually mount a cable channel inside of the wall and Have a port at the bottom or he maybe even in the other room for I'd like to do that.

675
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,084
Speaker 1: But I don't.

676
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:37,649
Speaker 1: this isn't?

677
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:37,951
Speaker 1: I don't?

678
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:42,992
Speaker 0: I rent I don't own Already cut multiple holes in my walls to run cables.

679
00:47:43,012 --> 00:47:43,374
Speaker 0: You know, I'll do.

680
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:49,604
Speaker 0: when I move out one I might just leave them cuz there's no way the building would notice Like you know through.

681
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:54,624
Speaker 0: oh there's an extra faceplate that looks just like all the faceplates that were there when I moved in over a Decade ago.

682
00:47:54,644 --> 00:47:55,632
Speaker 0: that has some ethernet in it.

683
00:47:55,894 --> 00:47:56,499
Speaker 0: Where does that go?

684
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:03,337
Speaker 1: I mean if If I wasn't renting I would absolutely do that or two.

685
00:48:03,457 --> 00:48:08,539
Speaker 0: if it was a problem All I'll do is just put plaster over it and leave the cables in the wall and just move out.

686
00:48:09,362 --> 00:48:13,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I was yeah, yeah, but well, I think let's go.

687
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:14,380
Speaker 0: but I think we'll go inside out.

688
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,199
Speaker 0: We'll start with inside the computer to work our way out.

689
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:27,114
Speaker 0: but the parameter what we're only talking about semi permanent cable installation because Permanent installation is like I am wiring a house fully and permanently.

690
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:42,691
Speaker 0: like these cables will never move Like that's when you're zip tying cables directly together and like permanently sticking them somewhere gluing them whatever putting them inside of something you can't get them out of but and temporary like if I set up a computer in the living room to do.

691
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,345
Speaker 0: like all the cables I laid to record that panel are Recorded for packs online.

692
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:50,827
Speaker 0: I just let them lay everywhere because as soon as I was done recording I rolled them all up and put them away.

693
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:52,758
Speaker 0: like don't manage those just let it be.

694
00:48:53,724 --> 00:49:02,310
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly inside the computer Counts as semi-permanent because you want it to be nice in there But you don't want to like permanently mount them all somehow.

695
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,320
Speaker 0: because what if you add a new hard drive to your computer?

696
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,709
Speaker 0: What if something breaks or changes?

697
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,860
Speaker 0: like yeah, there's a lot of reasons.

698
00:49:10,422 --> 00:49:16,710
Speaker 0: You might have to go inside your computer and move one of those cables You also you also want to keep them nice to.

699
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:19,180
Speaker 1: so don't restrict or mess up the airflow in the computer.

700
00:49:19,321 --> 00:49:19,722
Speaker 0: it's funny.

701
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,694
Speaker 0: in the old days this actually like you kids are lucky.

702
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:26,926
Speaker 0: computer cable management is Orders of magnitude easier than it used to be.

703
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:29,353
Speaker 0: we used to have these fat ribbon cables.

704
00:49:29,754 --> 00:49:34,651
Speaker 0: They were like two inches wide Yep, and you couldn't even make them smaller.

705
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:40,219
Speaker 0: if you tried to like bundle them together You get signal interference and like your hard drive would get slower or not work.

706
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:42,492
Speaker 1: Yep, they used to sell some.

707
00:49:42,532 --> 00:49:46,550
Speaker 1: that would be like, you know That would be sort of do the inverted pyramid on both ends.

708
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're like the middle was wrapped tight around itself.

709
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:54,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, but those were kind of expensive and sometimes had problems and those came late to the scene later.

710
00:49:55,241 --> 00:49:55,583
Speaker 0: One

711
00:49:55,603 --> 00:50:18,299
Speaker 1: thing that's nice and one thing that's nice nowadays is you might be you know most of the cabling inside of a computer at least, you know in these times is You know If you can make a computer with only m2 drives which I think most people can get away with and maybe have a NAS Then you don't need any of that.

712
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:27,686
Speaker 1: You can just not have hard drives in your computer that are require any cables and you've just taken away So much of the wires in the computer Like in the old days.

713
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:31,100
Speaker 0: you had to plug so much crap in like oh you got a CD drive.

714
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:38,051
Speaker 0: I plug the PETA cable in parallel ATA Plug in the magic cable that made audio come out of it.

715
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:41,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you've only got m2 Drives in your computer.

716
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:46,580
Speaker 1: The only cables you need are basically from the power supply to everything.

717
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:49,396
Speaker 1: and Is that it?

718
00:50:51,563 --> 00:50:56,402
Speaker 0: The stuff that's on the front of your case into the headers on the motherboard Right.

719
00:50:56,442 --> 00:50:58,187
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's the magic.

720
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:16,273
Speaker 0: the thing that changed for all of you isn't just that all this old fuddy-duddy stuff disappeared Like you'll never have to worry about a ribbon cable again in your lives but also cases got way better like computer cases used to just be like No one no one even thought about the user experience of one of these things.

721
00:51:16,334 --> 00:51:21,955
Speaker 0: like you would have to unscrew the entire thing to Like move a hard drive like literally take the whole case apart.

722
00:51:22,277 --> 00:51:26,476
Speaker 0: back in the day Motherboard went straight into the back like there was no room behind the motherboard.

723
00:51:26,496 --> 00:51:30,589
Speaker 0: nowadays Honestly, you know my cable management strategy is buy a nice case.

724
00:51:31,392 --> 00:51:34,280
Speaker 0: it has channels behind the motherboard but inside the case.

725
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, cram everything back there.

726
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,260
Speaker 0: Don't really care if it's ugly cuz no one can see it and it's not in the way.

727
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,847
Speaker 1: Yep, that's what I do too.

728
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:41,630
Speaker 1: It's I do.

729
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:49,338
Speaker 0: there are channels back there with little like Like Multiple sets of channel like it's so fancy channels.

730
00:51:50,762 --> 00:51:52,732
Speaker 1: But basically yeah the way the case is.

731
00:51:52,832 --> 00:51:54,440
Speaker 1: they know what you're gonna be putting in there.

732
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,880
Speaker 1: They know the power supply goes here and such and nowadays power supplies of modular cables.

733
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,844
Speaker 1: You don't need to like.

734
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:05,205
Speaker 1: I used to have all these just cables sitting in the computer because the power supply just had like a big Crazy number of wires come.

735
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:08,015
Speaker 0: I cut them off one of one of my power supplies.

736
00:52:08,035 --> 00:52:09,480
Speaker 1: It could be a little dangerous.

737
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,546
Speaker 1: You got to tie them up, right?

738
00:52:10,606 --> 00:52:11,109
Speaker 0: No, I cut it.

739
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:13,059
Speaker 0: I cut them off and then I terminated the ends.

740
00:52:13,783 --> 00:52:14,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got terminate or something.

741
00:52:14,888 --> 00:52:16,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it is leave the bear cow.

742
00:52:16,435 --> 00:52:17,119
Speaker 0: You gotta hang it out.

743
00:52:17,662 --> 00:52:17,964
Speaker 1: There's.

744
00:52:18,286 --> 00:52:20,320
Speaker 1: uh, you know now they're modular power supplies.

745
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,312
Speaker 1: You only put the few the cables you need and no extras, right?

746
00:52:23,412 --> 00:52:24,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, then you take those.

747
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,042
Speaker 1: they go There's a hole.

748
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:31,200
Speaker 1: there'll be a hole near the near the power supply where those cables can go directly behind the motherboard.

749
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:34,250
Speaker 1: Right because the motherboards aren't mounted on a plate.

750
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:43,720
Speaker 1: then they can go up or sideways or wherever they need to go And then there'll be holes near the places they need to pop out and then directly attached to whatever they need to attach to you.

751
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:48,460
Speaker 1: So it's like ah, there's where the motherboard has its ATX power connector and there's a hole right next to it.

752
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:51,832
Speaker 1: So the power supply cable goes behind where no one can see.

753
00:52:51,873 --> 00:53:00,380
Speaker 1: it pops out in the front connects And then once you've connected everything on that back plate behind the motherboard are like little ties.

754
00:53:00,862 --> 00:53:05,900
Speaker 1: So you can sort of bundle the cables together into little groups, you know, so they're not just you know a mess.

755
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:07,390
Speaker 1: But even if they are a mess doesn't matter.

756
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:08,296
Speaker 1: This is fun.

757
00:53:08,578 --> 00:53:14,086
Speaker 0: Yep In fact, you can even leave a few extra cables back there and tuck the ends out of the way And then you buy a new hard drive.

758
00:53:14,308 --> 00:53:15,877
Speaker 0: Just pull those little ends out plug them in.

759
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:16,259
Speaker 0: good to go.

760
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:24,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, even if you do have you know SATA cables still like I do it's like yeah, you can route them generally with the same kind of method.

761
00:53:24,963 --> 00:53:25,997
Speaker 1: You know depends on your case.

762
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:30,400
Speaker 1: Yeah But just just try to hide as much as you can then your case will look pretty nice.

763
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,454
Speaker 0: Cool thing is a lot of modern no one can see.

764
00:53:32,514 --> 00:53:42,640
Speaker 0: behind the motherboard we'll have a whole separate section in the bottom for basically just the power supply and Usually if you do have giant old spin and hard disks, they usually put racks down there for those too.

765
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,989
Speaker 0: So they're just completely invisible.

766
00:53:44,412 --> 00:53:44,614
Speaker 1: Yep.

767
00:53:44,815 --> 00:53:44,996
Speaker 1: Yep.

768
00:53:45,077 --> 00:53:50,820
Speaker 0: Yep What the listener pointed out the fans fans in the early days when all they just need power.

769
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,711
Speaker 0: It used to be easy cases.

770
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:57,300
Speaker 0: Just didn't have fans usually Mmm, then there's beard fans.

771
00:53:57,341 --> 00:53:58,599
Speaker 0: There's nothing to plug them into.

772
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:00,366
Speaker 0: You'd have to like your motherboard.

773
00:54:00,567 --> 00:54:05,360
Speaker 1: your motherboard has spots for the power to go and if it's a fan that needs power supply power You do the same thing.

774
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,449
Speaker 1: no higher goes back and then it pops out near the fan.

775
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:07,550
Speaker 1: and

776
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:23,660
Speaker 0: the cool thing is most nice cases will come with fans like Already in all the right spots and usually even have cables running through the channels to the place That's likely near where you're gonna have to plug them into the motherboard like standardization happened of all the things that the ATX specification didn't specify.

777
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:30,200
Speaker 0: Kind of naturally and you'll always be able to take advantage of that unless you buy a super shitty off-brand case.

778
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:31,362
Speaker 1: Yep.

779
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:32,426
Speaker 1: All right.

780
00:54:32,446 --> 00:54:36,060
Speaker 1: So the next kind of cable routing let's go to the the TV area, right?

781
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:48,090
Speaker 1: So as room was saying, you know If you've got a situation where the TV itself like mine has like four HDMI cables going into it gives you got to switch it to Nintendo switches and an HD PC and all this stuff, right?

782
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:54,860
Speaker 1: If your TV's on a table of some kind it's not too big a deal, right?

783
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,900
Speaker 1: You can just do sort of normal cable routing right, you know tie things up nicely with cable.

784
00:54:59,943 --> 00:55:09,906
Speaker 0: Yeah all my cables are tied up with cable ties sitting behind the like Entertainment center shelf where unless you really go back there and look like you're not gonna see him Every single cable I have.

785
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:30,978
Speaker 1: I went on the internet a few years ago and I bought a package of like a hundred You know hook and loop for a velcro cable ties and what I did is basically every single cable I owned Except for the ones inside a computer, but even some of the ones in the computer But mostly the outside computer ones USB cables HDMI cables power K all those sort, right?

786
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:39,253
Speaker 1: I any time I came across a cable that did not have a cable tie on it I put a cable tie on it and that cable tie could be used.

787
00:55:39,454 --> 00:55:42,459
Speaker 1: if the cable is put away I'm not using it right now.

788
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:53,780
Speaker 1: I could bundle it up with that little cable tie and if I am using it I can bundle up the slack on the cable with a little cable tie or Combine it with other cables because they all have cable ties, right?

789
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,372
Speaker 1: They can grab on to each other to form a nice cable channel.

790
00:55:57,412 --> 00:56:00,878
Speaker 1: That is nice and clean instead of a spread out You know indecipherable mess.

791
00:56:01,886 --> 00:56:02,638
Speaker 1: So that's step one.

792
00:56:03,563 --> 00:56:07,865
Speaker 1: But if your TV's up on the wall Elevated rim was correct.

793
00:56:07,905 --> 00:56:12,260
Speaker 1: It looks fugly as mine does where the cables are just coming down the wall.

794
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,420
Speaker 0: My best advice is mount as much as you can on the back of the TV.

795
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:27,547
Speaker 0: I see a lot of people do this like they'll mount the TV on the wall But they'll also stick stuff like the power like anything they need to make the TV work or even a tiny HDPC in some cases an Apple.

796
00:56:27,627 --> 00:56:31,260
Speaker 1: an Apple TV can hang on the back of a television really easily.

797
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:31,743
Speaker 1: It's tiny.

798
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:33,454
Speaker 1: my HDPC is too big for that.

799
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:43,472
Speaker 1: Yeah But it would be possible for me if I really wanted to to mount the HDPC on the wall behind the TV.

800
00:56:43,592 --> 00:56:44,275
Speaker 1: it could happen.

801
00:56:44,716 --> 00:56:49,392
Speaker 1: right now You're thinking wait a minute you put more stuff on the wall more stuff on the TV.

802
00:56:49,693 --> 00:56:52,983
Speaker 1: those cables still need to go down Right somewhere.

803
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:57,620
Speaker 1: well no not really because what happens is the HDMI cables are now all in one place, right?

804
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,012
Speaker 1: They're going from the devices on the wall into the television.

805
00:57:01,032 --> 00:57:03,180
Speaker 1: They're all up there already hiding behind the TV.

806
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:05,807
Speaker 1: The power cables need to go somewhere.

807
00:57:05,827 --> 00:57:09,620
Speaker 1: well what you do is you take your power strip, and you put that up there.

808
00:57:09,741 --> 00:57:12,725
Speaker 0: Oh now You just got to get one cable to that TV.

809
00:57:12,746 --> 00:57:21,846
Speaker 1: now the only cable that has to come down from the TV is the Power cable from the power strip and you can hide it in a channel or hide it in the wall Or something else like that.

810
00:57:21,866 --> 00:57:31,691
Speaker 1: if you can't do that you can do a rims doing which is where The cables go into the wall or into a plate that's on the wall Right and then you have sort of down near the floor.

811
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:34,040
Speaker 1: you have some sort of exit where the cables come out.

812
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then that stuff is where you connect to everything else in a hidden fashion.

813
00:57:38,397 --> 00:57:39,080
Speaker 0: I like the plates.

814
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:46,432
Speaker 0: I like the idea of you have plates where like you could like they literally have like HDMI and DisplayPort and USB like ports on them.

815
00:57:46,653 --> 00:57:52,692
Speaker 1: right yeah up on high on the wall HDMI hole you know and on the low on the wall is an HDMI hole.

816
00:57:52,852 --> 00:58:01,562
Speaker 1: inside the wall is an HDMI cable as long as You never have to upgrade that HDMI cable to a newer standard yeah, and even if you do It's only a minor pain in the ass I guess.

817
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:26,779
Speaker 0: but another way to go that actually is a lot easier for people is You might have what one of those two might have the whole like the proper like plug just coming out of the wall usually the One that's the most visible, but on the other end of it usually hidden behind the TV you get a face plate That's basically just an open hole with some stuff to make it easy for cables to like kind of hang there easily And just jam the cables into the wall through that big hole because no one will see the hole

818
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,099
Speaker 1: exactly.

819
00:58:29,142 --> 00:58:30,390
Speaker 1: But yeah, you just want to find.

820
00:58:30,451 --> 00:58:31,699
Speaker 1: it's really about that gap.

821
00:58:31,921 --> 00:58:37,220
Speaker 1: You know that's where the unseemliness is between the TV and the you know because your power outlets are gonna be near the floor.

822
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:46,419
Speaker 1: I guess if you make your own house isn't that you put the power outlets up near the TV And get really fancy right if your TVs on certain kinds of arms for mounting right.

823
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:50,727
Speaker 1: so my Arm doesn't have this too much as a little bit bit But my monitor arms.

824
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:55,329
Speaker 1: in the arm of my monitors There is a channel for cables to go.

825
00:58:55,389 --> 00:58:58,200
Speaker 1: so basically all the cables from the monitor get bundled up.

826
00:58:58,521 --> 00:59:01,850
Speaker 1: They go into this channel, and then they exit at the.

827
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:06,267
Speaker 1: you know where the mom where the the arm clamps right onto the back Of my desk.

828
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:07,136
Speaker 1: they exit there.

829
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:11,460
Speaker 1: So you really you know don't have them just like flopping all over the place.

830
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,997
Speaker 1: It's pretty nice, and you know TVs can do a similar thing.

831
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:19,760
Speaker 1: find You know some sort of channel or pipe or race way or something to for cables to go?

832
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, when in doubt if you're on it's all.

833
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:23,494
Speaker 1: it's about aesthetics right?

834
00:59:23,535 --> 00:59:24,880
Speaker 1: the cables themselves are ugly.

835
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:29,198
Speaker 1: You just trying to hide them yep Them in like a tube.

836
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:36,929
Speaker 0: But as a matter they're actually if you're willing to put up with cutting them to the right length yourself And you're okay with them smelling bad for like a week.

837
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:40,220
Speaker 0: go on Amazon and buy like the cheapest cable channels.

838
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,692
Speaker 0: They usually stick to your wall with like adhesive tape.

839
00:59:43,255 --> 00:59:47,000
Speaker 0: they look fine They just work and they really clean everything up.

840
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,614
Speaker 0: Just get like some black or white ones and just plan them in advance like.

841
00:59:50,635 --> 00:59:56,960
Speaker 0: the only other thing you really got to think about Is plan what you're gonna do before you start sticking stuff in places and how long?

842
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,463
Speaker 1: Lengths right you're gonna need.

843
00:59:58,524 --> 01:00:06,267
Speaker 1: as soon as when you try to organize things into channels that takes because you're not taking a direct route From point A to point B You're routing your go.

844
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:08,120
Speaker 0: cables need to be longer than you might realize.

845
01:00:08,962 --> 01:00:10,747
Speaker 1: You need more length than you realize.

846
01:00:10,767 --> 01:00:15,440
Speaker 1: you have to consider the maximum lengths possible for certain kinds of cables when you're doing this right.

847
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:17,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not any granted.

848
01:00:17,331 --> 01:00:23,613
Speaker 1: You know there's the advertised Specified lengths for different cable standards, and I have never.

849
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:28,028
Speaker 1: I've seen many cables exceed those specs And I've never seen one not work.

850
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,383
Speaker 0: I've seen higher end like later USB.

851
01:00:31,443 --> 01:00:37,126
Speaker 0: that's too long has trouble, but like USB 2 you can make a USB 2 cable Scarily.

852
01:00:37,207 --> 01:00:38,633
Speaker 1: I've seen Ethernet so long.

853
01:00:38,673 --> 01:00:39,899
Speaker 1: it shouldn't have worked, but it worked.

854
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:50,936
Speaker 0: But the thing I got to do is I'm actually gonna mount the dock for the switch on the wall, I think You can do that right next to the TV.

855
01:00:52,002 --> 01:00:54,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are other solutions to get creative for things like that.

856
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:58,223
Speaker 1: you know cuz the the switch itself the bottom of it is just USB-c.

857
01:00:58,243 --> 01:01:04,160
Speaker 1: yeah, so you could do is you could have like you know you could get some third-party switch dock.

858
01:01:04,301 --> 01:01:05,266
Speaker 1: That's like the one I have.

859
01:01:05,307 --> 01:01:07,500
Speaker 1: that's like just like a little adapter kind of guy.

860
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:13,325
Speaker 1: You can hide that and just have a USB-c cable like off in the corner somewhere So you don't even have a switch dock.

861
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:17,562
Speaker 0: or I mean the pro move is I would like to route a few cables like through The ceiling.

862
01:01:17,582 --> 01:01:19,129
Speaker 0: I don't have any place to do this in this apartment.

863
01:01:19,169 --> 01:01:22,106
Speaker 0: obviously like I can't dig it as much as I'm saying I'll dig Into my walls.

864
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:31,999
Speaker 0: I'm not digging into my floor But I would love to run like some USB and a couple other cables From that wall under the floor to like behind the couch.

865
01:01:32,687 --> 01:01:37,072
Speaker 0: So if I'm sitting there I could plug something like say I needed to use a wired controller for some reason.

866
01:01:37,312 --> 01:01:41,059
Speaker 0: just plug it in right there that yep That is like S-tier.

867
01:01:41,842 --> 01:01:47,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to get something from the TV to the couch right the best thing to do is called a raceway.

868
01:01:47,143 --> 01:01:47,899
Speaker 1: You've probably seen it.

869
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,499
Speaker 1: It's basically like a little rubber guy.

870
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:50,883
Speaker 1: That's you know.

871
01:01:51,023 --> 01:01:53,833
Speaker 1: and the point of these is actually more of a safety issue.

872
01:01:53,853 --> 01:02:01,980
Speaker 1: if you're setting up something temporary You'll just use like duct tape to cover cables because people could trip over them when they're running around on the floor, right?

873
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:05,031
Speaker 1: but if you have a more permanent situation where this?

874
01:02:05,131 --> 01:02:10,708
Speaker 1: you know, maybe you're in a conference room in an office and The Kate the conference tables in the middle of the room.

875
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:15,464
Speaker 1: all the cables on the conference table go into the middle down Inside the table.

876
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:19,740
Speaker 1: So the table is clean, but then they have to come out the bottom of the table and they're all together.

877
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:23,216
Speaker 1: But they need to get to the wall and the wall is far away from the table.

878
01:02:23,497 --> 01:02:24,200
Speaker 1: So you have this thing.

879
01:02:24,221 --> 01:02:32,900
Speaker 1: It's a raceway Is what it's called and it's basically just like a little rubber Thing with holes in it and all the cables can go into it on one side and out on the other.

880
01:02:33,302 --> 01:02:36,620
Speaker 1: But when you plop it on the floor, the bottom of it is flat.

881
01:02:36,761 --> 01:02:40,120
Speaker 1: So it lies flat on the floor and the top of it is rounded.

882
01:02:40,421 --> 01:02:52,140
Speaker 1: So if you have like a chair with wheels or a wheelchair Or any sort of thing that needs to you know, move around a person's foot You won't trip over it because it's just a rounded thing on the ground.

883
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:52,341
Speaker 1: Yeah,

884
01:02:52,421 --> 01:03:08,560
Speaker 0: like in our own the old house and beacon to get a cable where we needed because we we tried to run it through The walls but like the interior walls were insulated for some reason like that house was weird but We'd literally just crammed the cables into the corner of the room like kind of into the car where the carpet met the wall.

885
01:03:08,861 --> 01:03:10,185
Speaker 0: I just jammed it under there.

886
01:03:10,246 --> 01:03:14,159
Speaker 0: that actually works pretty well, especially in older houses that have carpet.

887
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:24,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you can go up and over doorways or and unless it's a power cable You can just like run it under your computer the TV or around the desk, right?

888
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,282
Speaker 1: That's the main situation with the desk Computer.

889
01:03:29,443 --> 01:03:33,279
Speaker 1: is it gonna be on the floor or is it gonna be up on the desk, right if it's down on the floor?

890
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:41,329
Speaker 1: Your challenge is the cables that go from up to down right again up, you know Same as the TV situation right from your monitor to the bottom.

891
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:48,040
Speaker 1: My advice is one if you had hands to the bottom However, you're gonna make those transitions, right?

892
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:53,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you can do it get a power strip mounted on your side of the desk go into the other side of the desk.

893
01:03:53,640 --> 01:04:00,959
Speaker 1: So like for example on the right side of my desk, I've got like there's a scanner way over there But my computer is way on the left side of my test.

894
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:08,500
Speaker 1: So I got like an extra long USB cable and need some sort of horizontal path for it to go without just sort of draping.

895
01:04:09,862 --> 01:04:25,778
Speaker 1: so they do make desks that have like channels in the back for things to go horizontally and what you can do then with those is take all the cables that are on the desk and send them into the channel and then Underneath the desk everything exits the horizontal channel where the computer is and goes straight

896
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:25,998
Speaker 0: down.

897
01:04:26,139 --> 01:04:28,358
Speaker 1: Yep And that's a good way to go.

898
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,456
Speaker 0: Now the the cheat mode is if you have a big enough space is you can just buy those.

899
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,629
Speaker 1: I Can't hear him at all.

900
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:41,160
Speaker 0: Oh you finally noticed It's got finally noticed that he couldn't hear that he was not hearing my audio.

901
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:44,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, I finally noticed why I couldn't hear your audio.

902
01:04:44,794 --> 01:04:45,559
Speaker 0: Oh, you can hear me again.

903
01:04:46,662 --> 01:04:48,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I was trying to.

904
01:04:48,698 --> 01:04:56,840
Speaker 1: I Was trying to turn on the hockey game - I didn't want the hockey audio to interfere with the podcast.

905
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:59,891
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't earning because of the way I capture your voice.

906
01:04:59,991 --> 01:05:01,537
Speaker 0: I can't actually turn on the blab seal.

907
01:05:02,018 --> 01:05:03,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Had to.

908
01:05:03,886 --> 01:05:13,237
Speaker 0: I turned off my own headphones Realized I started to talk about cable channels and raceways and stuff and you just didn't?

909
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:14,180
Speaker 0: you just kept talking.

910
01:05:14,564 --> 01:05:15,797
Speaker 0: So I was like, okay, I'll figure it out.

911
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:17,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, I figured it out.

912
01:05:17,892 --> 01:05:18,980
Speaker 1: I turned off my own headphones.

913
01:05:22,023 --> 01:05:26,502
Speaker 0: But one thing you can buy if you got like an older desk that doesn't support any of this stuff as long as you have Space for it.

914
01:05:26,884 --> 01:05:33,440
Speaker 0: You can buy these like wire cages that you stick on the back of your desk and just cram everything into these wire cages.

915
01:05:34,824 --> 01:05:43,218
Speaker 0: the other pro tip is Get a power strip that you can mount and my like if you have it one of those desks that has like a top part In the bottom part.

916
01:05:43,661 --> 01:05:57,799
Speaker 0: seriously mount a power strip in the top part like behind where your monitor is gonna go if you have like because then you can Plug your monitor and anything else on your desk like speakers that needs power Into something also on top of the desk without having more cables going down

917
01:05:58,462 --> 01:05:59,325
Speaker 1: The power strip.

918
01:05:59,365 --> 01:06:06,500
Speaker 1: that is not on the floor again same as with the TV situation as a pro move It keeps the power cables from going right from high to low.

919
01:06:06,661 --> 01:06:11,870
Speaker 1: They could just you know, bring and then weigh the power, you know anything that combines Cables right.

920
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:23,050
Speaker 1: you want to bring the Combining part as close to the things as you can and then just the one cable that comes out of the power strip is the one That makes the long run that where you know is unsightly.

921
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:24,173
Speaker 1: but it's like it's not unsightly.

922
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,096
Speaker 1: It's just one cable.

923
01:06:25,197 --> 01:06:25,718
Speaker 1: No big deal.

924
01:06:25,778 --> 01:06:37,276
Speaker 0: Yeah The other thing I found is that a cheap way even if you don't make a nice clean aesthetic do something to get your cables off the floor, even if they're still a mess.

925
01:06:37,336 --> 01:06:40,387
Speaker 0: that'll save you a Surprising amount of hassle.

926
01:06:40,488 --> 01:06:50,840
Speaker 0: as the years go on like more than you realize Cables that are touching the ground will accumulate dust and grime that is not actually that easy to get rid of Unless you crawl under there and like wipe them down periodically.

927
01:06:51,282 --> 01:06:52,770
Speaker 1: It's also hard to like vacuum like you ever.

928
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,036
Speaker 1: take your vacuum and you go down there.

929
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:54,700
Speaker 1: It's just cables.

930
01:06:54,921 --> 01:06:58,133
Speaker 0: You know vacuum are you trying to sweep and you know and they're touching the ground.

931
01:06:58,173 --> 01:07:00,323
Speaker 0: you might like sweep a cable out from under Your desk.

932
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:00,969
Speaker 0: Oh fuck.

933
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:02,059
Speaker 0: What was that even plugged into?

934
01:07:02,841 --> 01:07:06,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, so my cable game right now on my my desk is kind of good.

935
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,473
Speaker 1: it's like the best I've had it but it's not perfect right because I've got some.

936
01:07:10,674 --> 01:07:15,258
Speaker 1: I got some speaker cables going up to the Ceiling way above to a high shelf and they're not hidden at all.

937
01:07:15,801 --> 01:07:19,451
Speaker 1: They're just you know, they're they're tied together, but it's still not that great.

938
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:22,540
Speaker 0: I've got a horizontal while on my desk.

939
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:27,000
Speaker 1: I've hidden everything but once you go underneath the desk, it's hideous, right?

940
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,172
Speaker 0: So Emily's all that in a way, you know, she did under the desk.

941
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:35,760
Speaker 0: She put her computer back Like straight behind where her feet are and turned it sideways.

942
01:07:35,941 --> 01:07:41,339
Speaker 0: So the glass and all the bling is pointing out and all the cables are just behind the computer where no one can see them.

943
01:07:42,844 --> 01:07:45,947
Speaker 1: No, maybe but yeah I think I'm gonna basically make a little plan.

944
01:07:46,067 --> 01:07:49,480
Speaker 1: figure out everything every wire like a little piece of paper.

945
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:55,120
Speaker 1: Right the length I need for each one maybe buy some accessories, right and then yeah the play.

946
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,007
Speaker 0: I guess that's the advice for all of this.

947
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:00,320
Speaker 0: make a plan like literally sit down with a piece of paper.

948
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,178
Speaker 0: Look at your desk.

949
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:06,940
Speaker 0: Didn't like write down all the things that need to be plugged in and what they need to be plugged into and draw?

950
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:09,039
Speaker 0: Where are these cables gonna run?

951
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,605
Speaker 0: how do I want this to look like?

952
01:08:10,826 --> 01:08:21,180
Speaker 0: the more you plan in advance the more you can get the right tools to do the Job, and even if you do something kind of inelegant and hackish You'll at least have a plan going in and it'll turn out way better.

953
01:08:21,783 --> 01:08:26,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you go online look at examples of what other people have done There isn't like one best way.

954
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,479
Speaker 1: But there are people who have like setups where like you don't see any wires at all.

955
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of those people are doing stuff like wireless mouse keyboard and you know.

956
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:39,319
Speaker 0: So a lot of those people live in not New York, so they have a slightly bigger area to work with than I do.

957
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:41,023
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

958
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:44,274
Speaker 1: They have less constraints and whatnot or they can modify their walls.

959
01:08:44,295 --> 01:08:46,522
Speaker 1: Yes like that, but You can.

960
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:52,057
Speaker 1: you can go really and get pretty fancy and learn from what other people have done with fancy setups.

961
01:08:52,136 --> 01:08:56,019
Speaker 1: and you know It's just like it's nice to not have wires everywhere.

962
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,564
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

963
01:08:57,823 --> 01:09:02,278
Speaker 1: It just you know, just I even if you just personally you're just like I don't care.

964
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:04,796
Speaker 1: It's like I don't understand that.

965
01:09:05,862 --> 01:09:08,479
Speaker 1: It's like it just feels better to have things be clean.

966
01:09:08,627 --> 01:09:08,733
Speaker 1: Yep

967
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:24,014
Speaker 0: and then when I add something to my setup or change something it's like everything's a lot more modular and easy to work with which Scales up to and we won't talk about this very long because we've got on plenty of time Serious cable management which you can have a full-time job doing and it'll pay pretty well

968
01:09:24,154 --> 01:09:25,578
Speaker 1: right in in the data center.

969
01:09:25,698 --> 01:09:26,582
Speaker 0: that matter.

970
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,170
Speaker 0: it's basically all the concerns like even aesthetics.

971
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:49,979
Speaker 0: aesthetics actually matter to a degree in that kind of environment, but The key the real reason you organize the more serious professional stuff Is that you need to be able to very quickly fix something that went wrong add something remove something change something understand something and You might know where all the stupid cables on your computer go.

972
01:09:50,643 --> 01:09:57,558
Speaker 0: But if someone else comes over to your desk to try to deal with it like something breaks How well are they gonna do if your cables aren't organized?

973
01:09:57,859 --> 01:09:57,960
Speaker 0: now?

974
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:01,678
Speaker 0: Imagine if that desk is a bunch of servers that are doing something important.

975
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:09,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like no one has to understand right how my TV is set up right and it's like only I do

976
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:21,060
Speaker 0: like if I was on a long business trip and Emily had to like Use my computer to recable everything to make geek nights happen like worst case scenario Unplug everything figure it out plug it all back in like, okay fine.

977
01:10:22,203 --> 01:10:26,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not that many but if you're in a data center It's like you have to know every.

978
01:10:26,258 --> 01:10:32,620
Speaker 1: you know Some whoever's working there has to be able to tell what the hell's going on Even though they weren't involved in setting it up at all.

979
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:37,160
Speaker 0: I don't think I ever touched what the things I used to set up when this was my job.

980
01:10:37,582 --> 01:10:38,546
Speaker 0: I would never touch again.

981
01:10:38,566 --> 01:10:41,620
Speaker 0: other people I never met would touch them if there was a problem.

982
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:44,587
Speaker 0: So I had to make sure it was perfect.

983
01:10:45,169 --> 01:10:46,995
Speaker 0: and my advice to you professionally.

984
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:50,653
Speaker 0: there is honestly one Learn from whoever you're working with.

985
01:10:50,673 --> 01:10:58,056
Speaker 0: if you work in a data center It'll be obvious immediately if they're doing a good job or a bad job with this.

986
01:10:58,116 --> 01:11:02,900
Speaker 0: if they're going doing a good job Figure out who made it a good job and learn from them and do whatever they're doing.

987
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:11,967
Speaker 0: Like don't don't try to reinvent the wheel that the things you might think are an obvious good idea are not for reasons that you Won't know right away if they're doing a bad job.

988
01:11:12,308 --> 01:11:13,772
Speaker 0: You have to make a very important decision.

989
01:11:14,514 --> 01:11:16,078
Speaker 0: Do you care or not?

990
01:11:17,901 --> 01:11:23,928
Speaker 0: Because if you don't care don't touch it because as soon as you touch it or talk about it You're gonna be asked to fix it.

991
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:26,220
Speaker 0: and that gets to my final piece of advice.

992
01:11:27,721 --> 01:11:34,500
Speaker 0: If I was tasked with setting up a new rack like a like, you know a standard computer rack fully loaded.

993
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:35,811
Speaker 0: So there's like I don't know 20 40 units.

994
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:41,399
Speaker 0: So say there's four switches and 20 computers and some other bullshit in there.

995
01:11:42,202 --> 01:11:55,398
Speaker 0: I would budget for myself if I was cabling that up and doing nice cable management for full working days Eight hours times four to do those cables, right?

996
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:08,927
Speaker 0: Mmm, it takes a long time to do it, right and However long you think it's gonna take unless you have been doing it a long time just triple whatever you think and that's the estimate You should go with those four days

997
01:12:08,947 --> 01:12:12,160
Speaker 1: because are including the time it takes to plan it out, right?

998
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:18,340
Speaker 1: It could be a situation usually where it's been planned out and you're just making many racks that are all the same.

999
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll take four days right but the the planning part, right?

1000
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,015
Speaker 1: It's like okay the rack will have this and this and this and this and the wires go here.

1001
01:12:25,035 --> 01:12:29,580
Speaker 0: that will tell you some amount Of time and especially it depends on like yeah Are you just adding like rack?

1002
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:34,096
Speaker 0: 11 to a rat like they're just adding ten more computers of the same kind at the end of a row.

1003
01:12:34,538 --> 01:12:41,329
Speaker 0: or is it like this is a bespoke rack or like you're doing your own thing or Did someone do a bad job and you've been asked to fix it.

1004
01:12:41,751 --> 01:12:44,220
Speaker 0: that task is almost impossible.

1005
01:12:45,261 --> 01:12:50,940
Speaker 1: Also, the one last thing about data centers, is that like, you know, there's messy data center obviously, right?

1006
01:12:51,321 --> 01:12:54,074
Speaker 1: And then there's you look at one that looks really nice.

1007
01:12:54,114 --> 01:12:55,360
Speaker 1: You know, you got all these networking cables.

1008
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:04,640
Speaker 1: They're going into a nice these channels in between the racks Right, and then they come out the bottom and then they're routed through the floorboards and they're you know standard good job data center.

1009
01:13:05,563 --> 01:13:07,229
Speaker 1: It seems like every couple of years.

1010
01:13:07,309 --> 01:13:14,480
Speaker 1: I'll see a picture of some data center that is doing something That's just like new and incredible and different with your cable man.

1011
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,308
Speaker 0: Well, cuz they're so much has changed.

1012
01:13:17,348 --> 01:13:17,489
Speaker 0: like.

1013
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:21,320
Speaker 1: there are so many new developments in this area.

1014
01:13:21,621 --> 01:13:22,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

1015
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:25,332
Speaker 0: you'll have a whole row of racks that are all direct DC power.

1016
01:13:25,352 --> 01:13:28,120
Speaker 0: There's no AC power fucking anywhere, right?

1017
01:13:28,422 --> 01:13:30,356
Speaker 1: It's like and you know, that's not even that new.

1018
01:13:30,376 --> 01:13:37,360
Speaker 1: so If you are in an existing data center, you only have to get it up to the good level.

1019
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,647
Speaker 1: That's all that you know, it's like.

1020
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:40,880
Speaker 1: is that how much better is that better level?

1021
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:52,351
Speaker 1: But if you're making a new data center Right from nothing you should go and find out the best and the fanciest one and then make sure the whole place Follows the same, you know stuff.

1022
01:13:52,472 --> 01:13:56,086
Speaker 1: even if you're doing different things in different areas Consistency is key.

1023
01:13:56,267 --> 01:14:05,260
Speaker 0: if you're like literally down to the level of This kind of tat like this kind of networking will be on green wires and this other kind will be on blue wires.

1024
01:14:07,121 --> 01:14:10,811
Speaker 0: Like the more standards and like consistency you can make the better.

1025
01:14:10,831 --> 01:14:14,120
Speaker 0: this has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
