1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,307
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Monday, February 8th.

2
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:12,009
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:16,160
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight three news's and cosmos.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,858
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:33,590
Speaker 0: You know, we would have started recording the show a little while ago.

6
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:39,795
Speaker 0: We were full of energy ready to run and uh Scott said he had a news and then he forgot it within a second.

7
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:41,060
Speaker 1: You also forgot it.

8
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:42,789
Speaker 0: I don't think you even said it out loud.

9
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,714
Speaker 0: I think I did.

10
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:44,820
Speaker 0: I don't believe it existed.

11
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:49,397
Speaker 1: I said I will use X news and then like a tab closed and I tried to do.

12
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,392
Speaker 1: you know Undo closed tab and I it.

13
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:54,988
Speaker 1: it opened all these tabs but none of them was the news.

14
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:02,340
Speaker 1: and then I looked in the history and Nothing, the history did not contain the news and then I went to all the news sites and I couldn't find the news anywhere.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:12,640
Speaker 1: So obviously you created a fake news using some sort of HTTP proxy that you then disabled And that is why I had a news and then it disappeared.

16
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:16,378
Speaker 0: Well, it must have been some pretty good news if you had so much to say about.

17
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:16,780
Speaker 0: I did.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,490
Speaker 1: It was a good news, but then I lost it.

19
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,899
Speaker 1: So now I had to pick another news.

20
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:22,019
Speaker 0: You know, are you sure it was a news?

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,040
Speaker 1: Nothing I had a news it just disappeared.

22
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:35,039
Speaker 0: So we really you know I wanted to talk about the robot car and I wanted to talk about the new DARPA project that is effectively the human instrumentality project.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:47,290
Speaker 0: but I got to talk about 4chan because it's one of those things that Almost became the big news that we would had to do a whole show on and luckily just now we learned that once again It's not I mean for anyone who wasn't paying attention.

24
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,234
Speaker 1: This isn't that new.

25
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,739
Speaker 1: I mean this happened once before.

26
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:53,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, well things like this happen on a fairly regular basis.

27
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,440
Speaker 0: every time they do there's a little like immediate puff of internet outrage.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:08,604
Speaker 0: Just people go it's happening It's time and people are like getting super riled up ready to like start DDO s-ing the companies involved now that usually do usually do In the very well fortune.

29
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,750
Speaker 0: they talk about it as opposed to do now.

30
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:12,655
Speaker 1: fortune does it not?

31
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:23,999
Speaker 0: not immediately takes him a long time mmm, but basically a Verizon wireless started blocking fortune at some point and Fortune, you know people were like, hey what's going on?

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:32,699
Speaker 0: And usually when something like this happens people immediately cry foul and then within a few hours It is pointed out that no this was actually a technical problem and it was resolved or no?

33
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:34,360
Speaker 0: This is blown way out of proportion.

34
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:43,500
Speaker 0: There was an outage in this part of the internet and we fixed it But fortune stayed down and of course the people who run fortune are the fortune kind of people who would you know?

35
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:47,197
Speaker 0: So they went to 18th or I keep saying 18th horizon.

36
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's Verizon wireless only which means if you have FiOS, which is Verizon or Verizon DSL, you're cool.

37
00:02:54,261 --> 00:03:02,528
Speaker 1: It's only if you're trying to like use your droid to visit fortune or you have an evdo card on Verizon And you're trying to go to fortune on your laptop.

38
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:07,428
Speaker 0: You know, I don't think anyone calls it evdo except us Evdio, yeah, whatever.

39
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,620
Speaker 0: I think we're the only people who call it evdo in the whole world.

40
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,900
Speaker 1: If you're trying to use your Verizon evdo card with your laptop, you cannot go to fortune.

41
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:15,509
Speaker 0: I know I kind of like evdo you can't.

42
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,988
Speaker 1: you can do it with a proxy because you just you know Like a tour or something.

43
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,840
Speaker 1: You just can't go directly to fortune.

44
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:25,559
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know they went to Verizon wireless and Verizon wireless basically said, you know what?

45
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,458
Speaker 0: Yes We are straight-up blocking what you were talking about due to something.

46
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:35,898
Speaker 1: now Why is Verizon wireless doing it but not the other Verizon whose decision was this why etc.

47
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:36,079
Speaker 1: etc.

48
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,083
Speaker 1: No one knows.

49
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:39,534
Speaker 0: so, you know this kept going on and I ignored it.

50
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:41,486
Speaker 0: and when I saw the news again I thought wait a minute.

51
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,960
Speaker 0: Maybe it's for real happening.

52
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,236
Speaker 0: Maybe an ISP is straight-up blocking something and thus opening a can of worms that anything is.

53
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,746
Speaker 1: they probably block thousands of things.

54
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:57,693
Speaker 1: the thing is all of those things they block are things that Nobody ever goes to or notices or cares that they're dead that they're blocked.

55
00:03:57,713 --> 00:04:00,060
Speaker 0: Well, there's also a difference between blocking apart.

56
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,360
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of people block SMTP or anything like that.

57
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,154
Speaker 0: Not it's not cool to block a specific website specific port.

58
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,140
Speaker 0: that's the kind of thing that really shouldn't happen.

59
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,904
Speaker 0: I mean, that's the web.

60
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:12,371
Speaker 0: people don't block port 80.

61
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:24,676
Speaker 0: That's port 80 is like the one port They're almost guaranteed to be able to get out on Mmm, so of course people started crying crazy foul as this continued in there for Janice preparing a vicious retaliation.

62
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,417
Speaker 0: Before any of you think up it's time.

63
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:33,220
Speaker 0: Verizon through their policy blog issued an official statement explaining exactly what's going on.

64
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,923
Speaker 1: What did they say?

65
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:35,712
Speaker 0: Oh, they talk a little bit first about.

66
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:40,270
Speaker 0: I'm gonna skip all this boilerplate But what's the most important thing we offer our network.

67
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:48,136
Speaker 0: when our network is attacked or at risk of attack in any way that can Harm the customers ability to make and receive calls or use wireless multimedia and data services.

68
00:04:48,397 --> 00:04:49,340
Speaker 0: We jump into action.

69
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:59,845
Speaker 0: recently Verizon Wireless security and external experts detected attacks from an IP address associated with the 4chan family of websites that Disrupted to our customers and our network.

70
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:04,136
Speaker 0: to protect both we eliminated connectivity to this IP IP address.

71
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:06,818
Speaker 0: at no time was 4chan itself blocked.

72
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:11,880
Speaker 1: Now the IP address is basically the 4chan server.

73
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,729
Speaker 0: Well boards dot 4chan org, I believe whatever.

74
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:19,259
Speaker 0: that is that IP address was blocked but not 4chan org see.

75
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,216
Speaker 1: So basically what happened is the IP address that boards of 4chan org that was resolves to.

76
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:29,719
Speaker 0: there were attacks Emanating from that IP address or at least which appeared to be emanating from that IP address.

77
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:37,400
Speaker 0: now I'm not gonna read the rest of this but basically they say that it was some sort of why I'm about to answer the question that you keep asking.

78
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:45,367
Speaker 0: So basically it was some sort of sweep attack that was targeting every wireless device on the Verizon Network To try to get it to respond.

79
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:48,519
Speaker 0: It was kind of like a port scan of wireless devices.

80
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:56,764
Speaker 0: so they basically cut that off from the wireless network to prevent this from happening because it was actually causing drop calls and Some crazy network outage.

81
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:57,666
Speaker 0: It was only getting worse.

82
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:01,957
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and they expect to restore connectivity now that whatever this attack was has ceased.

83
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:02,558
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

84
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,580
Speaker 0: So while everyone expected the can of worms of up a major ISP is blocking a major website for no good reason.

85
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:16,639
Speaker 0: now they at least had a pretty obvious technical reason and they seem to have been pretty straightforward about it open about it.

86
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:24,720
Speaker 0: and if Supposedly are going to resolve the issue though as the time as of the time of this episode They have not yet unblocked this IP address.

87
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:25,984
Speaker 1: It does seem like them.

88
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:32,006
Speaker 1: or the last time when AT&T block fortune is because a DDoS is emanating from fortune fortune.

89
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:39,379
Speaker 1: guys like When you're doing your hacks and attacks don't do them from your fucking web server.

90
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:42,792
Speaker 1: See them from somewhere else so that you're wet.

91
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:45,100
Speaker 1: your awesome website does not get blocked.

92
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,552
Speaker 1: Well, we'll get some other computer somewhere to send your attacks from.

93
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:56,137
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure the last time something like this happened It was that people posted links to things on fortune and that individual is the AT&T.

94
00:06:56,157 --> 00:07:02,820
Speaker 1: when they blocked fortune It was because a DDoS was emanating from fortune but short of an exploit on fortune.

95
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:07,359
Speaker 0: That is not something that I expect the people who run fortune to have actually done.

96
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:12,640
Speaker 1: Well, something is happening on the fortune servers that it is attacking things.

97
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:18,240
Speaker 1: So they got to do something with their security or stop doing attacks from their web servers or something.

98
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,748
Speaker 1: Well, I see I clearly that is the problem.

99
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:24,680
Speaker 1: clearly the content on fortune is not the cause of any of these blockages.

100
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:34,297
Speaker 0: See, I highly doubt however Scott that these attacks actually Legitimately originated from the fortune server in a capacity that was known to or encouraged by the admins.

101
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:38,018
Speaker 0: I would possible I would wager there's only two about three possibilities.

102
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,789
Speaker 0: a Verizon wireless is totally lying.

103
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,814
Speaker 1: That's true possible.

104
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,040
Speaker 0: Yeah possible not probable.

105
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,138
Speaker 0: But you know, I gotta throw it out there too that fortune is straight up behind this and it's trying to cover the butts.

106
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,899
Speaker 0: or Three fortune servers were somehow compromised.

107
00:07:54,423 --> 00:08:04,659
Speaker 1: it could be that there's a lot of computers behind that IP address with some sort of net, you know, and One of them was sending out these attacks and fortune also happened to be behind the same net.

108
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,074
Speaker 0: now You see there is in fact a Spanish Inquisition fourth option.

109
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:25,739
Speaker 0: I Was gonna play the music there and I decided The Fourth option is that someone it did some sort of network Exploit or there are a lot of weird ways you can do this to spoof an attack as having come from fortune In order to get them in trouble or to mask the true origin of the attack.

110
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:26,224
Speaker 1: That's true.

111
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:27,739
Speaker 1: If you just send out an attack, right?

112
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:31,660
Speaker 1: It could have been like some fortune person sending out an attack from their house, right?

113
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:33,719
Speaker 1: But they don't want to be traced back to their house.

114
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,823
Speaker 1: So they're just like.

115
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:38,840
Speaker 1: I need an IP address to put in these TCP IP packets as the return address.

116
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,139
Speaker 1: I'll use the fortune IP address law.

117
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,207
Speaker 0: Now the thing is that there's no.

118
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:44,853
Speaker 1: that's the signature that they know.

119
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:46,820
Speaker 1: this attack is a fortune attack thing is one.

120
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,131
Speaker 0: There's no kind of simple way a script kitty can do that.

121
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:52,820
Speaker 0: spoofing TCP traffic over the internet like it's difficult.

122
00:08:53,060 --> 00:09:00,120
Speaker 0: You need to guess complicated numbers with advanced math or you have to use very specific exploits at certain levels of the infrastructure.

123
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,320
Speaker 0: It's not that easy and to the modus operandi of fortune is not typically an attack like this.

124
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,260
Speaker 0: I mean, it really doesn't fit with what any of those anonymous people would do or say they would do or even anyone associated with Them.

125
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,574
Speaker 0: they would attack like Scientology or they would attack like some perceived enemy.

126
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:29,706
Speaker 0: where they really do this very calculated and business-like exploit of Wireless customers for the very specific purpose likely of attacking people's wireless devices later It doesn't make sense.

127
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:32,679
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that fortune had nothing to do with this.

128
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:37,072
Speaker 0: I accept possibly having very lax or poor security on their side.

129
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:39,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, or just you know, the NAT situation.

130
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,619
Speaker 1: You know, they might be on some sort of hosting and someone else is also back there and that someone else is doing stuff.

131
00:09:45,382 --> 00:10:00,018
Speaker 0: yeah, it's really hard to say but it kind of bothers me that Verizon released the statement and 4chan supposedly had been in contact with Verizon and yet the 4chan status page still basically says yeah Verizon confirm They're blocking us screw them.

132
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:05,255
Speaker 1: What I don't understand is why people just block an IP address, right?

133
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:10,740
Speaker 1: Why don't you actually Specifically block the attacking packets and not any other packets?

134
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:11,887
Speaker 0: Well, what are you gonna do?

135
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:12,893
Speaker 0: a deep packet inspection.

136
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:17,160
Speaker 0: that sort of stuff is not Necessarily easy to do and tends to consume a lot of resources.

137
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:22,118
Speaker 1: Well, basically what it would do right is your routers would just let through anything from a different IP address.

138
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:27,240
Speaker 1: just fine But anything that's from that IP address would be slowed down as it was inspected

139
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:28,722
Speaker 0: 4chan

140
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:37,150
Speaker 1: would slow down but it would still be okay and the attack would cease to disrupt the network and it would probably just cost You like one piece of hardware to accomplish this.

141
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,960
Speaker 0: now that sort of thing is not feasible to implement quickly.

142
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:44,148
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

143
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,660
Speaker 1: I could I could write it pretty easily.

144
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:46,544
Speaker 0: Yes, you're gonna.

145
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:47,488
Speaker 0: what are you gonna write it on?

146
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:51,066
Speaker 0: you're gonna make it like a Linux running device that you put between everything On your network.

147
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:52,195
Speaker 1: No, I just be one computer.

148
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:55,008
Speaker 0: All right Well, how does the router know what to write like?

149
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:55,791
Speaker 0: does it put in?

150
00:10:55,851 --> 00:11:03,244
Speaker 1: I put in one route that says if coming from This computer route to this other computer that I just plugged in All right I'm putting in a new route.

151
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:12,772
Speaker 0: while that is trivial on a large network and a large infrastructure is not something you want to do Lightly let alone statically That's true, but you're only doing it.

152
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:15,363
Speaker 0: one spot Just got believe me.

153
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:20,300
Speaker 0: That's sort of that sort of response is not nearly as useful or effective as the blanket ban.

154
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:22,367
Speaker 1: People just lazy.

155
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,200
Speaker 1: now Rison's got money.

156
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:28,050
Speaker 0: All right, they can handle it But it's not a matter of having money to handle its matter of.

157
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:30,440
Speaker 0: they don't have infrastructure in place to have that selected.

158
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:31,971
Speaker 1: They got the best infrastructure.

159
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:33,340
Speaker 1: Everyone else is in the shitter.

160
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,880
Speaker 1: So if they get the structure is so awesome, they should be able to do it, but they don't have that infrastructure in place.

161
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,185
Speaker 0: There's no reason to have it in place.

162
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:47,071
Speaker 1: for you know, blocking attacks like this without you know, they block the attack trivially Yeah, but they also blocked other things badly.

163
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:55,725
Speaker 1: Yes one thing with a minor disruption of service That were blocked on that are on that IP address if my net theory is correct but only 4chan things.

164
00:11:55,805 --> 00:12:08,614
Speaker 0: and if if the attack was calm still I'm of the mind as an IT professional that the Cut the isolate and attack response to major Outages or major attacks from foreign IPS or whatever is perfectly valid.

165
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:12,435
Speaker 0: if you're getting attacked by something cut it off immediately And then figure out what's going on?

166
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:22,400
Speaker 1: Mmm, whatever the point is is that You know 4chan is not getting blocked for content reasons as people like to jump to that conclusion.

167
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:33,549
Speaker 1: It is being blocked for other reasons, which are You know in some way or another for at least partially possibly very much So 4chan's fault and they got to do something about it.

168
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,500
Speaker 0: I still attribute incompetence as opposed to outright malice.

169
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:37,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not.

170
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:38,530
Speaker 1: I mean look at 4chan.

171
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,106
Speaker 1: These people are not genius webmasters All right.

172
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,140
Speaker 0: So do you have some sort of news?

173
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,180
Speaker 0: Captain can't actually come up with this news because he made it up and then had to stall for time.

174
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:56,480
Speaker 1: Well, because I could not find my news I just went to the sort of the default big news of the week, which is the Amazon book fighting what what's right?

175
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:03,806
Speaker 1: The story basically is that you know, Apple comes out with their iPad and they're like, yeah Our ebooks are gonna be $15.

176
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:08,061
Speaker 1: Meanwhile Kindle books are $10.

177
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:18,320
Speaker 1: So the book publishers are like hey Amazon You better make those books $15 and not $10 like you are now and Amazon's like oh really?

178
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,803
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

179
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:24,300
Speaker 1: Not only are we taking all your books off the Kindle, but we're taking all your book books off Amazon.

180
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,218
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do about that?

181
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw that the so at least one artist guild actually put up some sort of notification system.

182
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,290
Speaker 0: They call they're calling like where'd my buy button go?

183
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:43,420
Speaker 0: so they can inform authors that hey Amazon took your book off for sale because they're strong-arming us because we're Greedy and we want to be able to charge more money for your books, even though you don't see any of that money.

184
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:55,377
Speaker 1: I think the big problem here is that basically if you look at the like the the commentary on the internet Amazon is like taking all the heat like everyone's like oh Amazon you failed Oh Amazon.

185
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:56,420
Speaker 1: You sucked, right?

186
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,424
Speaker 0: I'm 80% on Amazon.

187
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:01,352
Speaker 1: So I am so an Amazon made the consumer play.

188
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:04,100
Speaker 1: They're like look right you sell us books.

189
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:07,824
Speaker 1: We don't care what we pay you for the books, you know It's a wholesale deal.

190
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:10,133
Speaker 1: and then we charge whatever the fuck we want.

191
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:11,880
Speaker 1: We're gonna charge what's best for consumers.

192
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,208
Speaker 1: Well, see here's the right, you know, this is the thing.

193
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:20,490
Speaker 1: anyone who is in favor of a non Consumer centric policy fuck you.

194
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:23,460
Speaker 1: buyer is number one seller is number two.

195
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:28,320
Speaker 0: This is a much more complex issue and this ebook thing makes it all techie and people suddenly care about it.

196
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:31,219
Speaker 0: But this has been going on forever and the root issue is that?

197
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:39,820
Speaker 0: Manufacturers will often put forth some sort of quote minimum advertised price and they'll basically say Apple is like the king of that.

198
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:47,249
Speaker 0: They'll say to anyone who wants to sell and this you know affects gaming to like the Warhammer stuff is Big one - yeah and even TVs.

199
00:14:47,630 --> 00:15:00,560
Speaker 0: so they'll have a minimum advertised price and they'll basically say Anyone who advertises a price lower than the minimum price we allow you to advertise We will never sell you any product to then resell again.

200
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:03,360
Speaker 1: This is why iPods are never at a discount ever.

201
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:09,760
Speaker 1: They're always a certain price because if you try to sell an iPod for like 50 bucks Apple just won't give you any more iPods.

202
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,660
Speaker 0: Now the thing is there's a lot of consumer protection laws in place such that They can't bar you from selling things at the lower price.

203
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:26,766
Speaker 0: You can sell something or whatever price you want unless you sign a specific Contract and even then those contracts if you do them wrong could very easily be construed as some sort of trust Or some sort of price collusion.

204
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:27,148
Speaker 0: Yep.

205
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:27,991
Speaker 0: So what they'll do?

206
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:29,336
Speaker 0: like the TV I bought?

207
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,231
Speaker 0: I bought a super awesome 52-inch TV for the house.

208
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:43,069
Speaker 0: They're all the apartment and The TV retails for like three grand but the what I bought it for was like $1,300.

209
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:45,923
Speaker 0: but the minimum advertised price was like $1,600.

210
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:55,460
Speaker 0: so I go to Amazon and I see a worse TV for like $1,600 and then I see this much much better TV, which a mutt with a much higher retail price.

211
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:57,259
Speaker 0: But Amazon won't show me a price.

212
00:15:57,742 --> 00:16:00,695
Speaker 0: In fact, it has a little icon saying we're not allowed to show you the price.

213
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:01,840
Speaker 0: dude a whole bunch of bullshit.

214
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,560
Speaker 0: Click here to find out about the bullshit and find out who to complain to.

215
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,040
Speaker 1: So I click on it and then it tells you the price.

216
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:08,144
Speaker 0: Nope and click on it.

217
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:14,833
Speaker 0: and it tells me why they can't tell me the price why Samsung is an asshole for making them such that they can't show me the price.

218
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:18,048
Speaker 0: and they say to get around all this BS Put it in your cart.

219
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,239
Speaker 0: say you want to buy it at checkout You'll see the real price and then if you don't want to buy it go ahead and back out.

220
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:24,727
Speaker 0: So I do this.

221
00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:26,420
Speaker 0: and the TV was stupidly cheap.

222
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:27,135
Speaker 1: So I bought it.

223
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:38,064
Speaker 0: Yeah but the fact that Samsung has the power to force Amazon not to show a price that they're perfectly willing to sell this TV for is Ludicrous and laughable.

224
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:46,719
Speaker 1: the other problem here right is that the the internet basically has Especially if you're selling digital goods as opposed to physical goods.

225
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,929
Speaker 1: Middlemen are obsolete.

226
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,355
Speaker 1: all middlemen are 100% useless, right?

227
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,890
Speaker 1: So what we have here right is get this book publisher.

228
00:16:54,453 --> 00:17:07,880
Speaker 1: in terms of publishing physical books middlemen still have a purpose because they can provide services of printing and You know putting getting your stuff onto the shelves and borders and all that kind of stuff that they you know services they can provide.

229
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:14,618
Speaker 1: Thus, you know Validating the fact that they get a cut of the sales and the author doesn't just get a hundred percent.

230
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:19,894
Speaker 1: But if you were selling an e-book the bay the publisher is pretty useless.

231
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:20,817
Speaker 1: What can they do for you?

232
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:22,060
Speaker 1: advertise advertise?

233
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:23,726
Speaker 1: But you can just why?

234
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:24,829
Speaker 1: why have a publisher?

235
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,800
Speaker 1: then just pay an ad agency or pay Google Adsense?

236
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:30,175
Speaker 1: Or you know, you can just handle advertising on your own.

237
00:17:30,236 --> 00:17:30,880
Speaker 0: It's not our best.

238
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:36,295
Speaker 0: I could see a publishing company offering a suite of Advertising editing and consulting all in right.

239
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,925
Speaker 1: so Amazon I think I read.

240
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:40,822
Speaker 1: you know that the split on the Kindle books is 70 30.

241
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:41,614
Speaker 1: So Amazon gets.

242
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,286
Speaker 1: you know If it's $10 book Amazon gets three dollars.

243
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,131
Speaker 1: book publisher gets seven.

244
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:49,160
Speaker 1: author probably gets like a dollar if not less.

245
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:53,472
Speaker 1: Who knows what the author gets Depends on I guess the author's contract to with the publisher.

246
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:58,050
Speaker 1: if you are just an author You just go directly to Amazon with a $10 book.

247
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,922
Speaker 1: You're gonna get seven dollars per book Right.

248
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:07,356
Speaker 1: So, you know you tell me what's better on both ends, you know is the lower book price.

249
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:10,760
Speaker 1: book publisher goes out of business Author goes directly to Amazon.

250
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:11,978
Speaker 1: That's what we need.

251
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:14,248
Speaker 1: And in fact who even needs that right?

252
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:18,147
Speaker 1: author sets up a website where you can just download Their e-book.

253
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,820
Speaker 1: you pay them with PayPal or something.

254
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:29,125
Speaker 1: So PayPal gets a tiny tiny fee for the PayPal fee and the author gets close to ten dollars on the sale of their e-book Directly to you on the author's website.

255
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:30,349
Speaker 1: who even needs Amazon?

256
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,420
Speaker 1: right all Amazon provides is you know this technological?

257
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,610
Speaker 1: Expertise of creating an e-commerce store.

258
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,860
Speaker 1: Well Amazon creating an e-book reading device.

259
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:51,620
Speaker 0: What I would say is Amazon is one of the last middlemen that will exist at least in this era of the internet And it serves the same purpose that like a dig or a 4chan or a slashdot or anything served just in a different realm.

260
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:52,659
Speaker 0: And what does slashdot do?

261
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,980
Speaker 0: It's like a city on the internet where you have a whole bunch of people who want something.

262
00:18:57,342 --> 00:19:00,440
Speaker 0: So it provides the infrastructure within which all those people do all their business.

263
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,958
Speaker 0: Amazon basically provides that for e-commerce for a lot of people.

264
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:04,521
Speaker 0: now I think

265
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:26,547
Speaker 1: basically the only reason that middlemen can exist in the technological times that we have now is because of the vast technological Incompetence of many people and also, you know so they can't provide the technological part themselves because they don't know how right and be for Aggregation and sifting purposes based on the user like Google search.

266
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:33,044
Speaker 1: other than that like Over time anyone whose business is a middleman business It's just gonna go away.

267
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:36,316
Speaker 1: all middlemen are gonna be eliminated in the long run like 20 30 years.

268
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,892
Speaker 1: There just won't be any room for anyone who's a middleman every any.

269
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:49,840
Speaker 1: if you're not actually providing a service Directly as in you are, you know, either the consumer or the producer You're just not gonna be around, you know.

270
00:19:49,940 --> 00:20:03,380
Speaker 1: I would if you're if you're looking at a long bet in the stock market any middleman business, you know Especially like, you know a middleman like digital goods business like a like a music record company or a book publisher.

271
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,244
Speaker 1: I would if you could do like a long a sell-long if such a thing as possible Right.

272
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:10,151
Speaker 1: That's what I would do.

273
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:11,199
Speaker 0: You mean a buy?

274
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,766
Speaker 1: No, that's that's that's a buy.

275
00:20:14,107 --> 00:20:15,834
Speaker 0: so you could buy their competitors.

276
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:17,922
Speaker 1: I Guess you could.

277
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:19,088
Speaker 1: yes, you could but the all the.

278
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:23,369
Speaker 1: but the thing is if it's all whole bunch of middlemen verse each other They're all going down the tubes in the long run.

279
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,480
Speaker 0: So will you buy the people that replace the middlemen?

280
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:27,910
Speaker 0: So in this case, I don't know Amazon authors.

281
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,100
Speaker 1: Can I buy some Stephen King stock, huh?

282
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:40,260
Speaker 1: That maybe that's a way to kind of because I mean it's you know If the publishers all go out Stephen King is gonna make way more bank when he just sells his books directly to the customers.

283
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:42,532
Speaker 1: Well, you know and all the money is gonna go to him.

284
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,140
Speaker 0: unknown worlds kind of prove that this works.

285
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,179
Speaker 0: What if you set up a system and going forward where?

286
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:55,640
Speaker 0: Authors who who are established at least or even new authors if they want to make a book and they need money They basically form a company or a pseudo company.

287
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,660
Speaker 0: We make a new instrument for the purpose of the creation of a work of art or even the creation of something else.

288
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:05,207
Speaker 0: It's kind of like a new thing Like a new kind of corporation.

289
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:18,370
Speaker 0: when you make it you sell you have an IPO and you sell shares of that thing And then basically people buy that and the money goes a hundred percent to the author and then based on the shares The author pays back out to these investors.

290
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,118
Speaker 0: depending on however, they want to make their money.

291
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:21,725
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

292
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:24,616
Speaker 0: Maybe they pay out in non-monetary terms either.

293
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:25,620
Speaker 0: you can make some really cool things.

294
00:21:26,223 --> 00:21:27,047
Speaker 0: We can make it ourselves.

295
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:29,057
Speaker 0: if we wanted to let's put it in the hopper way at the bottom.

296
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:38,129
Speaker 0: Yeah But there's another interesting aside on this because our friend Murdoch came out and said Quote, we don't like Amazon.

297
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:41,444
Speaker 0: We don't like the Amazon model of selling everything at $9.99.

298
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:44,400
Speaker 0: They pay us wholesale price of $14 or whatever we charge.

299
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:50,320
Speaker 0: But I think it really devalues books and it hurts all the retailers of the hardcover books.

300
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:54,054
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to say that the retailers of hardcover books are morons.

301
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:55,580
Speaker 1: right and my evidence is steam.

302
00:21:55,942 --> 00:21:56,987
Speaker 1: Right, what does steam do?

303
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:59,640
Speaker 1: they take all these games that no one is buying?

304
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,144
Speaker 1: Right and they the price.

305
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:04,780
Speaker 1: the people are trying to sell these games for 40 bucks and X people are buying them.

306
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,423
Speaker 1: So what do they do?

307
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:09,460
Speaker 1: They cut the price to 20 maybe even 10 maybe even five dollars, right?

308
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:16,282
Speaker 1: So five dollars that's I guess the eight times less the price than $40.

309
00:22:16,282 --> 00:22:19,110
Speaker 1: But guess what the percentage of sales that goes up.

310
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:21,076
Speaker 1: It's way more than 800% more sales.

311
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,467
Speaker 1: It's like 2,000 percent more sales.

312
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:28,180
Speaker 1: So by lowering the price they make more sales and more money.

313
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,330
Speaker 1: You know what if you've dropped the price?

314
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:30,973
Speaker 1: or I think about this.

315
00:22:30,993 --> 00:22:32,360
Speaker 1: someone buys a Kindle, right?

316
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:35,296
Speaker 1: Maybe they buy a book they read it they buy another book.

317
00:22:35,457 --> 00:22:36,703
Speaker 1: They read it They buy another book.

318
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:37,185
Speaker 1: right?

319
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:43,490
Speaker 1: if Kindle books were 50 cents or a dollar People who bought Kindles would just buy every book.

320
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,035
Speaker 1: They'd be like, here's 50 bucks.

321
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:47,485
Speaker 1: Give me fucking 50 books Holy shit, you know.

322
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:48,671
Speaker 1: and they wouldn't even read half of them.

323
00:22:48,711 --> 00:22:50,560
Speaker 1: just buy a ton of them cuz they're so far even better.

324
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:54,096
Speaker 1: How many games do I buy on Steam that I never play and suck but they're $2.

325
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:55,000
Speaker 1: so I'm like whatever.

326
00:22:56,726 --> 00:23:03,100
Speaker 0: Even better for them the fact that with DRM and the loss of first sale I'll make more money because people won't be lending their books to each other.

327
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:04,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like why.

328
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:09,520
Speaker 1: you know, I could lend you this book and I you know And I might be pissed that I can't lend you this DRM book.

329
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,330
Speaker 1: But you know what if it's 50 cents?

330
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:13,120
Speaker 1: who gives a shit if I can't lend it to you?

331
00:23:13,161 --> 00:23:16,520
Speaker 1: You can get it You know, I don't you know this DRM on Netflix streaming.

332
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:18,648
Speaker 1: But who cares if I can't lend it to you?

333
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:19,752
Speaker 1: right and it's streaming.

334
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:21,800
Speaker 1: you can just get the same thing for so cheap.

335
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,086
Speaker 1: That is you know, what do I need to lend for?

336
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:29,720
Speaker 1: but caring about lending goes away if the price goes way down.

337
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,081
Speaker 0: Let's look at the model of hardcover books even directly like Murdoch was talking about hardcover books now Really?

338
00:23:35,523 --> 00:23:38,412
Speaker 0: They exist to squeeze more profit out of a book.

339
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:41,080
Speaker 0: They're like the DVD that goes on an artificial thing.

340
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:48,808
Speaker 0: They go, you know Because basically what they do now is it in a long time ago at least in some markets the paperback would come out Yeah, and then the hardcover be like.

341
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:51,280
Speaker 0: if you really like this book by the hardcover it lasts forever.

342
00:23:51,551 --> 00:24:03,159
Speaker 0: Yeah but at least right now a Hardcover comes out first and they sell that to the people who can't wait for the paperback and it just cost more and they make more money off of it and then they release the paperback as far later as they can.

343
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,064
Speaker 0: and P I don't know.

344
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:09,619
Speaker 0: for people like me other than our Scott backer books There's nothing worth the hardcover to me anymore.

345
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:10,182
Speaker 0: It's not.

346
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:27,006
Speaker 1: the only time I get a hardcover is if a book is like a only hardcover Be some sort of fancy giant coffee table type of book, you know Like I bought that like deluxe rocketeer something something or like the the art of Tezuka, you know Those are the kind of books that are hardcover.

347
00:24:27,347 --> 00:24:31,320
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I absolutely 100% avoid hardcover at all costs.

348
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:34,860
Speaker 1: But we're seeing more and more space and cost more money for the same thing.

349
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:55,180
Speaker 0: We're seeing more and more problems like this where a revenue stream was faltering and they someone some industry is made up for it By shifting sales by doing the hardcover trick or like now with the Netflix deal where they won't have new movies from certain studios For 28 days after the DVD comes out because DVD sales for anyone doesn't realize have been collapsing and not due to piracy.

350
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:59,040
Speaker 0: It's due to the fact that people just rent stuff because they no one wants to buy DVDs anymore.

351
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,480
Speaker 1: It just takes up room and you have Netflix streaming and Hulu.

352
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,063
Speaker 1: So who needs to?

353
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:04,816
Speaker 1: why should I buy a TV show box set on DVD?

354
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:12,560
Speaker 0: I can rent it I can Netflix stream it I can Hulu and so I haven't pirated anything in a long time and I don't need to and I get everything.

355
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:21,977
Speaker 0: I only pirated things that are unavailable that there is absolutely no way to get them Otherwise, but everyone's trying to protect these revenue streams in increasingly desperate ways and now we've got the.

356
00:25:22,077 --> 00:25:23,020
Speaker 1: it's not that they're trying.

357
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:27,984
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is is not that they're trying to protect the revenue stream, you know That's what they think they're doing.

358
00:25:28,044 --> 00:25:33,280
Speaker 1: right is that they're trying to protect the structure of the revenue stream, right?

359
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:40,280
Speaker 1: They could maintain the revenue stream by lowering the price to like two bucks and the revenue stream would probably increase and be very well.

360
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,489
Speaker 0: Well, you're forgetting there are a lot of it is in the way.

361
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:44,779
Speaker 1: They are very risk averse.

362
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:46,796
Speaker 0: now Scott You're forgetting there's a lot of players in the way.

363
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:49,132
Speaker 0: Rental DVDs at this point.

364
00:25:49,193 --> 00:25:50,380
Speaker 0: No one goes to Blockbuster anymore.

365
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,996
Speaker 0: The only people who rent that matter are those red boxes because they're easy and cheap.

366
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:56,648
Speaker 0: and Netflix Yep, so you go.

367
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,560
Speaker 0: basically we go studios Netflix consumers.

368
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:05,080
Speaker 0: And then the alternate hardcover book stream is you know studios?

369
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:11,620
Speaker 0: Retailers DVDs and all these like yeah, it's author publisher retailer then customer.

370
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,699
Speaker 0: But you're forgetting that the real men - even if the studios want to go direct the retailers don't want them to.

371
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:24,146
Speaker 0: I mean Look at all the crap that happened when steam first started coming up and all the video game retailers Like this is gonna destroy us.

372
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:27,140
Speaker 0: GameStop only exists because they're a pawn shop.

373
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:28,481
Speaker 1: Yeah Pretty much.

374
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:34,840
Speaker 1: a GameStop also only exists because punk kids who go to GameStop have cash and they don't have credit cards.

375
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,290
Speaker 1: So they can't buy an Amazon if you give credit cards.

376
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:41,460
Speaker 1: if we just got rid of cash and everyone had like a cash card.

377
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:48,000
Speaker 1: They just kept track of how much cash you had and you could use it everywhere for you know And the government just took care of it and all it was was cash.

378
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,680
Speaker 1: Basically You know GameStop would go out because all the kids would just have their allowance on a card and be able to buy online.

379
00:26:56,122 --> 00:27:00,317
Speaker 0: Yep, and there'd be marketplaces for used games and everything would be okay for kids to have it.

380
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:01,220
Speaker 1: cuz it's cash.

381
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:03,171
Speaker 1: It's not like a debit card with an account.

382
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:04,780
Speaker 1: It's not a loan like a credit card.

383
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,384
Speaker 1: It's just cash.

384
00:27:05,746 --> 00:27:08,180
Speaker 1: just happens to be on a card, you know, a little number shows.

385
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,566
Speaker 1: Maybe there'd be like LCD display.

386
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:13,711
Speaker 1: you push a button and it shows you how much money is on the card, you know Something like that.

387
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:24,400
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

388
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:28,397
Speaker 0: So Wilson Bentley is someone who was pretty cool.

389
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:39,920
Speaker 0: in 1885 he put together a rig and photographed a snowflake in Really really really exquisite detail with an old-ass camera that goes poof with the smoke and everything.

390
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,997
Speaker 0: This is back in a time when micro photography really didn't exist on this scale and he did it.

391
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:54,380
Speaker 0: and Then over the course of his life He did more than 5,000 individual snowflakes and these were actually a really important contribution to science to art to everything.

392
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,875
Speaker 0: He's a cool guy and these pictures even to this day are pretty freaking amazing.

393
00:27:57,895 --> 00:27:59,020
Speaker 1: They're all black and white though, right?

394
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:01,586
Speaker 0: Yes, they're black and white.

395
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:12,278
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's gotta have some color, you know, yeah I mean he was using like old bellows style cameras when he was a teenager doing this, you know It'd be cool if you can get one of those cameras and learn to use it and go poof.

396
00:28:13,122 --> 00:28:13,693
Speaker 1: That'd be cool.

397
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:18,580
Speaker 1: Like we take a camera like actually took a real picture of like the modern day with that old-ass camera.

398
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:23,355
Speaker 1: We could like take a picture of a digital camera with that camera.

399
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:28,195
Speaker 0: just wait a few years And that's what the hipsters will be doing because it's the only authentic way left to take a picture.

400
00:28:28,316 --> 00:28:33,413
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright, Wilson Bentley is pretty cool much like the guy with the balls from before.

401
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,239
Speaker 0: I put him on the same level as that guy.

402
00:28:36,243 --> 00:28:39,820
Speaker 1: So when I was in summer camp, we did some chemistry because it was nerd summer camp, right?

403
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:50,218
Speaker 1: And we would do things like throw sodium in the lake and such, you know Put the lid back on, you know, stuff like that.

404
00:28:50,962 --> 00:29:07,900
Speaker 1: But one thing they like to do the counselors is they took some sort of powder I forget what it was and then they would pour some sort of acid on it I think it might have been sulfuric acid and it was like the powder started out as one color and it was a tiny little Mountain of powder and it would start going poof poof poof poof poof and it would be like a volcano.

405
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:14,446
Speaker 1: and when it was done the powder all changed color and the mountain of powder was like Way bigger.

406
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,480
Speaker 1: like it expanded tremendously and I was pretty cool.

407
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:18,718
Speaker 0: I love stuff like that.

408
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:20,505
Speaker 1: So I couldn't.

409
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:25,280
Speaker 1: I still don't know exactly what that chemical reaction was, but I found a similar chemical reaction here.

410
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,108
Speaker 1: It's called the Pharaoh's snake.

411
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:35,202
Speaker 1: And what they do is they take mercury thios... ...ens... Something.

412
00:29:35,222 --> 00:29:39,640
Speaker 1: It's mercury something and basically what they do is they light it on fire.

413
00:29:40,382 --> 00:29:45,720
Speaker 1: And when they light it on fire a snake appears it decomposes and like expands tremendously.

414
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,772
Speaker 1: It makes these really cool crazy shapes and it makes a snake noise.

415
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:52,380
Speaker 1: and it's called the Pharaoh's snake and his YouTube video.

416
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:57,160
Speaker 0: It looks exactly like some horrifying Cthulhu monster rising about the earth to eat us all.

417
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:03,249
Speaker 1: Yeah The video is a little boring in the beginning because they spend all this time showing you the guy Sprinkling the powder into the tank.

418
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:05,559
Speaker 1: So just fast forward until he starts the fire.

419
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:07,447
Speaker 0: I kind of like the idea.

420
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:10,599
Speaker 0: imagine in ancient times if they'd figured out this reaction and could do it.

421
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:17,728
Speaker 0: You know Like the Roman army is marching on some Greek city-state and they just sprinkled this all over the field ahead of time And poisoned everybody.

422
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:19,440
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure this is really nasty and poisonous.

423
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:21,620
Speaker 0: It does not look like something you want to be inhaling.

424
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:23,980
Speaker 1: No, the guy's wearing gloves and they don't show his face.

425
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:30,368
Speaker 1: But I'm pretty sure he's got some sort of mask and they're doing it in a tank like, you know They're doing it in a diorama.

426
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:31,011
Speaker 0: That's true.

427
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:31,653
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

428
00:30:31,674 --> 00:30:33,160
Speaker 0: There's a little cacti in there and everything.

429
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:36,040
Speaker 1: Yeah I would have done it under like a fume hood and run the fuck away.

430
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:43,340
Speaker 0: The thing is the guy gets minus points for making this little like environment with the sand and the cacti But he doesn't have a tiny Pharaoh running away from it already.

431
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,492
Speaker 1: He also needs a tiny sky pirate skeleton with opening and closing treasure chest.

432
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:48,956
Speaker 0: Ah, there's no water.

433
00:30:49,678 --> 00:30:50,240
Speaker 1: That's the point.

434
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:54,197
Speaker 0: So, what do you got for me?

435
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:57,052
Speaker 1: What do you mean what I got for you thing of the day?

436
00:30:57,394 --> 00:30:58,279
Speaker 1: That was my thing of the day.

437
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,680
Speaker 0: Oh, didn't you have some news that you forgot in the beginning?

438
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,106
Speaker 1: The news that rim Reminded me of?

439
00:31:04,187 --> 00:31:10,500
Speaker 1: well in between the news and the thing of the day parts of the show I mean the thing that I was surprised you weren't doing is your news and was all over the news.

440
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:17,359
Speaker 0: So I assumed you would have found it if you were looking for it somehow was not on the news I mentioned off-handedly in the course of talking about an unrelated thing.

441
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:25,813
Speaker 1: So basically my news before I forgot it was going to be about Google store view which is not confirmed But it's looking pretty likely right.

442
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:29,599
Speaker 1: they caught someone Daysley doing this in a store in New York City.

443
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:37,720
Speaker 0: You realize all you would have to do is say you work for Google and you can probably get away with crazy stuff Photographing a store photographing the insides of people's houses.

444
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,636
Speaker 0: I'm sure you could go all out on a lot of people maybe but anyway, don't do that.

445
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:45,373
Speaker 1: It's probably illegal Yeah, but basically it's looking like it's very probable.

446
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:46,680
Speaker 1: Google's gonna do store view.

447
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:57,174
Speaker 1: So you have Street View But what you'll be able to do is basically go inside and look around the inside of a store From Google Maps, and I think that is super awesome.

448
00:31:57,194 --> 00:31:58,940
Speaker 1: because how many times like you see a restaurant?

449
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:02,238
Speaker 1: But then you're like, is it nice on the inside or is it a dump?

450
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:06,094
Speaker 1: and it's like Is it a sit-down restaurant or is it more of a takeout place?

451
00:32:06,395 --> 00:32:07,379
Speaker 1: and you can't really tell?

452
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:10,008
Speaker 1: Just by looking at it from the outside.

453
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,660
Speaker 1: You'd have to look on the inside or maybe they could even become more advanced.

454
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:17,340
Speaker 1: Maybe they can get to the point where it's like if they actually update this stuff often.

455
00:32:17,742 --> 00:32:20,240
Speaker 1: Maybe they could even update they have like restaurant menus.

456
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:23,107
Speaker 1: Maybe they could get like store inventories.

457
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:29,800
Speaker 1: So it's like you can go look inside a hardware store and See do they have X in stock?

458
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:37,568
Speaker 1: You can actually go down the aisles of like a Home Depot or you know be able to search like, okay Where is the nearest copy of X book?

459
00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:38,330
Speaker 1: and it can.

460
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:42,928
Speaker 1: you can go to a borders and it'll actually know if that borders has That book on the shelf.

461
00:32:42,948 --> 00:32:55,920
Speaker 1: because they took a picture of the shelf, you know This can go crazy far and I think it's gonna be pretty awesome And there's really no privacy concerns with it really other than they might catch so-and-so shopping at X store at X time.

462
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:57,426
Speaker 1: But they do that with Street View.

463
00:32:57,487 --> 00:32:58,511
Speaker 1: Anyways, there's no different.

464
00:32:58,571 --> 00:33:00,580
Speaker 0: Well, they blur out faces, which they'll probably do in this.

465
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:02,909
Speaker 0: I wish they didn't even blur out the spaces.

466
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,676
Speaker 0: I I'm more and more a few license plates.

467
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,486
Speaker 0: if you're in public That's it.

468
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:07,089
Speaker 0: You're in public.

469
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,337
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone takes a picture of you.

470
00:33:08,357 --> 00:33:08,780
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

471
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,515
Speaker 1: And I mean and you know, what's you know, they're not doing the people's houses.

472
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:12,460
Speaker 1: They're doing the stores.

473
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,770
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, what store wouldn't want to be on Google.

474
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:18,760
Speaker 1: You're basically hurting yourself by being off Google exactly more.

475
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,112
Speaker 0: I love this whole trend and only Google is doing it.

476
00:33:22,152 --> 00:33:26,064
Speaker 0: Well, I've just let's catalog a whole bunch of Interesting information.

477
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:32,060
Speaker 1: Let's give everyone equal and free advertising and then charge them for more prominence in said free equilibrium.

478
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:35,300
Speaker 1: It's like let's make a yellow, you know, it's the yellow pages model.

479
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,659
Speaker 1: Well, you know the yellow pages wants to have every frickin store in there.

480
00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:42,400
Speaker 1: But if you want to have the big square in the yellow pages got to pay more.

481
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:46,859
Speaker 1: But the thing is in order to make yellow pages you need to find out what all the stores are.

482
00:33:47,482 --> 00:33:55,672
Speaker 1: so Google's just going around getting everything they can about every store and then Charging the stores money if the stores want to have more prominent placement.

483
00:33:56,214 --> 00:34:01,440
Speaker 0: now, imagine the far future of this Integrated with like Google goggles or some sort of augmented reality.

484
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:11,603
Speaker 0: So you could see when one of your friends is near a store where you need something and you already know the thing you need Is in the store so you can just have it message them and say hey while you're out could you grab this for me?

485
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:13,027
Speaker 0: and then they pay?

486
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:21,639
Speaker 0: but it's through the Google system and you actually are the one who pays in The end and it even automatically pays them a small fee for getting it for you that you pre-negotiated.

487
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:28,400
Speaker 1: What could even be cooler right is like if you know, they have grub hubs that just sort of like, you know It.

488
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,110
Speaker 1: basically it's a go-between between you and restaurants.

489
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,255
Speaker 0: I want that for everything.

490
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:33,239
Speaker 1: No, but I mean like.

491
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:39,080
Speaker 1: You could like buy like I don't know frickin like just anything.

492
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:40,650
Speaker 0: Well, imagine here's what you would do.

493
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,819
Speaker 0: you have Amazon, right?

494
00:34:42,161 --> 00:35:02,580
Speaker 0: Imagine a distributed Amazon that uses this sort of technology to where when you want to buy something it shows you two options the closest physical store to you that has the item or the closest physical store to you that has the item at the cheapest price or The cheapest online store or the online store that has the quickest shipping and you pick one of those four.

495
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:03,860
Speaker 1: There's all sorts that you know.

496
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:10,060
Speaker 1: They basically give you every single possible balance between saving money and getting something quickly that you could possibly want.

497
00:35:10,261 --> 00:35:18,689
Speaker 0: You can even go one step further and have an automated system of people like Like whenever you want something that's in the store nearby It just puts out a call to anyone who has their.

498
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,200
Speaker 0: I am looking for delivery gigs app turned on.

499
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:32,997
Speaker 1: Maybe we could just get rid of stores entirely and they'll basically just be a local warehouse that has a whole bunch of stuff You know that is very commonly wanted and then they will employ many delivery people and that'll just be it.

500
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,040
Speaker 1: or even imagine this.

501
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:35,239
Speaker 0: All right You got the warehouse.

502
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:40,462
Speaker 0: Someone's walking by the warehouse or is bored and hanging out in the warehouse or is near the warehouse or whatever and I buy Something.

503
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:47,449
Speaker 0: a chain of events occurs to where it pings them saying hey you want to make a little bit of money Pick up this item and walk toward where you know.

504
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:55,940
Speaker 0: walk in this direction and then over the course of the way it looks for People who are already going toward where your delivery point is and pings all of them says hey pass it off to this guy.

505
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:56,755
Speaker 0: He's willing to take it.

506
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,505
Speaker 0: Microtransactions the whole way.

507
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:01,720
Speaker 0: and then some bum near your house grabs it drops it off on your front door.

508
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:04,712
Speaker 0: He gets five cents takes that, you know adds that to his total of.

509
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:06,560
Speaker 0: I can go buy some same pain eventually.

510
00:36:07,683 --> 00:36:17,480
Speaker 0: And it's like this complete distributed society to where all the menial work is done through Microtransactions immediately on demand as people need it when they need work, right?

511
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:25,380
Speaker 1: But then who's actually doing work that gets paid You know to earn money to actually buy things all the complicated work all the non-trivial work like, you know.

512
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:36,840
Speaker 1: But we do what everyone is either going to be doing real work being a delivery person of some sort or warehouse worker or Being a homeless bum, I think it would be more distributing.

513
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,140
Speaker 0: It would just basically be a universal gigging system of people doing things for money.

514
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:42,344
Speaker 0: It'd be a great way.

515
00:36:42,385 --> 00:36:45,758
Speaker 1: and you extrapolated this from taking pictures of the inside of a store for Street View.

516
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:49,640
Speaker 0: Yes Yes, okay, cuz I think they're in the exact same line of technology.

517
00:36:50,282 --> 00:36:51,307
Speaker 1: Alright, so we did it.

518
00:36:51,347 --> 00:36:53,495
Speaker 1: We did an extra news after the thing of the day.

519
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:54,580
Speaker 1: What are we doing for a show?

520
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:58,080
Speaker 0: Well last week we did the book club and we did not announce the new book.

521
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,447
Speaker 1: Well, shouldn't we do that on Thursday?

522
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:01,840
Speaker 1: considering, you know, I think we should visit Thursday thing.

523
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,894
Speaker 0: I feel like we should announce it tonight and then I also.

524
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:04,820
Speaker 1: I guess this is a meta moment.

525
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:06,044
Speaker 0: It is the meta moment.

526
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:08,713
Speaker 0: All right, so meta moment the book club.

527
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,679
Speaker 0: We're having a new book announcement right now.

528
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:11,359
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

529
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:26,807
Speaker 0: So we debated for like an hour after we did the last book club show on what book to do because I read a lot of nonfiction and a lot of like dopey fantasy and between the two I couldn't come up with any book that I Expected the listeners to actually

530
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:27,529
Speaker 1: read.

531
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:29,356
Speaker 0: and at the same time.

532
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:30,540
Speaker 0: I don't want to just pick a throwaway book.

533
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:36,820
Speaker 0: I want to pick something that like I want people to read these books for a reason and I wanted to do something short and fun like the little prince.

534
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:45,420
Speaker 0: But I'll let Scott pick that one because I know he will and if he doesn't I'll pick it next time eventually Independently and I just ordered a new copy cuz my copy from childhood is falling apart.

535
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,025
Speaker 0: It is Emily and I are.

536
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:53,428
Speaker 0: we are watching the old Carl Sagan Cosmo series from you know, 1980 on Netflix streaming Yes, yeah, which we just discussed.

537
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:55,820
Speaker 0: cuz I've only watched about I don't know half of it in my life.

538
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,991
Speaker 0: So I figure it's good time to catch up and like watch all the bits.

539
00:37:58,051 --> 00:37:59,679
Speaker 1: I miss I've only watched YouTube parts.

540
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:00,888
Speaker 0: It's great.

541
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:12,500
Speaker 0: It's amazing, but Carl Sagan for people don't understand especially I think people from Generations other than the generation that grew up in the 70s to become scientists.

542
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:24,059
Speaker 0: Carl Sagan influenced an entire generation of scientists to become scientists to be all inspired about space and science and exploration and And figuring out what it is that makes our world tick.

543
00:38:24,843 --> 00:38:26,632
Speaker 0: Carl Sagan is one of my personal heroes.

544
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,160
Speaker 0: He's one of the coolest guys to ever live.

545
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:29,826
Speaker 0: He kind of sounds like a Muppet.

546
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:33,599
Speaker 0: He looked he had a perpetual toupee, even though I'm pretty sure that was his real hair.

547
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:37,604
Speaker 0: yeah, and I just I love him and his book.

548
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:47,320
Speaker 0: cosmos is probably more instrumental to the rise of Scientific understanding among the masses and getting kids excited about science and going into scientific fields.

549
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:59,434
Speaker 0: Possibly the most influential book along those lines of any book in human history or at least in recent human history and I worry Sorry about that had a little technological flub there.

550
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:00,479
Speaker 0: I'm still new to audition.

551
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:11,573
Speaker 0: Carl Sagan's cosmos is an instrumental and important book and the greatest thing about it is that to this day Very few things in it proved to be inaccurate.

552
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:25,614
Speaker 0: the parts where it's speculated Panned out to be 99% true and the parts where it talked about existing science have almost entirely been not only non Disproven but more proven like proven to the degree to a startling degree.

553
00:39:25,955 --> 00:39:37,832
Speaker 0: The book is almost prescient and It inspired me to care about science in a big way as a kid and I feel like this should be required reading for every Single person in high school regard.

554
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:42,126
Speaker 0: This should just be a book that when you're in 11th grade You just have to read it Maybe even not as part of a class.

555
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:42,950
Speaker 0: you just have to read it.

556
00:39:43,352 --> 00:39:49,979
Speaker 1: because if you read this and by the end of this Book, I mean they can't even force kids to do summer reading How do you think you can force anyone to read anything gunpoint?

557
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:51,807
Speaker 0: It's weird.

558
00:39:51,867 --> 00:40:07,319
Speaker 0: I never did the summer reading But I do a whole bunch of unrelated reading because I wanted to and then I just make I'd flub stuff for the summer reading When I got back into school like the week before school I would go and like flip through all the books I had to read and write dodgy vague essays that got a is.

559
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,387
Speaker 0: anyway they didn't read that stuff, but Gunpoint I figure is the only way.

560
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:15,600
Speaker 0: okay, seriously Carl Sagan's read it to them.

561
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:17,064
Speaker 0: Well, you know what.

562
00:40:17,204 --> 00:40:26,626
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that at least a quarter of the listeners are gonna totally cop out and just watch the Carl Sagan cosmos Streaming series on Netflix.

563
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:31,784
Speaker 1: you need to do some sort of thing where we can like figure out how many people are actually reading The books.

564
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:34,014
Speaker 1: we need some sort of geek nights listener survey.

565
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:34,496
Speaker 1: Yeah.

566
00:40:34,636 --> 00:40:35,520
Speaker 0: Well, we'll figure that out.

567
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,699
Speaker 0: We'll announce that in more detail.

568
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,193
Speaker 0: But Carl Sagan's cosmos is one of the most inspiring books I've ever read.

569
00:40:41,213 --> 00:40:52,465
Speaker 0: if you can get through the series or the book Without feeling a sense of awe at how much and how little we simultaneously understand about the universe You are not a person and you don't deserve to be here.

570
00:40:58,776 --> 00:41:01,300
