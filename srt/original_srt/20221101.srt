1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,095
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, November 1st, 2022.

2
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:14,344
Speaker 1: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights.

3
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:17,230
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are reviewing Marvel Snap.

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,388
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:32,670
Speaker 0: So, Scott at the Scott household, you guys hosted a minor Friends Halloween gathering, and I gotta say, you're- We decided, well, we did it once before, and we're like, alright, let's just make that our thing, right, you know.

6
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:48,870
Speaker 0: I like that being your thing, diversify the things, but your costume was an appropriately funny one, and- Well, 'cause, you know, I had, you know, I'm not a person, you know, I appreciate a cosplay, right, but obviously, that's not my hobby, I don't got time for that, right?

7
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,070
Speaker 0: So, if I'm gonna wear a costume, I'm going to purchase it, right?

8
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,910
Speaker 1: Yep, you're not gonna go the level below to what I might have worn at RIT back in the day.

9
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:10,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, I had a Pusheen onesie, and I was like, oh, well, I have this, I might as well- I kept using it as a costume whenever I needed one, but the problem is, it was too small, mostly 'cause my arms are too long, right?

10
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,020
Speaker 1: Well, there's a secondary problem, 'cause I've used my equivalents.

11
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are way too warm for 90% of circumstances.

12
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:34,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, so anyway, I was using that, and I'm like, alright, that's enough of the Pusheen onesie, let's get something else, and I said, alright, if I'm gonna get something, it's either gonna be cheap and disposable, or it's gonna be reusable, like the Pusheen was, right?

13
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:45,121
Speaker 0: So, I was looking around, looking around, and I was like, oh, I could get this, you know, skeleton, basically spandex deal, right?

14
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:53,290
Speaker 0: It was pretty high quality, it wasn't cheap either, but I could just use that every year, and just get a different kind of skeleton, right?

15
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:03,083
Speaker 0: I would apply, on top of the expensive reusable skeleton costume, right, some skeleton flavor that is cheap and disposable, right?

16
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:08,630
Speaker 0: So I started with the very straightforward pirate skeleton, and it looked better than I thought it was gonna look.

17
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,655
Speaker 1: I think the fact that the jaw actually sort of moved separately from the rest of it.

18
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:35,210
Speaker 0: And it worked, I'm like, alright, got a skeleton, you know, so those two parts I can reuse, and now next year, you know, I'll be a different kind of skeleton, and I'll just keep being a different kind of skeleton forever.

19
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:47,390
Speaker 1: Yep, Emily and I went relatively low rent, I was gonna get it make a better, like more realistic Star Trek costume, but despite ordering a bunch of parts, like shirt, like things way in advance, none of them arrived by Halloween.

20
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,134
Speaker 1: So, I ended up wearing, basically, a Star Trek costume.

21
00:02:52,154 --> 00:03:11,170
Speaker 1: if you're going low rent is just a cheap shirt, so I had a cheap shirt, and it looked okay in photos, but in person, it was the same material that like, bottom of the barrel sportswear is made out of, like bad knit polyester, that is definitely the kind of fabric that will smell like a gym locker within two seconds of touching flesh.

22
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:24,010
Speaker 1: But, I will get a better one, I gotta say though, our friend Kat, he really knocked out of the park in terms of Star Trek, because not only was he wearing a real shirt, but he dressed up as Data's painting from the meme.

23
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:35,762
Speaker 0: Very, oh, one of those, I mean, I don't know what the meme is, but I guess that's one of those, like, one episode- How do you know, we've watched this in your presence, Data's painting is making me dizzy.

24
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,050
Speaker 1: I like being strong, that's where I like being strong comes from.

25
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:42,030
Speaker 0: I mean, I know the character Data is like the emotionless robot guy.

26
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:52,790
Speaker 1: Alright, so, all I'll say is there is a short, meme-y internet video where someone took an episode of Star Trek, which is a normal episode where Data starts painting, like he makes paintings.

27
00:03:53,251 --> 00:04:03,690
Speaker 1: And independently, Worf, the Klingon guy, is disturbed by and feels sick because of, among other things, Data's painting.

28
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:10,610
Speaker 1: And they cut this together, and they replace the paintings with terrifying furry fetish art.

29
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:11,939
Speaker 0: Alright.

30
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:21,269
Speaker 1: And it's, like, a minute long, and it's moderately funny, and that is why, in the private Discord, there is an emoji of a horse that is called Strong.

31
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:22,967
Speaker 1: And I'll leave it at that.

32
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,837
Speaker 0: Alright, but, you know, the point is, I love those, I like the one episode deals, right?

33
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:33,802
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, who wants to, you could be a Spider-Man costume, right?

34
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:47,810
Speaker 1: My favorite thing to do if I was going to dress up, like, at anime cons as an adult would be the minorest possible background character from something.

35
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, but definitely, but, like, distinctly, that, you know, you could be a Fish-Man from Slayers, right?

36
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:54,450
Speaker 0: It's like, you know.

37
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,473
Speaker 1: No, you know what it's like?

38
00:04:55,493 --> 00:05:00,010
Speaker 1: It's the difference between being Alan Chazar versus being Cliff Chazar.

39
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:10,450
Speaker 1: So, in the news, in a recent competitive professional game, you may have heard of this game, it's called NASCAR.

40
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:16,461
Speaker 0: Well, NASCAR is the league, the sport is stock car racing.

41
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:20,350
Speaker 0: Even though the cars they use are far from stock.

42
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:25,509
Speaker 1: So, did you know, total aside, it bothers me now that I realize this.

43
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:34,430
Speaker 1: A ball bearing refers to, ball bearing refers to the collection of ball bearings in the bearing, and also to the individual balls in the ball bearing.

44
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,410
Speaker 1: They are both called ball bearings.

45
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:43,988
Speaker 1: Pedants are trying to call the balls inside bearing balls, which would make sense, but literally no one does that.

46
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:44,930
Speaker 1: It's all ball bearings.

47
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,854
Speaker 1: It's all NASCAR, it's all Legos.

48
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:52,649
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm just going to read the headline, then we'll talk about the news, because this headline on Kotaku tells you everything you need to know.

49
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:58,489
Speaker 1: Quote, "Nascar driver pulls some video game shit, thanks GameCube, an interview

50
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,850
Speaker 1: afterward.".

51
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:01,856
Speaker 0: Right, so here's the actual story, right?

52
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:06,410
Speaker 0: So, they're racing, it's the second to last race of NASCAR for this year, right?

53
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:14,330
Speaker 0: So, the way NASCAR works now, I don't know all the rules of it, because I haven't paid attention to it in decades, since like the last millennia, right?

54
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:16,050
Speaker 1: High school was the last time I paid attention.

55
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:21,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, way back in the day, the way it worked is you would just get points, like any other, like F1, right?

56
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,210
Speaker 0: And whoever had the most points at the end of the season was the champion, right?

57
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:33,468
Speaker 0: Now, there's actually some sort of tournament structures, where like at the final race, there's only four people who actually have like a chance to win, right?

58
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:34,130
Speaker 0: They're in the showdown.

59
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:43,229
Speaker 0: So, this guy, who was racing, he was coming, it was one of those tracks that's really short with high banks, almost like a velodrome for cars, right?

60
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,830
Speaker 0: And those are a lot of fun, even though you're basically, like you talk about NASCAR, they're just going around in circles.

61
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,549
Speaker 1: On this track, they're just going around in circles.

62
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,457
Speaker 0: They are really just going around in circles, right?

63
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:55,921
Speaker 0: Like really, it's so short.

64
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:59,670
Speaker 0: Anyway, but there's some fun aspects to that, right?

65
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:13,310
Speaker 0: There's a lot of, the cars are all bunched up all the time, you know, you're not like, if you go to watch one of those races, you can see all the cars at once going around in this, you know, as opposed to like you go to some other big track, and it's like a car will come, and then you sit and wait, and then some cars come, right?

66
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:31,366
Speaker 1: And also, while the sport zoomed out, looks like just a mess of cars kind of going in a circle, and I'm not a fan of NASCAR, NASCAR Super, really, but zoom in and like watch a dash cam for one car, and there's a lot of micro-aggression nonsense, like fighting and bumping and jockeying for position.

67
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:33,250
Speaker 1: There's a lot of skill involved in NASCAR.

68
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,449
Speaker 0: There's a lot worse sports, but it's not the best.

69
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,091
Speaker 1: Right.

70
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:41,719
Speaker 0: So anyway, so this guy's in 10th place on the second to last lap.

71
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:51,256
Speaker 0: In order for him to qualify to be one of the four people who could win the championship at the next race, he's got to do better than 10th place, right?

72
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:52,458
Speaker 0: 10th isn't going to be good enough.

73
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,470
Speaker 0: So what reason is there for this guy to not just put it all on the line?

74
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,757
Speaker 0: If worst case, he crashes, as long as he doesn't die, right?

75
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:05,408
Speaker 0: If he ruins the car, if he comes in last place, what does it matter, right?

76
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:06,530
Speaker 0: That doesn't matter.

77
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,710
Speaker 0: As long as he doesn't die.

78
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:08,851
Speaker 0: Right.

79
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:13,570
Speaker 0: As long as he doesn't die or hurt anyone else, it literally doesn't matter, right?

80
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:29,856
Speaker 0: So the typical driving pattern on these bold tracks, right, is to take the outside of the track, right, close to the wall when you're on the straightaway, which is very brief on this tiny track, and then dip in, you know, cause it's banked, right?

81
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:39,390
Speaker 0: So you go down low, right, to the low part of the track to go around the corner and then go back up to the, you know, go back up the wall again and basically bank up and down and up and down and so right.

82
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,095
Speaker 0: And that's basically over the long run.

83
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:50,630
Speaker 0: That's the fastest way to go around the track because, you know, it's like, yeah, you have to lower your speed to get down into the banks, but you're taking the shortest path, right?

84
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:57,290
Speaker 0: If you just tried to go around the outside of the track the whole time, you're taking such a long path compared to everyone else.

85
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're literally driving further in a race, like doing extra laps, like the penalty laps in a biathlon.

86
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:03,751
Speaker 0: Exactly.

87
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:05,115
Speaker 0: It's not a good idea, right?

88
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:06,358
Speaker 0: But what does this guy do?

89
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:11,110
Speaker 0: Well, according to him, there's a trick he learned on GameCube NASCAR.

90
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,972
Speaker 1: I'm gonna quote him from the interview.

91
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:18,119
Speaker 1: "I played a lot of NASCAR 2005 on the GameCube, which I had growing up.

92
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,785
Speaker 1: You could get away with it in the game, and I never knew if it would actually work.

93
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,309
Speaker 1: I mean, I did that when I was eight years

94
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:25,589
Speaker 1: old.".

95
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,657
Speaker 0: Yep, so when he was eight years old when we were in college, a young dude, right?

96
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:35,410
Speaker 0: He basically, on the last lap, he floors it, obviously, that's clear strategy.

97
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, take the most aggressive, most dangerous line, just go nuts.

98
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:46,383
Speaker 0: Right, but if you're flooring it on a track like this, right, you can't get down into the bottom of the turn, right?

99
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:50,530
Speaker 0: You know, because of the, you know, whatever it's called.

100
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,579
Speaker 1: You're gonna be understeering.

101
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,610
Speaker 1: You won't be able to just turn in without spinning out.

102
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,831
Speaker 0: Exactly.

103
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:02,740
Speaker 0: So, rather than go down, which he can't do anyway, because this car's there in the way, right?

104
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,688
Speaker 0: When you're going around the turn, there's no cars up at the top, because who's going up there?

105
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:08,610
Speaker 0: Nobody, right?

106
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,852
Speaker 1: But he guns it on the last lap.

107
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:11,994
Speaker 1: He kind of bumps out of the way.

108
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:13,457
Speaker 0: A little bit, yeah.

109
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,421
Speaker 0: But he guns it on the last lap.

110
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:20,350
Speaker 0: He takes the high road up by the wall around the whole turn.

111
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,194
Speaker 0: So, he's going on a longer course around, right?

112
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:33,370
Speaker 0: He's covering more total ground, but he's going so much faster by not hitting the brakes to go into the turn, and he's tearing up the side of his car, right, on the wall.

113
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, he has rammed the wall, and he's just riding it.

114
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:39,710
Speaker 1: He said in the interview, he kind of just let go of the wheel, and held the accelerator down.

115
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,498
Speaker 0: Right, it's like he's destroying his car.

116
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,810
Speaker 0: You can't do this every lap, otherwise your car would disappear, right?

117
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,330
Speaker 1: Car looks like it's starting to struggle just as it gets over the finish line, too.

118
00:10:50,390 --> 00:11:00,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, Porsche, the person who is named Porsche, I don't know his first name, right, who the car is named after, said, like, the ideal race car should cross the finish line and then fall apart, right?

119
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,690
Speaker 1: Blues Brothers car style.

120
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,012
Speaker 0: Exactly.

121
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:05,637
Speaker 0: So, this dude, he does exactly that.

122
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:11,310
Speaker 0: On the last lap, not even on both turns, only on the last turn, the last two turns technically, right?

123
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:22,850
Speaker 0: But, of the last lap, he guns it, he grinds the car against the wall, he's going, even though he's going further distance-wise, his speed is so much faster than the cars that are braking.

124
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:28,328
Speaker 1: He passes, like, one, two, three, four, five, six, he passes so many people in that seven seconds.

125
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:40,190
Speaker 0: He goes from tenth to fifth place on the final lap, which is, by the way, enough to get him in to possibly win the championship next race.

126
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:47,970
Speaker 0: Also, he eliminated someone, someone who was in, who could have won the championship next race, is now eliminated from championship convention.

127
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,310
Speaker 1: Even better, he had the best lap time for the final lap because of that.

128
00:11:52,890 --> 00:12:01,049
Speaker 0: No, no, no, he had the best lap time ever on this track by a tenth of a second, period.

129
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,590
Speaker 0: Ever.

130
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:06,847
Speaker 1: Oh, my article didn't say that, it just said he beat the best final lap time by 2.5 seconds.

131
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:08,712
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

132
00:12:08,872 --> 00:12:10,955
Speaker 0: By, well, final lap time by 2.5.

133
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:19,690
Speaker 0: He had the track record for fastest lap in qualifying in a race ever, at least for this kind of car, right?

134
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,153
Speaker 0: By a tenth of a second.

135
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:28,670
Speaker 0: So, like, someone who was trying to qualify and get pole position and got pole position on an empty track on this, in this, right?

136
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:34,043
Speaker 0: This guy on the final lap was faster than that by a tenth of a second.

137
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:36,630
Speaker 0: The fastest ever, right?

138
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:44,810
Speaker 1: It is amazing that no one tried this before, but maybe it's not that amazing because the dude literally got the idea from the Game of Cube.

139
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, but, you know, it's like a player of games, perfect, right?

140
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:58,230
Speaker 0: But, now that people have seen this, right, is everyone, obviously not on the pre-final lap because you ruined your car, right?

141
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:07,770
Speaker 0: I mean, you'll be out of the race, but why wouldn't everyone, no, you'd ruin your car, but on the final lap of the race, isn't everyone going to do this?

142
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:29,833
Speaker 1: So then, it will become, just like when you, me, and our friends pay El Grande, where everyone's trying to position themselves for the exact same endgame, the 2.1.13, but everyone knows everyone's trying to do it, so the arts can be- You won't pass anybody, right?

143
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:31,717
Speaker 0: And it'll be really interesting.

144
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:34,863
Speaker 0: So, I also wonder, and also it's track-specific.

145
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:36,747
Speaker 0: I mean, there are other short tracks, like.

146
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:38,390
Speaker 0: I think Bristol is another one.

147
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:44,890
Speaker 1: Well, it's track-specific the same way that in Initial D, Takumi's Hug the Gutter is track-specific.

148
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:45,992
Speaker 0: Exactly.

149
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:51,970
Speaker 0: There might, though, be other tracks where, you know, even though they're not these sort of, you know, bowl tracks, right?

150
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,250
Speaker 1: But there might be other types of strategies like this that everyone's avoided.

151
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,687
Speaker 0: Have a final, like a turn on the final lap where, like, you know, it's just like, "Fuck

152
00:13:59,748 --> 00:13:59,808
Speaker 0: it.".

153
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,194
Speaker 1: There might be other types of strategies.

154
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:07,164
Speaker 1: There might be a chicane where you could, like, bounce your rear end off of the second half of it to spin around.

155
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:17,110
Speaker 0: Like, there's lots of crap people could start trying now that no one's- I mean, in other sports, we've already seen just so many years of, you know, development and destruction of orthodoxy.

156
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:20,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, nobody's made a new football play in a while.

157
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:25,562
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, like, you know, basketball, we've seen people finally just embrace the three-pointer.

158
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:28,610
Speaker 0: It took them a long time to finally just go for that, right?

159
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,949
Speaker 0: You know, a few decades that they had the three-pointer before they said, "Oh, that's that three points is better than

160
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:33,089
Speaker 0: two.".

161
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:36,470
Speaker 0: I mean, baseball- Why didn't you do that in the 80s or 90s when they added the three-pointer?

162
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,958
Speaker 1: Baseball had a million clever trick plays that were all eventually destroyed by the true outcomes.

163
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:47,890
Speaker 1: Like, every sport, every major sport, and most car racing has hit sort of these terminal strategies for their current rule sets.

164
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,467
Speaker 1: And out of nowhere, this dude is like, "Well, there's a new

165
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:50,729
Speaker 1: meta.".

166
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,684
Speaker 0: The ABA added the three-pointer in '61.

167
00:14:55,884 --> 00:15:05,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, the NBA added the three-pointer in 1979, and it wasn't until, like, the 2000s that people were doing, you know, like, really focusing on it, right?

168
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:05,960
Speaker 0: A whole lot.

169
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:26,178
Speaker 1: So, in some other news, you may remember that Embracer, the company that is embracing basically the entire nerd media world bit by bit, conglomerating all together, that they had bought Square Enix Montreal, which rebranded itself.

170
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,860
Speaker 1: That was the news from October.

171
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:40,280
Speaker 1: So, not that long ago, the news from October 10th was Square Enix Montreal, having been bought by Embracer, rebranded itself as Onoma to continue making games with a new brand, and they ta-.

172
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,893
Speaker 1: There's this article I'm gonna link to where they talked about, "We're making sequels, remakes, and remasters.

173
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:48,720
Speaker 1: We're gonna go after Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and a few other

174
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,920
Speaker 1: things.".

175
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:51,526
Speaker 1: It is now November 1st.

176
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:54,773
Speaker 1: It is a few weeks after that announcement.

177
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,620
Speaker 1: Embracer is shutting down that studio entirely.

178
00:15:58,803 --> 00:15:59,918
Speaker 0: Alright, well, they embraced it.

179
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:19,280
Speaker 1: I, my cynical guess, I don't have any information, this is a pure opinion-based guess, just to clarify that, is that Embracer really, really convinced the people at this studio to rebrand so that the news wouldn't be Square Enix shuts down in Montreal.

180
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:26,720
Speaker 1: The news was Onoma, something no one's heard about, shut down, and everyone kind of forgets what happened.

181
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,880
Speaker 0: I don't think it's that, because it's like, you know, if it's no longer owned, if I were to buy Square Enix, I don't know, New York, right?

182
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:43,480
Speaker 0: And Square Enix officially, the company in Japan, still exists, I'm sort of required to change the name to avoid trademark infringement, right?

183
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,510
Speaker 0: Regardless of whether I'm gonna shut it down or not.

184
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,320
Speaker 0: I can't keep calling it that.

185
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,960
Speaker 1: Depending on the terms of the deal, of course.

186
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:57,680
Speaker 0: Right, like if you bought Nintendo of America for some reason, you wanted to own a marketing customer service company, right?

187
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,800
Speaker 0: Even though Nintendo of Japan still existed, you couldn't keep calling it Nintendo of America.

188
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:14,540
Speaker 1: So case in point, a long time ago, I worked for a company called Pipeline Financial, and they, when they were shutting down, renamed themselves for a bunch of reasons to sort of just disappear into obscurity.

189
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,903
Speaker 1: Like, that happens all the time.

190
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:25,079
Speaker 1: They didn't just rename it, they did a big rebranding, announced projects, and like, made a big deal about like, this is what we're gonna do under this new brand.

191
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:34,260
Speaker 1: But I'm pretty, my guess would be that that was all just Embracer trying to keep them from imploding until they actually shut them down, and the plan was to shut them down all along.

192
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:50,619
Speaker 1: You may remember that Embracer, not that long ago, also bought Asmode and Dark Horse, and they are one more of the hyper-capitalist conglomerate threats to all entertainment media.

193
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:51,660
Speaker 1: I don't know what to do about this.

194
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,319
Speaker 1: It's not like our government's gonna do any antitrust anytime soon.

195
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,499
Speaker 0: Well, it's a Swedish company, but Sweden's going in the wrong direction right now, so...

196
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,760
Speaker 1: Yup, fascism's on the rise all over the world.

197
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:19,740
Speaker 0: Alright, so, in another news, right, we all know here on Geek Nights, we all know about Dwarf Fortress, right, we interviewed, one of the few people who has been interviewed on our podcast is Tarn Adams, the creator of Dwarf Fortress, back in the year 2006.

198
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,759
Speaker 0: That was a long time ago.

199
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:34,096
Speaker 0: Ancient times, right, and Dwarf Fortress is infamous, but it's managed to keep existing for like, you know, about as long as Geek Nights has existed, Dwarf Fortress has also existed, and it's vastly more successful.

200
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:36,920
Speaker 0: Their Patreon brings in like 10k a month, right, they don't gotta work.

201
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:53,800
Speaker 0: But anyway, so Dwarf Fortress is out there, and some while ago, right, maybe last year, year before, I forget exactly when, they teamed up with this other game studio, something Fox, something Games, I forget what it's called.

202
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,040
Speaker 0: It's Fox something, right?

203
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,558
Speaker 1: Ah, Kit Fox.

204
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,299
Speaker 0: Kit Fox, that's the one.

205
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:06,760
Speaker 0: And basically, they're like, alright, we're gonna keep making the Dwarf Fortress, but Kit Fox, you know, we actually want to try to make some money now, not just keep giving Dwarf Fortress away for free.

206
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,419
Speaker 0: You know, I guess they realized they wanted health insurance, right, in the United States, where they live.

207
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:38,940
Speaker 0: And they're like, okay, we'll make a version of Dwarf Fortress that's sort of like the premium edition, but not ASCII graphics, you know, actual graphics, you know, some other fanciness, and we'll put it out on Steam and itch, and sell it for not free, and we'll keep the original ASCII Dwarf Fortress free, and that's what the state of things will be for as long as they live and keep making this game, right.

208
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:45,380
Speaker 0: But I'm sure, even if they were to not live, someone else would carry this game, right, forward, somewhere, somehow.

209
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:46,079
Speaker 0: I may.

210
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,360
Speaker 0: Anyway.

211
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,620
Speaker 1: I'm debating making one final attempt at playing Dwarf Fortress.

212
00:19:50,500 --> 00:20:03,100
Speaker 0: So, I'm like, alright, you know, it's like, first of all, it's been so long since I played a Dwarf Fortress, it's still Dwarf Fortress, but there had to have been so many improvements since then, and so many changes, and I've forgotten so much.

213
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:09,219
Speaker 0: It would be like a whole new thing, and even though the quality of life is gonna be awful, it's gonna still be better than it was.

214
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:09,980
Speaker 1: Yup.

215
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:19,420
Speaker 1: 'Cause what it was, I enjoyed talking to all of you when you were trying to play it, but I bounced off hard, despite loving everything that it was, it was just not a game I could play.

216
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:25,280
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people, there are a lot of people who are like super into Dwarf Fortress, that's their number one thing, and they never play it.

217
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,120
Speaker 0: All they do is watch other people play it, or, you know, hang out in the communities and never actually play it themselves ever again.

218
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:41,080
Speaker 1: I mean, and our panel at PEX West, me and Emily, we talked about Boat Murdered, like the famous, the first big, widely known Dwarf Fortress playthrough epic story that someone told.

219
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:56,280
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, this has been, there's been a Steam page for this upgraded Dwarf Fortress, Steam edition, real money edition, it's also an itch.io, for a long time now, it's been on my wishlist.

220
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:14,540
Speaker 0: They announced today, literally today, right, which I didn't think this would ever happen, they put up a YouTube, like, announced date trailer, yes, it's actually going to be released on December 6th this year, so in a month and five days, it's actually coming out.

221
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,596
Speaker 0: It's not like, I thought it was gonna be years more before it came out, nope, it's December 6th, 2022, it's set in stone, it's coming out.

222
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:23,978
Speaker 1: Set in stone.

223
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:26,140
Speaker 0: That's right, that's right.

224
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:29,078
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'm gonna play it.

225
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:31,458
Speaker 0: I'm gonna buy it for sure.

226
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,598
Speaker 0: You know what, I will.

227
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,240
Speaker 0: And I'm gonna follow my policy of buy and immediately play, and I'm also gonna buy an itch.io.

228
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:44,339
Speaker 1: I will do the same, and I will play it until I can't anymore, or do not want to anymore, but I will try.

229
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:52,200
Speaker 0: Well, get some instructions, if you just try to play it straight up, it's not a good faith effort, you gotta get some instructions.

230
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I know, I wonder if that, I gotta find, do I have a bookmark for that site I used that was like the...

231
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,257
Speaker 0: Well, I actually have a printed, physical, hard, you know, not a hardcover, but a book that was like a Dwarf Fortress book from back in the day.

232
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:06,680
Speaker 0: that was, I think, O'Reilly published.

233
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,760
Speaker 0: But I doubt it's still correct, because it hasn't been updated in maybe a decade.

234
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,440
Speaker 1: I'll definitely do the thing I did for, like, Hearts of Iron.

235
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,640
Speaker 0: But I'm sure that there's a wiki with a tutorial that has everything.

236
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,500
Speaker 1: Do the thing like Hearts of Iron, where you play, do one playthrough following a very scripted tutorial, that is how I learned to play Offworld Trading Company.

237
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:30,140
Speaker 0: If, right, if the listener knows the best Dwarf Fortress tutorial, there's probably a YouTube one, too, that you can follow, right?

238
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:30,431
Speaker 0: Yeah.

239
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,718
Speaker 0: In this day and age, so...

240
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,820
Speaker 1: Oh, we should play Offworld Trading Company again, too, I've forgotten everything about it, so it'd be great to play again.

241
00:22:38,302 --> 00:22:40,820
Speaker 0: I haven't forgotten, except what goes on in the playthrough.

242
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:45,377
Speaker 1: I don't remember my strats, despite the fact that I seem to have, like, a 90% win rate.

243
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,100
Speaker 0: Your strap was just do what the spreadsheet said.

244
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:49,719
Speaker 0: The spreadsheet's real good!

245
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:56,200
Speaker 1: The thing is, every time I tried to do the slightly more advanced variants in the spreadsheet, I would crater.

246
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,391
Speaker 0: Yep.

247
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:08,420
Speaker 1: So one last little news, I don't have a lot to say about this yet, because I am reporting on this, because I did not know this was a thing game companies could do in Steam.

248
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,815
Speaker 1: And when I pointed out to Scott, Scott also was unaware.

249
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:12,880
Speaker 1: this was a possibility.

250
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:18,860
Speaker 1: So if you don't know, in Steam, there is a feature that if you're not using it, you really should.

251
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,660
Speaker 1: You can basically share games that you have bought with your household or with your family.

252
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,220
Speaker 0: Without any security issues.

253
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, you'll have separate cloud saves and everything.

254
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:41,000
Speaker 1: Like, if I share a game with Emily and it does not, like, break my Slay the Spire save, Emily has her own Slay the Spire save game, they're separate, it just works, it's really good.

255
00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:49,874
Speaker 1: And Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, just now, on October 31st, at 1621/41 UTC, released a patch.

256
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,179
Speaker 1: And this patch does exactly one thing.

257
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:04,460
Speaker 1: It removes the ability to do family sharing in Steam for this game.

258
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:05,996
Speaker 0: It just disables that.

259
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:25,420
Speaker 0: So on October 30th, if I had this game in my Steam library, because I bought it, and my kid had their own Steam account, and I indicated to Steam that we were in the same family, it would allow my kid to play that game on their account, even though we only bought it once on my account.

260
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,280
Speaker 0: And I don't think it lets both people play at the same time.

261
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,940
Speaker 1: You can't both play at the same time, which is a perfectly reasonable limitation.

262
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:45,620
Speaker 0: Yes, but you can still, either one of you can play it, because you're literally in the same family, it would be no different than if you bought a Zelda cartridge, and you had an NES, only one person can play it at a time, but you got three save files on there.

263
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,649
Speaker 1: And there are a few minor limitations, like, you can't play it at the same time as the other person.

264
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,894
Speaker 1: You can't play it in offline mode.

265
00:24:53,114 --> 00:24:55,700
Speaker 1: There's minor limitations, but it pretty much does just work.

266
00:24:56,481 --> 00:25:04,097
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, but on October 30th, you could do that with this game, and October 31st, and today, you can't.

267
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:05,540
Speaker 0: You would have to buy the game twice.

268
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:17,938
Speaker 0: Now, first of all, you can understand why a game company would think this is a good idea with their backwards capitalist mindset, but the reality is how many extra copies of the game is this going to sell?

269
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:19,120
Speaker 0: Not many.

270
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,080
Speaker 0: I cannot imagine that many extra copies of this game will sell.

271
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,000
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, how many 14 year olds are going to be so mad?

272
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:36,517
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, I can't prove that the number is going to be low, but my prediction is that the number of additional copies sold will be very low.

273
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,000
Speaker 0: It won't be zero, it'll be low.

274
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:49,820
Speaker 0: But the number of angry people, right, for example, the older sibling in a family bought the game and they used the family share, or the parent is a gamer because that's how old people are, right?

275
00:25:50,080 --> 00:26:06,260
Speaker 0: You got millennial parent buys the game and shares it with the kids who are old enough to be allowed to play it, and suddenly those kids are cut off and only the parent has it, but the kid was the one who was playing it the most, and you can't just transfer the game over to the kid's account now, right?

276
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:13,879
Speaker 0: But the kid has a save game and was playing it online with their friends, and now they can't, and it's like, you're going to really buy another copy, right?

277
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:15,820
Speaker 0: And there were games.

278
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,140
Speaker 0: Especially if you don't have a lot of money.

279
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:29,440
Speaker 1: There are games that don't support it out of the box, and Steam actually has a big disclaimer about that in the fact, but that's because those are games that, like, have an external account, and it's a matter of, those games never supported it from day one.

280
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,468
Speaker 0: You knew when you were buying the game that it wasn't supported.

281
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:38,400
Speaker 0: This is, you bought it, assuming this support was there, and now it's gone.

282
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:50,920
Speaker 0: They should at least, right, Steam should at least let you refund the game, because then in situations like the one I just described, the parent could refund it and use the money to buy the copy for the kid who plays it the most.

283
00:26:51,700 --> 00:27:00,660
Speaker 1: Now, as of when I got this article together earlier today for the Geek Nights episode, the company has made zero statement, and they did this without announcing anything.

284
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,493
Speaker 0: There's no- And this is obviously a popular game.

285
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:06,659
Speaker 1: I don't play it, but it's called- It is one of the most popular games on Steam right now.

286
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,877
Speaker 0: Indeed.

287
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,240
Speaker 1: Under, like, Counter-Strike.

288
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:19,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe their data was telling them that, like, there were kids who were, like, buying one copy and then, you know, familying, you know- But they can't play at the same time, so it wouldn't include those numbers.

289
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, with all their friends.

290
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:22,000
Speaker 0: Exactly, exactly.

291
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:32,558
Speaker 0: Like, I don't understand that- They're just, someone was just like, you know, probably some corporate dude was like, "Eh," and all the developers were like, "Eh," and then they had to do it.

292
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,999
Speaker 1: I mean, case in point, it's like a micro version of what's happening over at Twitter right now.

293
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically.

294
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:43,380
Speaker 0: So, even though I don't play Call of Duty and I don't like that game, it's a bullshit.

295
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:44,440
Speaker 0: It's a bullshit.

296
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,620
Speaker 0: I support you Call of Duty people in calling out this bullshit, especially if you were using it, so.

297
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:51,419
Speaker 1: Alright.

298
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:54,777
Speaker 0: I think Steam should be like, "Hey, if you don't support family, you can't be on

299
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:54,998
Speaker 0: Steam.".

300
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:55,581
Speaker 0: Yeah.

301
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:59,839
Speaker 1: Or you got, we take twice that double cut if you don't support it.

302
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,677
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

303
00:28:09,717 --> 00:28:10,160
Speaker 1: What do you got?

304
00:28:11,502 --> 00:28:13,080
Speaker 0: What did I have as thing of the day?

305
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,239
Speaker 1: The CSS Pokemon thing.

306
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:15,515
Speaker 0: Oh, right, so.

307
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,480
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool, I ended up on the stream.

308
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,662
Speaker 0: It is really cool, yeah.

309
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:31,500
Speaker 0: So, if you want to play a card game on the internet with other people, right, you gotta get, you know, there aren't really that many good, you know, implementations of that, except for, I guess, one we'll talk about today, our main bit.

310
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:39,100
Speaker 0: And, you know, games like Magic, the Magic Online, Hearthstone, obviously, right, a few others, there aren't many.

311
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:42,220
Speaker 0: It would be really nice if you could do it in the web browser.

312
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,740
Speaker 0: The problem is, is that making a good UI for a card game in the browser is tough.

313
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,960
Speaker 0: You know, even if you could make the UI good, it's not going to look fancy, like, look at the animations in Hearthstone, right?

314
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:02,620
Speaker 0: It's like, I stopped playing that game years ago, but it's like, you kind of need, it's like, they're not important for someone like me who just cares about the game.

315
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:16,940
Speaker 0: But it's like, you kind of need that to make a successful multiplayer online card game, right, to have it look good and fancy and all that biz, right, with the animations and the sound effects, because just cards, you know, it's tough, right?

316
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,478
Speaker 0: It's like, maybe you could be successful, but I don't know.

317
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:31,060
Speaker 0: So, it's like, well, if you're just in the web browser with, you know, where you don't really have much to work with, right, you don't have like a game, you know, fancy game engine going on, how are you going to make the cards look good?

318
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:58,440
Speaker 0: Well, here we have a obviously copyright infringing tech demo of a web development technique where they used CSS, some 3D transforms, some filters and some other techniques to be, it's not a whole game, but they're just made, you know, interactive in web browser cards that spin, move, light up.

319
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:02,660
Speaker 0: They're like, it's like, they look fantastic.

320
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,568
Speaker 0: These look better than any cards in any actual game engine card game.

321
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:15,559
Speaker 0: Like these are the best looking cards like to play with that are digital I have ever seen ever.

322
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,894
Speaker 0: And it's like, just copy this person's code and make an in web browser card game.

323
00:30:21,974 --> 00:30:23,980
Speaker 0: Obviously you can't make the Pokemon one to get in trouble.

324
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:28,892
Speaker 0: But it's like, this is, you got your, all this work is just already done for you.

325
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:32,710
Speaker 0: All you got to do is the rest, which is the other 90%.

326
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,359
Speaker 1: This is amazing.

327
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:36,785
Speaker 0: This is incredible, incredible work here.

328
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:44,440
Speaker 0: I can't, you know, somebody's going to someday in my life will make a card game where the, you know, digital card game where the cards are like this.

329
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,046
Speaker 0: Maybe it'll be me, but the source code is just fucking right there.

330
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:52,211
Speaker 0: GitHub, boom, GitHub, Pokemon cards, CSS.

331
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:52,873
Speaker 0: There it is.

332
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,237
Speaker 0: It's like, holy shit.

333
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:57,080
Speaker 0: Let's make it happen.

334
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:57,600
Speaker 1: Yeah.

335
00:30:58,142 --> 00:31:01,473
Speaker 1: So I got a little thing, but you may be familiar with an old game, Zoo Tycoon.

336
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:03,500
Speaker 1: It was a popular game a long time ago.

337
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,040
Speaker 0: It was in the same series, you know, with the railroad tycoon and the roller coaster tycoon and all those.

338
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,301
Speaker 0: Yup.

339
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:11,928
Speaker 1: This is a game from 2001.

340
00:31:11,928 --> 00:31:15,456
Speaker 1: Like I was, God, that actually was a long time ago yet.

341
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:17,180
Speaker 1: We were already in college, so.

342
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,381
Speaker 0: Yup.

343
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:19,403
Speaker 0: I never played it.

344
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,929
Speaker 0: I played like the first roller coaster tycoon a little bit.

345
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:26,380
Speaker 0: I guarded the first one, so I never bought or played any of them for an extended period.

346
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:40,360
Speaker 1: So this video is a short video, but it, it experiments with the game and determines the full details of a very specific behavior in the game when guests fall into or otherwise are in water.

347
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:46,732
Speaker 1: And what they determined is that you can only drown men in Zoo Tycoon.

348
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:49,557
Speaker 1: The people in the park are men, women or children.

349
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:50,700
Speaker 1: They have three like models.

350
00:31:52,262 --> 00:31:53,788
Speaker 1: Let's not get into gender stuff around there.

351
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:55,836
Speaker 1: This is an old game from 2001, so it is what it is.

352
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:07,560
Speaker 1: But if you set up implausible scenarios to trap someone in water, men will drown, women and children will be teleported to safety.

353
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:15,580
Speaker 1: Someone specifically designed this game to ensure that women and children cannot die no matter what you do, but men are fair game.

354
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:17,687
Speaker 1: It's not clear why.

355
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:20,660
Speaker 1: There is no game difference between those three kinds of players.

356
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,584
Speaker 0: Okay, so I did some research here.

357
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:31,340
Speaker 0: This game was made by Blue Fang Games, which was basically owned by Microsoft and then closed down when their Microsoft deal ended.

358
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,349
Speaker 0: They were in Massachusetts, right?

359
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,354
Speaker 0: They were founded in '98.

360
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:36,481
Speaker 0: They closed in 2011.

361
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:40,040
Speaker 0: Actually, they're not related to Roller Coaster Tycoon or Railroad Tycoon.

362
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,342
Speaker 1: Really?

363
00:32:40,382 --> 00:32:41,409
Speaker 1: Because they look like identical graphics.

364
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:48,500
Speaker 0: They're the same genre, yeah, but the games that were made by this studio were Zoo Tycoon, right?

365
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,131
Speaker 0: I think these are expansions for Zoo Tycoon.

366
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:55,460
Speaker 0: Zoo Tycoon 2, a bunch of expansions.

367
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,003
Speaker 0: Zoo Tycoon DS.

368
00:32:57,484 --> 00:32:59,208
Speaker 0: Zoo Tycoon 2 DS.

369
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:02,576
Speaker 0: World of Zoo in 2009 for Windows DS and Wii.

370
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,868
Speaker 0: A game in 2009 called Lion Pride for iOS.

371
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:11,840
Speaker 0: A game in 2010 for iOS called Lion Pride Huge.

372
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:13,726
Speaker 0: Another 2010 game for Facebook.

373
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:17,018
Speaker 1: That feels like a downward spiral into shitware.

374
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:17,580
Speaker 1: I don't know.

375
00:33:18,421 --> 00:33:20,828
Speaker 0: A 2010 Facebook game called Zoo Kingdom.

376
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,120
Speaker 0: A 2011 implementation of Carmen Sandiego for Facebook.

377
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,116
Speaker 0: And a 2011 implementation of Oregon Trail for Facebook.

378
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:29,920
Speaker 0: And then they were done.

379
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:40,760
Speaker 0: So the only games they really made that were successful or notable, but were indeed popular, successful, notable, and award-winning were Zoo Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon 2, etc.

380
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:45,020
Speaker 1: Really feels like the kind of game I would get a demo of in PC Gamer.

381
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:55,920
Speaker 1: But what's fascinating is in exploring this in the video, what we find is that the game has surprisingly complex drowning mechanics.

382
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:04,100
Speaker 1: Which makes the fact that they decided to prevent women and children from drowning with an additional separate mechanic all the more fascinating.

383
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:14,600
Speaker 1: A drowning male will only be able to see six tiles in the distance and will swim randomly until they see land or a safe place to get to and then try to get to it.

384
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,648
Speaker 1: And they have a stamina that will run out and eventually they'll just die.

385
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:21,800
Speaker 1: Women will just teleport somewhere on the map where they'll be safe.

386
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:27,199
Speaker 0: If you want some more advanced drowning, I would suggest Dwarf Fortress.

387
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,179
Speaker 0: Which is perhaps the most drowning-est game to ever be.

388
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,340
Speaker 1: In the metamoment, the Geegneis Book Club book apparently is still binty 'cause Sonic Segment didn't update the website yet.

389
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:43,759
Speaker 0: I had a reminder to do it, but then I didn't do it.

390
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:49,800
Speaker 1: I only make fun of you because I have forgotten to do it every time for at least a couple weeks before I finally do it.

391
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:52,119
Speaker 0: We're putting it on the list right now.

392
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:52,681
Speaker 1: Yep.

393
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:54,507
Speaker 1: But the Geegneis Book Club was binty.

394
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:55,391
Speaker 1: Just read it.

395
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:56,536
Speaker 1: It's fantastic.

396
00:34:56,576 --> 00:34:57,440
Speaker 1: We did the show on it.

397
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,926
Speaker 1: The new book has been announced.

398
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:00,051
Speaker 1: It looks really great.

399
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:00,734
Speaker 1: I already bought it.

400
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:02,100
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start reading it this weekend.

401
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:03,372
Speaker 0: Mhm.

402
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:15,059
Speaker 1: We will be, or either I will be or me and Scott will be at PAX Unplugged on Sunday giving a panel called "Why is this game taking 4

403
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:15,299
Speaker 1: hours?"

404
00:35:15,941 --> 00:35:19,960
Speaker 1: Which is a somewhat updated version of our "Take your fucking turn" panel.

405
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:25,420
Speaker 1: But nuance changed a little bit, removing some old examples, adding some new examples, etc.

406
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,086
Speaker 1: But we'll be there.

407
00:35:27,528 --> 00:35:28,673
Speaker 1: We'll only be there on Sunday.

408
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:30,140
Speaker 1: Don't expect us to be there any other days.

409
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:36,940
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens in regard to COVID and other PAXes and what the future holds for us doing live performances.

410
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:41,980
Speaker 1: I pretty much stopped using Twitter, so you're gonna keep seeing updates from me.

411
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,797
Speaker 1: Like, I'm not quitting Twitter in a big huff, but I'm just not going to it anymore, so...

412
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:49,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll probably talk about this on the next Monday episode, right?

413
00:35:50,480 --> 00:36:08,900
Speaker 0: But, you know, we've always, Geegneis has been following it pretty strictly, but personally I haven't, despite believing in it, I haven't followed it the most strictly throughout my life, but there's a model called the Posse Model, which is where you publish your work on your own site, POS, and then you syndicate it elsewhere.

414
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:18,486
Speaker 0: So you treat other platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube as just places to basically copy your shit to, to get it out there so people can find it.

415
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:23,540
Speaker 0: But your official location for any of your own work is your own website.

416
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:33,840
Speaker 0: You publish everything yourself, and then when you post on other websites, you're either posting copies, and you're hopefully including links back to your own site, and you just do that for everything.

417
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:41,520
Speaker 0: And then if people only want to use those other sites, okay, they can still see whatever content you choose to send over there.

418
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:48,900
Speaker 0: And if they don't want to come to your site, okay, they don't have to, but they can, and you'll never lose your shit, right?

419
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:55,060
Speaker 0: I've seen so many sites, you know, platforms from GeoCities onward disappear over the years.

420
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:06,680
Speaker 0: If you do, if you do things this way, you can never get burned, because your stuff will always be where it was in its true original location, as long as you can keep it up.

421
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,539
Speaker 0: So I'm going to move to that model more strictly for the remaining years of my life.

422
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:20,980
Speaker 1: We have both been through this rodeo of a platform becoming the most important platform in the world and then disappearing.

423
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,452
Speaker 0: It's happened so many times.

424
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:40,679
Speaker 0: Right, it's my last rodeo for this, so I'm just going to transfer to basically having everything on my own shit, and if another site comes up and I happen to syndicate to it, it's like, okay, and if that site dies, okay, it's just a place I'm syndicating to, what do I care, right, you know?

425
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:51,920
Speaker 0: Whereas now, it's like I unwisely invested in some platforms, you know, and then they die, and it's like, well, I learned my lesson, that's enough of that.

426
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,640
Speaker 1: Downloaded my 6.5 gigabytes of Twitter archive.

427
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,480
Speaker 0: Oh, I mean, I've been downloading it monthly for quite some time.

428
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,000
Speaker 1: I was doing it like biannually, because I wasn't that fussed, because I had most of the archive, but I got one last.

429
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:10,020
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, I have like reminders set to back up things to my NAS that I can't do automatically.

430
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:17,040
Speaker 1: Yup, so I say that because you're going to keep seeing like geek nights announcements happen for my Twitter, but like don't add me.

431
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:26,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're going to continue, don't, you know, whatever, you know, you have to decide on your own listener, which web platforms, which internet services you're going to use, that's up to you.

432
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:32,140
Speaker 1: And like to be clear, I'm not making a moral stand, I'm not quitting Twitter in a like, we should all quit it for more reasons.

433
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,240
Speaker 1: I just don't like using Twitter anymore.

434
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:41,940
Speaker 0: I have opinions on which platforms I like and don't like, but I'm not going to try to, you know, tell other people what they should or should not do.

435
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:48,640
Speaker 0: I might, you know, air my opinions, but it's like, you know, you do what you got to do, and I'll meet you where you are, right?

436
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:55,300
Speaker 0: If that's the thing you want to use, I'll post links, you know, so you can get notified the way you want to get notified.

437
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,010
Speaker 0: It doesn't really hurt me, it doesn't help those platforms.

438
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,118
Speaker 0: that much, you know, big deal.

439
00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:03,425
Speaker 0: As long as it's easy enough to do, what do I care?

440
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:09,936
Speaker 0: I'll meet you where you are at, but I'm not going to participate in the other places, right?

441
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,740
Speaker 0: It's like the time for that is pretty much over.

442
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,780
Speaker 1: I feel like I will still post to Reddit occasionally, but that's sort of a different type of use case.

443
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,111
Speaker 1: I don't generate content to Reddit.

444
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,740
Speaker 1: I just write comments on Reddit.

445
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:26,940
Speaker 0: Well, we'll talk about it more on the Monday.

446
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:33,875
Speaker 1: But yeah, don't at me on Twitter, and if Twitter is the only way you know to reach me, DM me.

447
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:35,138
Speaker 1: I'm keeping my DMs open.

448
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:36,280
Speaker 1: I do get the DMs.

449
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,517
Speaker 0: You can always email.

450
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,484
Speaker 1: Yeah, email works, guys.

451
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:41,651
Speaker 1: Email still exists.

452
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,500
Speaker 1: Our email address is real easy to figure out.

453
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,795
Speaker 1: And I am going to make a concerted, because I'm not looking at Twitter anymore, I'm going to replace at least some of that time.

454
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:58,060
Speaker 1: I would spend wasting my life on Twitter, looking at the Geek Nights forum more than I have.

455
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,820
Speaker 0: Wasting your time on your own shit instead of wasting your time on someone else's shit.

456
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,280
Speaker 1: I mean, if you're going to waste time, you're better off smelling your own farts than smelling someone else's farts.

457
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,040
Speaker 1: If farts are what you're after.

458
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,960
Speaker 0: In the attention economy, if you got attention and you're going to burn it, might as well burn it in your own stove, keeping yourself warm.

459
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:21,610
Speaker 1: So, Marvel Snap is an online digital game.

460
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,514
Speaker 1: It came out this month.

461
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:26,000
Speaker 1: It's on, I guess, computers.

462
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:27,747
Speaker 1: Well, not everything.

463
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:29,720
Speaker 1: It's not on the Switch, even though I think it would be great on the Switch.

464
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,600
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought it was on the Switch.

465
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,820
Speaker 1: No, it's only on Android, iOS, and Windows.

466
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:33,820
Speaker 0: Okay.

467
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,023
Speaker 1: Yeah, nothing else.

468
00:40:35,344 --> 00:40:40,500
Speaker 1: That's most things, but I feel like they're leaving money on the table by not having a Switch port.

469
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:47,620
Speaker 0: So, a lot of the premier developers who worked on Hearthstone at Blizzard, they left long ago.

470
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:50,620
Speaker 0: I think we must have talked about it when it happened.

471
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Speaker 0: And they went to create a new studio called Second Dinner, which is a joke I presume is related to the second breakfast that hobbits eat.

472
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:06,940
Speaker 0: And they were working on something, and we assumed it had to be card game-ish because they were all Hearthstone devs.

473
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:10,960
Speaker 0: And we knew that there was some news that came out that they had a Marvel license.

474
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,600
Speaker 0: But not until, literally, they did the Apple approach, right?

475
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,300
Speaker 0: Basically, they fucking announced the thing and released it pretty much on top of each other.

476
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,646
Speaker 0: Like, here it is, right?

477
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,299
Speaker 0: They weren't like, Marvel Snap coming next year, right?

478
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,955
Speaker 0: They're like, Marvel Snap, fucking here it is, bitches.

479
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:29,820
Speaker 0: It's out, right?

480
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:34,800
Speaker 1: I believe there was a brief early access period on Steam in Windows.

481
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:39,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were some beta early access type periods of some kind.

482
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:47,860
Speaker 0: But it's like, it pretty much, you know, unless you were deep into it with them, it's like, you know, the majority of people didn't know about it until, here it is.

483
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:48,541
Speaker 1: Yup.

484
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:52,800
Speaker 1: So I think we should, let's talk about the game itself first, because that's a more interesting conversation.

485
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:59,140
Speaker 1: Before we talk about the monetization and the problems with the ecosystem around it.

486
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:05,020
Speaker 1: Because I gotta say, like, TL;DL, the game itself is a really solid, well-designed game.

487
00:42:05,701 --> 00:42:08,360
Speaker 0: Well, they stole from the Forgotten Masters, right?

488
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:14,600
Speaker 0: You might go back into the Geek Nights archives and find an episode we did about Rainer Knizia's battle line, right?

489
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,120
Speaker 0: Which is also known as, what, Shot N' Totten?

490
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:19,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, Shot N' Totten came first, I want to say.

491
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:29,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but basically, there are several games that are, that I guess originated with Knizia, that are very similar in mechanics, right?

492
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,400
Speaker 0: There's also the Warhammer LCG, which, I forget what that one's called.

493
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:34,665
Speaker 1: Yeah.

494
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:41,080
Speaker 0: The Warhammer LCG, was it the, I think it's the Invasion one, if I'm not mistaken.

495
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,420
Speaker 1: But these games all follow a pattern.

496
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:50,860
Speaker 0: Yes, Warhammer Invasion is also in the same kind of, you know, realm of game.

497
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:56,520
Speaker 1: The pattern is basically, there'll be some number of zones of some kind lined up in a row.

498
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:04,340
Speaker 1: And you take turns playing cards that have various amounts of power in some capacity into those zones.

499
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,160
Speaker 1: And the zones have some sort of limit on how many things can be in the zone, usually.

500
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:25,060
Speaker 1: And there are some conditions where you win or lose a zone, and whoever controls the most zones, or maybe some variations on that theme, like battle line has some additional ways to win, like controlling three zones that are next to each other, you win the game.

501
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,047
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a lot like, you know, a Colonel Blotto, right?

502
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:35,160
Speaker 0: Only, there's no, like, you know, the adjacencies are much simpler because you don't have a map, right?

503
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:35,519
Speaker 0: Yep.

504
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:41,435
Speaker 0: And, you know, there'll be like less options, and every single location is worth the same amount, right?

505
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,300
Speaker 0: They're all worth one location, right?

506
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:53,680
Speaker 0: Whereas like El Grande, the different locations, like when you hold them, how long you hold them, you know, it's like, you go from El Grande, you simplify and make it, you know, linear, and that's battle line.

507
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:59,680
Speaker 0: And you make it even simpler, and you only have three locations total, and it's just two out of three, that's Marvel Snap.

508
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,700
Speaker 0: Marvel Snap is like the baby's firstest battle line Colonel Blotto, like that you can get.

509
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:20,580
Speaker 0: It's like as easy and as simple as you can make it while still having it be a game, but even though it's such a, like, it's like they removed so much, but the game is guaranteed to be six turns.

510
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,920
Speaker 0: There's, I think, a rare occasion.

511
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,200
Speaker 1: Well, it can be four turns.

512
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,719
Speaker 1: It can also be four turns.

513
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,048
Speaker 0: It's also rare occasions.

514
00:44:27,108 --> 00:44:30,240
Speaker 0: only four turns, yes, but most of the time it's six turns.

515
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,620
Speaker 0: It takes less than a minute, basically.

516
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,420
Speaker 1: A whole match, even if the other player takes forever to take their turn.

517
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,800
Speaker 1: We're talking 90 seconds, start to finish, game's over.

518
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:46,400
Speaker 1: So total aside, I pulled up battle line just to like bring up a screen for the listener on the stream.

519
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:53,880
Speaker 1: Someone made their own version of battle line, and it's all Simpsons characters, and it is like top tier.

520
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:56,859
Speaker 1: This is way too high quality what this person did.

521
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,579
Speaker 0: Of course, right?

522
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:09,160
Speaker 0: So Marvel Snap is basically, all right, look, you're not going to get the rich, you know, in-depth complex version that you get with El Grande or battle line where you get, you know, sit there for a little while.

523
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:13,260
Speaker 0: But you're going to be able to get like that game mechanic.

524
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:16,840
Speaker 0: Like you're going to exercise, you know, like flex that muscle like three times.

525
00:45:17,022 --> 00:45:17,716
Speaker 0: Like one, two, three.

526
00:45:18,023 --> 00:45:18,213
Speaker 0: Right.

527
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,760
Speaker 0: And it's not, it's like you'll get some amount of juice for that fruit.

528
00:45:22,229 --> 00:45:22,440
Speaker 0: Right.

529
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:23,760
Speaker 0: It's not like you're getting nothing.

530
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,100
Speaker 0: It's like you're getting a little bit of game, game juice.

531
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:26,897
Speaker 0: Right.

532
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,840
Speaker 0: And it takes so little time.

533
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:29,758
Speaker 0: It's like, you know what?

534
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,600
Speaker 0: Time invested versus game juice received.

535
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:42,440
Speaker 0: It's like if you sit there and play Marvel Snap for an hour or play El Grande once, you might get more juice out of the Marvel Snap just because there's so many iterations.

536
00:45:42,621 --> 00:45:44,600
Speaker 1: In fact, this ties into that one El Grande.

537
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:46,819
Speaker 1: Remember our take your fucking turn title where we are.

538
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:54,140
Speaker 1: Our core argument was that a very short game that's pretty good is probably better by most measures than a very long game.

539
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,017
Speaker 1: That's very good.

540
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,095
Speaker 0: Yeah.

541
00:45:56,781 --> 00:46:01,299
Speaker 0: So in Marvel Snap, you basically construct a small deck of cards, very small.

542
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:01,740
Speaker 0: Right.

543
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:04,260
Speaker 1: And there can only be drawn of any card.

544
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:08,760
Speaker 1: So you can't have like, you can't have ten to Spider-Man and have to Spider-Man.

545
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:09,060
Speaker 0: Right.

546
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:10,420
Speaker 0: Each card is unique.

547
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,019
Speaker 0: So it's a completely every one of each.

548
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:13,480
Speaker 0: Right.

549
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:13,815
Speaker 0: That's it.

550
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,260
Speaker 0: And they're all Marvel superheroes.

551
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,120
Speaker 0: And, you know, while there's a collecting aspect to the game, and usually I hate that shit.

552
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,840
Speaker 0: I'm someone who grew up collecting superhero cards mostly.

553
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,760
Speaker 1: So we collected mostly the same cards.

554
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,080
Speaker 1: And these art, the art on these cards evokes the exact art on the fucking cards I collected as a kid.

555
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:36,300
Speaker 0: They're really nice fucking cards.

556
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,340
Speaker 0: I really like superhero cards.

557
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,460
Speaker 1: I feel like I can smell the cards when I'm playing Marvel Snap.

558
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:41,600
Speaker 1: Yeah.

559
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,459
Speaker 1: Part of my brain says you should be able to smell these.

560
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,400
Speaker 0: They're real nice cards.

561
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,540
Speaker 0: So on your turn, you basically take simultaneous turns, which is, we love that.

562
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:50,880
Speaker 0: Right.

563
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,420
Speaker 0: No waiting.

564
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:51,711
Speaker 0: Right.

565
00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:56,980
Speaker 0: And you on your turn, you can play a card to one of the three locations.

566
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:00,140
Speaker 0: Every superhero has a value of how strong they are.

567
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,519
Speaker 1: You can play any number of cards.

568
00:47:02,562 --> 00:47:03,039
Speaker 0: That's true.

569
00:47:03,581 --> 00:47:05,532
Speaker 0: But you have mana.

570
00:47:05,632 --> 00:47:06,940
Speaker 0: basically that scales up.

571
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,137
Speaker 0: Right.

572
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,040
Speaker 0: So in turn one, you can play one mana worth of cards.

573
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:12,360
Speaker 0: And on turn two, you can play two mana worth of cards.

574
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,460
Speaker 1: That has been the pattern for a while now for these kinds of games across the board.

575
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,619
Speaker 1: The just linear mana ramp up.

576
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,080
Speaker 0: And have you seen any mechanics that let anyone cheat that system?

577
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:23,960
Speaker 1: Not one.

578
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,040
Speaker 1: The only mechanics I've seen that interact with that at all.

579
00:47:27,321 --> 00:47:32,100
Speaker 1: There are some locations that will give both players a bunch of extra mana one round.

580
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,100
Speaker 0: Which sure.

581
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:33,374
Speaker 0: Yup.

582
00:47:33,902 --> 00:47:35,140
Speaker 1: And there is one location.

583
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,219
Speaker 0: As long as it's even, that's fair.

584
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,300
Speaker 1: There's one location.

585
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:42,880
Speaker 1: If you have no cards in that location, you get one extra mana every turn.

586
00:47:44,421 --> 00:47:47,120
Speaker 0: There's also a location that we'll discuss because it's hilarious.

587
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:52,880
Speaker 0: Both players at random, right, have one card from their hand.

588
00:47:53,301 --> 00:47:55,520
Speaker 0: Just come and get played at that location for free.

589
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,859
Speaker 0: You have no control over it.

590
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,959
Speaker 1: There's a worse one.

591
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:00,960
Speaker 1: You both get a card put in your hand without your control.

592
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:08,120
Speaker 1: And there's another card, Agatha Harkness, which if that card is in your hand, the mechanic is, the AI plays your entire turn.

593
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:08,900
Speaker 1: You can't play the game.

594
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,759
Speaker 1: The AI plays for you the entire match.

595
00:48:12,202 --> 00:48:13,669
Speaker 0: Does ego the living planet?

596
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:15,196
Speaker 0: who plays for you, right?

597
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:19,560
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's all kinds of wacky stuff.

598
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:22,400
Speaker 0: They obviously borrowed a lot from hearthstone.

599
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,560
Speaker 1: These cards range from Cyclops, he's just a strong guy, to card that makes an AI play for you like we just described.

600
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,459
Speaker 1: They're all over the place.

601
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,760
Speaker 0: But anyway, you play cards at the locations, right?

602
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:37,680
Speaker 0: And then whoever has more total power at a location is the winner of that location.

603
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,680
Speaker 0: Whoever wins two out of the three locations is the winner of the entire game.

604
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,200
Speaker 0: That's that, right?

605
00:48:44,361 --> 00:48:48,560
Speaker 1: If there is a tie, because ties are pretty common, actually.

606
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:51,600
Speaker 0: I didn't experience any, but I didn't play that long.

607
00:48:51,901 --> 00:48:54,400
Speaker 1: I played until I got to near gold rank.

608
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:55,978
Speaker 1: I played it a lot, just to really...

609
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,755
Speaker 0: I played until I lost a game, which was both longer and shorter.

610
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:09,640
Speaker 1: So if there is a tie, because you could be tied on one or more locations, like that could happen easily.

611
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:14,985
Speaker 1: Because there are locations where the location power is like, "Cards can't be played here.

612
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:17,255
Speaker 1: Any card played here is immediately

613
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:17,697
Speaker 1: destroyed.".

614
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,680
Speaker 0: But there are other guys like Nightcrawler who you can play and then move after you play them.

615
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,180
Speaker 0: So that's how you can get power at a location, even though you can't play anyone directly to the location.

616
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:36,480
Speaker 1: But if there is a tie, the power differential among the total power on your side versus the total power on their side is the tiebreaker.

617
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:40,060
Speaker 1: I do not know what the tiebreaker is if that is also tied.

618
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:41,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

619
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,259
Speaker 1: The fact didn't say it last I checked either.

620
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of unspoken rules, right?

621
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,760
Speaker 0: Because it's such a straightforward game.

622
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,400
Speaker 0: Hearthstone made the same mistake because they didn't provide a complete rulebook, right?

623
00:49:53,881 --> 00:50:02,180
Speaker 0: So the only way to know weird situations is to do science, encounter those situations, and see what the code does.

624
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,540
Speaker 1: What I can say, though, is this game does something that's rare.

625
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:07,939
Speaker 1: It does the Glory to Rome thing.

626
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:18,360
Speaker 1: Pretty much every time I've seen an interaction, and I feel like if that plays out the way it logically should, it's going to be really, really ridiculous.

627
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,239
Speaker 1: And the ridiculous thing just happens.

628
00:50:20,582 --> 00:50:23,060
Speaker 1: You got eight hulks out there out of nowhere suddenly.

629
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,449
Speaker 1: The crazy thing seems to happen.

630
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,640
Speaker 1: if the crazy thing seems like it makes sense to happen.

631
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:28,339
Speaker 0: Of course.

632
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:33,100
Speaker 1: And the cool part is, in a more serious game that takes longer, that would suck.

633
00:50:33,601 --> 00:50:35,010
Speaker 1: Like, "Oh, the weird thing happened.

634
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:35,613
Speaker 1: The game just went

635
00:50:35,714 --> 00:50:36,136
Speaker 1: crazy.".

636
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:41,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, the guy has eight hulks on turn three, and now you have to play the rest of the game for another half hour.

637
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, this game takes 90 seconds.

638
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,480
Speaker 1: Right, so someone hits a bunch of hulks.

639
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,215
Speaker 0: It's like, "Alright, I lost that one.

640
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:48,538
Speaker 0: Next.".

641
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:50,079
Speaker 1: And there's a resign button.

642
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:57,539
Speaker 1: And this is where the game gets brilliant, because this game did something I never expected, a game that is clearly aimed at children, to do.

643
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,900
Speaker 1: It has a backgammon-esque doubling cube.

644
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:28,880
Speaker 0: Yup, so the backgammon-esque doubling cube takes a game that would otherwise be a very baby's first child's baby version of a game, and adds a significant strategic element that raises the skill cap somewhat significantly, and makes play actually interesting for advanced players without really hurting it for weaker players.

645
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:37,639
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if you're good at the doubling cube, then obviously when you win, you'll win more, and when you lose, you'll lose less.

646
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:51,440
Speaker 0: But it doesn't matter, because let's say you're low skill, and you don't play the doubling cube properly, okay, and when you win, you'll still win, and when you lose, you still lose, but you'll just win less and lose more.

647
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,550
Speaker 0: But it's like, who wins and loses doesn't change.

648
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:57,000
Speaker 0: Just how much is won and lost changes.

649
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,939
Speaker 0: So, not a big deal.

650
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,049
Speaker 1: What is this, how much?

651
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:01,040
Speaker 1: What are we wagering?

652
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:12,037
Speaker 1: It's basically, there's like a million currencies in this game, we'll get to that part of this in a second, but there is cubes, and the cubes are how you advance through the actual ranks.

653
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:21,380
Speaker 1: Like, higher cubes mean you're match made with other players who also have higher cubes, and that's kind of the progression system through the game.

654
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,540
Speaker 0: And the snap is an allusion to the Infinity Gauntlet.

655
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:26,140
Speaker 1: Yup, if you didn't pick up on that.

656
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:28,891
Speaker 0: The Marvel theme is very strong.

657
00:52:29,835 --> 00:52:30,899
Speaker 0: They just went all in on it.

658
00:52:34,622 --> 00:52:40,720
Speaker 1: Yup, so, oh my god, I just played a game on my phone, and I literally got harkness, and it's playing for me, and now I can't play.

659
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:41,951
Speaker 1: So, so much for that.

660
00:52:42,398 --> 00:52:42,539
Speaker 0: Anyway.

661
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,444
Speaker 0: I uninstalled it.

662
00:52:44,188 --> 00:52:46,480
Speaker 0: I actually never had it on my phone, I only played it on Steam.

663
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:54,940
Speaker 1: The way the doubling cube works in this game, the snap, is you play the game normally, and at the end of the game, whoever wins gets some cubes, whoever loses loses some cubes.

664
00:52:55,522 --> 00:53:00,520
Speaker 1: At any time, either player can click the snap, and it does a big graphical, like, snap.

665
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:05,500
Speaker 1: It basically doubles the stakes of how many cubes are going to be won or lost.

666
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:19,340
Speaker 1: When someone snaps, your options are either continue playing, and the elevated stakes take effect starting the next round, or resign, just quit, just give up, cut your losses, and you only lose that initial cube.

667
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,060
Speaker 1: You don't, like, the doubling doesn't actually happen.

668
00:53:22,705 --> 00:53:24,620
Speaker 1: So, you can snap, and the other person just quits.

669
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:37,640
Speaker 1: Once you've snapped, you can't snap again, the other player, just like in backgammon, at any time if they want, they can snap, and double the stakes again, and you'll either have to accept that, or quit yourself.

670
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:59,259
Speaker 0: That's basically identical to what the backgammon doubling cube does, and pretty much, we can have a strategic discussion about how it, you know, adds bluffing mechanics to the game, and how it adds, you know, it rewards people with good positional heuristics, like, if you know you're winning, right, then it's, it rewards, it gives you a reward, because now you know you're, you know, you can, not only can you...

671
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:07,220
Speaker 1: Doubling cubes are an advanced game mechanic that are, that is, I would say it is one of the most interesting and powerful core game mechanics there is.

672
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:08,257
Speaker 1: Like, it's up there.

673
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:17,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really, it's really simple, but it adds a whole lot to a game for players to think about, and they threw it in there, and there you go.

674
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,020
Speaker 0: Good, great, genius, perfect idea, amazing.

675
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:25,680
Speaker 1: I have won many matches, because I bluffed and snapped in the last round when I had bupkis in my hand.

676
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,739
Speaker 0: Yup, bluffing works.

677
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,000
Speaker 1: And the locations are great too, like, the locations...

678
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,699
Speaker 0: You can't bluff and backgammon though, because it's not like someone, you can't prove that you're gonna get, know that you're gonna get to roll sixes, right?

679
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:41,760
Speaker 1: Backgammon is just knowing, backgammon the cube really just tests, do you know basic statistics?

680
00:54:42,804 --> 00:54:42,996
Speaker 0: Yeah.

681
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,080
Speaker 1: Of lots of rolls of 26.

682
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,200
Speaker 0: Or, are you, are you cheating?

683
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, are you cheating is a big part too.

684
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,480
Speaker 0: But, uh... Are you, or are you a risk taker, I don't know.

685
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,379
Speaker 1: So here's the problem.

686
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,940
Speaker 1: Everything about the game itself is actually pretty great.

687
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,000
Speaker 1: Like, there is, I have zero complaints about this game.

688
00:55:00,101 --> 00:55:00,439
Speaker 1: In fact...

689
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:08,960
Speaker 0: Well, okay, the complaint I would have about the game, right, is that, you know, when I, I basically, I played it, and I played it until I lost.

690
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:17,540
Speaker 0: And the one match I lost, right, we'll tell the funny story, right, a location appeared, well first, a location appeared that said everyone gets rocks in their hand.

691
00:55:18,003 --> 00:55:20,800
Speaker 0: And the rock is basically just a, it's a rock, literally a rock.

692
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:28,720
Speaker 0: And it's just a card that's basically worthless, that has no power, but to get it out of your hand costs a mana, so, and it takes up a spot on the board.

693
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,960
Speaker 0: So unless you have some other card to synergize with the rock that would make it advantageous, you're not gonna play it, it's just gonna take up space in your hand.

694
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,940
Speaker 0: There's a lot of, it's like a curse in Dominion, right?

695
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:45,580
Speaker 0: So I got some, we both had rocks in our hand, because everything in the game is even fair like that when it's random, which is nice.

696
00:55:46,662 --> 00:55:47,944
Speaker 0: And then another location appeared.

697
00:55:47,984 --> 00:55:57,220
Speaker 0: that said, both players, at random, to have one card from their hand automatically played at this location for free, right?

698
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:07,180
Speaker 0: And so the other player had rocks in their hand, and so did I, but a rock came out of my hand for free, which is, you know, it's not that harmful, it eats up a spot, I didn't lose a mana.

699
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:14,720
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's out of my hand, which is nice, but it's like, it's obviously the worst result, you'd rather get something big for free, right?

700
00:56:15,221 --> 00:56:24,900
Speaker 0: The other player got the hulk for free at that location, right, who is, it's like, some other people have reported this exact scenario happening, so I wonder if it's a scripted thing.

701
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:37,520
Speaker 1: So, the exact same thing happened to me in one of my early matches, the exact same thing happened to our friend Matt in one of his early matches, the exact same thing happened to some people I saw on Twitter, because I was still looking at Twitter back then.

702
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:57,820
Speaker 1: We have a lot of evidence that many, possibly most, of your early plays, if you start playing this game from nothing, are scripted entirely, not just to teach you the game, but to expose you to the highs and lows of the game, and make it an engaging and interesting experience.

703
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:03,580
Speaker 0: Because remember, one of the things that Richard Garfield talked about-- And expose you to the mechanics of the game without the interference of another person.

704
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:14,136
Speaker 1: But also expose you to, like, the high highs and the low lows, like, the ridiculous once-in-a-lifetime nonsense that happens in a game, the wombo combo that you celebrate.

705
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:16,920
Speaker 1: You experience that, like, on your fourth game ever.

706
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,068
Speaker 0: Yep, so this, obviously, is, on the one hand, incredible, right?

707
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:28,078
Speaker 0: That's a hilarious play, it's thematic, it's fun, if it happened at a tournament, people would be going like, "Oh, shit!

708
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:28,139
Speaker 1: Oh!"

709
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:29,301
Speaker 1: Right?

710
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:32,607
Speaker 0: But it's entirely luck-based, right?

711
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:40,100
Speaker 0: I didn't lose, up until that point, I had not lost a single game, and I only lost that game because of luck.

712
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,940
Speaker 1: But remember, a game takes between 20 and 90 seconds to play.

713
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:52,017
Speaker 0: Yep, but I told myself when I started, because I could clearly tell what kind of game this was, that I would uninstall as soon as I lost.

714
00:57:52,257 --> 00:57:53,160
Speaker 0: So that was my final game.

715
00:57:53,160 --> 00:58:00,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have played several hundred games of this to really, like, interrogate the mechanics, and I am at a point where I only win about half my games.

716
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:26,360
Speaker 1: The advanced play will get into the whole collectible nonsense and, like, the problems with the monetization in a second, but assuming you have all the cards, and you're not just, like, lacking a card that someone has that's just better, then the game comes down to who made the most clever deck with a little bit of paper-rock-scissors, and after that, who plays perfectly mathematically optimally, which, if you're a reasonably intelligent adult, not hard to do.

717
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:33,480
Speaker 0: And then number three-- No, but a professional player, even the most professional players will make a mistake sometimes, right?

718
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:36,020
Speaker 0: And in those games, they're gonna lose because they made a mistake.

719
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:42,770
Speaker 1: Yep, and then the third thing is it will just be random, but that's where the doubling cube comes in, because this game is more like poker.

720
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:47,817
Speaker 1: If you're playing this game seriously, forgetting the collectible card shit will get into.

721
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,020
Speaker 1: I keep saying that because it's a deal-breaker, that part.

722
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:55,750
Speaker 1: The real skill is, if random shit happens, just resign.

723
00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:02,420
Speaker 1: Like, you gotta use that cube, that snap, effectively and elegantly-- As soon as the Hulk came out, I resigned.

724
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,280
Speaker 0: I might have actually played one more card and then resigned.

725
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,361
Speaker 1: Yep, you just resign.

726
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:25,280
Speaker 1: And if you treat this game like poker, play it well, make good decks, study the meta, and you are very willing to resign and you don't snap stupidly, the game is still on the level, if you play dozens of games, primarily skill-based in the end, because you're gonna advance faster if you are smarter and better.

727
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:48,240
Speaker 0: If you're smarter and better at this game, even though every individual game will be determined by luck or what cards people drew or my deck happened to be a rock to his deck scissors or vice versa, even though all those things on the level of an individual match, you're not gonna be able to really have much control over the result.

728
00:59:49,061 --> 01:00:04,980
Speaker 0: If your positional heuristics and understanding of the game and just knowing who's going to win earlier, right, are better than the other players, over the course of many, many games, you will win more and lose less and rise in the ranks and be better.

729
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:11,980
Speaker 0: I would also say-- Even though, once you get to some certain rank, the outcomes of individual matches are primarily luck-based.

730
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:12,240
Speaker 0: Yep,

731
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:30,180
Speaker 1: I would also say that even though you will definitely lose games by absolute, uncontrollable, ridiculous randomness, because the games are so short, that ends up being fun, to the point that I'm not even mad about stasis decks, not even mad about, like, literally lose control of the game.

732
01:00:30,281 --> 01:00:32,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could just resign immediately, too.

733
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:40,907
Speaker 1: Or just let it play, and within 40 seconds, you are playing a brand new match, and it really just washes out.

734
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:47,613
Speaker 1: The skill will come to the top, except this is a free-to-play game, and the way they monetize it is.

735
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:55,660
Speaker 1: you either have to grind a terrifying amount to get all the cards, and the later cards are just better.

736
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,819
Speaker 0: Like, there are combos-- Not all of them, but most of them.

737
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:05,054
Speaker 1: But also, without the later cards, you cannot do anything advanced, you cannot make good, clever combos.

738
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,900
Speaker 1: You are just missing out on the fun part of the game.

739
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:15,511
Speaker 0: Right, so the way the unlocking works is that there's a whole bunch of different, bunch of fucking systems, right, because they can just have one way to do it, right?

740
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:16,973
Speaker 0: They can have all these different ways, right?

741
01:01:17,034 --> 01:01:25,580
Speaker 0: It's like, you level up your fucking season pass by playing and winning-- It is poisonous, toxic free-to-play, just like every other poisonous, toxic free-to-play.

742
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:35,215
Speaker 0: Right, it's like when you play cards, those cards that you play get points, and when a card gets enough points, it can upgrade, right, and frame break, and all that, right?

743
01:01:35,235 --> 01:01:38,420
Speaker 0: So basically, the cards upgrade individually, cosmetically, right?

744
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,225
Speaker 0: So you start off with a boring Spider-Man card, just a regular old Spider-Man card, right?

745
01:01:42,605 --> 01:01:45,228
Speaker 0: And you eventually upgrade that Spider-Man card.

746
01:01:45,248 --> 01:01:54,660
Speaker 0: It gets fancier looking, there's holograms and alternate arts, and each card has several different visual, you know, cosmetic options, right?

747
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,045
Speaker 0: Many of which are, they're all fucking awesome, right, all of them.

748
01:01:59,245 --> 01:02:02,028
Speaker 0: The artist team, they're S tier, right?

749
01:02:02,108 --> 01:02:12,760
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, and it's Marvel, so I guess it's even easier, right, to get all that years of IP to work on, but, you know, still amazing art, you know, however easy you want to say it is, I couldn't draw any of that shit.

750
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:25,940
Speaker 0: But, you upgrade cards cosmetically, and the more you do that, the more you level up on this other meter that unlocks actual cards that you can now have the option to put into your deck, right?

751
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:36,640
Speaker 0: So, you can spend fucking real money to unlock shit, but it costs a lot, I didn't calculate how much, I'm sure someone on the internet did, but it ain't cheap, it ain't worth it.

752
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,109
Speaker 0: Nope.

753
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:42,040
Speaker 0: Or, you can grind your way, just keep playing until you unlock all the cards.

754
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:59,356
Speaker 1: So, as far as I have played, I have played many hundreds of matches, I ranked up to upper silver local, I do not have even, like, half the cards, and 100% of the time I lose a match, the other person has a card I don't have.

755
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:03,020
Speaker 1: that is a way better combo, and I have no way to counter that.

756
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:04,241
Speaker 0: Nope.

757
01:03:05,003 --> 01:03:11,179
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I mean, if this game offered some option that was, like, a reasonable price, say, 20 bucks.

758
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:13,440
Speaker 1: I would pay 40 bucks to just have every card.

759
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,254
Speaker 0: Or, monthly fee, I would pay 5 bucks a month, right?

760
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,880
Speaker 0: Some, yeah, maybe.

761
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:20,802
Speaker 0: Cos the game is.

762
01:03:21,242 --> 01:03:31,200
Speaker 1: objectively, I thought about how, you could play probably 10 to 15 snaps in the time it takes to play one Nershima Hex, it's a better poopin' game than Nershima Hex.

763
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:37,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I was saying, it's like, you know, because it's a game that's continuously updated, they're always adding more content, right?

764
01:03:37,993 --> 01:03:41,580
Speaker 0: So, it's like, if I pay 30 bucks once for all the cards, it's like, well, now they add new cards.

765
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:47,240
Speaker 1: But if I had to pay, like, 10 bucks a season to get the next set of cards, I'm not even opposed to that.

766
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:59,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not opposed to paying for this game, what I'm opposed to is that even a substantial time or money investment, I don't even care about getting all the cosmetics, even though it's actually kinda awesome in this game, right?

767
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:08,080
Speaker 0: It's like, I just wanna be on a level playing field with the top, you know, with everybody else, and have every card, and I want my opponents to have every card.

768
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,220
Speaker 0: I don't wanna just win because I got some card the other person doesn't have, that's some bullshit, right?

769
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:24,040
Speaker 0: I want everyone to have access to all the same cards, and then play that very good, you know, light game in the spare moments of my day, and then I would be into it.

770
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,340
Speaker 0: But because that is not the way it is done, I uninstalled the game.

771
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:38,300
Speaker 1: The grind is exponential to get all the cards, it is the full-on free-to-play experience, there are at least three currencies in-game, I don't know which one does what because I do not care.

772
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:46,969
Speaker 0: Yep, so that's a disappointment on what would otherwise be really, really good, like, you know, top tier.

773
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:55,760
Speaker 0: as far as the toilet multiplayer, like, it's like, has there even been a multiplayer online game, phone or otherwise?

774
01:04:57,262 --> 01:05:03,660
Speaker 1: The only games I can play against another human while I'm pooping on my phone are asynchronous games.

775
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:20,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you could play, you know, for a multiplayer toilet game, right, you could play the other card games like a Hearthstone or a Magic Arena, but it's like, those take a while, that's one, maybe you'll get a match in, maybe not, it could be a long one, right?

776
01:05:20,641 --> 01:05:30,760
Speaker 0: It's like, there is no other real multiplayer online competitive actual strategy game that you can play more than once in a poop, right?

777
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,724
Speaker 0: This is it, right?

778
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:39,940
Speaker 0: And that is very compelling, but not compelling enough for me to grind away my time or money in order to play it properly.

779
01:05:39,980 --> 01:06:07,760
Speaker 0: There's also, as far as I can tell, no competitive organized structure, there's no tournaments, there's no way to say I want to play against my friend Rim and play only against my friend Rim, there's no private lobbies, there's no, you know, way to have a tournament on Twitch, there's nothing, they might add that at some point, but as far as I can tell, none of that exists, you can only just play a game against a rando and then play a game against another rando and that's all you can do.

780
01:06:08,402 --> 01:06:13,120
Speaker 1: I have played four games against randos since the one I lost a little while ago on my phone while we're doing the show.

781
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:21,471
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, if I could have, you know, even Hearthstone lets you play against a specific person in your battle net friends list, right?

782
01:06:21,531 --> 01:06:27,540
Speaker 0: It's like, if that was a thing, then I could have maybe almost gotten into it a little bit more.

783
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:33,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, because if I would just play against- I could have found a Discord server of serious players and played against them.

784
01:06:34,142 --> 01:06:39,780
Speaker 1: Or we could just play amongst, like, our friends and nobody, no one we know- Yeah, everyone has the same cards, right?

785
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:46,400
Speaker 1: They'd be close enough, because nobody we know would grind that much, the grind is exponential, and nobody we know would spend that much money.

786
01:06:48,001 --> 01:07:00,560
Speaker 0: To their credit, I will say that even though you have to grind away with money or time to unlock all these cards, they did not do any loot boxes or boosters or random shit.

787
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:12,460
Speaker 0: You can't sit there, as far as I can see, there might be there that I just didn't see it, I don't think you can buy packs of cards and then, like, disintegrate the doubles to get points and leftover currency.

788
01:07:12,681 --> 01:07:19,020
Speaker 0: Nope, there's none of that randomness, the progression of unlocking cards- That's good, that is good that they don't have that.

789
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:26,719
Speaker 1: It's the same thing New Overwatch did, where in Switch, funnily enough, nerds are complaining about, because they want the loot boxes, they want that randomness to-.

790
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:33,000
Speaker 0: Of course, those nerds are there, because they just like gambling and collecting, they're not interested in actually playing a game.

791
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:39,880
Speaker 1: This is the new design pattern, to get away from the loot boxes, because I think the entire industry sees that that's going to get cracked down on eventually.

792
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:45,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually don't see a problem, it's like, keep all the grindy bullshit you have, right?

793
01:07:45,913 --> 01:07:48,660
Speaker 0: The kid with no money can grind his time away, right?

794
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:54,593
Speaker 0: The person who's mega rich can, you know, who wants all the cosmetics, right?

795
01:07:54,613 --> 01:07:57,420
Speaker 0: They can spend, they can be a whale and spend all the money, right?

796
01:07:58,081 --> 01:08:11,620
Speaker 0: Add just the third option, which is, you don't get any cosmetic bonuses, but you do get every card at the non, the weakest cosmetic level to play with, because you care about playing the game, and it costs a flat fee.

797
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,000
Speaker 0: Just add that one payment option, and I'm installing this game again, right away.

798
01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:26,540
Speaker 0: But it's not there, so you're going to have to decide for yourself, you know, how much, if at all, you're going to engage with this game.

799
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:41,240
Speaker 1: I would say it is worth playing up until you get bored with it, or you hit silver rank and then quit, because, one, I want you to see how this game ramps on board a new player with the scripted events and the bots.

800
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,720
Speaker 0: There's a lot of good design in here.

801
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:50,814
Speaker 1: That is brilliantly designed, and two, I want you to see how the game functions, because this is a model to steal.

802
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:53,700
Speaker 1: We are entering the era of a million battle line clones.

803
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,026
Speaker 0: And the user interface is S tier as well, right?

804
01:08:57,167 --> 01:09:01,959
Speaker 0: Except for the menus full of their currency, buying crap, but all the gameplay parts are good interfaces.

805
01:09:01,959 --> 01:09:06,979
Speaker 1: 90% of the menu is just to trick kids into putting real money into the machine.

806
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,582
Speaker 0: Yep.

807
01:09:10,582 --> 01:09:24,020
Speaker 0: So yeah, I would recommend, if you enjoy this game, when you stop playing it, because it's a grind, going out and playing shot and totten, battle line, warhammer invasion, if you can find someone to play that with you.

808
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:32,800
Speaker 1: I would even say, even though it's adjacent, it's not the same kind of game, but it shares many characteristics with these games, lost cities.

809
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,063
Speaker 0: Similar-ish.

810
01:09:35,363 --> 01:09:36,087
Speaker 1: I guess that's Jason.

811
01:09:36,107 --> 01:09:37,292
Speaker 1: It shares many characteristics.

812
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:39,158
Speaker 0: It's also a Rainier Canisia, right?

813
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:41,803
Speaker 1: That Rainier Canisia.

814
01:09:41,903 --> 01:09:49,700
Speaker 0: If you think about it, all those FPSs where you're trying to control different points are somewhat in the same category.

815
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:52,024
Speaker 0: And you can also go to the Colonel Blottos, right?

816
01:09:52,066 --> 01:09:57,240
Speaker 0: You can play, we've done Geek Nights episodes about El Grande and, what's it called, the Rumble one?

817
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,363
Speaker 1: Oh, Rumble Nation?

818
01:09:58,904 --> 01:09:59,987
Speaker 1: Rumble Kingdom?

819
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:00,949
Speaker 1: I think it's Rumble Nation.

820
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:02,634
Speaker 1: I already forgot the name of it.

821
01:10:02,874 --> 01:10:05,040
Speaker 1: I assume it came out and I can buy it by now.

822
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:07,445
Speaker 0: The Japan one.

823
01:10:08,086 --> 01:10:13,160
Speaker 0: Any Colonel Blotto game is just a non-linear, more complex version of this, right?

824
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,399
Speaker 0: Putting cubes in places and winning the most places.

825
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:16,661
Speaker 0: What?

826
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:18,074
Speaker 1: Is it still not released in the US?

827
01:10:18,174 --> 01:10:18,760
Speaker 1: Imports only?

828
01:10:20,185 --> 01:10:20,678
Speaker 0: Oh, good luck.

829
01:10:21,082 --> 01:10:22,720
Speaker 1: It's only like $35 from Hobby Japan.

830
01:10:24,022 --> 01:10:24,606
Speaker 0: Make one.

831
01:10:24,908 --> 01:10:25,794
Speaker 0: It's not a hard game to make.

832
01:10:25,814 --> 01:10:26,580
Speaker 0: You just need some dice.

833
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:29,898
Speaker 1: I think I might just buy the Japanese one.

834
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:31,762
Speaker 0: Marvel Snap.

835
01:10:31,842 --> 01:10:37,820
Speaker 0: An impressive, impressive game that does a lot of things right, but does a critical thing wrong to keep me personally from playing it more.

836
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,140
Speaker 1: If you want to blame anyone for that, blame capitalism.

837
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:48,960
Speaker 0: But still an excellent thing that is quite unique in this world and I applaud it, even though I won't play it.

838
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:55,707
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

839
01:10:55,747 --> 01:11:00,760
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

840
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:06,120

841
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:09,087
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

842
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:13,820
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

844
01:11:18,581 --> 01:11:21,691
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

845
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:24,780
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

846
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:55,180
Speaker 1: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are... ...York University, York University Station, and a bunch of people who are paying a smaller amount because they do not want or need me to say their names.

847
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,991
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty much done with Twitter.

848
01:11:58,051 --> 01:11:59,799
Speaker 1: Scott is mostly done with Twitter too.

849
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:05,020
Speaker 1: But if you're hearing these words, you already know how to find us.

850
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:09,520
Speaker 1: And you probably already have a good idea of what our opinions are on anything in particular.

851
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,760
Speaker 1: So I think you can live without us tweeting for a little while while we sort this out.

852
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:20,587
Speaker 1: But anyway, for tonight, I leave you with...

853
01:12:23,191 --> 01:12:28,770
Speaker 0: So, come up to the lab and see what's on the slab.

854
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:32,749
Speaker 0: I see you shiver with antici...
