1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,176
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Wednesday, May 12th.

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:12,058
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:16,910
Speaker 1: I'm sky, and this is geek nights tonight anime that Scott fell asleep watching.

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,227
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:31,660
Speaker 0: I don't know if I discussed this, but I ordered a new laptop because the one I have I mean it's awesome.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,625
Speaker 0: It has served me well.

7
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,800
Speaker 0: It's still pretty great, but you know it's kind of old core solo.

8
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:38,458
Speaker 0: I guess it's more Monday stuff, but whatever the point is already a new one.

9
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:49,040
Speaker 0: and I also ordered of course an extra power adapter and a little you know a zipper Sleeve to put it in like you do and So Lenovo is totally a cock tease.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:57,700
Speaker 0: They haven't finished putting together the laptop yet because I you know I customized all the parts got the SSD and everything But they shipped me the sleeve and the extra power adapter.

11
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:58,718
Speaker 0: They showed up today at work.

12
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:03,560
Speaker 0: So you know that's cool because I won't have to worry about signing it for signing for it when I'm not at home.

13
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:06,927
Speaker 0: but The thing is right.

14
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:09,240
Speaker 0: I take the sleeve and I put it in my laptop bag.

15
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:17,697
Speaker 0: It sort of sticks out about a couple inches You know because this thing is like a 10.2 inch sort of widescreen, but the one the laptop.

16
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:20,910
Speaker 0: I got is like a 12 inch Squarish screen.

17
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:21,940
Speaker 1: see that's the trouble.

18
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:28,615
Speaker 1: It's like it's an ultra portable technically But it's still bigger than like the tiny tiny laptops that we really like.

19
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,853
Speaker 1: you know what I want is I'm willing to pay for it a crazy powerful laptop.

20
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:34,200
Speaker 1: That is the size of a netbook.

21
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:37,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is right, so what am I gonna do about this bag?

22
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,704
Speaker 0: I can't get a new bag.

23
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:42,720
Speaker 1: this bag is like the awesome, but you could get the bigger version of that bag.

24
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,820
Speaker 0: That's too big and I'm not gonna replace this bag.

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,386
Speaker 1: I gotta find some other bag.

26
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:51,039
Speaker 1: gotta find some other custom place that makes bags and get them to make like.

27
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:59,125
Speaker 0: I Don't want to get another custom bag to replace my expensive custom bag that is in perfect working or you can go ultra custom find Like a tailor.

28
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:05,776
Speaker 1: you know someone who makes bags and be like look I want you to make me a bag for me to carry this list of items.

29
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:06,660
Speaker 1: here are the items.

30
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:11,280
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, you know spend like a thousand dollars and get like the perfect, okay?

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,303
Speaker 0: And then what happens?

32
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:16,660
Speaker 0: why I get another laptop a few years or now you have money and you do the whole thing again.

33
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:24,125
Speaker 0: No, I'm not buying a new bag Another laptop yeah anyway So that that was your day.

34
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:24,848
Speaker 1: that was your exciting.

35
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:26,916
Speaker 0: that was just annoying that I put this.

36
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:30,505
Speaker 0: you know I'm like ah fuck I can't close my bag all the way really sorta.

37
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:35,795
Speaker 1: yep, not really a to our Wednesday thing either, but I Just bought an Xbox.

38
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:36,737
Speaker 0: all right.

39
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,783
Speaker 0: basically watch some animes on it.

40
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:41,030
Speaker 1: I guess it's a Street Fighter 4 machine.

41
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:42,395
Speaker 0: No, there's some other stuff.

42
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:43,520
Speaker 0: We'll play some Tecmo Bowl.

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,403
Speaker 1: We will we will.

44
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:46,090
Speaker 0: we can play Castle Crashers remote.

45
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:48,690
Speaker 1: I mean my policy is still going to be anytime.

46
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,910
Speaker 1: There's a game that I could get on the Xbox that I could also get on the PC.

47
00:02:54,572 --> 00:03:00,147
Speaker 1: And if I don't care about not being able to play with Xbox people on the PC PC 100% really see.

48
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:01,210
Speaker 0: my policy is similar.

49
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,002
Speaker 0: However my policy is this I will get the game for Xbox if it is a game I want to play with controllers on the TV.

50
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:09,069
Speaker 0: I will get the game on the PC.

51
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:09,708
Speaker 0: What's the game?

52
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,176
Speaker 0: I want to play with the mouse and a keyboard.

53
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:16,889
Speaker 1: the thing is if I get even if I get a game on the PC I'm gonna have an HD PC That's fast enough to play my steam games.

54
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:18,540
Speaker 1: And I got a USB.

55
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,136
Speaker 0: my h2 thing is the HD PC I have is you know fast enough.

56
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,380
Speaker 0: the thing is right.

57
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,141
Speaker 0: take this for example, okay, so Street Fighter 4 right yeah the home theater BC can totally do it.

58
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:35,266
Speaker 0: the thing is is The home theater PC wants to do a vertical sync at 1080, but you know 1080p at 60 Hertz.

59
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:44,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, right the Xbox to the 1080p doesn't do 60 Hertz But it vertical sinks at a lower hurt.

60
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:45,142
Speaker 0: right.

61
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:48,106
Speaker 1: so just get a more powerful HD PC.

62
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:50,916
Speaker 0: No The thing is the HD PC right.

63
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:56,289
Speaker 0: the graphics that it makes it 60 Hertz are way better than the ones the 360 makes cuz It's so much more powerful.

64
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:00,002
Speaker 0: But I can't get it to vertical sync at a lower hurt cuz.

65
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:04,569
Speaker 0: then I had to get the TV to go to a lower You know vertical refresh rate, and that doesn't happen.

66
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:08,074
Speaker 1: I'm sure you come up with something But I guess I saw.

67
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:14,925
Speaker 0: the problem is is that it looks better when I play Street Fighter 4 on the PC But it gets a little bit air because there's no vertical sync.

68
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:15,969
Speaker 0: and you get the scan line.

69
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,377
Speaker 0: well I think the operative, but if I plan the 360 is just perfect But the graphics are less quality.

70
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:27,848
Speaker 1: the operative point there is just that with an HD PC There's a little more fiddling involved in everything and you'll never get it just working like an Xbox will.

71
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:28,210
Speaker 1: yeah.

72
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:38,329
Speaker 0: The other thing is that most of the games that I can play on the TV right with the Xbox the multiplayer action is gonna Be on Xbox Live and not as much on games for Windows Live.

73
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,584
Speaker 1: yeah However, you're not gonna play a Civ 5 on an Xbox.

74
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:44,530
Speaker 1: if you'll even be on I don't think it'll be on the Xbox.

75
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,294
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

76
00:04:45,314 --> 00:04:47,605
Speaker 1: Yeah supreme commanders on there.

77
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,610
Speaker 1: I can't imagine how that works.

78
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:53,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would never buy that for like Left 4 Dead it always all my co-workers have Left 4 Dead.

79
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,215
Speaker 1: I would have played with them.

80
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:55,743
Speaker 1: They all have it on the Xbox.

81
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:56,326
Speaker 1: What's the fuck?

82
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:56,909
Speaker 0: I don't know.

83
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:59,228
Speaker 1: I don't know I I just can't imagine that.

84
00:04:59,952 --> 00:05:04,910
Speaker 1: But it's Wednesday, and we're not gonna review it yet because obviously it's still coming out.

85
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,817
Speaker 1: But I'm watching the door our.

86
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:08,804
Speaker 1: uh it's pretty fucking awesome.

87
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:09,426
Speaker 1: It's all right.

88
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:10,390
Speaker 1: I've kind of blown.

89
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,019
Speaker 0: I think I finished watching Captain Harlock.

90
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:18,748
Speaker 0: I'm now watching that 13 episode Co-production with PBS the Phoenix.

91
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,673
Speaker 0: Oh Jessica Phoenix.

92
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:21,637
Speaker 0: yeah, I forgot.

93
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:22,620
Speaker 0: you know I just didn't watch it.

94
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:23,705
Speaker 0: when it's I'm watching it now.

95
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:25,110
Speaker 1: that had a good opener.

96
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,423
Speaker 1: I recall like I like the opener.

97
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:28,352
Speaker 0: yeah That's it.

98
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:28,814
Speaker 1: Yeah.

99
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,140
Speaker 1: I don't know Dora.

100
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:36,430
Speaker 1: We'll do a show on it as soon as it's all out because Obviously, there's some sort of twist coming at the end like some big things gonna happen.

101
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,659
Speaker 0: Watch nothing happens.

102
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just kind of stops.

103
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:41,633
Speaker 0: That'd be cool.

104
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:42,899
Speaker 1: I don't know it.

105
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,823
Speaker 1: You were right though.

106
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,470
Speaker 1: one Scott predicted something.

107
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,009
Speaker 1: We're not gonna spoil anything that I did not predict.

108
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:53,545
Speaker 1: I Realized it probably like I don't know two minutes before in the course of the show.

109
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:54,729
Speaker 1: it was revealed straight up.

110
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,885
Speaker 0: I did it in like episode two.

111
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:59,160
Speaker 1: yeah That was one of those meta predictions.

112
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,427
Speaker 1: like me and Alex's D&D games He introduces the character, and I'm like that guy's clearly the whole villain for this whole campaign.

113
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:09,770
Speaker 1: Alex wrote No, no, but there is some news.

114
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:14,305
Speaker 1: Scott's gonna tell me that this is old news because he knew about it, but I didn't know.

115
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:22,959
Speaker 1: I don't pay attention to Philly Wizard world or well, I guess star wizard world basically wizard world right is a you know wizard magazine Which is right?

116
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:28,930
Speaker 0: They like they had some conventions and they reworked them and they rescheduled them.

117
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,130
Speaker 0: No,

118
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:45,630
Speaker 1: no wizard world conventions are comic conventions in the older school sense so they seem to be trying to Appeal to the demographic that goes to like SDCC in that they bring like movie actors and kind of all these Ancillary pop culture things just trying to get a bunch of bodies there.

119
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:54,821
Speaker 1: But the majority of the bodies there other than those kind of pop culture people who get sucked in are Dudes looking for silver age fucking spider-man, and that is all they want.

120
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:59,860
Speaker 1: they got the little rolly-wheelie bag filled with all I remember looking for the new Green Lantern.

121
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,890
Speaker 0: ish shit that they love those nodes.

122
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,394
Speaker 1: But the same kind of people.

123
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:06,564
Speaker 1: they're going primarily to buy comics and pay for autographs.

124
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:18,382
Speaker 0: Yep, so anyway the These conventions like they've kept reworking them and moving them and they close some in some cities and opened up in other cities and Whatever and they keep doing a whole bunch of stuff.

125
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:33,710
Speaker 0: and basically their new strategy Which well, it's just not so new rim Just discovered it recently is that they basically when there's a big comic convention in town They have their comic convention at the same day same weekend as the big one and their logic is okay.

126
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,939
Speaker 0: If we just have our Scott.

127
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:36,470
Speaker 1: we're talking about comic cons.

128
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,920
Speaker 1: You could have said same bat time same bat play okay, whatever.

129
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:43,350
Speaker 0: so you could have their their strategy here, right?

130
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,734
Speaker 0: You think that's a stupid strategy.

131
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:46,139
Speaker 0: who's gonna go to their convention?

132
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,102
Speaker 0: right if there's another better bigger one in town and the thing is Okay, so let's say the newer comic-con right.

133
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:56,180
Speaker 0: a ton of people show up for that shit Especially since it's now combined with the New York Anime Festival.

134
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,168
Speaker 0: It is a mega double con alrighty.

135
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:04,751
Speaker 0: So now if they just had it on their own weekend in New York some people would show up Maybe.

136
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:09,508
Speaker 0: but if they have it on that weekend that bigger convention is is so big.

137
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,661
Speaker 0: It's drawing people from a wider geographical area to come into New York.

138
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:23,270
Speaker 0: those people wouldn't come into New York from Massachusetts Or Pennsylvania for the wizard con especially because there's a wizard con probably near them at some other point in maybe.

139
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:26,950
Speaker 0: But even if not it's not a big enough con to draw from such a large area.

140
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:34,169
Speaker 0: It pretty much only draw the Manhattan nerds right so or the New York City nerds And maybe a slight maybe some northern Jersey nerds too, right?

141
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:54,467
Speaker 0: But if this is bigger con in town that draws this big geographical area worth of people into the city and there happens to be Another nerd con down the road that is within you know ten five ten minute walking distance They're hoping that they can actually get more people to come to their con than would otherwise Because the mega nerds will go to both cons.

142
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:59,328
Speaker 0: now They get a few key like guests to go to their con instead of the New York comic-con or whatever.

143
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:02,825
Speaker 0: the other Con in town happens to be in the other city that they're doing this in.

144
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:09,308
Speaker 0: and You know I just got to go see this guest, so I'll go buy a badge to the other con also.

145
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:15,068
Speaker 1: now I don't see this working so well at least in this New York situation because one I know we couldn't figure out.

146
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,196
Speaker 1: I actually look In the map to see where the hell this thing was.

147
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,273
Speaker 1: the only convention center in New York City is the Javits Which is not.

148
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:22,358
Speaker 1: it's big.

149
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:29,890
Speaker 1: like it's one of those convention centers that can only be used for Gigantic gigantic events and like it's the kind of thing that like the New York Auto Show is in there.

150
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:36,130
Speaker 1: You know giant show floors Tens and tens and tens and thousands of people hundreds of thousands of people over the course of a weekend.

151
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,647
Speaker 1: You know big iron big deal stuff.

152
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,136
Speaker 1: Where the hell are they gonna have their comic-con?

153
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:44,030
Speaker 1: and apparently they're like 20 blocks north of the Javits.

154
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:48,401
Speaker 0: I thought they were like 10 15 blocks Depends on where you count the Javits.

155
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,498
Speaker 1: the Javits span as many blocks But it is at like 50 something.

156
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:56,370
Speaker 1: it's Street at Pier F uptown which isn't that far.

157
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,836
Speaker 1: It's probably like a 20-minute walk.

158
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:00,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like there's no crosstown action.

159
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:01,110
Speaker 0: It's just straight north base.

160
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,652
Speaker 1: However, it's straight north through an area of Manhattan that for those of you who aren't from New York It's basically empty.

161
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:12,190
Speaker 1: there aren't even hobos out there, nor are there pigeons because there's nothing for the pigeons.

162
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,917
Speaker 0: It's basically just a concrete walk.

163
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:15,081
Speaker 1: There's nothing.

164
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:15,945
Speaker 1: There's no transit.

165
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:17,310
Speaker 0: You're lucky if there's a street vendor.

166
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,670
Speaker 0: There's usually one outside the Javits.

167
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:23,202
Speaker 0: So anime con goers generally more energetic, you know running around.

168
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,575
Speaker 0: They're not going to the wizard con.

169
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:29,122
Speaker 1: They're not going anywhere near that thing.

170
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:30,730
Speaker 1: There's probably nothing in the world.

171
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,517
Speaker 0: They might go up there.

172
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:37,883
Speaker 0: They want to see up there comic nerd guys one at least demographically.

173
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,330
Speaker 1: I don't think have that much money.

174
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,726
Speaker 1: I don't know if they're gonna pay 50 bucks to get into two conventions.

175
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:47,030
Speaker 0: It's weird I think that there's like a huge spread in terms of how much money the common people have right?

176
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,195
Speaker 0: It's like you get some people.

177
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:51,330
Speaker 0: it's like they love comics so much, but they have a very little money.

178
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:54,470
Speaker 0: So every month they just buy spider-man for like four bucks and that's it.

179
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:58,968
Speaker 0: And then there's the guys who are like his 20 G's give me that silver server number one.

180
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:01,303
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Oh shit, the quality is not high enough.

181
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:02,249
Speaker 0: I need to trade up.

182
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:10,030
Speaker 0: I will sell you this silver server number one and give you five thousand dollars for that mint or condition silver server number one.

183
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,097
Speaker 0: Those guys those guys exist, right?

184
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:19,760
Speaker 0: So the thing is I will pay $500 for my con badge, so it's a VIP badge so I can skip all the lines.

185
00:11:20,021 --> 00:11:22,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, they I think they both have that sort of stuff going on.

186
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,739
Speaker 1: but yeah, the tricky part is without transit short of taking a cab.

187
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:31,488
Speaker 1: a Stereotypical comic book guy now there are exceptions is fat.

188
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:38,618
Speaker 1: a stereotypical one might be carrying a lot of comic books is not gonna make it To that other con let alone back.

189
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:44,880
Speaker 0: They might do one site name, you know, these people are just the kind of people were diving in the bins to buy stuff.

190
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:48,340
Speaker 0: They're not going to the panels, you know, they're not doing all the other stuff, right?

191
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,585
Speaker 0: They go to one.

192
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,980
Speaker 0: they hit up all the bins sad Friday.

193
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,623
Speaker 0: They go to the other.

194
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,651
Speaker 0: one hit all the bins Saturday and they go home.

195
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:58,246
Speaker 0: then maybe they hit them both on Sunday You know, maybe they go home.

196
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:08,660
Speaker 1: Who knows see now if that if Wizard World were smart I don't want to give them good ideas because I'll be pretty much straight up, you know We're in the New York comic-con New York anime festival camp at this point.

197
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,603
Speaker 1: We're gonna be there at both, you know same day and everything doing a bunch of panels all the kind of stuff We usually do.

198
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:16,051
Speaker 1: it's read expositions.

199
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:19,237
Speaker 1: We work with them on stuff positions expositions.

200
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:28,945
Speaker 1: So we're not going anywhere near Wizard World and I guess unless they let us in free and they send us a car or something I don't know.

201
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:30,574
Speaker 0: Why would I go there if I were them?

202
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:41,330
Speaker 1: I Would set up and pay for a shuttle and I'd get a dealer's table at the read-con and Basically be like but they could refuse to give them the table.

203
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,226
Speaker 1: they could I don't know if they would and also the Javits Unions law rules.

204
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:49,120
Speaker 0: They might not be allowed to have a shuttle to go to a competing event like that.

205
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:52,495
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would set the shuttle up, you know on the public street right there.

206
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:53,600
Speaker 1: You can do that with New York City.

207
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:57,780
Speaker 1: I guess I would set something up have a shuttle back and forth all day.

208
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,306
Speaker 0: You could probably rent the Chinatown bus.

209
00:12:59,326 --> 00:12:59,848
Speaker 0: make them do it.

210
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:05,780
Speaker 1: and what I would do is I would offer to You know Nick Niaf, they probably wouldn't accept it.

211
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,663
Speaker 1: But then I would just do it.

212
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:13,332
Speaker 1: anyone my own anyone who comes to my con wizard con with a New York anime festival comic-con Badge gets 50% off the badge.

213
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,806
Speaker 1: Hey, yeah, that's what I would do.

214
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:21,360
Speaker 0: You basically making your it's like hey, we'll make a you know leech con.

215
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:23,670
Speaker 0: It's like well, there's nothing this beat.

216
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,119
Speaker 0: Let's just make a leech event.

217
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:36,200
Speaker 0: It's like if there's a music concert and I have a concert that has nothing to do with them an hour before that Concert starts and I say if you got tickets to the big concert you can get into my concert for a dollar.

218
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:46,940
Speaker 1: You know, what's funny is that this is the sort of thing that Unnamed staff at certain anime conventions we work with will say, you know Reed they always say yeah Reed's trying to destroy us.

219
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:50,452
Speaker 1: They always try to like steal all our stuff and steal our secrets.

220
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:52,860
Speaker 1: that the how to run, you know, poorly managed cons.

221
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:54,525
Speaker 0: But yeah, they want your secret.

222
00:13:54,545 --> 00:14:00,160
Speaker 1: so bad the anime con staff are so afraid of Reed and yet Reed doesn't do the shady stuff.

223
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:01,719
Speaker 1: It's wizard world doing the shade.

224
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:04,592
Speaker 0: But wizard world is not something to be afraid of now.

225
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:08,068
Speaker 1: because we went to Philly wizard world Let me tell you many years ago.

226
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:12,888
Speaker 1: I walked around trying to interview people at that thing and It was amazing.

227
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:16,644
Speaker 1: one people were afraid of the microphone like, you know I or even without the microphone.

228
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:20,880
Speaker 1: it started hiding it because when I headed out or my press badge people would like stay away from.

229
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:33,184
Speaker 1: But if I hit it and I just talked to a random person They seemed aghast that I had said anything to them and the only person who consented to be interviewed Basically talked at length about how they were there to buy Silver Age spider-man.

230
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,592
Speaker 1: they had a list of silver age spider-man comics they needed.

231
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,347
Speaker 1: they spent all day looking for them and then they went home.

232
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:39,284
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

233
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:52,192
Speaker 1: It's a different experience But yeah I'll take this opportunity to to point out that the New York anime festival comic-con is October 7th 8th and 9th Or sorry 8th 9th and 10th in New York City.

234
00:14:52,453 --> 00:14:54,720
Speaker 1: Manhattan will be there if you want to see us.

235
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:02,907
Speaker 1: We'll be doing awesome stuff And now that we live in the city We will probably be able to hang out pretty late and not you know Any of you tried to see.

236
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:08,215
Speaker 1: it's the New York anime festival last year might have remembered that We appeared did our panels and then like the wind.

237
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,687
Speaker 1: Yep None of that anymore.

238
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:11,895
Speaker 1: We're gonna be there all three days.

239
00:15:12,257 --> 00:15:16,480
Speaker 1: Yep Okay, so how's that anime industry doing?

240
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:21,579
Speaker 0: Oh, it's doing just as well as it's always been doing for the past X years, which is horribly bad.

241
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,120
Speaker 0: So what was it like 2002 when the anime boom was like, so this isn't animated is manga related?

242
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,888
Speaker 0: So Viz has laid off 60 people.

243
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:30,831
Speaker 0: they closed their knee.

244
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:33,620
Speaker 0: They closed their New York branch, which is five people.

245
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:40,200
Speaker 0: They laid off 55 people at their headquarters in San Francisco, and we've determined that they have 90 people remaining.

246
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:44,016
Speaker 0: Right, so actually that's pretty impressive to have 90 people, right?

247
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:44,860
Speaker 0: That's a lot of people.

248
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:46,890
Speaker 1: What do they need those 90 people for?

249
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:47,735
Speaker 1: is what I wonder?

250
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:51,500
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean well I mean Viz does publish a lot of stuff, you know.

251
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:54,860
Speaker 0: And they said ahem and this is from the animated news network.

252
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:58,780
Speaker 0: Obviously be assured Viz media remains connected to its obligations to you.

253
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,514
Speaker 0: They have no plans this time for drastic measures such as product cancellations or business line closures.

254
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,420
Speaker 0: your favorite series are not going away.

255
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:09,660
Speaker 0: So as long as they finish like 20th century boys in Bocorano, it's all good, right?

256
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:12,020
Speaker 0: I mean you reading anything else from Viz?

257
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:20,140
Speaker 1: What's so sad is that four kids reported I think 3.5 million dollars in losses.

258
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:20,864
Speaker 0: Well, that's a good.

259
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:25,948
Speaker 0: four kids mostly made their money by getting shows like, you know One piece of whatever get out on TV and butchering.

260
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:27,754
Speaker 0: nobody's putting them on TV anymore.

261
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:29,460
Speaker 0: So, of course, why did four kids?

262
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,027
Speaker 0: I'm surprised they're still in business.

263
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:32,735
Speaker 0: I know but what business are they doing?

264
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:33,539
Speaker 1: What amazes me is?

265
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,928
Speaker 1: All right, 3.5 million dollars in losses.

266
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:38,197
Speaker 1: the fuck are they doing with 3.5 million dollars?

267
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:43,172
Speaker 1: I could have made an entire company and put out an anime.

268
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, what are they spending that money on?

269
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:52,000
Speaker 1: I mean Well, they apparently they got 12 properties now and they're how many of those are on TV?

270
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:56,568
Speaker 1: They're gonna put them all on TV They have a new TV block and they're basically spending all this money.

271
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:02,324
Speaker 1: for here's my non educated non insider personal opinion Not based on anything.

272
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:03,648
Speaker 1: I have a no secret or whatever.

273
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:07,900
Speaker 1: I think four kids is gonna have this last gasp and then they're gone.

274
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:10,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean wasn't someone gonna buy them or something?

275
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:17,060
Speaker 1: They said recently that they have a buyer possibly lined up or that someone expressed interest in buying them.

276
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:19,054
Speaker 1: I think they're on the way out.

277
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:19,618
Speaker 1: I think they're done.

278
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:20,828
Speaker 0: Well, what?

279
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:21,252
Speaker 0: what are?

280
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:21,997
Speaker 0: if I you know?

281
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:29,240
Speaker 0: I mean if I just had that the money that they lost which means that they had it and spent it right because you can't Have a loss if you didn't have the money to begin with, right?

282
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:39,247
Speaker 0: So if I had three and a half million dollars and my and I had to basically be in the anime business I could buy one anime that was guaranteed to be a hit market.

283
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:44,693
Speaker 0: it make it a hit and Make a profit and then I would just repeat over and over again.

284
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:46,780
Speaker 0: And I how could I fail at that?

285
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,431
Speaker 0: I know what shows are gonna be a hit.

286
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:48,975
Speaker 1: Also.

287
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:49,720
Speaker 1: Look at those three.

288
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,906
Speaker 0: I would just buy Dora.

289
00:17:50,986 --> 00:18:06,710
Speaker 1: I win if I was running one of these, you know anime companies or manga companies which I still believe the main reason there are so many problems in this so-called industry is that By and large everyone involved in it is just terribly unprofessional Like surprisingly so.

290
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,960
Speaker 1: but why do they need all these employees?

291
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:23,307
Speaker 1: I would have the tiniest footprint ever and I would literally outsource everything, you know I'd have a shell company a couple of employees You know doing sales and all the kind of basic stuff and every time we wanted a new property We'd get it and then I would basically Contract people to translate.

292
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:25,576
Speaker 1: if I needed to dub I'd contract people to dub.

293
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:26,500
Speaker 1: it would be nothing.

294
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,407
Speaker 0: Well, if you're five your viz right.

295
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,415
Speaker 0: so viz 90 people that's what we're talking about.

296
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:32,342
Speaker 0: Yeah, so viz does manga Okay.

297
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:37,260
Speaker 0: So first I basically need someone to go and get the licenses to things.

298
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,540
Speaker 0: But this doesn't need that because viz basically has a lock on the licenses.

299
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,517
Speaker 1: You needed that get like, you know a 10 person team plus a lawyer and that's it.

300
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:45,240
Speaker 0: All right.

301
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,567
Speaker 0: So, okay, so you get the licenses which viz already has.

302
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:55,031
Speaker 0: Yeah, you need translating you need printing you need Marketing and then you need to actually everything but marketing.

303
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,820
Speaker 1: you can just contract out every time you have a new property.

304
00:18:58,122 --> 00:18:59,631
Speaker 1: There's no reason keeping people around.

305
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,160
Speaker 0: quality doesn't matter.

306
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,096
Speaker 0: the only thing you need quality on is like the the book cover designs and stuff like that.

307
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:09,385
Speaker 0: so you hire what like one or two awesome designers and Everything else like.

308
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:10,108
Speaker 0: okay.

309
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:13,180
Speaker 0: Yes that you you should have high quality translations.

310
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,599
Speaker 0: You're gonna sell the same number with or without let's be honest here, right?

311
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,487
Speaker 0: And even the translations good enough.

312
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:19,109
Speaker 0: small staff.

313
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:29,908
Speaker 1: you keep like what like a head of translations you basically keep one or two awesome people for each division or each like part of the business process and They're the ones who oversee the contract.

314
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:32,458
Speaker 0: you have like one HR person who's also the office manager.

315
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:35,113
Speaker 0: Yep, and What I mean, what do you need?

316
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:35,820
Speaker 0: an accountant?

317
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:40,617
Speaker 0: You know, I guess you could probably run it with less than 20 people.

318
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:41,473
Speaker 0: the whole thing I think.

319
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:47,489
Speaker 0: so I think easily so and outsource everything else for wicked cheap like, you know You wouldn't get some interns up ends.

320
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:53,940
Speaker 1: You might not necessarily be super profitable But I think you could have a business that may make more money than they're making because you have less employees.

321
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,892
Speaker 0: 3.5 million dollars Kids is the one with three and a half million dollars.

322
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:00,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, my biz you're getting a mixed up here.

323
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,603
Speaker 0: You can't be doing that.

324
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:03,269
Speaker 1: how much money is making though?

325
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,031
Speaker 0: We don't know.

326
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:05,476
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the other problem.

327
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:06,560
Speaker 1: None of these companies are public.

328
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know, that's how it is.

329
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,898
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

330
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:20,200
Speaker 1: What do you got for me Scott?

331
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,050
Speaker 0: It's basically it's just this funky animation called love and theft.

332
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:30,890
Speaker 0: It's seven minutes long and it's just so Frickin funky and awesome and you should watch it.

333
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:37,773
Speaker 0: probably it's it's a. it's like a much better thing if you watch it like full screen or Like on your TV full screen or something.

334
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:42,451
Speaker 0: just because the way it is If you watch it in a little YouTube window, it won't be as quite as cool.

335
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:44,858
Speaker 0: So it's just an animation.

336
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,069
Speaker 0: It's fun I like it.

337
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:47,737
Speaker 0: That's it.

338
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:52,720
Speaker 1: Well, I'm glad you have something good because this isn't the best thing in the world.

339
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,511
Speaker 1: but I think it's cool because I would actually like to see this.

340
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,519
Speaker 1: just for the sense of scale.

341
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:13,812
Speaker 1: a life-size bust of Ava zero one was made in Japan or is in the process of being made some amusement park near Mount Fuji and it's basically that scene where Shinji, you know sees Ava one for the first time and It's life-size, but only the top of it and I don't know.

342
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:14,757
Speaker 1: I think that's pretty cool.

343
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:15,420
Speaker 0: That's all right.

344
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,168
Speaker 0: There's a big thing going on over there.

345
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:18,971
Speaker 0: It's like it's weird.

346
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,000
Speaker 0: It's like they can't get people to watch.

347
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:24,349
Speaker 0: You know, it wasn't like Mike tool talking about this anime Boston.

348
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:25,011
Speaker 0: how like.

349
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:28,060
Speaker 0: they can't get people to like, you know watch animes.

350
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:31,604
Speaker 0: But then again, there's like this huge Nostalgia, right?

351
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,980
Speaker 0: So when they make a big life-size Gundam statue like a zillion people show up.

352
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:42,898
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they build stuff about nobody goes to on TV to watch anything, you know, I don't know of course Is it not the same way in America?

353
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:43,080
Speaker 1: look?

354
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,880
Speaker 1: 26,000 nerds will go to Otakon including us and have an awesome time, but none of those people buy or watch.

355
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,369
Speaker 0: General public goes to see the giant Gundam robot.

356
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:59,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the same general public that might have memories of Gundam But they're not watching new Gundam double-o, right?

357
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:01,656
Speaker 1: Of course Gundam double-o wasn't that good.

358
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:02,198
Speaker 0: I don't know.

359
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:02,800
Speaker 0: I didn't watch it.

360
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,907
Speaker 1: I watched the first one episode.

361
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:05,650
Speaker 1: I wasn't impressed.

362
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,420
Speaker 0: I mean the thing is I watched the first one episode and it was Gundam.

363
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:12,300
Speaker 1: I mean it was yeah, well, it's tricky because the first four episodes of any Gundam are the same thing.

364
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:19,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, so before we get on to the main bit We got the meta moment that we forget to do every now and then.

365
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:25,600
Speaker 1: but we're remembering now quite often book club is still cosmos The coding club is still project Dorf and I imagine will be for a while.

366
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:28,092
Speaker 1: We're gonna be at the New York Comic Con New York Anime Festival.

367
00:22:28,112 --> 00:22:31,560
Speaker 1: We're gonna be at PAX East PAX West Connecticut, yep, Connecticut.

368
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,977
Speaker 1: Okay, not much else going on right now.

369
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:39,053
Speaker 0: That's all I got.

370
00:22:39,073 --> 00:22:41,241
Speaker 0: That's oh there's that you stream is happening.

371
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:41,763
Speaker 0: All right.

372
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:42,024
Speaker 1: Yeah.

373
00:22:42,104 --> 00:22:43,369
Speaker 1: Well, we should probably talking like this.

374
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:49,616
Speaker 1: second Yeah, we're streaming the video of us doing the show live Mostly as a promotional tool.

375
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:50,941
Speaker 1: I'll tell you straight up reason.

376
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:59,557
Speaker 0: It's a promotional tool is because people who go to you stream Hopefully will you know see Oh geek nights is live now and maybe some new people who don't know about us We'll find us on you stream.

377
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:01,450
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the the idea.

378
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,570
Speaker 1: Yeah It's literally just a camera from a different angle every now and then showing the studio and how we actually record the show.

379
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,939
Speaker 1: So it's a lot like watching Howard Stern.

380
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,763
Speaker 1: He sits there.

381
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:12,007
Speaker 1: There's a microphone in his face.

382
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:14,400
Speaker 1: Yep It's not exciting to watch.

383
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,609
Speaker 1: so I wouldn't necessarily Recommend that you bother with it.

384
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:21,390
Speaker 1: I guess the only thing it really has going is that one there is the chat room.

385
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,167
Speaker 1: So I guess you could talk to other listeners about it if you wanted to.

386
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:28,770
Speaker 0: in real time You also see a few minutes of stuff that doesn't make the show.

387
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:36,187
Speaker 1: So yep, like when we stop recording and do stuff and when we try to figure out what to do the show on Usually get to see what I were to work.

388
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:37,956
Speaker 1: That's exciting.

389
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:45,054
Speaker 1: I guess okay right now You can see the fact that the door on the closet in the studio fell and it's kind of Hang in there.

390
00:23:45,094 --> 00:23:46,763
Speaker 0: Yeah, you pay us so much money for this apartment.

391
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:47,949
Speaker 0: They can't even have doors that work.

392
00:23:48,363 --> 00:23:58,008
Speaker 1: Yeah well the thing is and people in apartments like this from what I can tell actually Tend to take all the fixtures out and put them in storage buy their own fancy fixtures and install them.

393
00:23:58,529 --> 00:23:59,995
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I I'm cheap.

394
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:00,900
Speaker 1: I didn't bother with that.

395
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,829
Speaker 1: So I have the plain white generic fixtures.

396
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,835
Speaker 0: Anyway, yep.

397
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:05,779
Speaker 1: So back to the show.

398
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,970
Speaker 1: We were trying to come up with something to review.

399
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:09,529
Speaker 1: I mean Scott's watching a bunch of anime.

400
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:15,210
Speaker 1: I'm watching a bunch but we haven't both finished in anime together recently and Dora was not done yet.

401
00:24:15,331 --> 00:24:16,618
Speaker 1: So I don't want to talk about it now.

402
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:18,750
Speaker 0: I mean for all I know we don't want to do repeat shows.

403
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,754
Speaker 1: There's a tiny chance.

404
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:20,798
Speaker 1: It's gonna pull a gonzo

405
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:28,471
Speaker 0: maybe but anyway, the thing is is that I said hey We should do a show cuz we watched a ton of anime back in the day, right tons We're

406
00:24:28,492 --> 00:24:30,382
Speaker 1: talking RIT days when we would you

407
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:39,817
Speaker 0: know, you know even older than that, too but I watched a ton of anime back in the day and we really never did shows on most of it because Mostly because we haven't rewatched it.

408
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:41,021
Speaker 0: So we barely remember it.

409
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:43,109
Speaker 0: So there's not that much to say about them.

410
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:50,101
Speaker 0: and at the same time You know we well basically we.

411
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:54,557
Speaker 1: these are shows that we liked back in the day But I forgot that I had watched.

412
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:58,190
Speaker 1: in fact, I forgot they existed because you know, I'm so hard up for anime.

413
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,783
Speaker 1: now I mean, there's good anime like Dora and there's old good stuff.

414
00:25:01,803 --> 00:25:03,490
Speaker 1: I haven't finished yet like Hokuto no Ken.

415
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:09,689
Speaker 1: But while I'm watching all of those I'll totally forget about a show like saber fucking marionette J.

416
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:11,658
Speaker 0: I just remembered it two seconds ago.

417
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:16,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, and don't ask me what I remember about it I remember that it's a show and it exists.

418
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:18,330
Speaker 1: So we didn't know what did the show honor like?

419
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, what anime?

420
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:23,352
Speaker 1: if we both watch maybe we should show on like some anime that we haven't finished yet I don't know.

421
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:28,849
Speaker 1: and then I was thinking about coup and then I thought about anime that we haven't watched in a long time.

422
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:35,452
Speaker 1: and Suddenly, you know when you have a memory and you tug on that little string and suddenly you remember all these things that just weren't In your mind,

423
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:49,386
Speaker 0: so if we only have like one minute worth of stuff to talk about any individual one of these shows Let's just remember a whole bunch of these old shows and then we can Make one show about all of them together because there's no way we're gonna rewatch all these things.

424
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:54,890
Speaker 1: So a disclaimer We may or may not have remembered these shows as being good.

425
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:57,499
Speaker 1: That was a long time ago.

426
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,998
Speaker 1: they may not be good now, in fact I don't remember the characters names from half of these.

427
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:06,754
Speaker 1: I don't remember hardly anything which is scary because some of them I watched Almost all the way through.

428
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's scary.

429
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,530
Speaker 1: Are we gonna be this way with like Hokuto no Ken 20 years from now?

430
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,527
Speaker 1: No, no, no, maybe these shows really weren't that good as a result.

431
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:16,110
Speaker 1: I don't know.

432
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:23,665
Speaker 1: What's weird is some of these shows now that I remember them were Stupidly popular at the anime club back in the RIT days.

433
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:28,464
Speaker 1: like everyone's marathoned him everyone talked about him all the time and I don't remember shit about him.

434
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:37,070
Speaker 0: I Barely, I remember like the barest of details about any of these things But I can still probably talk for each one about each one for a few minutes.

435
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:49,595
Speaker 1: It's almost there's like this curve where a show that is great like you remember forever It's like at the top of your cube and then on the far end shows that are really bad like Odeon are So bad or

436
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:50,940
Speaker 0: that you don't forget them or

437
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,069
Speaker 1: shows like this is the North Star that are so bad and so good Simultaneously that they're better than good.

438
00:26:56,733 --> 00:27:02,601
Speaker 1: Like all those shows are kind of like and around this crater like in the rim They're very high up there and memorable our.

439
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:04,810
Speaker 1: I am like the rim of the crater.

440
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:11,426
Speaker 1: So the rim of job, yeah, that was a clever joke right there you had coming out.

441
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:12,750
Speaker 1: that was fantastic.

442
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:14,538
Speaker 1: I think you could have made a better joke.

443
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,230
Speaker 1: You should have made a goatee joke, you know rims craters of gaping.

444
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:22,316
Speaker 0: It was a slam dunk Dunk.

445
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:23,001
Speaker 1: it's so big.

446
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:23,687
Speaker 0: I broke the rim.

447
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:38,690
Speaker 1: So everything around the rim of this crater is awesome or memorable in some way most Memorable, but then in the middle are all the shows that you watch just because everyone else is watching it.

448
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:45,079
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember this whole era of anime when like I'm trying to remember the Nate like Ravemaster and all that stuff was coming on.

449
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:45,863
Speaker 0: that was later on.

450
00:27:45,923 --> 00:27:48,498
Speaker 0: that was like the Full Metal Panic days Yes, but those like.

451
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,070
Speaker 1: Ravemaster was not a good show but Everyone was watching it.

452
00:27:52,730 --> 00:28:02,290
Speaker 0: Rave master was a kid with a big sword that looked like Final Fantasy 7 and he had this cute monster friend and like the First episode was like hey, there's something going on here and it was a little bit cute and funny.

453
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,421
Speaker 0: So I watched like 10 episodes.

454
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:05,406
Speaker 0: then at a tenth episode.

455
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:06,050
Speaker 0: I was like, huh?

456
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:09,970
Speaker 0: This fight has been going on for seven episodes.

457
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:12,770
Speaker 1: That was back before we could tell that a show was just a fighting.

458
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:18,178
Speaker 0: I didn't even realize it cuz I'm just sitting there watching these short, you know, and I was like, oh shit I got what the fuck is this show?

459
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,826
Speaker 1: I mean Naruto did that to us.

460
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:20,630
Speaker 1: I was like, this is awesome.

461
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,118
Speaker 0: This is four episodes of Naruto.

462
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,225
Speaker 0: awesome ninja school.

463
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:27,170
Speaker 0: This is so hilarious But it took me like most funny ninja school ever.

464
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:35,114
Speaker 0: It took me like ten episodes episode 13 of Naruto that fight against the guy with the big sword Ten episodes.

465
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:39,429
Speaker 0: I've been watching one fight ever since like episode six and done with this.

466
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:43,010
Speaker 1: Yep, so these are not obscure shows.

467
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:52,470
Speaker 1: They're just shows that I don't know if too many people remember and I imagine it would be harder to find some of these Than it would to be finding really old really obscure.

468
00:28:53,937 --> 00:28:55,986
Speaker 0: The difficulty of finding these varies greatly.

469
00:28:56,087 --> 00:29:00,490
Speaker 1: Yes, right We got to start right up though with one that is actually as far as I can tell difficult to find.

470
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,690
Speaker 1: I never actually saw it but coo.

471
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:05,930
Speaker 0: So there's a so in the RIT anime club, right?

472
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:10,008
Speaker 0: They had a library of VHS tapes and we have found that they are in good hands because we met.

473
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:15,164
Speaker 0: the newest Librarian of the RIT anime club at anime bar was an anime Bostoner packs.

474
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:20,013
Speaker 0: It was the same buildings Boston.

475
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:24,708
Speaker 0: so we met him there and you know, we got we figured everything out with him and it's in good hands.

476
00:29:24,748 --> 00:29:25,937
Speaker 0: Scott Johnson no worries.

477
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:37,510
Speaker 0: and Basically, you know he had like me gone through the library and watched some of these old Classic tapes that you know, basically no one knew what the hell they were.

478
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:42,950
Speaker 0: Like you pick up a tape and it says something on it like Horace Prince of Sun and you're like what the fuck is this?

479
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,050
Speaker 1: It says something about the culture of a club like that.

480
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:55,129
Speaker 1: I mean, it's you know I see other anime clubs But I got to say the RIT anime club like the culture was there because as a freshman, you know I'd go up to the library and I'd pick up a weird tape and it says something weird on it like k?

481
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:58,370
Speaker 0: o No one knows what it is, but I look at it.

482
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,030
Speaker 0: But there's no anime news network encyclopedia to look it up either.

483
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:12,948
Speaker 1: but the old guard like the eboard even if they didn't know what a show was and I did this when I was the president like If I saw a kid standing picks up a tape and I have no idea what the show is I'd be like I'd look at him be like, oh you should watch that.

484
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:22,437
Speaker 1: Even if I couldn't see what the tape was and people did that to me all the time I picked up k o century beast and the librarian at the time was like, ah That's an old classic.

485
00:30:22,498 --> 00:30:23,825
Speaker 1: Nobody in this club has seen that.

486
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:24,489
Speaker 1: you should watch it.

487
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,469
Speaker 1: I don't know if you'd seen it or not.

488
00:30:27,232 --> 00:30:32,008
Speaker 0: Okay, so I found it on anime news network, right and it's called ku tui umikara.

489
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:32,610
Speaker 0: Kita ku.

490
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:43,173
Speaker 0: Yes, it's a movie directed by Tetsuo Imazawa, it's from the year 1993.

491
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:45,562
Speaker 1: Wow, like that's newer than I would have guessed.

492
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:47,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

493
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:47,770
Speaker 0: it's hard.

494
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:51,410
Speaker 0: They actually have a screenshot a picture from it, which is kind of amazing.

495
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,273
Speaker 0: And it also seems like.

496
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:58,070
Speaker 0: there's a movie called summer days with ku about like a kid with a kappa named ku.

497
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,600
Speaker 0: I don't know.

498
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,073
Speaker 1: Whoa 2007 movie.

499
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:04,583
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's related to the original in any way whatsoever.

500
00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:06,810
Speaker 1: I think of the entire crew.

501
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,809
Speaker 1: It's funny because you fell asleep through a lot of anime.

502
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:17,050
Speaker 0: Well, because what happened is you'd watch one in like the lounge at night and we'd all be laying You know around watching anime and I would just fall asleep.

503
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,217
Speaker 1: Yep, because I did that a couple of times.

504
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:21,364
Speaker 1: but did you just watch ku by yourself?

505
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:24,775
Speaker 0: because I don't think I watched it by Myself on VHS.

506
00:31:24,855 --> 00:31:28,788
Speaker 1: I did that with all the slayers OAVs back then but basically ku right.

507
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:32,099
Speaker 0: for those of you Don't know which is probably almost all of you right?

508
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,744
Speaker 0: Is this really old anime from 1993?

509
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:34,165
Speaker 0: It's a movie.

510
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:36,254
Speaker 0: That's it.

511
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:40,255
Speaker 0: And basically this movie is Free willy the movie.

512
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,339
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look up the year.

513
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,704
Speaker 0: Free Willy was also 1993, huh?

514
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:47,510
Speaker 0: I wonder right, but I don't know anyway.

515
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:52,946
Speaker 0: So basically what it was about is it was his kid who finds basically the Loch Ness monster.

516
00:31:52,986 --> 00:31:56,194
Speaker 0: It's like a cute little baby Sea dinosaur.

517
00:31:56,235 --> 00:31:58,766
Speaker 0: it's got you know, like flippers in front but a long neck.

518
00:31:58,806 --> 00:32:02,442
Speaker 0: so it looks like you know One of those sea dinosaurs, you know, I'm talking about.

519
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:07,507
Speaker 0: I forget the name of that dinosaur If any paleontologist would like to hook me up with the name of the.

520
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:13,090
Speaker 0: you know The ocean e dinosaurs that have the flippers but the long necks right like the non-existent brontosaurus.

521
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:15,399
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's one of those.

522
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,384
Speaker 0: it's a sea monster.

523
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:17,550
Speaker 0: He finds it when it's a baby.

524
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:21,407
Speaker 0: I think it sort of grows up and the movie is about like setting it free.

525
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:22,110
Speaker 0: right, you know.

526
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:24,800
Speaker 0: And he lives, you know, he lives in a tropical island.

527
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,346
Speaker 0: There's not too many people around.

528
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:29,299
Speaker 0: he discovers it He befriends it sets it free.

529
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:31,450
Speaker 0: the whole right guys come looking for it.

530
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:36,263
Speaker 0: It's kind of an ET Free Willy situation and it's actually a really high quality movie.

531
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:38,630
Speaker 0: That is pretty much completely unknown.

532
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:41,096
Speaker 0: I remember it being like surprisingly good.

533
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,921
Speaker 0: better than Free Willy, right?

534
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:44,465
Speaker 1: I never saw Free Willy.

535
00:32:45,026 --> 00:32:50,059
Speaker 0: It's the same thing only better And I don't know where you can possibly watch this.

536
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,225
Speaker 0: Good luck finding a fansub.

537
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:53,128
Speaker 0: We're working on it.

538
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:53,890
Speaker 0: Good luck.

539
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:54,939
Speaker 1: We'll get it out there.

540
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,692
Speaker 1: if anyone can get it out there We can do it.

541
00:32:56,813 --> 00:33:00,730
Speaker 0: the only copy that I know of is at the RIT Anime Club on the VHS tape.

542
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:02,416
Speaker 1: We're gonna do something about that.

543
00:33:02,476 --> 00:33:04,142
Speaker 1: I got a VCR right over there.

544
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:07,940
Speaker 0: Yes, so that's that What I remember.

545
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,249
Speaker 1: let's just go right down this list.

546
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:11,509
Speaker 1: Surprisingly, this is a bad one.

547
00:33:11,876 --> 00:33:23,067
Speaker 1: I mean, you know You all know Odean because Daryl Surratt masterfully keeps reminding everyone that that movie exists when we really should Think it's because they keep reminding everyone of Odean because of the niche.

548
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:28,430
Speaker 1: true But I feel like we'd be better off if we just killed everyone involved who had knowledge of it and just buried it.

549
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:29,035
Speaker 1: that was the end.

550
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:36,228
Speaker 1: but I The only reason great digital target is not worse than Odean is because Odean is like 80 hours long.

551
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:39,621
Speaker 0: Yeah, so great digital target.

552
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:40,204
Speaker 0: That's another one.

553
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:43,235
Speaker 0: We just saw it in the library We picked it up and we watched it right.

554
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:48,350
Speaker 0: and usually when we watch stuff like, you know, there wasn't much that was bad.

555
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:54,090
Speaker 0: You know everything tended to either be okay average good mildly entertaining, right?

556
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,947
Speaker 0: There wasn't anything that we would all be like, oh god, this is terrible.

557
00:33:58,007 --> 00:33:58,510
Speaker 0: turn it off.

558
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:02,107
Speaker 1: Plus we were watching anime kind of always like every Saturday.

559
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:02,810
Speaker 1: We'd all get together.

560
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,237
Speaker 1: We had a pile of like ten tapes.

561
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:06,810
Speaker 0: We'd pick not even on Saturday like just turn a week.

562
00:34:07,331 --> 00:34:12,268
Speaker 1: Well Saturdays were the days we like play D&D for four hours and then we'd watch anime and then we'd watch.

563
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:17,007
Speaker 1: we'd always watch like One show and then it'd be like two of them or like one in the morning or something.

564
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:22,510
Speaker 1: We're like, alright That's why I was asleep during let's watch another show and no one ever remembered what that second show was.

565
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,244
Speaker 0: yeah, but you know, we watch great digital target.

566
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:33,666
Speaker 0: once is a movie and It's a sci-fi about a dude and I'm trying to go completely on memory here, right?

567
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:38,219
Speaker 0: There was some evil Empire that had like a big tower of machinery.

568
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:46,409
Speaker 0: that was evil and ruling the world and this guy was and he had to go Target, he was the digital target and he had to fight it and he had a friend who was like a robot torso.

569
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,541
Speaker 1: He wasn't a torso the whole time.

570
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:48,822
Speaker 1: He got.

571
00:34:48,862 --> 00:34:50,110
Speaker 0: no there was a woman.

572
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:53,089
Speaker 0: So here's what this movie is about and I don't know what's up with the movie.

573
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:59,083
Speaker 1: I think you see your boobs once with a guy who is like a cool kind of hip normal guy like.

574
00:34:59,104 --> 00:35:04,725
Speaker 1: well He's basically the protagonist type and a girl randomly becomes naked and just hanging out with him.

575
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:13,981
Speaker 1: and then not too long later There's a robot who is a torso and this one arm and a face this every somehow Climbing a cliff.

576
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:14,810
Speaker 0: that happens at the end.

577
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:19,687
Speaker 0: Everything in the movie is really quiet and slow except the robot who actually talks more.

578
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:20,430
Speaker 1: as far as I can help.

579
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:27,250
Speaker 1: Nothing fucking happens in this movie and it is notable primarily for the fact that it's building up to the so-called climax.

580
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,709
Speaker 1: They're gonna go fight the tower literally freeze-frame.

581
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:40,590
Speaker 1: The freeze-frame starts to like shake and text appears that says five minutes later The signal stopped coming out of the tower and then the credits roll.

582
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:43,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically the dude goes to the tower Right and they don't.

583
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,530
Speaker 0: there's no cool action scene of getting into the tower fighting anything in there.

584
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,256
Speaker 0: It's basically just like he goes to the tower Going to the tower.

585
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:57,014
Speaker 1: if it was me or if it was our friend Pete or if it was Alex Maybe it was Greg.

586
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:02,190
Speaker 1: but someone at the end said what we all felt which was what the fuck was that bullshit?

587
00:36:02,653 --> 00:36:03,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's basically no ending.

588
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,709
Speaker 0: It's just like here's a picture of the bad guy bad guys lair.

589
00:36:08,691 --> 00:36:14,212
Speaker 0: Okay, he went and then some text scrolls by and there's a picture of some fire and they don't tell you if he lived or Died.

590
00:36:14,232 --> 00:36:14,794
Speaker 0: they don't tell it.

591
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:15,719
Speaker 0: There's no animation.

592
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:16,362
Speaker 0: There's no nothing.

593
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:19,695
Speaker 1: I guess like in in our culture like In college.

594
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:24,530
Speaker 1: great digital target was to all of us what Odine is now to the greater anime community.

595
00:36:25,571 --> 00:36:26,073
Speaker 1: Cuz we'd like.

596
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:32,175
Speaker 1: we had all seen many of us Odine, but we had all mercifully seen these sci-fi cut Mmm cuts.

597
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:33,870
Speaker 1: what like two hours out of that movie?

598
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there is that there is a manga for great little target that I've seen in some places.

599
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,494
Speaker 1: I have it somewhere.

600
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:40,016
Speaker 1: Do you?

601
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:41,904
Speaker 1: yeah, I bought it and the MD guys.

602
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:44,596
Speaker 0: Let me see if it's up on that shelf there I'm trying to look with my eyeballs.

603
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:45,581
Speaker 0: I think it's in a box.

604
00:36:45,943 --> 00:36:46,305
Speaker 0: Okay.

605
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:47,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, have you read it?

606
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,097
Speaker 0: I mean, what's what's now?

607
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:51,004
Speaker 1: I don't even I don't even know if I still have it.

608
00:36:51,024 --> 00:36:52,470
Speaker 1: I might have given it away possibly.

609
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:54,738
Speaker 0: Anyway, great little target like before.

610
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,085
Speaker 0: we knew about things like Odine.

611
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:58,716
Speaker 0: like that was our go-to Example of bad anime.

612
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:03,730
Speaker 1: Yep, of course not to be outdone by Legend of Lemmyre, which I can't remember much about it Except there were boobs all over.

613
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,268
Speaker 0: Well, there's me this Legend of Lemmyre Legend of Chris Tanya and all I remember about either.

614
00:37:07,288 --> 00:37:16,970
Speaker 0: one Well sucked was that there are both really shitty Fantasy OAV slash movies, I guess I don't even remember and they were just generic fantasy crap with boobs.

615
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,404
Speaker 0: That really reminded me of that, you know, big big boob fantasy art.

616
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:21,930
Speaker 0: You see it like different conventions.

617
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,966
Speaker 1: It's always like the big breasted woman straddling a sword that itself is on a snake.

618
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:28,270
Speaker 0: With a chain mail bikini.

619
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,855
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

620
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:32,222
Speaker 0: That's all I remember about both of those.

621
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,077
Speaker 0: My memory could be completely inaccurate But that's all I remember.

622
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:37,364
Speaker 0: But Lemmyre and Chris Tanya.

623
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:46,581
Speaker 1: But I think right around that time I think what had happened is we at some point saw a bastard So bastard, oh man, that's a sort of one that's like so forgotten.

624
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:48,186
Speaker 1: But it's so fucking awesome.

625
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,470
Speaker 0: It is quite awesome.

626
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:54,910
Speaker 0: So bastard is a fantasy anime and it's one of those situations where it's like the bad guys the good guy, right?

627
00:37:55,310 --> 00:38:01,847
Speaker 0: It's like there's all kinds of evil demons and there's one evil demon who is like the fighting for the bad the good guys But he's still bad.

628
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:05,230
Speaker 0: But he's you know on the he's fighting against all the other bad guys.

629
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,150
Speaker 0: So the good guys are with him and the thing that got us immediately hooked us on bastard, right?

630
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:18,759
Speaker 0: Besides the fact that it was called bastard and besides the fact that there are funny jokes and also the same kind of boobage you Get in Chris Tanya and Lemmyre was that every.

631
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,467
Speaker 0: the name of everything was a metal reference.

632
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,470
Speaker 0: Metallicana.

633
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:30,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, Metallicana and Thraxia You know every single thing in the show was named after some 80s metal band.

634
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:31,752
Speaker 1: It's good stuff.

635
00:38:32,314 --> 00:38:36,706
Speaker 1: And I think as I recall it's actually a good show like it's worth watching.

636
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:44,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Bastard like there's a manga - I don't know how much of that if any is out in English or how hard it would Get the bastard anime.

637
00:38:44,877 --> 00:38:45,923
Speaker 1: I didn't even watch all of it.

638
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:47,190
Speaker 1: I want I think I fell asleep.

639
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:52,790
Speaker 1: We watched like a bit of it and then I remember watching like three like multiple.

640
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:53,956
Speaker 0: It was epilogue episodes.

641
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:58,517
Speaker 0: It was either an OAV or a show, but we were watching it But I only I watched less than five of them.

642
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,403
Speaker 1: I think we all watched bastard.

643
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:08,083
Speaker 0: complete collection on Amazon 1660 bucks, uh, I pay like 20 volume 1910 bucks.

644
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:11,913
Speaker 0: So there's at least 19 volumes in English It's just not the manga.

645
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:17,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's though the manga 19 volumes, but the complete collection on DVD $60 I'm pretty sure what?

646
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:28,539
Speaker 1: BHS boxset $13, I think we watched like the crew watched the first bit of it like one tape and then like half of us watched more Individually on our own.

647
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,317
Speaker 1: Mmm Bastard and berserk.

648
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:36,930
Speaker 1: we watched both of those and then I think we were looking for more stuff Like at least 20 manga volumes out in English.

649
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:42,331
Speaker 1: But I think we were looking for more stuff like bastard and berserk and then we got fucked by a legend of Lemnier and all That.

650
00:39:42,612 --> 00:39:46,085
Speaker 0: yeah, but you know, if I go watch the legend Lemnier today, maybe it'll be good.

651
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:46,486
Speaker 0: I don't know.

652
00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:48,596
Speaker 1: I Don't think so.

653
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:49,462
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

654
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:50,407
Speaker 1: I have this feeling.

655
00:39:50,427 --> 00:39:50,850
Speaker 0: All right.

656
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,203
Speaker 0: So we're coming up on some of the things that are remember as much.

657
00:39:53,263 --> 00:39:53,585
Speaker 0: Yeah.

658
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,912
Speaker 1: Well Goku doe I don't know.

659
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:55,274
Speaker 1: I don't know.

660
00:39:55,294 --> 00:39:58,250
Speaker 1: if you listeners let us know if you ever heard of or seen Goku doe.

661
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:06,459
Speaker 1: It's basically it's a slayers like but everyone's jerks, especially the main character And I just remember being really really freaking funny.

662
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:08,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was something like me.

663
00:40:08,525 --> 00:40:19,430
Speaker 0: I remember Goku was like a show and Like they were TV the DVDs for it were everywhere Like someone had printed a whole bunch of DVDs for it and tried to sell it and I don't think anyone bought it.

664
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:28,029
Speaker 1: But we watched it at some point and like the early episodes are wicked funny Halfway through it looks kind of thing where the main character doesn't want to do the.

665
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:30,730
Speaker 1: you know The magic thing where him and his brother have to combine their swords.

666
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,573
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

667
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:33,921
Speaker 0: I remember there was a funny genie and some other father.

668
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:34,744
Speaker 1: He's awesome.

669
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:35,527
Speaker 1: So is the Sphinx.

670
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:38,598
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah, there was just these funny characters.

671
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:41,809
Speaker 0: You too doing funny stuff catchy opening and ending music.

672
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:44,261
Speaker 0: And it was.

673
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,110
Speaker 0: it was a comedic fantasy show.

674
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,089
Speaker 0: That's all I remember.

675
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:50,200
Speaker 0: But we started watching it and then we stopped watching it.

676
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:57,170
Speaker 1: think at one point that the demon guys like Goku doe I'll make you King for your soul and he's like, can I just give you that guy's soul?

677
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,361
Speaker 1: And he's like, I don't think it works that way.

678
00:40:59,402 --> 00:40:59,683
Speaker 1: You know what?

679
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:00,025
Speaker 1: Why not?

680
00:41:00,045 --> 00:41:00,709
Speaker 1: Let's go for it.

681
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:03,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was just a show like that.

682
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,225
Speaker 1: That was the show where he eats the soul.

683
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:06,550
Speaker 1: He's just like oh, yeah.

684
00:41:06,976 --> 00:41:15,824
Speaker 0: That's why I always thought that Akamaka was from that show instead of ko beast because that's all eating and the sort of comp comedic Demonish stuff not to be confused with soul eater.

685
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:16,688
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

686
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:21,220
Speaker 0: but yeah, I mean Go kiddo, they printed so many DVDs.

687
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,063
Speaker 0: I can't imagine.

688
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:23,730
Speaker 0: it's gotta be cheap to get them all.

689
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,797
Speaker 1: I don't remember when it came out.

690
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:29,522
Speaker 1: I think we were watching it like circa 2004. just went to Luke's house all the time.

691
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:30,910
Speaker 1: Remember we watch it with him and Gabby.

692
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:35,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone's got to go and like resurrect that show but not like for reals.

693
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:38,116
Speaker 0: just someone get all the DVDs Dude, put it on crunchyroll.

694
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:39,262
Speaker 1: I'm sure people would watch it.

695
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:40,507
Speaker 0: Maybe it is on crunchyroll.

696
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:41,809
Speaker 1: Oh if it is I'll watch it again.

697
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:42,412
Speaker 0: I don't know.

698
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:44,097
Speaker 1: after I finished doing is people?

699
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:46,304
Speaker 0: I never watched that many episodes of it.

700
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:49,637
Speaker 0: people told me that towards the end It's not funny anymore.

701
00:41:49,658 --> 00:41:51,286
Speaker 0: Yeah loses what it had.

702
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:51,969
Speaker 1: I heard that too.

703
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:57,187
Speaker 1: Of course, I don't know if this is obscure or not, but I think it's obscured.

704
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,974
Speaker 1: now again Dragon half.

705
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,178
Speaker 0: there's a manga.

706
00:42:01,198 --> 00:42:04,790
Speaker 0: Do you want to store that the story of dragon half which is probably true?

707
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:05,691
Speaker 1: I don't.

708
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:09,068
Speaker 1: I don't think we should because I got to research that because I don't know.

709
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,377
Speaker 0: Yes, mostly just hearsay that.

710
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:13,624
Speaker 1: so what the rumor was?

711
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:15,230
Speaker 1: back at RIT I searched.

712
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:20,650
Speaker 1: Okay, there was that there was a manga dragon half and the guy who made it got in trouble for some sort of perverted thing.

713
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:21,995
Speaker 1: And then the manga stopped.

714
00:42:22,196 --> 00:42:25,650
Speaker 1: but they made an anime about it, but the anime only covers the first bit of the manga.

715
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:29,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically anime is two episodes right now.

716
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:31,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Think that shows hilarious.

717
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,830
Speaker 0: It is the I don't know what the manga is about.

718
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:39,290
Speaker 0: I think at the amount heard the manga is more perverted and that doesn't surprise me with the story of the guy being perverted.

719
00:42:39,671 --> 00:42:45,190
Speaker 0: But the anime is significantly less perverted and is really hilarious even though there's only two episodes.

720
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:45,970
Speaker 0: It's really funny.

721
00:42:46,552 --> 00:42:52,334
Speaker 0: It's about this girl whose mom's a dragon and dad or dad's the night who went to slay the dragon as a Connecticut and then Funny shit.

722
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:53,119
Speaker 1: They got it on.

723
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:54,549
Speaker 1: yeah dragons are all cute.

724
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:02,710
Speaker 1: There's so many like jokes I could make about the show, but it's so short I can't spoil it for you.

725
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:07,104
Speaker 0: Just watch it and it's got the bad guys a little slime jelly thing.

726
00:43:07,204 --> 00:43:07,726
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

727
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:08,268
Speaker 1: You're good.

728
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:08,890
Speaker 1: slime half.

729
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,906
Speaker 1: There's a reference to about dragon half.

730
00:43:11,947 --> 00:43:12,490
Speaker 1: for any of you?

731
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:15,810
Speaker 1: So old anime stuff with slayers.

732
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:29,387
Speaker 1: So In the slayers movie in the dub they make a reference to a slime half Which is actually a reference to dragon half because there is a slime half in dragon half.

733
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:32,017
Speaker 1: Yeah It's just great.

734
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:34,110
Speaker 1: and watch the closing animation.

735
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:36,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, the closing animation is the way.

736
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:38,485
Speaker 0: neither the opening animation is bad either.

737
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,070
Speaker 1: So let's go way back to before.

738
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:40,814
Speaker 1: I was RIT.

739
00:43:40,874 --> 00:43:41,839
Speaker 1: I was an anime fan.

740
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:53,930
Speaker 0: I already watched everything in blockbuster Except they added a tape and it was called the lens man, you know I can't even remember anything about the lens man anime other than we joked about it a lot.

741
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:58,890
Speaker 0: So I actually read a lot of the lens min books relatively recently like a year few ago.

742
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:05,341
Speaker 1: it was on the sci-fi channel and I watched it and all I remember is that it was sci-fi.

743
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:14,970
Speaker 1: and then I fell asleep and I woke up and He was flying with the green guy through this crazy scene and then the movie ended and I missed I guess all the plots.

744
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,879
Speaker 1: I had no idea what happened and they never showed it again.

745
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:19,109
Speaker 0: And meanwhile Pete had the tape too, right?

746
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:20,918
Speaker 0: So it's like we weren't alone.

747
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:25,544
Speaker 0: like lens min was like within our group I had like multiple people who had knew about it and had it.

748
00:44:25,765 --> 00:44:26,650
Speaker 1: there was a weird point.

749
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,040
Speaker 0: I had a tape around here somewhere.

750
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:34,546
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got the tape later in my life I was at a blockbuster and I want to see the tape from where I'm sitting.

751
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:39,490
Speaker 1: I wanted yes right over there I wanted to see it again and I was looking for it with my mom.

752
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:48,920
Speaker 1: I had like a blockbuster sale and this anime nerd was there, you know I'd never run into an anime fan other than myself before and you know my crew of people and he was like the lens.

753
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,647
Speaker 1: min is difficult to get because it were.

754
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:53,620
Speaker 1: there was a problem with The licensing and it was pulled from the shelves.

755
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,535
Speaker 1: So if you find a VHS tape is actually valuable I'm sure and I was like fuck.

756
00:44:58,258 --> 00:44:59,161
Speaker 1: so I'd forgotten about it.

757
00:44:59,181 --> 00:45:07,188
Speaker 1: and then we watched it again at RIT and I fell asleep at some point and I remember ever watching it at RIT.

758
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,715
Speaker 1: I don't know if you were there But we like you like.

759
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:12,730
Speaker 0: I remember certain things that we tried to watch them and I fell asleep.

760
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,461
Speaker 0: Right, for example, like I think we tried to watch kotocha and I fell asleep.

761
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:17,027
Speaker 0: Yep, and certain Lupin movies.

762
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:21,850
Speaker 0: I fell asleep Yeah, but I don't remember ever trying movies are dangerous to follow.

763
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:26,634
Speaker 0: I don't remember ever watching or falling asleep during The last.

764
00:45:26,735 --> 00:45:28,743
Speaker 1: the last time I fell asleep during a Lupin movie.

765
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,390
Speaker 1: It was normally upon action.

766
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:37,050
Speaker 1: I fall asleep I wake up and there is a brain in a rocket like a gigantic brain.

767
00:45:37,211 --> 00:45:39,524
Speaker 1: I was mama flying out into space.

768
00:45:39,624 --> 00:45:43,250
Speaker 1: Yeah Don't fall asleep during the pond movies.

769
00:45:43,613 --> 00:45:53,463
Speaker 1: I don't think you were there but I remember us watching Lensman and all I know is that I fell asleep and I woke up during the same fucking scene where he's flying with the green Guy through some crazy scene and that it ended.

770
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:58,323
Speaker 0: and I still don't know what happened I think is why did I always wake up at the end of things miraculously somehow?

771
00:45:58,885 --> 00:46:02,177
Speaker 1: maybe because the energy of the room You know, they only those old movies always played.

772
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:07,708
Speaker 0: that kind of early 90s synthesizer rock would have happened If everyone fell asleep during the movie.

773
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:14,345
Speaker 1: We just wake up like four hours later static on the TV the next day.

774
00:46:14,365 --> 00:46:16,010
Speaker 1: that would have been awful.

775
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:18,219
Speaker 1: I'm so glad that never had imagine this.

776
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,130
Speaker 1: it's Sunday night where it's like 4 in the morning.

777
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,880
Speaker 1: We're watching some anime and you just wake up.

778
00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:25,385
Speaker 1: You don't know what time it is.

779
00:46:25,405 --> 00:46:26,730
Speaker 1: You're probably late for class.

780
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,444
Speaker 0: There's just static on the TV, you know, everyone else is still there sleeping.

781
00:46:31,524 --> 00:46:33,350
Speaker 1: You don't even remember what you watched.

782
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,755
Speaker 0: No, everyone fell asleep during it.

783
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:37,239
Speaker 0: that never happened.

784
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:38,061
Speaker 0: No, luckily.

785
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:48,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there but there but for the grace of God when we But yeah kotocha we didn't even we watched the summary movie as far as I can tell

786
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:57,125
Speaker 0: and we fell asleep during it We thought not because it wasn't, you know I've seen a lot of clips from kotocha and it seems like it's a totally hilarious

787
00:46:57,145 --> 00:46:58,913
Speaker 1: fell asleep because it was 4 in the fucking Morning,

788
00:46:58,994 --> 00:47:00,930
Speaker 0: it's a totally hilarious silly kind of show.

789
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:03,090
Speaker 0: I kind of actually want to go back and see if I can watch it again.

790
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I fell asleep the one time we actually watched it.

791
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:07,510
Speaker 0: So I don't remember shit.

792
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:11,330
Speaker 1: It was like that and Kimigurri orange road and marmalade boy.

793
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:21,350
Speaker 0: Well, those are a lot of the shojos that were fans that the people who were running the club before we got there were big Fans of those, you know those shojo series so they had them all in the library.

794
00:47:21,832 --> 00:47:24,863
Speaker 0: I never really attempted to watch them, but I think you did right.

795
00:47:25,224 --> 00:47:26,770
Speaker 0: there was like please save my earth was another one.

796
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:28,404
Speaker 1: Oh my god, please save my.

797
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,496
Speaker 1: I Both loved and hated.

798
00:47:30,536 --> 00:47:31,420
Speaker 1: please save my earth.

799
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:35,400
Speaker 1: when I watched it like I was fascinated by it But I couldn't figure out if it was good.

800
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah No, no one in the crew watched.

801
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:49,410
Speaker 1: that put me back then and like marmalade boy and kor Especially we're really really popular like in the club, but I don't think they were that popular Outside of the club in America.

802
00:47:49,591 --> 00:47:53,949
Speaker 0: You don't hear anyone mentioning Kimigurri orange road or marmalade, right?

803
00:47:54,470 --> 00:48:02,428
Speaker 1: You hear more mentions of touch than you hear of those Joe Yep, except you hear about those shows in the club and among the people in our crew who like no show.

804
00:48:02,469 --> 00:48:05,418
Speaker 1: Joe Mmm, like Laura remembers all those shows.

805
00:48:05,498 --> 00:48:14,950
Speaker 0: It seems like it's like just the people that were like, you know, like Networking Lee close to us right and spread out for the right date like no those shows but no else.

806
00:48:15,352 --> 00:48:17,124
Speaker 1: Wow, you reminded me of please save my earth.

807
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:17,970
Speaker 1: that came out of nowhere.

808
00:48:18,352 --> 00:48:19,256
Speaker 1: There was the show where.

809
00:48:19,578 --> 00:48:22,190
Speaker 1: so here's the plot of please save my earth because it's really cool idea.

810
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:31,588
Speaker 1: Right, you got a bunch of people and they all have weird like individually have weird dreams all the time and one of them puts an ad like in the newspaper like hey, do you have dreams about this?

811
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:44,688
Speaker 1: and Like this group of people because of this ad come together and they none of them knew each other but they all realize that they're all having the exact same dreams and the dreams involved like a future past and a base on the moon.

812
00:48:44,709 --> 00:48:49,589
Speaker 1: and You know, they do some telescoping and they see the fucking base on the moon.

813
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:52,583
Speaker 0: So the base on the moon is giving them dreams about self.

814
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:54,230
Speaker 1: They had a past life of some kind.

815
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:59,090
Speaker 1: they have all these memories of it and It could just be a loose nation or something crazy.

816
00:48:59,451 --> 00:49:03,102
Speaker 1: But then they find kind of real evidence that no something really happened.

817
00:49:03,122 --> 00:49:03,964
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

818
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,027
Speaker 1: And that is a cool premise.

819
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:05,789
Speaker 1: I think for a show.

820
00:49:06,951 --> 00:49:11,669
Speaker 1: It goes way off the deep end from there and I have no idea.

821
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,834
Speaker 0: Cool premise.

822
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:15,325
Speaker 0: I didn't even know that and what the show was about until just now.

823
00:49:15,566 --> 00:49:16,490
Speaker 1: we should watch it again.

824
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:17,575
Speaker 1: I got it somewhere.

825
00:49:17,615 --> 00:49:18,881
Speaker 1: I got a VHS tape it off it.

826
00:49:19,102 --> 00:49:20,790
Speaker 0: I'm sure thing is you've already told me the premise.

827
00:49:20,973 --> 00:49:22,028
Speaker 0: So what do I need to watch it for?

828
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:23,472
Speaker 0: Discovering.

829
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:25,682
Speaker 0: I think the awesome part of the show would be discovering.

830
00:49:25,742 --> 00:49:26,043
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

831
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,028
Speaker 0: You actually did have a secret.

832
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:27,530
Speaker 0: pass the end.

833
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:29,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's more to it than that.

834
00:49:29,637 --> 00:49:32,189
Speaker 0: and I there was a radio drama, but it goes on the deep end.

835
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:37,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't know if that's just because the anime was like compressing and then stops.

836
00:49:37,847 --> 00:49:38,470
Speaker 0: Was there a manga?

837
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:40,579
Speaker 1: I don't know, but there's a radio drama.

838
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:43,370
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about this show except that had a really good soundtrack.

839
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:55,463
Speaker 0: I mean that there were a lot of shows that like they were just Constantly like I kept seeing the shows or seeing characters from the shows when we were in the anime club But I never watched them or knew anything about them like Sabre Jay and such.

840
00:49:55,704 --> 00:50:02,092
Speaker 1: Sabre Jay was kind of like a poor man's Tenshi, it has a bullshit ending like I didn't watch it I don't even know.

841
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:08,482
Speaker 0: imagine a show that does about like catgirl nukunuku or oh man Video girl.

842
00:50:08,562 --> 00:50:10,172
Speaker 1: I Video girl.

843
00:50:10,293 --> 00:50:11,616
Speaker 1: I was really popular.

844
00:50:11,797 --> 00:50:14,906
Speaker 0: Not dnangel but DNA Squared.

845
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:16,370
Speaker 1: Adam fucking loves that show.

846
00:50:16,651 --> 00:50:17,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was cute.

847
00:50:18,256 --> 00:50:21,347
Speaker 1: or uh, Birdie the Mighty, but I think after Gerald reviewed it.

848
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:22,210
Speaker 1: I think it had a resurgence.

849
00:50:22,431 --> 00:50:24,316
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that was at a sequel even.

850
00:50:24,457 --> 00:50:27,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really like the sequel actually.

851
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:27,787
Speaker 0: I haven't watched it.

852
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:28,770
Speaker 1: It's worth watching.

853
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:29,413
Speaker 1: It's really fun.

854
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:32,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, but oh god, so you see what happened.

855
00:50:32,645 --> 00:50:35,035
Speaker 1: suddenly remembering all these shows I'd completely forgotten about.

856
00:50:35,396 --> 00:50:38,207
Speaker 1: but Sabre Jay has just the bullshit is ending ever.

857
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:39,692
Speaker 1: imagine ending Where you.

858
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,139
Speaker 1: the entire plot point involves some huge sacrifice.

859
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,729
Speaker 1: All right, and then in the credits just don't do that for no reason.

860
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:48,508
Speaker 1: Just undo all the sacrifice would keep the rest.

861
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:50,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, man.

862
00:50:50,874 --> 00:50:55,090
Speaker 0: I just I mean there's even shows that were like, you know more recent than that.

863
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,865
Speaker 0: You think no one would forget them like great teacher onizuka, but that shows been forgotten, right?

864
00:50:58,985 --> 00:51:00,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, who's remembering that?

865
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:07,330
Speaker 1: Like video girl I was popular as far as I can tell like it seemed really popular and anime cons.

866
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:12,730
Speaker 1: But no one I know has ever actually watched more than like a few minutes of it.

867
00:51:13,252 --> 00:51:17,689
Speaker 1: I've never actually watched it, but it seems like everyone I met at cons knew what it was.

868
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:19,223
Speaker 1: now No one at cons knows what it is.

869
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:21,117
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

870
00:51:21,177 --> 00:51:22,489
Speaker 0: Do we want to keep going here?

871
00:51:23,491 --> 00:51:24,153
Speaker 0: Memory is sorry.

872
00:51:24,194 --> 00:51:28,350
Speaker 0: I'm trying to like a picture like the sea of tapes and like to remember individual things.

873
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,370
Speaker 1: There's that a SMAP concert we had on tape.

874
00:51:31,537 --> 00:51:34,861
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah No I do and I did mention early in the show Horace Prince of Sun.

875
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:39,276
Speaker 0: if you can find Horace Prince of the Sun it might Also be holus Prince of Sun.

876
00:51:39,316 --> 00:51:39,958
Speaker 0: Basically.

877
00:51:40,419 --> 00:51:44,370
Speaker 0: This is an old Toei movie and like Miyazaki worked on it.

878
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,050
Speaker 0: He didn't direct it, but he worked on it.

879
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,650
Speaker 0: It's like you can think of it sort of as like the first Miyazaki work is it?

880
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:55,210
Speaker 0: You can see a lot in common between it and the things he did later and it does show its age.

881
00:51:55,250 --> 00:52:01,850
Speaker 0: You know, it's an old, you know old the oldly styled animated thing, but I really liked it when I watched it.

882
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,397
Speaker 0: I kind of really want to watch it again.

883
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:06,390
Speaker 0: It's you know, that quiet watch it at night kind of thing.

884
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,113
Speaker 0: It's pretty awesome.

885
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,939
Speaker 0: I wish they would release a DVD.

886
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:22,210
Speaker 0: like they don't have to release a DVD of just that but they should Like, you know Take that and package it with a bunch of other things all together, you know That's not a bad idea.

887
00:52:22,531 --> 00:52:27,727
Speaker 0: Horace Prince of Sun and a bunch of other similarly old Toei movies all together on one disc.

888
00:52:27,888 --> 00:52:28,570
Speaker 0: That would be pretty cool.

889
00:52:29,093 --> 00:52:31,106
Speaker 1: I think a lot of the shows we talked about would do really well.

890
00:52:31,146 --> 00:52:32,971
Speaker 1: on crunchyroll Probably.

891
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:36,282
Speaker 1: yeah, I don't know so much about things like marmalade boy.

892
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,550
Speaker 1: I don't know if the demographic is there anymore.

893
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:39,194
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

894
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:40,301
Speaker 1: It's hard to say though.

895
00:52:40,382 --> 00:52:41,690
Speaker 0: Let's see which one of these could do.

896
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:47,030
Speaker 1: Well, I think that I think dragon half would be like a one-shot like wonder if it was just on crunchyroll.

897
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:52,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, it might be hard to just sell the two episodes For free and then people would like it.

898
00:52:52,130 --> 00:53:05,783
Speaker 0: I think if you did a remake of bastard that removed the porniness but kept the awesome hilarity metal references Yeah, I think that you could definitely do some koto cha Sort of remarketing to get that out there polish it up.

899
00:53:06,024 --> 00:53:07,730
Speaker 1: I think kimigiri orange road could be read.

900
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:08,231
Speaker 1: I think.

901
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:09,856
Speaker 0: who could be sold as a movie?

902
00:53:09,977 --> 00:53:14,310
Speaker 0: if you write something like that easily great digital target would probably burn really really.

903
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:17,190
Speaker 0: These I think pretty much have no marketable value.

904
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:18,649
Speaker 1: It depends.

905
00:53:19,691 --> 00:53:28,070
Speaker 1: Gokudo is one thing where I think if you put it on crunchyroll It would get popular among the people who like things like slayers.

906
00:53:29,571 --> 00:53:30,455
Speaker 0: It's it's hard though.

907
00:53:30,475 --> 00:53:31,258
Speaker 0: How many you know?

908
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:33,989
Speaker 1: the thing is slayers should also be on crunchyroll.

909
00:53:35,873 --> 00:53:37,287
Speaker 0: Yeah slayer should be on crunchyroll.

910
00:53:37,307 --> 00:53:37,590
Speaker 0: you're right.

911
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:41,887
Speaker 1: I think it would cause a whole resurgence of that kind of anime actually in America at least.

912
00:53:42,529 --> 00:53:43,433
Speaker 1: yeah I don't know.

913
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,055
Speaker 1: we're petering out.

914
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:46,164
Speaker 1: Let's just kick it off right here and kick it under.

915
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:46,826
Speaker 0: we're done.

916
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:49,838
Speaker 1: kick it out Devil doll.

917
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:52,151
Speaker 1: I Think it's time to kick it.

918
00:53:58,677 --> 00:54:01,220
