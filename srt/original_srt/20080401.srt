1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,305
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday April 1st.

2
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:12,108
Speaker 1: I'm Red.

3
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:16,219
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek knives tonight collectible gaming.

4
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:33,659
Speaker 0: Let's do this All right, it's it's the April Fool's Day.

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,085
Speaker 1: Scott is really down on April Fool's Day.

6
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:39,575
Speaker 0: I don't understand why suddenly suddenly I'm down in April Fool's Day.

7
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:49,129
Speaker 0: I'm down with April Fool's now because it Thanks to you know when I was a kid right April Fool's Day was awesome because no one hardly ever did anything.

8
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,050
Speaker 0: cuz you know Kids are afraid to do something and they didn't have the resources to really do anything.

9
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,310
Speaker 1: So I mean, well, you must have my school was like, I don't even it was like a war zone on April Fool's Day.

10
00:00:58,571 --> 00:01:01,267
Speaker 1: But sometimes we just get the day off because they didn't want to deal with it.

11
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:06,069
Speaker 0: So but I mean like, you know, if you put chalk in the eraser that was like, oh man.

12
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:15,750
Speaker 0: So, you know having actual pranks in April Fool's Day other than the ones we saw on TV and such was like, you know It would have been an amazing thing.

13
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,170
Speaker 0: So, you know as I got older like anticipating they're actually being pranks was like so awesome.

14
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:27,990
Speaker 0: But now with the Internet's right, it's like people have forgotten that they're not even pranking anymore.

15
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:33,070
Speaker 0: You know, I think I actually I think it goes back to the newspaper strip comics or an April Fool's Day.

16
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:41,034
Speaker 0: They would all sort of trade comics and like, you know The the peanuts guy would draw Garfield and the Garfield guy would draw Dilbert and you know They'd all mix it up.

17
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:44,250
Speaker 1: the web comics all did that people trying to read XKCD.

18
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,354
Speaker 0: Well, they didn't know they didn't.

19
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:49,030
Speaker 0: what they did is they said if you go to the one they just basically changed all their DNS.

20
00:01:49,673 --> 00:01:53,070
Speaker 0: So one website goes to the other goes the other which is a really clever idea.

21
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,514
Speaker 0: I think it's okay idea, but it's not the same as drawing the other guys comic Which actually I think the Wondermark guy.

22
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:06,938
Speaker 0: he drew his comic instead of you know, photoshopping it as usual, but I mean those aren't Pranks, that's just doing something silly.

23
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:13,001
Speaker 0: I mean and that's oh that's well and good and sometimes it can be amusing But it's not a prank it's not.

24
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:18,130
Speaker 0: you're not making a fool of anyone You actually have to make a fool of someone or it doesn't count in the book of Scott.

25
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:22,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and the book is Scott where nothing's a prank and yet you never pull any pranks.

26
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,989
Speaker 1: I've never seen you pull a prank in your life.

27
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:27,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I'm not gonna pull one if it's half-assed.

28
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:31,490
Speaker 0: I if I pulled prank it's gonna be so extravagant and so devastating.

29
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,393
Speaker 1: Yeah, I will see.

30
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:37,650
Speaker 1: see the thing is to me the best pranks aren't the ones that just publicly humiliate one person.

31
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,670
Speaker 1: They're the ones where you catch someone and even if it's not apparent they have that moment.

32
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:49,877
Speaker 1: It might even just be a second where they like go to the forum and see a thread That has a title of something.

33
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:54,746
Speaker 1: they go to a web page and the news is like RIAA Disbanded and it's April 1st.

34
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:55,852
Speaker 1: It's obvious It's a trick.

35
00:02:55,912 --> 00:03:01,230
Speaker 1: but for that second before the rational brain kicks in and says no, you're just a dumbass they go.

36
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,002
Speaker 1: Oh and that second is what I live for.

37
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,890
Speaker 0: that second doesn't do anything for me.

38
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:07,819
Speaker 0: Second is just like a groan.

39
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:11,658
Speaker 0: It's like ah, you're so lame I don't think anything does it for you anymore.

40
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,990
Speaker 1: everything everything's laying your man about everything.

41
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,470
Speaker 0: I see if there's a real April Fool's prank, right?

42
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:26,409
Speaker 0: You got to be running someone like all day and at the end of the day They're crushed like yeah, and they like they want to kill themselves because I'm so thoroughly put up or shut up.

43
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,583
Speaker 0: All right, it's just you know, you got to give me some years.

44
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:30,930
Speaker 0: It takes years to prepare something.

45
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,480
Speaker 1: I mean actually though the French guy.

46
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,030
Speaker 1: my work was pretty good with all this.

47
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,870
Speaker 1: All he did was pulled the classic French thing of hey, there's a fish on your back and he got everyone.

48
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,259
Speaker 1: He pulled it on except me because I knew what it was.

49
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, randomly, you know, here's here's the thing.

50
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,124
Speaker 1: It's like there's a fish on your back and I'm like, yep last last April Fool's Day.

51
00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:53,880
Speaker 0: I was fooled by a Somewhat good prank of the board game geek people.

52
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,870
Speaker 1: I know that bark did almost the exact same prank.

53
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,102
Speaker 0: That's actually approaching a good prank right approaching.

54
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,106
Speaker 1: That was brilliant.

55
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:01,688
Speaker 0: It was okay.

56
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:04,838
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, if that was okay, then what's great?

57
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:05,841
Speaker 1: I mean a tire iron.

58
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,627
Speaker 0: No, that's not a prank.

59
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,530
Speaker 0: That's just outright.

60
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:13,970
Speaker 0: See now what would be a great prank right like his tire iron.

61
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:17,827
Speaker 0: Well, no, like if someone is a kids one I just thought up right?

62
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:18,510
Speaker 0: This is a pro.

63
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,265
Speaker 0: This is not a great prank, but it's getting closer to one.

64
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:26,777
Speaker 1: Is it the Our friend who was afraid of class?

65
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:30,230
Speaker 0: for example someone gets to work and there's a message on their answering machine.

66
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:41,661
Speaker 0: That's actually from a police station talking about how their car has been broken into and then they go home early on the train and they go back to the parking lot and That's not a good prank.

67
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,412
Speaker 1: That's just being an asshole I know.

68
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:45,440
Speaker 0: and then right their car is there and they go.

69
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,002
Speaker 0: what the fuck.

70
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:54,712
Speaker 0: so they get in their car and then You know like something in the car like totally gets them like I don't know an inflating something or you know Something like that.

71
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:56,157
Speaker 1: That was like the worst prank ever.

72
00:04:56,177 --> 00:04:57,020
Speaker 0: That's a great brain.

73
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:57,603
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

74
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:58,827
Speaker 1: that's just being a jerk.

75
00:04:59,148 --> 00:04:59,630
Speaker 0: exactly.

76
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,996
Speaker 0: What do you think a prank is?

77
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,690
Speaker 0: you make someone feel like a dumbass and you make their life miserable?

78
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,073
Speaker 0: And then you laugh at them.

79
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:08,885
Speaker 1: No, no, no, it's so much more subtle and clever than that.

80
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:10,250
Speaker 1: No, you got it.

81
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:12,560
Speaker 1: This is why you don't pull pranks.

82
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,787
Speaker 1: This is why I'm the prank man.

83
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:16,116
Speaker 0: No Lame prank man.

84
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:18,750
Speaker 1: I prefer the more psychological pranks.

85
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:22,810
Speaker 0: No, it's a prank is all about laughing at other people suffering.

86
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:26,907
Speaker 1: No, a prank is about knowing that you got someone out there that someone went.

87
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:31,504
Speaker 1: Oh For that one sec, that doesn't do anything for me nothing does anything for you.

88
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:43,007
Speaker 0: Yeah laughing at people suffering great, all right, so Basically though despite me not being fooled by any actual April Fool's Day pranks today.

89
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:44,859
Speaker 0: I Fooled myself.

90
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,234
Speaker 0: Oh Yes, I woke up.

91
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:51,126
Speaker 0: I turned on my computer and such and I was like, it's April Fool's Day.

92
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:52,450
Speaker 0: Everything is bullshit.

93
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:54,900
Speaker 0: So I just I wasn't gonna read any web pages.

94
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,627
Speaker 0: I was gonna fill my iPod and go right.

95
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:05,632
Speaker 0: So I go to fill my iPod and in the feed for the Roadhouse the best blues podcast in the universe Right.

96
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:23,710
Speaker 0: It says Roadhouse announcement and I'm like Come on man, and he what you know, he doesn't you know Tony the Roadhouse guy doesn't seem like the guy kind of guy who would do pranks and whatnot, right and You know before I even listen I didn't even listen to it, right?

97
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:32,070
Speaker 0: I just you know sync my iPod, you know from upstairs, you know, and then I just sent him an email like You're not fooling me with your announcement stuff.

98
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,890
Speaker 0: It probably says something like the Roadhouse is gonna switch to being an 80s podcast instead of a blues podcast or something like that.

99
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:39,027
Speaker 0: Blah, all right.

100
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:48,086
Speaker 0: so I get on the train and I listen to it and It's actually a totally serious announcement that was actually posted late on March 31st.

101
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:48,848
Speaker 0: Good job.

102
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:54,847
Speaker 0: So I got to work and I was like, uh, I'm a dumbass [laughter].

103
00:06:56,373 --> 00:07:00,569
Speaker 0: So so in fact, I think There's a fish on your back.

104
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:17,942
Speaker 0: Yeah I think now because April Fool's Day is just so obvious and so overbearing and so lame That the way to really do April Fool's Day is to actually say something true that people are likely to disbelieve and thus they fool themselves.

105
00:07:18,363 --> 00:07:22,273
Speaker 0: and in fact a one website followed the same Philosophy.

106
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:24,982
Speaker 0: new scientist calm I think it is.

107
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:34,637
Speaker 0: Yes new scientist calm posted all stories that seem fake but aren't and It's really really good idea.

108
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:55,010
Speaker 0: I like that action because people read these headlines like dinosaur killer found in volcanic bubbles China's boom sparks mass species invasion Wings with elbows, you know, they're pretty crazy If you actually read these stories right universe's tiniest black hole discovered right, but they're all true stories.

109
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:56,467
Speaker 0: They just seem weird.

110
00:07:57,074 --> 00:08:03,130
Speaker 1: Well, I remember actually last year We got a lot of people surprisingly with a prank that we came up with at the last minute.

111
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:04,397
Speaker 1: We were allowed all day.

112
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,281
Speaker 1: We're like, what are we gonna do?

113
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:06,790
Speaker 1: Everyone does something on the internet?

114
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:15,045
Speaker 1: We got to do something but we don't want to do what everyone else does because it's usually not that good other than Like what board game geek and park did and we can't do that.

115
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:18,076
Speaker 1: It's already been done Yep, and you can't just Rick roll.

116
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:19,119
Speaker 1: someone cuz whatever.

117
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:28,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much I noticed I saw it coming a mile away to Everyone on the internet who wanted to do an April Fool's Day joke, right but was lazy about it.

118
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,518
Speaker 0: They all just did a Rick roll.

119
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:31,803
Speaker 0: YouTube did a Rick roll.

120
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,409
Speaker 0: Mahalo did a Rick roll.

121
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,303
Speaker 1: You know if I were YouTube what I would've done hollow or whatever.

122
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:36,905
Speaker 0: It's called for.

123
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:43,409
Speaker 1: just today I would have redirected every possible link to my site to a Rick roll all day.

124
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:47,424
Speaker 0: Just It's just so grown worthy.

125
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:48,310
Speaker 0: It's like it's great.

126
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:49,353
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

127
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:53,447
Speaker 1: see to me the Rick roll like Rick rolling someone itself is lame.

128
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:55,254
Speaker 1: It's obvious It's bloods like all.

129
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:58,828
Speaker 1: right, you're linked to something but it was actually a redirect to a Rick roll.

130
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:02,370
Speaker 1: Good job But to me the Rick roll doesn't symbolize that anymore.

131
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,007
Speaker 1: The proper use of a Rick roll is kind of like the modern equivalent of going.

132
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:10,442
Speaker 1: haha It's like you see that Rick roll.

133
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:12,310
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean I Rick rolled you.

134
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:17,406
Speaker 1: I'm just pointing out that I got you with something and the Rick roll is merely the means.

135
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,022
Speaker 1: you were tricked by Something else not just a link something beyond that.

136
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:26,456
Speaker 0: and the Rick roll is like hey Yeah, but a lot of people today have been.

137
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:30,970
Speaker 0: the Rick roll itself has been the trick and it's not a much better trick.

138
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,197
Speaker 0: It is not amusing.

139
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:33,624
Speaker 0: It just makes me groan.

140
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:33,685
Speaker 0: Ah

141
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,550
Speaker 1: Rick

142
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:50,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that I actually what someone should have done is coming up with something, you know They should have done the same trick as the Rick roll But coming up with something better than that video something else like, you know, perhaps some horrible two girls one cup Rick roll.

143
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,520
Speaker 0: Yeah force people to watch that mother.

144
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,830
Speaker 1: yeah, it's good but that's still the same joke.

145
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,934
Speaker 1: It's just oh.

146
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:02,328
Speaker 1: you thought you were clicking on a yeah one thing, but it was actually a link.

147
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:02,930
Speaker 0: right that's thing.

148
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:05,150
Speaker 0: That's the first part of the joke.

149
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:11,022
Speaker 0: The second part of the joke is them vomiting because they're watching the vomiting and me laughing at god You're like the worst prankster ever.

150
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:11,990
Speaker 1: I can just see this now.

151
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:30,806
Speaker 1: like what if we what if we like play the leak spin song in the background for like four hours until Scott Johnson freaks out trying to figure out what that song is before anyone else knew about the leak spin and Then we all laugh at him for like an hour after that and then you're like, yeah And then we fucking kill him and bury

152
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:31,128
Speaker 0: him out.

153
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:33,782
Speaker 0: bad You see cuz like the original pranks.

154
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:39,080
Speaker 1: right we're all like Original pranks like when look all raw was running around.

155
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:42,930
Speaker 0: No, like you give someone the hotfoot, you know, it's like that's not a prank.

156
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's criminal.

157
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:51,610
Speaker 0: I know it's criminal But that's that's where pranks came from the hotfoot the bucket of water on top of the door that kind of stuff.

158
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,294
Speaker 0: That's funny action right there.

159
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:56,744
Speaker 1: I don't agree with your philosophy on pranks one bit.

160
00:10:57,085 --> 00:10:58,228
Speaker 0: I like that kind of prank.

161
00:10:58,388 --> 00:10:58,909
Speaker 1: I prefer the.

162
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:09,950
Speaker 0: I'll just point out that the Scott Johnson with the hose in the middle of the winter Wow, you know surround their car with big frozen blocks of ice so they can't drive it out.

163
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,592
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

164
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:16,190
Speaker 1: much more clever is to replace someone's car with a very similar car.

165
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:17,546
Speaker 0: That's a good one, too.

166
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:23,644
Speaker 0: But anyway and put their car on the other side of the schools They have to walk through a mile in the cold snow to get to it.

167
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:31,990
Speaker 1: Oh No, yes, actually to me the best pranks are the psychological ones that last for months and you build up to some climax.

168
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:41,984
Speaker 1: but the climax is sometimes so anti climactic like got like Penn's thing where they had the friend who had the Gas efficient car and he was like it was a hybrid.

169
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,873
Speaker 1: He's like, oh man, I got my hybrid I'm saving the earth.

170
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:47,610
Speaker 1: So every couple of nights they put like an extra gallon again.

171
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,050
Speaker 0: That was a good one because eventually he ran out of gas on the highway.

172
00:11:51,381 --> 00:11:58,610
Speaker 0: No Cuz when they stopped filling his car with gas he ran out and then you laugh at his suffering of not having any gas.

173
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,655
Speaker 1: That's not that bad.

174
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:02,750
Speaker 1: But your idea would be and then the car blows up because of the pipe.

175
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,578
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't need to blow up.

176
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,121
Speaker 0: You just need.

177
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,010
Speaker 0: you just needs to run out of gas on the highway.

178
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:09,059
Speaker 1: Ah, I gotta say though.

179
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,650
Speaker 1: I'll say this on Tuesday because I don't want to say it on Wednesday.

180
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:12,613
Speaker 0: How come?

181
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:17,050
Speaker 1: no one is acted like they're gonna do a cosplay skit and then just Rick rolled the audience.

182
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:22,435
Speaker 0: Because that that's about to happen at every convention this year Played out.

183
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:23,359
Speaker 0: We'll see.

184
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:28,087
Speaker 0: I guarantee that at every anime convention There'll be at least one cosplay that involves a Rick roll.

185
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:28,490
Speaker 0: somehow.

186
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:31,523
Speaker 1: See the thing is just involving Rick roll is Nick's.

187
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:36,930
Speaker 1: remember they make you do the like Performance ahead of time and you don't get to do your audio to real anime cons.

188
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:42,610
Speaker 1: You give it to the con ahead of time and they play it over the speakers with no control from you during your skit.

189
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:43,275
Speaker 0: Right.

190
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:48,019
Speaker 1: There's no way for you Easily to make the Rick roll sound

191
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:58,914
Speaker 0: happen because the the convention will hear it Which is means you pretty much have to do a Rick roll skit and then the convention Runners and the other cosplayers will know you're doing it But no one else will know

192
00:12:59,014 --> 00:12:59,135
Speaker 1: that.

193
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:08,024
Speaker 1: the best way is to either one have one man on the inside who does it Like the guy who does the audio is the only one who knows if you pay him off.

194
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:09,188
Speaker 0: That's a that's a good trick.

195
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:14,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, or secret speaker Secret speaker is also a good trick.

196
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,351
Speaker 0: Of course, it's hard to overpower the sound system It's.

197
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:19,770
Speaker 1: um, although the sound system itself you say my ours is a silent skit.

198
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:27,252
Speaker 1: That's how you do that good one See.

199
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:31,789
Speaker 1: and then of course your version of that is and then I bring out a tire iron and I kill the M's.

200
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,008
Speaker 0: well, no, what I would do is I would you know and have some sort of right cosplay.

201
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:42,250
Speaker 0: right and You know, I'd have a bunch of people but one person who is in the cosplay actually with us.

202
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:49,704
Speaker 0: You know The rest of us would know everything that was gonna happen and they would only know most of what was gonna happen and then maybe Like cover them with paint or something paint.

203
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:50,610
Speaker 0: I don't know something.

204
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,726
Speaker 1: God You know remind me to never let you pull a prank ever God.

205
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,835
Speaker 1: Anyway, what are you on the news?

206
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:01,385
Speaker 0: Ah, so being here a fool's day.

207
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:02,790
Speaker 0: It was not easy to find real news.

208
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,360
Speaker 0: I mean, I could have just looked at yesterday's news.

209
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,869
Speaker 0: That's what I did, but I was lazy.

210
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:16,349
Speaker 0: Actually, I've been wanting to talk about this all week Yeah, but anyway, there was one news that came out today that seems to be corroborated on multiple websites So I'll trust this as a true news.

211
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:30,310
Speaker 0: The news says that Ubisoft or Ubisoft or whatever you want to call it is gonna put a lot of their games Such as the Assassin's Creed's and the Far Cry's on Steam and that's you know, I guess it's a big news if you're a fan of those games.

212
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:40,470
Speaker 0: But really what this says to me is something that I semi predicted long ago Is that Steam is now becoming pretty much synonymous with high-end PC gaming.

213
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:53,520
Speaker 0: High-end PC gaming and Steam are like one in the same now Microsoft games for Windows and you know there I guess there was some sort of attempt to sort of mix the Xbox Live and Windows Vista in some way but that doesn't seem to be doing it.

214
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:00,565
Speaker 0: Steam seems to be where it's at and I really think you know since PC games are just not on the shelves at stores anymore.

215
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:08,435
Speaker 0: Really I think Valve Steam is pretty much gonna be the PC gaming source for the foreseeable future.

216
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:10,521
Speaker 1: I could see eventually.

217
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,063
Speaker 1: this is still.

218
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:17,677
Speaker 1: I think that what Steam what they should do is sell Steam as an operating system.

219
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:25,260
Speaker 0: they should they should but the only problem with Steam is that it only runs on Windows PCs and Not so much on Macs and Linux.

220
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,290
Speaker 0: and I there's so a vert.

221
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,054
Speaker 0: I guess it's so.

222
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:32,615
Speaker 0: a lot of the software is so heavily based in DirectX You know which is very.

223
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:37,130
Speaker 0: there's no blaming them for that because it is really easy to make high-end 3d games and direct.

224
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:49,264
Speaker 1: Like a lot of people I've said in the past Why don't you make like a virtual machine like I'll run on anything and I've actually been dealing with VMware because that no really hurt video card type performance action.

225
00:15:49,304 --> 00:16:01,516
Speaker 1: if you do that beyond all that I've been actually working with some higher up engineers at VMware and with other Virtualization solutions, and I can tell you this Clock timekeeping.

226
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:04,250
Speaker 1: and when I say timekeeping, I don't just mean your clock is accurate.

227
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,610
Speaker 1: I mean like the ticks you cannot have accurate time.

228
00:16:09,393 --> 00:16:12,789
Speaker 1: No accurate time means no video games.

229
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much so but really that's the only thing wrong with steam is it's limited to just Windows.

230
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,784
Speaker 0: And of course Windows is still number one in terms of numbers.

231
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:23,050
Speaker 0: So it's not a big problem.

232
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,241
Speaker 1: But for now, there's a really on the horizon.

233
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:27,170
Speaker 0: the Macs are getting crazy popular.

234
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:27,993
Speaker 0: Right?

235
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:30,744
Speaker 0: Linux is you know more popular than it's ever been.

236
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,055
Speaker 0: it's it's significant even you know If it's not big.

237
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,510
Speaker 1: they could sell the steam hardware.

238
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:42,030
Speaker 1: It's a steam computer with steam OS and you can subscribe to periodic hardware updates.

239
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:44,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is that would be a lot of money.

240
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,209
Speaker 0: You see that's that's the problem really with gaming.

241
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,886
Speaker 0: Is that a gaming PC is a lot of money like that at least $1,500, right?

242
00:16:52,370 --> 00:17:05,970
Speaker 0: So if you're spending that kind of money and all it does is play games you feel like a moron because For a lot less money, you could have gotten a ps3 or an Xbox 360 Which is still a lot of money which just plays games and maybe does a few more things.

243
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:13,087
Speaker 0: So if you're paying out for a PC You want it to still be able to do everything a PC can do because you're paying so much for in steam.

244
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:16,949
Speaker 1: you could run VMware to run Windows stuff.

245
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:21,470
Speaker 0: I guess they had to sell you a Windows license with your steam or just they could get bra.

246
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,856
Speaker 1: I mean, what do you need nowadays?

247
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:24,703
Speaker 1: You need web browser?

248
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:29,418
Speaker 0: Yeah word processor Can't even need word processor because you have Google Docs.

249
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:32,047
Speaker 1: Well, I'm talking about normal people not cool people.

250
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:35,802
Speaker 1: Google Docs Anyway, plus until Google Docs is fully integrated with Google Gears.

251
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:37,690
Speaker 1: I still need a word process.

252
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,657
Speaker 0: They really got to integrate that Google Gears more.

253
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:40,660
Speaker 0: That's like.

254
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,490
Speaker 0: but yeah, that's the only thing that's wrong with steam.

255
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:52,777
Speaker 0: And other than that steam in terms of PC gaming I think that's it's where it's gonna be at for a long time and they've pretty much Conquered the PC gaming world.

256
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:56,893
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I ever it really what let him do it, too Was that portal action?

257
00:17:56,933 --> 00:18:02,430
Speaker 0: because before then steam was really just a thing for all the counter-strike peoples, you know in the half-life peoples.

258
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,157
Speaker 1: I remember when steam first came out.

259
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:05,763
Speaker 1: it sucked and was hated.

260
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:06,567
Speaker 1: It was awful.

261
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:07,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, why is it good?

262
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,450
Speaker 0: Well, yeah had problems.

263
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:11,440
Speaker 0: I never had problems with it But a lot of other people did and I won't deny that they.

264
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,557
Speaker 1: early on when it came out for a lot of people It was basically on here.

265
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:19,747
Speaker 1: I'm like the only person who never had problems with steam Yeah, but you also didn't play as many games as a lot of people.

266
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:20,230
Speaker 0: That's true.

267
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:26,341
Speaker 0: I mostly just played valves games and and mods like natural selection, but Yeah, oh, well.

268
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:33,049
Speaker 1: Well speaking of steam I know you all know I've bitched about this a bunch of times but that they're updating Team Fortress 2 now.

269
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:34,593
Speaker 1: Part of this.

270
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,523
Speaker 1: if you notice not many people are playing Team Fortress 2 anymore.

271
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:41,050
Speaker 1: That game did not win by any stretch.

272
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:56,985
Speaker 1: But the thing that they've been saying they're gonna go forward with is that they're gonna have Unlockable content as in if you get 20 achievements on the medic you unlock Extra medic guns and this is coming closer to reality.

273
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:01,262
Speaker 1: and it looks like in a couple of weeks We're gonna see the first bits of this.

274
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:10,049
Speaker 1: and I'm starting to worry but not worry too much because I tried to play Team Fortress 2 the other day and I remembered Oh, yeah, it's not the greatest game in the world.

275
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:12,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I'm not.

276
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:19,709
Speaker 0: I'm playing Smash Brothers now and in a and then I'm gonna be playing Mario Kart and somewhere in there I'm getting the rondo of swords.

277
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:35,597
Speaker 1: So not so interested in Team Fortress 2 really but I'll say this my main complaint My main worry was alright, so you're gonna let people with crap metagame stuff unlock permanent things They can use in-game that have an effect.

278
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,290
Speaker 1: So in this interview, I found someone asked a question quote.

279
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:39,912
Speaker 1: It was IGN.

280
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:48,110
Speaker 1: actually if some players are running around with unlocked items and some aren't How are you taking steps to assure that gameplay remains balanced between classes?

281
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,290
Speaker 1: They basically said well all the new weapons are mostly balanced with each other.

282
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:56,924
Speaker 1: As in it's all about options.

283
00:19:56,984 --> 00:20:03,329
Speaker 1: you have more options But they're balanced options like instead of getting invulnerability you get a hundred percent crit rate.

284
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:07,890
Speaker 1: great and Yeah, I don't want to get into this.

285
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,722
Speaker 1: I've talked about this a bunch but I think this is a crap move.

286
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:14,702
Speaker 1: and the worst thing is they kind of ask him like So why are you doing this?

287
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:15,889
Speaker 1: They basically talk about up?

288
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,810
Speaker 1: Well, this is the future gaming and this seems to be what people want.

289
00:20:19,374 --> 00:20:28,012
Speaker 0: well, you know you look at it right and you look at numbers and sales and games that do have this sort of Persistence.

290
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:31,863
Speaker 0: or you know collecting Pokemon World of Warcraft.

291
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:33,287
Speaker 1: It's great for me.

292
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:34,310
Speaker 0: That's what the money's at.

293
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,677
Speaker 0: So that's where everyone's going.

294
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:38,451
Speaker 0: and I think you know, they made Team Fortress 2.

295
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:39,595
Speaker 0: They didn't have that stuff.

296
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:44,030
Speaker 0: their game sorta, you know, I mean, I guess it did well, but it mostly rode on portal.

297
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:47,889
Speaker 0: You know, no one not really as many people are playing it as you know.

298
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:56,802
Speaker 0: Ten years of waiting and the awesome style and all the hype and effort they put into it, you know should mean I mean, I don't have numbers but looking at just what.

299
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:58,569
Speaker 1: so how many people are on what servers?

300
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:02,610
Speaker 1: ah More people were playing counter-strike.

301
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:04,617
Speaker 1: My people are still playing counter-strike.

302
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:07,528
Speaker 1: then we're playing Team Fortress even in some of its peak days.

303
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:10,590
Speaker 1: Yep But I don't want to talk about that.

304
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,109
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about all these problems.

305
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:18,386
Speaker 1: But I point out that I've seen a couple of references to the fact that they're now going to start releasing more of those.

306
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:19,510
Speaker 1: meet the whatever videos.

307
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:28,790
Speaker 1: I've seen multiple sources state that meet the scout is coming And I realized what those were and why they made a few and then they stopped making them.

308
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:33,065
Speaker 1: So I got a six shooter and I'm gonna shoot Scott, you know, it's a prank.

309
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:33,748
Speaker 1: It's April 1st.

310
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:34,230
Speaker 1: It's a prank.

311
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,014
Speaker 1: I'm gonna prank him.

312
00:21:35,316 --> 00:21:37,087
Speaker 1: Yep, so I shot him twice in the head.

313
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:44,050
Speaker 1: Oh Now I could have kept shooting and emptied my gun But I got these bullets and he might die of those two gunshot wounds.

314
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:49,590
Speaker 1: So I'm just gonna keep those bullets and if the game does well, I don't need to even bother firing.

315
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,796
Speaker 1: I can keep him for another day.

316
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:56,049
Speaker 1: But if the game starts to falter zombies God's back from the grave.

317
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,555
Speaker 0: That's a good prank.

318
00:21:57,735 --> 00:22:01,086
Speaker 0: Just ram sleeping at night thinks I'm dead zombies.

319
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:04,457
Speaker 0: God comes and eats his brain Doesn't see it coming.

320
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:06,510
Speaker 1: I can start firing off more of those bullets.

321
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,146
Speaker 1: Now the problem here is that what I see that it's kind of like my thing about Hillary Clinton.

322
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:22,230
Speaker 1: now the news I talked about last week wasn't a big deal in and of itself But the kind of reading between the lines was that Hillary's campaign is stalled and this is like the last chance grasping at straws.

323
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:27,826
Speaker 1: But I see valve is going down the same route here with Team Fortress 2.

324
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:29,330
Speaker 0: I also see the same route.

325
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:30,490
Speaker 0: They're basically saying shit.

326
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,236
Speaker 0: We spent a lot on.

327
00:22:31,256 --> 00:22:32,849
Speaker 0: this game portal was a success.

328
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,957
Speaker 0: Half-life 2 kind of a success.

329
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:37,364
Speaker 0: Team Fortress 2 not a successor hoping for.

330
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:38,930
Speaker 0: let's do whatever we can to try to.

331
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:42,110
Speaker 0: You know make it into something but yet they're not doing what they need to do.

332
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:49,130
Speaker 1: I think the core problem with Team Fortress 2 was that it didn't actually target a demographic that exists.

333
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:52,370
Speaker 1: They unwanted I mean they tried to split two demographics.

334
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:54,377
Speaker 1: They wanted to be the.

335
00:22:54,678 --> 00:22:56,625
Speaker 1: you don't need a lot of FPS skills.

336
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:58,210
Speaker 1: the console gamers can play it.

337
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,173
Speaker 1: It's pick up and run.

338
00:22:59,253 --> 00:22:59,855
Speaker 1: It's simple.

339
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:09,775
Speaker 1: It's on the 360 and the ps3 and that demographic would rather play Halo Yep, and the other demographic is Hardcore.

340
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:10,881
Speaker 1: capture the flag.

341
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,570
Speaker 1: people who've been waiting for this game forever.

342
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:20,256
Speaker 1: There's no capture the flag in Team Fortress 2 worth a shit and they've released a couple more maps But by then all the hardcore people left.

343
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:22,584
Speaker 1: so no one plays those CTF maps.

344
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:24,430
Speaker 1: and what did they think to do?

345
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,347
Speaker 1: And what are they doing now?

346
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,257
Speaker 1: Gold rush a totally new mode.

347
00:23:28,277 --> 00:23:30,524
Speaker 1: We have to walk a minecart past the enemies.

348
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:32,570
Speaker 0: That was always a good idea.

349
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:38,273
Speaker 0: I thought was to have some sort of map where you drive a car and then is it's not like that I know.

350
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:42,010
Speaker 0: and then yet you had to sorta remember they made what was that one in half-life one?

351
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,724
Speaker 0: With that with the vans and that everyone got in the trucks.

352
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,529
Speaker 0: Well, there was just Yeah Jeep a thon that's it.

353
00:23:48,431 --> 00:23:49,580
Speaker 1: 2k man, you know what?

354
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:59,230
Speaker 1: I realized something Hardcore like you can tell the hardcore FPS gamer kind of like the hardcore anime fan Playing Jeep a thon was like watching Excel saga.

355
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:09,181
Speaker 1: Like if you're not already a fan of FPS is or already a fan of anime That means nothing to you and is not fun He put on is like the best hat Counter-Strike map ever.

356
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:11,710
Speaker 1: Jeep a thon was like this broken ass man.

357
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:16,986
Speaker 0: I remember driving up that ramp and half the time that you would just kill yourself.

358
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:17,649
Speaker 1: It looked like shit.

359
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:18,672
Speaker 1: It wasn't.

360
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:21,301
Speaker 1: but at the same time it embodied that hardcore.

361
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:22,847
Speaker 1: It's like it was.

362
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:23,489
Speaker 1: it was art.

363
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:28,050
Speaker 1: It was art and it was the same as the ready room and natural selection.

364
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:38,070
Speaker 0: I mean in a way right that the vehicles in more modern FPS is such as halo and unreal tournament and such are much better implemented than the vehicles in half-life 1.

365
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:44,302
Speaker 0: Yes, but there was something about the way Jeep a thon worked where that is the absolute best.

366
00:24:44,703 --> 00:25:00,784
Speaker 0: one guy drives the Humvee and Three guys sit in the Humvee shooting out the windows at the other people in the other Humvee shooting out the windows Game that has ever existed and I mean also like remember the APC On on assault or it wasn't assault was it?

367
00:25:00,885 --> 00:25:01,790
Speaker 1: it was one of those rare.

368
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,949
Speaker 0: I mean the one where you have to break into the base over the bridge but yet half the time you get in the APC and you start driving.

369
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:10,084
Speaker 0: and What the hell was that map call?

370
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:10,950
Speaker 0: that map doesn't exist.

371
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,858
Speaker 1: No It doesn't.

372
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:16,610
Speaker 1: but half the time You'd get in the APC and the driver would just back it up against the wall.

373
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,910
Speaker 1: So no, you could get out and then jump up and down on top of it until the enemies came and grenaded you to test.

374
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:35,273
Speaker 1: It's a thing of beauty, but it was more than like the community around the game would support that kind of meta barely gaming more like collaborative Experienced.

375
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:41,450
Speaker 1: it's hard to explain what was good about that And I'm not claiming that that was great in terms of gameplay by any stretch.

376
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:58,265
Speaker 1: But Team Fortress 2 didn't really capitalize on that and they didn't capitalize on the hardcore FPS capture the flag Which was like the basis of why I was looking forward to that game and the lack of it was the reason I stopped playing Though I can say this I played over the weekend for like 20 minutes.

377
00:25:58,646 --> 00:25:59,690
Speaker 1: I joined a random server.

378
00:26:00,353 --> 00:26:07,458
Speaker 1: It was 15 on 15 like one of those big old in an awesome mat and It the game been going for like 20 minutes.

379
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:08,202
Speaker 1: No time limit.

380
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:10,190
Speaker 1: No sudden death and it was zero to zero.

381
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,789
Speaker 1: I just turned into a scout and captured the flag three times.

382
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,125
Speaker 0: Immediately sounds about right?

383
00:26:16,468 --> 00:26:17,934
Speaker 1: Yeah That was bragging.

384
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:21,327
Speaker 0: but I feel proud about that because the problem is a lot of people play that game.

385
00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:23,650
Speaker 0: the way they play is They say I want to do this role.

386
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:29,310
Speaker 0: So they pick the role they want to do say sniper and then you just sit there and snipe and then they don't do anything.

387
00:26:29,412 --> 00:26:31,856
Speaker 0: They don't think about the flag They don't think and then someone else's.

388
00:26:31,876 --> 00:26:32,760
Speaker 0: I want to be the engineers.

389
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,737
Speaker 0: they sit there and they set up their thing and they maintain It and that's all they do now.

390
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:39,930
Speaker 0: and that because that's sort of that World of Warcraft style play.

391
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,255
Speaker 0: I want to be the healer.

392
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:45,912
Speaker 0: you just sit there and you pay attention to your little healing and you just heal as best You can.

393
00:26:45,932 --> 00:26:48,903
Speaker 0: you don't think about the big picture winning the game or anything like that.

394
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:52,542
Speaker 0: You know sitting there doing busy work That's fine for games that kind of.

395
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:54,635
Speaker 1: I mean for World of Warcraft Like you want it.

396
00:26:54,877 --> 00:27:01,664
Speaker 1: letting everyone do exactly what they want to do works But for a game like Team Fortress, it works for the casual gamer.

397
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:03,650
Speaker 1: doesn't work for the hardcore gamer.

398
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:13,489
Speaker 1: it's all the hardcore FPS people to even bother with the game and all the casual people left and The the thing I really want to point out at the end of this interview because this is a question.

399
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,609
Speaker 1: This says everything.

400
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:20,467
Speaker 1: Question will the console versions ever see these updates?

401
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:24,984
Speaker 1: No Answer we're still trying to figure that out.

402
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:33,016
Speaker 1: Yep right now We're working on a map pack that we hope will contain gold rush and the rest of the math We've shipped to the PC customers so far.

403
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:34,702
Speaker 0: Yeah map pack they can do.

404
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:41,406
Speaker 0: they've done map packs on the 360 before So there should be no reason why they can't do one now, but anything else.

405
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,630
Speaker 0: I don't know if they can be able to do that.

406
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:44,689
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm sort of on a disc.

407
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:53,210
Speaker 1: I think we need to set up some sort of all the old school FPSers versus the rest of the forum on Team Fortress 2 on a private server.

408
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:55,859
Speaker 0: Are we gonna tell who's the old school who's not?

409
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,809
Speaker 1: I think we will do the Turing test one by one.

410
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,115
Speaker 1: Well, well, you're like.

411
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:03,127
Speaker 1: we'll chat with each of you individually and I'll be.

412
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:03,850
Speaker 0: that's all you.

413
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,417
Speaker 0: I don't have time for that pretty much.

414
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:08,090
Speaker 1: It's have you ever played any of the following games?

415
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,493
Speaker 1: action quick to counter-strike 1.6.

416
00:28:11,493 --> 00:28:21,058
Speaker 0: Yeah weapons factory I tried to play some counters like 1.6 last week and just as the getting was good everyone quit Like I sucked.

417
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:26,730
Speaker 0: cuz I parent I haven't played the game in years But I was getting it back and then everyone quit but there's one guy obviously cheating.

418
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,164
Speaker 0: So the vat the the the vac thing is not up to snuff really.

419
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:33,050
Speaker 0: it's still possible to cheat apparently.

420
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:47,576
Speaker 1: Anyway things of the day, so, you know They were coming and I love the fact that now we have the YouTube generation.

421
00:28:47,636 --> 00:28:48,560
Speaker 1: We can see him right away.

422
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:49,503
Speaker 1: I don't know.

423
00:28:49,523 --> 00:28:50,125
Speaker 1: the thing is though.

424
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:54,619
Speaker 1: How come the YouTube generation doesn't know how to use the frickin video out of their?

425
00:28:54,879 --> 00:29:04,395
Speaker 1: we Don't know why was every video capture cards but Anyway, there's so many ways to do this.

426
00:29:04,596 --> 00:29:15,616
Speaker 1: if you have a camera Oh, this is not an April Fool's Day, by the way, if you have a camera kid Alright cameras always almost always video cameras also have a video.

427
00:29:15,717 --> 00:29:21,639
Speaker 1: in autumn a lot of them do So you could have just pla anyway, so this video this is the best one out there.

428
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:24,680
Speaker 1: There's a glitch that has already been found in brawl.

429
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:27,660
Speaker 0: Well, you remember Smash Brothers Melee had a glitch with the black hole.

430
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:28,807
Speaker 1: It had a couple of glitches.

431
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:30,679
Speaker 1: the black hole was my favorite one by far.

432
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:33,916
Speaker 1: But this glitch is basically.

433
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:46,099
Speaker 1: So if you take jigglypuff, there's a couple of things I don't think people have figured out all of the things that will do this yet that will cause him to double in size suddenly and permanently.

434
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:51,435
Speaker 0: Well, you mean using his final smash makes him like no well it's complicated.

435
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:55,229
Speaker 1: this final smash makes him grow but there must be some sort of kind of like.

436
00:29:55,249 --> 00:30:02,421
Speaker 1: how if you add a bold tag and forget to unbold it or You add an unbold tag, but there's no bold tag in front of it Like.

437
00:30:02,643 --> 00:30:05,940
Speaker 1: or you have a paren that opened something but you forget to have the clothes paren.

438
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,319
Speaker 1: So now you've got like all these friends that are out of sync if a certain thing happens.

439
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:23,700
Speaker 1: Something like that must have happened with jigglypuff because if you interrupt his final smash in any way or If you cancel it and then certain things happen, you'll double in size.

440
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:29,839
Speaker 0: Well, if you use if you do with the final smash, it looks like he'll remain at final smash size.

441
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:33,359
Speaker 0: But there's another trick with Yoshi that will double his size.

442
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:38,177
Speaker 1: So this video outlines both of those and then they do what.

443
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:40,684
Speaker 1: all you're all thinking What if I combine them?

444
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:46,040
Speaker 1: and the answer is it doubles the size whatever the size may be.

445
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Speaker 0: So when he's if you make a jigglypuff really small and then do the trick He'll be the same size small but times two.

446
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,978
Speaker 1: So if he already takes up half the screen and then you do the trick whoa?

447
00:30:57,018 --> 00:31:08,800
Speaker 1: now yes, now the the interesting thing to note is that it appears that double size jigglypuff is Absolutely useless and furthermore is no more powerful than any normal jigglypuff.

448
00:31:09,963 --> 00:31:14,780
Speaker 1: But this is really cool and really awesome And I love the fact that kids find these things and post videos of them.

449
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:19,934
Speaker 0: If anyone can pull this off in like a tournament like for reals You're the win man.

450
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:30,040
Speaker 1: I would I would collaborate with other people like at a team tournament get Yoshi jigglypuff combo and then you know Just collaborate with a bunch of people and be like if we face each other.

451
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,368
Speaker 1: Let's do it kind of like those two guys.

452
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:35,117
Speaker 1: then ping-pong tournament with that one round of just crazy hilarity.

453
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:37,329
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, just like that.

454
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:38,577
Speaker 1: But anyway, what do you got for me?

455
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:48,436
Speaker 0: Okay, so You know back in the day There's a kind of game to play on the web right where you know I mean lately the big thing has been flash games tower defense kind of stuff, right?

456
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:51,539
Speaker 0: That's well and good But there's a style of web game.

457
00:31:51,861 --> 00:32:02,800
Speaker 0: It's actually a style of game that's been around since the BBS days where it's a game that you sort of check in on Once in a while like the game is literally always going but it goes very slowly.

458
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:06,360
Speaker 0: So imagine like an RTS where your guys walk real slow.

459
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:11,016
Speaker 0: Well, you can walk away from it for like a few hours and come back and walk away and come back.

460
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:22,725
Speaker 0: and since it's so slow you just sort of when you come back you sort of do all your stuff and then you walk away and you can you know You can even forget about it for a day or two and then come back and it's still okay, you know you can't get killed.

461
00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:24,996
Speaker 0: so instantly cuz everyone else is going really slowly.

462
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,305
Speaker 0: also and Basically, there's a website.

463
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:30,073
Speaker 0: I found e carry him.

464
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:31,440
Speaker 0: I think it or I carry him.

465
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,405
Speaker 0: I don't know how to correct pronunciation.

466
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:35,169
Speaker 0: That's I K AR.

467
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:41,800
Speaker 0: I am dot org and it's basically a simplified version of civilization.

468
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:48,680
Speaker 0: But you know play it on the web and you only have to check in like once or twice a day Maybe and you'll be just fine.

469
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:55,050
Speaker 1: I played a game like this and so did Scott and everyone else in the crew And our IT was sort of wizards and you build.

470
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,535
Speaker 0: that one was pretty much just like.

471
00:32:56,716 --> 00:33:00,680
Speaker 0: you have ten nights You know and he just had the word nights and the number ten gaga.

472
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,147
Speaker 0: This one actually looks like civilization.

473
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:07,720
Speaker 0: there's graphics and the user interface and the whole thing and it's really slick and it's free.

474
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:08,483
Speaker 0: There's that.

475
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:09,185
Speaker 0: there's a mode.

476
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:10,350
Speaker 0: you can pay for like.

477
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:16,069
Speaker 0: I carry them plus but I'm not paying for that And we're I'm on the Zeta server.

478
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:18,920
Speaker 0: So everyone who I told already followed me to the Zeta server.

479
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,640
Speaker 0: I chose the Zeta server at completely arbitrarily.

480
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:26,420
Speaker 0: So if there's actually a difference between the servers we can you know, maybe fix that or something.

481
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:32,360
Speaker 0: But our plan is to make a giant alliance on the Zeta server and conquer the whole server at least as much as possible.

482
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:34,645
Speaker 0: Hmm, we'll see that'll probably take a while.

483
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:41,687
Speaker 0: My current short-term strategy is basically I'm upgrading my Academy and nothing else and trying to get All the science.

484
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:52,159
Speaker 0: So once I get all the science then I'll be able to like just upgrade my place crazily to full-on and then Build a giant army and slowly conquer everything near me.

485
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:53,882
Speaker 0: That's my.

486
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:55,408
Speaker 0: that's my strategy for the.

487
00:33:55,428 --> 00:33:57,757
Speaker 1: I have yet to even look at this game.

488
00:33:58,038 --> 00:33:58,660
Speaker 1: I didn't have time.

489
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,229
Speaker 1: I was actually working at work.

490
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, you may you may or may not enjoy it.

491
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:10,609
Speaker 0: You know, this is the kind of thing where I'll probably log into it in the morning I'll admit log into it maybe at lunch and log into it You know, maybe don't when I get home don't misplace my.

492
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,355
Speaker 1: I haven't tried it yet with cynicism.

493
00:34:12,795 --> 00:34:13,960
Speaker 1: I love games like this.

494
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,654
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just most of the games like this aren't always that good.

495
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:19,844
Speaker 1: But the thing is it's not Is so little.

496
00:34:20,065 --> 00:34:26,322
Speaker 0: yeah, there are already some problems with it that I'm that I'm starting to detect and that you know They're pretty much.

497
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:36,704
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into it now, but this is you know, it's it's at least gonna occupy You know the the the attention of some people's for at least a few weeks I'm assuming.

498
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:39,594
Speaker 0: so get in it while strike while the iron's hot.

499
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:41,219
Speaker 1: Well, actually I played that mage.

500
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,072
Speaker 1: It was like the ascension or something.

501
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:44,120
Speaker 1: I forget what it was exactly.

502
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,264
Speaker 0: I think I might have played something called anarchy but I don't remember.

503
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:50,877
Speaker 1: all I remember is that I decided to be like white magic and I was.

504
00:34:51,058 --> 00:35:04,260
Speaker 1: I was very defensive and my people were prosperous and my goal was not to expand or engage in like the crazy PvP, but to Expand slowly and moderately and then just have this gigantic perfectly stable utterly defensible Kingdom.

505
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:09,200
Speaker 1: And then I found out that they periodically just reset the game and make everyone start over and then I just quit.

506
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,384
Speaker 0: No, screw that shit.

507
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:14,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I'm gonna have a persistent world, I want a persistent goddamn world.

508
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:16,047
Speaker 0: Yes, that is.

509
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:22,294
Speaker 0: one thing is that this is sort of like it's civilization But every you know, every city in town is owned by someone.

510
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:29,501
Speaker 0: if you attack someone's gonna You know come home at night log in for five minutes and they're gonna see Scott is attacking you and they're gonna be like that Fucker.

511
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:34,297
Speaker 1: also the the way of doling out resources and time and that sort of thing.

512
00:35:34,939 --> 00:35:46,174
Speaker 1: in general I'd like to do a show on game mechanics or like different collaborative or multiplayer game mechanics because this is one very Underutilized mechanic that has great promise like good God.

513
00:35:46,214 --> 00:35:47,780
Speaker 1: Could you do awesome things with this idea?

514
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,874
Speaker 1: But mostly people have made very simple games so far.

515
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:53,552
Speaker 0: Yep Alright, you want to get on with the show?

516
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:56,620
Speaker 1: I think we can All right, so you have a little more venom in you than me about this.

517
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,020
Speaker 0: You can introduce the time some venoms a bit.

518
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:06,531
Speaker 1: Basically, I have a little more venom because I think I invested a lot more time and money into these things than you Maybe but I invested quite a bit of time and money.

519
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:08,420
Speaker 0: I got the box of cards to prove it under my bed.

520
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:10,247
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

521
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:15,486
Speaker 1: my box of cards is in Arizona far enough away to where I'll never be tempted to play it Again, yeah, I'm never gonna be tempted.

522
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:19,220
Speaker 0: Anyway, basically we're talking about collectible games.

523
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,472
Speaker 0: Collectible card games are the most popular subset.

524
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:26,599
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about collectible games in general here.

525
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:34,239
Speaker 0: We'll probably do another show on mad just magic itself in the future But we'll both be using magic as an example quite often but also other things now.

526
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:43,895
Speaker 0: But a collectible game is is it's a game just like any other game, you know Just like Puerto Rico or anything except the pieces of that game.

527
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,120
Speaker 0: You have to collect them.

528
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,139
Speaker 0: So imagine if you are gonna play say collectible chess, right?

529
00:36:50,280 --> 00:37:00,539
Speaker 0: But everyone wasn't just always playing with the same chess pieces every time, you know one guy He was wicked rich went out on eBay and bought a full set of Queens and he just all Queens.

530
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:04,410
Speaker 0: Everyone else is playing with like mostly pawns and like.

531
00:37:04,451 --> 00:37:09,870
Speaker 0: maybe they were lucky and they had like one Queen and a few bishops You know and me and such.

532
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:12,039
Speaker 0: that's what a collectible game is.

533
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:19,511
Speaker 1: now I just want to point out that we because we have to make this clear right away because there are Games that are like this that are not actually collectible games.

534
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:20,916
Speaker 1: They're a completely different kind of game.

535
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:24,646
Speaker 0: Yes, for example Take magic gathering right?

536
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:26,150
Speaker 0: It is a collectible game.

537
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,160
Speaker 0: when you buy cards at least the official way you're buying them.

538
00:37:29,482 --> 00:37:38,040
Speaker 0: You know sort of randomly, you know And you know, there is a I guess collecting market and a collector's value to the cards and such.

539
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:50,220
Speaker 1: You know what if you and all your friends each bought one revised set one dark set and one legend set Everyone had the exact same list of cards and then you created decks and fought with each other?

540
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,610
Speaker 0: Well, that's just a customizable game.

541
00:37:52,651 --> 00:38:03,246
Speaker 0: You see because everyone is playing with the same set I mean, let's say we're playing the customizable Collectible chess, right, but we agree that all right You know, we look at everyone.

542
00:38:03,286 --> 00:38:06,916
Speaker 0: everyone has managed, you know, what chess pieces everyone has managed to collect.

543
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:08,040
Speaker 0: and we say all right everyone.

544
00:38:09,381 --> 00:38:09,883
Speaker 0: You know you.

545
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:14,560
Speaker 0: you can have these sets of pieces and then make you know pick whichever ones you want from these.

546
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:20,505
Speaker 0: So no one can make a full set of Queens even if they own them because we're gonna you know Arbitrarily limit you in this case.

547
00:38:20,546 --> 00:38:30,840
Speaker 0: So in that case you can actually preserve and have a good Customizable game where people can customize what they're using to play the game.

548
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,286
Speaker 0: But it's still not the.

549
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:36,514
Speaker 0: the influence of it being collectible doesn't ruin the game.

550
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:38,900
Speaker 1: part now the smart kids who play magic.

551
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:52,980
Speaker 1: I don't know how it is now because there's so many cards that I've got the fact that magic is still going and that they have actually plotted out every expansion that's gonna be released through like 2012 when I guess they didn't go beyond that because that's when gets the Guadal is gonna kick everyone's ass, right?

552
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:59,333
Speaker 1: But The The fucking magic.

553
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:02,329
Speaker 1: Yeah But the smart kids did.

554
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:03,153
Speaker 1: I lost my train of thought.

555
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:06,066
Speaker 1: I was trying to cover that up But was that what I did?

556
00:39:06,086 --> 00:39:14,940
Speaker 1: what a lot of us did is we would take land and we write Mox emerald or black Lotus on them and we'd still follow the rules for creation.

557
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:36,591
Speaker 1: But if we didn't own a card We would do that so that we could play with these cards because otherwise the rich kid who bought Great wall of magic, which literally was just every wall ever released in magic up to that point I also ended up acquiring that at some point because guy was stupid and That was also before the internet where you couldn't just look up all the awesome old car

558
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:39,219
Speaker 0: as he gets cry magazine to get.

559
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:42,408
Speaker 1: That's the whole show in and of itself.

560
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:42,890
Speaker 1: Yes.

561
00:39:43,051 --> 00:39:44,457
Speaker 1: Remember magic the conquering?

562
00:39:44,477 --> 00:39:50,220
Speaker 1: no Oh, it was a basically was a way to play magic on a board where you move the creatures around.

563
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,770
Speaker 0: But there are other sorts of collectible games like that.

564
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,033
Speaker 0: don't have this problem.

565
00:39:56,053 --> 00:39:58,218
Speaker 0: for example take a war hammer.

566
00:39:58,238 --> 00:40:04,347
Speaker 0: right war hammer is collectible, you know, but the thing is is You know exactly what you're buying.

567
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:07,559
Speaker 0: you go to the store and you say I want five of those and ten of those.

568
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:14,440
Speaker 0: now The thing is there's still a matter of having enough money to play the game, but more money doesn't mean more winning.

569
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:18,908
Speaker 1: It does If you can't afford the pieces you want.

570
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,140
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, that's true more that there's no limit of supply.

571
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,835
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not like magic where well, you can't get a black Lotus.

572
00:40:25,855 --> 00:40:26,979
Speaker 1: There aren't any in your town.

573
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:33,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, or in the thing is a game like war hammer is actually a good game all around.

574
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:39,140
Speaker 0: It's just because it's somewhat collectible not randomly collectible, but like magic but collectible in a way.

575
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:41,269
Speaker 0: It's very expensive game.

576
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,759
Speaker 0: So basically if you have a lot of money It's a good game and you can play it.

577
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:52,540
Speaker 0: But if you don't have a lot of money You probably shouldn't play it because you can't just cost too much pieces of cardboard with you know things written on them.

578
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,411
Speaker 1: But yeah, I'll say this trying to play a war game like that.

579
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:57,560
Speaker 1: You might say hey the pieces are just fluff.

580
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,083
Speaker 1: They just like add color to the game.

581
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:01,387
Speaker 1: That's like saying yeah graphics are just fluff.

582
00:41:01,407 --> 00:41:07,088
Speaker 1: You don't need graphics in a game and then Imagine if half-life 2 looked like doom.

583
00:41:07,108 --> 00:41:09,575
Speaker 1: It wouldn't have been as immersive or good a game.

584
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:11,280
Speaker 1: war war hammer and all that.

585
00:41:12,082 --> 00:41:17,376
Speaker 1: I've tried to play those games with just pieces of cardboard and it's just not nearly as engaging.

586
00:41:17,396 --> 00:41:20,704
Speaker 0: and if you're gonna battle the battle Tech you can play but you.

587
00:41:20,865 --> 00:41:26,580
Speaker 0: even then you can't get too big a game going on or else it becomes unmanageable without real pieces.

588
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:39,911
Speaker 1: yeah, but I don't know how much we have to say about what's wrong with collectible games because it comes down to Basically if you spend money you can just pretty much make a better thing Or have a better chance of winning.

589
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:45,170
Speaker 1: it adds this whole meta element your Factors affect the game that have nothing to do with the game itself.

590
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,506
Speaker 1: There's kind of this real-world game of collecting now Mm-hmm.

591
00:41:49,526 --> 00:41:51,134
Speaker 0: See there is an additional thing though.

592
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:52,240
Speaker 0: Is that it is true?

593
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,280
Speaker 0: A lot of people say that like oh, it's not just whoever has the most money wins.

594
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,928
Speaker 0: Well in magic it was what.

595
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,757
Speaker 1: in magic it was magic.

596
00:41:59,777 --> 00:42:01,625
Speaker 0: in the early days It was but now it's.

597
00:42:01,706 --> 00:42:02,309
Speaker 0: it's really not.

598
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:10,440
Speaker 0: I mean Bill Gates could just buy every magic card ever But he probably still won't beat like world champions because he doesn't you know know how the game works and doesn't know how to play.

599
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,023
Speaker 1: What have you heard?

600
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:12,392
Speaker 1: someone else to make a deck for him?

601
00:42:12,432 --> 00:42:13,780
Speaker 1: The strategies are very simple.

602
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:20,042
Speaker 0: They used to sell on, you know sets to be like this is the deck the champion used last year You know.

603
00:42:20,323 --> 00:42:27,980
Speaker 0: and like you could buy this you could buy two of those give one to your friend and play against each other You know and it still would come down to be who is better.

604
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,128
Speaker 1: So well, it depends because.

605
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:34,280
Speaker 0: and randomness because it is a game of drawing cards out of a deck There is a lot of randomness.

606
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,018
Speaker 1: There's also other troubles in that.

607
00:42:36,702 --> 00:42:42,280
Speaker 1: The reason they were able to keep magic going like that was that they kind of had different kinds of tournaments.

608
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:51,860
Speaker 1: I mean when I stopped playing magic Seriously a type 2 tournament meant you could use revised fallen empires and the dark.

609
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:56,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, when I played I plan to one magic tournament and then I stopped playing magic forever.

610
00:42:58,163 --> 00:43:02,440
Speaker 0: The type 1 tournament was like you can use anything almost except for banned cards and whatnot.

611
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:04,346
Speaker 1: For me already that was type like.

612
00:43:04,366 --> 00:43:08,340
Speaker 1: that was type 0. and then type 1 was you can use everything except these restrictions.

613
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, type 2 is like you can use fourth edition and you know any.

614
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:17,355
Speaker 0: you know new cards But basically you could use still in print and available cards that normal people could get.

615
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:18,620
Speaker 1: I'm sure they've changed.

616
00:43:18,701 --> 00:43:20,900
Speaker 0: But the rules I'm sure a lot of things have changed.

617
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:29,928
Speaker 1: But the actual type 2 rules used to be you can use the most recent Normal base set and the previous two released Expansion sets and that's it.

618
00:43:30,593 --> 00:43:30,854
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

619
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:32,443
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know.

620
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:38,793
Speaker 0: The thing is is that collectible gaming it sort of has, you know I've done a collecting rant on the show before.

621
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:39,940
Speaker 0: I don't know what episode it was.

622
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,180
Speaker 0: I could do it again in the future perhaps revise it in some ways.

623
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:52,313
Speaker 0: But basically, you know when I was a kid my dad would you know occasionally bring home like, you know Some baseball cards or something, you know, and it was fun.

624
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:53,438
Speaker 0: I liked it when I was a kid.

625
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:56,698
Speaker 0: and then Like I sometimes I get like a sticker book.

626
00:43:57,041 --> 00:44:03,179
Speaker 0: You get like a book and you get a pack of stickers and the stickers are on cards and like each card had two stickers It was like a pack of cards.

627
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:07,922
Speaker 0: but really it was like a whole bunch of stickers and you put them in the book and you would try to fill the whole Book.

628
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:09,168
Speaker 0: and you know, it was.

629
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,520
Speaker 0: it was sort of fun and like I had like a little collect.

630
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:13,940
Speaker 0: I wasn't like a super collector when I was a kid, you know.

631
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:19,380
Speaker 0: But you know, I like to put like the baseball cards in order had a little bit of OCD action going on.

632
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:25,020
Speaker 1: You know, I had a green binder a blue binder a black binder a white binder.

633
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,110
Speaker 0: Well, you went all out.

634
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,034
Speaker 0: I just have a box.

635
00:44:28,316 --> 00:44:29,582
Speaker 0: I still have the same box I use.

636
00:44:29,602 --> 00:44:34,475
Speaker 1: the cards were organized by type and then within type alphabetically.

637
00:44:35,624 --> 00:44:36,740
Speaker 0: You went way more than I did.

638
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:44,641
Speaker 0: I just sort of you know Organized them by color green white red blue black in order of how much I like the fact that I needed the gold binder Cuz.

639
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:47,014
Speaker 1: I had enough gold cards from like legends and all that.

640
00:44:47,035 --> 00:44:51,178
Speaker 0: I didn't have that many cards and then I would sort of do it like by.

641
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:55,556
Speaker 0: I do like by type and then sort of by how good I felt they were.

642
00:44:55,596 --> 00:45:00,100
Speaker 0: like if I like my Force of nature would sort of be in the front of the green creatures, you know.

643
00:45:00,441 --> 00:45:05,003
Speaker 0: And like the like the shitty one one green creatures would be in the back You know.

644
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:07,453
Speaker 0: and then the forests and then the white cards and such.

645
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:10,969
Speaker 0: but yeah, you know I had a little OCD kind of action.

646
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:17,160
Speaker 0: I was a kid, you know, I collect the comic books You know, I sort of had to get all the issues and I keep him in order and such and everything.

647
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,154
Speaker 1: You know, I used to collect x-men cards, but I got.

648
00:45:20,235 --> 00:45:21,842
Speaker 0: I have a lot of x-men cards Under my bed.

649
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:23,447
Speaker 0: I really like those superhero cards.

650
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:25,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what those are actually really good.

651
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:28,585
Speaker 1: as much as I hate superhero comics I actually did like those cards a lot.

652
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:29,448
Speaker 1: I still have mine.

653
00:45:29,488 --> 00:45:34,325
Speaker 0: Yeah superhero cards, you know while collecting them was kind of you know That was a problem.

654
00:45:34,445 --> 00:45:37,340
Speaker 1: Hey, does anyone want to buy a full set of the foil?

655
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:43,655
Speaker 1: Special reprints from the Wolverine seasons or series - yeah, I don't need him anymore.

656
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:45,200
Speaker 0: You could probably be that shit.

657
00:45:45,604 --> 00:45:46,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I could maybe.

658
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:55,220
Speaker 0: But actually that you know Some of those cards, you know, they didn't do anything right but they had sort of like an entertainment value.

659
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:01,300
Speaker 0: Like you would read the text on the back and you would look at the art I remember trying to like, you know trace the superheroes off of the cards.

660
00:46:01,602 --> 00:46:04,104
Speaker 0: They try to learn how to draw them and stuff You know, there was.

661
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:07,079
Speaker 0: there was some merit to them at least a little bit, you know, not much.

662
00:46:07,762 --> 00:46:29,879
Speaker 0: But then as I grew older I sort of realized, you know around the time when I was actually began spending my money on these Things and not someone else's money That you know collecting was really dumb and a waste of money and and a waste of time and it was pretty much just getting enjoyment from owning something pretty much the height of materialism and consumerism and such.

663
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:31,402
Speaker 0: and Really?

664
00:46:31,442 --> 00:46:33,451
Speaker 0: What I wanted to do was play.

665
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:38,520
Speaker 0: and I realized you know I look back at what I had done with Magic the Gathering.

666
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:43,290
Speaker 0: I had done a lot more Collecting Magic the Gathering than playing like.

667
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:47,174
Speaker 0: I spent a lot of time like sitting around my room play it looking at the cards reading them.

668
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:50,348
Speaker 1: I spent a lot.

669
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:58,160
Speaker 1: I spent a lot more time like Designing decks and designing designing decks, but I never could play with those decks because the decks always needed cards.

670
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,246
Speaker 1: I didn't have yeah.

671
00:46:59,306 --> 00:47:01,015
Speaker 0: and reading magazines reading.

672
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:02,000
Speaker 0: I have a little book.

673
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,920
Speaker 0: I still have the book like how to win at magic.

674
00:47:04,142 --> 00:47:06,740
Speaker 1: I go to conventions and try to like trade man.

675
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,930
Speaker 0: There was a time when you can I had a few friends I would play with but we didn't play well And I never had you know the cards.

676
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,758
Speaker 0: I really wanted to play well, and I went to that.

677
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:16,326
Speaker 0: one time I went to that tournament right.

678
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:18,275
Speaker 0: I had a deck like planned like.

679
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:19,320
Speaker 0: I had this clever idea.

680
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:26,006
Speaker 0: I thought I was so clever when I was a punk stupid kid right and I made this little deck And I got it pretty close You know with the money I had.

681
00:47:26,026 --> 00:47:33,800
Speaker 0: you know because that was pretty much the only time I was able to buy cards Individually is that that little tournament place, and then I went I played and I just got hosed by someone.

682
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,291
Speaker 0: I actually knew what they were doing man.

683
00:47:35,372 --> 00:47:36,520
Speaker 1: I designed this awesome deck.

684
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,699
Speaker 1: It was basically I called it the Annihilator.

685
00:47:39,961 --> 00:47:42,998
Speaker 1: We'll save that for the magic show, but that deck was like the best fucking deck ever.

686
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:43,279
Speaker 1: yeah.

687
00:47:43,883 --> 00:47:51,220
Speaker 0: So you know I started that died out and then in college You know we were playing the battle tech and they came out with this mech warrior mage night.

688
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,471
Speaker 0: You know the clicks thingies.

689
00:47:52,532 --> 00:48:01,487
Speaker 1: well god I all I remember is that everyone else in the front row crew and all of our like tertiary friends not everyone Almost everyone was like hot shit.

690
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:01,929
Speaker 1: check it out.

691
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:04,740
Speaker 1: Oh my god, and I took one look at it and said that game is shit.

692
00:48:05,061 --> 00:48:06,004
Speaker 1: It's mostly random.

693
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:06,987
Speaker 1: It's not a game.

694
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:08,752
Speaker 1: look at it doesn't?

695
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:12,249
Speaker 1: it's not even battle tech this half and half next on him It's just numbers that you click.

696
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:12,935
Speaker 1: It's nothing.

697
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,367
Speaker 1: yeah Well like the only one who didn't I had played.

698
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:18,760
Speaker 1: I believe Scott himself called me stupid and not into this thing.

699
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:19,904
Speaker 0: I admit it.

700
00:48:19,945 --> 00:48:20,969
Speaker 0: I was wrong in the end.

701
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:23,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there were like I remember multiple times.

702
00:48:23,038 --> 00:48:24,323
Speaker 1: You'd be like man You're missing out.

703
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:27,236
Speaker 1: I was playing with Luke and Greg and that and then like a week later.

704
00:48:27,256 --> 00:48:30,039
Speaker 1: He's like yeah I'm done with that game.

705
00:48:30,421 --> 00:48:34,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically that the thing is with the clicks games.

706
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:38,120
Speaker 0: the clicks games are actually it's not a bad functional idea.

707
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,404
Speaker 0: Right you play a tabletop.

708
00:48:39,685 --> 00:48:46,571
Speaker 0: You know miniatures war game right except the pieces click and Sort of as they take damage.

709
00:48:46,772 --> 00:48:48,060
Speaker 0: you can actually click the pieces.

710
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,900
Speaker 0: You don't have to like keep track on a piece of paper, and it's it's much less finicky.

711
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,431
Speaker 0: And it's it's.

712
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,459
Speaker 0: it's a pretty good idea.

713
00:48:55,003 --> 00:48:59,949
Speaker 0: The thing is the way they sell those games Right like the hero clicks and the mage knight and the.

714
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:03,480
Speaker 0: whatnot is you're trying to collect the pieces and some are better than others.

715
00:49:04,383 --> 00:49:04,908
Speaker 0: it is better.

716
00:49:04,929 --> 00:49:18,234
Speaker 0: and You know we actually played the mech warrior game quite a few times because we had a lot of people going in on it And it was sort of you know that collecting bug like came and bit me again And I was like you know if I had ten more bucks as larger.

717
00:49:18,294 --> 00:49:19,560
Speaker 0: is this not buying a few more?

718
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,542
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that would be an awesome mech in the in the next little box I bought.

719
00:49:23,742 --> 00:49:28,800
Speaker 1: but then you realize that there was actually no strategy in the game other than have your tanks next to your max.

720
00:49:29,221 --> 00:49:37,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean then I actually kept playing the game enough, and I fully realized you know after a few plays Wow There's real this isn't really.

721
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:37,609
Speaker 0: um.

722
00:49:38,131 --> 00:49:44,733
Speaker 0: You know it doesn't matter what my strategy is It's pretty much just that it just kind of happens, and it's not a good game.

723
00:49:44,753 --> 00:49:48,066
Speaker 0: and even if it was a good game It was still.

724
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:58,179
Speaker 0: you know the collectible aspect of it You know also hit me like wow if I just had better mechs I would win even if my strategy was a lot dumber and even if strategy mattered.

725
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:03,319
Speaker 0: and That was like the final nail in the coffin for the collectible games for me.

726
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:07,457
Speaker 0: And I sort of went back and now I only play non collectible games.

727
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:14,746
Speaker 0: thing is Customizable games are awesome are still good, and it's the thing is a customizable game And it's very nature.

728
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:17,080
Speaker 0: think stratego is a customizable game.

729
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:21,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, we both have a set and there's a set of rules for putting your things onto the board.

730
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,384
Speaker 1: And what do you want to do?

731
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:22,887
Speaker 1: and then we play.

732
00:50:23,169 --> 00:50:25,040
Speaker 1: yeah the way I punked Scott over the weekend.

733
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:33,750
Speaker 0: I won one out of three which is and the thing is when you play a customizable game right collectible or not There is a rock-paper-scissors element to that.

734
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,100
Speaker 0: in stratego the rock-paper-scissors is very strong.

735
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,304
Speaker 1: We've done a show on Stratego.

736
00:50:37,324 --> 00:50:37,564
Speaker 1: right?

737
00:50:37,604 --> 00:50:42,620
Speaker 0: yes, okay in magic the gathering at least when I played it the rock-paper-scissors is pretty strong.

738
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:47,755
Speaker 0: you had You know COP red and the other guy had a red deck.

739
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:48,820
Speaker 0: that's rock-paper-scissors.

740
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:49,382
Speaker 0: I win.

741
00:50:49,402 --> 00:50:50,204
Speaker 0: I mean come on.

742
00:50:50,305 --> 00:50:52,472
Speaker 1: so I had the sideboard full of COP.

743
00:50:52,512 --> 00:50:53,615
Speaker 0: that was one strategy.

744
00:50:53,635 --> 00:50:55,020
Speaker 0: was the sideboard full of COPs?

745
00:50:55,482 --> 00:50:58,475
Speaker 1: I remember when I played it, and I played a tournament for so long.

746
00:50:58,576 --> 00:50:59,540
Speaker 1: I played it a non-tournament.

747
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,525
Speaker 1: I was at a friend's house.

748
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:05,369
Speaker 1: We played the first game, and then I was like all right I'm swapping four cars in my sideboard.

749
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,640
Speaker 1: He was like fuck you no sideboards.

750
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,013
Speaker 1: I was like what sideboard they punched me.

751
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,740
Speaker 0: yeah see me and all my friends.

752
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,610
Speaker 0: We you know we all read like the you know the magazine.

753
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:19,183
Speaker 0: so we sort of knew the tournament rules and played with them thinking We were all smart.

754
00:51:19,464 --> 00:51:22,736
Speaker 0: and then at the tournament the rules are actually different because we were the dumbass.

755
00:51:22,776 --> 00:51:22,936
Speaker 0: punk.

756
00:51:22,956 --> 00:51:25,095
Speaker 0: kids are behind the times with no internets.

757
00:51:26,062 --> 00:51:27,145
Speaker 1: See actually I mostly.

758
00:51:27,165 --> 00:51:29,833
Speaker 1: we had a lot of fun playing star as opposed to anything else.

759
00:51:30,294 --> 00:51:32,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think we're done.

760
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,436
Speaker 1: I think we said all we need to say about collectible games.

761
00:51:34,476 --> 00:51:34,960
Speaker 1: They're kind of poop.

762
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:40,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, collectible games not good collecting in general not so admirable not so exciting.

763
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:41,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, not really.

764
00:51:42,106 --> 00:51:43,491
Speaker 0: It's it's not worth the money.

765
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:46,020
Speaker 0: You can get a lot better gaming without collecting.

766
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,311
Speaker 0: There are a lot better ways to spend your money besides collecting.

767
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:57,520
Speaker 0: even if you're profiting from your collecting There's probably with all that time and effort you put into that you could probably be making more money with a job.

768
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,940
Speaker 0: It's it's really just bad.

769
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:09,070
Speaker 0: That's so that collectible type things have eaten up and the collecting bug has eaten up so much of geekery And it's caused a lot of side effects and other areas of geekery.

770
00:52:09,091 --> 00:52:10,416
Speaker 1: Look at anime like no one.

771
00:52:10,616 --> 00:52:15,000
Speaker 1: there aren't many anime Chachki collectors anymore and how many people actually still play magic?

772
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:21,637
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is like look collectible gaming has done significant damage to actual sort of bet.

773
00:52:21,697 --> 00:52:22,800
Speaker 0: quote better gaming.

774
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,157
Speaker 0: You know, I mean if there wasn't any collectible gaming they you know.

775
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:32,769
Speaker 1: at one hand it brought a lot of people into gaming at the same time that that argument reeks a little bit of what I heard a lot.

776
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:39,400
Speaker 1: when magic was super popular and Dungeons & Dragons people were basically saying Magic is ruining.

777
00:52:39,725 --> 00:52:46,136
Speaker 1: I try to run my game but everyone just wants to play magic instead and they all have their decks out and blah blah blah blah.

778
00:52:46,317 --> 00:52:50,918
Speaker 1: and I'm just whining because Actually, I'm a crappy DM and my players are bored and that's why they're playing magic.

779
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:55,633
Speaker 0: Yeah There is an aspect I'm not talking about there I want to do.

780
00:52:55,653 --> 00:52:57,218
Speaker 0: I'm not talking about it on the.

781
00:52:57,318 --> 00:52:57,539
Speaker 0: on the.

782
00:52:57,699 --> 00:52:59,992
Speaker 0: you know The human individual level I'm talking about.

783
00:53:00,012 --> 00:53:08,144
Speaker 0: on the industry level, you know The gaming industry has has moved in a certain direction because of the popularity and the money It can make the collectible games.

784
00:53:08,345 --> 00:53:15,890
Speaker 0: The video game industry has moved in a certain direction because of you know, the MMOs We just saw that in your in your news with you know valve and such right.

785
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:24,280
Speaker 0: the the the comic book industry has moved in A certain way because there are people collecting comic books as opposed to just caring about reading them.

786
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:30,953
Speaker 0: that's why you see the same comic book come out with three different covers because they know that some nerd will buy all three covers and they can make more money off of him.

787
00:53:31,498 --> 00:53:35,520
Speaker 0: and You know collectible gaming is damaged gaming in that same way.

788
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:46,940
Speaker 0: And yeah, it's not the happiest thing and I really even if there's a really good collectible game I do not suggest that anyone play it unless it's if it's really good.

789
00:53:47,221 --> 00:53:48,124
Speaker 0: It was really good by.

790
00:53:48,164 --> 00:53:50,312
Speaker 1: a bunch of complete sets are enough.

791
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:54,614
Speaker 0: Yeah, like we tried to do that with the penny arcade game We just bought one set and we played it.

792
00:53:54,654 --> 00:53:55,600
Speaker 0: It was a terrible game.

793
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,793
Speaker 1: That's like what I think that is in terms of dollars spent per unit.

794
00:54:00,873 --> 00:54:03,440
Speaker 1: bad the best deal ever.

795
00:54:03,722 --> 00:54:14,633
Speaker 0: if you like bad game if you like bad games, yes by the penny arcade collectible card game and Basically, it's it's fair and it's a terrible game.

796
00:54:14,673 --> 00:54:15,295
Speaker 0: and I went it.

797
00:54:15,436 --> 00:54:16,540
