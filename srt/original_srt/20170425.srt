9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:41,704
Speaker 0: but Hockey is a game and the Rangers have made it to a second round And the most.

10
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:57,001
Speaker 0: the most fascinating and wonderful thing that's happened in hockey right now is I'm sad that the Leafs didn't knock the caps out because that would have been funny, but the fact that the Predators Swept the Blackhawks is Just.

11
00:00:57,101 --> 00:01:02,720
Speaker 0: I still can't get over how funny I find that and I kind of hope the Predators push it all the way to the.

12
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:05,768
Speaker 0: now I'm kind of rooting for them over there.

13
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:06,713
Speaker 0: cuz who cares?

14
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:09,963
Speaker 0: what happens over there like About the Blues?

15
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:11,809
Speaker 0: care about the Blues the Oilers.

16
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,092
Speaker 1: No nobody can.

17
00:01:13,293 --> 00:01:14,617
Speaker 0: yeah someone cares.

18
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,559
Speaker 0: at least one person cares.

19
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:19,059
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm sure you're pretty low energy today.

20
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:20,688
Speaker 1: What's going on?

21
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:21,693
Speaker 1: It's a sad day.

22
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,963
Speaker 0: It's not that sad It's just miserable.

23
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:35,290
Speaker 0: outside and dark and cold and rainy and windy I Literally I was sitting at my desk like thinking to myself.

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,872
Speaker 0: I was having that.

25
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:44,646
Speaker 0: what I was thinking was could I Sneak into one of the conference rooms and just take like a nap What anyone notice.

26
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:45,870
Speaker 0: and I'm thinking that.

27
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,866
Speaker 0: and then Scott messaged me, and he's just like I'm so tired I almost fell asleep at my desk.

28
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:51,413
Speaker 1: I did almost fall asleep my days.

29
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:52,599
Speaker 0: It's that kind of day.

30
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:55,559
Speaker 0: So you got any news other than hockey?

31
00:01:56,639 --> 00:02:00,248
Speaker 0: Uh News yeah, there's like seven people watching now.

32
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:01,873
Speaker 1: sad seven sad seven people.

00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:06,623
Speaker 0: okay one of them is pooping though the What do you got?

34
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:11,398
Speaker 1: oh so Mario Kart 8 deluxe for a switch comes out like this week.

35
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:13,688
Speaker 1: ish Yeah, it's gonna be 50 or 60 bucks.

36
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:14,613
Speaker 1: Which is a lot of money.

37
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:16,843
Speaker 0: I thought for a minute last week I was like oh shit.

38
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:17,908
Speaker 0: I should pre-order that.

39
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:20,779
Speaker 0: and then I remembered that I'm just buying everything digital shop.

40
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:22,085
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna buy it.

41
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,676
Speaker 0: No buy it on Amazon and it all.

42
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:35,132
Speaker 0: it basically Automatically through your Nintendo account activates it and downloads it on your switch without you having to do anything And you get the Amazon discount from the Amazon credit card.

43
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:41,821
Speaker 1: okay, so it just makes the game cheaper, so This is a re-release of the Wii U Mario Kart Mario Kart 8.

44
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:49,379
Speaker 1: It's not any different, but the one notable thing is that unlike the original Mario Kart 8 for Wii U this Mario Kart?

45
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:52,594
Speaker 1: Everything is just fucking unlocked as soon as you turn the game on.

46
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:53,960
Speaker 1: you don't to unlock all this bullshit.

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,188
Speaker 1: Thank you Jesus, and it has some extra characters and stuff I think they added like Splatoon characters and stuff.

48
00:02:59,309 --> 00:02:59,790
Speaker 0: what I mean?

49
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,576
Speaker 0: you might remember we did our grind panel.

50
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:04,144
Speaker 0: I have this whole Segment about.

51
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:09,280
Speaker 0: look at all the grindy shit you have to do in Mario Kart games to unlock basic functionality.

52
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:14,433
Speaker 0: I wish super Bomberman R. Would take a page from that.

53
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:18,730
Speaker 1: yeah, so Bomberman R They made it up a patch to it.

54
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,320
Speaker 1: I haven't tried it since the patch came out.

55
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,979
Speaker 1: I think like today.

56
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:29,180
Speaker 1: Maybe the patch came out where they increased the frame rate to 60 FPS Which is great because it was sort of having problems with frame rate when we played it right?

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,800
Speaker 0: It was hard to tell because I we some of it was internet lag.

58
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were playing it online with our man.

59
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,053
Speaker 1: I definitely noticed it being slightly imprecise compared to other Bomberman's.

60
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:38,675
Speaker 1: so I'm.

61
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:39,518
Speaker 1: I've heard the 60 FPS.

62
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,874
Speaker 1: This you know cleans it up, but to do that they cut the resolution cuz.

63
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:45,380
Speaker 1: hey look the switch ain't that powerful.

64
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:46,945
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then again.

65
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:47,748
Speaker 1: It's like wait a minute.

66
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,533
Speaker 1: This is just fucking Bomberman.

67
00:03:49,674 --> 00:03:51,500
Speaker 1: You can play fucking Zelda on this thing.

68
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,248
Speaker 1: Why is no Bomberman a problem?

69
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:53,690
Speaker 1: I don't know.

70
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:02,728
Speaker 0: I mean I get a frame stutter occasionally in Zelda But it's usually in like really grassy areas with a bunch of little guys Mm-hmm, but I get them pretty reliably.

71
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:07,853
Speaker 0: There's a few places the map or a beetle pretty much Always stutter if I look around at all.

72
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:10,920
Speaker 1: I think if they work harder on the code They could probably optimize it more.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,600
Speaker 0: But I feel like it doesn't matter that much though because how much resolution needed for Bomberman?

74
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,503
Speaker 1: Can you see the bombs?

75
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:21,786
Speaker 0: good you only need high-res for Bomberman if you're gonna have giant map options Which this game clearly does not know.

76
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:23,050
Speaker 1: it's not Bomberman high-ten.

77
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:26,140
Speaker 1: Nah, which is the first HD video game as far as I'm aware.

78
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:42,519
Speaker 0: So uh yeah, I'm actually really excited about this Mario Kart because I'm pretty sure my favorite Bomberman That's modern because I know you're what you're about to say is the one on the 3ds, but Mario Kart 8 Like the one that we used to play.

79
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:49,839
Speaker 1: Oh the GameCube one N64 was an N64 or a GameCube one that we liked a lot.

80
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,353
Speaker 0: I don't think we like the N64 one that much.

81
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,235
Speaker 1: I think it was a GameCube one that had a crappy single-player as most Bomberman's do.

82
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,480
Speaker 1: yeah Bomberman's yeah.

83
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,991
Speaker 0: No, I'm talking about Mario Kart Mario Kart.

84
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:01,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, the best Mario Kart is a GBA one.

85
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, and I was trying to have it off because that's not modern.

86
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:05,720
Speaker 0: the most the modern one.

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,606
Speaker 1: It's not modern about it.

88
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:08,520
Speaker 1: It was the second Mario Kart game ever.

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,913
Speaker 0: I actually prefer the 3ds one.

90
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,109
Speaker 1: That's kind of crazy to think about right?

91
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,088
Speaker 1: the first Mario Kart game was this oh No is the third Mario Kart game.

92
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,597
Speaker 0: first Mario Kart was on the Super Nintendo.

93
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:20,230
Speaker 1: right then I don't know if Mario Kart 64 came out first or the.

94
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,990
Speaker 1: I think the Mario Kart 64 came out next was the second Mario Kart And that the GBA one was the third one.

95
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,400
Speaker 1: Super Circuit, but Super Circuit is still the best Mario Kart.

96
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:29,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

97
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,700
Speaker 0: I actually really like Mario Kart 8, but I've never owned it.

98
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:56,579
Speaker 0: I've played it at other people's houses because I wasn't dumb enough to buy a Wii U. But now that I can get Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with everything unlocked on the switch I really just feel bad for the people who bought it on the Wii U because you probably still haven't unlocked everything Most every time I've played that game at someone's house

99
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Speaker 1: But I'm the only reason I'm thinking maybe not is that I've had many Mario Karts with unlocking.

100
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,384
Speaker 1: I had the Wii one right for example and that had unlocking and I had the GBA one that Unlocking right.

101
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:10,885
Speaker 1: and every time I had a Mario Kart where things needed to be unlocked I unlocked them all.

102
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:14,938
Speaker 1: so I assume if I had the Wii U one I would be able to unlock them all.

103
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:16,501
Speaker 0: I mean Yeah, but I don't know I mean.

104
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:22,832
Speaker 0: the only Mario Kart I've ever fully unlocked myself was the 3ds one because I would just play it everywhere like all the Time.

105
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,890
Speaker 0: yeah No every single player problem with it was no one ever play with.

106
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,098
Speaker 1: but that's the reason I'm gonna buy this Mario Kart 8 is Because even if people don't come over to my house and play it or anything, right?

107
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:40,451
Speaker 1: Every Mario Kart I've ever owned I have played and beaten all the single-player cups on 5100 150 and I think this one is 200 CC.

108
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

109
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:50,231
Speaker 1: and every single course first place Alright and every single course, so I feel like if I did that in all those Mario Karts I'm gonna do it on this one too.

110
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:55,574
Speaker 0: on the 3ds one I went further and went after the ghosts real hard on the GBA one at.

111
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:59,543
Speaker 1: my ghosts if they're still in there are Perhaps unbeatable.

112
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:03,840
Speaker 0: dude in the era of snaking I made some fucking snake ghosts.

113
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,814
Speaker 1: Well, this was in a no snake real skill Mario Kart.

114
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:08,060
Speaker 0: Hey snaking was a skill.

115
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,832
Speaker 0: It was just a very painful and annoying one, but it was a skill.

116
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:14,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't think it's a skill It's race you want to play?

117
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:17,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's play GBA Mario Kart the real Mario Kart and see who wins.

118
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,129
Speaker 0: Let's play let's let's do a tournament of every Mario Kart.

119
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:21,393
Speaker 0: He's the best overall.

120
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:23,339
Speaker 0: That's the entire Mario Kart.

121
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:25,265
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea.

122
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:26,290
Speaker 1: I'm saying it's not shabby.

123
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:27,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty good.

124
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:28,580
Speaker 0: That'd be a good livestream event.

125
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:30,264
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

126
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:33,680
Speaker 0: We just got to get emulators set up for all the odd Mario Kart.

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,130
Speaker 1: I think we could probably manage to get a copy of every kind of Mario.

128
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:40,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't have a working Super Nintendo physically Though we could just emulate that one.

129
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:41,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't have an n64.

130
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:42,136
Speaker 0: emulate that too.

131
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:44,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, those emulators aren't great though.

132
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:48,056
Speaker 1: Also Mario Kart 64 people might hate me on this is the worst one.

133
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:48,819
Speaker 0: I agree.

134
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:56,759
Speaker 1: You might think that the ones with the ones that are broken with snaking are not as broken and stupid as that n64.

135
00:07:57,622 --> 00:07:59,329
Speaker 0: Yep, plus if you didn't snake.

136
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,427
Speaker 0: the ones with snaking were actually super great In a lot of ways.

137
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:12,659
Speaker 0: the Super Nintendo one while it is bad It also gets bonus points for the fact that it was the first one and that it did a lot with the Super Nintendo and the mode 7 graphics.

138
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:17,817
Speaker 0: So in some other news you guys probably are familiar with g2a.

139
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,420
Speaker 0: We've talked about them on the show occasion.

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,640
Speaker 1: If you've never heard of g2a, they're like a sponsor of lots of streamers and that's like how people know about them.

141
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they are bad dudes.

142
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:29,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're.

143
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,876
Speaker 1: you should not patronize g2a.

144
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:35,046
Speaker 1: I Un-endorsed them.

145
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:37,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, do not give them monies or use their website.

Speaker 0: official Anti-endorsement.

147
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:43,013
Speaker 1: Yes official we were not paid to anti-endorse them.

148
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:51,278
Speaker 0: now basically now that there's problems ideology Ideologically with what they do, but there's also problems ideologically with having problems with what if you don't know what g2a is.

149
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:59,980
Speaker 1: It's a website where if you have keys for games and you don't want to you don't want those games you want to sell them You can go there and sell your keys.

150
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:10,267
Speaker 1: You can also if you want to buy a game You can go there and find someone selling a game key and you can probably get the game cheaper than it would be on steam Or anywhere else and you know what in principle.

151
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:12,374
Speaker 1: I think that's totally okay.

152
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:16,056
Speaker 0: Well in principle it is pure market arbitrage.

153
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:18,963
Speaker 0: Just right if I but usually Badges right.

154
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:25,452
Speaker 1: if I buy a humble bundle and there's a game in there that I already have a copy of and none of my friends Want it and I can't give it away to anyone.

155
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,698
Speaker 1: I'll put it on g2a.

156
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,349
Speaker 1: I'll sell it for like a dollar and it's like.

157
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:30,514
Speaker 1: what's wrong with that?

158
00:09:30,594 --> 00:09:30,915
Speaker 1: Nothing.

159
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:32,080
Speaker 1: I think nothing is wrong with that.

160
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,500
Speaker 0: However, nothing's wrong with that except in the general context of the way the world actually works.

161
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:41,560
Speaker 1: Oh, whatever, but that hurts publishers, but it favors gamers, which I think is fine.

162
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:47,720
Speaker 0: Ideally it hurts publishers in the same way that libraries hurt novelists exactly, right?

163
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:59,956
Speaker 1: But you know, they think it hurts them a lot, but g2a does something else which very much does hurt Everybody and that is just allow criminal activity to happen on their service.

164
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:01,400
Speaker 0: So it's a bunch of different levels.

165
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:09,520
Speaker 0: so one of the things that often happens is CD keys will be cheaper in a place where the currency is worth less and they will arbitrage that.

166
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:13,460
Speaker 1: So someone will buy a shit ton of Russian keys and sell them somewhere else.

167
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,767
Speaker 0: yep, they'll also.

168
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:24,662
Speaker 0: there have been a bunch of stories of people just fraudulently hitting API's or otherwise getting keys that the publisher never got money for and just Selling them.

169
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:28,473
Speaker 0: Yep, and like the rabbit hole goes you can read up like is it?

170
00:10:28,513 --> 00:10:30,439
Speaker 1: you can sell any game key on g2a.

171
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,444
Speaker 1: So what if you find a way to get a game key that works but no one ever paid for that game key to the actual Game-maker person?

172
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:43,800
Speaker 0: they also extort as far as I can tell from these articles game publishers in that they will sell your keys.

173
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:51,340
Speaker 0: Anyway, they'll only give you a tiny cut if you sign up into their platform and let them be legit with your game.

174
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:57,830
Speaker 0: But if you say fuck you, you know, we don't want to do business with you They'll keep selling your keys and they won't give you a cut.

175
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,195
Speaker 1: they do all they do.

176
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:02,232
Speaker 1: things like they have fraud protection But you got to pay for it.

177
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:07,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just like wait You're gonna just basically allow illegal activity unless you pay you to stop allowing it.

178
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:09,059
Speaker 1: shouldn't that just be a thing that you do?

179
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,270
Speaker 1: So you can read that Maybe like Gmail like making you pay for the spam filter.

180
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:15,860
Speaker 0: the news isn't that they exist and are shady.

181
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:18,209
Speaker 0: You can type that into Google and you're gonna see that.

182
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:26,644
Speaker 0: the news is that they were at a large game conference recently and they had a panel and the panel looks like you had to keep in mind this panel was coming hot off the Heels of.

183
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:29,416
Speaker 1: I think that they were doing some sort of thing with.

184
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:30,180
Speaker 1: is a gearbox?

185
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,827
Speaker 1: Maybe I think is gearbox.

186
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,852
Speaker 1: and then there was a backlash on gearbox Like what the fuck you do with those g2a guys.

187
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:38,120
Speaker 1: and here I was like, you know what?

188
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,690
Speaker 1: We're not doing nothing with those piece of shit g2a guys.

189
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know we demand g2a.

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,506
Speaker 1: We demand you do all these things.

191
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:45,389
Speaker 1: Otherwise, fuck you.

192
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:48,220
Speaker 1: and g2a was like no, so they're like well fuck you then.

193
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:49,525
Speaker 1: so then they have their man.

194
00:11:49,565 --> 00:12:01,840
Speaker 0: this panel shows up right after that is in the news and they Stupidly Like I feel like at this point people who are at the center of controversy where they are probably at fault.

195
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:11,200
Speaker 0: There's like a playbook of how to not make it worse And I feel like a lot of these people have never read that playbook because they open it up to audience questions.

196
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:15,132
Speaker 1: If you're getting berated why would I mean?

197
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,740
Speaker 1: we don't take audience questions and we're usually getting applauded.

198
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,380
Speaker 1: If I'm getting berated, why would I take questions?

199
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,239
Speaker 0: I mean the president of our country currently doesn't take questions because he knows that would be a shit show.

200
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:31,580
Speaker 0: But one of those only smart things he does they uh, they took questions and you can read what happened.

201
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:46,160
Speaker 0: but basically as far as I can tell the entire audience was nothing but pissed off game developers and game publishers and They surprised the g2a hasn't just like just been law suited out of existence or jailed out of existence.

202
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:54,320
Speaker 0: As soon as you're on the international stage like that like it gets kind of tricky to actually go after companies like this I don't actually know where they're based legally.

203
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:59,156
Speaker 1: I'm surprised that like for example, there are certain things that I'm surprised haven't happened.

204
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:05,856
Speaker 1: For example, why hasn't Amazon slash twitch banned all twitch people who are sponsored by g2a?

205
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:14,820
Speaker 0: well because You can't hurt the ecosystem of how the twitch streamers make money because if the streamers stop working twitch stops working.

206
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:18,860
Speaker 1: I'm just saying like, you know, there are people who aren't sponsored by g2a on twitch, right?

207
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,149
Speaker 1: You could let you know just say hey, no g2a is allowed.

208
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know that does also set up any other sponsor is fine.

209
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:35,820
Speaker 0: There is a big line that can get you into get you into tricky situations If you start having taking editorial control of things that you've previously claimed are open and are automated.

210
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:46,370
Speaker 0: That's the reason why I like a lot of social media platforms Won't just ban Nazis because then they might get sued by other people who say hey if you can ban this kind of content You need to ban this other kind of content.

211
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,220
Speaker 0: That might be illegal in my jurisdiction.

212
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:55,130
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of reasons why people like to just not take a stance Independent of if that's right, that's the reason.

213
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,680
Speaker 0: but anyway, you can read this article.

214
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:03,100
Speaker 0: There's some video there that this panel did not go well for them and it's pretty funny.

215
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:12,755
Speaker 1: So there's that fig thing right which is like the Kickstarter, but you actually are investing in the game somehow Kickstarter for equity the way it were actually, you know, do you know how it works?

216
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:13,720
Speaker 0: I can explain really briefly.

217
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:21,484
Speaker 0: You know, this is the rare time when my knowledge of video games and my knowledge of capital market Is it actually combined?

218
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:26,240
Speaker 1: There's actually some sort of organization that's allowed to invest and they invest and you're buying a piece of it.

219
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,120
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, so it's actually way better.

220
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,030
Speaker 0: So there was a the I think was the JOBS Act under Obama.

221
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:42,090
Speaker 0: a thing that it did is that previously There are certain kinds of things you are not legally allowed to invest in unless you are a so-called Accredited investor.

222
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,980
Speaker 1: that means rich person.

223
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:56,097
Speaker 0: Right accredited investor means that you either meet some other specific requirements or generally you have a net worth Personally of more than 1 million dollars not counting the house you live in so rich person.

224
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:59,024
Speaker 0: Yeah the rationale Rather or not.

225
00:14:59,084 --> 00:14:59,707
Speaker 1: I'm not by.

226
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:01,536
Speaker 1: oh wait, does it count houses?

227
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:02,139
Speaker 1: I don't live in.

228
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,880
Speaker 0: Yes, if you own a bunch of houses that counts.

229
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:10,380
Speaker 1: So if I bought say a beach house and I wasn't renting it It was just my beach house that would count because I'm only living it in like three months a year.

230
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:16,796
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could totally use that as part of your you know Getting up to the million dollars, but the house that I'm actually living in nine months of the air.

231
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:16,996
Speaker 1: No good.

232
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:20,692
Speaker 0: No good Okay, because you can't you just live in an expensive house.

233
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,460
Speaker 0: You can't be like, yeah, I'm a millionaire.

234
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,691
Speaker 0: No, your house is worth a million dollars.

235
00:15:24,732 --> 00:15:25,639
Speaker 0: What if I live in whatever?

236
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,213
Speaker 1: I live in seven houses each of them one day of the week.

237
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:29,199
Speaker 0: I don't know.

238
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,424
Speaker 0: I also take.

239
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:34,560
Speaker 0: I'm not going to express any opinion on whether or not that is a good regulation.

240
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,063
Speaker 0: But that was.

241
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:36,390
Speaker 0: that's the thing it is.

242
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:38,300
Speaker 1: I mean there should be some sir.

243
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,948
Speaker 1: I mean, it's essentially regardless of the details.

244
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:44,920
Speaker 1: There should be some sort of rule saying who's allowed to invest and who's not.

245
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,815
Speaker 1: Otherwise you get scams going around tricking old ladies into investing in things and stealing all their money.

246
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,921
Speaker 0: It's the producers situation Exactly.

247
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:59,925
Speaker 0: They're trying to prevent people who have who stand to lose their entire livelihood from investing in Complicated things.

248
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:02,296
Speaker 0: so you can buy stock without being an accredited investor.

249
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:03,432
Speaker 1: It's not very complicated Yeah.

250
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:26,060
Speaker 0: Because then also because there's a lot of protections around like what stock is and all these sorts of things and but like Putting money into private equity like just buying a chunk of a company That is so much riskier than even people who think they understand it realize that the government basically said no No No You got to already be rich or you cannot play in this field because this field is full of literal minds.

251
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:30,980
Speaker 0: And I can say that because the dictionary says that literal now literally means figuratively, but I digress.

252
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:47,699
Speaker 0: So the JOBS Act a part of it basically allowed for the concept of crowdsourced investing meaning you basically need an Accredited investor to negotiate the terms of the specific investment and I believe themselves invest in it.

253
00:16:48,321 --> 00:17:00,000
Speaker 0: But then legally any number of other people who are not accredited investors are allowed to invest Directly as long as they have the exact same terms as the accredited investor.

254
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:04,993
Speaker 0: So one person who ostensibly knows what they're doing Made an investment.

255
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:05,640
Speaker 1: I have anyway.

256
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:09,310
Speaker 1: So the actual news here is that fig has done a bunch of things using this method.

257
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:16,875
Speaker 1: the current one though is a new Xcom ish game from the person who made original Xcom.

258
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,300
Speaker 0: that's kind of a big deal.

259
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,775
Speaker 1: So the there is a newer Xcom game, right?

260
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:21,480
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

261
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,277
Speaker 0: It's a great game that I don't like but I don't have anything I can really fault with it.

262
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:34,062
Speaker 1: It's a good game But it's you know that those games were not made by the people who made the original Xcom just the same publisher Whatever right?

263
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:53,217
Speaker 1: It's not you know, so now it's like oh here finally after a bunch of Xcom clones and actual games with the Xcom License we have a game not called Xcom But basically is an Xcom game from the Xcom creators themselves the same peoples who made Xcom back in the day.

264
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,520
Speaker 0: now It's interesting because the things that it's kind of like with Team Fortress 2 like before.

265
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:10,200
Speaker 0: The things that made the new Xcom the legit one way better as a game Were the things that made me less interested in it because I kind of enjoyed the weird fiddly bullshit of the old game.

266
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,280
Speaker 0: So when I heard there was new Xcom coming, I kind of wanted the old fiddly bullshit.

267
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:17,770
Speaker 0: I wonder if this game will be the old fiddly bullshit.

268
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:22,445
Speaker 0: And if so, I wonder if anyone would like it except People like me.

269
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:23,729
Speaker 1: screenshots look too good.

270
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,073
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

271
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:26,056
Speaker 0: We'll see how this goes.

272
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:29,832
Speaker 0: I Haven't actually looked into any of the details yet.

273
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:32,360
Speaker 0: So I don't know.

274
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:33,424
Speaker 0: Remember that panel.

275
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:35,892
Speaker 0: we did a PAX way back in like 2009 or 2010 where we were like.

276
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:45,700
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of egregiously obvious things that no one in games has ever done and this was like the third to last slide.

277
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:47,628
Speaker 0: Why doesn't someone remake Xcom?

278
00:18:47,688 --> 00:18:49,154
Speaker 0: and now it's happened twice?

279
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:50,740
Speaker 1: apparently it's happened a lot more than twice.

280
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,030
Speaker 0: Yeah It happened twice for real.

281
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:59,160
Speaker 1: since we did there have been many many resurrections of dead games like Descent has been.

282
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,915
Speaker 1: Specifically there are quite a few Xcoms out there.

283
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:04,880
Speaker 1: You're just not looking at up.

284
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,035
Speaker 0: We also wanted the giant massive Star Wars battle game and they actually made that to like.

285
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:20,106
Speaker 0: so everything we wanted got mostly made but anyway things Of the day.

286
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:21,432
Speaker 0: What do you got?

287
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,900
Speaker 1: So it's just like a one-minute video.

288
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:30,766
Speaker 1: These fine people are in a restaurant of some kind and they get chicken and a burrito Which I could really go for.

289
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:37,114
Speaker 1: I'll take chicken and a burrito right now and they are just so happy That chicken and burrito they cannot contain.

290
00:19:37,154 --> 00:19:41,349
Speaker 1: the dance the dance bus out Maybe and there's some commentary on the dance.

291
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:45,089
Speaker 1: That is quite excellent and it's just one of those videos I just make.

292
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:50,399
Speaker 1: it's only a minute long But there's people in it just being happy and when you watch it you'd be happy too.

293
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:52,808
Speaker 1: Is the best kind of internet video.

294
00:19:52,928 --> 00:20:00,580
Speaker 0: it grows and grows almost like one of those like continuous take music videos We're like, it's zoomed in on the food item and moves up a little bit.

295
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,583
Speaker 0: You see the happy guy.

296
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:03,249
Speaker 0: it's more and more happy.

297
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,777
Speaker 1: and the camera times you spent describing this video.

298
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:06,660
Speaker 1: They could have watched the video.

299
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:07,980
Speaker 1: It's 50 something seconds long.

300
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,632
Speaker 0: But the moment when you see the people way in the back in the kitchen Reacting to this that's the moment wise if you want to feel good.

301
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:22,723
Speaker 0: his 50 something seconds of video 56 seconds of hit the log, baby Gotta be.

302
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:23,967
Speaker 0: yeah, this is good stuff here.

303
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,234
Speaker 0: So, uh, this is the thing.

304
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:34,144
Speaker 0: I've been saving for a while, but There was a game that I played a lot when I when I was in like Middle school

305
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:37,123
Speaker 1: because it was the game that was on the computers in your middle school Yep,

306
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:43,340
Speaker 0: and it was not just my middle school, but also my high school Independently, I found the community for it there.

307
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:50,842
Speaker 0: But you know, this is so long ago that this was a game where I literally didn't really understand the concept of piracy in Middle school.

308
00:20:51,303 --> 00:21:00,111
Speaker 0: so like one day someone just handed me this floppy disk and said here You should check this out and I put it into the computer and there were.

309
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:03,080
Speaker 0: there was stunts 40 racing and la checks.

310
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:13,129
Speaker 1: So this game fit on a one point four four megabyte three and a half inch floppy disk with room to spare To save the custom courses.

311
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:18,027
Speaker 0: this game was so far ahead of its time That it is shocking.

312
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:23,666
Speaker 1: You can't even fit a fucking mp3 on that disc One song.

313
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:30,780
Speaker 1: you ain't even getting one song on there, dude You can barely fit a modern word document on a but you fit this whole goddamn game on there.

314
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,250
Speaker 1: You probably couldn't fit a website on their stunts.

315
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:46,100
Speaker 0: 40. racing was a fully 3d Like legit racing game with giant maps and it had a full map editor That is way more comprehensive than you're imagining.

316
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:58,165
Speaker 0: so this game ended up just getting installed on literally every computer in my middle school and People would pass around floppy disks with their high scores on custom tracks They'd made.

317
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:03,537
Speaker 0: and there was this like weird Trade like there was a currency and some street cred in yo.

318
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,780
Speaker 0: I get a good time on Steve's custom crazy map with the branching paths and we'd like pass it around.

319
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:23,444
Speaker 0: This game was a shockingly big part of my life And my thing of the day is this article that will basically explain to you the history of this game and how that community legit existed all Over America.

320
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:30,388
Speaker 0: in fact all over the world and in fact the community of people who are obsessed with this game Persists to this day.

321
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,914
Speaker 1: There's a lot of games like I mean tech.

322
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,120
Speaker 1: people still play tech mobile same same deal.

323
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:35,904
Speaker 0: So this game.

324
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:36,948
Speaker 1: look at how much?

325
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,494
Speaker 1: how did the hell do they fit all that?

326
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,260
Speaker 1: and one point four four megabytes?

327
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:43,142
Speaker 0: Yeah in what 1990?

328
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:44,582
Speaker 1: Jesus Christ Like.

329
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:46,629
Speaker 0: look like you could just make custom maps now.

330
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,000
Speaker 0: the game even had a bunch of logic to make sure the maps were legit.

331
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:58,479
Speaker 0: Like it wouldn't let you make broken maps, but some people even hacked it and messed with it so you could make broken maps so you could then do some interesting stuff.

332
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:01,206
Speaker 0: and Yeah, you should just read this article.

333
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:02,169
Speaker 0: this is ultra fascinating.

334
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:05,160
Speaker 0: the other interesting thing is I couldn't find a screenshot of this.

335
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,744
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

336
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:07,073
Speaker 0: I wanted some help out there.

337
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:08,040
Speaker 1: It could be a false memory.

338
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:10,066
Speaker 0: No, no, no, this is a legit memory.

339
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:14,600
Speaker 0: the game had copy protection in it like games did in the era.

340
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:22,460
Speaker 0: But basically in southeast, Michigan Every copy of the game that I ever encountered was cracked pre cracked.

341
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,570
Speaker 0: So you did not have to do the copy protection thing.

342
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,413
Speaker 0: the game just worked.

343
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:28,760
Speaker 0: Mmm, and it put up a splash screen.

344
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:33,062
Speaker 1: When you started the game it fit that splash screen in the 1.4.

345
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:41,892
Speaker 0: That said cracked by killa fits because that was the organization or the person I never knew because you know back then there wasn't really an internet.

346
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:43,579
Speaker 1: kill fit them the evil cracker.

347
00:23:43,780 --> 00:24:02,440
Speaker 0: yeah, like this person was a legend in my middle school because they just made the cracked version of the game and it was on the same floppy disk that had LHX and a cracked version of Scorched earth that had the triple tank without having to pay money in the meta moment.

348
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:19,737
Speaker 1: The booklet book is Frank Herbert's dune But don't bother read it yet because we're not gonna read it until we both beat Ganondorf on Twitter today by sheer coincidence I saw a tweet that contained a poster for dune drawn by rio ichi ikigami, oh That was pretty good.

349
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,333
Speaker 1: Crying Fremen, perhaps I I favorited that tweet *laughter*.

350
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:32,180
Speaker 0: This weekend Saturday and Sunday and Friday night, I guess but I won't be doing any panels.

351
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:43,569
Speaker 0: I will be at Zenkai Con doing grinding mechanics and game design for an anime openers a best of edition of that and Flip the table rage quitting in games.

352
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:50,460
Speaker 0: So if you're gonna be if you live anywhere in I don't know West Eastern Pennsylvania, you should go to this con.

353
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:55,520
Speaker 0: I would not fly to go to Zenkai Con But if I lived within driving distance, I would definitely be there.

354
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,379
Speaker 0: It's a pretty legit con and when I'm not doing panels pretty much just gonna be playing tabletop games.

355
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,383
Speaker 1: I'm not going there.

356
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:05,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not.

357
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:05,808
Speaker 1: Nope.

358
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,055
Speaker 0: It might be nice weather this weekend though.

359
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:08,937
Speaker 0: I might have to.

360
00:25:09,178 --> 00:25:09,760
Speaker 1: that's a shame.

361
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:13,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I'm glad I didn't agree to go to Pennsylvania.

362
00:25:13,324 --> 00:25:16,077
Speaker 0: I guess I can go for a long run in Pennsylvania.

363
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:18,985
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with that.

364
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:20,613
Speaker 0: I mean, it's just a forest.

365
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:21,980
Speaker 0: I guess it's not actually in Philly.

366
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:26,280
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, of course Scott, we're gonna show her the Amish people.

367
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:35,532
Speaker 0: we're gonna be going to Pennsylvania later this year because there is in fact a new packs and We're gonna be at it.

368
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:40,697
Speaker 1: You uh, we got to make you know, I mean they put a packs in the worst possible place.

369
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:42,985
Speaker 1: So we Were as possible.

370
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,229
Speaker 1: We have to go and save it.

371
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:47,580
Speaker 1: What is what place on earth is worse than Philadelphia place?

372
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:50,740
Speaker 0: Besides Eritrea North Jersey.

373
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:59,160
Speaker 1: No, I would rather if I were sorry Jersey for all the shittiness actually has quite a bunch of nerds there.

374
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:04,620
Speaker 1: So does Pennsylvania, but I would rather those are Pennsylvania nerds and not Jersey.

375
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:16,240
Speaker 0: If I were forced to live in Philly or in I don't know most of North North Jersey I would actually choose Philly but I would not be a Phillies fan or a Flyers fan.

376
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,044
Speaker 1: Why would you do?

377
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:19,478
Speaker 0: I would basically never follow sports again.

378
00:26:20,322 --> 00:26:27,692
Speaker 0: But the New York is a legit for real packs But it's tabletop only done today.

379
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:34,170
Speaker 0: That's a big deal for us Because 99% of what we do at PAX is tabletop.

380
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,020
Speaker 0: So this is like if you're like us, this is just packs distilled.

381
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:40,045
Speaker 0: It's like a mainline.

382
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:43,896
Speaker 0: It's the heroine of PAX is Other things.

383
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:50,967
Speaker 1: you should check out our channels on YouTube Twitter Facebook Instagram not streaming a lot of stuff.

384
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:56,304
Speaker 1: I'm streaming You know, we got channels and also having trouble finding them.

385
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,870
Speaker 1: It's not hard people.

386
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,523
Speaker 1: We got websites and we you know, you can find it if you want to.

387
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:04,794
Speaker 0: and also we are live streaming Most of the geek nice episodes.

388
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:05,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't watch that though.

389
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,970
Speaker 0: So there are 18 people watching this right now.

390
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:10,896
Speaker 1: Two minutes 18 too many people.

391
00:27:11,036 --> 00:27:15,430
Speaker 0: one of them is watching it while they're pooping which that's a better thing to do.

392
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,840
Speaker 1: There's 17 and a half people.

393
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:22,349
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, we do live stream and the show and other things.

394
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:31,884
Speaker 0: and the only other announcement I have that a lot of you been bugging me about I Still am like I've got the pipeline for new antenna episodes worked out simultaneously.

395
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:41,390
Speaker 0: I've been hit with a ton more Copyright takedown notices and most of them are from the anime companies and they're block notices not just monetization.

396
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:47,080
Speaker 0: so if That keeps being a pain in the ass I am just gonna kill the you tennis show because I'm not gonna deal with that crap.

397
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:52,201
Speaker 0: half of radio free equestria is already taken Down and I've lost the appeals and I'm just giving up on that shit.

398
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:54,630
Speaker 1: So no, you just got to click the final button.

399
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,297
Speaker 1: This is sue me.

400
00:27:55,722 --> 00:27:59,704
Speaker 0: No Unless you and I sign a contract splitting our liability.

401
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:05,081
Speaker 0: No, we'll just Legally only I am liable because it's my youtube channel.

402
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:13,010
Speaker 0: Let's just make an anonymous YouTube channel and Actually anonymous YouTube channels are kind of a pain for a lot of reasons and they'll just get the same DMS.

403
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,264
Speaker 1: They take down notices and then we say yes sue me deal with it.

404
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:16,250
Speaker 0: Ah, you can't do that.

405
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,596
Speaker 0: Let's give legit contact info.

406
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,430
Speaker 1: Why don't we call these companies up and like, you know talk to them?

407
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could try to call King Records is actually one of the most reasonable ones.

408
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,264
Speaker 0: They pretty much are like, oh, yeah Sorry, dude fair use every time.

409
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:36,442
Speaker 1: Why don't we you know, we could settle we don't need to you know, we everyone everyone gets hit by copyright stuff Right, and then they always like the company comes up to them.

410
00:28:36,462 --> 00:28:37,828
Speaker 1: It's like look we're not gonna sue you.

411
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:38,270
Speaker 1: Let's settle.

412
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,409
Speaker 1: Why don't we go to them and say like look we won't drag you into the obvious fair use if you settle with us.

413
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:45,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is because fair use is such a garbage.

414
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:48,823
Speaker 0: Preston It's not actually obvious and it's playing Russian roulette.

415
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:51,596
Speaker 0: if you go into court with that stuff We don't we're not going to court.

416
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:53,946
Speaker 1: We're saying we're just sort of threatening to go to court.

417
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:57,521
Speaker 1: Yeah We're saying, you know, hey settle with us.

418
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,485
Speaker 1: this is fair use.

419
00:28:58,525 --> 00:28:59,770
Speaker 1: Are you sure you want to come after us?

420
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,758
Speaker 1: Look, just let our videos be where it's not like.

421
00:29:01,838 --> 00:29:11,753
Speaker 0: I feel like that's only a threat if we also say also We're both super rich and we have a lawyer on retainer and we actually have to have a legit lawyer on retainer Who sends that letter.

422
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:15,885
Speaker 1: couldn't we also just not put clips from actual antenna in the thing?

423
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:19,757
Speaker 0: I feel like that really Minimizes the usefulness of the show.

424
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:21,485
Speaker 1: Did we just distribute it on bit torrent?

425
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:22,430
Speaker 0: That's a pain in the ass.

426
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:23,963
Speaker 0: Don't want to bother I could.

427
00:29:24,024 --> 00:29:24,790
Speaker 1: it's not a pain in the ass.

428
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,192
Speaker 1: I'll do that.

429
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:29,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it all said then we have no idea if anyone even watches it at all.

430
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:30,110
Speaker 1: Who cares?

431
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:31,521
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I don't know.

432
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:35,390
Speaker 0: you can make the show yourself If it's if I'm not putting on my youtube pretty much not bothering.

433
00:29:36,112 --> 00:29:37,427
Speaker 1: See, this is what I'm talking about.

434
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:41,130
Speaker 1: people Right rims always telling you to watch because he's only doing this for his ego.

435
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:41,452
Speaker 0: I'm.

436
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:43,630
Speaker 1: I do pretty much everything in my life for my ego.

437
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,774
Speaker 1: I'm just making stuff.

438
00:29:44,794 --> 00:29:51,390
Speaker 1: cuz I like making stuff and I don't care if you watch and because I know the stuff we make sucks I'm telling you not to watch, you know who to trust.

439
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:54,049
Speaker 0: I'm very open in my motivations.

440
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:58,222
Speaker 1: You my rim doesn't actually care if you're happy or entertained or whatever.

441
00:29:58,282 --> 00:30:02,293
Speaker 1: He just wants, you know to Upon him.

442
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,979
Speaker 0: I assume if you're consuming anything.

443
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:06,830
Speaker 1: I actually care about your well-being and that's why I say don't watch.

444
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:15,830
Speaker 0: I pretty much assume Either you are entertained for some reason or you've got an angle and you're about to sue us and you're just gathering information.

445
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:17,888
Speaker 0: It's one of those two things anyway.

446
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:34,863
Speaker 0: Anyway so good friend Matt came over the other day and he introduced us to a game that I had never seen or heard of me either and he described it as it is co-op in the way that Hanabi is as opposed to the bad way.

447
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:39,008
Speaker 0: and It's World War one themed.

448
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:49,796
Speaker 0: yeah, World War one themed and the art is by the Charlie Hebdo guy who was very tragically murdered by terrorists not that long ago and I like that guy's art style.

449
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:51,302
Speaker 0: So everything combined.

450
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:53,349
Speaker 0: This is pretty much a must-play game.

451
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:54,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that's.

452
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:57,066
Speaker 1: so we like you didn't know that person ever did art like when they.

453
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:59,155
Speaker 1: he mentioned that I'm just like what which guy?

454
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:02,890
Speaker 1: and I'm like really that I did art for a board card game.

455
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,037
Speaker 0: You look at the world.

456
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:04,661
Speaker 0: Look at this art.

457
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:08,969
Speaker 0: You're like, oh, yeah, obviously Yeah, and the art is great like this game.

458
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:17,792
Speaker 0: But if if nothing else if we said nothing about the mechanics the theme and style is just perfect Mm-hmm.

459
00:31:18,534 --> 00:31:26,643
Speaker 0: So there aren't that many World War one games that aren't just horrible like war glorification Simulators of very specific battles that old grognards.

460
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:28,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually what I mean, we have one.

461
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:30,178
Speaker 0: We have that one that we've never actually played.

462
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:30,761
Speaker 0: We've read the rules.

463
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:31,865
Speaker 1: that a civil war game.

464
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:32,548
Speaker 0: What?

465
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:36,402
Speaker 0: No That's a. that's literally like the Verdun battle stuff that game.

466
00:31:36,422 --> 00:31:36,803
Speaker 0: We've got.

467
00:31:36,823 --> 00:31:36,883
Speaker 0: Hmm.

468
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:38,790
Speaker 0: We just we've never played it.

469
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,334
Speaker 0: Maybe we should.

470
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:41,370
Speaker 0: we could do a live stream of us playing that grognard game.

471
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:50,218
Speaker 0: Anyway, but the gist of this game is that you are all a bunch of World War one soldiers But the game is not about fighting the war.

472
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:53,929
Speaker 0: The game is about not dying until peace breaks out.

473
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:57,990
Speaker 1: Your only goal is a much more accurate World War one simulator.

474
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's a co-op game and it has like pretty good information economy.

475
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:13,022
Speaker 0: But basically challenges come up and you have got to keep making sacrifices until eventually either you die Or peace breaks out.

476
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:13,888
Speaker 0: and that's it.

477
00:32:15,151 --> 00:32:29,341
Speaker 0: It's a really good game and it is one of the rare co-op games that involves process parsing information and intentions from other people Without having any of that fiddly shadows over Camelot.

478
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:33,372
Speaker 0: I am three sure that we can make it through the battle Mm-hmm.

479
00:32:33,753 --> 00:32:43,350
Speaker 0: So the way it works is essentially you'll have you'll each get a character and each character has like a minor power and You have a deck and the deck is two decks.

480
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:51,326
Speaker 0: You have a deck of challenges and if you get to the bottom of that deck There's a peace symbol because if you see the peace symbol you've survived the war.

481
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:52,470
Speaker 0: you get to go home to your families.

482
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:54,929
Speaker 0: There's another deck of bullshit.

483
00:32:55,452 --> 00:32:58,041
Speaker 0: they're the same cards the deck of bad things.

484
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:09,109
Speaker 0: as you fail at tasks or accrue tasks that you didn't deal with you keep drawing from the bad deck and Adding to the deck that's covering up the piece.

485
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:11,739
Speaker 0: So the more you keep failing.

486
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:25,325
Speaker 0: you're trying to run out that piece deck to see peace But as you mess up Cards just keep coming on top of that deck making it harder and harder and harder and if you run out the bad deck It's just a picture of death at the end and you all die and it's game over.

487
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:30,269
Speaker 0: Mmm, so Essentially, you have a hand of cards and you're trying to get rid of cards.

488
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,850
Speaker 1: Yep, you want to you don't like cards in your hand?

489
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:34,729
Speaker 0: Yep, you just want to get them out of your hands.

490
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:38,743
Speaker 0: but every card you play out of your hand goes into a public area.

491
00:33:39,244 --> 00:33:46,490
Speaker 0: and in that public area if Too many of one thing up here and there's a lot of things three strikes are out.

492
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,909
Speaker 1: So it's like if there are three snows.

493
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:52,238
Speaker 1: Right, there's environments and there's obstacles like it.

494
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:58,779
Speaker 1: There's three bullet shells or whatever you lose if there's three whistles Which are raids.

495
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,430
Speaker 0: I guess whistles are raids.

496
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,562
Speaker 0: Shells are like artillery barrages, right?

497
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:05,030
Speaker 0: Yes is obviously gas.

498
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:07,199
Speaker 1: It's like if there's three of anything you lose.

499
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:07,882
Speaker 1: and cards.

500
00:34:08,344 --> 00:34:15,250
Speaker 1: some of the cards only have one thing But most of the cards have at least two and some of them way more than some of the cards are just bad.

501
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:17,902
Speaker 1: There was a card that it all three things on.

502
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:19,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was just the worst.

503
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,164
Speaker 1: There's a card with like two weathers and a thing on.

504
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:22,090
Speaker 1: it's like he's right.

505
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:34,357
Speaker 1: So it's like on your turn you play a card and you add it to the tableau and now it's like, okay Well now there are two cards out there with snow and two cards out there with bullets and the next guy look at his Hand and every single card has snow in it.

506
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:35,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

507
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:45,630
Speaker 0: well, I have to play a card on my turn or Now you can talk and coordinate but the very specific rules are you cannot talk about anything in your hand.

508
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:49,043
Speaker 0: You cannot share what you've got in your hand at all.

509
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:49,565
Speaker 1: Yep.

510
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:54,129
Speaker 0: It's pretty clear Yep, and there's another action of like doing the support thing.

511
00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:58,550
Speaker 0: When you play the support thing, you cannot say what you played.

512
00:34:59,352 --> 00:35:01,640
Speaker 0: Other people might be able to infer it from other actions you've taken.

513
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:05,260
Speaker 0: but you cannot actually say I'm pointing it left or I'm pointing It right.

514
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:13,933
Speaker 0: Yep So on your turn you'll either play a card from your hand and as long as you don't hit three of one of the bad things Then it's good.

515
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:15,638
Speaker 0: just continues and you're trying to get rid of.

516
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:19,150
Speaker 1: more people can play more cards now or you can withdraw.

517
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,210
Speaker 0: Mmm.

518
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,720
Speaker 0: withdrawing means you don't play any more cards.

519
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:26,435
Speaker 0: Everyone else keeps going around, but you're safe You don't have to do anything else.

520
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:28,504
Speaker 1: You're you're gonna still have cards in your hand.

521
00:35:28,785 --> 00:35:29,870
Speaker 1: It's less than perfect, right?

522
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,040
Speaker 1: Ideally you would withdraw after playing your entire hand of cards.

523
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:34,064
Speaker 1: We were never able to do that.

524
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:35,450
Speaker 1: Yep, except maybe round one.

525
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:44,704
Speaker 0: So the way they turn the way the game actually is structured is there'll be a team leader and the team leader Essentially makes a bid like how big a task are we gonna go after?

526
00:35:44,745 --> 00:35:46,290
Speaker 1: how many cards are we gonna start with in our?

527
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:52,310
Speaker 1: Yep, and then you're gonna draw to make a higher number because if you go through more rounds the game is much harder.

528
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,609
Speaker 1: You want to beat the game in less?

529
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,188
Speaker 1: rounds gonna play more cards and fewer rounds in order to be able to win if you do it like to.

530
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:02,668
Speaker 1: if you do a Little little rounds with just a few cards each each around will be easier to deal with.

531
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:07,150
Speaker 1: sure but every round you're getting more cards in the evil deck and it's just like

532
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:08,732
Speaker 0: Yep,

533
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:12,305
Speaker 1: you have to pull off like a round of you know, five six cards something like

534
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:15,169
Speaker 0: you gotta be very tactile about it Like if you had a few bad rounds in a row.

535
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:31,790
Speaker 0: you got to take on a really easy challenge to try to clear the decks because the more cards you have in your hand when You all finally withdraw because you keep going till everyone's out of cards or everyone withdraws All the cards you've got in your hands contribute to how many more bad things you put on top of that piece.

536
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:34,310
Speaker 0: Just pushing piece further and further away.

537
00:36:34,812 --> 00:36:38,929
Speaker 0: It is very difficult to express until you actually play the game because the mechanics are so novel.

538
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:42,990
Speaker 0: How well it simulates the feeling of sinking into mud.

539
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:48,210
Speaker 0: It sucks you are trying to crawl out of this pit and mud just keeps sliding in.

540
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:49,377
Speaker 0: Everything you do.

541
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:54,126
Speaker 1: worse is when it's your turn and like you're so smart You're like how we're gonna survive everything cuz we're so smart.

542
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:54,750
Speaker 1: It gets your turn.

543
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,286
Speaker 1: It's like well, I have to just kill us.

544
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:56,831
Speaker 1: this round There's.

545
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:57,114
Speaker 1: no I have.

546
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,607
Speaker 1: no I have to play a card and they all kill us.

547
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:03,886
Speaker 0: Yep Especially when so even worse some of the cards you play they don't add anything to the center.

548
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:04,910
Speaker 1: They just change the rules.

549
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:12,884
Speaker 1: Yeah by restricting you even further like oh, yeah, by the way You can't withdraw unless you caught your hand has two or less cards in it.

550
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:19,149
Speaker 1: It's just like yeah Or by the way withdrawn, but I have three cards now I had to play one of them and they all kill us.

551
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,270
Speaker 0: Yep, and or like by the way, you have a phobia against gas now.

552
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,642
Speaker 0: So gas attacks always have a plus one out there forever.

553
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:28,148
Speaker 0: So two more gases and you're done.

554
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:34,228
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like instead of two three strikes you're out for gas is two strikes You're out for gas and the other guys got a handful of gas.

555
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:38,916
Speaker 0: Yep Oh and if you get too many of those phobias You're dead and the game's over and everybody loses.

556
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:43,028
Speaker 0: the whole squad has to survive the war or you immediately lose.

557
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:43,650
Speaker 1: Yeah.

558
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:55,409
Speaker 0: So there's a couple other minor mechanics in that when you withdraw There's these support tokens and they point left or right and you basically secretly decide Who you're going to support on your way out.

559
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:04,070
Speaker 1: So if a majority of these are pointing at the same player that player Can like sort of clean up some of those evil rules that they have on them like their gas phobia or whatever.

560
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:11,090
Speaker 0: Or they can recharge their good-luck charm and then you pass the ones you used to that player to the player you pointed at.

561
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:15,926
Speaker 0: But if there is no player who got them who got the most?

562
00:38:15,946 --> 00:38:17,371
Speaker 0: the plurality of those Right.

563
00:38:17,391 --> 00:38:23,306
Speaker 1: So if each play if you're playing with four people and like one person has two and one person has two No one gets anything.

564
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:27,983
Speaker 1: Yep I'm not allowed to communicate this in advance at all.

565
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:32,977
Speaker 1: So you just sort of have to Majority of people have to support the same person.

566
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:44,735
Speaker 0: Yep, knowingly every character has one sort of cloverleaf like a good-luck Blow it power where you can blow this power once and get out of a tricky situation Like you don't have to play a card.

567
00:38:44,976 --> 00:38:46,865
Speaker 0: You can remove a card from play.

568
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:48,010
Speaker 0: like you can blow it once.

569
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,354
Speaker 0: There's a way to get it back.

570
00:38:49,415 --> 00:38:50,840
Speaker 0: But essentially it's like a one-time.

571
00:38:51,261 --> 00:38:51,723
Speaker 0: Oh crap.

572
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:53,569
Speaker 0: I was lucky that time, but I'm okay for now.

573
00:38:54,692 --> 00:39:12,690
Speaker 0: and there's also a pretty nice mechanic of there's these speeches and Every one of them is like literally a speech bubble from a comic that has the first sentence of the kind of speech that you imagine like a Corporal would give to his troops in World War one when they're trying to hunker down and survive an artillery barrage.

574
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:14,598
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and you got to give the speech.

575
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,309
Speaker 0: you give a short speech and then you can help one of your friends out.

576
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:29,486
Speaker 1: But at the same time we played we wanted to use these and we kept getting some sort of restriction like sorry Can't use those up and it's just like we used them like maybe once and I feel like we could.

577
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:30,733
Speaker 1: we came really close to Winning.

578
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:31,482
Speaker 1: I feel like so close.

579
00:39:32,312 --> 00:39:37,570
Speaker 1: We could have won with just a few more of those But we were restricted and weren't allowed to use them by some other cards.

580
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:45,347
Speaker 0: Well, like one of the phobias is you become mute Which is pretty great because the rule that was definitely one of the most fun things.

581
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:52,042
Speaker 1: and it you think And I first saw that I thought it was gonna be stupid Like we didn't play test this at all, but actually it was fun.

582
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:52,524
Speaker 1: It worked out.

583
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:56,637
Speaker 0: Well, it was fun and it was also Crippling to our ability to coordinate.

584
00:39:56,757 --> 00:40:00,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like yeah, you can't tell anyone within your hand, but you're still communicating a whole bunch.

585
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:06,668
Speaker 1: Yep, right, but it's like yeah, not only can you not give speeches cuz you're mute and you can't talk But you're mute and you can't talk.

586
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:12,414
Speaker 0: so the actual experience of the game like in terms of how it actually breaks down because you can be like you can find the Rules and read it.

587
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:20,950
Speaker 0: I highly recommend you just get it and play it because it's good But what you're basically gonna find is that the game is this very delicate balance of trying to figure out.

588
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:38,370
Speaker 0: Each of you has some information But no one has the full picture and you argue with each other to decide how much of a challenge to take Knowing that you need to take more challenges in order to survive But at the same time taking a challenge bigger than you could actually deal with could be disastrous.

589
00:40:38,832 --> 00:40:42,104
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and it really just has I wonder she.

590
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:43,610
Speaker 1: I guess that obviously wouldn't work.

591
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:45,621
Speaker 1: We just picked like some enormous number like 10.

592
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:53,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, just do the whole deck Alright, so unless we clear it the whole deck in that one go which mathematically is impossible.

593
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:54,629
Speaker 0: I believe I believe it is.

594
00:40:55,391 --> 00:41:02,010
Speaker 0: Then great we withdraw and then we get Joe we draw the entire rest of the bad deck and death breaks out instead of peace.

595
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:14,550
Speaker 0: Right, but I just really appreciate this is such a good example of a game that Perfectly melds the theme of the game and the mechanics of the game.

596
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:18,290
Speaker 1: You could I mean this game is so like doesn't have a lot of components.

597
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,220
Speaker 1: You could have easily put some any theme it on this right?

598
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:29,849
Speaker 1: It could have been like, you know, oh You know surviving pretty much anywhere or anything where there's some sort of pressure and you need to sort of.

599
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:39,810
Speaker 1: you know Get through right like y'all, you know, it could have been some sort of trek like get across the jungle Game about a data center and each of you is in charge of a server, right?

600
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,997
Speaker 1: You can't have three heats.

601
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,330
Speaker 1: You can't have three losses of power.

602
00:41:43,912 --> 00:41:46,620
Speaker 1: Three our hard drive crash hacker, right?

603
00:41:47,142 --> 00:41:48,767
Speaker 1: It's like pretty much any situation.

604
00:41:48,787 --> 00:41:52,780
Speaker 1: you could apply this to anything But the World War one works really well.

605
00:41:53,391 --> 00:42:06,710
Speaker 0: But yeah, but but and just so perfectly mechanically but - it is very interesting to me to see a game That is about war that is not about fighting the war and not about winning the war.

606
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:10,670
Speaker 0: You literally do not like you do not give a shit how the war is going.

607
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,104
Speaker 1: It's also very rare to see a game with a war theme that is co-op.

608
00:42:15,144 --> 00:42:16,549
Speaker 1: That's not just team versus co-op.

609
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,881
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually a hundred percent co-op war.

610
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:22,570
Speaker 0: and where the theme is just we're in this together.

611
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:34,350
Speaker 1: War is hell right because like most of the war books and war movies that I experience in my life are You know that like, you know just shows the suffering of war, right?

612
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,470
Speaker 1: You know just one side and how shitty war is and war is the worst, right?

613
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,010
Speaker 1: And it's not about fighting necessarily all the time, right?

614
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:52,541
Speaker 1: But when you look at games the games of war are always, you know much more in line of you know glorifying Combat and such.

615
00:42:52,642 --> 00:42:55,717
Speaker 1: Yep, right And about winning and losing.

616
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:57,804
Speaker 1: I mean the reality of war.

617
00:42:57,904 --> 00:43:02,784
Speaker 0: it literally doesn't even matter What side of the war these soldiers are on right?

618
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:13,058
Speaker 1: I'd like to see More games both video and tabletop, you know that are about war is bad The same way that movies and books are about war is bad.

619
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,267
Speaker 1: Like, you know, Johnny got your gun or whatever, right?

620
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:23,549
Speaker 1: Yep as a Unless games that are about war let's win and kill everybody.

621
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:27,225
Speaker 0: I mean, this is basically all quiet on the Western Front the game.

622
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:34,390
Speaker 0: Yep, just And it feel you know, it feels very like you throw down a gas card and it's like ah gas attack.

623
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:35,537
Speaker 0: We just got to make it through.

624
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,705
Speaker 0: Oh my god guys.

625
00:43:36,725 --> 00:43:40,521
Speaker 0: We just got to make it Come on, just over that next hill and then we're all dead and it's over.

626
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:42,929
Speaker 0: We uh, we never survived the war.

627
00:43:43,672 --> 00:43:43,893
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

628
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:46,406
Speaker 0: Also a very perfect thematic bonus.

629
00:43:46,747 --> 00:43:51,484
Speaker 0: There is Literally one card in the entire deck.

630
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:53,250
Speaker 0: That is not a bad thing.

631
00:43:54,093 --> 00:44:00,336
Speaker 0: There's the Christmas card, all right if the Christmas card comes up It's free parking.

632
00:44:00,356 --> 00:44:02,790
Speaker 0: just nothing happens and the next player takes their turn.

633
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:11,496
Speaker 0: That is the best possible thing you can do is have one turn where one player does not make things worse Mm-hmm.

634
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,350
Speaker 0: Oh, there's also that trap mechanic.

635
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:13,972
Speaker 0: We did so.

636
00:44:14,514 --> 00:44:17,164
Speaker 0: the game also has some push your luck aspects and some of the cards.

637
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:26,390
Speaker 0: not only do they have a bunch of But they got this trap symbol meaning you then flip over another card from the face down deck.

638
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:29,078
Speaker 0: It might just kill you.

639
00:44:29,098 --> 00:44:31,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, push your luck when you're near winning the game.

640
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,117
Speaker 0: That could be disaster.

641
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:34,827
Speaker 1: is a lot of pushing your luck going on.

642
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:41,990
Speaker 0: Yep So, I mean, I don't know what else we could really say except that this game is pretty unique.

643
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:49,555
Speaker 0: I have not seen other games that are quite like this now and that is the primary reason why I think I want to recommend It to you and independently.

644
00:44:49,575 --> 00:44:52,549
Speaker 0: I actually had a lot more fun with it than I expected to.

645
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:59,170
Speaker 1: We played it a second time Because the first time was so good and we didn't win and we're like we'll try again and we still didn't win.

646
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,638
Speaker 0: But it was better and I actually do.

647
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:02,850
Speaker 0: I'm probably just gonna buy it because I want to play this.

648
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Speaker 0: This would be a good game to play after quartermaster general because quartermaster general.

649
00:45:07,064 --> 00:45:08,910
Speaker 0: I wish I also love is also war.

650
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:10,945
Speaker 0: It is war but yeah, we're fighting the war.

651
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:19,475
Speaker 0: Of course It's actually an interesting take too because it's just the logistical and strategic side of the war but not It's a way zoomed out war.

652
00:45:19,495 --> 00:45:23,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's three on three, but it yeah, but it is also still.

653
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:24,671
Speaker 0: we are fighting this war To win it.

654
00:45:25,032 --> 00:45:29,024
Speaker 0: So I think we should play this game afterward to cleanse the palette and remember.

655
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,348
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah war is awful.

656
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:38,810
