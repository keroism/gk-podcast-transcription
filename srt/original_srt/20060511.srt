1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,505
Speaker 0: It's Thursday May 11th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:14,769
Speaker 0: We're gonna finish talking about e3.

3
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:18,047
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:24,604
Speaker 0: So the results are in on whether our podcast should have been three hours or not.

5
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:26,790
Speaker 1: yep, and almost no one voted.

6
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:28,443
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

7
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:29,008
Speaker 0: there were like?

8
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:30,633
Speaker 0: 20 years.

9
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:34,284
Speaker 0: so people in the forum saying yay make it as long as you want.

10
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:36,470
Speaker 0: the only person who said don't make it long.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,808
Speaker 0: With someone who emailed us absolutely every other person who responded of which there were many said make the podcast longer.

12
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:44,028
Speaker 0: longer is better All right.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,915
Speaker 1: Then if we pay for more lips and we can do that we could have done it without more lips And you know it now.

14
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:49,097
Speaker 1: cuz.

15
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:50,627
Speaker 1: then we would have to post a lot more episodes.

16
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:51,090
Speaker 1: on the hosting.

17
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've been fine.

18
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:56,720
Speaker 1: We're on the edge of the hood on the lips and as it is now We're all right.

19
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:58,193
Speaker 0: now We're not anyway.

20
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:05,714
Speaker 0: someone also asked what the longest podcast ever is and I'm not quite sure There wasn't something.

21
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:08,825
Speaker 0: I tried like for 15 minutes to google it and I couldn't find it.

22
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:19,350
Speaker 0: however someone in our forums Linked to a couple podcasts that are on average pretty long and the longest one I saw was the bib and yaz podcast.

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:26,648
Speaker 0: I have no idea what this podcast is about but it I think I saw an episode that was like two hours and change or almost three hours.

24
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:34,283
Speaker 0: Yeah maybe we can find out what the longest podcast ever was or is and Beat it just once.

25
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:35,170
Speaker 1: that's real easy.

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,192
Speaker 1: All I have to do is use my little random tone generator and generate random tones that are one second longer than whatever that is And put it up.

27
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:46,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is you know that counts in a semantic argument.

28
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,753
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's also real compressible Mp3 wise.

29
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:56,249
Speaker 0: yeah, however if you the Guinness Book of World Records doesn't let you get away with stuff like the Guinness Book of World Records Is barely researched bullshit?

30
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,716
Speaker 0: Well, it's not about research.

31
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:00,162
Speaker 0: It's about you know.

32
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:01,287
Speaker 1: It's about worlds.

33
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:02,110
Speaker 1: blankie is blank.

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,855
Speaker 1: It's not anything that it is.

35
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:04,376
Speaker 0: they put in.

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:15,490
Speaker 0: the world's blankie is blank and then if you think you got more blankiness then You go, and you put up a challenge, and they have rules for each blank in his blank, and then you try to beat it.

37
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:16,830
Speaker 0: It's like an ongoing contest.

38
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,292
Speaker 1: I know.

39
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:22,310
Speaker 1: I just remember when I was a kid that the Guinness Book of World Records was really the lowbrow entertainment.

40
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,219
Speaker 0: Oh, it was very lowbrow.

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,450
Speaker 1: I remember when they banned white lowbrow.

42
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:35,965
Speaker 1: They banned a long time ago all of the body Related ones because people were hurting themselves trying to set records like ate the most broken glass.

43
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,710
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, our fattest.

44
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:42,549
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I think early Bay currently has the fattest title.

45
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:48,436
Speaker 0: Okay So maybe one day.

46
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:49,419
Speaker 0: We'll make a long one.

47
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,890
Speaker 0: I don't care, but rim seems to be anti long podcast.

48
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just generally don't think it's a good idea.

49
00:02:55,571 --> 00:03:01,330
Speaker 1: I mean I know if I were listening I'd probably just stop listening after an hour or so, but I don't have time to listen to podcasts anyway.

50
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:09,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I think the idea is that since it's a podcast not a radio show that people will pause it on their iPod and then Continue later,

51
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:15,499
Speaker 1: but by the same token by spreading it out into two hour and a half podcasts It saves us some effort down the road.

52
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,450
Speaker 0: I guess theoretically.

53
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,150
Speaker 1: But for all they know we did record the whole thing that night, and we just split it up.

54
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:26,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, no he didn't know we did, but I just want to say that you know.

55
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:36,665
Speaker 0: uh While I don't care if we actually do long podcasts or not If you really wanted long podcasts, and you're not getting them direct all your blame to rim.

56
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:39,252
Speaker 0: yep yell at me yellow rim Scott That's me.

57
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:41,398
Speaker 0: Oh no problem with the long podcast.

58
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:41,779
Speaker 0: I'm with you.

59
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:44,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if there's any problems yell at rim.

60
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:53,106
Speaker 0: Yeah People know which one of us is which right because other podcasts introduce themselves and everyone seems to.

61
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,730
Speaker 1: anytime there's been an argument.

62
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:59,810
Speaker 1: It's like they can equate the way we speak and the things we say on the show with the things we say in the forum.

63
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:02,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems like they can do that.

64
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,070
Speaker 1: But of course the guy who was trying to guess what we look like based on our voices thought I was Hispanic.

65
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:08,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know why I thought that.

66
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:16,500
Speaker 0: yeah, we are clearly not Hispanic Very very not Hispanic although we like Hispanics.

67
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,183
Speaker 0: Hispanics are cool.

68
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we are not them.

69
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:24,349
Speaker 1: So news time yeah in the news now, I got some non e3 news.

70
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:33,870
Speaker 0: here I also have non e3 news because well there wasn't so much because like we're gonna cover all This stuff that was e3 news is part of the main bit.

71
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:39,506
Speaker 0: So the only real e3 news we can cover is like the side news, and there wasn't so much of it.

72
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:44,509
Speaker 0: at least it wasn't Prominent enough at this time for us to find it.

73
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:56,828
Speaker 0: See that like yeah next week all the news from all the tiny booths around e3 from the independent game developers is Gonna start crawling up as the Sony Nintendo Microsoft news is complete.

74
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:57,852
Speaker 1: of course It was also.

75
00:04:57,892 --> 00:05:03,190
Speaker 1: there's a lot of news that is interesting, but really isn't worth getting a billing as a news bit.

76
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:05,300
Speaker 0: Oh clearly, that's like every day.

77
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,510
Speaker 1: Paris Hilton was there with her stupid game.

78
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:10,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, Adam West was giving signatures.

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,324
Speaker 1: Adam West is awesome.

80
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:12,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not a news bit.

81
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,337
Speaker 1: We could do a whole show on Adam West.

82
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:14,919
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

83
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:15,682
Speaker 0: That'd be scary.

84
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:18,293
Speaker 0: I Have to show you that.

85
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:22,189
Speaker 0: remind me to show you an animated gif from old Batman after the show, okay?

86
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:29,147
Speaker 1: But anyway, my news is something that happened and started a long time ago, but it finally ended.

87
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,070
Speaker 1: so that's the news.

88
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:33,141
Speaker 1: There is going to be no dot xxx domain.

89
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:35,629
Speaker 1: I can voted it down completely.

90
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:38,697
Speaker 1: I say it's great news.

91
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:43,279
Speaker 0: Well, see I didn't really care about you know, the Existence of the domain itself.

92
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,357
Speaker 1: I mean it's our hair from a technical standpoint Not even from a porn standpoint.

93
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,450
Speaker 0: as far as I'm concerned at the more top-level domains the better.

94
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:55,428
Speaker 1: No, the more top-level domains the more convoluted broken and stupid DNS becomes.

95
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,730
Speaker 0: Yeah Well that makes it more and more likely we should get some IPv6 in the house.

96
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,857
Speaker 1: That doesn't have anything to do with DNS.

97
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:04,485
Speaker 0: I thought that IPv6 had a newer better DNS to hide it.

98
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:04,906
Speaker 0: What?

99
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:08,407
Speaker 1: no no DNS is completely independent of IPv6.

100
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:11,542
Speaker 1: There are different layers and everything have nothing to do with.

101
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:17,690
Speaker 0: I know they don't have anything to do with each other But I figured that when they switch to IPv6, oh switch DNS to something newer better.

102
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:24,390
Speaker 1: No, because even if they quote-unquote switch to IPv6, that's not something that would happen immediately.

103
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,615
Speaker 1: It would be a long slow.

104
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,198
Speaker 0: I know that.

105
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:28,930
Speaker 1: I know that you can't just have a long slow change of something.

106
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,874
Speaker 0: Well, you know we need to do.

107
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:33,789
Speaker 0: we need to go check for RFCs for stuff like DNS 2.0.

108
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:34,170
Speaker 1: You know what?

109
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,934
Speaker 1: There's really nothing.

110
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,481
Speaker 1: DNS is fine.

111
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,168
Speaker 0: There's no way to make that better.

112
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:44,790
Speaker 1: There are ways to make it better But the ways to make it better in would have other negative side effects.

113
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,646
Speaker 1: They suck or would be difficult to implement or a lot of people will just say fuck you.

114
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,269
Speaker 1: We're not changing.

115
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,599
Speaker 1: DNS isn't really broken or anything.

116
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,442
Speaker 1: It works fine.

117
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:55,210
Speaker 1: The only people who complain about it now.

118
00:06:55,692 --> 00:07:03,709
Speaker 1: This is gonna be interesting because I've noticed something about people who are first or second year IT students Because they post a lot on slash out about this.

119
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,596
Speaker 1: They always whenever DNS comes up.

120
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:10,970
Speaker 1: They always say DNS is horrible and stupid and broken and it's gonna die.

121
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,317
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's honest last legs.

122
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:13,080
Speaker 1: We need to get rid of it.

123
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,790
Speaker 1: We need something better and I've noticed that most of the reasons they give for it being broken are really just them not understanding how DNS works.

124
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:23,410
Speaker 0: That happens with anything.

125
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:35,030
Speaker 1: Well, it seems that because DNS if you don't know how to come out of set it up and you're a you know Freshman in IT and you're building a DNS server It's kind of painful because you don't know the syntax of the text file you have to write.

126
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:41,135
Speaker 1: But once you learn the syntax of the text file and then you know why it's that way and why everything is the way it Is you go?

127
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:42,321
Speaker 1: Oh, all right.

128
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,769
Speaker 1: This is actually pretty good.

129
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:45,755
Speaker 1: It works fairly well.

130
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:47,482
Speaker 0: Yeah, DNS works.

131
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:55,850
Speaker 0: Okay, but you know as As with any computer geek, even if you have something that works just fine You're always looking for something that works better and awesomer.

132
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:59,803
Speaker 1: That's very much the difference between IT and CS on a very high level.

133
00:07:59,843 --> 00:08:02,050
Speaker 1: broad fundamental planning perspective.

134
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:07,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, this Linux kernel is okay, but I need something else.

135
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:14,965
Speaker 1: pirate kernel universe Yeah, but like I I do IT for a living.

136
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,633
Speaker 1: like Scott is CS I am IT.

137
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:19,590
Speaker 1: We're both computer guys, but don't think that we do the same thing.

138
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:21,966
Speaker 1: We really can't do what either of us does.

139
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:25,678
Speaker 0: very well Like I know more about his stuff than he knows about my.

140
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:28,327
Speaker 1: yeah, you have proven that wrong a couple times.

141
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,373
Speaker 0: I know plenty about IT stuff.

142
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:33,542
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not like the master.

143
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,510
Speaker 1: you couldn't even get an NTP server working.

144
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:36,272
Speaker 0: I could.

145
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:37,998
Speaker 0: I got it working just fine.

146
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:39,985
Speaker 1: It didn't work and you complained about it.

147
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:41,429
Speaker 0: I knew how to do NTP.

148
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,160
Speaker 0: I just didn't know how to do super NTP.

149
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,167
Speaker 1: You didn't know how to do NTP.

150
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:44,630
Speaker 1: that works.

151
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,730
Speaker 0: You know, that's the thing is that I know how to do the basic normal level of everything.

152
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,358
Speaker 0: You know how to do but just not the really good level of you know Super you don't know how to do anything that I.

153
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,242
Speaker 1: what do you mean super?

154
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:56,990
Speaker 1: you couldn't make an NTP server go.

155
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,557
Speaker 0: I can make an NTP server go.

156
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:00,305
Speaker 0: I just can't make it go the way I want.

157
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:01,329
Speaker 1: How did you want it to go?

158
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,662
Speaker 0: I wanted it to Serve the time.

159
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:12,010
Speaker 0: I Wanted it to serve the time to other computers and also get the time from a different computer.

160
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,517
Speaker 1: That's like the simplest.

161
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:15,044
Speaker 1: that's all NTP does.

162
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:16,190
Speaker 1: that's the most basic.

163
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,561
Speaker 1: That is a three line configuration file.

164
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,450
Speaker 1: four lines if you want to be fancy.

165
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,839
Speaker 0: But I also wanted to have.

166
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:26,683
Speaker 0: I wanted to have like security things So other people couldn't get the time and no one could change the time.

167
00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:27,125
Speaker 1: You know what?

168
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,269
Speaker 1: five lines.

169
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I put those lines in.

170
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:31,220
Speaker 0: I copied them from the internet.

171
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,910
Speaker 1: It didn't work cuz you probably copied the wrong lines.

172
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:35,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

173
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:37,990
Speaker 0: I can make a computer get the time just fine.

174
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:49,430
Speaker 1: Anyway anyway, I The work I do is generally along the lines of make something that works and maintain it maintain uptime.

175
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,195
Speaker 1: Nothing should ever go down.

176
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:53,400
Speaker 1: don't upgrade something unless you have to.

177
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,827
Speaker 1: the network never ever ever goes down.

178
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:59,758
Speaker 1: if it goes down you Make it come back up immediately and the work.

179
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:01,082
Speaker 0: I do is computers.

180
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:09,364
Speaker 0: Don't already do X. They could do X Technologically speaking, but they don't do X. make them do X. make them do X better.

181
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:10,988
Speaker 0: make them do X even better.

182
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:12,313
Speaker 0: all right now There's a problem.

183
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,538
Speaker 0: They're not doing X perfectly.

184
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:14,803
Speaker 0: make it do it perfectly now.

185
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:15,928
Speaker 0: make it do it better now.

186
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:27,460
Speaker 1: these two Come into conflict in such situations as Rim wants the hosting to be up right now Scott wants to put a new kernel on it The kernel on the hosting.

187
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,450
Speaker 0: I don't go that far, but yeah You know I'll make something and it'll work well.

188
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:36,090
Speaker 0: And then rim will have to be in charge of making sure it continues to work well.

189
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:39,404
Speaker 0: And then I'll say all right I made a thing to make it work faster.

190
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:42,983
Speaker 0: and rim says Does that mean we need to turn it off and then turn it on again?

191
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,490
Speaker 0: and Scott says yes, and I go?

192
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:50,587
Speaker 0: Oh my god, and I say all right when it comes back up.

193
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:51,269
Speaker 0: It will be faster.

194
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,169
Speaker 0: Everyone who's sitting around while it's off can suck my dick.

195
00:10:56,314 --> 00:11:00,061
Speaker 0: Anyway Skip this shit, so we can get to the e3 business.

196
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:00,483
Speaker 0: all right.

197
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,090
Speaker 1: There's gonna be no xxx domain.

198
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:04,890
Speaker 1: I think that's great because it was a stupid idea.

199
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,988
Speaker 0: I think it was a good idea, but that a law to make people use it was a bad idea.

200
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,915
Speaker 1: Mostly well the problem.

201
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:16,814
Speaker 1: It's stupid to have that as a top-level domain because now you're making a domain That's based on the content.

202
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:24,218
Speaker 1: a top-level domain based on the content of the sites as opposed to the Identities of the people who create the sites.

203
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:25,361
Speaker 0: it's all right.

204
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:28,270
Speaker 0: so xxx domain shouldn't be for porn sites.

205
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:31,585
Speaker 0: It should be for people who are pornographers to make sites.

206
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:32,770
Speaker 1: no because that already exists.

207
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,632
Speaker 1: It's calm.

208
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:38,105
Speaker 0: anything commercial was calm, so why don't they have dot xxx?

209
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:38,988
Speaker 1: calm you can do that.

210
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:40,616
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's good Anyone can do that.

211
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:42,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyone could just buy dot xxx.

212
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:46,390
Speaker 0: That's the thing is that you know we need one in between there.

213
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:50,785
Speaker 0: So you could buy Joe dot xxx calm and then rim dot xxx.

214
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,190
Speaker 1: DNS was originally that way.

215
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:53,280
Speaker 0: I know it was.

216
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,370
Speaker 0: it's not that way anymore.

217
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:54,591
Speaker 0: The

218
00:11:54,671 --> 00:12:10,959
Speaker 1: only reason it's not that way is because people got greedy and mostly because idiots who didn't understand DNS were in charge of companies making decisions about it and as a result They said why can't I just name things whatever I want not understanding the technical limitations and the reasons Why things were the way they were?

219
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:12,290
Speaker 1: hmm, but anyway?

220
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:16,450
Speaker 1: There's an unintended consequence of this dot xxx decision.

221
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:30,049
Speaker 1: now for some reason and mostly Fundamentalist Christians and anti-porn crusaders were advocates of this because then they wanted laws that would force quote-unquote Pornography to be under this domain.

222
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:31,655
Speaker 1: That was their goal.

223
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:35,890
Speaker 1: that way they could censor it and they wanted to screw anyone who tried to put porn elsewhere.

224
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:39,929
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna argue about the definition of porn because I think we all agree.

225
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:49,450
Speaker 1: Anyway a lot of other Fundamentalist anti-porn people were against dot xxx because it legitimizes porn.

226
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:55,590
Speaker 1: That group was actually stronger in the US and the main reason that the u.s.

227
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,488
Speaker 1: Was against the dot xxx domain was because of the fundamentalists who were against porn.

228
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:03,475
Speaker 1: ICANN is an international body.

229
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:09,250
Speaker 1: the rest of the world saw ICANN's vetoing xxx as the u.s.

230
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:13,730
Speaker 1: pseudo Christian fundamentalist crazies trying to exert control over the Internet.

231
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:21,570
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of rumbling going on in Europe about this Even though ICANN probably made the decision for reasons that have nothing to do with America.

232
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,670
Speaker 0: Yep People need to know about technology.

233
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:33,639
Speaker 0: There should be some sort of universal law where if you don't know about something you are Thereby prevented from making any decision about it.

234
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:39,330
Speaker 0: if you don't know about fires You cannot be the boss of the firemen.

235
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:41,299
Speaker 0: Yeah That is should be the law.

236
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:47,930
Speaker 0: if you don't know anything about guns You should not be able to do anything that has to do with any gun legislation or anything.

237
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:49,582
Speaker 0: That's the way it should be.

238
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:53,719
Speaker 0: if you don't know about technology You have no say when it comes to a technological matter.

239
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,758
Speaker 0: now you can argue about which matter requires which you know Field of knowledge.

240
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,173
Speaker 0: I don't care about that, but Right.

241
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,250
Speaker 1: I got this great idealistic idea, but I don't care about the details or the actual implementation.

242
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,133
Speaker 0: No, I don't care.

243
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:07,655
Speaker 0: That doesn't matter.

244
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:09,421
Speaker 0: It's just the specific examples.

245
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:09,843
Speaker 0: I don't care.

246
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:10,826
Speaker 1: I shake Rivera.

247
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:16,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever The point is if you don't know about something you shouldn't be able to say anything about it because you don't know nothing about.

248
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,642
Speaker 1: No, you're allowed to say I don't know anything about that.

249
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:19,890
Speaker 0: That's the only thing you're allowed to say.

250
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,688
Speaker 1: Oh, you're also allowed to say will you tell teach me about it?

251
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:24,659
Speaker 0: No, you're not allowed to say that.

252
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:25,324
Speaker 0: why not?

253
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:26,130
Speaker 0: because I won't teach you.

254
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:29,997
Speaker 0: Learn on your own from a book.

255
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:35,130
Speaker 1: Let's get to your news because I'm actually this is something I know a lot about and I'm pissed off about.

256
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:37,602
Speaker 1: Alright, so I believe this is in the news again.

257
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:39,712
Speaker 1: This was killed a long time ago Okay.

258
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:43,350
Speaker 0: So anyway, the cover of Time magazine says something about autism.

259
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:45,596
Speaker 0: So I had seen this.

260
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:49,006
Speaker 0: actually, you know, how often does Scott see the cover of Time magazine?

261
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,410
Speaker 0: who reads no magazines and watches?

262
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,132
Speaker 0: No TV.

263
00:14:51,152 --> 00:14:55,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I happen to see it actually randomly, but I paid it no heed.

264
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:56,187
Speaker 0: I didn't really care.

265
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,950
Speaker 0: Whatever.

266
00:14:58,193 --> 00:15:03,150
Speaker 0: so then I'm listening to the Pendulette podcast today, which is awesome, which is awesome.

267
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:12,587
Speaker 0: It's actually a radio show that's an hour long, but they podcast it which is cool And he gets a Randy on the phone and I'm like, woohoo James Randy's on the phone.

268
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:12,869
Speaker 0: What up?

269
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:19,110
Speaker 0: And they start talking about this autism and I'm like, alright, what are they gonna say about autism?

270
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,430
Speaker 0: It's probably some magic hokey autism treatment, right?

271
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,358
Speaker 0: No, not some magic hokey autism treatment.

272
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:28,830
Speaker 0: all those those do exist and you shouldn't pay them any heed.

273
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:46,903
Speaker 0: Apparently the cover story that is extremely long and prominent in the latest issue of Time magazine is very very supportive of something called Facilitated communication and there is a facilitated communication Institute at Syracuse University.

274
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:54,263
Speaker 0: now, let me tell you what this is Because I see rim like inhaling I'm just.

275
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:57,610
Speaker 1: all I'm gonna say is one word Bullshit, yeah, okay.

276
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:05,997
Speaker 0: So you might know that autism is I guess a disorder that can vary in degree Depending on who you are.

277
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:16,027
Speaker 0: You can be slightly autistic which is called high High functioning high functioning autism, which means you're kind of like a normal person.

278
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,769
Speaker 0: only you're a little weird You know because you're a little bit autistic.

279
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:25,610
Speaker 0: So which means you can live a pretty much normal life, but people who meet you might go Hey, that guy's a little weird because he's a little bit autistic.

280
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:34,374
Speaker 0: Or you can be low functioning autistic, which means you're super autistic and you're basically just.

281
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:41,614
Speaker 0: I Don't want to insult anyone who is low functioning autistic, but you're really just like a gibbering Nothing.

282
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:51,320
Speaker 0: I like, you know, I really I'm not trying to be a fan, you know, usually I'm trying to be offensive I'm really not trying to be offensive, but that's you can't communicate.

283
00:16:51,561 --> 00:17:01,848
Speaker 0: You can't read or write you can't do anything you can make noises and flail around and You just you're really not almost non-sentient.

284
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:08,442
Speaker 1: now There's Asperger's which is similar to autism But it's generally separate and there's still a lot of research going on.

285
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,990
Speaker 1: autism and Asperger's aren't very well understood yet.

286
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,712
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not.

287
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:20,029
Speaker 0: this is something that can be figured out by science and because it hasn't been figured out by science There's a lot of Randy going on now.

288
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:30,837
Speaker 0: the main problem with High functioning autistic kids is that you know, they have trouble in school because they're a little weird and We can do a lot about that.

289
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:32,323
Speaker 0: That doesn't even require science.

290
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:37,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, though kids in mind at this point There's there are a lot of misconceptions about autism out there.

291
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,368
Speaker 1: They're sure mainly coming from the movie Rain Man.

292
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,285
Speaker 1: Yeah Autistic does not mean super genius who just is weird.

293
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,750
Speaker 0: No, it does not there.

294
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,370
Speaker 1: I mean there are a few cases of people who have abilities like that.

295
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:52,785
Speaker 1: They're few and far between and most autistic people are not secret geniuses.

296
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:53,790
Speaker 1: that is correct.

297
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:54,978
Speaker 1: If you think they are you're.

298
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,869
Speaker 1: it's sad, but you're just deluding yourself.

299
00:17:57,613 --> 00:18:06,445
Speaker 1: Kind of like the Shivo situation where oh look, she's following the balloon She's there and then they autopsied and there wasn't even an ocular cortex or a brain or anything.

300
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:06,987
Speaker 0: Yep.

301
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:08,050
Speaker 0: There's just nothing.

302
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,686
Speaker 0: So The problem with low functioning autistic people is that you can't communicate with them whatsoever.

303
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:27,793
Speaker 0: They're just basically Completely void of any human exist like, you know thinking human existence that other people can You know detect.

304
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:29,419
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean there's brain activity.

305
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,664
Speaker 1: They're they're thinking.

306
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:32,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're they exist in their brain.

307
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,478
Speaker 1: We don't know how they exist, but they're there.

308
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:35,200
Speaker 1: It's possible.

309
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:36,626
Speaker 0: They don't know what they're thinking.

310
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:37,710
Speaker 0: We don't know what they're doing.

311
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:42,210
Speaker 0: We don't you know, all we know is they're making a noise They're moving around.

312
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:45,784
Speaker 1: It's you know, yeah, I mean they're people and something's going on.

313
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:48,580
Speaker 0: I can't read they can't write They can't do anything.

314
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,156
Speaker 1: Well, here comes Facilitated communication, right?

315
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:58,335
Speaker 0: So if you're imagine being a parent of a low-functioning autistic child You're pretty much.

316
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:01,910
Speaker 0: your greatest wish in the world is to communicate with this child in any way whatsoever.

317
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,317
Speaker 0: Facilitated communication Institute at Syracuse University.

318
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:07,339
Speaker 0: what they do there is.

319
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:10,887
Speaker 0: Let me let me just write.

320
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:21,983
Speaker 0: Let me read this little paragraph here with Chadwick helping to stabilize her right wrist and her mother watching a girl thought to be Incapable of learning to read or write slowly typed.

321
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:23,430
Speaker 0: I love mom.

322
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:33,390
Speaker 0: With Chadwick helping to stabilize her right wrist I'm doing the exact same thing Penn Jillette did with Chadwick helping to stabilize her right wrist.

323
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:56,177
Speaker 0: People are taking their heavily heavily autistic children to this Institute where other Completely normal people are holding the autistic child by the hand moving their hand around on a keyboard and Basically, it's like if I grabbed rims hand and I took his index finger and I pushed it down on the keyboard and make him Type rim is gay.

324
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,869
Speaker 1: You know what if this were Penn & Teller's bullshit?

325
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:08,826
Speaker 1: right now I can just picture like us doing that sort of bit or them doing that bit where it's spelling out bullshit Yeah, and then the typewriter comes up ding and then he holds it up and then they do their next bit.

326
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,438
Speaker 0: now Here's where it gets worse.

327
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:25,170
Speaker 0: If you think that somehow these facilitators are actually not typing for the children and that The they're just holding the child's hand in place so that the child can you know type as they want.

328
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:27,597
Speaker 0: here is something Randy did.

329
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:38,449
Speaker 0: Randy went and he had the facilitator leave the room and He went to the child and he said, you know, basically Truck truck type truck.

330
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,443
Speaker 0: I don't know if truck is the word but might have been house who knows.

331
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,090
Speaker 0: and he showed a picture of it.

332
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,580
Speaker 0: He's like truck truck truck truck truck truck truck, you know.

333
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,415
Speaker 0: Then he brings the facilitator back in the room.

334
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:50,220
Speaker 0: And what is the kid type?

335
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:53,327
Speaker 0: not truck type something else not truck.

336
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:58,509
Speaker 0: then The kid type something really really quickly.

337
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,973
Speaker 0: That's like this man.

338
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:01,096
Speaker 0: He's making me very angry.

339
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,539
Speaker 0: He needs to leave bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla.

340
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,094
Speaker 0: Huh Right now here's an even worse one.

341
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:06,719
Speaker 0: Are you ready?

342
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,278
Speaker 0: So someone else not Randy did a study.

343
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:18,423
Speaker 0: now There have been 45 studies and all of them has come to the same result and the same result is the facilitators are doing the typing Not the kids.

344
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:20,190
Speaker 0: the kids cannot communicate with anyone.

345
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:26,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's really no question as to whether or not 45 Perfect scientific studies ready for this study.

346
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:29,420
Speaker 0: This is the like the study that is absolutely convincing to everyone.

347
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:36,100
Speaker 0: Someone went in and they would show a picture like a really like a children's picture to the facilitator.

348
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,700
Speaker 0: Then the facilitator believed that you know, the same picture was being shown to the child, but they switched the picture up.

349
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,420
Speaker 0: So they'd show a house to the facilitator and then they show a truck to the kid.

350
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:52,659
Speaker 0: then they would have the facilitator facilitate the kid in typing a hundred percent of the time.

351
00:21:53,321 --> 00:22:01,500
Speaker 0: The kid typed the picture that was shown to the facilitator and never did they type the picture that was shown to the child ever.

352
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:13,905
Speaker 0: ha People are fooling parents of autistic children into believing they are communicating with their autistic children when in fact they are Communicating with some facilitator.

353
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:17,634
Speaker 1: now, there are two possible ways to look at this.

354
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:24,230
Speaker 1: either the people doing the facilitating Genuinely genuinely believe they're doing good like something.

355
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,754
Speaker 0: I think it's the Ouija board effect.

356
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:27,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, the idiomotor effect.

357
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:30,187
Speaker 1: Yep Or perhaps even people.

358
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:33,680
Speaker 1: maybe they're con artists, but they think they're helping, you know, they fake it.

359
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:37,996
Speaker 1: But then the parent feels better and the kid, you know what the parent feels like.

360
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:38,920
Speaker 1: they're bonding with the kid.

361
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:40,307
Speaker 1: I love mom Wow.

362
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:41,975
Speaker 1: Look now the mom feels like there's hope.

363
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,457
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

364
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:46,255
Speaker 0: However Anyone who thinks the second thing is evil?

365
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:49,447
Speaker 0: Yeah, no Hope is better than false.

366
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:52,036
Speaker 0: Hope if you disagree with that come over here.

367
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:59,202
Speaker 0: I'm gonna beat you up Cuz you deserve a beating, okay No, hope is better than false Hope.

368
00:22:59,686 --> 00:23:00,633
Speaker 0: get that through your head.

369
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:04,429
Speaker 0: if anyone disagrees I dare you to challenge us on that.

370
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,415
Speaker 0: challenge anyone on that.

371
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,659
Speaker 0: who is not evil?

372
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:15,260
Speaker 1: It's just really these people regardless of their motivation or taking advantage of parents who really I mean, there's nowhere they can turn.

373
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,889
Speaker 1: There's no treatment for autism.

374
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:18,197
Speaker 1: There's no way to help these kids.

375
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,530
Speaker 0: Nope So the parents are currently with current scientific science.

376
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:24,255
Speaker 0: There is no hope.

377
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,060
Speaker 0: you will never communicate with your child.

378
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:40,340
Speaker 0: it's sad but true and it's much better if you figure that out right away and deal with it as opposed to having this false hope and Many many painful emotional times through the course of your life.

379
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,645
Speaker 1: Yeah It's not to say you don't try.

380
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:47,087
Speaker 1: I mean still you go to the research institutes and let them do their tests and try But don't expect something.

381
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:56,585
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you get your hopes up about something in which there is no Hope you will consistently be let down and that's much much worse Emotionally speaking.

382
00:23:56,625 --> 00:24:07,080
Speaker 0: then knowing there's no hope and thus when it turns out there's still no Hope you just carry on as usual and then if something actually turns up then you get excited now.

383
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:14,079
Speaker 1: We'd be on a much different tack here If the evidence were inconclusive or if the studies have gone both ways or if there were any evidence at all.

384
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:20,587
Speaker 0: 45 scientific studies and the two I just described to you I think are a hundred percent conclusive.

385
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:24,060
Speaker 0: you'd have to be an idiot to not understand what the hell is going on here.

386
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:37,223
Speaker 0: If I if rim is incapable of communication with human beings and I take his hand and move it around on a keyboard And use his index finger to push down keys that say something He's evil.

387
00:24:37,464 --> 00:24:39,756
Speaker 0: I'm the one who's communicating not rim Steve.

388
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:40,520
Speaker 0: Oh Steve.

389
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,855
Speaker 0: Oh There you go.

390
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:52,292
Speaker 1: All right things the day Mine isn't so much.

391
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:52,513
Speaker 1: I don't.

392
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,965
Speaker 1: well, it's a cool thing But I don't have a lot to say about it.

393
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:59,140
Speaker 1: this awesome Mirage appeared in I think Eastern China Shanghai.

394
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:00,448
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm not sure.

395
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:02,078
Speaker 1: basically it was a mirage of a whole city.

396
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:05,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw pictures and I was like, whoa Is that real?

397
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:14,166
Speaker 1: Apparently this area was called the gathering place or the dwelling place of the gods a long time ago because the region the way the Atmosphere is in the water vapor.

398
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:17,760
Speaker 1: It's just very conducive to crazy mirages and illusions.

399
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:19,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like Mirage land.

400
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:20,991
Speaker 0: I think what.

401
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:23,500
Speaker 0: it was just a reflection of the city that was on the other side, right?

402
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

403
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:26,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was cool though.

404
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:26,559
Speaker 1: Check it out.

405
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:30,295
Speaker 0: I saw a picture and I was like, holy crap a freaking mirage of real.

406
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:31,340
Speaker 1: it made it to dig.

407
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,973
Speaker 1: So I'm sure everyone's seen it already, but that's all I got.

408
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:34,837
Speaker 1: I just want to talk about e3.

409
00:25:35,562 --> 00:25:37,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, my thing of the day is actually a video game.

410
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:43,377
Speaker 0: It's called plasma pong and if you go to plasma pong comm you can download it for free.

411
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:45,394
Speaker 0: and what it is It's only for Windows.

412
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:48,169
Speaker 0: sadly It's just pong.

413
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:49,419
Speaker 0: you play it on the PC.

414
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:55,420
Speaker 0: But you have two extra things you can do in addition to moving the paddle up and moving the paddle down.

415
00:25:55,821 --> 00:26:00,840
Speaker 0: You can shoot plasma out of your paddle and you can suck plasma into your paddle.

416
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:02,950
Speaker 1: It's not nearly as dumb as that just sounded.

417
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:09,277
Speaker 0: No, it looks really cool like a wicked awesome screensaver and the gameplay is actually kind of crazy.

418
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:13,774
Speaker 0: because you have to like Said I'm trying not to say like what's with you in the light.

419
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:14,256
Speaker 0: I don't know.

420
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:14,839
Speaker 0: I like like.

421
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:16,251
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're lucky.

422
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,240
Speaker 1: I don't have a big shield.

423
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,413
Speaker 0: That's what I was gonna say is if you had a big shield.

424
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:24,289
Speaker 0: I would eat it like like Yeah So you spray this plasma and a lot.

425
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:28,380
Speaker 0: the higher the level you get to the more the ball is affected by the plasma.

426
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:36,331
Speaker 0: So the ball is just flying around never actually touching anyone's paddle But bouncing back and forth across the screen in the plasma.

427
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:41,594
Speaker 0: and you have to manipulate the plasma in such a way to get it To fly really fast off the other guy's side of the screen.

428
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:42,318
Speaker 0: so we can't stop it.

429
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,191
Speaker 1: Windows only.

430
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,970
Speaker 1: but if I get it to work in wine I'll let everyone know and tell them how to do.

431
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:48,300
Speaker 0: it seems like a pretty simple game.

432
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:50,609
Speaker 0: It should work nicely and it looks really cool.

433
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,370
Speaker 1: You know what the rule of wine is rule number one It will not work.

434
00:26:54,875 --> 00:27:03,389
Speaker 0: rule number two Well, the other final rule of wine is if by some miracle you manage to get it to work It will work better than it works in windows.

435
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the best thing about wine.

436
00:27:05,961 --> 00:27:07,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just things.

437
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,875
Speaker 1: either work or they don't and there's really no middle ground with wine.

438
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:13,025
Speaker 0: No, not so much All right.

439
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:23,159
Speaker 0: last time on our e3 coverage We talked about Sony and we talked about the DS and we pretty much covered everything in those departments and nothing has changed In those departments.

440
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:34,455
Speaker 0: yeah, thankfully because I was kind of worried that we were gonna do this big e3 show and then all this new information would Come out on the show floor and we'd have to go back and add all that stuff in.

441
00:27:34,656 --> 00:27:37,107
Speaker 1: that is true for Nintendo but we didn't talk about Nintendo.

442
00:27:37,128 --> 00:27:37,570
Speaker 0: you intend?

443
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,270
Speaker 0: Oh and Mike the Nintendo Wii and The Microsoft Xbox 360?

444
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,380
Speaker 0: there was some new tidbits on the show floor.

445
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually there was a lot for Nintendo.

446
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:49,037
Speaker 0: Oh a whole lot the more than anyone else at least.

447
00:27:49,258 --> 00:27:49,880
Speaker 1: well in general.

448
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:52,757
Speaker 1: Here's here's the the general vibe of what's going on at e3.

449
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:59,722
Speaker 1: There are crazy crazy lines for everything Nintendo has constantly There is.

450
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:06,140
Speaker 0: you have to wait and in line for I think the guess was six hours to play with a Wii.

451
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,796
Speaker 1: I can play with a Wii right now for free.

452
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:12,900
Speaker 0: I know I don't know why people waiting in six lines six hour lines to do it if you want hell of a Wii.

453
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:20,253
Speaker 0: One guy was at his first e3 and he got in the Wii line and he says I'm not wasting six hours on my first E3 and he just said I just won't use the Wii at e3.

454
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:21,299
Speaker 0: I'll do everything else instead.

455
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:26,660
Speaker 0: But yeah, it really sucks for the journalists who have to use it to you know.

456
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:28,849
Speaker 1: Yeah now compare that.

457
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:43,434
Speaker 0: it will compare and contrast that to Sony and Microsoft where Sony and Microsoft booths the people were estimating you had to wait maybe five minutes to play anything you wanted Anything any game that was playable at Microsoft's or Sony's booth.

458
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:45,280
Speaker 1: five-minute wait other than Tendo.

459
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,919
Speaker 0: Six hour wait to use the Wii other than panels going around.

460
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:55,476
Speaker 1: E3 is basically just a cluster of people fighting to get into Nintendo's area at all times and nothing else.

461
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,462
Speaker 0: and This you know.

462
00:28:58,143 --> 00:29:01,191
Speaker 0: people accuse us of being anti Sony Pro.

463
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:07,296
Speaker 0: whatever we tell it like it is if you're if we were biased or Anything we'd be saying Microsoft sucks even though they're not second.

464
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:08,000
Speaker 0: so much right now.

465
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:17,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I really didn't like the Xbox when it came out But I'm starting to take a shine and the fact that I might buy one is kind of scary to me.

466
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:22,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, when you listen to us talk, you know, we are gonna say some fanboys things like oh my god We really like that.

467
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:23,420
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

468
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,736
Speaker 0: Like you might not like Wario where smooth moves, but that's our favorite thing in the world.

469
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:30,758
Speaker 0: so you can tell okay They really like Wario where and you might not.

470
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:38,369
Speaker 0: But pay attention when we say things like there's a six hour wait for Nintendo And there's a five hour wait for Sony and Microsoft.

471
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:40,215
Speaker 0: That's not fanboyism opinion.

472
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:40,937
Speaker 0: That's a fact.

473
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:44,183
Speaker 1: Well, it's like the At will.

474
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:48,116
Speaker 1: now, I mean we keep talking about the PSP like we never see anyone playing.

475
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:48,638
Speaker 0: is it like?

476
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:51,310
Speaker 1: yeah Well, but I was I used it properly.

477
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:53,220
Speaker 1: I didn't use it as a breakup.

478
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:55,427
Speaker 1: We see things like.

479
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:57,837
Speaker 1: that's a proper grammatical use of the word.

480
00:29:57,877 --> 00:30:03,660
Speaker 1: like that's fine Let's get on with the show so you can go to sleep Alright, I just because there's people arguing about the PSP and I wanted to get this out.

481
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:05,348
Speaker 0: Alright get it out now before we start.

482
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:09,924
Speaker 1: the fact is that at e3 No one has PSP's.

483
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:13,292
Speaker 1: reporters have said this everyone has DS's and they're playing them constantly.

484
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:14,435
Speaker 0: That's a fact.

485
00:30:14,475 --> 00:30:21,075
Speaker 1: That's not you know, I Said, you know, that was great All right, I guess we can't talk about this.

486
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, mr Why interpret that fact as you will?

487
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:26,938
Speaker 0: but there are DS's everywhere and PSP's nowhere to be seen.

488
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:34,900
Speaker 0: at e3 The premier gaming event of the year there are DS's all over the place and no PSP's to be seen except for Sony's booth.

489
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,829
Speaker 1: Alright, so let's start at the beginning with Nintendo.

490
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:41,720
Speaker 1: cuz I I don't want to start with the stuff that was just announced.

491
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:45,176
Speaker 0: Well, I was figured we would do the system and then we do the games for the Wii.

492
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,327
Speaker 0: All right Well, no, let's start out with the GameCube.

493
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:49,678
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a new GameCube game at the end of the year.

494
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:52,652
Speaker 0: Great Super Paper Mario.

495
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,120
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

496
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,591
Speaker 0: Now if you played Paper Mario thousand-year door, you know that well.

497
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:10,820
Speaker 0: or any Paper Mario, you know that Paper Mario is on Mario RPG type game and The interesting thing about it is that Mario and all his friends are made of paper and the world is made of paper.

498
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:24,980
Speaker 0: So they do a lot of interesting tricks like Mario will tear a hole in the background and he'll sneak through a secret or He'll roll himself up like a piece of or fold himself into a paper airplane and fly and such.

499
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:31,980
Speaker 1: The games are also real heavy on the Nintendo style humor slash, you know world which we like a lot.

500
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:33,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, lots of Mario Joe.

501
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:36,110
Speaker 1: Nothing's better than a cute little girl Goomba.

502
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:38,717
Speaker 0: Yeah girl archaeologist Goomba.

503
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:58,558
Speaker 0: Yeah now in Paper Mario thousand-year door, there was a short sequence where Koopa King Koopa did some Mario Super Mario 1 style side scrolling and he got really ate a giant piece of meat and Became the size of the screen and smashed up a whole bunch of stuff.

504
00:31:59,322 --> 00:32:02,696
Speaker 0: But you you know, you controlled that for maybe five minutes of the game and that was it.

505
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:08,406
Speaker 0: Yeah Super Paper Mario is Not going to be an RPG.

506
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:11,360
Speaker 0: It's going to be a Super Mario platform game.

507
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:20,727
Speaker 0: However, everything is made of paper and has the same graphics that thousand-year door has and you can play as Mario the princess and Koopa Who each do their own different things?

508
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:23,920
Speaker 0: It's like a Mario - it's gonna be a really good.

509
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,748
Speaker 0: Well, I think you switch between them at will at least.

510
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:32,947
Speaker 0: I saw a video where Mario flipped over and the princess appeared Like in the middle of a level.

511
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:36,119
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and I think I saw Koopa breathing some fire.

512
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:54,430
Speaker 0: and When the best thing about this game is there is apparently a power-up that not only makes you tremendously huge filling the screen But when you use this power-up, it returns the character to their 8-bit pixelated Sprite as opposed to the new shiny Paper Mario sprite.

513
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:59,846
Speaker 0: So imagine a giant Super Mario Brothers Princess Peach or King Koopa.

514
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:04,580
Speaker 0: that's like the size of the screen smashing everything that's worth it alone for whatever this game cost.

515
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,398
Speaker 0: So that's the GameCube news one new game gonna come out at the end of the year.

516
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:14,660
Speaker 0: Oh Also the Zelda game that everyone knows about will have a GameCube version.

517
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:21,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, Twilight Princess is going to be released at the same time, but separately on both the revolution and the GameCube.

518
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, people thought that there would be one GameCube because they said it's gonna be a GameCube game.

519
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,919
Speaker 0: They said that and they didn't lie.

520
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:40,949
Speaker 0: But people thought that there would be a GameCube version that if you played the GameCube version on the Wii you would get advanced features sort of like Mario, Zelda ages and seasons for the Game Boy Color.

521
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:44,679
Speaker 0: if you played it on a Game Boy Advance a few secret things showed up.

522
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:47,040
Speaker 0: That's not going to be the case.

523
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,333
Speaker 0: The Zelda game is gonna have a Wii version and a GameCube version.

524
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:51,377
Speaker 0: you buy one or the other.

525
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:53,211
Speaker 0: if you buy both You're just kind of dumb.

526
00:33:53,594 --> 00:34:01,555
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so if you have a GameCube and you're not planning on buying a Wii for a long time That's the only way I can recommend buying the Zelda GameCube.

527
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,739
Speaker 1: now I we don't really need to talk about this game.

528
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:07,350
Speaker 1: everyone knows it looks like it's going to be awesome.

529
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:12,539
Speaker 1: several Nintendo people have said things along the lines of We think this is the best Zelda we've ever made.

530
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:21,453
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's what they said and people had mixed reactions to them saying that some people are like, okay This is gonna be the best Zelda ever.

531
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:26,511
Speaker 0: and some people said Okay, they're being real defensive about this Zelda being so great.

532
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:27,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

533
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:29,600
Speaker 1: the game looks really cool.

534
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:32,384
Speaker 0: It looks like Zelda.

535
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:35,759
Speaker 0: it looks like what everyone wanted Wind Waker to be but wasn't.

536
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,699
Speaker 1: yeah It looks like Zelda 64 taken to the technological and plot extreme.

537
00:34:40,803 --> 00:34:43,100
Speaker 0: All I can hope is that it has more dungeons.

538
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,054
Speaker 0: That was my number one complaint with the recent Zelda games is not enough done.

539
00:34:47,094 --> 00:34:47,335
Speaker 0: freaking.

540
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:49,862
Speaker 1: minish cap had three Frickin.

541
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:52,494
Speaker 0: Wind Waker had like four or five.

542
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:53,800
Speaker 0: not you need more dungeons.

543
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:59,520
Speaker 0: I want to seize SNES style Zeldas where there's like four dungeons followed by eight dungeons.

544
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:01,323
Speaker 0: Stuff like that.

545
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:03,590
Speaker 0: That's what we need lots and lots of dungeons.

546
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,700
Speaker 0: That's what make Zelda great a big overworld lots and lots of dungeons.

547
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,951
Speaker 0: Okay, let's talk about the Wii system and what they said about it.

548
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:13,860
Speaker 1: in those preference the conference they had was pretty cool.

549
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:18,844
Speaker 0: They had it in the Kodak theater, which is the place they have the Oscars Now.

550
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:31,251
Speaker 1: it started basically with Miyamoto In a tuxedo with a Wii controller Conducting an orchestra playing the Legend of Zelda but the orchestra wasn't real.

551
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:40,713
Speaker 0: the orchestra was a Part of a video game and as he was actually as he moved the controller differently You could see that he was controlling the temple of the orchestra.

552
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:42,260
Speaker 1: Yeah all the Wii controller.

553
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,620
Speaker 1: I'll say now that all almost everything they showed was not a pre-rendered demo where they faked it.

554
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,860
Speaker 1: It was someone controlling something with the controller.

555
00:35:50,362 --> 00:36:00,131
Speaker 0: People were saying how the Metroid stuff that they showed was a video and not you know Someone actually playing the game at that moment, but it didn't look like a pre-render.

556
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:02,498
Speaker 0: It looked like actual gameplay video footage.

557
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:05,207
Speaker 1: Yeah Now the crowd went wild.

558
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:07,154
Speaker 0: Yeah, the crowd is, you know crazy.

559
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:10,287
Speaker 0: Okay, so The Wii.

560
00:36:10,749 --> 00:36:13,280
Speaker 0: what do we know about the Wii that we didn't know before?

561
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:15,809
Speaker 0: Well, they confirmed a bunch of rumors.

562
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,000
Speaker 0: there is going to be a speaker in the Wii controller.

563
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:20,419
Speaker 0: What does this mean?

564
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:28,980
Speaker 0: It means When you shoot use the Wii controller as a gun and pull the trigger on it the Wii controller itself will make a firing noise.

565
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:32,448
Speaker 0: Now that's kind of cool But what's the use now?

566
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:37,312
Speaker 0: I figured this out when someone you know started talking about it And I think might have been the Engadget podcast.

567
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:40,810
Speaker 0: they were like, okay You have a Wii controller, right?

568
00:36:41,272 --> 00:36:42,859
Speaker 0: Let's say you're shooting a bow and arrow.

569
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:48,200
Speaker 0: Now when you're shooting a real bow and arrow, you have a string, you know, how far back you're pulling it.

570
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,856
Speaker 0: You can hear the string getting tighter and tighter with a Wii controller.

571
00:36:52,916 --> 00:37:01,471
Speaker 0: Just pulling it back You can't really tell how far back you've pulled it and looking at the screen You can't tell because it's a first-person view twang.

572
00:37:02,122 --> 00:37:11,859
Speaker 0: So this speaker in the Wii controller is actually necessary Because it will make a noise as you pull the bow string back to let you know how far back you are.

573
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:20,387
Speaker 1: Also when I finally get my lightsaber game because I have no doubt that there's going to be some sort of lightsaber game LucasArts said we're looking into it.

574
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,813
Speaker 0: That's all the news we've got.

575
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:22,897
Speaker 1: My Wii is gonna be going.

576
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:28,499
Speaker 1: wow And that's just awesome.

577
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't even think no one thought of having that speaker but Nintendo thought of it and now that you know about it It's so essential.

578
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:36,426
Speaker 1: I mean, I just think it's so key.

579
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:44,137
Speaker 1: imagine all the Mario Party WarioWare minigames You can have where one guy's controller makes a noise and everyone reacts.

580
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:44,739
Speaker 1: because of that.

581
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,005
Speaker 1: We got to figure out.

582
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:49,460
Speaker 1: you got to guess whose controller made the noise or do something.

583
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:54,320
Speaker 0: Someone suggested that you would talk into a microphone on the controller then pass the controller.

584
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,619
Speaker 0: Someone would push a button and the controller would play back what you said.

585
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:04,184
Speaker 0: then they'd have to say that into the controller and pass it around like a game of telephone and Silly things can happen.

586
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:05,108
Speaker 1: Nintendo's really.

587
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:11,979
Speaker 1: it's like they put so many things into this so that Developers making games have crazy options to do whatever they want to do.

588
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:21,351
Speaker 0: Yeah The problem is when developers try to use all the options instead of just trying to make a game That really needs the option.

589
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:23,420
Speaker 1: Yep, which luckily seems to have worked out for the DS.

590
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:30,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of early DS people games have made the error of forcing themselves to use every feature.

591
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:34,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, like bomber man God bomber man used the touchscreen and perhaps the stupidest way ever.

592
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:40,155
Speaker 0: But now they're coming back and it seems people realized what's good and what's not.

593
00:38:40,597 --> 00:38:41,680
Speaker 0: so it shouldn't take them.

594
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:45,336
Speaker 0: I don't imagine too many screw-ups on the Wii now that they figured it out in the DS.

595
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:49,719
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay What don't we know about the Wii?

596
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:51,562
Speaker 1: The price.

597
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:56,481
Speaker 0: we don't know the price and we don't know the release date other than it will be in October November December of This year.

598
00:38:56,943 --> 00:39:03,046
Speaker 1: now once again Nintendo is probably gonna stick to their promise that it'll be less than two hundred and fifty dollars or less $300 no matter what.

599
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,639
Speaker 0: I think the only promise was it'll be cheaper than anything else.

600
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:09,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it could be $300, but I really doubt that.

601
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:09,851
Speaker 0: I really doubt it.

602
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:10,252
Speaker 0: Also.

603
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:13,180
Speaker 0: Everyone's the best guess is two hundred two hundred fifty dollars.

604
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone on slash.

605
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:18,759
Speaker 1: I was like if it was a hundred and fifty that would just destroy the industry in my.

606
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:24,940
Speaker 0: I Think they're just waiting to see what the final word is on everything else before they decide how they can set their price.

607
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, I already know the price.

608
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:28,633
Speaker 0: everybody is waiting to reveal it.

609
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:30,220
Speaker 0: That way they can keep the news rolling.

610
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,280
Speaker 1: That's what I was about to say.

611
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:37,660
Speaker 1: They're probably because they've right before e3 they announced that they're calling it the Wii and there was crazy press buzzing.

612
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,166
Speaker 1: Then e3 crazy press buzzing.

613
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:43,435
Speaker 1: then they announced Smash Brothers crazy press buzzing.

614
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:45,721
Speaker 1: then they're gonna announce the date crazy Press.

615
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:53,127
Speaker 1: then they're gonna announce the price and they're always in the news until finally it's release day Plus they also get to announce.

616
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:58,487
Speaker 0: pre-orders are now available, you know, there's a lot of things They just announced to keep the news rolling.

617
00:39:58,768 --> 00:40:02,460
Speaker 1: Yep, as opposed to Sony we're gonna release the ps3 in March.

618
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:05,959
Speaker 1: We're gonna release it in not March.

619
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:17,493
Speaker 0: yeah, I don't know what's better saying a date and then delaying it and then saying another exact date and then eventually sticking to one of Those exact dates or not saying anything and then eventually sticking to a date.

620
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:19,983
Speaker 1: Apple seems to do very well with the hey Guess what?

621
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:25,040
Speaker 0: We just did as opposed to hey It's available on the Apple Store as soon as we stop talking.

622
00:40:25,622 --> 00:40:28,051
Speaker 1: Yeah, like when the Apple Store goes down everyone knows.

623
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:29,817
Speaker 1: Oh something just happened.

624
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:32,839
Speaker 0: Yep What else do we know about the Wii?

625
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:36,068
Speaker 0: There won't be any load times.

626
00:40:36,108 --> 00:40:38,337
Speaker 0: He's promised us no load times.

627
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:39,220
Speaker 1: Now, that's great.

628
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,534
Speaker 1: I mean even the GameCube had a few load times in some games, but those are tiny.

629
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:45,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it was mostly.

630
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:47,264
Speaker 0: No, the load times.

631
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:48,188
Speaker 0: I've noticed in games.

632
00:40:48,268 --> 00:41:00,578
Speaker 1: I have where where there were FMV's and Basically FMV's Yeah, and it seems that third-party port games have load games much more often than first-party games or second-party games.

633
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:07,197
Speaker 0: Yep I think because of the flash memory in the Wii you're not gonna see load times at all unless someone really really sucks.

634
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:12,354
Speaker 0: Yeah There's going to be a Wii classic controller.

635
00:41:12,515 --> 00:41:24,231
Speaker 1: It looks like this white Super NES controller like a cross between an SNES controller and a GameCube controller, but it's all white and we colored and People who have held on to it said that it feels right.

636
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:26,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks like it feels right.

637
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:35,009
Speaker 0: I guess you're gonna use it for your virtual console games, you know, your old-school NES games Yep, which they finally released some pictures and talk about.

638
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:39,684
Speaker 0: the only thing I'm it's weird about this controller Is that it isn't wireless.

639
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:49,809
Speaker 0: you plug it into the bottom of the Wii controller where the nunchuck usually plugs into and I Guess does that mean you're kind of tethered to the Wii.

640
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:52,860
Speaker 0: is there gonna be something that lets you use both at once or switch?

641
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,749
Speaker 0: Between the two or I don't know.

642
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:56,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of tiny details.

643
00:41:57,021 --> 00:41:59,558
Speaker 1: We're really not gonna get until we get closer to the release date.

644
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:03,640
Speaker 0: Someone made a comment that Nintendo always screws up one little thing.

645
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,442
Speaker 0: That doesn't matter.

646
00:42:04,643 --> 00:42:04,863
Speaker 0: like.

647
00:42:04,884 --> 00:42:07,270
Speaker 0: on the NES they screwed up.

648
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,614
Speaker 0: You have to blow into the cartridges.

649
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:11,786
Speaker 0: Yeah on the SNES I don't think anything was screwed up.

650
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:13,616
Speaker 1: No, no, you know what was wrong with the SNES.

651
00:42:13,737 --> 00:42:19,293
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Some button now because I had no problem with that though I know a few people did but you could just yank the game out.

652
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:19,776
Speaker 1: It didn't matter.

653
00:42:19,796 --> 00:42:20,179
Speaker 0: That's true.

654
00:42:20,861 --> 00:42:23,240
Speaker 1: Some not all the SNES is because they fixed it later.

655
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,120
Speaker 1: But a lot of them if you left him in the Sun they turn this horrible yellow.

656
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,446
Speaker 1: That's true because of the plastic.

657
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:30,280
Speaker 0: that's not a big deal now in 64 didn't have enough memory.

658
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,420
Speaker 0: They had to add an expansion thing the GameCube.

659
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:35,632
Speaker 0: What problems with the GameCube?

660
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,761
Speaker 0: I can't think of any Hmm.

661
00:42:38,524 --> 00:42:39,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess not.

662
00:42:39,628 --> 00:42:42,580
Speaker 1: some people early on said it overheated, but it just turned out they were idiots.

663
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:50,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, the DS had a. the DS light has a problem with the GBA cartridge not fitting all the way in.

664
00:42:50,392 --> 00:42:55,620
Speaker 1: Yeah But I mean that one at least is understandable because they they wanted it to be small and that seems to be what people wanted.

665
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:58,112
Speaker 0: Yep, the GBA the screen didn't have a light.

666
00:42:58,474 --> 00:42:59,338
Speaker 0: people complained.

667
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:03,140
Speaker 1: Yeah I remember the penny arcade that came out the day after the GBA came out.

668
00:43:03,902 --> 00:43:09,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the problem with the Wii is that the classic controller is gonna have to plug into the bottom of the normal controller.

669
00:43:09,844 --> 00:43:17,747
Speaker 1: Oh, well, yeah, though from the looks of the virtual console I mean they showed screenshots of where when you play a game It'll show you a screen where it shows.

670
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:20,397
Speaker 1: here's what all the buttons are mapped to and you can probably change them.

671
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:23,268
Speaker 0: Yep The Wii controller is going to rumble.

672
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:24,332
Speaker 0: take that Sony.

673
00:43:24,753 --> 00:43:26,379
Speaker 1: Yeah now think about that.

674
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:33,980
Speaker 1: Not only because it make noise not only is it perfectly tuned spatially to this console, but it rumbles.

675
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:40,860
Speaker 0: So when you get hit, you know, when you hit your sword against the other guy's sword you feel it go and it goes.

676
00:43:42,421 --> 00:43:45,944
Speaker 0: Wow, all right The nunchuck thing.

677
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:47,589
Speaker 0: This is a rumor that was confirmed.

678
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,231
Speaker 0: We'll have.

679
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:51,020
Speaker 0: this will basically be equivalent to the PlayStation 3 controller.

680
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:54,820
Speaker 0: It can't tell where you're aiming it, but it can tell when you tilt it and move it around.

681
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,485
Speaker 0: That's good for a lot of video games.

682
00:43:57,525 --> 00:44:02,338
Speaker 0: I imagine using it to dodge or throw you offhand weapons.

683
00:44:02,438 --> 00:44:08,434
Speaker 0: Yeah Um Then we will have the Opera web browser eventually just like the DS.

684
00:44:08,494 --> 00:44:09,337
Speaker 0: Well real soon.

685
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:10,524
Speaker 1: Yes I'm still.

686
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:12,338
Speaker 1: I really want it for the DS like I am.

687
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:14,048
Speaker 0: I don't know why I need it on the Wii.

688
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,159
Speaker 0: I have a computer plugged into my TV.

689
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,272
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I guess people don't have a computer plugged into their TV.

690
00:44:20,313 --> 00:44:20,995
Speaker 0: This will be useful.

691
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:21,919
Speaker 1: Most people don't.

692
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:28,198
Speaker 0: I mean We're really the minority Yeah, and I guess it'll be really easy to use because you can just aim the Wii controller at the links and click on them.

693
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:35,880
Speaker 0: It also I think will be cool because you'll visit the Nintendo website and such with your Nintendo product.

694
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:39,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they could make some hookups in that department, you know?

695
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,541
Speaker 0: Maybe some sort of web integration sort of like Microsoft has with the Xbox 360.

696
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:50,439
Speaker 0: Here's one that people are seem to be confused about and I'm gonna try to shed as much light as I can as possible.

697
00:44:51,282 --> 00:44:55,717
Speaker 0: We connect 24. the Wii is never gonna be turned off.

698
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,906
Speaker 0: basically You're always gonna have it on.

699
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:01,816
Speaker 0: it'll always be connected to the internet and powered on.

700
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:04,255
Speaker 0: even when you turn it off It'll be a little bit on.

701
00:45:04,276 --> 00:45:04,902
Speaker 1: now I know.

702
00:45:04,922 --> 00:45:16,039
Speaker 1: when the PlayStation 2 came out People had a lot of trouble with the fact that once you plugged it in and turn on that switch in the back It was always on with the you basically just suspended it.

703
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, red light green light, but people didn't understand that and they would always like turn their ps2 off hard Which wasn't good for it?

704
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:23,079
Speaker 0: No, not good at all.

705
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:26,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, though Nintendo is doing a lot more than just leaving it in suspend mode.

706
00:45:27,222 --> 00:45:37,340
Speaker 0: Yes, not only will leaving it in suspend mode allow you to turn it on quicker So boot time will be almost, you know, even less exist and not that there was boot time on GameCube or anything.

707
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,523
Speaker 1: It'll be doing stuff.

708
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:54,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the kind of stuff they talked about is games can get patched and updated and new things will be Unlocked without you having to wait for them because they'll just happen when you're not using the Wii or using the Wii's network connection.

709
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:56,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, say you're online and Nintendo decides.

710
00:45:56,649 --> 00:45:58,536
Speaker 1: All right, because it's uh, I don't know.

711
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:01,960
Speaker 1: pick a holiday Hanukkah Hanukkah Harry.

712
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:02,662
Speaker 1: They're gonna.

713
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:07,979
Speaker 1: they're gonna add a Hanukkah Harry thing to Smash Brothers for anyone who has it and they just do it on Hanukkah.

714
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,593
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they do it the night before Hanukkah.

715
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:15,578
Speaker 0: when you're not playing your Wii Still on and killing the little kids Hanukkah Harry sneaks in.

716
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:15,880
Speaker 0: that's it.

717
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,642
Speaker 1: Whatever he does.

718
00:46:16,843 --> 00:46:26,280
Speaker 0: the example they gave was for Animal Crossing that you would have your Animal Crossing Village I guess would always be sort of on a little bit.

719
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:33,610
Speaker 0: So if someone sent you some Animal Crossing messages while you weren't playing Animal Crossing They would just come in because the Wii is always on.

720
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,468
Speaker 0: so they'd be downloaded whenever and then the next time you play Animal Crossing There they would be.

721
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:38,156
Speaker 0: look at that.

722
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,159
Speaker 1: That's huge, I mean I'm not a fan of those games so much anymore.

723
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:46,000
Speaker 1: Not not so much because I don't think they're cool because I don't have time for that crap.

724
00:46:46,242 --> 00:46:51,516
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't have time for Animal Crossing though I think I might play it once cuz I'm a little bit interested in some of the stuff.

725
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:52,219
Speaker 0: I don't know about it.

726
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are the kind of games that I used to play religiously when I was a kid But now I just I can't do it.

727
00:46:57,775 --> 00:46:58,480
Speaker 0: I can't deal with it.

728
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:00,914
Speaker 1: I can't even deal with like Sim City 2000 anymore.

729
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:01,940
Speaker 1: It just takes too long.

730
00:47:02,241 --> 00:47:04,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just cheat but I think this is huge.

731
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:10,476
Speaker 1: just that the Animal Crossing people and the people who like these games Are a big segment of the market.

732
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:14,470
Speaker 0: now Animal Crossing sold crazy crazy in Japan.

733
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:20,800
Speaker 0: Animal Crossing DS sold crazy in Japan Crazy crazy and it sold really well in the u.s.

734
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,589
Speaker 1: To the fact that people could wirelessly interact.

735
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,259
Speaker 1: their cities was like this crazy thing for people.

736
00:47:27,122 --> 00:47:35,978
Speaker 0: Now with the Wii and the your city is always there and it says on the Nintendo website Something we already knew is that the Wii can connect to the DS.

737
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:37,063
Speaker 0: now They never.

738
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:42,800
Speaker 0: they haven't given example of anyone doing this yet, but they did say that it's technologically possible.

739
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:48,310
Speaker 0: so you can just wait for Animal Crossing DS plus Animal Crossing.

740
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,137
Speaker 0: we kind of action going on.

741
00:47:50,398 --> 00:47:55,700
Speaker 1: or you know The ultimate uber extension of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles where you have a DS.

742
00:47:56,322 --> 00:48:01,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's your TV all wireless and all online with other people.

743
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:05,420
Speaker 0: They'll make some cable that goes from the DS to the bottom of the Wii controller.

744
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,259
Speaker 0: Okay So that's pretty much the story with the Wii.

745
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:13,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's everyone seems to like it.

746
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:13,850
Speaker 1: the games.

747
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:14,853
Speaker 1: They've demoed the games.

748
00:48:14,874 --> 00:48:16,660
Speaker 1: They've got their people are raving about.

749
00:48:17,122 --> 00:48:18,869
Speaker 0: Let's talk about all the games for the Wii.

750
00:48:19,472 --> 00:48:21,299
Speaker 1: All right, they've got this sports game.

751
00:48:21,961 --> 00:48:25,972
Speaker 0: Now my opinion of this sports game is it's it's called Wii Sports.

752
00:48:26,774 --> 00:48:29,000
Speaker 0: It's got tennis golf and baseball.

753
00:48:29,402 --> 00:48:31,590
Speaker 1: I think it's a great idea to have them bundled like this.

754
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,698
Speaker 1: It's very much the see what the we can do.

755
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:33,980
Speaker 1: game.

756
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:43,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's sort of like how you have solitaire that originally came with Microsoft Windows because Everyone had been using DOS and no one knows how to use a mouse.

757
00:48:44,183 --> 00:48:46,135
Speaker 0: So they put out solitaire.

758
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:53,202
Speaker 0: that came with Windows Which you would no doubt want to try right away because it's a game and you would learn how to use the mouse by playing Solitaire.

759
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,088
Speaker 0: Wii Sports is the same thing.

760
00:48:55,128 --> 00:48:58,318
Speaker 0: you learn how to use the wiimote by playing Wii Sports plus.

761
00:48:58,358 --> 00:48:59,442
Speaker 1: it looks fun Mm-hmm.

762
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:03,780
Speaker 0: I really think though they that they should bundle Wii Sports with the Wii.

763
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:05,859
Speaker 0: It should be a free game that comes with the system.

764
00:49:06,623 --> 00:49:09,900
Speaker 0: I mean, this isn't something people are gonna pay 50 bucks for maybe 20 bucks.

765
00:49:10,604 --> 00:49:13,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could see if they don't bundle it selling it for like 15 bucks.

766
00:49:13,821 --> 00:49:18,798
Speaker 0: But think about it every time Nintendo has released a new peripheral that no one knew how to use.

767
00:49:18,818 --> 00:49:21,872
Speaker 0: the zapper They put out duck hunt the super scope.

768
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:23,501
Speaker 0: They came with a super scope 6.

769
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:25,807
Speaker 1: Yep, the power came with Mario Paint.

770
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:27,271
Speaker 0: the mouse came with Mario Paint.

771
00:49:27,692 --> 00:49:29,859
Speaker 0: the power pad came with track and field.

772
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,480
Speaker 0: now This is a new peripheral that's coming with a system.

773
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:35,199
Speaker 0: So it's a little bit different than a peripheral coming out on its own.

774
00:49:35,701 --> 00:49:40,536
Speaker 0: But the wiimote should come with Wii Sports to teach you how to use the wiimote plus.

775
00:49:40,556 --> 00:49:41,860
Speaker 1: think about what that would do in the market.

776
00:49:42,141 --> 00:49:45,015
Speaker 1: It's been a long time since consoles came with games.

777
00:49:45,478 --> 00:49:57,378
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Well, what usually happens nowadays is the original console comes without a game and then later on they release bundle packs Like now if you buy a GameCube, I think it comes with Metroid Prime or something.

778
00:49:57,398 --> 00:49:57,880
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

779
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are different ones you can get like you can get the Pokemon GameCube that comes with Pokemon XD or whatever It's called.

780
00:50:04,465 --> 00:50:07,902
Speaker 1: I just remember when I got my NES and it came with Mario Brothers Duck hunt.

781
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,089
Speaker 0: mine came with Mario Duck hunt and the red zapper.

782
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, red zapper.

783
00:50:11,354 --> 00:50:12,016
Speaker 0: Yeah red zapper.

784
00:50:12,698 --> 00:50:19,728
Speaker 0: All right There's one called project hammer and it's actually made by Nintendo and this game.

785
00:50:19,748 --> 00:50:21,070
Speaker 1: I don't know what to say about this game.

786
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:24,228
Speaker 1: Um All I get things with a hammer.

787
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:28,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, you basically someone said hey, you know, it'd be really awesome.

788
00:50:28,873 --> 00:50:30,500
Speaker 0: If you see you could swing a hammer around.

789
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:32,750
Speaker 0: everyone wants to just run around smashing stuff.

790
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,944
Speaker 0: Let's make a game where all you do is run around smashing shit with a hammer for some reason.

791
00:50:36,984 --> 00:50:40,096
Speaker 1: I keep picturing communist Mario I guess.

792
00:50:40,116 --> 00:50:41,141
Speaker 0: yeah big-ass hammer.

793
00:50:41,161 --> 00:50:42,688
Speaker 0: I think that's what this game is.

794
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:44,735
Speaker 0: There was one game.

795
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:46,220
Speaker 0: I think actually this game.

796
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,744
Speaker 0: They didn't show actual footage of.

797
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:49,570
Speaker 0: I guess I was wrong before.

798
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:57,478
Speaker 0: This is one game where all they showed were pre-rendered FMV's which it was something something disaster Which looked like every disaster movie ever.

799
00:50:57,538 --> 00:50:58,401
Speaker 0: it rolled into one.

800
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:00,167
Speaker 0: I don't know how the game works.

801
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:01,090
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about it.

802
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:04,363
Speaker 0: I think you manage disaster recovery teams or something.

803
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:08,556
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't really look into that one Super Mario Galaxy.

804
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:09,619
Speaker 1: All right, they said.

805
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:10,843
Speaker 1: they've said more than once.

806
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:12,489
Speaker 1: It's not going to be a launch game.

807
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:20,770
Speaker 0: Yep, it's probably gonna come out soon after though It'd be sort of like how Super Mario Brothers wasn't a launch game for the NES.

808
00:51:21,571 --> 00:51:25,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, most people don't really remember shine wasn't a launch game for the GameCube.

809
00:51:25,591 --> 00:51:28,741
Speaker 1: Yeah, the launch game for the GameCube was Luigi's Mansion.

810
00:51:29,022 --> 00:51:31,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is alright, but it wasn't long enough at all.

811
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was definitely more a tech demo than a game.

812
00:51:33,662 --> 00:51:34,084
Speaker 0: Yep.

813
00:51:34,607 --> 00:51:40,190
Speaker 0: Yep But yeah, Super Mario Galaxy looks like a really fun awesome Mario game.

814
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:43,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean just watching the scenes from playing the game.

815
00:51:43,425 --> 00:51:44,350
Speaker 1: It just looks badass.

816
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:50,070
Speaker 0: It looks like they took the good parts of Super Mario Sunshine and left out the bad parts and put them in this game.

817
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:55,254
Speaker 1: You know because the only part I liked about Mario Sunshine really were those QB.

818
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:58,469
Speaker 1: but you know you go you go into the tube or the whatever to the place.

819
00:51:59,053 --> 00:52:01,350
Speaker 0: Yeah secret of the the blankety blank.

820
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:02,515
Speaker 1: Yeah We have to run through.

821
00:52:02,535 --> 00:52:09,090
Speaker 0: there's like a rotating cube and then a bunch of Platforms moving around the part where you didn't have your little water pack and it was all for me.

822
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,174
Speaker 1: I didn't like that water pack.

823
00:52:10,535 --> 00:52:21,550
Speaker 0: No, so this Super Mario Galaxy looks like it's gonna be The you know cool part of Mario Sunshine with using the wiimote, which is plus plus.

824
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,536
Speaker 0: We'll see how it actually turns out.

825
00:52:23,636 --> 00:52:28,630
Speaker 0: All you've seen are some, you know in-game footages, but at least there weren't bull shots.

826
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:31,057
Speaker 1: It looks like it'll be real intuitive to play.

827
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:34,909
Speaker 0: All right next up the ultimate party game not Mario party.

828
00:52:35,471 --> 00:52:37,798
Speaker 0: WarioWare smooth moves now.

829
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:44,159
Speaker 1: way back when WarioWare came out for the Gameboy I thought that looks dumb.

830
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,283
Speaker 0: I didn't think it looks dumb.

831
00:52:45,323 --> 00:52:47,310
Speaker 0: I said that I said that looks interesting.

832
00:52:47,692 --> 00:52:51,089
Speaker 0: It's worth about 10 bucks because a bunch of really really tiny games.

833
00:52:51,832 --> 00:52:56,045
Speaker 1: Once they made the GameCube multiplayer one, that was crazy.

834
00:52:56,065 --> 00:52:57,770
Speaker 1: That was better than Mario Party.

835
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, WarioWare on its own isn't so fun.

836
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,650
Speaker 0: It's just something to sort of pass the time.

837
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:06,265
Speaker 0: Busy work as much as brain games is or any of those other ones.

838
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:10,450
Speaker 0: but WarioWare Multiplayer all of a sudden is an amazing thing.

839
00:53:10,831 --> 00:53:11,534
Speaker 1: I mean all the.

840
00:53:11,574 --> 00:53:17,808
Speaker 1: we have all these memories of going to the shore in Wildwood and sitting around in the beach house Just playing WarioWare long into the night.

841
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:21,210
Speaker 0: It's really no better party game than WarioWare.

842
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:27,570
Speaker 0: So WarioWare with a Wii controller that has you hula dancing and lassoing and jumping and lifting.

843
00:53:28,193 --> 00:53:44,805
Speaker 0: So now instead of four people sitting around with GameCube or Gameboy's Controllers sitting in front of the TV pushing buttons going Oh Wario Which is a lot of fun now people are gonna be dancing around the room Jumping and swinging and all kinds of craziness that I can only imagine.

844
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:47,952
Speaker 1: This is gonna be fantastic All right.

845
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:51,844
Speaker 0: Here's one game that sort of surprised me excite truck.

846
00:53:52,947 --> 00:53:55,412
Speaker 1: It looks fun Apparently.

847
00:53:55,452 --> 00:53:58,322
Speaker 0: when I first saw it I said, oh there's some random truck game.

848
00:53:58,422 --> 00:54:03,008
Speaker 0: then Reggie said it was excite truck and I was like Hahaha, it's a Nintendo game.

849
00:54:03,872 --> 00:54:09,490
Speaker 0: It's you control it with the Wiimote and you tilt the Wiimote to steer the truck and there's a boost button and whatnot.

850
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:18,490
Speaker 1: That's one genre that Nintendo's been lacking for a long time semi realistic or non Mario Kart racing games.

851
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,976
Speaker 0: That's really the reason I want a 360 or a ps3.

852
00:54:20,996 --> 00:54:29,025
Speaker 0: probably a 360 or maybe ps2 is to get the Gran Turismo and the forces and the real racing games.

853
00:54:29,085 --> 00:54:31,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz the Nintendo doesn't have them.

854
00:54:31,755 --> 00:54:35,750
Speaker 1: I mean f-zero was fun and it is a racing game, but it's not that kind of racing game.

855
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:42,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a different kind of racing game that you also need, you know I think burnout is the competitor for f-zero if I'm correct.

856
00:54:43,112 --> 00:55:00,310
Speaker 0: But anyway, this is the another kind of racing game, which is sort of the off-road you know high jump in freewheeling racing game and There really wasn't one of these that was ever any good in my opinion and this one Actually a lot of people at e3 say this is the most fun Wii game they played.

857
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:05,807
Speaker 0: So now my hopes are kind of up on this one where previously they were lukewarm.

858
00:55:06,129 --> 00:55:09,018
Speaker 1: Yeah Now Red Steel.

859
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,265
Speaker 0: Oh, you wanna talk about Red Steel?

860
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:11,070
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about Red Steel.

861
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:14,063
Speaker 0: Red Steel is the game that everyone wants to play.

862
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,349
Speaker 0: It has the longest line at e3.

863
00:55:16,152 --> 00:55:17,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they showed original screenshots.

864
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:20,369
Speaker 1: they talked about the concept and I thought all right, that looks cool.

865
00:55:21,231 --> 00:55:26,320
Speaker 1: Now that I've seen more and more of the gameplay this game looks like it's gonna be bad ass.

866
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:33,068
Speaker 0: It's basically an FPS where you use the wiimote to control the gun and/or the sword sword.

867
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:37,697
Speaker 0: So our sword, yeah Link's gonna have the sword too.

868
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:40,226
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this the game looks like.

869
00:55:40,246 --> 00:55:43,243
Speaker 1: there's a lot of fighting But there's also a lot of like plot.

870
00:55:43,323 --> 00:55:50,990
Speaker 1: figuring things out They said they guess a lot of people have likened it to half-life in terms of the plot is integrated into the game.

871
00:55:51,171 --> 00:55:52,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't see that so much.

872
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:53,833
Speaker 1: I saw that cuz.

873
00:55:53,874 --> 00:56:03,455
Speaker 1: apparently one of the big parts of the game is if you'll be fighting like a boss and you have to Choose it like say you beat him in the sword fight and he's knocked his sword away Do you kill him or spare him?

874
00:56:03,555 --> 00:56:04,598
Speaker 1: and then the consequences?

875
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,902
Speaker 0: that didn't seem.

876
00:56:06,022 --> 00:56:09,756
Speaker 1: when I saw it cuz I watch said specifically that is One of the scenarios in the game.

877
00:56:09,816 --> 00:56:14,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw the scenario in the game and it didn't look to me Like there were any plot consequences.

878
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:15,162
Speaker 0: It was just.

879
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:17,090
Speaker 0: you didn't choose to do either way.

880
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:20,730
Speaker 0: You know you the guy shot the guards and then the boss coward.

881
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:21,211
Speaker 0: Which is it?

882
00:56:22,555 --> 00:56:23,137
Speaker 0: it's less.

883
00:56:23,398 --> 00:56:26,086
Speaker 0: it seemed to me like it was less a thing about plot.

884
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:27,430
Speaker 0: I didn't see plot at all.

885
00:56:28,232 --> 00:56:33,969
Speaker 0: it seemed to me more of the bad guys in the game act like real people as much as they can.

886
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:43,081
Speaker 0: a Big mafia boss if you shoot his guards doesn't keep trying to kill you Like in so many games time cop, etc.

887
00:56:43,121 --> 00:56:43,563
Speaker 0: Etc.

888
00:56:44,105 --> 00:56:45,028
Speaker 0: The mafia boss goes.

889
00:56:45,048 --> 00:56:48,083
Speaker 0: Oh shit This guy just hosed my guards and he carries behind the desk.

890
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:49,570
Speaker 0: That's what it's about.

891
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:50,735
Speaker 1: But I've seen.

892
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:54,330
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of comments from people who played it who said that it looks like it's gonna be like Half-Life.

893
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:56,056
Speaker 1: Many people have said those words.

894
00:56:56,277 --> 00:56:57,662
Speaker 0: All right, we'll see I haven't seen.

895
00:56:57,702 --> 00:56:59,589
Speaker 1: I want to play this game because I don't.

896
00:56:59,609 --> 00:56:59,750
Speaker 1: I want.

897
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:00,377
Speaker 1: I want to see.

898
00:57:00,397 --> 00:57:01,549
Speaker 1: I want to see exactly what it is.

899
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,566
Speaker 0: I think people just want it because it.

900
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:11,837
Speaker 0: you know it's a violent FPS tight game and there aren't any other games in the same genre taking advantage of the wiimote in the same way at This time that we know about.

901
00:57:11,978 --> 00:57:19,950
Speaker 0: well, we'll see, you know, I'm sure that later FPS runaround killing guy games will be much better than Red Steel anyway.

902
00:57:21,012 --> 00:57:23,012
Speaker 0: Metroid Prime 3 Corruption.

903
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,677
Speaker 0: Metroid Prime 1 was awesome.

904
00:57:24,938 --> 00:57:28,570
Speaker 0: Metroid Prime 2 was more of the same which is awesome, but it wasn't more awesome.

905
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:32,228
Speaker 0: Metroid Prime 3 I'm pretty sure will be more awesome.

906
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:38,290
Speaker 0: Hooray, I'll buy every Metroid game no matter what it is pretty much except for Metroid Prime pinball.

907
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:40,722
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was about to say you didn't buy the pinball game.

908
00:57:40,742 --> 00:57:43,895
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna buy the pinball game Five bucks.

909
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:44,598
Speaker 0: Okay.

910
00:57:44,618 --> 00:57:45,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, I buy it for five bucks.

911
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:49,363
Speaker 1: There aren't many games I wouldn't buy for five bucks that are made by Nintendo.

912
00:57:49,463 --> 00:57:53,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Metroid Prime 3 is gonna be awesome.

913
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:58,440
Speaker 0: FFCC we Not so much info on this one.

914
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's going to exist.

915
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:02,850
Speaker 1: Of course, it's also supposed to exist for the DS.

916
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:06,661
Speaker 0: Yep, I hope there's some sort of tie together.

917
00:58:06,681 --> 00:58:08,728
Speaker 1: I really hope I would assume there will be.

918
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:09,995
Speaker 0: There's got to be.

919
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:11,001
Speaker 1: I mean they have.

920
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:18,690
Speaker 1: they've been very and in general Nintendo seems very forward-thinking about their tie togethers and they'll have tie togethers between games that were released fairly far apart.

921
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,854
Speaker 0: Yeah, but none.

922
00:58:19,894 --> 00:58:23,588
Speaker 0: No one is still be in the old Sonic and Knuckles tie together.

923
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:24,250
Speaker 0: No one.

924
00:58:26,731 --> 00:58:27,840
Speaker 0: Resident Evil Wii.

925
00:58:27,861 --> 00:58:31,289
Speaker 1: I Lot of people have said that that looks bad.

926
00:58:31,935 --> 00:58:33,510
Speaker 0: Well a lot of you say the words badass.

927
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:34,875
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing is.

928
00:58:34,936 --> 00:58:38,189
Speaker 0: as far as I know Resident Evil 4 people say was awesome.

929
00:58:39,691 --> 00:58:41,839
Speaker 0: Every Resident Evil is out for the GameCube.

930
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:44,690
Speaker 0: every single Resident Evil ever is available on the GameCube.

931
00:58:45,392 --> 00:58:48,987
Speaker 0: Resident Evil 5 is supposedly gonna be a ps3 exclusive.

932
00:58:49,088 --> 00:58:49,490
Speaker 0: I heard.

933
00:58:50,671 --> 00:58:54,990
Speaker 0: But this I've seen it announced for the ps3 and I haven't seen it announced for the Wii or the GameCube.

934
00:58:56,094 --> 00:59:03,350
Speaker 0: so The question is is Resident Evil Wii Resident Evil 5 with Wii commands or is it a different Resident Evil with Wii command?

935
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:06,084
Speaker 1: I really think it's gonna be a different Resident Evil.

936
00:59:06,285 --> 00:59:06,829
Speaker 0: I think it is.

937
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:10,926
Speaker 1: It's a good move for the people who make Resident Evil because then I'll just sell more games.

938
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:15,497
Speaker 0: Yep I Guess it's gonna be really cool.

939
00:59:15,517 --> 00:59:23,125
Speaker 0: You know, you sneak around the house instead of you know Just the old-school way and then you shoot the zombies and zombies jump out.

940
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:29,716
Speaker 0: and now when you're scared You know if you get scared in a Resident Evil game you go Ah, but you don't you know.

941
00:59:29,957 --> 00:59:39,167
Speaker 0: in your ah shrieking this jiggle the controller and lose your aim But with a wiimote in your hands if you get surprised you might drop that thing on the floor or something.

942
00:59:39,268 --> 00:59:41,505
Speaker 0: Oh my god It's gonna get really good.

943
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:43,907
Speaker 0: Okay, two more Wii games left.

944
00:59:44,812 --> 00:59:48,609
Speaker 0: Trauma Center we aka trauma center.

945
00:59:49,611 --> 00:59:50,294
Speaker 0: Second opinion.

946
00:59:50,334 --> 00:59:51,037
Speaker 0: I think it was called.

947
00:59:51,057 --> 00:59:53,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's a really clever title really clever name.

948
00:59:54,532 --> 00:59:56,658
Speaker 0: The first game for the DS was good.

949
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,386
Speaker 0: It had some problems meaning it was too hard.

950
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:00,590
Speaker 1: It was Nintendo hard.

951
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:05,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if I ever beat that one and I decide I want more of that.

952
01:00:05,986 --> 01:00:14,026
Speaker 0: I'll get the Wii one and the last one The one that I'm looking forward to probably more than any of the others duck hunt Wii.

953
01:00:14,066 --> 01:00:17,409
Speaker 1: Yep Now I've heard rumors that there's no dog in it.

954
01:00:18,172 --> 01:00:19,054
Speaker 0: No, that's.

955
01:00:19,736 --> 01:00:26,016
Speaker 0: I watched a video of it and the video which seemed to be a prototype of duck hunt We and not a complete duck hunt.

956
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:27,100
Speaker 0: We had no dog.

957
01:00:27,321 --> 01:00:29,429
Speaker 1: There'd better be a goddamn dog.

958
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:30,939
Speaker 0: now Here's the thing about duck hunt.

959
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:31,201
Speaker 0: We.

960
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:38,236
Speaker 0: that kind of makes me go in if I'm playing duck hunt we I Really need to have a gun with sights on it.

961
01:00:38,337 --> 01:00:40,362
Speaker 0: now at the Nintendo booth.

962
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:43,070
Speaker 0: There is this sort of display holster.

963
01:00:43,271 --> 01:00:49,222
Speaker 0: They're showing where you insert the Wii controller into it and it gives it a trigger And you hold it like a gun.

964
01:00:49,906 --> 01:00:50,430
Speaker 0: That's pretty cool.

965
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:54,368
Speaker 1: Yeah, because a lot of people speculated that they'd make something like that and sure enough they did.

966
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:54,972
Speaker 0: sure enough They did.

967
01:00:55,013 --> 01:00:55,416
Speaker 0: who knows that?

968
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:59,619
Speaker 0: that'll be the final thing that's available But whatever I'm sure they'll test it.

969
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,830
Speaker 0: a lot thing is the video of duck hunt.

970
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:11,963
Speaker 0: We shows two ducks or a bunch of ducks and targets and clays flying around and two people are trying to shoot them at the Same time which is way cool because now you have competitive duck hunt.

971
01:01:12,726 --> 01:01:19,876
Speaker 0: the thing is You see these crosshairs floating around the screen Now just watching the screen.

972
01:01:19,896 --> 01:01:23,345
Speaker 0: I couldn't really see myself playing duck hunt that way.

973
01:01:23,365 --> 01:01:27,270
Speaker 0: That's really hard to Use a crosshair to kill the ducks.

974
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:29,921
Speaker 0: I really need to have a sight on the Wii controller.

975
01:01:30,142 --> 01:01:32,050
Speaker 1: crosshairs and games like that kind of screw me up.

976
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:33,737
Speaker 0: They screw me up big time.

977
01:01:33,778 --> 01:01:34,079
Speaker 0: They might.

978
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,370
Speaker 0: you know other people might be okay with it.

979
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:44,435
Speaker 0: I might be able to get used to it but if I'm playing a gun game I need to have a sight on the gun and I need to aim at The screen though.

980
01:01:44,476 --> 01:01:45,178
Speaker 1: We'll see.

981
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:48,670
Speaker 1: I mean one if it's a prototype if it changes, or if that's an option.

982
01:01:49,711 --> 01:01:50,577
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

983
01:01:51,462 --> 01:01:52,388
Speaker 0: I just don't tell.

984
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:59,390
Speaker 0: I Don't think the Wii sensor can figure out your screen and if you're aiming exactly at the duck.

985
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:01,940
Speaker 0: So I don't think a sight would actually work on the device.

986
01:02:02,562 --> 01:02:03,144
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

987
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:04,409
Speaker 1: yeah, we'll have to see.

988
01:02:05,332 --> 01:02:07,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure it'll be okay.

989
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:08,625
Speaker 0: I'll play it in a store before I buy it.

990
01:02:09,328 --> 01:02:14,304
Speaker 1: now of course there Was the game they announced after there, oh, yeah, we should probably talk about that.

991
01:02:14,324 --> 01:02:17,479
Speaker 0: you mean the game they announced today Last night.

Speaker 0: I don't remember when they said that Smash Brothers we or Revolution would be a launch title that would be playable online.

995
01:02:35,854 --> 01:02:40,552
Speaker 0: at the Nintendo press conference the other day They didn't say a goddamn thing about Smash Brothers.

996
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:41,135
Speaker 0: not a word.

997
01:02:41,477 --> 01:02:44,249
Speaker 0: when it was over I said where the fuck's the Smash Brothers?

01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:05,400
Speaker 1: looks like the same gameplay.

1007
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:08,246
Speaker 0: It looks like awesome Smash Brothers.

1008
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:12,918
Speaker 0: and of course the key to any Smash Brothers title is the new characters.

1009
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:14,565
Speaker 1: all right They won.

1010
01:03:14,605 --> 01:03:16,112

Speaker 1: All right all right all right fine.

1014
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:28,957

1016
01:03:32,632 --> 01:03:36,668
Speaker 1: all right if there was one character You would like you would have added to this game.

1017
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:37,472
Speaker 1: Who would it be?

1018
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:37,953
Speaker 1: he was like.

1019
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:39,520
Speaker 1: we're still adding characters.

1020
01:03:40,461 --> 01:03:43,168
Speaker 1: Yeah We would add we'd add him.

1021
01:03:43,268 --> 01:03:50,616
Speaker 0: there is a poll going on in Japan Asking the Japanese people what characters to add and people think the poll is gonna come over here next.

1022
01:03:51,439 --> 01:03:56,512
Speaker 1: all right if There are so many characters the thing is they got the character.

1023
01:03:56,572 --> 01:03:58,257
Speaker 1: I wanted the most okay.

1024
01:03:58,277 --> 01:04:00,228
Speaker 0: Let's start with Meta Knight.

1025
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:01,640
Speaker 1: Meta Knight is awesome.

1026
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:04,370
Speaker 0: If you don't know who Meta Knight is you've never played Kirby.

1027
01:04:04,832 --> 01:04:15,260
Speaker 0: Meta Knight is basically this little guy Who is the same shape of Kirby, but he's a knight like with a sword And I don't think he has a shield, but he has a mask and he's really badass.

1028
01:04:16,321 --> 01:04:17,895
Speaker 0: So that's gonna be awesome.

1029
01:04:17,915 --> 01:04:26,000
Speaker 1: that guy yes Pitts Pitt from Kid Icarus a game that is mostly forgotten to Nintendo fans.

1030
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:43,629
Speaker 0: No, this is a game that is very remembered among Nintendo fans but has been neglected just as Metroid was for a while just as Earthbound was and it seems that Nintendo has this trend of a game is long lost and forgotten by Seemingly long lost and forgotten by Nintendo.

1031
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:46,760
Speaker 0: the fans are still desperate for more of this game.

1032
01:04:47,162 --> 01:04:51,060
Speaker 0: They put the character in Smash Brothers, then they released the actual games.

1033
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:54,100
Speaker 0: They put Roy and Marth in Smash Brothers, and they came up with Fire Emblem.

1034
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:57,376
Speaker 0: I would put Samus in Smash Brothers the camel of Metroid Prime.

1035
01:04:57,436 --> 01:04:58,180
Speaker 1: I would bet money.

1036
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:00,599
Speaker 1: There's going to be a new Kid Icarus game on the Wii.

1037
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:04,215
Speaker 0: There's got to be a Kid Icarus game on the Wii where you use the Wiimote to shoot arrows.

1038
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,460
Speaker 1: That's gonna be so awesome.

1039
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:06,484
Speaker 0: It's gonna happen.

1040
01:05:06,525 --> 01:05:07,308
Speaker 0: I can guarantee it.

1041
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:13,331
Speaker 1: Kid Icarus is one of my favorite old games even though I'm not gonna pretend Kid Icarus was hard as fuck.

1042
01:05:13,432 --> 01:05:14,937
Speaker 1: It was harder than holy crap.

1043
01:05:14,997 --> 01:05:15,740
Speaker 0: is that game hard?

1044
01:05:15,961 --> 01:05:19,540
Speaker 1: I never ever beat it legitimately from start to finish.

1045
01:05:19,801 --> 01:05:21,808
Speaker 0: It was just barely beat the first couple levels.

1046
01:05:21,868 --> 01:05:24,075
Speaker 1: legitimately I can get to level 2 - 4. whoa.

1047
01:05:26,281 --> 01:05:27,911
Speaker 0: We should play it and we should good at it.

1048
01:05:27,931 --> 01:05:28,313
Speaker 1: We should.

1049
01:05:28,534 --> 01:05:29,520
Speaker 1: I've tried to get good at it.

1050
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:31,548
Speaker 1: You can't with those freaking gravis game pads.

1051
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:31,950
Speaker 1: We have.

1052
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,817
Speaker 0: we'll go get some Xbox controllers.

1053
01:05:33,877 --> 01:05:38,573
Speaker 1: Yeah We're gonna buy an Xbox controller to play an emulation of an NES game.

1054
01:05:38,593 --> 01:05:40,218
Speaker 0: I find that we'll get an Xbox 360 also.

1055
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,873
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll be able to play Kid Icarus in the virtual console on our Wii.

1056
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:45,740
Speaker 1: You know what I guarantee we will all right.

1057
01:05:46,103 --> 01:05:58,719
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I Got one thing to say about this because actually Scott when there was a quiz on sprites a while ago He did not recognize a character who was from Kid Icarus, which I thought was a travesty.

1058
01:05:59,503 --> 01:06:09,240
Speaker 1: I note that if Pitt is in Super Smash Brothers, I Guarantee I guarantee there is going to be an eggplant wizard somewhere in Super Smash Brothers doing something bad.

1059
01:06:09,621 --> 01:06:10,143
Speaker 0: We'll see.

1060
01:06:10,445 --> 01:06:12,754
Speaker 1: there is going to be some sort of someone gets turned into an egg.

1061
01:06:12,774 --> 01:06:14,079
Speaker 0: Maybe there'll be an eggplant item.

1062
01:06:15,102 --> 01:06:16,352
Speaker 1: That would be awesome.

1063
01:06:16,675 --> 01:06:22,971
Speaker 0: All right Samus without her suit on is now a character in Smash Brothers brawl.

1064
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:25,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's uh, it's hot real hot.

1065
01:06:26,285 --> 01:06:29,572
Speaker 0: I think that might be my new favorite Character to use because they used to use Samus.

1066
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:33,230
Speaker 1: now you Samus without a suit plus Samus without a suit the way that I mean.

1067
01:06:33,471 --> 01:06:37,910
Speaker 1: they showed us straight up what she looks like this time And this is the cloak like the best representation of.

1068
01:06:38,031 --> 01:06:40,400
Speaker 0: we always knew what she looked like since the first Metroid.

1069
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:42,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was such a pixely.

1070
01:06:42,651 --> 01:06:44,640
Speaker 1: All right, it's a barely recognizable.

1071
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:49,440
Speaker 0: So you play Metroid 2 and you see what she looks like and you play Metroid Super Metroid and you see the same.

1072
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,628
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the same but now it's good.

1073
01:06:51,709 --> 01:06:52,271
Speaker 1: It's really good.

1074
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:54,600
Speaker 0: And then we saw in every other Metroid game what she looks like.

1075
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:56,006
Speaker 0: There's no mystery about it.

1076
01:06:56,147 --> 01:06:57,292
Speaker 1: I never saw any of those Metro.

1077
01:06:57,352 --> 01:06:58,336
Speaker 1: I never played any of those.

1078
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,220
Speaker 0: Well, then you suck.

1079
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,486
Speaker 1: I actually don't like Metroid games.

1080
01:07:00,526 --> 01:07:02,617
Speaker 0: every single Metroid game shows you what she looks like.

1081
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:05,349
Speaker 0: in some way I beat much like maybe Metroid pinball.

1082
01:07:05,429 --> 01:07:07,980
Speaker 0: I don't even know because I haven't played the only one I've seen of hers.

1083
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:11,102
Speaker 1: I saw her in Metroid 1 and That's it.

1084
01:07:11,544 --> 01:07:13,993
Speaker 1: I never really played any other Metroid until I got the DS one.

1085
01:07:14,495 --> 01:07:15,880
Speaker 0: Well, she's all over the place.

1086
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:17,839
Speaker 1: I've been playing on zero mission.

1087
01:07:18,841 --> 01:07:19,464
Speaker 1: That's about it.

1088
01:07:19,826 --> 01:07:26,297
Speaker 1: Yep, which is the same as Metroid 1 plus a little bit She had some kind of lightsaber II sword thing that looked cool in the in the FMV.

1089
01:07:26,317 --> 01:07:27,823
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know what that's about.

1090
01:07:27,883 --> 01:07:29,551
Speaker 0: Maybe it'll be in Metroid Prime 3.

1091
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:31,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, gotta throw a sword into every game.

1092
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:34,497
Speaker 0: now that we have We mote gotta put a sword in every game.

1093
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:36,146
Speaker 0: People love swinging sword.

1094
01:07:36,206 --> 01:07:40,824
Speaker 1: at some point is gonna be Luke and Darth Vader fighting and it's gonna be awesome At some point.

1095
01:07:40,844 --> 01:07:41,085
Speaker 0: Yes.

1096
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:41,827
Speaker 0: I'll be Darth Vader.

1097
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,332
Speaker 1: I'll be Darth Vader.

1098
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,560
Speaker 1: Screw you me Darth Vader versus Darth Vader.

1099
01:07:45,741 --> 01:07:50,055
Speaker 0: I'll have to use my nunchuck to give you the you know neck grip of death.

1100
01:07:50,637 --> 01:07:56,600
Speaker 0: All right, so then Wario Wario it might be hard to resist using Wario.

1101
01:07:56,901 --> 01:08:00,672
Speaker 1: Yeah, because not only do they show him a farting in the video.

1102
01:08:00,732 --> 01:08:10,033
Speaker 1: Not only did Scott just fart in my room But in the interview with the Smash Brothers guy They asked the question so is Wario gonna have his fart power?

1103
01:08:10,073 --> 01:08:15,549
Speaker 1: and the answer I believe was of course Somebody asked yeah, where is he?

1104
01:08:15,589 --> 01:08:19,685
Speaker 0: when I have a lot of Wario games and I'm a big Wario fan When does Wario fart?

1105
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:21,173
Speaker 1: He farts a lot in.

1106
01:08:21,193 --> 01:08:22,037
Speaker 1: Wario were touched.

1107
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:28,459
Speaker 1: I know that And I think in some of these story things in the GameCube one it shows him farting.

1108
01:08:28,781 --> 01:08:30,029
Speaker 0: Oh, I never played that GameCube one.

1109
01:08:30,049 --> 01:08:31,437
Speaker 0: I heard it was actually kind of bad.

1110
01:08:31,598 --> 01:08:32,363
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I don't know.

1111
01:08:32,384 --> 01:08:33,877
Speaker 0: I got to go play it and find out.

1112
01:08:35,024 --> 01:08:36,953
Speaker 0: It's probably really cheap now, but you'll get it cuz.

1113
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:42,953
Speaker 1: they also asked in the interview Does Samus suitless Samus have any fart power?

1114
01:08:43,576 --> 01:08:44,460
Speaker 1: and then everyone laughed?

1115
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:50,613
Speaker 0: Okay, I think that's it for the Wii, um now there's one more character.

1116
01:08:50,654 --> 01:08:51,416
Speaker 1: now the video.

1117
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:52,479
Speaker 0: right the video.

1118
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,759
Speaker 1: They showed and I have a sad anecdote from my work about this.

1119
01:08:56,602 --> 01:09:01,779
Speaker 1: But they showed the video of all these characters and then it ended but the lights didn't come on.

1120
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:15,836
Speaker 1: And then it showed Some Metal Gear action of like Solid Snake talking to someone on the radio as Solid Snake is wanted And then it shows Solid Snake in his box in Smash Brothers.

1121
01:09:15,876 --> 01:09:17,399
Speaker 1: And yes, he's a character in Smash Brothers.

1122
01:09:17,682 --> 01:09:18,769
Speaker 0: Oh my god, Solid Snake.

1123
01:09:19,051 --> 01:09:24,496
Speaker 1: apparently this isn't a matter they had people asked a lot like so did you ask Kojima or how did this happen?

1124
01:09:24,857 --> 01:09:25,359
Speaker 1: and they were like.

1125
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:28,636
Speaker 1: Kojima begged us to have him in the first one for the GameCube.

1126
01:09:28,676 --> 01:09:31,974
Speaker 1: It was just too late So we promised we'd put it in the next one and now we did.

1127
01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:33,241
Speaker 1: oh my god Like.

1128
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:36,700
Speaker 1: they wanted Solid Snake in it and Kojima wanted Solid Snake in it.

1129
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:45,348
Speaker 1: no one involved did not want Solid Snake in this game and The best part is that at work There's this one guy at work whose son is really interested.

1130
01:09:45,488 --> 01:09:46,352
Speaker 0: who's Solid Snake.

1131
01:09:46,913 --> 01:09:48,479
Speaker 0: I said, why is that guy in a box?

1132
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,635
Speaker 1: I said hit Solid Snake and Meta Knight are the new characters of Smash Brothers.

1133
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:53,519
Speaker 1: and he said who?

1134
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I said pit from Kid Icarus.

1135
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:59,040
Speaker 1: He said what I said, you probably don't know who Meta Knight is.

1136
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:02,453
Speaker 1: He said no, and then I said Solid Snake, you know Metal Gear Solid.

1137
01:10:02,473 --> 01:10:06,523
Speaker 1: and he said, oh you mean snake Solid Snake.

1138
01:10:07,185 --> 01:10:13,766
Speaker 1: these newfangled kids have no I they don't recognize him as Solid Snake because in the games The voice acting.

1139
01:10:13,786 --> 01:10:14,790
Speaker 1: they just call him snake.

1140
01:10:14,891 --> 01:10:17,060
Speaker 1: Usually they don't call him Solid Snake every time.

1141
01:10:17,902 --> 01:10:20,880
Speaker 1: So when I said Solid Snake had no idea who was the other guy Super Joe?

1142

Speaker 0: Yep.

1162
01:10:55,036 --> 01:10:56,020
Speaker 0: One last thing about the Wii.

1163
01:10:56,403 --> 01:11:05,391
Speaker 0: I just saw a video online Where a guy took a camera and went from the beginning to the end of the line To for all the people waiting to use a Wii.

1164
01:11:05,592 --> 01:11:07,338
Speaker 1: we have two things to say about this video.

1165
01:11:07,418 --> 01:11:10,780
Speaker 0: number one The line was insanely long.

1166
01:11:10,981 --> 01:11:16,180
Speaker 1: The video is over two minutes long and it moves and kind of fast-forward walking down the line.

1167
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:19,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's a long line.

1168
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:20,072
Speaker 0: See it for yourself.

1169
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:22,440
Speaker 0: Just search go on YouTube and search for a Wii line.

1170
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,047
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll put it on the forum.

1171
01:11:24,389 --> 01:11:29,828
Speaker 1: number two the sheer number of DS's seen in the line is staggering.

1172
01:11:29,848 --> 01:11:32,056
Speaker 0: there are probably more DS's in the line.

1173
01:11:32,297 --> 01:11:33,079
Speaker 0: then there were wheeze.

1174
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,244
Speaker 0: They were waiting to play.

1175
01:11:34,264 --> 01:11:38,218
Speaker 1: there are probably more DS's in line than there are people at every other booth at e3.

1176
01:11:39,303 --> 01:11:41,915
Speaker 0: No, I don't think so at any given at any booth.

1177
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,128
Speaker 1: I Could make a semantic argument at any little booth.

1178
01:11:45,429 --> 01:11:45,690
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1179
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:48,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I didn't see a single PSP in a line.

1180
01:11:48,861 --> 01:11:50,714
Speaker 1: Of course, it was hard to tell for sure.

1181
01:11:50,734 --> 01:11:51,439
Speaker 1: It was hard.

1182
01:11:51,923 --> 01:11:53,171
Speaker 1: PSPs are all black and stealthy.

1183
01:11:53,191 --> 01:11:53,976
Speaker 1: We might not have seen it.

1184
01:11:54,117 --> 01:11:54,640
Speaker 0: That is true.

1185
01:11:54,761 --> 01:11:56,892
Speaker 0: There could have been PSPs in the line that we're hiding.

1186
01:11:57,515 --> 01:11:58,420
Speaker 1: However, it's weird.

1187
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,433
Speaker 1: You can you let's think you can tell the DS people because there's always.

1188
01:12:01,453 --> 01:12:15,554
Speaker 0: you didn't even need to know they had DS's because you see six guys standing in a circle facing each other with their shoulders hunched Shoulders up and their hands up near their torsos and you know They all have DS's and they're playing Mario Kart slash Tetris slash something.

1189
01:12:15,575 --> 01:12:16,377
Speaker 1: Yep, and we paused.

1190
01:12:16,418 --> 01:12:17,040
Speaker 1: it wants to check in.

1191
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,806
Speaker 1: Yep, look the DS is all around.

1192
01:12:19,227 --> 01:12:21,594
Speaker 1: Yep, but seriously this line.

1193
01:12:21,614 --> 01:12:22,598
Speaker 0: No god.

1194
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:23,340
Speaker 0: This line was long.

1195
01:12:23,842 --> 01:12:27,736
Speaker 1: I've stood in shorter lines to ride crazy new roller coasters at Cedar Point.

1196
01:12:27,857 --> 01:12:30,589
Speaker 0: to be perfectly honest No matter how much I want to use the Wii.

1197
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:32,540
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have waited in that line.

1198
01:12:33,242 --> 01:12:42,450
Speaker 0: I would have gone and with like a little binocular to get looks at all the games from far away and I wouldn't have actually gone to use a Wii.

1199
01:12:42,511 --> 01:12:47,980
Speaker 0: I might have gone to use some DS's and the Nintendo booth and Go look at the other things in the Nintendo booth.

1200
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:51,238
Speaker 1: I would have been like that one guy who said I'm just gonna do everything else at e3.

1201
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:53,530
Speaker 0: Yep Absolutely everything else.

1202
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:59,620
Speaker 0: plus if I went to e3 The stuff that I would want to look at the most isn't the major stuff that you're gonna see on the internet.

1203
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:08,985
Speaker 0: It's all that little stuff in the back alleys with all the independent developers that you'll never ever ever see coverage of anywhere All the secret stuff.

1204
01:13:09,226 --> 01:13:13,960
Speaker 1: That's why you're not gonna go see Paris Hilton talking about her new game her new cell phone game.

1205
01:13:14,063 --> 01:13:16,909
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, let's talk about Microsoft.

1206
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,939
Speaker 1: All right, they put out a surprisingly good show.

1207
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:29,698
Speaker 0: yeah, I thought that Microsoft was going to just announce a bunch of new games like Halo 3 and shit and That would be that because their consoles already out and it's already done.

1208
01:13:30,881 --> 01:13:34,513
Speaker 0: First everyone expected they announced the HD DVD player.

1209
01:13:34,553 --> 01:13:43,380
Speaker 0: They didn't say how much it's gonna cost or anything But it's gonna be an HD DVD player that you can buy and plug into your Xbox 360 to watch HD DVDs.

1210
01:13:43,641 --> 01:13:50,480
Speaker 1: Yep, there's been speculation that'll be between a hundred and maybe two hundred dollars at most which is cheaper than an HD DVD player.

1211
01:13:50,721 --> 01:13:52,326
Speaker 0: But of course you have to add the price of a 360.

1212
01:13:52,326 --> 01:13:56,620
Speaker 1: the thing is that's still cheaper than an HD DVD player.

1213
01:13:57,041 --> 01:14:07,573
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is if you already have a 360 from last year and the HD DVD player comes out holiday season this year If you're looking and you already have a 360, are you gonna buy a ps3?

1214
01:14:07,613 --> 01:14:09,580
Speaker 0: Are you gonna buy the HD DVD player?

1215
01:14:10,783 --> 01:14:13,580
Speaker 1: Wait a minute is the chance blu-ray will succeed and then you have to buy it.

1216
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,268
Speaker 0: Anyway, there is also a chance.

1217
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:25,380
Speaker 0: maybe Microsoft will release new 360s that have HD DVD players built in instead which I think would be really smart of them to do like starting next year.

1218
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:32,734
Speaker 0: Right, you know making the new premium bundle have the HD DVD player Because by then the price of HD DVD will come down a lot.

1219
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:39,460
Speaker 0: then bring the old Premium down in price and then I would buy the old premium at that point because I don't need an HD DVD player.

1220
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,509
Speaker 0: You know That's not something they said they would do.

1221
01:14:42,529 --> 01:14:44,099
Speaker 0: that's something I said they should do just now.

1222
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:48,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway the the game the list of games that they came out with in addition to all the other stuff.

1223
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:55,000
Speaker 1: It really is enough for us to at least for me to consider when the second gen of the Xbox 360.

1224
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,610
Speaker 0: Well, one of those games was kind of bled.

1225
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:58,292
Speaker 0: but we'll get to that.

1226
01:14:58,573 --> 01:15:00,440
Speaker 0: Let's talk about the rest of the system stuff first.

1227
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,140
Speaker 0: All right There's gonna be a camera sort of like the eye toy.

1228
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:06,326
Speaker 0: Now what's the use of that?

1229
01:15:06,787 --> 01:15:10,200
Speaker 0: Well, obviously they could potentially make eye toy like games.

1230
01:15:10,682 --> 01:15:15,180
Speaker 1: Obviously when I'm playing Halo there will be a picture of my penis on my guy.

1231
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:17,073
Speaker 0: Obviously, no, it's a video.

1232
01:15:17,094 --> 01:15:17,740
Speaker 0: It's like a webcam.

1233
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:21,874
Speaker 0: So as you're playing Halo people, you know, you push the button to talk.

1234
01:15:22,094 --> 01:15:23,480
Speaker 0: people can see you talking.

1235
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:26,127
Speaker 1: We'll see how well that gets used.

1236
01:15:26,247 --> 01:15:30,639
Speaker 1: how many people are just gonna be naked or the cameras pointing at a penis, you know It's gonna be awesome.

1237
01:15:32,649 --> 01:15:35,386
Speaker 0: a Wireless headset now.

1238
01:15:35,688 --> 01:15:42,624
Speaker 0: right now the headset for the Xbox 360 I think is wired and it's kind of you know It's like a big headset.

1239
01:15:43,186 --> 01:15:47,560
Speaker 0: this thing looks more like one of the Bluetooth headsets for a cell phone.

1240
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:50,196
Speaker 0: We're just goes on one ear and a little tiny microphone.

1241
01:15:50,216 --> 01:15:50,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's cool.

1242
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:55,920
Speaker 1: It's not anything special or innovative in and of itself, but it's definitely the next step in terms of technology.

1243
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:03,120
Speaker 0: It's a significant improvement to the current Xbox 360 headset and the headset is very key to the Xbox Live experience.

1244
01:16:03,382 --> 01:16:06,200
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean for whatever anyone has to say about Microsoft.

1245
01:16:06,902 --> 01:16:09,251
Speaker 1: Xbox Live is a very slick thing.

1246
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:10,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, very slick.

1247
01:16:10,757 --> 01:16:15,320
Speaker 1: I mean I Early on I remember, you know Microsoft is making a console.

1248
01:16:16,961 --> 01:16:21,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was the same way and even penny arcade were like Microsoft is making a console.

1249
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:22,296
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

1250
01:16:22,336 --> 01:16:23,600
Speaker 0: This thing is gigantic.

1251
01:16:24,023 --> 01:16:25,494
Speaker 0: Controllers are terrible.

1252
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:26,340
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

1253
01:16:27,201 --> 01:16:31,600
Speaker 1: But really the Xbox Live is cool and it's pretty well done.

1254
01:16:32,242 --> 01:16:40,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like the in the original Xbox and currently there really aren't so many games I want to play besides the racing games for it.

1255
01:16:40,656 --> 01:16:50,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but The way Xbox Live works it, you know It's sort of like the Nintendo Wi-Fi and that just having it there really adds a lot to the games.

1256
01:16:50,887 --> 01:16:54,547
Speaker 0: But it seemed to me like the ps3 Internet thing.

1257
01:16:54,668 --> 01:17:09,160
Speaker 0: might you know be similar but from what it looked like that was more of a push for Sony's content their movies and music and They did a lot more of that and a lot less of the gaming type stuff.

1258
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sony really hyped up the.

1259
01:17:10,725 --> 01:17:14,737
Speaker 1: you'll be able to download things to your Pia or your ps3 to watch.

1260
01:17:15,058 --> 01:17:19,814
Speaker 0: Yep Well Microsoft supposedly is gonna have downloadable HD movie type stuff too.

1261
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:20,215
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1262
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:25,702
Speaker 1: Well, my analysis is this SOE Sony online entertainment is Crap.

1263
01:17:25,943 --> 01:17:28,934
Speaker 0: Well Sony online entertainment is the company that does ever quest.

1264
01:17:29,014 --> 01:17:36,336
Speaker 1: that has nothing to do with the PlayStation Yeah, but they will have something to do possibly with the online functionality the ps3.

1265
01:17:36,436 --> 01:17:37,098
Speaker 0: No one said that.

1266
01:17:37,118 --> 01:17:39,245
Speaker 0: where you getting there from I'll find the link there.

1267
01:17:39,265 --> 01:17:41,795
Speaker 1: Someone was talking about the developers from them or something.

1268
01:17:41,855 --> 01:17:51,940
Speaker 0: Maybe they're making an MMO That'll be on the ps3 because all Sony online entertainment does is make MMOs Like Star Wars galaxies and ever quest and shit and they got to make an MMO for this thing.

1269
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,027
Speaker 0: Maybe probably but I don't.

1270
01:17:54,248 --> 01:17:57,560
Speaker 0: no one said they have anything to do with the Sony internet ness.

1271
01:17:57,841 --> 01:17:59,448
Speaker 1: I think it was a comment on slashdot.

1272
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:01,517
Speaker 0: Maybe someone doesn't know what they're talking about.

1273
01:18:01,537 --> 01:18:02,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

1274
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:02,902
Speaker 0: Alright.

1275
01:18:02,922 --> 01:18:07,737
Speaker 0: now here's the best thing about the Xbox 360 in Scott's opinion the best thing.

1276
01:18:07,797 --> 01:18:08,680
Speaker 0: remember how they were taught.

1277
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,207
Speaker 0: I was talking about how all I really want is racing games.

1278
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:15,439
Speaker 0: They got this official Xbox 360 wireless wheel coming it.

1279
01:18:16,973 --> 01:18:25,900
Speaker 0: It's cool It's a really really good racing wheel and most systems in the past have had racing wheels that you could buy.

1280
01:18:26,962 --> 01:18:32,000
Speaker 0: The problem is is that the racing wheels are almost always third-party the GameCube and PlayStation.

1281
01:18:32,181 --> 01:18:34,770
Speaker 0: I think those actually a logitech racing wheel.

1282
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:46,079
Speaker 0: that was labeled the official racing wheel But it's still a third-party product The kind of useless and crap or not really well-tuned and not every game supports it properly.

1283
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:57,939
Speaker 0: but Microsoft releasing an official racing wheel is gonna mean that the major racing games which are Forza and Project Gotham and some others are going to support this wheel properly now.

1284
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:01,611
Speaker 1: This is big because I like I like realistic racing games.

1285
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:04,279
Speaker 1: Forza is very realistic as it is.

1286
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:10,400
Speaker 1: If they have a wheel that is calibrated to that game and the developers made the game with that wheel in mind.

1287
01:19:10,983 --> 01:19:11,646
Speaker 1: That's gold.

1288
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:12,772
Speaker 1: It's gold Jerry.

1289
01:19:13,053 --> 01:19:13,314
Speaker 0: Yep.

1290
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:13,475
Speaker 0: Now.

1291
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:14,440
Speaker 0: Here's the thing about the wheel.

1292
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:21,452
Speaker 0: It's like a typical racing wheel you clamp it down to a table, but you don't need to Plug it in to your system or anything.

1293
01:19:21,492 --> 01:19:22,075
Speaker 0: It's wireless.

1294
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:23,200
Speaker 1: Oh wireless.

1295
01:19:23,682 --> 01:19:25,168
Speaker 0: I think it might need a battery or two.

1296
01:19:25,188 --> 01:19:27,960
Speaker 1: It'll have to because it's I almost guarantee it'll have force feedback.

1297
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, here's the thing about the force feedback.

1298
01:19:30,587 --> 01:19:33,749
Speaker 0: All right It will rumble and whatnot with just the battery.

1299
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:41,160
Speaker 0: and there are pedals too that are also wireless and I guess those need a battery As well if you wanted to have actual force feedback.

1300
01:19:42,221 --> 01:19:47,240
Speaker 0: Right now people are saying you need to plug it into a power outlet to get the force feedback to work.

1301
01:19:47,342 --> 01:19:56,638
Speaker 0: No, that's a minus But at least you don't have to plug it into the system Which means you can still sit all the way across the room as long as there's an outlet on your side of the room and At least that is optional.

1302
01:19:57,341 --> 01:20:01,900
Speaker 0: Yep, so if you can't find an outlet near you you can still drive.

1303
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,569
Speaker 0: You just won't have your awesome force feed watch.

1304
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:04,935
Speaker 1: your house doesn't have the holes.

1305
01:20:05,398 --> 01:20:06,460
Speaker 0: the holes Jerry.

1306
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:09,826
Speaker 1: It's been Seinfeld day for us.

1307
01:20:09,867 --> 01:20:11,132
Speaker 1: We've just been making some of course.

1308
01:20:11,172 --> 01:20:13,100
Speaker 0: He made the same holes joke two or three times.

1309
01:20:13,422 --> 01:20:15,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, we made it during the day all day holes jokes.

1310
01:20:15,761 --> 01:20:20,260
Speaker 0: So Scott is all about the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3 for racing games.

1311
01:20:20,681 --> 01:20:24,334
Speaker 0: The Xbox 360 looks to be the cheaper more realistic solution.

1312
01:20:24,535 --> 01:20:25,840
Speaker 0: and now it has a racing wheel.

1313
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:28,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus plus plus for Scott now.

1314
01:20:28,611 --> 01:20:30,880
Speaker 1: There's also a lot of talk about this shadow run game.

1315
01:20:31,761 --> 01:20:36,200
Speaker 0: We're not getting to the shadow run game yet, why not cuz we're not done talking about this system.

1316
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:36,926
Speaker 0: What else is there?

1317
01:20:36,946 --> 01:20:38,640
Speaker 1: I didn't see anything else that I didn't.

1318
01:20:40,283 --> 01:20:45,079
Speaker 1: You didn't look at other stuff cuz I didn't care about much beyond racing games and shadow run.

1319
01:20:45,139 --> 01:20:47,974
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, there's gonna be this thing called live anywhere.

1320
01:20:47,994 --> 01:20:48,095
Speaker 0: where?

1321
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,831
Speaker 0: Xbox live will not just be for the Xbox.

1322
01:20:53,012 --> 01:20:55,080
Speaker 0: It's actually Microsoft Live, I guess.

1323
01:20:55,321 --> 01:20:57,147
Speaker 0: Oh, no, Microsoft Live is that other thing?

1324
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:58,211
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1325
01:20:58,311 --> 01:20:59,214
Speaker 1: So what are they gonna call it?

1326
01:20:59,656 --> 01:21:07,840
Speaker 0: It's called live anywhere And what it's gonna do is basically integrate your live account across your phone and your Windows Vista computer and everything.

1327
01:21:09,162 --> 01:21:17,689
Speaker 0: And what they showed using this was that they were gonna do simultaneous releases of you know the same game on Vista and the Xbox at the same time

1328
01:21:17,709 --> 01:21:17,909
Speaker 1: and

1329
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:25,260
Speaker 0: The things they talked about were people playing Halo 2 on the computer and on the Xbox competing against each other.

1330
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:32,481
Speaker 1: Well, that's the end of people playing FPS is on the console because the PC people just kick their asses with the keyboard and a Mouse.

1331
01:21:32,923 --> 01:21:33,987
Speaker 0: well, they said.

1332
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:38,880
Speaker 0: in fact, this is a quote from the Microsoft guy will settle What's better the keyboard mouse?

1333
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:40,726
Speaker 0: Once and for all.

1334
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:47,920
Speaker 0: and they showed a screen where you know as a list of guys Joining a game and some of them had PC icons and some of them at Xbox icons.

1335
01:21:48,502 --> 01:21:53,805
Speaker 0: hmm, it seems like Microsoft is really going to Integrate its.

1336
01:21:54,126 --> 01:22:01,040
Speaker 0: you know, the Xbox is pretty much going to be a Windows gaming machine and Vista is also going to be capable of being a Windows gaming.

1337
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:07,660
Speaker 1: Well from a business perspective, they really have to do something like this because despite the fact that the Xbox does really well It does lose some money.

1338
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:18,772
Speaker 1: I mean if they sunk a lot of money in R&D into the Xbox Franchise the one the first one at least yeah, and the second one will probably make money because now it's the second gen is popular But they're still subsidizing the hardware most likely.

1339
01:22:18,792 --> 01:22:21,604
Speaker 1: Well, everyone's subsidize the hardware Yeah, but they may be.

1340
01:22:21,886 --> 01:22:24,296
Speaker 1: I mean there's speculation that they make the money back games.

1341
01:22:24,376 --> 01:22:25,300
Speaker 0: It's a razor blade deal.

1342
01:22:25,522 --> 01:22:30,734
Speaker 1: But as far as Vista There's a lot of talk that Vista isn't going to do so.

1343
01:22:30,794 --> 01:22:35,459
Speaker 1: well for a number I mean the corporations aren't really jumping over themselves to get this thing.

1344
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:38,730
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing PC games are kind of going Blair.

1345
01:22:39,252 --> 01:22:40,938
Speaker 0: All right, we've talked about this before.

1346
01:22:41,058 --> 01:22:43,064
Speaker 0: Yep People like me.

1347
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:48,660
Speaker 0: Oh and a lot of other people are going to max and they're going to Linux because Windows is kind of Blair.

1348
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:55,500
Speaker 0: But the only thing we really want Windows 4 is the games and so we keep Windows around for those games.

1349
01:22:56,221 --> 01:23:06,447
Speaker 0: Super hardcore gamer guys are always gonna do the super PC game thing with two video cards and crazy processors and Alienware machines Just because there's no way.

1350
01:23:06,567 --> 01:23:08,272
Speaker 1: Alienware you mean Dell machines.

1351
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:09,055
Speaker 0: All right.

1352
01:23:09,075 --> 01:23:14,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, Dell XPS machines Which is actually what Microsoft used or had on stage for their demos.

1353
01:23:14,596 --> 01:23:18,703
Speaker 0: Yeah What Was I saying?

1354
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:27,372
Speaker 0: right because the PC will always have better graphics it'll always a better frame rate It'll always have all that stuff for all those games.

1355
01:23:27,994 --> 01:23:29,940
Speaker 0: and that's what this ultra hardcore guys do.

1356
01:23:30,061 --> 01:23:30,323
Speaker 0: I mean.

1357
01:23:30,746 --> 01:23:32,520
Speaker 0: who's the most famous gamer in the world?

1358
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,145
Speaker 0: What's his name Thresh?

1359
01:23:35,546 --> 01:23:36,288
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

1360
01:23:36,569 --> 01:23:38,375
Speaker 0: the fatality guy Wow.

1361
01:23:38,495 --> 01:23:39,237
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

1362
01:23:39,257 --> 01:23:40,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, and what does he do?

1363
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,324
Speaker 0: He plays PC games.

1364
01:23:41,364 --> 01:23:44,376
Speaker 0: He doesn't play Nintendo games or PlayStation games or Xbox games.

1365
01:23:44,496 --> 01:23:45,440
Speaker 0: plays PC games.

1366
01:23:45,661 --> 01:23:47,634
Speaker 1: To me the most famous gamer is I eat poo.

1367
01:23:48,258 --> 01:23:53,053
Speaker 1: Yeah I heard he got knocked off the top.

1368
01:23:53,435 --> 01:23:54,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone beat him.

1369
01:23:54,705 --> 01:24:03,000
Speaker 0: Oh, no but I mean look if you look around the world to consoles are really big in Japan in the US and Different consoles are big in different parts of the world.

1370
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:06,631
Speaker 0: But console South Korea is pretty much PC game land.

1371
01:24:06,751 --> 01:24:08,015
Speaker 0: China PC game land.

1372
01:24:08,095 --> 01:24:09,579
Speaker 0: Europe mostly PC game land.

1373
01:24:10,141 --> 01:24:11,890
Speaker 1: South America Sega Genesis land.

1374
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:13,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, China PC game land.

1375
01:24:14,643 --> 01:24:35,080
Speaker 0: PC games are big internationally and Microsoft is doing two things that are really helping this out People like us who really like PC games But don't have windows anymore and there aren't enough PC games to really justify us having a Windows PC that cost a hajillion dollars.

1376
01:24:35,702 --> 01:24:40,520
Speaker 0: The Xbox 360 is becoming the just Windows games machine now.

1377
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:44,714
Speaker 1: This is part of the reason I'm really thinking about getting one as time goes on.

1378
01:24:45,095 --> 01:24:46,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not something I'll get right away.

1379
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:49,237
Speaker 0: It's maybe something we'll get on the first price drop or two.

1380
01:24:50,063 --> 01:24:55,297
Speaker 0: You know, I mean if I get a Wii and rim gets into 360 Then it'll be fair deal unlike when I got a GameCube and he got a nothing.

1381
01:24:55,659 --> 01:24:57,285
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah thing is I don't.

1382
01:24:57,305 --> 01:25:01,500
Speaker 1: I don't know if I would buy an Xbox unless we're in 50/50 because it's still a lot of money.

1383
01:25:02,003 --> 01:25:02,486
Speaker 1: I'm cheap.

1384
01:25:02,908 --> 01:25:03,794
Speaker 1: I'm a cheap bastard.

1385
01:25:03,935 --> 01:25:11,546
Speaker 1: You are real cheap But the point is my investment into the Wii is going to consist of me buying myself a controller Like I did for the GameCube.

1386
01:25:11,586 --> 01:25:12,992
Speaker 1: I have my controller and that's it.

1387
01:25:13,434 --> 01:25:14,257
Speaker 0: Mine's gonna be green.

1388
01:25:14,277 --> 01:25:15,827
Speaker 1: now Mine's gonna be green.

1389
01:25:15,888 --> 01:25:17,380
Speaker 0: Well, we're gonna get confused, aren't we?

1390
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:21,179
Speaker 0: But the other thing I was talking about international ness.

1391
01:25:22,003 --> 01:25:33,660
Speaker 0: they're going to have Microsoft Live whatnot and Xboxes sold in South Africa Chile India Brazil Poland Hungary the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

1392
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:42,900
Speaker 0: Those countries are Notorious for complaining about getting games way after everyone else and having a lot of gamers in them.

1393
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,036
Speaker 1: They're mostly ignored by the entire gaming industry.

1394
01:25:46,056 --> 01:25:48,567
Speaker 0: Well, they're not ignored It's just they're delayed like Pete.

1395
01:25:48,587 --> 01:25:50,415
Speaker 0: There's a lot of gamers in South Africa.

1396
01:25:50,475 --> 01:25:51,500
Speaker 0: Like I've heard podcast.

1397
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,948
Speaker 0: Well, they're always in gamers.

1398
01:25:52,968 --> 01:25:54,095
Speaker 1: They're not the target.

1399
01:25:54,135 --> 01:25:54,900
Speaker 1: They're a secondary.

1400
01:25:55,081 --> 01:25:59,260
Speaker 0: Just there aren't enough people there to have the stuff shipped as early as everyone else.

1401
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,340
Speaker 0: So they get stuff months and months and months even after Europe gets them.

1402
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Europe gets stuff late and overpriced as it is.

1403
01:26:06,469 --> 01:26:12,853
Speaker 0: So now Microsoft pretty much the only company who could do this is Because you know, you can get PC games to any.

1404
01:26:12,933 --> 01:26:14,120
Speaker 0: that's the thing about PC games.

1405
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,447
Speaker 0: They get everywhere all at once.

1406
01:26:15,487 --> 01:26:16,151
Speaker 0: look at steam.

1407
01:26:16,352 --> 01:26:20,640
Speaker 0: Everyone gets half-life 2 at the same time It gets it in every language in every country.

1408
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:25,119
Speaker 0: That's why you always end up fighting some Dutch guy and CS or some Swedish guy and they kick your ass.

1409
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:38,799
Speaker 0: Microsoft is gonna get Xbox out to all those countries at the same time and some people might have Vista and they'll just play on their PC and some people have a 360 and play on their 360 if they're poor and that's gonna be big.

1410
01:26:39,542 --> 01:26:41,067
Speaker 0: You know your DS.

1411
01:26:41,107 --> 01:26:42,512
Speaker 0: it says play worldwide.

1412
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:44,900
Speaker 0: that just means play against guys in Japan in Britain.

1413
01:26:45,362 --> 01:26:48,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Xbox Live is gonna really be worldwide play.

1414
01:26:48,977 --> 01:26:51,167
Speaker 0: It's you know PC gaming.

1415
01:26:51,188 --> 01:26:54,545
Speaker 0: I don't think we'll see a big resurgence But what it'll be is they'll be.

1416
01:26:54,566 --> 01:27:07,480
Speaker 0: the third platform will be Windows gaming as opposed to PC gaming and you'll be able to do your Windows gaming on a 360 or on a PC with Vista and I'll probably not do it on a PC with Vista because Vista is not gonna be good.

1417
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:15,651
Speaker 0: Yeah for a lot of reasons that we talked about and a PC with Vista will be a lot more money than an Xbox Which is only going to go down in price from here on out now.

1418
01:27:15,711 --> 01:27:22,760
Speaker 1: It's interesting that Nintendo, you know Obvious what their strategies are and it looks very interesting and Microsoft is doing this sort of thing.

1419
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,492
Speaker 1: Sony's not really doing anything new.

1420
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:26,680
Speaker 1: They're just doing more of the same.

1421
01:27:27,182 --> 01:27:32,060
Speaker 0: Well, I think Sony's strategy is to you know, be what everyone else is all-in-one.

1422
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,441
Speaker 0: They're like we're gonna be the Wii and the 360.

1423
01:27:34,441 --> 01:27:39,460
Speaker 0: We can do everything that everyone else does and beat them all because the problem is is they're doing there.

1424
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:44,964
Speaker 0: It's basically a shitty Wii plus a shitty 360 Combined in.

1425
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:48,399
Speaker 1: add a lot of horsepower power of shit power of obsolescence.

1426
01:27:48,988 --> 01:27:51,862
Speaker 0: Hahaha You know.

1427
01:27:52,163 --> 01:27:54,611
Speaker 1: and I got a rip on the ps3 one more time.

1428
01:27:54,952 --> 01:27:57,499
Speaker 1: God day it if you've seen pictures of it.

1429
01:27:57,961 --> 01:28:01,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looked that someone described it as a Victorian era waffle iron.

1430
01:28:02,116 --> 01:28:03,300
Speaker 1: It's bigger than the Xbox.

1431
01:28:03,701 --> 01:28:05,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's real big and real heavy.

1432
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:06,874
Speaker 1: the original Xbox not the new one.

1433
01:28:06,894 --> 01:28:07,396
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

1434
01:28:07,857 --> 01:28:10,207
Speaker 0: It's huge It's it's weighs.

1435
01:28:10,307 --> 01:28:13,260
Speaker 0: I think what like twice as much as the original Xbox is a lot.

1436
01:28:13,883 --> 01:28:18,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, it probably is comparable to the weight of my computer You know.

1437
01:28:18,744 --> 01:28:23,839
Speaker 0: and this isn't just it's a lot of this is our opinion that you know, you might think that a giant ps3 is great.

1438
01:28:25,522 --> 01:28:35,020
Speaker 0: But the general internet hum Note, there isn't a lot of people short of super PlayStation fanboys who are saying good things about Sony.

1439
01:28:35,221 --> 01:28:37,086
Speaker 0: Everyone is saying bad things about Sony.

1440
01:28:37,366 --> 01:28:40,715
Speaker 0: there hasn't been positive news about Sony in years.

1441
01:28:41,036 --> 01:28:42,480
Speaker 0: You remember the root kits and everything.

1442
01:28:42,681 --> 01:28:50,240
Speaker 1: It's just yeah, don't forget Sony infected their computers with their users their customers with viruses because they think they're criminals.

1443
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,046
Speaker 0: Yeah So Sony is just.

1444
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:58,100
Speaker 0: everyone loves to bash Sony and they're keep bashing them lately and they're going to continue to bash them the late.

1445
01:28:58,501 --> 01:29:14,707
Speaker 0: the general feeling of the game media is that Sony is acting arrogantly and they're relying on their name recognition to just carry their dominance over into the next generation and not actually Realizing they need to be better than everyone else.

1446
01:29:14,807 --> 01:29:17,595
Speaker 0: because and we'll see how it turns out now

1447
01:29:17,635 --> 01:29:28,789
Speaker 1: compare that to the buzz about Microsoft Which after the Xbox 360 was announced and then it was released and then it sold out the buzz disappeared and no one really talked About it, but now that e3 has come around again.

1448
01:29:28,809 --> 01:29:32,040
Speaker 1: The buzz is back and it's neutral to positive.

1449
01:29:32,461 --> 01:29:34,729
Speaker 1: There's very little negative buzz about Microsoft.

1450
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:40,892
Speaker 0: Sony is really the only company that people love to bash Microsoft Especially Linux guys like us and we're not.

1451
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:42,399
Speaker 0: yeah, what does that tell you?

1452
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:46,046
Speaker 0: And of course the line to see the.

1453
01:29:46,086 --> 01:29:49,377
Speaker 0: we all can't deny this video of it.

1454
01:29:49,497 --> 01:29:50,300
Speaker 0: How can you deny?

1455
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, five minutes versus six hours.

1456
01:29:52,806 --> 01:29:59,125
Speaker 0: There's something and the clapping at the Nintendo conference versus the Sony you can't deny there it is Black and white.

1457
01:29:59,607 --> 01:30:05,570
Speaker 0: if you deny this then you might as well believe that you know Very heavily autistic kids can talk to you and type to you.

1458
01:30:05,711 --> 01:30:08,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not saying the ps3 is a bad platform.

1459
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:11,400
Speaker 1: We're saying Sony is a bad company and they're doing stupid things.

1460
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:19,231
Speaker 0: They're doing very stupid things and I predict they'll get their asses handed to them because the PSP is a cool piece And the press is saying very bad things about them.

1461
01:30:19,332 --> 01:30:25,355
Speaker 1: Yeah, the mainstream press I mean investment types are saying the ps3 is so overpriced.

1462
01:30:25,395 --> 01:30:26,358
Speaker 1: No one's gonna buy it.

1463
01:30:26,539 --> 01:30:29,368
Speaker 0: Yep Alright, let's start talking about Xbox games.

1464
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:30,372
Speaker 1: Alright shadowrun.

1465
01:30:30,392 --> 01:30:31,395
Speaker 1: I want to talk about shadowrun.

1466
01:30:31,636 --> 01:30:33,282
Speaker 0: Okay, talk about shadowrun Alright.

1467
01:30:33,543 --> 01:30:40,064
Speaker 1: there there were rumblings that I hadn't really heard until just now recently about Shadowrun game for the Xbox.

1468
01:30:40,084 --> 01:30:42,390
Speaker 0: Well, that was at their press conference.

1469
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:49,185
Speaker 0: Yeah before the press conference someone saw something on it In the being prepared show floor.

1470
01:30:49,206 --> 01:30:50,068
Speaker 0: that said shadowrun.

1471
01:30:50,148 --> 01:30:52,835
Speaker 1: Yep, and then it exploded on the internet as shadowrun.

1472
01:30:53,055 --> 01:30:53,797
Speaker 1: That's all I know.

1473
01:30:53,817 --> 01:31:01,482
Speaker 1: and Then we found out and now a lot of fans of shadowrun have been complaining saying that they ruined shadowrun Mm-hmm.

1474
01:31:02,184 --> 01:31:03,931
Speaker 1: I like shed a little bit of my own light on that.

1475
01:31:04,574 --> 01:31:11,540
Speaker 1: for anyone who has never played shadowrun It is a role-playing game system like Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms say or Dragon lance.

1476
01:31:11,621 --> 01:31:13,976
Speaker 1: It is a system coupled with a universe.

1477
01:31:14,278 --> 01:31:22,614
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm The universe has a history that has come out from the base books Plus the source books plus the novels and all that stuff like every gaming world has yep.

1478
01:31:23,918 --> 01:31:29,288
Speaker 1: It is incredibly Convoluted difficult to follow full of a million things.

1479
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:44,254
Speaker 1: It is cyberpunk futurism magic shamanism dragons Net hacking flying through cyberspace astral projections gods and shaman totems Politics everything everything everything everything all rolled into one, but it's mostly dark.

1480
01:31:44,575 --> 01:31:44,775
Speaker 1: Yes.

1481
01:31:44,836 --> 01:31:46,120
Speaker 1: It's very dark and dystopian.

1482
01:31:46,403 --> 01:31:50,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's while it's everything It's not light and happy anyway.

1483
01:31:50,661 --> 01:31:58,215
Speaker 1: Really now people are complaining that the game that's going to be coming out for the Xbox Which they didn't actually tell us that much about it other than that.

1484
01:31:58,436 --> 01:31:59,320
Speaker 1: It's going to exist.

1485
01:32:00,262 --> 01:32:06,219
Speaker 1: They're changing the plotline the history of the shadowrun world a bit to make the game work.

1486
01:32:08,301 --> 01:32:15,019
Speaker 1: The details are unimportant because if you know if you care about shadowrun you already know and if you don't care you already don't care.

1487
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:23,460
Speaker 1: But they're pushing some history events out and they're kind of changing the timeline and there's a giant uproar among the hardcore fans of shadowrun.

1488
01:32:24,502 --> 01:32:26,660
Speaker 0: Alright, well that's slightly different from what I was reading.

1489
01:32:27,181 --> 01:32:35,679
Speaker 0: What I was reading that people were upset that the game was not going to be in any way similar to the SNES game is Going to be a squad based combat game.

1490
01:32:36,262 --> 01:32:37,366
Speaker 1: Why would anyone complain about that?

1491
01:32:37,386 --> 01:32:40,477
Speaker 1: the SNES game was cool, but it was pretty terrible.

1492
01:32:40,618 --> 01:32:48,560
Speaker 0: all things considered People apparently wanted an RPG game and not a squad based combat game because apparently there is squad based combat games of the wazoo.

1493
01:32:49,165 --> 01:32:50,357
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true, too.

1494
01:32:51,421 --> 01:32:58,000
Speaker 0: People are saying at least the quotes that I saw in two places that this wasn't a slight changing of the shadowrun history.

1495
01:32:58,101 --> 01:33:03,272
Speaker 0: This was it's a fairly big change But it still are saying that they completely threw out everything shadowrun.

1496
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:06,442
Speaker 0: and the only thing this has in common with shadowrun is The name.

1497
01:33:06,683 --> 01:33:12,021
Speaker 0: and why did they buy the license just for the name to sell the game if they're not gonna actually use any other Stuff?

1498
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:13,828
Speaker 1: well the thing I don't think they threw everything out.

1499
01:33:13,908 --> 01:33:15,313
Speaker 1: It's that the type of game.

1500
01:33:15,354 --> 01:33:17,060
Speaker 1: It is doesn't really behoove.

1501
01:33:18,383 --> 01:33:21,219
Speaker 1: You don't care about a lot of the history of the game if you're making a game.

1502
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,065
Speaker 1: That's more simply based on the combat.

1503
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:24,530
Speaker 1: You don't care about?

1504
01:33:24,831 --> 01:33:27,580
Speaker 0: yeah, then why that people are saying why have the shadowrun?

1505
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:28,680
Speaker 0: I'm just saying what people are saying.

1506
01:33:28,702 --> 01:33:29,843
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I don't really care.

1507
01:33:29,964 --> 01:33:33,296
Speaker 0: one why have the shadowrun license for a game that doesn't need it?

1508
01:33:33,337 --> 01:33:35,566
Speaker 0: if you're not gonna use it You're just putting a name on that.

1509
01:33:35,606 --> 01:33:36,228
Speaker 0: try and sell it.

1510
01:33:36,309 --> 01:33:37,152
Speaker 1: I submit two things.

1511
01:33:37,513 --> 01:33:39,783
Speaker 1: one the name will sell To.

1512
01:33:39,924 --> 01:33:43,479
Speaker 1: the world that comes from has a lot of fodder from which to make a game.

1513
01:33:44,242 --> 01:33:46,769
Speaker 0: Yeah the thing that people are saying they're not using the fodder yet.

1514
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:48,334
Speaker 1: three by the license.

1515
01:33:48,474 --> 01:33:50,522
Speaker 1: once then you know by use it Again.

1516
01:33:50,563 --> 01:33:52,300
Speaker 1: make more games about shadowrun.

1517
01:33:52,741 --> 01:33:58,020
Speaker 1: Maybe this game is very generic to test the waters of what do people think of shadowrun type games?

1518
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:08,058
Speaker 0: But the thing is is that if you put it the label shadowrun on a game that Says you're trying to sell your you know a game is gonna sell to whatever people it's gonna sell to.

1519
01:34:08,118 --> 01:34:12,119
Speaker 0: normally Putting the shadowrun label on a game means you're going to.

1520
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:19,520
Speaker 0: You're paying money to get that label in order to sell it to all the people who would buy anything with the name shadow.

1521
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:22,834
Speaker 0: See now I don't think if you don't make a game that pleases those people.

1522
01:34:22,874 --> 01:34:24,140
Speaker 0: you're only going to piss them off.

1523
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,788
Speaker 1: But the thing is there aren't that many shadowrun people.

1524
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:30,540
Speaker 1: I love shadowrun, but I stopped only I didn't play it since high school.

1525
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,720
Speaker 0: That's not what the internet seems to be happening all these shadowrun things.

1526
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:36,965
Speaker 0: There are people coming out of the work everywhere commenting on this Oh, they are.

1527
01:34:37,025 --> 01:34:40,880
Speaker 0: but I mean if people didn't play shadowrun Oh, it would have been people play it.

1528
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,360
Speaker 0: You know if people didn't know what shadowrun was people would say what the fuck is out of run.

1529
01:34:44,503 --> 01:34:45,260
Speaker 0: Why do I hear that?

1530
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:45,882
Speaker 0: There's a shadow run.

1531
01:34:45,902 --> 01:34:50,663
Speaker 1: keep in mind that most of the people who came out really angrily are the heart are the dedicated fans of Shadowrun.

1532
01:34:51,246 --> 01:34:53,900
Speaker 1: people who aren't fans of shadowrun don't know much about it and don't care.

1533
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:54,524
Speaker 0: It seems that they're.

1534
01:34:54,705 --> 01:34:56,293
Speaker 0: yeah, but why put the label on?

1535
01:34:56,334 --> 01:35:00,954
Speaker 0: if you put the label on it You're not going to get people who aren't fans of shadowrun to buy it.

1536
01:35:01,255 --> 01:35:06,060
Speaker 0: putting the label on it means We are going to pay money to sell this game to hardcore fans of shadowrun.

1537
01:35:06,442 --> 01:35:09,300
Speaker 0: If you make it in such a way the hardcore fans of shadowrun won't like it.

1538
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:14,260
Speaker 0: They're not gonna buy it and you just spent money on a label you couldn't you could have avoided spending money on one.

1539
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:15,866
Speaker 1: They probably got the license pretty cheap.

1540
01:35:16,207 --> 01:35:19,298
Speaker 0: Well, I think Microsoft actually owns the FASA corporation.

1541
01:35:19,358 --> 01:35:23,108
Speaker 1: Yeah Shadowrun doesn't make much money.

1542
01:35:23,128 --> 01:35:26,180
Speaker 1: our pen and paper games in general are not doing well.

1543
01:35:26,561 --> 01:35:36,958
Speaker 1: Dungeons & Dragons is far and away still the champion and shadowrun Really died for a long time after for a while after second ed came out.

1544
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:44,039
Speaker 0: Yes It was vitalized for game died but apparently knowledge of the universe and interest in it is not dead.

1545
01:35:44,059 --> 01:35:45,639
Speaker 1: because Oh, it's not bad.

1546
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:53,128
Speaker 0: There are articles everywhere that said they're gonna make a shadowrun game and if people didn't know what shadowrun was or care about it They would have said what the hell shadowrun.

1547
01:35:53,188 --> 01:35:53,810
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I didn't.

1548
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:55,316
Speaker 0: there's thousands of people going.

1549
01:35:55,336 --> 01:35:56,300
Speaker 0: Oh my god shadowrun.

1550
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,713
Speaker 1: Whoo, what I'm saying is that a lot of people are.

1551
01:35:58,773 --> 01:36:00,039
Speaker 1: I think a lot of these people are like me.

1552
01:36:00,682 --> 01:36:05,620
Speaker 1: I played shadowrun a long time ago and I loved it and then it kind of died and I couldn't play it.

1553
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:12,067
Speaker 1: But I still know about it and I like it and I've always wanted something to come back with it And now something's coming back with it.

1554
01:36:12,348 --> 01:36:15,459
Speaker 1: The name rekindles these things even though people don't play it so much now.

1555
01:36:16,961 --> 01:36:18,831
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the people who know the name.

1556
01:36:19,353 --> 01:36:21,844
Speaker 0: if they care about that name They know something about it.

1557
01:36:22,105 --> 01:36:27,064
Speaker 0: and being nerdy as only someone who knows about shadowrun is going to be nerdy They don't like it.

1558
01:36:27,104 --> 01:36:33,713
Speaker 0: when you mess with what it was if I release a game and I put the Star Wars name on it And it doesn't have lightsabers and x-wings and TIE fighters.

1559
01:36:33,894 --> 01:36:35,080
Speaker 1: You mean like Star Wars galaxies.

1560
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:38,169
Speaker 0: People aren't gonna like that game Star Wars galaxies.

1561
01:36:38,189 --> 01:36:40,477
Speaker 1: They're gonna yell at me, which was just people dancing in the desert.

1562
01:36:40,838 --> 01:36:41,280
Speaker 0: exactly.

1563
01:36:41,644 --> 01:36:47,276
Speaker 1: See, I guess I'm a shadowrun fan But I don't really care much for the timeline because it's mostly kind of silly and convoluted.

1564
01:36:47,296 --> 01:36:55,560
Speaker 0: not saying it's not silly I'm just saying this is akin to someone buying the Star Wars label putting it on a game and then Taking out all the Star Wars stuff.

1565
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:57,527
Speaker 0: it's like no one's gonna anyone.

1566
01:36:57,607 --> 01:37:08,296
Speaker 0: you're putting the Star Wars label means you're gonna try to sell it to Star Wars fans and If you don't have Star Wars stuff They're purposefully not going to buy it because of the type of people fans are I just.

1567
01:37:08,336 --> 01:37:15,999
Speaker 1: I think the game's gonna do fine And I'll bet this is only gonna be the first of a string of shadowrun games And I'll bet at least one of them will be an RPG at some point.

1568
01:37:16,642 --> 01:37:26,180
Speaker 0: Well judging by the you know internet talk about it It's a it's a mixed bag, we'll see until people actually get their hands on the game.

1569
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:28,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just have this feeling.

1570
01:37:28,306 --> 01:37:31,614
Speaker 1: this is a complete gut hunch that the game will do.

1571
01:37:31,655 --> 01:37:31,835
Speaker 1: Well.

1572
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:34,384
Speaker 1: This is a hunch like mr What's it from?

1573
01:37:34,444 --> 01:37:36,093
Speaker 1: Scotland Yard is hiding in the subway?

1574
01:37:36,435 --> 01:37:36,737
Speaker 0: Yeah?

1575
01:37:36,898 --> 01:37:41,614
Speaker 0: We'll see Halo 3 man.

1576
01:37:42,198 --> 01:37:46,570
Speaker 0: yeah If you do the halo rant we always do.

1577
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:48,096
Speaker 0: or should we just sum it up really quickly?

1578
01:37:48,116 --> 01:37:53,477
Speaker 1: uh Real quick Halo is not innovative or new or good.

1579
01:37:54,462 --> 01:37:55,405
Speaker 1: It is doing things.

1580
01:37:55,506 --> 01:37:55,827
Speaker 1: now.

1581
01:37:56,148 --> 01:37:59,039
Speaker 1: that PCs did with FPS is almost a decade ago.

1582
01:37:59,561 --> 01:38:06,180
Speaker 0: Basically what happened in the history of FPS is is people grew up playing FPS and they played quake and everything.

1583
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,599
Speaker 0: They were real FPS players.

1584
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:18,499
Speaker 0: Then there was Goldeneye, which is the console FPS which is not much compared to the PC FPS But because it was on a console and as for player it didn't need to have everything the PC FPS has had.

1585
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:20,387
Speaker 1: yep I mean compared to a PC game.

1586
01:38:20,407 --> 01:38:22,618
Speaker 1: It was piss-poor, but for a console FPS.

1587
01:38:22,658 --> 01:38:25,812
Speaker 0: It was great Yeah, and it's still one of the greatest console FPS is.

1588
01:38:26,414 --> 01:38:34,425
Speaker 0: so what happened was is You eventually got to counter-strike and the whole thing stagnated and kind of you know Stayed still for a long time.

1589
01:38:34,465 --> 01:38:36,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, it didn't die by far.

1590
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:38,820
Speaker 1: counter-strike is still played by a lot of freaking people.

1591
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:49,356
Speaker 0: It's one of the biggest games yep, but when halo came out It was like the resurgence of FPSing because there was finally an FPS that was accessible to a lot of people.

1592
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:54,351
Speaker 0: the thing is People who played real FPS is like counter-strike and shit was like.

1593
01:38:54,993 --> 01:39:03,560
Speaker 0: most of them were like halo is crap, and I found this out Because most of the people I knew who played halo were either younger or people who weren't big into real FPS.

1594
01:39:04,384 --> 01:39:11,860
Speaker 0: And my brother who is the halo age yet He played counter-strike because he was my brother was like yeah, halo sucks.

1595
01:39:12,941 --> 01:39:18,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I remember playing halo, and it was just really really generic and kind of dumb.

1596
01:39:18,901 --> 01:39:21,230
Speaker 0: I mean tribes 2 is better than halo by a hajillion.

1597
01:39:21,551 --> 01:39:24,160
Speaker 1: tribes 2 is probably in my opinion the best FPS.

1598
01:39:24,381 --> 01:39:26,555
Speaker 0: I played the halo 1 PC demo.

1599
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:35,712
Speaker 0: I remember and Even with the mouse and keyboard it was just this really easy walk around shoot guys game And it was kind of blah, and I know the multiplayer.

1600
01:39:35,752 --> 01:39:37,700
Speaker 0: you can have a lot of fun with vehicles and stuff.

1601
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:39,686
Speaker 0: But unreal tournament, I like.

1602
01:39:39,866 --> 01:39:49,680
Speaker 0: I played unreal tournament 2007 demo and that was a lot more fun than halo multiplayer But still to halos credit it brought a lot of new people into the FPS genre.

1603
01:39:50,061 --> 01:39:57,780
Speaker 0: It's basically the easy FPS for wussies and real FPS players play something else and all the halo noobs play halo.

1604
01:39:58,281 --> 01:40:03,980
Speaker 1: Well the thing is people haven't really moved on in the FPS world and PCs because the best games are still counter-strike.

1605
01:40:04,842 --> 01:40:05,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're standing still.

1606
01:40:06,627 --> 01:40:11,080
Speaker 0: so it's like there's two tiers of FPS playing and halo is the lower tier.

1607
01:40:11,181 --> 01:40:12,799
Speaker 0: It's like the entry-level FPS.

1608
01:40:13,981 --> 01:40:20,420
Speaker 1: Now I wonder I mean it's hard to make a PC like FPS on a console mostly because you don't have a keyboard and mouse.

1609
01:40:21,263 --> 01:40:24,880
Speaker 1: You don't have the ability to change the game as easily over time with updates.

1610
01:40:25,121 --> 01:40:36,680
Speaker 0: You can't have really complex controls because there are only so many buttons, so you can't give people Jetpacks and a billion weapons and a bunch of sidearm grenades and all kinds of crazy stuff.

1611
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:39,011
Speaker 1: Yeah, if anyone out there thinks halo is complex.

1612
01:40:39,493 --> 01:40:51,880
Speaker 1: I dare you I double dog dare you to play weapons factory or Mega-tf without a whole bunch of crazy scripts to run your freaking character for you while you're running around.

1613
01:40:52,201 --> 01:40:52,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had.

1614
01:40:52,885 --> 01:40:59,792
Speaker 1: you would have like 20 keys bound to 20 esoteric weird Tribes - is complex enough tribes - had its own scripting language.

1615
01:41:00,193 --> 01:41:00,413
Speaker 0: Well.

1616
01:41:00,815 --> 01:41:09,140
Speaker 0: It was just the engine has a scripting language That's pretty much C++ because the way it's written Yeah, which was great compared to frickin half or not the half-life wasn't so bad.

1617
01:41:09,441 --> 01:41:18,907
Speaker 1: But quake - where you had to write in this stupid obtuse barely work scripting language that was laggy and buggy and crap Mm-hmm, but you needed to do it to play these games.

1618
01:41:18,927 --> 01:41:21,514
Speaker 1: There was no complex all right now.

1619
01:41:21,554 --> 01:41:22,777
Speaker 0: There was something mentioned.

1620
01:41:22,797 --> 01:41:25,985
Speaker 0: I think Great Grand Theft Auto.

1621
01:41:26,005 --> 01:41:32,144
Speaker 0: for now what happened was I'm sure everyone has seen on the internet the Xbox guy.

1622
01:41:32,365 --> 01:41:33,611
Speaker 0: what he did is he was like.

1623
01:41:33,912 --> 01:41:35,700
Speaker 0: you know he said something a lot.

1624
01:41:35,861 --> 01:41:44,283
Speaker 0: He was trying to make a joke and he said like girly man You have rubber duckies referring to Sony using a rubber duck and all their demos And he's like real.

1625
01:41:44,324 --> 01:41:51,840
Speaker 0: men get tattoos, and he shows he had a tattoo for Halo 2 and on his other arm He had a tattoo for Grand Theft Auto 4.

1626
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,599
Speaker 0: I think someone else is doing a job of finding out what the tattoos are real or not.

1627
01:41:56,263 --> 01:41:58,897
Speaker 1: I saw on a report someone said that they are real.

1628
01:41:59,139 --> 01:42:00,727
Speaker 1: Wow But the report was.

1629
01:42:00,768 --> 01:42:02,718
Speaker 1: someone asked him if they were real and he said yes.

1630
01:42:03,524 --> 01:42:05,679
Speaker 1: Which may or may not be true tattoo?

1631
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,949
Speaker 0: Professionals say the Grand Theft Auto one was a lot.

1632
01:42:08,989 --> 01:42:12,480
Speaker 0: the white color used in it was a lot brighter than any tattoo can be.

1633
01:42:12,961 --> 01:42:18,420
Speaker 0: So they speculated as to whether it was painted over to be brighter, or if it just wasn't real at all.

1634
01:42:19,224 --> 01:42:20,389
Speaker 0: Well it remains to be seen.

1635
01:42:20,469 --> 01:42:22,680
Speaker 1: we'll find out a year from now if you still got it now.

1636
01:42:23,201 --> 01:42:27,135
Speaker 0: Grand Theft Auto 4 they said sometime around the end in 2007. so it's a ways off.

1637
01:42:29,002 --> 01:42:41,566
Speaker 0: But what we know about it is we don't think it's gonna be exclusive to the Xbox 360. however It's going to come out for the Xbox 360 Before it comes out for anything else.

1638
01:42:41,707 --> 01:42:52,472
Speaker 0: it might come out for the PlayStation 3 and the PC on the same day as it comes Out for the 360, but it's guaranteed that when it comes out the day it comes out It'll be available on the 360 for sure.

1639
01:42:52,492 --> 01:42:57,744
Speaker 1: yeah This seems to be a new trend in exclusivity because you can't really Exclusive.

1640
01:42:57,764 --> 01:43:00,880
Speaker 1: games aren't really good for the people who make the games.

1641
01:43:01,101 --> 01:43:08,370
Speaker 0: They're good for the people who have the consoles so they have to usually pay you know the Developer to make the game exclusive to you.

1642
01:43:08,451 --> 01:43:21,699
Speaker 0: now what Microsoft is doing is They sort of made a compromise it seems with Rockstar because Rockstar doesn't want their game to be exclusive to the Xbox 360. unless the PlayStation 3 bombs then they don't care yeah, because that means less sales for them.

1643
01:43:22,341 --> 01:43:34,605
Speaker 0: So what it seems they've done is they made a deal with Rockstar where if you play on the 360 you're going to get some exclusive levels and things extra Through Xbox Live.

1644
01:43:34,646 --> 01:43:34,987
Speaker 0: of course.

1645
01:43:35,268 --> 01:43:40,908
Speaker 1: now as much as I don't always like that sort of thing It's definitely better than locking into one console.

1646
01:43:41,148 --> 01:43:45,441
Speaker 0: Yes better for gamers is better for gamers who want to play Grand Theft Auto 4.

1647
01:43:45,441 --> 01:43:46,211
Speaker 0: I don't want to play it.

1648
01:43:46,515 --> 01:43:50,051
Speaker 0: however What it's gonna Do is it's gonna do a Soul Calibur 2 effect.

1649
01:43:50,453 --> 01:43:54,859
Speaker 0: Soul Calibur 2 was in every system But the GameCube was the system to play it on because it had link.

1650
01:43:55,544 --> 01:44:01,696
Speaker 0: Grand Theft Auto 4 will be on all the you know the systems But the Xbox will be the system to play it on because it has these downloads.

1651
01:44:01,757 --> 01:44:07,980
Speaker 1: yep now I wouldn't be surprised long term if they made some sort of special Grand Theft for the Wii with the Wii controller.

1652
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:08,765
Speaker 1: They could do something.

1653
01:44:08,986 --> 01:44:09,691
Speaker 0: they could drive eyes.

1654
01:44:09,711 --> 01:44:10,033
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1655
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:16,220
Speaker 0: Rockstar seems to be the kind of company that won't do it unless a lot of people buy Wiis.

1656
01:44:16,641 --> 01:44:22,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, which I think a lot of people will yeah, but the other thing is the people who buy Wiis aren't gonna.

1657
01:44:22,661 --> 01:44:26,191
Speaker 0: You know Nintendo's like yeah, you hardcore people aren't gonna buy Wiis.

1658
01:44:26,291 --> 01:44:29,380
Speaker 0: grandmas and kids and everyone else and girls are gonna buy Wiis.

1659
01:44:30,124 --> 01:44:32,820
Speaker 1: So it's more me hoping than me expecting.

1660
01:44:33,021 --> 01:44:36,880
Speaker 0: Yep, so those people aren't the types to buy Grand Theft Auto, but Rockstar smart.

1661
01:44:36,981 --> 01:44:39,040
Speaker 1: I mean they make games that make them a lot of money.

1662
01:44:39,181 --> 01:44:43,167
Speaker 1: So if there's a market for that sort of thing you can bet they'll do it alright.

1663
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:49,013
Speaker 0: Microsoft really seems to be expanding the Xbox Live arcade deal.

1664
01:44:49,134 --> 01:44:51,240
Speaker 0: There was something about Lou mines live.

1665
01:44:51,882 --> 01:45:00,449
Speaker 0: I guess you'd play Lou mines on your Xbox and your cell phone and whatever and it'd be some sort of like Something with the webcam.

1666
01:45:00,609 --> 01:45:04,603
Speaker 0: I don't know what I talked about it that much because no one cares about DDR universe.

1667
01:45:04,843 --> 01:45:07,351
Speaker 0: so apparently Xbox is the system for DDR.

1668
01:45:07,873 --> 01:45:10,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can see us downloading new songs.

1669
01:45:10,841 --> 01:45:12,148
Speaker 0: Hopefully they won't charge for them.

1670
01:45:12,168 --> 01:45:12,832
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

1671
01:45:12,872 --> 01:45:13,254
Speaker 0: They will.

1672
01:45:13,335 --> 01:45:13,938
Speaker 1: I guarantee it.

1673
01:45:15,182 --> 01:45:17,340
Speaker 1: I'd freaking guarantee they're gonna charge money for the songs.

1674
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:19,308
Speaker 1: They'll have to because the songs are copyrighted.

1675
01:45:19,348 --> 01:45:22,180
Speaker 0: can see that sounds more like Sony's bag charging for the songs.

1676
01:45:22,363 --> 01:45:27,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, the our game But there I don't see any way around it because the people who own the music are probably going to be pricks about it.

1677
01:45:28,242 --> 01:45:31,246
Speaker 0: Well, we'll see Viva pinata.

1678
01:45:31,689 --> 01:45:31,950
Speaker 0: now.

1679
01:45:32,513 --> 01:45:39,228
Speaker 0: when they showed this game People kind of went grumbly grumbly and then the ex the guy on stage was like, come on.

1680
01:45:39,268 --> 01:45:51,166
Speaker 0: It's an e-rated game and The crowd's reaction was like yeah, whatever It's from what people say it looks like an Animal Crossing type of game, which is like, alright You're trying to copy Animal Crossing whatever.

1681
01:45:51,828 --> 01:46:00,032
Speaker 0: but all the guy the press people seem to be saying I We weren't not cheering because it was an e-rated game.

1682
01:46:00,073 --> 01:46:02,160
Speaker 0: We weren't cheering because it didn't look that interesting.

1683
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:07,160
Speaker 0: It's look like ghetto, you know, it's hard to tell Animal Crossing the little pin.

1684
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:13,680
Speaker 1: Yeah It's hard to tell what they're trying to do with this game other than maybe Steal some of the people who want Animal Crossing over to the Xbox.

1685
01:46:14,462 --> 01:46:31,580
Speaker 0: yeah, maybe what's gonna happen is people buy an Xbox and instead of you know going out and Spending a bunch of money on a Wii for their kids They'll just buy Viva pinata for their already Existing 360 and then spend the rest of the money they would have spent on a Wii on more 360 stuff for themselves.

1686
01:46:32,161 --> 01:46:34,899
Speaker 1: Of course for the price of a ps3 you can just buy an Xbox and a Wii.

1687
01:46:35,363 --> 01:46:37,099
Speaker 0: But well, no, we don't know how much the Wii cost yet.

1688
01:46:37,422 --> 01:46:40,239
Speaker 1: I pretty much guarantee you'll be able to buy them both for the price of a ps3.

1689
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:43,188
Speaker 0: Yep, people seem to be guaranteeing that it'll probably be true.

1690
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:49,640
Speaker 1: In fact Microsoft themselves have come out and basically said yeah Sony socks, you should buy a Wii.

1691
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:57,719
Speaker 0: Remember how before I was saying Sony it does the same thing as a Wii only crappier and does the same thing as a 360 only crappier.

1692
01:46:58,261 --> 01:47:04,860
Speaker 0: That would work out if the ps3 cost less than both of the systems combined because then it's like I can get both for less.

1693
01:47:05,382 --> 01:47:16,319
Speaker 0: but this is why get something that does two things and Each thing it does is shittier when I can get both of those things to the max separately for the same price or even less

1694
01:47:18,202 --> 01:47:21,600
Speaker 1: And this is Microsoft talking because they don't care if Nintendo is successful or not.

1695
01:47:21,941 --> 01:47:31,820
Speaker 0: it's like cell phone cameras work because it's cheaper than the price of a cell phone and a camera and Combining them is good because you have your cell phone everywhere with you.

1696
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:35,499
Speaker 0: So now you have a camera everywhere with you and the camera is all of a sudden becomes more useful.

1697
01:47:36,601 --> 01:47:40,593
Speaker 0: Having a Wii combined with an Xbox Live is sort of useful.

1698
01:47:40,654 --> 01:47:49,160
Speaker 0: the same way having a camera on your phone is useful but If for the same price as a camera phone you can get a camera and a phone then the camera phone doesn't work.

1699
01:47:49,822 --> 01:47:55,540
Speaker 1: Yep, of course Nintendo wins all around because people could own a ps3 and a Wii or an Xbox and a Wii.

1700
01:47:56,203 --> 01:47:58,920
Speaker 1: Not many people are going to own Xbox and a ps3.

1701
01:47:59,901 --> 01:48:02,549
Speaker 1: Not many now because the games are gonna mostly overlap.

1702
01:48:02,589 --> 01:48:06,903
Speaker 1: aside from the exclusives every third-party game is gonna come out on both systems Mm-hmm.

1703
01:48:07,365 --> 01:48:13,860
Speaker 1: In fact that could actually be a really bad point for Sony because yeah The PlayStation 3 has better graphics capabilities, right?

1704
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:23,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if a third party makes a game for the Xbox and the ps3 They're gonna make damn well sure it runs on the Xbox and I don't know how much extra effort they're gonna put into making it Look better.

1705
01:48:23,644 --> 01:48:31,280
Speaker 0: They usually they make it look better If you look at history of all the millions of games that are released on the ps2 and the Xbox.

1706
01:48:31,701 --> 01:48:37,540
Speaker 0: People always well almost always put in the extra effort to make it look better on the more powerful system.

1707
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:38,947
Speaker 0: However, ever they don't.

1708
01:48:39,007 --> 01:48:41,340
Speaker 1: then the X the extra effort was easier.

1709
01:48:41,801 --> 01:48:45,773
Speaker 1: It's of everyone's keep saying it's hellishly hard to do anything with the ps3.

1710
01:48:46,013 --> 01:48:48,059
Speaker 0: development wise I still think you know.

1711
01:48:48,922 --> 01:48:55,160
Speaker 0: What happens is if you don't make your game look you've released a game for a bunch of systems and it doesn't look better.

1712
01:48:55,300 --> 01:49:00,200
Speaker 0: On the more powerful system all the press yells at you and gives you a worse review.

1713
01:49:00,741 --> 01:49:04,694
Speaker 0: Game developers will put in as much extra effort as they feel necessary.

1714
01:49:04,895 --> 01:49:09,071
Speaker 1: Well, they have always done Yeah, but we'll see how much extra effort they will do it.

1715
01:49:09,091 --> 01:49:10,036
Speaker 1: three scales.

1716
01:49:10,116 --> 01:49:13,307
Speaker 1: There are a lot of Levels of effort you can put in.

1717
01:49:13,588 --> 01:49:16,480
Speaker 0: they will do it until it becomes, you know cost prohibitive.

1718
01:49:19,624 --> 01:49:21,860
Speaker 0: Rest of the Xbox 360 games were kind of normal.

1719
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:28,555
Speaker 0: You know the sports games a lot of peace a lot of games that would have been PC games But are now gonna be PC slash 360 games.

1720
01:49:29,305 --> 01:49:31,386
Speaker 0: Yeah What the 360 is all about.

1721
01:49:32,209 --> 01:49:35,520
Speaker 1: a lot of people also pointed out that the buzz at e3 is that people were saying?

1722
01:49:35,962 --> 01:49:39,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ps3 is more powerful, but the Xbox games looked better?

1723
01:49:39,962 --> 01:49:41,368
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's interesting.

1724
01:49:41,388 --> 01:49:45,565
Speaker 0: The thing is is that you didn't see a lot of Ps3 game.

1725
01:49:45,585 --> 01:49:47,939
Speaker 1: we saw a lot of FMV saw a lot of FMV.

1726
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:51,008
Speaker 0: You saw a lot of FMVs and bullshots for the 360 also.

1727
01:49:51,028 --> 01:50:02,395
Speaker 0: Yep, but there was gameplay footage that was seen and The opinion of most people is that right now a lot of the ps3 footage doesn't look that much better than 360 at games themselves.

1728
01:50:04,922 --> 01:50:06,006
Speaker 1: I really think we're just there's.

1729
01:50:06,287 --> 01:50:07,491
Speaker 1: they're diminishing returns.

1730
01:50:07,551 --> 01:50:14,420
Speaker 0: and if you're someone like us who doesn't care about graphics What matters is all the other stuff where Microsoft has a distinct advantage.

1731
01:50:15,241 --> 01:50:17,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, we don't even have HDTV.

1732
01:50:17,689 --> 01:50:19,013
Speaker 1: So for us we don't care at all.

1733
01:50:19,334 --> 01:50:20,980
Speaker 0: No, I could care less of it at HD.

1734
01:50:21,301 --> 01:50:25,373
Speaker 0: So, you know the fact that the ps3 is 1080 whatever and the 360 is 720 doesn't mean anything to me.

1735
01:50:27,801 --> 01:50:36,457
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be doing 480i All right, all the rest of the games are sequels franchises licenses usual type of games you see.

1736
01:50:36,477 --> 01:50:43,940
Speaker 1: yeah The only last thing we really would have talked about but I don't have much to say about it Even though some people have asked is will write spore?

1737
01:50:44,562 --> 01:50:46,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is what I know about.

1738
01:50:46,468 --> 01:50:50,160
Speaker 0: will write spore because I don't pay attention to PC games so much because I'm Linux guy.

1739
01:50:51,001 --> 01:50:52,106
Speaker 0: It's gonna be PC game.

1740
01:50:52,126 --> 01:50:54,878
Speaker 0: If you don't know will write is the sims sim city?

1741
01:50:54,938 --> 01:50:56,405
Speaker 0: cool guy He makes good games.

1742
01:50:56,585 --> 01:50:59,520
Speaker 1: you make a little creature and then you like breed it and evolve it.

1743
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:15,260
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like you start out with like a bacteria or protozoa and you can make decisions and modify and over time you know it evolves and grows and Eventually you get a society and you can see the effects carry through all the way to the end of the game.

1744
01:51:15,361 --> 01:51:27,760
Speaker 0: so if you give your protozoa like Three little feelers now your people when they when they evolve into an advanced life form now that advanced Life form was three arms Yeah, and yeah

1745
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:30,387
Speaker 1: Madam and you have to deal with don't have

1746
01:51:30,407 --> 01:51:36,246
Speaker 0: to develop your whole society now around the fact that your guys have three arms And etcetera etcetera etcetera

1747
01:51:36,447 --> 01:51:39,739
Speaker 1: that we don't really yet even know too much about the game.

1748
01:51:40,381 --> 01:51:41,365
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a lot.

1749
01:51:41,385 --> 01:51:44,417
Speaker 0: I could have read some more articles about it, but I did.

1750
01:51:44,477 --> 01:51:45,220
Speaker 0: I do the show.

1751
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:52,250
Speaker 1: I read the article where they had some people who were at his little presentation thing and I didn't really gain much from it.

1752
01:51:52,451 --> 01:51:56,680
Speaker 0: They didn't really the games not ready yet It sounds like it might be a fun game.

1753
01:51:56,941 --> 01:52:00,940
Speaker 1: They people basically see me and they'd say it's a sandbox game.

1754
01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:05,054
Speaker 1: That is also kind of a like Sim Earth Sim galaxy.

1755
01:52:05,616 --> 01:52:06,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, hopefully not a Sim Ant.

1756
01:52:07,605 --> 01:52:14,360
Speaker 1: Sim Ant was awesome and by awesome I mean it was awesome for five minutes, and then you'd already done everything you could ever do in the game.

1757
01:52:15,622 --> 01:52:23,520
Speaker 0: Here's hoping that Spore is fun, and here's hoping that it's not just a Windows game that I'll never play.

1758
01:52:24,623 --> 01:52:31,035
Speaker 1: I think we'll have to wait until there's more info about it Or maybe until we get it and play it before we can say much.

1759
01:52:31,658 --> 01:52:37,660
Speaker 0: Yeah Maybe I'll try to read some more stuff about it, and we'll do a quick preview on a future Tuesday.

1760
01:52:39,301 --> 01:52:41,492
Speaker 1: But for that Scott's a hacking up a storm here.

1761
01:52:41,532 --> 01:52:44,722
Speaker 1: I think he's getting sick or something but oh That's good.

1762
01:52:44,762 --> 01:52:45,807
Speaker 0: Everyone's gonna love to hear that.

1763
01:52:45,867 --> 01:52:48,840
Speaker 0: cuz I haven't been sick in how long a little while.

1764
01:52:49,422 --> 01:52:51,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I don't get sick very often.

1765
01:52:51,895 --> 01:52:52,779
Speaker 0: It's a rare event.

1766
01:52:53,523 --> 01:52:57,518
Speaker 0: No, no podcasting will be lost over this unless I am hospital ill.

1767
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:58,604
Speaker 1: yeah But he's over there.

1768
01:52:58,644 --> 01:53:00,594
Speaker 1: hacking and coughing is making it kind of annoying.

1769
01:53:00,634 --> 01:53:01,720
Speaker 1: so I think we'll just stop here.

1770
01:53:02,001 --> 01:53:10,560
Speaker 0: I think we covered all the e3 stuff anyway you remember you can Figure out all the other stuff that happened at e3 by going to all the gaming websites.

1771
01:53:11,103 --> 01:53:12,935
Speaker 0: IGN and whatnot has all the info.

1772
01:53:12,975 --> 01:53:16,168
Speaker 0: game spot E3 buzz comm is really good.

1773
01:53:16,188 --> 01:53:18,537
Speaker 0: I've been using that a lot for the past week or so.

1774
01:53:18,557 --> 01:53:19,240
Speaker 0: yep though.

1775
01:53:19,321 --> 01:53:25,615
Speaker 1: So if if you haven't been following it It's kind of intimidating to go there from scratch because now you don't know anything.

1776
01:53:25,635 --> 01:53:27,908
Speaker 1: if I go there now It's like oh, there's a new thing.

1777
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:28,876
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a new thing.

1778
01:53:29,178 --> 01:53:35,101
Speaker 0: yeah But if you haven't been going there all along you just see the newest thing and it's hard to realize what all the old things Are.

1779
01:53:35,262 --> 01:53:37,472
Speaker 0: yeah, there are a lot of summaries.

1780
01:53:37,532 --> 01:53:41,004
Speaker 0: if you go to Kotaku and gadget Kotaku's joy stick.

1781
01:53:41,024 --> 01:53:44,378
Speaker 1: in my opinion Kotaku and joystick have a lot of just like oh here was a cool thing.

1782
01:53:44,418 --> 01:53:44,880
Speaker 1: Here's a video.

1783
01:53:44,941 --> 01:53:45,467
Speaker 1: Here's a video.

1784
01:53:45,507 --> 01:53:49,248
Speaker 0: I have to say that Kotaku has the most humorous coverage.

1785
01:53:49,268 --> 01:53:58,098
Speaker 0: they have things like a video of the food and a video of the line Joystick and engage you I think have the best real serious coverage so far.

1786
01:53:59,022 --> 01:54:02,314
Speaker 0: So check them out if you actually care about things and not don't just want to laugh.

01:54:02,936 --> 01:54:04,841
