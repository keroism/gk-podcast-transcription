1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,537
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday February 27th.

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,142
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:15,529
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:20,089
Speaker 0: tonight We review an old classic Super Mario world.

5
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:24,014
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:44,659
Speaker 0: You know sometimes when I do my job I start to think about how weird is the world where I get paid more money than most humans on this planet to Get up drive to a building somewhere Unplug one cable plug in another cable and then stand there to make sure that new cable is working.

7
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,737
Speaker 1: and You had to go through how many years of training to reach.

8
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:54,840
Speaker 0: oh yes Learning how to unplug this cable consume much of my college life.

9
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,714
Speaker 1: Could you have done it say I don't know six years ago.

10
00:00:57,774 --> 00:00:58,880
Speaker 1: Could you have accomplished this feat?

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,459
Speaker 0: I could have accomplished this feat when I was nine.

12
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:07,336
Speaker 1: How come nine-year-olds aren't paid the amount of money you are paid to do the same thing.

13
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:08,220
Speaker 0: I don't know.

14
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:11,539
Speaker 1: I mean you could pay a nine-year-old with candy to do the same thing.

15
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,042
Speaker 0: Well, I guess part of it is that I mean it Realistically.

16
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:18,160
Speaker 0: the only reason it was easy is because nothing went wrong.

17
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:23,370
Speaker 0: But if that optical circuit had in fact not come back up I would have had a world of trouble to deal with that.

18
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:31,380
Speaker 1: the nine-year-old would probably have just cried Yeah, I'm going to work the day after tomorrow.

19
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:33,639
Speaker 0: Oh, man's new job.

20
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:39,050
Speaker 0: Are you gonna fall into that rut of Work really really really hard to try to impress everyone for a month before?

21
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:51,196
Speaker 0: the decay of the reality that this job is not temporary eats at your soul and eventually you slip into that show up late leave early don't do half the work you're supposed to because it Doesn't matter it all depends on how this work goes.

22
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:57,279
Speaker 1: There is a chance I'll be it a less than 50% chance that this work is actually a good work.

23
00:01:58,087 --> 00:02:08,465
Speaker 1: And if it's a good work Then everything's cool, or it could be just like every other work in which case yes, I'll do exactly what you just said Right?

24
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:15,317
Speaker 0: so in the news you know it's gaming day I was gonna talk about how Sony has now said that rumble.

25
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:16,240
Speaker 0: who needs rumble?

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,309
Speaker 0: That's a last-generation feature anyway, but I'm not gonna.

27
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,817
Speaker 0: That's not my news cuz what can I say?

28
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:22,880
Speaker 0: Sony is just done?

29
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,660
Speaker 0: Alrighty, so I'm gonna go way off topic here cuz a lot of people on the internet have lost their shit over this.

30
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:38,004
Speaker 0: Coca-cola for those of you who are unaware is one of the most popular brands of carbonated sugar water in the world It's true.

31
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:42,620
Speaker 0: It's perhaps the number one and coca-cola is doing something crazy.

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,751
Speaker 0: They're changing the design of their cans.

33
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:48,636
Speaker 1: What are they making it blue or white?

34
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:51,059
Speaker 0: no no no actually It's a really subtle change.

35
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,500
Speaker 0: They're making them kind of this matte instead of the glossy shiny that they are currently.

36
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:58,759
Speaker 0: They look a lot more like old old old cans of coke.

37
00:02:59,241 --> 00:02:59,906
Speaker 1: I like that cuz.

38
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:02,160
Speaker 1: I like the way the old cans look better than the new ones.

39
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:02,784
Speaker 0: I had to admit.

40
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:03,871
Speaker 0: I was well one.

41
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:05,080
Speaker 0: I don't care about this at all.

42
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:06,690
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't make a difference in my life.

43
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:12,380
Speaker 1: I mean I don't even drink soda I don't drink anything that fizzes, and I don't drink any sodas.

44
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:14,411
Speaker 0: Why don't you drink anything that fizzes?

45
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:15,598
Speaker 1: cuz I don't like fizz.

46
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:19,560
Speaker 0: now I'm just curious here in the sake of knowledge and such.

47
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:21,748
Speaker 0: What is it about fizz that you don't like?

48
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,200
Speaker 1: it feels unpleasant in my mouth now unpleasant?

49
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,163
Speaker 0: How is it in?

50
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:27,849
Speaker 0: somehow painful?

51
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:28,852
Speaker 1: or it is the?

52
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:30,980
Speaker 1: it is not a pleasant tingling?

53
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,108
Speaker 1: It is slightly more pain.

54
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:39,780
Speaker 1: It is not painful as an ow like if I cut my finger But it is more pain than is pleasant.

55
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:46,400
Speaker 1: Uh-huh like a scratching only tingly, but tingly more so than necessary.

56
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:49,380
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm not sure what I could say about this.

57
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:56,460
Speaker 0: I'm just I'm amused at how seriously people around the world are taking this like it's actually somehow a big deal.

58
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:58,097
Speaker 0: Yet I remember when dr.

59
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,800
Speaker 0: Pepper changed their 20-ounce thing to be this kind of cone-shaped business and no one even batted an eye.

60
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:07,220
Speaker 0: And people keep changing the designs of cans and bottles and no one cares.

61
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:16,060
Speaker 0: Suddenly cokes touching on that you know deep-rooted American coca-cola and mom's apple pie and baseball and suddenly everyone loses their shit.

62
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,125
Speaker 1: It's only cuz someone said something.

63
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:30,366
Speaker 1: if no one said anything if they just changed it without saying anything No one would have noticed or cared except for maybe a few of those nutty people who collect you know coca-cola Memorabilia or something like that.

64
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:41,140
Speaker 0: you know I knew one of those people in high school who had some crystal Pepsi Wow a quite a bit of it in fact scary all sealed and he actually they do really really likes crystal Pepsi.

65
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,083
Speaker 0: It's a serious problem.

66
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:48,460
Speaker 0: It's like those people who have you know the wine cellar full of 20 bottles of hundred-year-old wine.

67
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:51,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like you can ever make more of that.

68
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,900
Speaker 0: if you really like that and you drink the last bottle What kind of life are you gonna?

69
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:13,231
Speaker 1: I actually understand those people's pain because I drank from like the ages of 10 to 23 or 24 dull 100% pineapple orange juice every morning, and then Just recently perhaps less than a year ago.

70
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:15,520
Speaker 1: They changed it completely.

71
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:16,223
Speaker 1: It's still.

72
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:20,620
Speaker 1: you can go and still to the store to buy dull a hundred percent pineapple orange juice.

73
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:22,380
Speaker 1: But they changed the flavor.

74
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:27,134
Speaker 1: It's now actually more apple juice than either orange or pineapple.

75
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:32,915
Speaker 1: it used to be just orange Pineapple and like a squirt of lemon and maybe some vitamin C or something.

76
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:36,640
Speaker 0: see that's actually a trend That's been going on in the US for a long time now where?

77
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:41,220
Speaker 0: Apple juice is kind of like how they make chocolate ice cream where the chocolate overpowers everything else.

78
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,014
Speaker 0: They don't worry about it.

79
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:47,650
Speaker 0: Apple juice is so neutral that in a lot of fruit drinks They sweeten it mostly with apple juice.

80
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,039
Speaker 0: then they add a little bit of whatever flavoring to it in the end.

81
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:52,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the pineapple orange juice did not.

82
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,318
Speaker 1: I drank it because it was so acidic But it didn't have that you know.

83
00:05:57,901 --> 00:06:10,898
Speaker 1: It's sort of like the pineapple canceled out the part of the orange flavor that I wasn't super fond of You know But it was acidic enough to clean out my whole throat in the morning When they added mostly apple juice to it, and it's now like more than 50% apple juice.

84
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:13,447
Speaker 1: It didn't do the same thing anymore.

85
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:14,009
Speaker 1: I might as well.

86
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:16,940
Speaker 1: Just drank an apple juice cuz it wasn't acidic at all.

87
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:21,803
Speaker 1: So I went back and I now I just drink God he.

88
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:27,660
Speaker 1: I tried to mix orange and pineapple juice together and like squirt lemon juice into it, and it totally didn't work.

89
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,774
Speaker 0: So now I just got wasn't doing well for about three weeks every morning.

90
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:37,422
Speaker 0: He'd get up, and I'd hear him downstairs just This

91
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:39,149
Speaker 1: imagine if you drank this

92
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:52,558
Speaker 0: I'd come home like I'd get up like he get up before me And I'd wake up to get ready for work or whatever and I'd see like three glasses dirty with various Concoctions and like the pineapple juice in that laying on the floor Scott on the ground naked crying

93
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:53,260
Speaker 1: wasn't that bad.

94
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:00,319
Speaker 1: But imagine if you drank the same thing for like over ten years every day And then it changed and you could never get any ever again.

95
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,714
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm over it now mostly, but if I saw some for sale.

96
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:05,657
Speaker 1: I totally buy it.

97
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,243
Speaker 0: oh Well in the end.

98
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,730
Speaker 0: I do will I agree with Scott though.

99
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,700
Speaker 0: I kind of like the new aesthetic of the coke hands.

100
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:11,164
Speaker 0: It's really?

101
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:12,779
Speaker 0: it really is kind of old-school.

102
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:19,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, old-school is definitely cool because uh people have nostalgia for times from before they were born.

103
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:22,891
Speaker 0: actually People have nostalgia for times that never existed.

104
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:25,200
Speaker 0: really there was a really cool Scott.

105
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:28,500
Speaker 0: I'll if I find it I'll make it a thing of the day whenever I find it again.

106
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,520
Speaker 0: But I read an article a while ago about a brand of root beer.

107
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:39,700
Speaker 0: I don't remember what brand of root beer it was, but they did a bunch of studies about Nostalgia and memory and they made fake commercials and all this stuff.

108
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:46,020
Speaker 0: And they basically give people different kinds of root beer and ask them questions about their childhood like do you remember drinking?

109
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:47,339
Speaker 0: This is a kid you remember.

110
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:48,764
Speaker 0: What do you remember about it?

111
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:53,800
Speaker 0: and a lot of people when the brand presented to them was some sort of old-timey?

112
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:01,560
Speaker 0: Styling or nostalgic styling drink would remember drinking it as a child when in fact it did not exist when they were children.

113
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:07,034
Speaker 0: Wow It's very easy to alter non-critical memories in humans.

114
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:08,920
Speaker 0: There's actually a lot of cool research about that.

115
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:12,340
Speaker 1: It's like de Bellas is actually called what nostalgia incorporated.

116
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:19,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess a lot of it is like I wasn't alive until the 80s early 80s.

117
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,725
Speaker 1: Well, I'm like.

118
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:30,611
Speaker 1: I sort of believe that a lot of these things existed before I was born Despite you know not really making sure of it even recently.

119
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:35,405
Speaker 0: a lot of people our age remember Pokemon from way before Pokemon came to the US.

120
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,049
Speaker 1: that's true Pokemon.

121
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,638
Speaker 1: was it with the late 90s something like the Pokemons?

122
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,980
Speaker 0: a relative Oh God, I was about to say it's over like 10 years old.

123
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:45,751
Speaker 0: I was about to say relatively recent.

124
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:46,737
Speaker 0: cuz think about it the mid 90s.

125
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,080
Speaker 1: No, the first Pokemon game was for the original game boy.

126
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:51,124
Speaker 0: No, but think of this.

127
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,574
Speaker 0: the mid 90s doesn't sound like it was that long ago.

128
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,920
Speaker 1: No, it's over a decade.

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,115
Speaker 1: I know Pokemon's real old.

130
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:03,460
Speaker 0: All right Now they're on Pokemon meaning I've very nicely brought this conversation right back around to video games.

131
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,672
Speaker 0: What's your video game news?

132
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:09,591
Speaker 1: All right, so Metal Gear Solid 3. that's a game that I knew existed.

133
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:11,557
Speaker 1: It's it's a. it's a ps2 game.

134
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,193
Speaker 1: I Think it's called like substance or subsistence or whatever.

135
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:18,320
Speaker 1: I don't know the word that comes after the colon.

136
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,746
Speaker 0: We're the best game journalists ever.

137
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:22,758
Speaker 0: We play what DS is and that's it something like that.

138
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:28,435
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's a game and actually I think I saw someone Greg playing it once.

139
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:30,100
Speaker 1: it's one with the camouflages and all that stuff.

140
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,680
Speaker 1: Yeah Apparently I did not know this game had an online component.

141
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:43,787
Speaker 1: Now as you might imagine it's a ps2 game with an online component Like who the hell has the ps2 modem?

142
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:44,790
Speaker 1: barely anybody.

143
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:48,460
Speaker 1: and you know who the hell has Metal Gear Solid 3 and the ps2 modem?

144
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,580
Speaker 1: Not too many people and in the US not too many people.

145
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:59,880
Speaker 1: But apparently it does exist and you can play Metal Gear Solid 3 online with the ps2 in the US.

146
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:01,305
Speaker 1: I didn't know this.

147
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,140
Speaker 0: Wow good job for keeping those servers up for the few people left.

148
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,289
Speaker 0: That's a really nice thing to do.

149
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:11,334
Speaker 1: Oh, no an April 2nd They're gonna take them servers down because barely anyone plays this thing.

150
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:17,271
Speaker 0: Ah This illustrates a lot of things that are wrong with the world today.

151
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:22,085
Speaker 0: one, it's tribes 2. all over again I feel for anyone who still plays this game.

152
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:28,663
Speaker 1: Well, I mean first of all, um, why the hell you playing Metal Gear Solid 3 Multiplayer?

153
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:32,240
Speaker 1: shouldn't you like get a 360 and maybe some Gears of War or something?

154
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,308
Speaker 0: Hey some you have nostalgia for games.

155
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:37,624
Speaker 0: or if you find a game that's Metal Gear Solid 3 You never know.

156
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:38,489
Speaker 0: that might have been.

157
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,177
Speaker 0: I mean that might have been some kids.

158
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:41,081
Speaker 0: quake 2.

159
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:42,728
Speaker 0: You can't really take that away from people.

160
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:43,711
Speaker 1: It's a sad kid.

161
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:45,779
Speaker 0: Hey, I'm trying to be nice here.

162
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:49,800
Speaker 0: All right, wait - is still perhaps one of the best FPS has ever created.

163
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,947
Speaker 1: But I don't know about that name.

164
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:57,507
Speaker 0: a better one other than tribes - he's half-life - Half-life - right.

165
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,261
Speaker 0: Yeah, there aren't many half-life 1.

166
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:02,006
Speaker 0: Half-life 1. multiplayer was pretty man.

167
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:03,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

168
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:04,392
Speaker 0: All right.

169
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:05,656
Speaker 0: Okay, so that's it.

170
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:06,719
Speaker 0: They're shutting it down.

171
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:14,282
Speaker 1: Yep it's like They're taking servers down that I didn't even realize existed Which you know.

172
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:30,600
Speaker 1: while we're always sort of worried that when you have an online game with some sort of corporate controlled centralized servers That you could be totally screwed if they decide to take those servers down Especially for MMO people who might have paid like for a year of service or something like that and then it goes down.

173
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:32,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, now a lot of people yell at us nerds.

174
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,877
Speaker 0: Hey, that's not something you should care about.

175
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:35,560
Speaker 0: that won't happen.

176
00:11:36,064 --> 00:11:47,330
Speaker 1: Well, it does happen But it is good to see that usually it happens when the game is really really dead And not when the game is sort of thriving at least not usually.

177
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,518
Speaker 1: I mean this game Metal Gear Solid 3 online is pretty dead.

178
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:58,880
Speaker 0: You got any numbers for all you know, that's like the hot shit on the internet.

179
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,020
Speaker 1: I guess it is possible.

180
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:08,503
Speaker 1: There could be a lot of people playing this but just my guess as to how many people with ps2s that are online Playing this game.

181
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:10,289
Speaker 1: It can't be that many.

182
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:11,874
Speaker 1: It really can't be.

183
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:13,620
Speaker 1: this now is not possible.

184
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:32,500
Speaker 1: so the fact that they'll keep these servers on that long is Kind of good, but the fact that it's even possible for games to stop existing is kind of sad things of the day.

185
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:39,265
Speaker 0: Scott's running with it with his little theme here and I got to say the one he's got tonight is Probably the best one.

186
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:40,168
Speaker 0: I don't know.

187
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:42,857
Speaker 0: It's a tough call in terms of accuracy.

188
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:50,698
Speaker 1: Uh perhaps Perhaps there were some ones that are really close like the Disney ones are spot fucking on.

189
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:51,260
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

190
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:53,388
Speaker 0: Well, this is a non Disney one, which means you.

191
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:56,579
Speaker 0: so I'm surprised at the level of care put into it.

192
00:12:56,994 --> 00:13:03,360
Speaker 1: Yeah It's pretty surprising when you really think about it outside of the major studios like Disney and Warner Brothers.

193
00:13:04,002 --> 00:13:15,140
Speaker 1: a lot of the cartoons don't have opening theme songs with lots of vocal complexity and lots of lyrics and words and The ones that do they sound really bad.

194
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:19,220
Speaker 1: It's like only Disney and Warner Brothers can come up with theme songs that have lots of words in them.

195
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:21,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's the occasional good rare one.

196
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:25,097
Speaker 0: Like I will admit the sonic underground opener for what it is.

197
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:25,979
Speaker 0: I kind of like it.

198
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,855
Speaker 0: Okay, the lyrics aren't that bad the only art that's really cheesy it.

199
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:36,125
Speaker 0: well nevermind I'll get into that when we actually talk about it.

200
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:42,665
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Disney and Warner Brothers also seem to be the only people who can Internationalize their theme songs.

201
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:45,996
Speaker 1: very well, you know when the songs are song in different languages.

202
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:58,090
Speaker 1: They don't change the songs They just translate the lyrics to a different language and it seems to somehow work out whereas other people just don't even have lyrical openers to avoid the problem entirely.

203
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:05,199
Speaker 1: or They don't change the words and translate them when they bring them to another country and such and such.

204
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:08,535
Speaker 1: well Today is I have for you a thing of the day.

205
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:09,400
Speaker 1: That is a rarity.

206
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:20,908
Speaker 1: It is not Warner Brothers nor is it Disney but it does have a lyrically complex opening song That is translated to German Almost perfectly now.

207
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:28,759
Speaker 0: Not only that I think what really gets it here Is that they found a German guy who can sound exactly like captain Lou Albano?

208
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:32,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess you could say that it's so perfect.

209
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:35,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's actually kind of surprising a lot of the voice acting too.

210
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:40,289
Speaker 1: when you hear it is like wow There's someone who sounds exactly like that guy.

211
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:43,600
Speaker 1: only he's a different guy and he speaks a different language.

212
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:44,383
Speaker 1: Look at that.

213
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:50,088
Speaker 1: But yeah, the Super Mario Brothers Super Show opener in German enjoy.

214
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,460
Speaker 0: so speaking of Sonic Underground.

215
00:14:53,082 --> 00:15:09,479
Speaker 0: Sonic Underground was also released in France and the French opener to Sonic Underground is the exact same song just translated pretty much straight up into French though the guys singing it has a more stereotypically French sounding accent than one would expect.

216
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:16,373
Speaker 0: Oh But the thing is I will admit that I do from.

217
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:28,115
Speaker 0: ah, not only do I really like Manowar but I also like listening to Manowar singing in French and This kind of rock in French is actually music that I kind of enjoy.

218
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:33,773
Speaker 0: That's all you Plus Sonic Underground for all of its faults.

219
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,640
Speaker 0: that show tried.

220
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:39,818
Speaker 0: It tried to do more than you would have expected from children's television of the era.

221
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess maybe it's closer to a bad anime than it is to a bad American cartoon.

222
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:54,758
Speaker 0: I'll put it that way maybe in terms of what the way the plot goes and in France, it's called Sonic Laravel Laravel.

223
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:59,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you don't have it I guess because they won't not sing Sonic Resistance.

224
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:13,113
Speaker 1: Well, there you have it two openers to video game related cartoons and Languages other than English, of course you get.

225
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:16,218
Speaker 0: if you really want to get ahead of yourself You can go to Scott's blog and look at ya.

226
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:20,540
Speaker 1: I basically went around YouTube for a couple hours today listing these things.

227
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:30,480
Speaker 0: So if you go, you know to the forums, I made a post about it and yeah, that's you're probably better off Just going to the ones we pick his things of the day just because we're kind of filtering them.

228
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,704
Speaker 0: They're not all amazing.

229
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:33,308
Speaker 0: Some of them are just oh, wow.

230
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:36,017
Speaker 0: It's the Transformers in Spanish.

231
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:38,521
Speaker 1: Yep Wow Yep.

232
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:40,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got some good ones tomorrow too.

233
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:43,377
Speaker 1: So I might bring out the heavy hitters tomorrow.

234
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:44,320
Speaker 0: I got a heavy hitter.

235
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:47,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll say I don't know if you're gonna try to steal what I want.

236
00:16:47,677 --> 00:16:48,140
Speaker 0: No, I'm not.

237
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,563
Speaker 0: I'm not.

238
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:50,840
Speaker 0: the one I'm gonna use is also awesome.

239
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,767
Speaker 0: It's not the one you're thinking of.

240
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:53,319
Speaker 0: but anyway, okay get off of that.

241
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:58,540
Speaker 0: It is video game day and we've been talking a lot about what have we been doing on video game days the last few.

242
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,272
Speaker 1: I've been talking about board games and stuff like that.

243
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:02,337
Speaker 1: I don't even remember.

244
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:08,632
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, whenever we don't have a better topic We usually think all right what games have we played before that?

245
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:10,940
Speaker 0: We don't need to prepare it all to talk about.

246
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:15,000
Speaker 1: Well, there is one game that came out the the most recent game.

247
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,319
Speaker 1: well not the most recent game on the virtual console but a Recent virtual console release that I purchased because I never owned it before in my life, which I couldn't believe.

248
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,137
Speaker 0: I didn't know that until Scott told me just a few days ago.

249
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:30,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, and But I played it many times before in my life a whole lot actually.

250
00:17:31,603 --> 00:17:32,648
Speaker 1: So I decided you know what?

251
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,954
Speaker 1: I've never bought this game yet.

252
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,040
Speaker 1: I've played the hell out of it.

253
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:37,632
Speaker 1: I should pay eight bucks for it or whatever.

254
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:38,435
Speaker 1: Where the five bucks.

255
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:39,460
Speaker 1: I don't know what they were charging.

256
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,370
Speaker 1: Haha Nintendo you I think it was eight bucks.

257
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:51,396
Speaker 0: Nintendo is once again getting us Pirates born and bred for most of our lives who have access to superior emulation.

258
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:52,780
Speaker 0: We had Nintendo's.

259
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:54,893
Speaker 0: I owned this game.

260
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:56,000
Speaker 0: I still own it.

261
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,200
Speaker 0: I have the cartridge and a Super Nintendo and yet we'll spend money to play it on the Wii.

262
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:08,780
Speaker 1: Yep So I got Super Mario World the one with Yoshi the first Super Nintendo Mario game.

263
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,879
Speaker 1: Are you believe Mario were all Super Mario Brothers for you?

264
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,140
Speaker 0: Are you believe the best or one of the best Mario games ever?

265
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,839
Speaker 0: I mean pretty much it and Mario 3 are at a dead heat in my book.

266
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you ask me, I'll give Mario 3 the slight edge, but that's not to say Mario World is not to awesome.

267
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's no way for you to know if that might be partly due to nostalgia for having played one of them a lot more.

268
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:37,174
Speaker 1: You know I think the reason I kind of like Mario 3 a little bit more is.

269
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:51,775
Speaker 1: it seems like Mario 3 has more that old-school hiddenness that like, you know The Metroids would have and you know stuff like that, you know Whereas Mario World the hiddenness is a little more open and out there.

270
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:53,340
Speaker 1: so it's not as exciting.

271
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:58,840
Speaker 0: It's more Zelda II like in Mario 3. you'd never know that you can go behind the scenery on white pillars.

272
00:18:59,335 --> 00:19:06,580
Speaker 1: Yeah You would never know that you could get that coin Crazy coin ship by getting enough coins in this level that scrolls really fast.

273
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:07,967
Speaker 1: You never know that you could

274
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:08,630
Speaker 0: fly

275
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:17,080
Speaker 1: off the screen in a particular place Carrying a turtle shell to bust a brick to get inside a pipe that takes you to fuck who knows where

276
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:22,038
Speaker 0: Or going to the far right of the desert using two hammers on blocks that have

277
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:22,560
Speaker 1: one hammer.

278
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:24,127
Speaker 0: I guess you need one.

279
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,132
Speaker 1: You only needed one hammer.

280
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:30,120
Speaker 0: if you don't waste your hammer on something else I've never actually bothered to go get that warp whistle.

281
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,024
Speaker 0: I just knew it was there.

282
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:32,712
Speaker 0: cuz you only need two warp whistles.

283
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:34,460
Speaker 0: You don't need a third one.

284
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:51,667
Speaker 1: I would go get it just because I would get all three and then cuz see my strategy to beat Mario 3. well, I was talking about Mario 3. now is I would get all three of the warp whistles, right and Because I. what I would do is as soon as I got to world 3 I would beat the boss of world to the desert.

285
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:59,771
Speaker 1: then I would warp to world 8 because only then you wing Extra p-wings and clouds because beat level 2 you get a cloud.

286
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:05,111
Speaker 1: that way I would have exactly the number of p-wings and clouds I needed to get to the end of world 8.

287
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:13,772
Speaker 0: man clouds are dangerous though Cuz if there's a level that's hard and you skip over it with the cloud and then you die in the next level It's not good.

288
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:18,140
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, we're not gonna talk about Mario 3 but I'm Mario world.

289
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:27,273
Speaker 0: I mean the secrets are there but they're Zelda II where you'll be up and you'll see like hey There's a key and a keyhole over behind that pipe and I can't get over there.

290
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,216
Speaker 0: Huh?

291
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:29,360
Speaker 0: I wonder how I get that?

292
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:33,770
Speaker 1: Yep, or you'll go over to a level and on the map The level will be like a red dot.

293
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:37,227
Speaker 1: and if the level is a red dot, you know That level has multiple exits.

294
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:43,639
Speaker 1: or you'll go into a boo house and a boo house Obviously has mad boo secrets in it.

295
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:52,228
Speaker 1: so you'll explore the hell out of that boo house and you'll use your p-blocks all over the place and It's pretty obvious where a lot of the things are like.

296
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:55,358
Speaker 1: hey, there's some coins outlining the shape of a door.

297
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:59,848
Speaker 0: I wonder Yeah, there's also now that I think about it.

298
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,860
Speaker 0: Mario 3 was one of the last of those old-school.

299
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:05,448
Speaker 0: Winning is not a foregone conclusion.

300
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:14,594
Speaker 0: in Mario 3 and even as a kid when I was badass at that game Sometimes I would sit down and say I'm going to beat Mario 3 and fail.

301
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:16,379
Speaker 0: Yeah and one out of lives.

302
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,124
Speaker 0: There's no continue.

303
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:19,709
Speaker 0: There's no saving.

304
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,760
Speaker 0: you got to go and beat it before mom calls for dinner.

305
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:32,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also Mario World you basically have infinite lives effectively unless you suck and the game saves So you're gonna beat it eventually and once you beat it, you're done.

306
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:38,284
Speaker 0: That's not a big trend in games over the last many years that it went from this Beat the game.

307
00:21:38,404 --> 00:21:40,130
Speaker 0: beating the game is the end.

308
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,683
Speaker 0: the means are entertaining but the end is beating it - You're going to beat the game.

309
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:50,379
Speaker 0: No matter what the game is more about going around and actually getting everything over time.

310
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,113
Speaker 0: It's like progress as opposed to one straight shot.

311
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:54,821
Speaker 0: Yep Great.

312
00:21:54,841 --> 00:22:03,598
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not a big deal, but super mario world I actually did own as a kid and I beat all the way through and I think it's my favorite Mario game.

313
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's a damn good Mario game.

314
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,129
Speaker 1: I remember when I first heard about it.

315
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:10,076
Speaker 1: I was like a cape a Yoshi.

316
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:11,080
Speaker 1: What's that crap?

317
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,767
Speaker 1: What happened to the raccoon tail?

318
00:22:12,787 --> 00:22:15,060
Speaker 1: because I like the Mario 3 action, you know.

319
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,480
Speaker 1: But the thing was as much as I didn't like Yoshi before I got to you know to use Yoshi.

320
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:23,624
Speaker 1: When you got Yoshi, he was awesome You know and it's pretty.

321
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:25,130
Speaker 1: it was like before Yoshi.

322
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:29,611
Speaker 1: you looked at him and you said I don't like why they throw in His green dinosaur into my Mario world.

323
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:30,536
Speaker 1: I don't want him in here.

324
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:31,080
Speaker 1: get him out.

325
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:31,582
Speaker 0: See now.

326
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:34,497
Speaker 0: the reason I didn't worry about that was think Mario 1 came out.

327
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:34,959
Speaker 0: great game.

328
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,346
Speaker 0: Yep, Mario 2 u.s.

329
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:38,489
Speaker 0: Style came out.

330
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,640
Speaker 0: Uh now that's also but it's my number 3 Mario game.

331
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:48,600
Speaker 0: I mean, I can't save Mario world or Mario 3 is better overall, but Mario 2 is the number 2 as far as I'm concerned.

332
00:22:49,364 --> 00:22:50,288
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

333
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:51,555
Speaker 0: I really like Mario.

334
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:58,278
Speaker 1: I like Mario 2 Doki-doki panic also, but I'm not gonna give it incredible praise or anything.

335
00:22:58,338 --> 00:22:58,860
Speaker 1: It's a good game.

336
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:02,661
Speaker 0: Well, maybe I mean my like if it is a lot like my like for Zelda 2.

337
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:04,768
Speaker 0: Maybe for some reason it just grabbed me.

338
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:05,531
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

339
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:09,950
Speaker 0: it's definitely not sequels cuz I hate most sequels Yeah, but no, I don't quake - damn it.

340
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:25,480
Speaker 0: Yeah Alrighty, but Mario - as far as the Americans saw it was this totally different game where they threw in all these new weird Monsters and weird mechanics and all these things that never bet they weren't in the other Mario game.

341
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,425
Speaker 0: It was like this, you know what?

342
00:23:26,747 --> 00:23:28,960
Speaker 0: like you see a shy guy you're like, wow, that's weird.

343
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:40,920
Speaker 0: But then you play Mario World or Mario 3 and you think back and you feel like those shy guys and those ninjies had Always been in Mario and you can't imagine them having not been in the Mario universe.

344
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:44,036
Speaker 1: Actually, you know what is now that I think back on it.

345
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:49,700
Speaker 1: when I was a kid I never felt like Mario 2 was really a sequel to Mario.

346
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:54,240
Speaker 1: I you know it because I also had the Zelda 2 which didn't feel like a sequel to Zelda.

347
00:23:54,361 --> 00:24:04,563
Speaker 1: It felt like some other game with the same character Felt like some other game with the same character even though in both cases the instruction books very clearly made the Lineage known.

348
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:11,240
Speaker 1: Yep, but Mario 3 really felt like a sequel and Mario World definitely felt like a sequel to Mario 3.

349
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,784
Speaker 0: Hmm, but you were talking about you know, Yoshi like why are they adding this weird thing?

350
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:21,551
Speaker 0: but every Mario game added weird stuff and it felt uneasy or strange or Like just tacked on like.

351
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:22,840
Speaker 0: ah, they're just trying to add something.

352
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:31,980
Speaker 1: Actually before playing Mario 3 and I knew about the tail it was like, ah, yeah But before playing Mario World Yoshi was like what?

353
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, why I had the different feeling?

354
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:37,400
Speaker 0: but well, that's just Yoshi, but all the stuff in Mario World.

355
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,712
Speaker 1: I don't know some of the stuff in Mario World.

356
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:42,586
Speaker 0: I kind of accepted the football Koopa Troopa guys.

357
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:43,269
Speaker 1: I love those guys.

358
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:45,740
Speaker 0: I like him too, but they were definitely a strange addition.

359
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,551
Speaker 1: I guess you could say so.

360
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:53,320
Speaker 1: but yeah once Like the some of this stuff definitely flowed naturally like the boo houses.

361
00:24:53,581 --> 00:24:59,980
Speaker 1: It's like a Mario 3. there were boos and in Mario World who houses it was just a natural progression.

362
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:04,640
Speaker 0: I guess the thing I'm talking I'm thinking about more is the idea that it's the nostalgia factor.

363
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:08,110
Speaker 0: You forget that there weren't boos until Mario 3.

364
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,882
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of that people there weren't boos until Mario 3.

365
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:17,748
Speaker 1: You know where else there were boos though, I think in Yoshi the game just Yoshi.

366
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:19,014
Speaker 1: I think that had boos in it.

367
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:20,480
Speaker 0: I don't know.

368
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:22,180
Speaker 1: I think it did anyway.

369
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,324
Speaker 0: But the other thing music.

370
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:35,109
Speaker 0: to think about some of the songs that are so iconic to Mario and then realize that They were didn't exist until Super Mario World and yet now they're just they're part of the Mario universe And you can't imagine that they were never there.

371
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:37,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's actually kind of true.

372
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:39,598
Speaker 1: Sometimes I forget like which songs.

373
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,721
Speaker 1: I mean It's obvious which songs started in Mario 1 and it's obvious which songs came from Mario 2.

374
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:52,860
Speaker 1: But sometimes like I forget which songs started in Mario 3 and which ones started in Mario World and when they you play a game.

375
00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:02,716
Speaker 1: Now like you pick up say new Mario Brothers for the DS, and they play a Mario song you go That's a Mario song and someone goes up to you and goes yeah, which Mario song?

376
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:03,519
Speaker 1: and you go uh?

377
00:26:05,102 --> 00:26:17,555
Speaker 1: And some of them are easy like oh, that's the castle music from Mario 3 or oh That's the boo house music from Mario World, but sometimes you're like uh And it feels like that music has always been Mario music.

378
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:20,547
Speaker 1: you want to say Mario 1 But you know that's not true.

379
00:26:20,888 --> 00:26:23,057
Speaker 1: It wasn't in there until Mario 4.

380
00:26:23,057 --> 00:26:23,680
Speaker 1: Holy crap

381
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:47,540
Speaker 0: I think that is the sign of an extremely well done franchise that Nintendo has had such foresight and that when they or maybe it was random chance I don't know who knows but the fact that the continuity is so smooth even when there are jarring Transitions from game to game that the feeling that the universe is unified and when you see a thing from a Mario game you feel Like it's always been there without question.

382
00:26:48,202 --> 00:27:02,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you can change something and then as much as you have compared Mario 1 to Mario Sunshine Yeah, hey, it's like if you change the can of coke and then later if you change it again people are upset.

383
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:09,780
Speaker 1: You know you've done a good change because what you changed it to is just as beloved as what you had before.

384
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:12,978
Speaker 1: So let's talk about Mario World more specifically.

385
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:20,360
Speaker 0: well The plot is that the princess has been kidnapped by Koopa and your here's Koopa kids.

386
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:22,756
Speaker 1: Well, it's not the Koopa kid that you know.

387
00:27:22,817 --> 00:27:33,645
Speaker 1: nowadays It's the same Koopa kids that were in Mario 3. see if you played Mario 3 in Mario World King Koopa had what like seven kids I think bunch of kids.

388
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:36,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Iggy Koopa Wendy was the worst one.

389
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:46,249
Speaker 1: Wendy was the bitch God when with those candy rings that she threw around and and Ludwig von Koopa and All sorts of other what were the other camera?

390
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,318
Speaker 1: if you can name all the Koopa kids you win a prize.

391
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:49,603
Speaker 1: Yeah Nothing.

392
00:27:49,643 --> 00:27:57,999
Speaker 0: I've got this great piece of art that I still have to hang on the wall of the real awesome new Koopa kid Who's one of my favorite characters in any video game ever?

393
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:03,060
Speaker 0: Being beat up and trying to get away from all of his I guess stepbrothers and his stepsister.

394
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,011
Speaker 1: Yeah, the old Koopa kids that were from Mario 3 in Mario World.

395
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:08,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's by that Brandon Kramer guy who we keep talking about.

396
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:10,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, the awesome art, dude.

397
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,970
Speaker 1: Anyway, so basically you're Mario.

398
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:15,700
Speaker 1: you go from level to level world to world.

399
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:23,180
Speaker 1: Each world has one Koopa kid as the boss and in the final world Bowser is the boss and he's a motherfucker.

400
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:36,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, it follows the same kind of idea of Mario 3 where there's this overworld and you travel along lines from dot to dot Going into worlds and fighting and sometimes there are multiple paths or secrets or different ways to go.

401
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:38,239
Speaker 0: But there's a big wide world to explore.

402
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:41,855
Speaker 0: Unlike Mario 3 you can go between worlds easily.

403
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:47,720
Speaker 1: You can also Revisit worlds which is a huge difference from Mario 3. in Mario 3 you would beat a world.

404
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,004
Speaker 1: The world is beaten.

405
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:50,449
Speaker 1: you can't go back into it.

406
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,640
Speaker 1: in Mario world you go back into a level.

407
00:28:54,041 --> 00:29:01,833
Speaker 1: You can like pick up a mushroom at the beginning of it and then quit or you can go into a level Pick up the one secret you missed and then quit the level.

408
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:09,859
Speaker 1: as soon as you get the secret, you know It's allows you to just keep Experiencing any part of the game you want to experience at any time.

409
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:14,401
Speaker 0: Yeah, not many games really use that mechanic until after Mario 3.

410
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:18,432
Speaker 1: Well games had a mechanic where you could see.

411
00:29:18,472 --> 00:29:25,760
Speaker 1: this is kind of weird because Mario world is one of the first games to Let you revisit levels, but you never had to revisit a level.

412
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:33,580
Speaker 1: There was no reason to other than to get you know, say pick up a mushroom You know easily in an easy level or to reopen a secret that you didn't open.

413
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you don't need any of the secrets to win the game.

414
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,359
Speaker 1: Oh need them.

415
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,023
Speaker 1: You know there was.

416
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:40,580
Speaker 1: there's no reason to or necessarily miss of backtracking.

417
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:49,910
Speaker 0: Well, it can be necessary in the in the mystic forest if there's that one level where if you beat it by one exit It actually makes a loop that doesn't take you anywhere.

418
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,994
Speaker 0: Then you have to go back in.

419
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:52,480
Speaker 1: I guess it could be necessary.

420
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,907
Speaker 1: Yes, but it's not in general now.

421
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:55,689
Speaker 1: It's just general.

422
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,460
Speaker 1: it is possible to beat the game without repeating any levels, you know.

423
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:10,175
Speaker 1: But yeah, it wasn't until much after Mario world where they actually made games where backtracking was Important and useful and you needed to do it a lot more.

424
00:30:10,196 --> 00:30:13,596
Speaker 1: in Mario world You only could do it to get some extra secrets.

425
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:24,855
Speaker 0: now We don't really need to talk much more about how Super Mario World worked if you if you've played the game before you know how it worked if You've never played it and you have a Wii and you don't feel like dealing with emulation.

426
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:26,180
Speaker 0: I highly recommend it.

427
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:28,499
Speaker 0: It is one of the best Mario games ever.

428
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:30,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're pretty much it's.

429
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:32,840
Speaker 1: you're not a gamer if you haven't played beaten Mario world.

430
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,382
Speaker 1: I mean, it's.

431
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:36,980
Speaker 0: it's so classic it it's like having not seen Star Wars.

432
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:43,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I'm going to try to beat the game a hundred percent every single level and every single secret.

433
00:30:43,727 --> 00:30:44,560
Speaker 1: But you don't have to do that.

434
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,948
Speaker 1: You just have to beat the game straight through and that's good enough.

435
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:50,620
Speaker 1: But if you haven't played it at all Wow, that's scary.

436
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:56,620
Speaker 0: So let's talk about all the interesting fun things in this game because one thing houses boo houses.

437
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,979
Speaker 0: I don't think you all understand Scott's fetish for boo.

438
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:04,972
Speaker 0: Banish Scott has this unhealthy obsession with boo though.

439
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:06,335
Speaker 0: I'll admit boo is pretty awesome.

440
00:31:06,355 --> 00:31:07,277
Speaker 0: So who is the awesome?

441
00:31:07,378 --> 00:31:08,180
Speaker 0: I understand it.

442
00:31:08,964 --> 00:31:11,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's got a stuffed boo that he has in his room.

443
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:20,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically in Mario 3 there was boo But all boo was was the ghost and if you looked at him He would cover his eyes and if he turns your back to him, he would sneak up on you.

444
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,116
Speaker 0: now This is really cute in and of itself.

445
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:29,680
Speaker 1: Yeah Well Mario World had the same boo that you had in Mario 3. it also had a whole bunch more boos.

446
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:35,320
Speaker 0: There were silly boos and shy boos and gigantic boos and boos came in different formations.

447
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,980
Speaker 1: Like some boos would turn into rocks that you could stand on when you looked at him.

448
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,898
Speaker 1: But if you looked away, they turn into a boo and try to get you.

449
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:47,479
Speaker 1: There would be gigantic boos that you had to jump over without touching them.

450
00:31:48,028 --> 00:31:54,720
Speaker 1: there would be Rings of boos that would spin around and only live you what like one point of entry if you wanted to jump through them.

451
00:31:55,081 --> 00:32:02,985
Speaker 1: There would be like millions of boos flying in the ceiling and then they would swoop down on you trying to get you like the Sun in Mario 3 did.

452
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,871
Speaker 0: those are actually my favorite kinds of boos.

453
00:32:04,891 --> 00:32:05,453
Speaker 0: They were kind.

454
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:11,459
Speaker 0: they were like this mass of Semi-translucent boos that would materialize whenever you got near him and swoop in.

455
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:22,618
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were lots of crazy different boos and it definitely it always felt cool Cuz you'd be these haunted houses that you had to go into and Yoshi wouldn't go inside.

456
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:24,104
Speaker 0: Yeah Yoshi How useless are you?

457
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:26,092
Speaker 0: whenever I really need you you abandon me?

458
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you had Yoshi in a boo house Holy shit, you could wreck that place up.

459
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:32,728
Speaker 1: cuz you get hit by a boo You just land on Yoshi again.

460
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:34,339
Speaker 1: hit by a boo land on Yoshi again.

461
00:32:35,181 --> 00:32:35,845
Speaker 1: It'd be all great.

462
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:38,479
Speaker 1: But no, he doesn't come with you in the boo house makes it all hard.

463
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:57,798
Speaker 1: But yeah, the boo houses were always cool because they were less about the platforming jumping from thing to thing you know tricky timing and maneuvering and reflexes that the other levels had and it was more about finding the secret way to go to different paths while these ghosts were pestering you.

464
00:32:57,979 --> 00:33:02,421
Speaker 1: and Basically the ghosts work to limit your time in the level I mean.

465
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:04,230
Speaker 1: if the ghosts weren't there it would be stupid.

466
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,280
Speaker 1: easy because you could just walk around and do whatever you want.

467
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:13,520
Speaker 1: But because the ghosts are there you pretty much not only get to find these secrets and figure them out with tricky thinking.

468
00:33:14,082 --> 00:33:19,879
Speaker 1: You have to do it really fast because if you don't work fast enough the booze will descend on you and kill you.

469
00:33:20,562 --> 00:33:30,039
Speaker 0: Now the boo house has also had numerous secrets some of which were actually very fucking difficult to get a hold of You mostly cuz booze harassed you while you tried to get them.

470
00:33:30,492 --> 00:33:32,991
Speaker 0: Yeah See one of the great things about this game was the secrets.

471
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:42,430
Speaker 0: and while Scott says he's going to try to beat the game 100% I did so when I was a kid and it took me months months and months most of which was spent

472
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,032
Speaker 1: trying

473
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:50,860
Speaker 0: to beat the star world and the Super secret star world of which Scott was existed was dubious of the existence thereof.

474
00:33:51,162 --> 00:34:05,360
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, cuz I didn't own a Super Nintendo Sega Genesis kid But I played Super Mario World a lot and my friends houses and my cousin's house and I had seen and played The majority of the game, but I had never seen like this double plus star world ever.

475
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:07,300
Speaker 1: So I didn't you know believe it existed.

476
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:12,773
Speaker 0: Yeah So Scott's going around to the star world and I said hey Are you gonna go to tubular and awesome and all those places?

477
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:14,279
Speaker 0: and he's like what what are you talking about?

478
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:17,231
Speaker 0: So I said you see that big pillar in the middle of the star world.

479
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:27,139
Speaker 0: if you beat all the star worlds around You can go up there There's another star and it takes you to this magical world where you can't win and it's fucking impossible.

480
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:30,857
Speaker 0: and I threw the controller at my TV like 12 times as a kid.

481
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:32,860
Speaker 0: and They get.

482
00:34:33,183 --> 00:34:36,219
Speaker 0: each one is harder than the last and they're not like normal Mario levels.

483
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:45,520
Speaker 0: They're like a normal level from these games this game just a little bit bigger Except that you have to get the secret exit to advance and it's just impossible.

484
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,550
Speaker 1: We'll see how I'll do that last.

485
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:57,007
Speaker 0: probably they were really hard But if you beat them all and get to the end you can go in this final star And it changes the rest of the game.

486
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:58,392
Speaker 0: It changes the color palette.

487
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:00,580
Speaker 0: all the coopers are now wearing Mario mask.

488
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,090
Speaker 0: It changes a whole bunch of stuff all over the game permanently.

489
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:04,857
Speaker 1: That's pretty crazy stuff right there.

490
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:10,660
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, another thing I like about the star worlds is that it's sort of like the whole game.

491
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,360
Speaker 1: You have this green Yoshi who does what he does and if he eats certain shells he can do other things.

492
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:20,179
Speaker 1: If you go to the star world you can get these other colored Yoshi's and it's like whoa.

493
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:23,560
Speaker 1: You know remember I was talking about that sort of wonder.

494
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:26,668
Speaker 1: Yeah That sense of wonder and sort of holy crap.

495
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:30,439
Speaker 1: look at that secret that Mario 3 definitely had more of that than Mario.

496
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:30,680
Speaker 1: world.

497
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:34,206
Speaker 0: God when I got a blue Yoshi I was so excited about that.

498
00:35:34,427 --> 00:35:40,687
Speaker 1: cuz but Mario world definitely still had it and where it had it was in the star world Where all this crazy shit was happening.

499
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:44,367
Speaker 0: yep like you'd see you know yellow shells and red shells and blue shells And they did stuff.

500
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:54,619
Speaker 0: and then one day I stumbled upon a flashing shell and I thought to myself I wonder what would happen if Yoshi ate that and it turned out had the powers of all three shells at the same time.

501
00:35:55,102 --> 00:35:56,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was crazy.

502
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:57,860
Speaker 1: It was super crazy.

503
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:03,856
Speaker 0: The game also honestly has one of the best learning curves of any Mario game out there.

504
00:36:04,177 --> 00:36:07,840
Speaker 0: it starts out Really really easy, but not stupidly easy.

505
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:09,360
Speaker 1: That's very true.

506
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:17,003
Speaker 1: I mean most Mario games like the first level of say Mario Brothers 1 is so Easy.

507
00:36:17,184 --> 00:36:20,196
Speaker 1: I mean if you figure out the controls you can beat that level.

508
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:25,020
Speaker 1: you might not beat it well But you can beat it, but then again at least that was the first Mario game.

509
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,460
Speaker 0: So it's not like anyone had any experience and all of us died on their first goomba at least once yep.

510
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:38,294
Speaker 1: But it's you know it's so easy that someone who's good at the game Won't really find it interesting at all in Mario world.

511
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:47,840
Speaker 1: even the earliest levels Which are a lot easier than the later levels are complex enough to still be interesting to play when you have a high skill level.

512
00:36:47,940 --> 00:37:01,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like they have this perfect balance of introducing new elements at a rate to where you will understand them and see their uses Introducing novel uses of things you already knew about Introducing new kinds of enemies new mechanics whatever.

513
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:06,226
Speaker 0: and they do it so that the game never gets old the moment You think you've got the game under control.

514
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:11,303
Speaker 0: it steps the difficulty up this tiny little bit and adds one more little Complication.

515
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:21,540
Speaker 0: and by the end of the game when you're in the mystic forest or by the the ghost ship You'll look back And you'll look at what you're doing in the game and be amazed at how good you are at this game compared to when you started.

516
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:27,828
Speaker 0: Like the game trains you to be good at Mario games Yeah, and like where is a Mario 3?

517
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:32,240
Speaker 1: you know there were different kinds of levels even a Mario 1. there were different kinds of.

518
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:37,654
Speaker 1: There's a normal level an underground level a bridge flying fish level a mushroom.

519
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:41,445
Speaker 0: are the pillars level those long Level?

520
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:42,570
Speaker 1: and underwater level?

521
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:51,580
Speaker 1: and a castle level you know and Mario world They keep throwing all sorts of new kinds of levels at you, and that's what really keeps your interest going.

522
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,640
Speaker 1: I mean you know there'll be one level where dolphins are coming out of the water, and it's crazy.

523
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,183
Speaker 1: It's like whoa.

524
00:37:57,203 --> 00:37:58,249
Speaker 1: This is a new kind of level.

525
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,234
Speaker 1: That's a dolphin level.

526
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:00,180
Speaker 1: what the hell's up with that?

527
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:11,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing is the game has enough novel stuff in it that throughout the entire game You were constantly running into new things Until the very end where it takes all the things you've learned and throws them at you as hard as possible.

528
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:13,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're never gonna.

529
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:23,426
Speaker 1: You know you if you keep beating levels You're gonna keep running into new stuff And you're gonna get being excited to keep playing like even as late in the game is the mystic forest Which is pretty late.

530
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:25,397
Speaker 0: you've gone through a lot of the game at that point.

531
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:30,139
Speaker 0: now Bubbles and there's wigglers, and there's bob-omb suddenly.

532
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:38,792
Speaker 1: and Yeah, I mean even mario 3 didn't do such a good a job at that You know because mario 3 basically each world had a type of level.

533
00:38:38,832 --> 00:38:43,825
Speaker 1: you know all of the levels in world 7 were Mostly sort of kind of the same.

534
00:38:43,845 --> 00:38:45,549
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean in general you could like something.

535
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:57,060
Speaker 0: there were definitely some water levels and underground levels and platforms moving through the air levels and Standard platformer levels levels that scroll on their own and levels that you scroll.

536
00:38:57,822 --> 00:39:02,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, mario games are all about the kinds of levels at least 2d mario games are.

537
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:03,960
Speaker 1: a lot of people don't realize that.

538
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:09,700
Speaker 0: One thing I do remember from mario 3 though was that the worlds were so different and exotic.

539
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:17,886
Speaker 0: Maybe it was partly because you couldn't save the game so certain levels like level 5 and 6 and 7 you didn't see Often in your life.

540
00:39:18,348 --> 00:39:26,315
Speaker 0: ah like if you wanted very true if you wanted to see these levels You either had to have a game genie Or you just had to start and play through the game enough to get to him.

541
00:39:26,355 --> 00:39:28,264
Speaker 1: so when you got to him you only got To play him once.

542
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:31,580
Speaker 1: as soon as you walked past a pipe that pipe was gone.

543
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:39,872
Speaker 1: You weren't gonna see that pipe unless you died or unless you played the whole game again up to that point And it was definitely the sense of like the cloud world.

544
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:44,513
Speaker 0: and then that's like the tower to the top And you just you know the tower was so hot.

545
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:45,779
Speaker 0: I love that so much.

546
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:50,020
Speaker 0: of course I was kind of pissed when I got to the top and found out there was a whole nother level that was twice as hard.

547
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:58,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, that see the thing is world 5 on the ground is One of the best worlds and that tower is one of the best because they it's like they have a difference.

548
00:39:58,261 --> 00:40:02,441
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know who designed all the different levels like who did what level in Mario 3.

549
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,860
Speaker 0: But I would guess that a different team did world 5.

550
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,320
Speaker 1: Maybe because it's just so different from the whole ride about how they snuck that caribou shoe in there.

551
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,179
Speaker 1: But I don't know why the caribou shoe is not in Mario or curry beau shoe is the dog.

552
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:18,937
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's why I think that's what makes Mario 3 better than Mario world.

553
00:40:19,198 --> 00:40:21,605
Speaker 1: definitely It's that sort of thing, but the end the same time.

554
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:26,800
Speaker 0: Mario world is such a precise polished game with like no flaws.

555
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:30,899
Speaker 0: Well, no flaws other than flaws that are inherent in 2d platformers.

556
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:34,913
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't really see anything wrong with Mario world at all.

557
00:40:34,953 --> 00:40:37,220
Speaker 0: a lot of people don't like the mystic mystic forest world.

558
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:39,932
Speaker 1: I don't like the mystic forest, but just cuz I don't like it.
