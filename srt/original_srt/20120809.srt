1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:08,840
Speaker 1: 

2
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:12,230
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, August 9th, 2012.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,792
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:13,594
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:15,119
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,860
Speaker 0: Tonight, tickets.

7
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:21,564
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:35,677
Speaker 0: You might be able to predict if you have some sort of psychic ability or perhaps some sort of Prince of Nothing, Kellis level human understanding that this is sort of a crab people episode.

9
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:36,640
Speaker 1: No.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,623
Speaker 1: No.

11
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:38,988
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it's a Thursday.

12
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:43,064
Speaker 1: We came up with the book club just to fill in a bunch of Thursday episodes.

13
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:46,898
Speaker 0: Speaking of Thursday, I'm done with The Man Who Was Thursday.

14
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:48,463
Speaker 1: Oh, God, that's so...

15
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:50,290
Speaker 0: Scott, it's a short book.

16
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:53,986
Speaker 1: I've just been reading comics because I have a pile of them that are unread.

17
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:55,212
Speaker 0: You gotta read this.

18
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:56,537
Speaker 0: The book is not what you're expecting.

19
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:57,982
Speaker 1: I already read two chapters.

20
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:02,117
Speaker 0: It gets more and more absurd.

21
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:03,060
Speaker 0: Absurd?

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,501
Speaker 1: Okay.

23
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:04,022
Speaker 0: Yeah.

24
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:05,849
Speaker 1: I read two chapters and it's alright.

25
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:11,767
Speaker 0: It's alright, but it gets... There's a Pepe Le Pew scene, not too far into it with an old guy.

26
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:12,289
Speaker 1: Okay.

27
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,155
Speaker 0: And it just goes off from there.

28
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,508
Speaker 0: What's weird, this is totally a random aside.

29
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:18,050
Speaker 0: It's Thursday.

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:18,612
Speaker 0: It's the lounge.

31
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:19,336
Speaker 0: Talk about whatever we want.

32
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:29,302
Speaker 0: But reading this, the description of the big police chief, end of Sunday, obviously won't mean anything to anyone who's not in the Geek Nights book club and reading the books that we're talking about.

33
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:39,671
Speaker 0: For whatever reason, he reminds me of the primary early antagonist, the leader of the cult from our previous book club book, 1Q84.

34
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:46,970
Speaker 0: The way he is described and his powers and... Well, anyway, I digress.

35
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,818
Speaker 0: So you've been reading comics, not doing anything productive?

36
00:01:49,838 --> 00:01:52,670
Speaker 1: Playing with my new computer.

37
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,129
Speaker 1: You know what's really weird about having my new computer that I bought the Adobe whatnot?

38
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,466
Speaker 1: Having Acrobat and not Acrobat Reader?

39
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:00,687
Speaker 1: Yeah.

40
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:02,254
Speaker 1: It's so weird.

41
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:05,487
Speaker 1: It's like, "Oh, I can just turn anything into a PDF.

42
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:08,097
Speaker 1: Oh, and I can open up a PDF and then I can sort of edit

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:08,941
Speaker 1: it?".

44
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:14,339
Speaker 0: Now, what I love and hate about Adobe is that you said, and that's the key word, sort of edit it.

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,824
Speaker 0: Because I... At my job, like my day job work, we use Confluence, you know, Atlassian for the Wiki?

46
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:22,406
Speaker 0: Okay.

47
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:23,832
Speaker 0: And all our documentation is in there.

48
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:28,448
Speaker 0: And you can export to PDF and use that to generate documentation.

49
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:33,161
Speaker 0: But obviously, page breaks and kerning and stuff doesn't work out so well.

50
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:37,717
Speaker 0: So you can't just open that PDF and reflow it in Adobe.

51
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:38,942
Speaker 0: There's no way to do that.

52
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:42,617
Speaker 0: You basically can't edit anything that you would ever want to edit in Adobe.

53
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:44,003
Speaker 1: Well, there is one thing you can do.

54
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:48,370
Speaker 1: If you go to Atlassian, right, does it have an option to print?

55
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:51,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, do you know what that does?

56
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:53,937
Speaker 1: You go to File, Print, and you print to a PostScript file.

57
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:55,270
Speaker 0: Scott, that looks even worse.

58
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:03,770
Speaker 1: I'm just saying you put the PostScript file into the distiller, then you have a PDF that you can edit fully, but you have to edit it fully.

59
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,058
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what?

60
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:06,430
Speaker 0: That doesn't look any better.

61
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,170
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you have to do work on it to make it look not worse.

62
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:18,037
Speaker 0: The whole point is just that having Adobe Acrobat does not give me significantly more capabilities than I have without it.

63
00:03:18,057 --> 00:03:22,437
Speaker 0: I don't mind having it for free, but I can't imagine a world where I would have paid for it.

64
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:23,180
Speaker 1: No.

65
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,240
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you could use it to make PDFs from scratch or from InDesign.

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,265
Speaker 1: Why would I ever do that?

67
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:31,700
Speaker 0: Every open source everything can export to PDF and it works fine.

68
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:36,060
Speaker 1: You can use InDesign and then make a thing that looks really good and then whatever.

69
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,467
Speaker 0: Or I would just use InDesign.

70
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:38,733
Speaker 0: I don't need Acrobat.

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,902
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

72
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:41,886
Speaker 1: That was my predicament.

73
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,356
Speaker 0: Acrobat doesn't do anything.

74
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,570
Speaker 1: It does a few things.

75
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:53,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does things that ... It does the same level of things, in my opinion, in my professional opinion, that complex Excel macros do.

76
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,635
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it's- Those kinds of people are the kinds of people who use Adobe Acrobat.

77
00:03:56,656 --> 00:04:03,050
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's really weird to double click on a PDF and Acrobat opens and you don't have to go download Acrobat Reader or anything.

78
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,253
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm simply noting the- Or use any of the built in PDF things like in Chrome.

79
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:12,190
Speaker 0: I'm noting the delicious irony that while it's different, you then rapidly realize that it's not as different as it should be.

80
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:13,143
Speaker 1: It's still weird.

81
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:13,428
Speaker 0: Yeah.

82
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:21,149
Speaker 1: So, a long time ago on this show, we interviewed Taran Adams, who is the Dwarf Fortress guy.

83
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,155
Speaker 0: Oh, yes we did.

84
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:23,844
Speaker 0: You should go check out that interview.

85
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:24,890
Speaker 0: It was actually a really good interview.

86
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,535
Speaker 1: That was a very popular episode.

87
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:31,560
Speaker 1: I played Dwarf Fortress off and on just because- Derf Fortress.

88
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:32,330
Speaker 1: What?

89
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,376
Speaker 0: Derf Fortress.

90
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,002
Speaker 1: Okay.

91
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:34,950
Speaker 1: I'm a little tired.

92
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:35,658
Speaker 0: Tired?

93
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:36,049
Speaker 0: Yeah.

94
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:46,869
Speaker 0: You didn't ... I was making a call back to a conversation we had before the show that usually you would respond to with, you would've said something like, "Rune Baderge," and then we would've had an inside joke, but instead, nothing.

95
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:47,837
Speaker 1: Whatever.

96
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:48,730
Speaker 0: What's going on here?

97
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:54,637
Speaker 1: So, I haven't played it in a while, but now I have much faster computers and I'm feeling kind of maybe dwarfing again.

98
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:59,096
Speaker 1: And there's a dwarf game going on in our forums again, so it's like, "All right, let's

99
00:04:59,136 --> 00:04:59,638
Speaker 1: re-dwarf.".

100
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:09,620
Speaker 1: So this book came out very recently called Getting Started with Dwarf Fortress, a real book printed, published by O'Reilly, an actual book book for reals.

101
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,350
Speaker 1: You can get the e-book or the paper one.

102
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,410
Speaker 1: I have the paper edition.

103
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, not a sports page, not a magazine, not a website.

104
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:24,526
Speaker 1: This book is actually ... I mean, there is a Dwarf Fortress wiki, and you're probably saying, "Why would I buy this book when I can just go to the

105
00:05:24,586 --> 00:05:24,907
Speaker 1: wiki?".

106
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:29,430
Speaker 1: And in fact, the guy who wrote the book is a huge wiki contributor, so it's mostly the same stuff.

107
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,590
Speaker 1: Well, for some reason, looking in this book is just the way it's formatted and such.

108
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:40,670
Speaker 1: It's just been easier for me to re-dwarf with this book than compared to the wiki.

109
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,830
Speaker 0: Well, the same information is presented in an actually useful fashion.

110
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:50,410
Speaker 0: The wiki gets a little wanky in terms of wankery of people who are in the Dwarf Fortress.

111
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:51,452
Speaker 1: Yeah.

112
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:59,570
Speaker 1: So, you know, if you want to try some Dwarf Fortress, even if you are scared of it or whatever, this book can actually make it happen.

113
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,570
Speaker 0: Now, I don't think ... I think you should all read it, even if you don't want to play Dwarf Fortress, because then ...

114
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,110
Speaker 1: Not a bad idea.

115
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:11,390
Speaker 0: You will experience something that nerds today, I don't know if they experience it as much as we did in the pre-internet days.

116
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,530
Speaker 1: Oh, when we read, like, an NES play strategy guide without playing the NES game.

117
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,230
Speaker 0: Yes, you would get a strategy guide to a game that you would never own and vicariously experience the game through that strategy guide.

118
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,690
Speaker 1: I don't know if this will do that, but anyway.

119
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:33,055
Speaker 1: But this, if you're, you know, remotely considering Dwarf Fortress or if you're just, like, avoiding it because you're afraid, get the book, this book, Getting Started with Dwarf Fortress.

120
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,850
Speaker 1: It is a good, worthwhile book.

121
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,092
Speaker 1: You can follow the guy who wrote it on Twitter also, and he tweets about lots of Dwarf Fortress stuff.

122
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:42,650
Speaker 1: And, you know, you can ... this will make it not painful.

123
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,969
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about buying the book just to read, even though I have no intention of playing Dwarf Fortress again.

124
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,530
Speaker 1: At least play a little Dwarf Fortress.

125
00:06:49,670 --> 00:07:01,470
Speaker 0: I've played some Dwarf Fortress, and I did not ... I get it, but I don't have the patience or the energy for the interface for the parts that I care about.

126
00:07:01,997 --> 00:07:02,227
Speaker 1: Okay.

127
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:12,590
Speaker 0: The things that I'm most interested in have to do with, like, designing the layout of my city, which is cool, except it gets a little too fiddly for me personally.

128
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,249
Speaker 1: I'd like to play Minecraft instead if you want to do that.

129
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:21,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Minecraft sort of scratches a different edge, and I like, like, setting up patrols and, like, managing my army and stuff.

130
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,249
Speaker 0: But that part is, like, the worst.

131
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:27,570
Speaker 0: Scott's having trouble here.

132
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,650
Speaker 1: I'm having some troubles.

133
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:29,968
Speaker 1: So I got a geek bite.

134
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,850
Speaker 1: This book is A plus.

135
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:32,910
Speaker 0: It's a great book.

136
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:33,509
Speaker 1: A plus book.

137
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,687
Speaker 0: Every time I'm over at Scott's house, I'm just kind of reading it idly while we watch Running Man.

138
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:39,610
Speaker 0: So, I got a geek bite myself.

139
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:49,709
Speaker 0: You see, way back in the day, there was this thing called Venture Brothers, and Scott and I actually pretty much ignored it.

140
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:55,348
Speaker 1: It's so old that at the first Kineticon we ever went to, they were watching it on the TV in the staff room.

141
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,290
Speaker 0: No, no, that was not Kineticon.

142
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,330
Speaker 0: That was Katsucon.

143
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:00,850
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was Kineticon.

144
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,030
Speaker 0: Wait, what staff room in Kineticon are you talking about?

145
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,870
Speaker 1: When we went to go pick up the badges and they had itineraries, remember?

146
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,148
Speaker 1: And it was in that room with the conference room with the table and the TV at the far end of the table.

147
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:17,629
Speaker 0: I remember that layout for Katsucon where we also picked up an itinerary.

148
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,210
Speaker 1: I remember this at the first Kineticon that we went to ever.

149
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:25,350
Speaker 0: Okay, because I remember that from a Katsucon.

150
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,330
Speaker 0: Alright.

151
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:27,350
Speaker 0: Regardless.

152
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:39,448
Speaker 0: And I was like, you know what, I realized it was very popular, but at the same time, there were similar kinds of things, like Aqua Teen Hunger Force and those kinds of shows that I just never liked.

153
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:45,810
Speaker 0: I assume Venture Brothers was one of those because I watched a bunch of episodes in the middle and it didn't make any sense.

154
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,745
Speaker 1: Well, all I knew about it was that it was an Adult Swim kind of show.

155
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:56,970
Speaker 1: that was a Johnny Quest sort of parody and it might have been good or bad, but it didn't seem like it was so great.

156
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,108
Speaker 1: I had to run out and see it.

157
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,710
Speaker 1: So it was just way low on the list.

158
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,690
Speaker 0: So I would have ignored it, but it was too popular.

159
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,129
Speaker 0: I mean, I even remember a PAX.

160
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,109
Speaker 1: Is it really that popular?

161
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:05,518
Speaker 1: Yeah.

162
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:13,989
Speaker 0: Where we showed up to our panel room and, you know, like they'll, late at night, especially the enforcers in the rooms, if they don't have an ad they have to play, we'll just like play stuff.

163
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:20,589
Speaker 0: So they were playing like episodes of the Venture Brothers and there were hundreds of people in the room just hanging out watching that.

164
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:27,250
Speaker 0: And in fact, when we showed up, they're like, yeah, you guys always want to play stuff, but can we just keep playing Venture Brothers?

165
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,910
Speaker 0: But I knew it was really popular.

166
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:41,206
Speaker 0: I watched some episodes from some point in the show and I decided it was a stupid show that didn't go anywhere and had a lot of that kind of random family guy-esque sort of references and I gave up on it.

167
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:43,969
Speaker 0: That was a mistake on my part.

168
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:53,370
Speaker 0: When I went to India a while ago, which actually wasn't that long ago, I acquired by some means all of the existing seasons of Venture Brothers.

169
00:09:53,851 --> 00:10:05,349
Speaker 0: And I started watching it while I was in airports between flights and it was okay, wasn't great, but I was bored and I had nothing else to do.

170
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:15,570
Speaker 0: So even though I watched four episodes and decided it wasn't that good, I kept watching because my options were keep watching this or sit here doing nothing.

171
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:16,508
Speaker 1: You read a book?

172
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,588
Speaker 0: I already read the one book I had with me.

173
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,910
Speaker 1: Produce Unproductive on your computer?

174
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:23,590
Speaker 1: Make something?

175
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,090
Speaker 0: Like what?

176
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,930
Speaker 0: Back then I was not planning to make those two games I'm currently working on.

177
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:28,469
Speaker 0: In India?

178
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,129
Speaker 1: You knew it wasn't long ago.

179
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:31,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

180
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:33,570
Speaker 0: Now I'm working on those games, but anyway.

181
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:40,750
Speaker 0: So I watched more and more episodes and then I realized at some point, like eight or nine episodes in, that I actually fucking love that show.

182
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:51,710
Speaker 0: The Venture Brothers is, now that I've seen enough of it to see what the deal is, easily one of my favorite recent television shows, anime, American, live action, anything.

183
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:53,928
Speaker 0: It is right up there.

184
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,650
Speaker 0: It's like one hair under Archer and like a few feet under My Little Pony.

185
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:06,529
Speaker 0: It's a great show and if I need to sell you on it, I'll sell you on it for this.

186
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:16,930
Speaker 0: The show is really just a sort of treatment of what it would really be like if there were a family like the Johnny Quest family.

187
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:24,849
Speaker 0: More importantly, if Johnny Quest grew up and then had his own family and had the same kind of bullshit happen to his kids.

188
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,310
Speaker 0: I don't know how to describe it.

189
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:27,730
Speaker 0: It's great.

190
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,490
Speaker 0: It's callbacks.

191
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:29,630
Speaker 0: Everything about the show is great.

192
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,423
Speaker 0: You should all watch it.

193
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:39,066
Speaker 0: Just bear in mind that the first, I don't know, five or six episodes are not that funny and not actually that indicative of what the rest of the show is like.

194
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:42,984
Speaker 0: Kind of like a, what's the show, a Gao Gai Gar.

195
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,050
Speaker 1: Well, Gao Gai Gar is like, I haven't watched that, but I heard it's like 80 episodes are bad and then it's good.

196
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is like five episodes are lame and then it picks up.

197
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,629
Speaker 1: Can you just go to episode six then?

198
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

199
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:01,730
Speaker 0: The thing is, the reason I didn't get Venture Brothers the first time I saw it is that I watched random episodes in the middle.

200
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:08,587
Speaker 0: The show is serial to a degree that missing one episode means the next episode makes no sense.

201
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:19,990
Speaker 0: It's just a straight up contiguous plot, like stories, and some of those stories are disconnected, but it always picks up right after the awesome adventures.

202
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,270
Speaker 0: You never see the actual awesome adventure.

203
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,688
Speaker 0: You just see them coming home from the awesome adventure and then bullshit happens to them.

204
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:27,730
Speaker 1: Okay.

205
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:32,867
Speaker 0: Anyway, we're scraping the bottom of the barrel here on this Thursday, Scott's, uh, Scott's fading fast.

206
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,610
Speaker 1: I've faded already.

207
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:47,080
Speaker 0: So we'll get right into things of the day before Scott falls asleep.

208
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,840
Speaker 1: This thing of the day is too good to save for a Wednesday when it'd be more appropriate.

209
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,900
Speaker 1: So I'm letting it loose right now because I own your load early, right?

210
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:02,999
Speaker 1: So what this is, this is a, somebody made this video documentary interview with no care was Sawa.

211
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,100
Speaker 1: It's five parts on YouTube.

212
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:06,960
Speaker 1: So it's like almost an hour long.

213
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:09,320
Speaker 1: It is so amazing.

214
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,380
Speaker 1: Profile of a genius.

215
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:12,318
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

216
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,080
Speaker 1: You know, it's not a Wednesday show, you gotta watch this.

217
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,059
Speaker 0: So I don't think that many of the people listening right now know who, know he or Sawa is.

218
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,219
Speaker 1: Watch this thing and fucking find out.

219
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:22,560
Speaker 0: All right.

220
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,740
Speaker 0: Well, I'll literally say he's one of the greatest manga authors currently.

221
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,779
Speaker 1: Pretty much number two, might even be number two all time, period.

222
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,139
Speaker 0: Number two all time.

223
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:37,939
Speaker 1: Tezuka, Urasawa, who else are you going to put in there?

224
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,258
Speaker 1: Otomo?

225
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,719
Speaker 1: We only did Akira.

226
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,439
Speaker 1: That was the only thing that would level it.

227
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,840
Speaker 0: See, the thing is, I like, I really like sanctuary, but it's not on that level.

228
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,919
Speaker 1: I mean, but Shiro, Megona guy.

229
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Speaker 0: I really like Eagle.

230
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,320
Speaker 1: It's not, but that's not the greatest manga author of all time.

231
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,360
Speaker 0: No, but that manga is so good that it deserves consideration.

232
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's Eisner award winning manga, but so is Urasawa.

233
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:03,640
Speaker 1: And are you really going to say the guy who did Eagle is better than Urasawa?

234
00:14:03,962 --> 00:14:04,378
Speaker 0: You never know.

235
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:14,040
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I'm very much a fan when people take a real music video and do their own interpretation of it and do it well.

236
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,380
Speaker 0: Like one of those, like reanimate it or animate it or refilm it or something.

237
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:25,078
Speaker 0: But I also independently really like music videos that are themselves animated and tell a story.

238
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,839
Speaker 0: So want it, need it, hold me is a music video.

239
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:29,860
Speaker 0: It's animated.

240
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,637
Speaker 0: It's pretty sad about a cat that gets hit by a car and a little girl who wants to bring it back from the dead.

241
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,439
Speaker 0: And someone reanimated this.

242
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,140
Speaker 0: And the reanimation is extremely well done.

243
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:53,320
Speaker 0: And more importantly, it's actually extremely clever because it tells an analogous story, but simultaneously it changes elements to make its own story make sense in and of itself.

244
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,660
Speaker 0: So you can watch the remake video and it makes perfect sense.

245
00:14:58,222 --> 00:14:59,220
Speaker 0: You can watch the original.

246
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:01,491
Speaker 0: It tells a different, similar story.

247
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:03,259
Speaker 0: that also makes perfect sense.

248
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:05,160
Speaker 1: You just couldn't stay away from ponies, could you?

249
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:08,837
Speaker 0: It happens to be a My Little Pony mashup.

250
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,179
Speaker 0: Scott, My Little Pony mashups constitute like 4% of all mashups at this point.

251
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:14,979
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

252
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,480
Speaker 1: It still leaves you with 96% of things to make things of the day.

253
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I look through my...

254
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,348
Speaker 1: And then you can make a thing of the day.

255
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:22,578
Speaker 1: that's not even a mashup, so...

256
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:23,480
Speaker 0: All right, Scott.

257
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:25,420
Speaker 0: So I'll go through my like stream.

258
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:25,818
Speaker 0: Let's see.

259
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:30,679
Speaker 1: You don't see me taking the easy way out, making it all Gagnam style things of the day.

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,140
Speaker 0: But this thing is really good.

261
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,919
Speaker 0: What have I liked?

262
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,940
Speaker 0: What have I added to my list of things that are worth watching recently?

263
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:44,940
Speaker 0: The Care Bears movie, the trailer to the Care Bears movie, the good ending to Catherine, a video I made.

264
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:47,680
Speaker 0: You would have given me shit if I made my own video.

265
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,420
Speaker 1: You can't make your own thing the thing of the day.

266
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,258
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do it then.

267
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,016
Speaker 1: That's not allowed.

268
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:51,740
Speaker 0: I'm doing it.

269
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:52,960
Speaker 1: It's not permitted.

270
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:56,320
Speaker 0: You want me to do cat regrets stepping into tub instead?

271
00:15:56,482 --> 00:15:57,058
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

272
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:58,540
Speaker 0: It is actually a really good video.

273
00:15:58,601 --> 00:15:59,053
Speaker 1: Let's watch it.

274
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:01,100
Speaker 1: We're watching it right now.

275
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,259
Speaker 0: This is great.

276
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,190
Speaker 0: This cat is like...

277
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,679
Speaker 1: All right, he's standing on the edge of a bathtub.

278
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,299
Speaker 1: What's going on?

279
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,840
Speaker 1: It looks like there's a little bit of water in there.

280
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,680
Speaker 0: There is a little bit of water.

281
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,119
Speaker 0: What's that?

282
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,533
Speaker 1: But not a lot.

283
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:11,879
Speaker 1: It's like an inch or two of water.

284
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:12,458
Speaker 1: I'm a cat?

285
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,620
Speaker 1: He's doing the catwalk on the edge of the tub.

286
00:16:14,962 --> 00:16:16,479
Speaker 0: I'm gonna reach my pod and see what's up.

287
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:17,399
Speaker 1: He's reaching in.

288
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:18,260
Speaker 0: Oh fuck, it's water.

289
00:16:18,863 --> 00:16:19,979
Speaker 0: Oh fuck, I can't get back out.

290
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:23,679
Speaker 1: He's got two arms in the tub, but the legs are still on the up.

291
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,540
Speaker 0: Oh fuck, I'm in the water.

292
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,820
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I can't get out of the tub.

293
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:27,039
Speaker 0: Oh Jesus fuck.

294
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:28,660
Speaker 1: He got out.

295
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:29,000
Speaker 0: The end.

296
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,219
Speaker 1: Okay, he freaked out because he fell all four parts into the tub.

297
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:37,379
Speaker 0: All right, I'll make that my thing of the day too.

298
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,359
Speaker 0: You know what we should do?

299
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,316
Speaker 0: Which one you liked more.

300
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:47,199
Speaker 1: We should do take YouTube videos like that and just commentate over them like we just did and then post them to YouTube as responses.

301
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,479
Speaker 0: That's also not a bad idea for another show.

302
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:51,117
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

303
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,317
Speaker 0: Do we do that before or after a POTI?

304
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:56,040
Speaker 1: I mean, we could just do that right now.

305
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,700
Speaker 1: Take five minutes.

306
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:57,457
Speaker 0: Or Project ST.

307
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,078
Speaker 1: That would take five minutes for us to do.

308
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,018
Speaker 0: But we just did it.

309
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:00,639
Speaker 1: I know.

310
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,620
Speaker 1: It took five minutes.

311
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,699
Speaker 0: I'll cut the audio out and I will do it.

312
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:05,739
Speaker 0: I will do it right after the show.

313
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,480
Speaker 0: So met a moment.

314
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,319
Speaker 0: I made a YouTube video that was a mashup of My Little Pony and Powerpuff Girls.

315
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,160
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play this game.

316
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:18,900
Speaker 1: I made a YouTube video on summer streets.

317
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,500
Speaker 1: I was biking up and down when they closed Park Avenue off to cars on set last Saturday.

318
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,460
Speaker 0: Interestingly, I do it again tomorrow.

319
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:27,319
Speaker 1: And I just put my GoPro on.

320
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:27,760
Speaker 1: Yeah.

321
00:17:28,142 --> 00:17:28,500
Speaker 1: Tomorrow.

322
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:28,998
Speaker 1: Saturday.

323
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:33,879
Speaker 1: I put my GoPro on and I went back and forth and back and forth and back and forth a whole bunch of times.

324
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:37,239
Speaker 1: And then I sped it up really fast and I timed it so that it takes it.

325
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,520
Speaker 1: The video is exactly as long as Rhythm and Police.

326
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:40,800
Speaker 1: And then I posted on YouTube.

327
00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:44,680
Speaker 0: So I woke up late because, well, I didn't wake up late.

328
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:52,200
Speaker 0: I flew in from Sao Paulo that morning, came home, promptly fell asleep for two hours.

329
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:53,660
Speaker 0: And then it was kind of late.

330
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,219
Speaker 0: Like you don't want to go to Summer Street near the end of it.

331
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:57,618
Speaker 1: What time was it when you woke up?

332
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:02,362
Speaker 0: When I could have gone to it, it was about 11.

333
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:03,420
Speaker 1: So it does go to one.

334
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,699
Speaker 1: So you would have had three hours worth, which is not well, I would have had two hours worth, which is still enough.

335
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,240
Speaker 1: But the late hours are when all the tourists and slow people are out.

336
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:14,905
Speaker 1: I go out there at 7 a.m.

337
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:20,800
Speaker 1: and there's nobody out there except you and the other like five early morning New York people.

338
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,259
Speaker 1: So you can go way fast and no one gets in your way.

339
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,200
Speaker 1: So around 10 o'clock, it fills up with slow people and kids and families.

340
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,500
Speaker 0: I'm thinking on Saturday, I'm going to rollerblade that shit.

341
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:32,760
Speaker 1: That's not a bad idea.

342
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,300
Speaker 1: I saw some blading.

343
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,100
Speaker 0: Because it's not that often I can rollerblade anywhere cool in New York City without sign.

344
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,700
Speaker 1: My strategy for Saturday this time is, of course, 7 a.m go out there, go back and forth, back and forth.

345
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:49,232
Speaker 1: And when it starts clogging up and approaching 10, I'm going to go into the park and go in a circle and circle because, you know, tourists won't be in there.

346
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:50,920
Speaker 1: that even at 10 so much.

347
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,017
Speaker 0: But what we did since I didn't do Summer Streets, we went biking later and we went to the Smorgas town.

348
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,339
Speaker 1: Smorgas town?

349
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:12,440
Speaker 0: Basically, every Saturday all through the summer, there is in near Williamsburg, like there is a city of not food trucks, but artisanal food stands.

350
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,296
Speaker 0: Okay.

351
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:14,319
Speaker 0: It's like a city.

352
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:15,360
Speaker 0: It's gigantic.

353
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,180
Speaker 0: And I had some Japanese tacos and some awesome Indian food.

354
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,058
Speaker 1: Japanese tacos.

355
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,320
Speaker 0: And a dosa.

356
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:27,180
Speaker 1: We need to make Jewish tacos because every other kind of taco has been made.

357
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,759
Speaker 0: So what, gefilte fish?

358
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,920
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to be gefilte fish, but that could be a choice.

359
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,980
Speaker 0: So what, lox and cream cheese?

360
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:32,900
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

361
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,324
Speaker 1: Yeah.

362
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:35,580
Speaker 1: It's been somewhere.

363
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,316
Speaker 0: I could eat that.

364
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,460
Speaker 1: Locket potato.

365
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,418
Speaker 1: Locket taco.

366
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:39,854
Speaker 1: A locket taco.

367
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:41,120
Speaker 0: Locket taco.

368
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,020
Speaker 0: That's a good name for it too.

369
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:42,658
Speaker 0: We got the name.

370
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:43,739
Speaker 1: That's a lot.

371
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:44,112
Speaker 1: Go.

372
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,318
Speaker 0: No, locket taco should be the name of the truck.

373
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,057
Speaker 1: Locket taco.

374
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:55,959
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, we are going to be at Pax Prime and Pax Dev.

375
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,178
Speaker 1: A he burrito.

376
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:04,060
Speaker 0: But Scott, I can't put cheese and meat in it.

377
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:05,200
Speaker 1: And it'd be all glockkosher.

378
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:08,697
Speaker 1: Anyway.

379
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,580
Speaker 1: We'll be in Williamsbury.

380
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,560
Speaker 1: There's plenty of hot seats around here.

381
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,000
Speaker 0: The meta moment.

382
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,480
Speaker 0: The book club book is The Man Who Was Thursday.

383
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,840
Speaker 0: The book is over a hundred years old.

384
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,580
Speaker 0: It's in the public domain.

385
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,278
Speaker 0: Just read it.

386
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:16,555
Speaker 1: Jesus.

387
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,155
Speaker 1: Jesus.

388
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,240
Speaker 1: And stop being pussies doing audiobooks.

389
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,859
Speaker 0: It's meta so we can talk about it.

390
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,160
Speaker 0: Okay use of audiobook.

391
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:26,280
Speaker 0: I have a long driving commute.

392
00:20:26,544 --> 00:20:27,519
Speaker 0: I can listen to a novel.

393
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,560
Speaker 0: Bad use of audiobook.

394
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,180
Speaker 0: I don't read words anymore.

395
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,078
Speaker 0: I just listen to them.

396
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:33,960
Speaker 1: Good use of audiobook.

397
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,257
Speaker 1: I can't see.

398
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,000
Speaker 1: My eyes were burned in a horrible accident or I was born blind or something.

399
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,997
Speaker 1: Or glaucoma.

400
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,060
Speaker 0: Bad use of audiobook.

401
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Speaker 0: We already talked about that.

402
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,240
Speaker 1: Bad use of audiobook.

403
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,038
Speaker 1: I'm illiterate.

404
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,508
Speaker 1: Okay.

405
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:52,480
Speaker 0: And don't forget all our other old book club books are on the website.

406
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,359
Speaker 0: In fact, we've done a ton of books.

407
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you're looking for a book to read and you haven't read every book club book, just go back, pick one, and then listen to the episode.

408
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,380
Speaker 1: It's not like the episode goes anywhere.

409
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:04,760
Speaker 1: It's a magical time limit.

410
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,617
Speaker 0: You might want to go back and do the Prince of Nothing ones because you realize sometime next year.

411
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,440
Speaker 1: Those are the most important geek nights.

412
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:10,762
Speaker 1: Those are.

413
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:13,500
Speaker 1: the official book of geek nights is the Prince of Nothing series.

414
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:14,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, those books.

415
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:15,939
Speaker 0: Goddamn.

416
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,440
Speaker 1: The same way the official games of geek nights are Counter-Strike, Tigris and Euphrates, Puerto Rico, and Natural Selection.

417
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:32,598
Speaker 0: So not only are we going to miss a bunch of episodes because we're going to Seattle for a whole week between Pax Dev and Pax Prime, but then Scott is going to DjangoCon right after that.

418
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:38,260
Speaker 0: Then I am going to Warsaw for a couple of weeks, most likely, and maybe Istanbul again.

419
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:42,039
Speaker 0: And independent of all that, Counter-Strike GO is coming out.

420
00:21:43,742 --> 00:21:48,418
Speaker 1: Oh, and then by the time shit's done there, it's going to be like Halloween, Thanksgiving, holiday, New Year's.

421
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:50,379
Speaker 1: MagFest is next year.

422
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,139
Speaker 0: MagFest is right after New Year's.

423
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:52,513
Speaker 1: I know.

424
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:53,538
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

425
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:54,173
Speaker 1: Okay.

426
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:55,140
Speaker 0: Yeah.

427
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:58,740
Speaker 0: But yeah, Book Club book stuff, panels at conventions.

428
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:02,560
Speaker 0: We have a Twitter, our videos are on our website.

429
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,438
Speaker 1: We have a mailing list.

430
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,700
Speaker 0: The mailing list has unique exclusive content that you won't get anywhere else.

431
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:09,479
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

432
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,936
Speaker 1: I have like, because I bought a new computer and stuff, I have a bunch of stuff I'm going to get rid of.

433
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:19,838
Speaker 1: So I'm going to make a post somewhere that like, you know, has pictures and descriptions of all the stuff I'm trying to get rid of.

434
00:22:20,483 --> 00:22:22,360
Speaker 1: And if you want some of it, you had to pay me money.

435
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:25,360
Speaker 1: Some of it, I'll be happy to just someone take it away out of my house.

436
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:25,940
Speaker 0: I'll play that game.

437
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,499
Speaker 0: Anyone want a broken blender?

438
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:30,720
Speaker 1: My stuff is actually good and useful.

439
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,654
Speaker 1: I just don't need it.

440
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:39,640
Speaker 1: So once I post that page, you can, you'll be able to find a link to it easily and can contact me if you want.

441
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,339
Speaker 1: A bunch of people have already expressed interest in the computer, so I got to come up with a fair price for it.

442
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:48,253
Speaker 1: It's old, so it's not worth that much, but it works really well and it's actually pretty good.

443
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,280
Speaker 1: So it's worth something.

444
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,678
Speaker 1: And I feel bad just giving it for free.

445
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:54,540
Speaker 0: Why would you feel bad giving things away for free?

446
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,999
Speaker 1: Well, I just feel bad giving away something really good for free.

447
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,160
Speaker 0: So you're just selfish.

448
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,580
Speaker 1: I have no problem giving it away mad cheap, just not absolutely free.

449
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:27,860
Speaker 0: So as you may recall, you know, we go to the Penny Arcade Expo every year and every year for many years, we would be amazed at people we knew or on the Internet who would say things like, ah, I wanted to go to Pax, but the badges sold out and now I can't go because the badges were on sale for many, many months.

450
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:28,319
Speaker 0: Yeah.

451
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:34,476
Speaker 0: All those people could have at any time just gone and bought badges, but they didn't put your basically tickets to get in, but they didn't.

452
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:40,640
Speaker 0: So I don't know if it's because we told people to do this for years or some unrelated thing happened that had nothing.

453
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,979
Speaker 1: I don't think it was our fault that we contributed, but I don't think we were the primary contributing maybe a handful.

454
00:23:48,002 --> 00:23:52,620
Speaker 0: But this year, Pax Prime sold out effectively immediately.

455
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,460
Speaker 1: Same as San Diego, same as all these other really, you know, popular concerts.

456
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,586
Speaker 0: It's like this one year.

457
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:02,740
Speaker 0: everyone in the world who wanted to go to Pax suddenly realized, wait a minute, I should just buy my badge right away.

458
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:03,600
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

459
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,060
Speaker 0: So now we have the problem of even right away doesn't guarantee you a spot.

460
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,460
Speaker 0: Just got to pay attention to the Internet's all the time now, because, for example, look at like Otacon, like the ticket to get the artist's alley table.

461
00:24:16,402 --> 00:24:20,900
Speaker 1: Well, the supply to demand ratio for that is even lower, right?

462
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,039
Speaker 1: You've got like a few hundred tables and a few thousand people want them.

463
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:24,420
Speaker 1: Yeah.

464
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:28,640
Speaker 1: So you got to fight like you got to beat up nine people to be in the top 10 percent.

465
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,820
Speaker 1: For Pax, maybe you got to be in the top 75 percent to get to that.

466
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:34,179
Speaker 0: I think it's worse than that.

467
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:36,900
Speaker 1: It's not as bad as Otacon artist's alley table.

468
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,599
Speaker 0: I think it's going to be worse than that next year.

469
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,509
Speaker 1: Oh, going to be.

470
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:41,179
Speaker 1: I just said is.

471
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,862
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

472
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:44,380
Speaker 0: This year it sold out in like an hour or two.

473
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,140
Speaker 0: But next year, I don't know what's going to happen.

474
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:57,860
Speaker 0: I don't know if they're going to do something cool to mitigate this, but if they do the same system they did last year, I predict that Pax Prime will sell out within 30 minutes of badges being announced.

475
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,243
Speaker 1: It'll sell out fast.

476
00:24:59,825 --> 00:25:05,540
Speaker 0: And I predict that Pax East will sell out within an hour of the badges being made available.

477
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,598
Speaker 1: It'll be really fast.

478
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:17,740
Speaker 0: And the scary part is that if it weren't for the fact that Scott and I have been guest speakers at every Pax we've ever attended, I wouldn't have even gotten to go to this Pax because I could not get a badge in time.

479
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,543
Speaker 1: I got one.

480
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:22,200
Speaker 0: I actually was going to buy one for a chance to be an omega knot.

481
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:24,316
Speaker 1: I also bought one for a chance to be an omega knot.

482
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:24,820
Speaker 1: and now I have a badge.

483
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:25,870
Speaker 0: I would have gone anyway.

484
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:26,539
Speaker 0: You know what I would have done?

485
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,506
Speaker 0: Enforced.

486
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

487
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,444
Speaker 0: That's what I would have done.

488
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:32,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not everything gives you that option, right?

489
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,143
Speaker 1: If there's some concert you want to go to and it sells out, you can't be like, hey, can I be a roadie?

490
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:42,100
Speaker 1: It's like, no, you know, unless you're a roadie, you can't just suddenly become one just to get into one concert.

491
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,205
Speaker 1: It doesn't work that way.

492
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:44,252
Speaker 0: So why did things like?

493
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,480
Speaker 0: why does Pax sell out so quickly?

494
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:49,980
Speaker 1: Because there's only limited supply and a great demand.

495
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,339
Speaker 0: So why is demand so high?

496
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,839
Speaker 1: Because Pax is awesome.

497
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,767
Speaker 0: So in a rational market, shouldn't we increase the price until demand is exactly equal to supply?

498
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:00,600
Speaker 1: That is true.

499
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,363
Speaker 1: We could do that.

500
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:08,760
Speaker 1: But the problem is they intentionally keep the price low to make sure that Pax is accessible to all because then it would be unfair.

501
00:26:08,982 --> 00:26:10,800
Speaker 1: Like only the richest nerds get to go to pass.

502
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,864
Speaker 0: Now you see you're answering my questions because this is in fact, I'm being very Socratic here.

503
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:15,267
Speaker 1: Yes.

504
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,559
Speaker 0: So all right.

505
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,880
Speaker 0: So to be altruistic and it's something I very much admire.

506
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:26,719
Speaker 0: Mike and Jerry, the gentleman behind Penny Arcade and Robert Koo, the secret mastermind vizier behind Penny Arcade.

507
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:28,432
Speaker 0: I trust their judgment.

508
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:29,319
Speaker 0: I respect them mightily.

509
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:36,402
Speaker 0: Their goal is to be altruistic and to not, you know, to drastically reduce the price they could sell.

510
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:42,779
Speaker 0: I believe they could sell Pax badges for several hundred dollars and still sell out and still have a lot of people who wanted to go but couldn't.

511
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,701
Speaker 1: It's possible.

512
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:55,839
Speaker 0: So by keeping the price low to be altruistic, they simultaneously guarantee that scalping, counterfeiting and immediate sellout will occur.

513
00:26:56,601 --> 00:27:04,288
Speaker 0: So this altruistic desire to keep the price low causes three individual undesirable outcomes.

514
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,440
Speaker 1: That is true, right?

515
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,960
Speaker 1: Scalping, because if people are willing to pay, you know, three hundred dollars to go to Pax, they want it that badly.

516
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,069
Speaker 1: Pax is that good.

517
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,199
Speaker 1: And they have that money.

518
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:23,019
Speaker 1: A scalper who is able to get a badge quickly can make a very large profit because the price of the actual badge is too low.

519
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:34,060
Speaker 0: Now, this is a tricky situation because the fundamental nature of scalping is not in and of itself immoral, in my opinion, because it is little more than arbitrage.

520
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,800
Speaker 0: There's a there's a scarce resource.

521
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,060
Speaker 0: So someone who has that resource then resells it for its current actual market value.

522
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:58,180
Speaker 0: However, now not for Pax, because you can't really get away with it, but for concerts and things, oftentimes there are scalper organizations that go out of their way to get enough tickets to introduce artificial scarcity themselves, thus becoming like DeBeers.

523
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:02,680
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, even if one guy buys one Pax badge and resells it for a higher price.

524
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,182
Speaker 1: Right.

525
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:05,260
Speaker 1: And the guy was willing to pay three hundred.

526
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,760
Speaker 1: So like, well, what's the moral problem?

527
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,620
Speaker 1: Well, it's like, well, it's bullshit.

528
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,380
Speaker 1: That dude had to pay three hundred.

529
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,340
Speaker 1: He could have just paid the original price.

530
00:28:13,722 --> 00:28:17,962
Speaker 0: And his only crime, you could argue that he couldn't have because of scarcity of supply.

531
00:28:18,022 --> 00:28:18,163
Speaker 1: Right.

532
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:22,602
Speaker 1: But his only crime was being slower at buying the badge than the scalper was.

533
00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:30,100
Speaker 1: So instead of so it's like because this guy was, you know, one guy is basically being rewarded with a bunch of money just for clicking quickly.

534
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:41,159
Speaker 1: And it's sort of, you know, it's kind of dirty, you know, and now this guy who actually wanted to go to Pax ended up spending more money that all went to the scalper and didn't go to Pax just so he could go.

535
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,619
Speaker 1: And it's like so it's not nice.

536
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,480
Speaker 0: But if no one scalped, the badges still sell out immediately.

537
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,044
Speaker 0: That's true.

538
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:48,660
Speaker 0: So that problem still occurs.

539
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:55,319
Speaker 1: But it would have been a guy, you know, just giving money to Pax and not having this scalper would not have basically leached off of some Pax goer.

540
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,352
Speaker 1: What if I go or the good person would have been able to?

541
00:28:58,412 --> 00:28:59,577
Speaker 0: what if I was a person?

542
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:00,722
Speaker 0: buy a badge?

543
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:04,943
Speaker 0: It's very difficult to buy a lot of badges and do the sort of traditional scalper thing.

544
00:29:04,963 --> 00:29:05,145
Speaker 0: Yeah.

545
00:29:05,387 --> 00:29:06,860
Speaker 0: So these are individual people to remember.

546
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,705
Speaker 0: Scott, you're forgetting.

547
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:09,720
Speaker 0: It's not three hundred dollars for nothing.

548
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,640
Speaker 0: The scalper himself has a Pax badge.

549
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:13,773
Speaker 0: He's giving up.

550
00:29:15,803 --> 00:29:17,759
Speaker 1: But that scalper is denied the bag.

551
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,905
Speaker 0: How do you know he didn't?

552
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:22,707
Speaker 0: How do you know that that obviously a Pax badge is worth three hundred dollars.

553
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:23,537
Speaker 0: The person who buys it.

554
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,971
Speaker 1: Well, he's selling it.

555
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:25,779
Speaker 1: He didn't want it.

556
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,120
Speaker 0: So what if it was worth two hundred ninety nine dollars to the person who was selling it, but not three hundred?

557
00:29:32,124 --> 00:29:33,179
Speaker 1: Oh, like you buy one.

558
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,299
Speaker 1: I would do what you want to go.

559
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:35,742
Speaker 1: Yeah.

560
00:29:35,782 --> 00:29:38,999
Speaker 0: But and I'm willing to pay five hundred dollars to go to a Pax.

561
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,180
Speaker 0: But you're not a badge for 40.

562
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,060
Speaker 0: Someone offers me a thousand dollars for my bag.

563
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:43,442
Speaker 1: Right.

564
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:44,819
Speaker 1: It's like you're not mega rich.

565
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:46,860
Speaker 1: So it's like you what you bought a Pax badge.

566
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,725
Speaker 1: You want to go.

567
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:50,480
Speaker 1: But someone offers like a thousand dollars.

568
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,720
Speaker 1: And it's like, well, a thousand dollars is a huge amount of money for me.

569
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:04,640
Speaker 1: I don't have that much, you know, and I really can't afford to give up a thousand dollars if it means, you know, the only other, you know, going to Pax.

570
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:07,080
Speaker 1: So I have to take the thousand because I need the money.

571
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,139
Speaker 0: I'm saying that the scalper himself is assuming risk that he might not be able to sell the badge, which is unlikely here.

572
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,364
Speaker 1: Very unlikely.

573
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:18,461
Speaker 0: But simultaneously he is giving up the valuable item in exchange for the money.

574
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:23,040
Speaker 0: And also now it means that the price discovery.

575
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:25,040
Speaker 0: I'm not necessarily saying I like it to happen.

576
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,420
Speaker 0: I'm just the arbitrage that happens.

577
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,019
Speaker 0: The price discovery that has occurred.

578
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:36,700
Speaker 0: What if there was a scalper or a group of scalpers who bought Pax badges, sold them at market prices and donated all of that money to Child's Play?

579
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:39,700
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, Penny Arcade could do it themselves, right?

580
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:39,961
Speaker 0: Yes.

581
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:49,659
Speaker 0: But then Penny Arcade themselves are directly going against their first principle, which was we will not make attendance in Pax deterministic upon one's wealth.

582
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:50,201
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

583
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:55,180
Speaker 1: They could do a lottery, but then that's even more unfair.

584
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,238
Speaker 0: Is it more unfair?

585
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:02,440
Speaker 0: Sort of because the fast clicking is effectively random and equally unfair.

586
00:31:06,162 --> 00:31:06,872
Speaker 1: Not exactly.

587
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:07,379
Speaker 0: How so?

588
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,060
Speaker 1: Well, because the thing is, if you don't have a lot of money, right, you know, because some people have money and some people don't.

589
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,491
Speaker 0: I see where you're going with this right now.

590
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,300
Speaker 1: This is what Penny Arcade says.

591
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:17,539
Speaker 1: But everyone has time.

592
00:31:18,163 --> 00:31:23,356
Speaker 0: No, the people who don't have a lot of money also don't have a lot of time because they're usually working all the time.

593
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,097
Speaker 1: But so they're working.

594
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,797
Speaker 0: So if you're poor and you're in a job, you can't just sit there holding down F5.

595
00:31:32,382 --> 00:31:34,419
Speaker 0: And thus, you're guaranteed to not get a badge.

596
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:43,858
Speaker 0: In fact, the people who are wealthier are now still more likely to get them because they have jobs where they can dick around on the Internet or they're idly wealthy and don't have any jobs.

597
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,401
Speaker 1: Possibly.

598
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:48,750
Speaker 1: So what do we do about that?

599
00:31:48,952 --> 00:31:50,530
Speaker 1: Well, is another question, right?

600
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:56,028
Speaker 1: You know, I understand the desire to want to allow someone who doesn't have that much money to go to PAX.

601
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:12,010
Speaker 1: But what comes down to is like, look, maybe if you live in Seattle, right, or near very nearby, the low badge price can make it, you know, so that a person who has relatively low financial funds are true can go.

602
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:22,335
Speaker 1: But if you don't live near there, even if the badge is cheap, the airplane in the hotel, if you're that poor, that you can't afford, say, one hundred dollar packs badge versus a fifty dollar one.

603
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:24,569
Speaker 1: And that's that fifty dollars makes the difference for you.

604
00:32:25,191 --> 00:32:29,130
Speaker 1: You probably can't afford to go there, period, with hotels and travel.

605
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:33,430
Speaker 1: So you probably shouldn't be going because it's not something you can afford.

606
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,401
Speaker 0: You just said that it is possible.

607
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,593
Speaker 0: there is a person who would want to go to PAX who shouldn't have.

608
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:46,730
Speaker 0: Yet your previous position was that if you want to go to PAX, it is worth all it is, except maybe there's someone who shouldn't spend all.

609
00:32:47,311 --> 00:32:48,076
Speaker 0: Give up all.

610
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:49,929
Speaker 1: Well, depends how much they're into it.

611
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:51,488
Speaker 0: You didn't give up everything to go.

612
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:52,638
Speaker 1: I did not.

613
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:53,850
Speaker 1: I was stupid.

614
00:32:55,051 --> 00:32:55,989
Speaker 1: If I could go back in time.

615
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,392
Speaker 0: All right.

616
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,129
Speaker 0: So they raised the badge price to one hundred dollars.

617
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:00,063
Speaker 0: Still sells out.

618
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:00,570
Speaker 0: Of course.

619
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,256
Speaker 0: Two hundred dollars.

620
00:33:01,276 --> 00:33:01,781
Speaker 0: Still sells out.

621
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:02,590
Speaker 0: Five hundred dollars.

622
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,469
Speaker 0: Now it's at the price of the plane tickets.

623
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:05,191
Speaker 1: Yeah.

624
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:12,470
Speaker 0: Maybe now it doesn't sell out, but now that five hundred dollars is a big deal even to people who are flying.

625
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:12,993
Speaker 1: That's true.

626
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,550
Speaker 1: You also can't have a situation where it doesn't sell out.

627
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:15,933
Speaker 1: Right.

628
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:18,110
Speaker 1: It's like you still want to sell every ticket.

629
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,590
Speaker 1: It's just you want to sell exactly all of them.

630
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,170
Speaker 1: You don't want to have even one per ideally obviously can't happen.

631
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,210
Speaker 0: So you could do something like a Dutch auction, but again, that rewards the wealthy.

632
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:31,910
Speaker 0: You could have a video game tournaments.

633
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:37,088
Speaker 1: That's not the only high skilled players would get to go unless the half.

634
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:39,267
Speaker 0: that unless it was like the megathon where half the games are B.S..

635
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,614
Speaker 1: Here's an idea.

636
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:45,030
Speaker 1: What if you said, all right, who's willing to pay the most for a PAX badge?

637
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,053
Speaker 1: and everyone bids and the highest guy after all the guys, you know how a Dutch auction works.

638
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:50,267
Speaker 0: But OK, anyway, go on.

639
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:50,993
Speaker 1: Right.

640
00:33:51,054 --> 00:33:53,049
Speaker 1: The highest bidder gets one badge.

641
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:53,754
Speaker 1: Right.

642
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,290
Speaker 1: Then that guy's out.

643
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,362
Speaker 1: He's not allowed to bid again.

644
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:56,970
Speaker 1: He's out.

645
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,120
Speaker 1: He doesn't get any more badges.

646
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,250
Speaker 1: He can't even bid one dollar.

647
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,364
Speaker 1: He can't bid a million dollars.

648
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:00,709
Speaker 1: He's done.

649
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:08,402
Speaker 1: Then you auction again and you keep auctioning each badge one at a time as the price keeps going down and down and down and down

650
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:18,710
Speaker 0: and every auction would serve the same purpose much better, though you would give up the discovery prices of, for example, people who are willing to play a ridiculous, inordinate amount of money.

651
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:26,570
Speaker 0: What you could do is something very complex, like Otakon's Artist Alley and Kineticon's Artist Alley have this huge problem.

652
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:30,889
Speaker 0: And Otakon ignored me for years as staff and I wanted to change it.

653
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:36,530
Speaker 0: I figured they should do have four allocations of Artist Alley tickets.

654
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:39,150
Speaker 0: And I feel like something like PAX could do the same thing.

655
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:46,449
Speaker 0: Maybe one quarter of the badges are a Dutch auction, one quarter or maybe the next.

656
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,810
Speaker 1: It'd be so complicated, though.

657
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:48,889
Speaker 1: People wouldn't understand it.

658
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:52,210
Speaker 1: So the education aspect would be so incredibly difficult.

659
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:56,408
Speaker 0: That'd be not necessarily because, look, you basically say what I'd have a site.

660
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:58,429
Speaker 0: What are you willing to spend?

661
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,228
Speaker 0: Money, time or luck?

662
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:03,389
Speaker 0: Money is Dutch auction.

663
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,730
Speaker 0: Time is first clicks and luck is the lottery.

664
00:35:08,112 --> 00:35:11,650
Speaker 1: Most people would just do time and clicks and then rich people do the auction.

665
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,829
Speaker 0: So maybe we're self-selecting toward people with better reading comprehension and understanding of statistics.

666
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.

667
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:23,690
Speaker 0: Because here's the huge difference between PAX and traditional tickets like a concert.

668
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:29,329
Speaker 0: I don't care who's in the seat next to me at a concert unless they vomit on me.

669
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:35,029
Speaker 0: But I do have a personal selfish interest in who is attending PAX.

670
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:42,348
Speaker 0: PAX is also a community and a long standing event as opposed to a concert, which I buy a ticket that I give up when I arrive.

671
00:35:42,711 --> 00:35:42,893
Speaker 1: Yep.

672
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,109
Speaker 0: Or maybe I keep a stub to prove that I was there.

673
00:35:45,672 --> 00:35:48,049
Speaker 0: And we have the fact that we're even talking about all of this.

674
00:35:48,552 --> 00:35:49,590
Speaker 0: PAX was just the example.

675
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:51,810
Speaker 0: All of these problems happen with everything.

676
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,230
Speaker 0: Justin Bieber concert.

677
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's talk about sports tickets.

678
00:35:56,051 --> 00:35:56,959
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

679
00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:58,070
Speaker 0: I sports tickets.

680
00:35:58,634 --> 00:35:59,445
Speaker 0: It is literally money.

681
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,609
Speaker 0: Money means you get to go.

682
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,309
Speaker 0: More money means you get a better seat.

683
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:03,691
Speaker 1: Yep.

684
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:11,209
Speaker 1: And the other thing is that the sports tickets had this other problem where they charge too much money so they don't sell out.

685
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:11,932
Speaker 1: Right.

686
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:14,644
Speaker 1: Because they can't really sell lower the prices.

687
00:36:14,664 --> 00:36:25,557
Speaker 1: because like let's say you're a season ticket holder and you buy sort of like a middle seat because it's somewhat affordable and you you know, you buy the whole season and you're sitting there and you didn't buy the more expensive seat.

688
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:32,190
Speaker 1: because, you know, that's a fancy seat down low, you know, right up on the field or arena or whatever it is, the ice will say hockey.

689
00:36:32,372 --> 00:36:32,594
Speaker 1: Right.

690
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,350
Speaker 1: So you buy the middle, you buy the mezzanine.

691
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:40,110
Speaker 1: You didn't buy up against the glass at half at center ice because why are you even there?

692
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,650
Speaker 1: But then what happens, the center ice ticket is so much money.

693
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,697
Speaker 1: Nobody buys it.

694
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,350
Speaker 1: So they lower the price.

695
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:48,175
Speaker 1: But then wait a minute.

696
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:51,071
Speaker 1: The guy who's sitting right behind that seat is like, hey, wait a minute.

697
00:36:51,313 --> 00:36:53,750
Speaker 1: The seat that's better than mine is now cheaper than I'm paying.

698
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,594
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

699
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:59,295
Speaker 1: So the seat stays empty rather than lower the price because another guy already paid more.

700
00:36:59,577 --> 00:37:02,659
Speaker 1: And then I get to give him his money back or let him have a free seat upgrade.

701
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,207
Speaker 1: Right.

702
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:09,250
Speaker 0: There's a whole science basically behind determining the prices of tickets to events.

703
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:14,929
Speaker 0: And it's a very dry and somewhat boring science with lots of math.

704
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,628
Speaker 0: But suffice it to say.

705
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:21,650
Speaker 0: I think we can all agree on one thing, fuck Ticketmaster.

706
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,910
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, here's the thing, Ticketmaster and all those guys.

707
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:29,130
Speaker 0: There's no reason, in my opinion, for a lot of these kinds of ticket services to exist.

708
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,337
Speaker 1: Well, here's why they exist.

709
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:30,518
Speaker 1: Right.

710
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:42,790
Speaker 1: So let's say you have a venue of some sort, a convention center, an arena, a concert hall, anything like that, any place with seats or space, even, you know, an outdoor festival.

711
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:43,292
Speaker 1: Right.

712
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:43,875
Speaker 1: And you have.

713
00:37:43,915 --> 00:37:47,989
Speaker 1: you have some limited number of things you can sell, even if they're just general admission tickets.

714
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:53,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's the logistics of selling the tickets, you know, is something you have to handle.

715
00:37:54,052 --> 00:38:00,530
Speaker 1: You need the system of to scan the barcode on the ticket when the person arrives to make sure it's legit, to make sure the same ticket wasn't used twice.

716
00:38:00,872 --> 00:38:05,218
Speaker 1: You need to make sure if you have seats, you need to make sure that like, oh, that person bought that seat.

717
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:06,510
Speaker 1: Don't sell that seat again.

718
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:08,089
Speaker 1: Someone already sitting there.

719
00:38:08,432 --> 00:38:10,690
Speaker 1: You know, there's this whole inventory management.

720
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:13,570
Speaker 1: If you have events over different days, you know what?

721
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,970
Speaker 1: And it's all these weird situations that happen.

722
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,852
Speaker 1: This is why if you go to any sporting arena, they have a ticket office with ticket agents.

723
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:34,910
Speaker 1: And it's like a whole department just handling tickets because weird chicken happen like, oh, you went to the game and it was rained out, which means your ticket now can be turned into a free ticket of equal or lesser value at any future game.

724
00:38:35,551 --> 00:38:41,050
Speaker 1: Or, you know, you bought a ticket with ticket insurance and something happened.

725
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:46,514
Speaker 1: So you weren't able to go and you cash in your ticket insurance to get money or another ticket.

726
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:48,450
Speaker 1: or you buy a ticket.

727
00:38:48,772 --> 00:38:50,709
Speaker 1: You can't refund it.

728
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:51,194
Speaker 1: Right.

729
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:52,750
Speaker 1: Because you're not allowed to get a refund.

730
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:53,734
Speaker 1: That's not allowed.

731
00:38:54,136 --> 00:38:57,973
Speaker 1: But you want to sell it legally and you could just sell it on StubHub or something.

732
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:01,470
Speaker 1: But another thing a lot of places offer is like consignment.

733
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,630
Speaker 1: So like you give I buy a ticket to a sporting event.

734
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:06,589
Speaker 1: I give the ticket back to them.

735
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:10,570
Speaker 1: Then they sell the ticket like it's a new ticket.

736
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:16,330
Speaker 1: And then I get some of the money from them selling the ticket because they basically sell it for me on consign.

737
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,430
Speaker 1: There's all these crazy weird things that happen.

738
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:20,749
Speaker 1: So you're a venue.

739
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,970
Speaker 1: All this crazy weird shit could happen and you need a system to deal with that.

740
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,490
Speaker 1: Are you going to roll your own system?

741
00:39:26,851 --> 00:39:27,797
Speaker 0: I don't know.

742
00:39:27,817 --> 00:39:30,030
Speaker 0: So there could be more competition.

743
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:35,230
Speaker 0: There's very little competition for Ticketmaster and they've been sued for antitrust stuff a lot.

744
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:35,992
Speaker 0: Yeah.

745
00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:47,690
Speaker 0: And there are a lot of venues that basically have agreements with Ticketmaster where if I'm a band and I'm performing this venue, I have to use Ticketmaster, even if there is an equally valid competitor.

746
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:47,931
Speaker 1: Right.

747
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:53,609
Speaker 1: So that's the thing is you're sitting there and you are a venue and you need someone you need some system to handle this.

748
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,230
Speaker 1: So Ticketmaster says, hey, we'll handle that shit.

749
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,890
Speaker 1: Sign this contract where you agree to all this crazy nonsense.

750
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:04,390
Speaker 1: And it's pretty much your choice to sign that contract or go find something else.

751
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,180
Speaker 1: But if you find something else, because other people have signed agreements with Ticketmaster.

752
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:09,810
Speaker 1: Right.

753
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:19,132
Speaker 1: And because, you know, of all kinds of other reasons of, you know, other systems don't have as many customers, so are going to have problems that Ticketmaster has mostly solved.

754
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:31,469
Speaker 1: Even though Ticketmaster also has problems, you pretty much sort of have to go with them or someone else evil, maybe telecharge or, you know, you have to go with one of the big evil guys and now they're handling all this stuff for you.

755
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:33,269
Speaker 1: So what's the problem with that?

756
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,644
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is the way Ticketmaster makes money.

757
00:40:36,664 --> 00:40:39,050
Speaker 1: is they don't make money from like you, the venue.

758
00:40:39,431 --> 00:40:39,713
Speaker 1: Right.

759
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:42,110
Speaker 1: You just sign a contract with them that you're exclusive with them.

760
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,870
Speaker 1: They make money because, OK, I have a concert hall.

761
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:45,815
Speaker 1: Someone has a concert.

762
00:40:46,137 --> 00:40:48,250
Speaker 1: Someone walks up to the concert hall and buys a ticket.

763
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:49,749
Speaker 1: OK, well, I have Ticketmaster machines.

764
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:54,729
Speaker 1: They gave me the machines, print out the tickets and I give them to people and we sell them for the cover price.

765
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:56,024
Speaker 1: You know, that's written on the ticket.

766
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:56,510
Speaker 1: No problem.

767
00:40:57,111 --> 00:41:08,869
Speaker 1: But if someone goes to Ticketmaster.com or calls Ticketmaster on the phone to buy a ticket, then Ticketmaster adds like 30 percent ridiculous service charge and the person buying the ticket has to pay that.

768
00:41:09,212 --> 00:41:11,309
Speaker 1: And that's where all Ticketmaster's money comes from.

769
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:12,450
Speaker 1: And without Ticketmaster.

770
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:19,130
Speaker 0: That and there are lawsuit allegations of things like taking allocations of tickets and diverting them to scalpers and other websites.

771
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:35,530
Speaker 1: But I mean, without Ticketmaster, then everyone who wants to buy a ticket would have to call the our box office directly and our box office to set up an e-commerce system that handles inventory and people clicking like crazy to try to get tickets.

772
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:41,153
Speaker 1: You know, when the thing goes online and, you know, someone click, they want to buy the tickets.

773
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:51,113
Speaker 1: It's a complicated system you have to set up and not every box, a box office of a thousand seat theater is not capable of setting this up for themselves to work independently.

774
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:59,750
Speaker 1: And also, you know, you lose actually some sales because how many people come to the Scott's Arena website to look for tickets to things?

775
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,071
Speaker 1: Right.

776
00:42:00,152 --> 00:42:01,618
Speaker 1: No, someone might be.

777
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,515
Speaker 1: there are people out there who are thinking, I do I live in New York.

778
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:05,490
Speaker 1: I want to go to a concert.

779
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,915
Speaker 1: What's going on?

780
00:42:06,955 --> 00:42:16,549
Speaker 1: And they go to Ticketmaster because it has all the concerts in town, whereas they're not going to go to every different website for every different arena in town to figure out what concert to go to.

781
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:32,129
Speaker 0: So apparently not that long ago, the president of Ticketmaster appeared on NPR for an interview or something and basically said that he is begging legislators to make the selling of tickets from person to person illegal in a general sense.

782
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:32,670
Speaker 1: Yep.

783
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:36,090
Speaker 0: Except through Ticketmaster's own product.

784
00:42:36,391 --> 00:42:47,610
Speaker 0: And he's basically went on to talk about how this would otherwise ruin the industry and ruin the economy and all this kind of B.S There was actually a couple of years ago, New York State, I don't think it happened.

785
00:42:48,091 --> 00:42:48,352
Speaker 1: Right.

786
00:42:48,613 --> 00:42:50,662
Speaker 1: They were actually going to pass a good law.

787
00:42:50,923 --> 00:42:51,867
Speaker 1: that almost happened.

788
00:42:52,188 --> 00:42:56,690
Speaker 1: that would have basically said you can't just add crazy service charges to ticket sales.

789
00:42:57,252 --> 00:42:59,990
Speaker 1: You know, you're selling a ticket to sell it for the price of the ticket.

790
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,257
Speaker 1: You can't just be like, oh, I'm just going to 30 percent of that, you know, because I'm selling it on the Internet.

791
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:07,949
Speaker 1: They were going to outlaw that, which would have basically yeah, ruined Ticketmaster.

792
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,270
Speaker 1: It would be the opposite of a Ticketmaster guy wanted.

793
00:43:11,372 --> 00:43:14,270
Speaker 1: And it would have been really great for the actual venues and such.

794
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:20,870
Speaker 1: But then what would have happened is Ticketmaster and those kinds of people would have pulled out of those venues, you know, because why service them?

795
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,369
Speaker 1: You're not making any money helping them out.

796
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:28,770
Speaker 1: And then they would have all been sort of in the water looking for someone to help them sell tickets and manage inventory and all that nonsense.

797
00:43:29,092 --> 00:43:29,275
Speaker 0: Wow.

798
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,490
Speaker 0: They're even trying to overturn.

799
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:32,129
Speaker 0: I'm on the Wikipedia page now.

800
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:39,330
Speaker 0: If you couldn't tell their Ticketmaster in Canada is trying to overturn some anti scalping laws so that they can then scalp tickets.

801
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:40,136
Speaker 1: Yeah.

802
00:43:40,176 --> 00:43:41,370
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, this is another thing.

803
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:41,591
Speaker 1: Right.

804
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:45,970
Speaker 1: Look at like over in, you know, Broadway is that TKTS line.

805
00:43:46,111 --> 00:43:46,293
Speaker 1: Right.

806
00:43:46,313 --> 00:43:48,390
Speaker 1: You know what that's all about is you're a theater.

807
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,470
Speaker 1: You know, you're the ticket manager and your show isn't wicked.

808
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:52,499
Speaker 1: It's not Book of Mormon.

809
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,549
Speaker 1: So it's not sold out.

810
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:54,716
Speaker 1: You know, it's not Pax.

811
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,590
Speaker 1: So you got a bunch of leftover tickets.

812
00:43:57,151 --> 00:44:02,710
Speaker 1: Well, you'd really like to make some money, but nobody wants them, at least not at the price you're selling or the Ticketmaster price.

813
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:09,810
Speaker 1: So you take a bunch of tickets and you go to TKTS, you say, hey, TKTS, I'll sell you these tickets in a big bundle for like a huge discount.

814
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:10,359
Speaker 1: And they say, OK.

815
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:15,172
Speaker 1: And then tourists line up at TKTS because they're certainly not lining up at the theater.

816
00:44:15,535 --> 00:44:15,656
Speaker 1: Right.

817
00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:19,929
Speaker 1: Because if you line up at the theater, the only show you can get tickets for is that show and you're going to pay full price.

818
00:44:20,531 --> 00:44:25,615
Speaker 1: So you line up at TKTS and there's a whole bunch of shows to choose from all the shows that didn't sell out.

819
00:44:25,856 --> 00:44:29,530
Speaker 1: So you can actually sort of, you know, wait in one line and get your choice, which is really convenient.

820
00:44:30,231 --> 00:44:39,289
Speaker 1: And then the ticket's going to be like half off because TKTS bought it at a discount and they're only adding a little bit to the discounted price, which is going to be lower than the full price.

821
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:45,133
Speaker 1: So, you know, when something is not selling well, there's these sort of like self scalping.

822
00:44:45,494 --> 00:44:50,435
Speaker 1: It's not really scalping because you're not charging more and it's being sold legitimately.

823
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:54,929
Speaker 1: But it's sort of like, shit, I'm the legitimate holder of these tickets and no one wants to go.

824
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,057
Speaker 1: I better I got to dump them.

825
00:44:56,499 --> 00:44:58,149
Speaker 1: And, you know, that kind of thing happens.

826
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:09,690
Speaker 1: The actually scalping usually happens when you can't, you know, all the tickets are out and then, you know, some of them are going to see when they're out, either naturally because the price was too low.

827
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:27,134
Speaker 0: Remember, oh, when a scalper bought them all, scalping can only happen if the price is too low for an event relative to what the market will bear or the supplies, the artificially constricted or the activities of the scalpers or actually legitimately constrict.

828
00:45:27,175 --> 00:45:29,749
Speaker 0: No, if they're constricted, that means that the price was too low.

829
00:45:30,712 --> 00:45:33,890
Speaker 0: And it's also no, there is no they're not there.

830
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:42,989
Speaker 1: There are some times where a crazy famous person will play in a small venue and no matter how high you set the price, right, you know, there is a price you could set.

831
00:45:43,912 --> 00:45:48,684
Speaker 1: But there is sometimes it's like, you know, I guess if you raise like, you know, yeah, a million dollars a seat for the 14 seats.

832
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:53,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not going to be 14 seats, but could be very few places.

833
00:45:54,754 --> 00:46:05,229
Speaker 0: Granted, you know, on the other side of that scale, like I went to that concert with Chase a while ago that was actually in a bootleg illegal club where I gave them cash at the door and they stamped my hand with a blob of black ink.

834
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:05,814
Speaker 1: Nice.

835
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:07,210
Speaker 0: That was my ticket.

836
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:07,672
Speaker 1: Nice.

837
00:46:08,396 --> 00:46:14,529
Speaker 0: When we walked out, you know, people were like hanging out in front of the venue and the guys like, you guys can't stand in front of the venue.

838
00:46:15,972 --> 00:46:16,233
Speaker 0: I could.

839
00:46:16,293 --> 00:46:21,950
Speaker 0: clearly the implied set to follow up sentence was because otherwise the police will know I have an illegal club venue in my basement.

840
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:22,330
Speaker 0: Yep.

841
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,860
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that I mean, you know, ticketing?

842
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:33,340
Speaker 1: It's like it's one of those things that, you know, sort of everyone has to deal with at some point in their life and they don't think too much about it at all.

843
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:33,721
Speaker 1: Really.

844
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:33,902
Speaker 1: Yes.

845
00:46:33,942 --> 00:46:39,263
Speaker 0: Like there's this huge about this nerds, especially events like conventions.

846
00:46:39,604 --> 00:46:43,740
Speaker 0: Nerds complain that, you know, how do you mean it's sold out?

847
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:44,713
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

848
00:46:45,058 --> 00:46:45,200
Speaker 1: Yeah.

849
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,165
Speaker 1: It's like you realize.

850
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:52,420
Speaker 1: ticketing alone, you know, regardless of any other things that happen at the event is this vastly complex issue.

851
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:56,563
Speaker 1: You know, we haven't even really scratched the surface of all the things that go on with ticketing.

852
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:58,960
Speaker 1: You know, it's so crazy complex.

853
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,280
Speaker 1: How do you you know, are you going to allow reentry?

854
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:05,480
Speaker 1: Are you going to some, you know, handicapped access for those kind of things?

855
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,502
Speaker 0: Connecticut, you know, we run the panels and workshops, companies buying up, see our website.

856
00:47:10,723 --> 00:47:20,720
Speaker 0: The Connecticut website has an ability mostly for gaming events to for people who have already registered for the convention to reserve a slot in an event ahead of time for a five person D&D event.

857
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,379
Speaker 0: That's fine for a panel room that seats a thousand people.

858
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:37,440
Speaker 0: Can you add the logistics of our department dealing with people registering ahead of time for the events would require it like us to quintuple our staff?

859
00:47:37,682 --> 00:47:37,884
Speaker 1: Yeah.

860
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:39,320
Speaker 1: Wasn't I going to do that ever?

861
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,799
Speaker 0: I will if we can do our staff.

862
00:47:41,121 --> 00:47:41,302
Speaker 1: No.

863
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:44,119
Speaker 1: Why would we want to do that, though, even if we had the staff to know lines?

864
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,380
Speaker 0: I guess no line ever, I guess.

865
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,220
Speaker 1: But then it would really reward first come first serve on the website anyway.

866
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

867
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,208
Speaker 0: And then you'd also have like ticketing alone is so vastly complicated.

868
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:55,604
Speaker 1: Right.

869
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:57,060
Speaker 1: And it's like you don't even think about it.

870
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:57,905
Speaker 1: You think, oh, it's simple.

871
00:47:57,925 --> 00:48:04,802
Speaker 1: You go to the box, you know, you pay money, you get a ticket, you go up to the door, the turnstile, you give the ticket, you walk in and that's all you think about.

872
00:48:05,043 --> 00:48:10,199
Speaker 0: Well, the in terms of, you know, the nerd care like Penny Arcade Expo selling out, SDC selling out.

873
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:11,364
Speaker 0: It is very simple.

874
00:48:11,926 --> 00:48:18,620
Speaker 0: If an event sold out and there were people who wanted tickets who couldn't get them, that event was underpriced.

875
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:28,799
Speaker 0: There is no other solution unless there is some sort of collusion to artificially restrict the supply and then a follow up scalping.

876
00:48:31,022 --> 00:48:31,304
Speaker 1: Anyway.

877
00:48:32,933 --> 00:48:34,280
Speaker 1: But yeah, ticketing is complicated.

878
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,569
Speaker 1: Don't think you know anything about ticketing?

879
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:40,186
Speaker 1: because I don't even know anything about ticketing.

880
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:42,000
Speaker 1: And I know I know more than the average person.

881
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,160
Speaker 0: Thus concludes the lowest energy episode of the nights in a while.

882
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:45,848
Speaker 1: In a while.

883
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:46,378
Speaker 1: It's all right.

884
00:48:47,182 --> 00:48:48,451
Speaker 1: We'll be back soon.

885
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:49,640
Speaker 1: Soonish next week.

886
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,706
Speaker 0: Next week, we got what?

887
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:52,680
Speaker 0: It's a Monday, Wednesday.

888
00:48:53,562 --> 00:48:53,804
Speaker 0: Great.

889
00:48:53,946 --> 00:48:55,500
Speaker 0: What do you want to do the show on on Monday?

890
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:57,467
Speaker 1: Something exciting.

891
00:48:57,669 --> 00:48:58,558
Speaker 0: You get Conrad on.

892
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,165
Speaker 1: Yeah.

893
00:49:00,225 --> 00:49:03,119
Speaker 0: If we get Conrad on, let's not talk about phones or laptops.

894
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,143
Speaker 1: Great.
