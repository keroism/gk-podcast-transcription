1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,187
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, January 20th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:10,408
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:13,719
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,449
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,160
Speaker 1: Tonight, Kings Forge.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,339
Speaker 0: We're Kings Forge things.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,040
Speaker 1: And it's kinda okay.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:21,700
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,312
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

10
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:32,540
Speaker 1: You know, a long time ago, Scott used to give me shit about how I didn't do Club Nintendo and how I just throw my Nintendo boxes away and I just didn't care.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,119
Speaker 0: Well, that was free codes for me, whatev.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,071
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean, it was free stuff.

13
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:37,400
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't you get the free stuff?

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,240
Speaker 1: Yes, because now, later, older, wiser, do you want a bunch of plastic stuff?

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,300
Speaker 0: Well, in those days, you know, that was the days where I was so foolish as to spend money on useless plastic stuff.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,180
Speaker 1: I used to have a lot of plastic useless stuff.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,718
Speaker 0: Also, Club Nintendo in Japan gave away awesome, worthwhile- Well, they gave away that, what, the NES controller?

18
00:00:56,738 --> 00:00:56,960
Speaker 1: at one time?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,420
Speaker 0: That was the best thing they ever gave away was an SNES controller, a Super Famicom controller, full, real controller, but it was 100% wireless and it worked with a Wii as opposed to with any other system.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,280
Speaker 1: I would have paid like 100 bucks for that.

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,980
Speaker 0: Well, you could pay like 70 bucks and get one.

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:23,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like when it came out- Right, but if you had enough Club Nintendo points, which at the time that this came out, this was like, you know, I definitely would have had the points to get it if it was offered in the US.

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,560
Speaker 1: Well, because apparently everyone had a ton of points all the time, but we'll get to that.

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:37,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, I bought, you know, between starting with the Game Boy Color, right, onward until the Wii, I bought a lot of Nintendo stuff.

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:47,780
Speaker 0: I bought the Game Boy Color when it came out, the DS when it came out, the GameCube when it came out, the Wii when it came out, and a lot of games, and I bought, you know, especially a lot of portable games, and those added up to a lot of points.

26
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:50,240
Speaker 0: But I didn't get shit for my points.

27
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,377
Speaker 0: I got like a calendar that I threw out and I got some washcloths I still use.

28
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:55,000
Speaker 0: Those aren't bad.

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, the thing is, the problem with any program like this is always that- Yeah, nowadays you can get some virtual console games.

30
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:03,780
Speaker 0: Well, not for much longer, though.

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:14,439
Speaker 1: Yep, but the problem with all those things is that usually the thing that, you know, savvy people who sign up and try to min-max these systems want is just more games for free.

32
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:16,939
Speaker 0: Yes, well, you can get that now, sort of.

33
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:25,480
Speaker 1: But in providing that with any real economy, you just undermine yourself by getting less money from your most dedicated fans.

34
00:02:25,784 --> 00:02:26,880
Speaker 1: They're gonna buy your shit anyway.

35
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:27,381
Speaker 1: Right.

36
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:44,399
Speaker 0: Well, you know, that's why even now they're giving away games for free, but they're like virtual console games and no one's gonna buy, you know, aren't worth paying real money for, so it's like, oh, I can- 'Cause even though I don't want- I'm not- I'm done ever falling for the pay for virtual console game ever again, 'cause I can just emulate that shit.

37
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:54,520
Speaker 0: But it is nice to have, like, I got Wario 2 for free from Club Nintendo, and having Wario 2 just officially on the 3DS is a lot more convenient than, like, getting out the piracy card.

38
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:55,400
Speaker 1: That is true.

39
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:58,920
Speaker 0: You know, but not worth paying for, but nice that I got it for free.

40
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,520
Speaker 0: It wouldn't get me to buy more games just to get that, but it makes me feel good about buying the games I already bought.

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:14,920
Speaker 1: So meanwhile, on the wide internet, I saw lots of reports, now when I was looking into Club Nintendo, when I saw the news I'm about to bring up, that, oh wow, this happened today.

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, today.

43
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:27,400
Speaker 1: So, that a lot of people had saved up codes or purchases to, like, maintain their status, and they were treating this like air miles, like they were really into it.

44
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:37,400
Speaker 0: 'Cause the way it works is, even though you can spend your points and any time to just get something, your coins, if you have enough coins within a certain amount of time, you set a status.

45
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,600
Speaker 0: Like, I used to be at the top status, but since the, you know, Wii U and the...

46
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:42,400
Speaker 1: All the way up to Rattata?

47
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:44,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, top status.

48
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:46,020
Speaker 0: I think top is platinum status.

49
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:57,500
Speaker 0: So I was at the top status for a while until the Wii sort of ended and the Wii U came out and didn't buy a Wii U, and I didn't buy that many 3DS games, and so since then, my status has gone down.

50
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,220
Speaker 1: I realized I've only bought eight 3DS games.

51
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:07,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're at the top status, there's, like, just stuff that you just get that you can't get any other way.

52
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,425
Speaker 1: So here's what I think happened.

53
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:12,600
Speaker 1: 'Cause Nintendo canceled the program, it's done, spend all your points, they're all gonna get deleted.

54
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:16,260
Speaker 1: If you care about this thing, you probably already know.

55
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,120
Speaker 1: So that's not the interesting part.

56
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,779
Speaker 1: But I feel like what happened here on a high level...

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,660
Speaker 0: They're replacing it with something else yet to be determined.

58
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:23,379
Speaker 0: They are.

59
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,004
Speaker 0: Maybe it'll be better.

60
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:29,620
Speaker 0: Maybe they're actually gonna do the right thing and offer the same awesome stuff to every country.

61
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,260
Speaker 0: Or fuck over every country, even Japan.

62
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,600
Speaker 1: So I saw... I read an article about this, like someone kind of explaining in more detail the context and the corporate whatevers and everything.

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:50,720
Speaker 1: And the one thing that the articles all seem to point out is that Nintendo seems to have done this in response to their profit scare, because, you know, recently Nintendo's not been doing well.

64
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:50,935
Speaker 1: No.

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,360
Speaker 1: And suddenly Nintendo changes a bunch of stuff when they're not doing well.

66
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,400
Speaker 1: Most of those changes involve shutting things down or backing away from things, but I digress on that.

67
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:13,759
Speaker 1: The first comment on two of these articles was a different person both saying the same thing effectively, "What if I buy a game between now and when the new program starts up, I better get my fucking

68
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:14,060
Speaker 1: points.".

69
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,559
Speaker 1: They were really, really, really worried about that.

70
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:28,600
Speaker 1: So as much as I want to say loyalty programs are stupid, obviously people care about them enough to dedicate life cycle resources toward them.

71
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:37,940
Speaker 0: The most evil thing about the Club Nintendo that I think is that you could... Basically, not only did you buy a game, type in the code, get stuff, but you could fill out surveys.

72
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,700
Speaker 0: So it's like you did surveys about any game you bought, but there are also other additional surveys.

73
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
Speaker 0: And taking these things, you got even more points.

74
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,840
Speaker 0: So it's really Nintendo is basically giving you stuff in exchange for market research for free.

75
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:57,720
Speaker 0: It's very similar to the grocery store card where you get discounts if you swipe the card and they track your purchases all the time.

76
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:02,720
Speaker 1: And the only reason they do that is because by law, they're not allowed to use your credit card number to track.

77
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:09,500
Speaker 1: So I wonder if you could theoretically get away by using face recognition or fingerprint or something.

78
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:12,098
Speaker 1: Anyway, I digress there again too.

79
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:23,920
Speaker 1: So what I suspect happened really here is that Club Nintendo was one of those things they did in Japan because that's what Japanese companies seem to do.

80
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:35,220
Speaker 1: It seems like a lot of these consumer rewards programs in the domestic market in Japan exist primarily because you're expected to have a program like that.

81
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,020
Speaker 1: You're expected to have this sort of deferential behavior toward your customer.

82
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,271
Speaker 0: From what I've seen, there's all sorts of stuff.

83
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:44,960
Speaker 0: In Japan, there's just lots of ways to get stuff.

84
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,660
Speaker 0: Especially, you buy a manga, you send in the surveys, you can get stuff for sending in the surveys.

85
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:51,646
Speaker 0: There's contests.

86
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,410
Speaker 0: you can just enter.

87
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:54,080
Speaker 0: Send in stuff, win contests.

88
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,080
Speaker 0: There's people giving out free tissues on the street.

89
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:02,818
Speaker 1: When I started picking up Japanese anime magazines and things in the old days just because, "Hey, pretty

90
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:03,340
Speaker 1: pictures!"

91
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:05,420
Speaker 1: I noticed all those things in there.

92
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's lots of ways to get stuff and they keep rewarding people with things.

93
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,849
Speaker 1: I wonder if there's a cultural difference.

94
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,376
Speaker 1: I don't know.

95
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:13,979
Speaker 1: I'm not Japanese.

96
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,380
Speaker 0: I mean, we have that culture here a little bit, but it seems like they have it a lot more.

97
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:27,340
Speaker 1: Well, I wonder if in Japan, the reason it wasn't a problem is that people, there was sort of this like, not everyone min-maxed it and went crazy on it.

98
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:38,020
Speaker 1: But I feel like in the US at least, the nerds I see who care about these kinds of programs care to an unhealthy degree and go way out of their way to maximize their haul.

99
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:40,980
Speaker 1: And I wonder if that wasn't the case in the domestic market.

100
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,020
Speaker 0: Well, there are kids who don't have a lot of stuff, so getting anything for free is amazing to them.

101
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:52,320
Speaker 0: These are the same people who are fighting tooth and nail for a t-shirt and hanging in the expo hall of PAX literally all day.

102
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,384
Speaker 1: Oh, you know what I should bring?

103
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:57,140
Speaker 1: Do you know how many Halo 4 t-shirts I have from PAXes?

104
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,040
Speaker 1: Because vendors will just give me shit, so I'm gonna bring it all with me and just give it away at our panel.

105
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,149
Speaker 0: Okay.

106
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,000
Speaker 0: Pay to fly your junk to San Antonio.

107
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:12,660
Speaker 1: I'm paying to fly stuff out anyway because I think Delta's gonna charge us for our checked bags.

108
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can just bring it to PAX East instead.

109
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:17,639
Speaker 1: It's the same hassle either way.

110
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,587
Speaker 0: Not necessarily.

111
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:19,240
Speaker 0: You can bring it to Connecticut.

112
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like I just want to get rid of it as quickly as possible.

113
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:24,724
Speaker 1: You know why?

114
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:37,279
Speaker 1: Because yesterday I was doing laundry because I got a bunch of... Right after PAX South I'm going on a ski trip, so I tried to get all my laundry done and set my life affairs in order likened unto what a dying man does.

115
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,730
Speaker 1: And I bumped into all those fucking shirts and I couldn't tell if they were clean or dirty or if they'd ever been washed.

116
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:50,540
Speaker 1: They were kind of wrinkly and I was like, "I don't want to fold them and put them somewhere and then forget about them again.

117
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,786
Speaker 1: I don't want to wash them.

118
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,118
Speaker 1: I'll just put them in my bag and take them to

119
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:54,339
Speaker 1: PAX.".

120
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:02,840
Speaker 1: So yeah, Club Nintendo's gone and I don't particularly personally care because I just threw away my game boxes.

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,100
Speaker 0: In other news, in the gaming lands, we talked a little while about GOG.com and the awesomeness of them bringing back the long lost TIE Fighter NX wing.

122
00:09:13,582 --> 00:09:15,609
Speaker 1: Oh my god, problems with that.

123
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:18,340
Speaker 1: We'll review those, I think, in depth later.

124
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,060
Speaker 1: But I do want to mention, if you did not buy TIE Fighter or X-Wing yet, here is my review.

125
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,686
Speaker 1: Do not buy X-Wing.

126
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:27,540
Speaker 1: It is just the prototype for TIE Fighter and it actually kind of sucks.

127
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:32,440
Speaker 1: Do not buy the later release of TIE Fighter.

128
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,863
Speaker 0: Well, you don't.

129
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:33,446
Speaker 0: You get them both.

130
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:35,460
Speaker 0: There's no separation between the purchase.

131
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Speaker 1: You could buy them separately, I'm pretty sure.

132
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,260
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you buy them both together.

133
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,519
Speaker 1: I think you bought them in that pack.

134
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:41,009
Speaker 0: It's just TIE Fighter.

135
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:42,178
Speaker 0: I don't think they offer like...

136
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,840
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure you can buy the two editions separately.

137
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,620
Speaker 0: No, it's ten bucks and you get TIE Fighter.

138
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:50,014
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, there we go.

139
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:52,630
Speaker 1: I didn't remember because I just bought it and it was a while ago.

140
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,170
Speaker 0: It's ten bucks and you just get everything.

141
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,950
Speaker 1: Special edition and TIE Fighter are separate listed here.

142
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:01,670
Speaker 0: I paid ten bucks and I got both.

143
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,595
Speaker 1: I'm trying to navigate this side.

144
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:07,403
Speaker 1: Anyway, there is a 1994 edition and a 1998 edition.

145
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:14,750
Speaker 1: The 1998 edition is garbage and you should never play it.

146
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,730
Speaker 1: The actual good edition is the 1995 edition that they did not re-release.

147
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,009
Speaker 1: There is no way to get that edition.

148
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,030
Speaker 1: I guess you could pirate it and run it in DOSBox yourself.

149
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,479
Speaker 1: That might be better.

150
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,589
Speaker 1: So, here's the differences.

151
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:35,749
Speaker 1: The '94 edition did something that games did not do well again until Tribes II.

152
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,975
Speaker 1: It had dynamic music.

153
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:44,670
Speaker 1: It had scarily dynamic, widely divergent music because it was all mini.

154
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:48,910
Speaker 1: So, when a missile was homing in, the music would get more intense.

155
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:51,110
Speaker 1: When there's fighters around you, the music would change.

156
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:56,050
Speaker 1: It would play like little riffs and motifs like when you take something out and the goal is completed.

157
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,610
Speaker 0: The other one has a Redbook CD track and it just plays it.

158
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, '98 just plays really bad music pretty much constantly and never varies it.

159
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,250
Speaker 1: That alone is a reason to never play the new edition.

160
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,690
Speaker 1: The new edition uses a different flight model which just isn't as good and not as fun.

161
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:19,770
Speaker 1: It has these ugly textures in it and I guess they lost the original assets when they made that re-release because all the game menus and everything just look like shit.

162
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,550
Speaker 1: And all the cutscenes, the sound quality is bad and the aspect ratio is wrong.

163
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,980
Speaker 1: So, just play the original '94 edition or pirate the '95 CD edition.

164
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:33,801
Speaker 1: The only difference between '94 and '95 is that '94 is partially voice acted.

165
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:40,550
Speaker 1: '95, every single word has amazing voice acting.

166
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:42,750
Speaker 1: Every mission briefing, everything.

167
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:44,477
Speaker 1: And the '95 edition is 640x480 instead of 320x200.

168
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,048
Speaker 1: That's nice.

169
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,110
Speaker 0: So, GOG.com followed that up today by releasing six more Star Wars games.

170
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:55,410
Speaker 0: GOG.com Wave 2.

171
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:01,370
Speaker 0: Star Wars Battlefront 2, which I think is a game where you're like a storm trooper and you walk around hitting things.

172
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, never played that.

173
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,787
Speaker 0: I think that's what it is.

174
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,193
Speaker 0: I don't know.

175
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like screw that game.

176
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:07,870
Speaker 0: There's no point in playing that.

177
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,151
Speaker 0: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2.

178
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:13,910
Speaker 0: People really fucking love Knights of the Old Republic a lot.

179
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:17,689
Speaker 0: I haven't played the second one, but I tried to play the first one.

180
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:19,529
Speaker 0: It is not good.

181
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,189
Speaker 1: I concur.

182
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:29,170
Speaker 0: It is a bad RPG that takes way too long to play and is completely uninteresting.

183
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:33,109
Speaker 0: I don't understand why these games are so ridiculous popular.

184
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:35,358
Speaker 0: I mean, whatevs.

185
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,590
Speaker 0: Star Wars Dark Forces, which is not that interesting because it's been on Steam for a long time.

186
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,789
Speaker 0: I have all those games on Steam.

187
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,150
Speaker 0: And those games are basically Doom, but Star Wars?

188
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:48,487
Speaker 0: And they're actually kind of fun.

189
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're okay.

190
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:52,306
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, you know, you're a stormtrooper, right?

191
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,630
Speaker 0: But it's like Doom, FPS style.

192
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,009
Speaker 0: Maybe a little bit better than Doom.

193
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,250
Speaker 0: Star Wars Galactic Battleground Saga, I think is an RTS.

194
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:02,547
Speaker 0: Who cares?

195
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,296
Speaker 0: And X-Wing vs.

196
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:08,070
Speaker 0: TIE Fighter, X-Wing Alliance, the two missing pieces.

197
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,674
Speaker 1: So X-Wing vs.

198
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:13,370
Speaker 1: TIE Fighter was a noble experiment, but it was awful and unplayable.

199
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,089
Speaker 0: So when it came out, it was like, holy shit, are you kidding me?

200
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:18,750
Speaker 0: We had X-Wing, we had TIE Fighter.

201
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:22,303
Speaker 0: Now, finally, multiplayer, X-Wing vs.

202
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,070
Speaker 0: TIE Fighter, holy crap.

203
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,173
Speaker 1: X-Wing vs.

204
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:30,349
Speaker 1: TIE Fighter came out three or four years after TIE Fighter came out.

205
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,098
Speaker 0: I think it was '98 or '99.

206
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,154
Speaker 1: It was '97.

207
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:33,301
Speaker 0: It was '97?

208
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:34,162
Speaker 1: It was X-Wing vs.

209
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:34,549
Speaker 1: TIE Fighter.

210
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:35,734
Speaker 0: Yeah, '97.

211
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:43,368
Speaker 1: When X-Wing first came out in '93, the first thing every nerd thought was, "Oh my god, I just want to play this with another human

212
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:43,590
Speaker 1: being.".

213
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:43,903
Speaker 0: Yes.

214
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,297
Speaker 1: And then X-Wing vs.

215
00:13:45,337 --> 00:13:47,070
Speaker 1: TIE Fighter came out and was a disaster.

216
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:48,428
Speaker 1: Just didn't work.

217
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:50,625
Speaker 1: X-Wing Alliance...

218
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,053
Speaker 0: '99.

219
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,766
Speaker 1: Yes.

220
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,416
Speaker 1: It was '99.

221
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,667
Speaker 1: X-Wing Alliance is way better than X-Wing vs.

222
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:56,110
Speaker 1: TIE Fighter.

223
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,526
Speaker 1: It's twice as fast as X-Wing and TIE Fighter and has a new flight model.

224
00:14:00,546 --> 00:14:01,430
Speaker 1: that's actually pretty good.

225
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:03,550
Speaker 1: And has a really good story mode.

226
00:14:03,952 --> 00:14:06,290
Speaker 1: It was a great game and I really, really liked it as a kid.

227
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:08,210
Speaker 0: X-Wing Alliance.

228
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,640
Speaker 1: Yeah.

229
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:11,341
Speaker 1: X-Wing Alliance also had multiplayer.

230
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:13,109
Speaker 1: that I guess worked, but...

231
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:25,950
Speaker 0: Was the best multiplayer, but apparently it is not offered according... At least if you go to G.com and click on X-Wing Alliance and scroll down to the specs where it talks about the game, it says single player.

232
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,350
Speaker 0: It does not say multiplayer.

233
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:30,048
Speaker 0: So I assume that means... See, right there.

234
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:30,446
Speaker 0: Modes.

235
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,910
Speaker 0: So I assume that means the multiplayer mode has been removed or is non-functioning.

236
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,210
Speaker 1: I wonder if it just doesn't work.

237
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,290
Speaker 1: I don't even remember how it worked.

238
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,088
Speaker 1: I assume it's just manual IP addresses.

239
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,910
Speaker 0: GOG is working on some sort of technology.

240
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,790
Speaker 0: They're using the old Alienverse Predator FPS as their test game.

241
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:46,749
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

242
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,729
Speaker 1: I remember that game.

243
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,769
Speaker 0: That's not a bad game.

244
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:56,890
Speaker 0: They're working on redeveloping game servers to get multiplayer working in good old games.

245
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:08,946
Speaker 0: And that once they get it working in that game and develop the tech, they might be able to get it working for games such as X-Wing Alliance or in a holy universe where there is a god, tribes two.

246
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:12,306
Speaker 1: Ah.

247
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,808
Speaker 1: My biggest fear now.

248
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:22,770
Speaker 1: Because I got a joystick and I've been playing this stuff and TIE Fighter is so good and I'm going to play X-Wing Alliance again because you're not like rebel, empire, whatever.

249
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,366
Speaker 1: You're just some guy with like a family and you fly a YT-3100.

250
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:29,250
Speaker 1: You know, basically the Millennium Falcon.

251
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:30,989
Speaker 0: Only crappier than the Millennium Falcon.

252
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:31,465
Speaker 0: Yup.

253
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,389
Speaker 1: And it's just like half life-ish.

254
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,490
Speaker 0: It doesn't do a Kessel Run in even one par say.

255
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,070
Speaker 1: It's like half life story mode.

256
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:43,130
Speaker 1: It's like, well, I got to protect my family from the pirates in the outer rim and what's all the fucking empires getting up in my grill.

257
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,210
Speaker 1: Eh, eh, these rebels are here.

258
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,149
Speaker 1: I wish they'd go away.

259
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:47,989
Speaker 1: I just want to do my whatevers.

260
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,190
Speaker 0: Why not just join the empire?

261
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,349
Speaker 0: Then everything will go well.

262
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:52,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think it has a branching story.

263
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:52,909
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

264
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,570
Speaker 1: I haven't played this game since middle school.

265
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,990
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're just a normal schmo and you don't actually care.

266
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:57,549
Speaker 1: High school.

267
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,198
Speaker 0: Like your life is going to be the same.

268
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:07,610
Speaker 0: either way, really, whether it's rebel or empire, you know, because you're just like farming happily and either side doesn't really give a shit, then why wouldn't you go with the empire?

269
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not just go with the Nazis?

270
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,710
Speaker 1: Because they're leaving you alone.

271
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:13,310
Speaker 0: Uh, what Nazi-ing did the empire do?

272
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,529
Speaker 1: They killed the entire planet.

273
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:18,430
Speaker 0: Uh, that was before this game.

274
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:19,429
Speaker 1: After this game.

275
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, when does this game occur, Scott?

276
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,708
Speaker 1: You don't know about it.

277
00:16:23,971 --> 00:16:24,730
Speaker 1: When does this game?

278
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:25,470
Speaker 1: Everyone knows.

279
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:26,330
Speaker 1: How do you not know?

280
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:29,050
Speaker 0: Uh, you live in some podunk planet.

281
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one here is like, oh yeah, where's Alderaan?

282
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:34,550
Speaker 0: I don't fly around to other planets.

283
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,889
Speaker 1: So, actually, X-Wing Alliance takes place shortly after the battle of Hoth.

284
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:41,110
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

285
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,448
Speaker 1: That's where it's set.

286
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:43,521
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

287
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:44,810
Speaker 0: All right.

288
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:45,426
Speaker 1: Yeah.

289
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,689
Speaker 0: So there's no Thrawn?

290
00:16:49,215 --> 00:16:49,967
Speaker 1: Uh, probably not.

291
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:50,945
Speaker 0: Wah-wah.

292
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,681
Speaker 0: Fail.

293
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:58,890
Speaker 1: My biggest fear is that there is going to be a legit new TIE fighter-ish Star Wars game, because Star Wars is bad.

294
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, I'm playing these a little bit, but if that happens.

295
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,130
Speaker 1: Well, my fear is that that will happen.

296
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,329
Speaker 0: I'm not playing them enough to warrant the joystick purchase.

297
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:15,790
Speaker 1: And it will be a good game, but it will be designed for a controller and not for a flightstick and thus be bullshit.

298
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,930
Speaker 0: And it might have a toggle in the settings.

299
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:27,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like playing TIE fighter again, I was reminded of how different a game that's designed for a joystick feels compared to a game that's designed for a controller.

300
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,009
Speaker 1: Or for a mouse.

301
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:31,290
Speaker 1: And go joystick.

302
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,710
Speaker 1: Like, if I can't have that, you know what I really want?

303
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:38,950
Speaker 1: I want it to come with the console, like in that old mech game where I have little widgets and buttons to push.

304
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:55,329
Speaker 0: Why don't you be that guy who, as your crazy hobby, makes a replica of the inside of a TIE fighter in your house that works perfectly with the game 100%, including like adjusting the inputs and everything, and then bring it to PAX and bring it to Star Wars Celebration and show it off.

305
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,208
Speaker 1: If we quick ignite.

306
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:03,309
Speaker 0: And a link of your website showing all the photos and videos that we passed around on Reddit and you get a million hits and shares on Facebook.

307
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:05,310
Speaker 1: Starting after PAX South.

308
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:08,510
Speaker 1: Give me two or three years, I could probably have that together.

309
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,446
Speaker 0: Just do it in your spare time instead of, I don't know, rock climbing or some dumb skiing shit.

310
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:17,010
Speaker 0: Just get one of those things and do this instead.

311
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:17,989
Speaker 0: It's nerdier.

312
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:26,430
Speaker 1: Anyway, things of the day.

313
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:34,150
Speaker 1: TED Talks were amazing and then I kind of got sick of them because a lot of them were increasingly kind of woo woo or information sparse.

314
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,225
Speaker 0: Well the woo woo ones mostly leaked in in the TEDx's.

315
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:39,510
Speaker 0: that weren't very well.

316
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,822
Speaker 1: But even some TED Talks, they weren't woo woo in the.

317
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:46,455
Speaker 1: this is chiropractic or acupuncture, but they were woo woo in the.

318
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:52,430
Speaker 1: this is a really lofty vague idea that doesn't actually go anywhere, and you obviously paid a lot of money to be involved in all this.

319
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also, people might learn things watching TED videos.

320
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,250
Speaker 0: I definitely learned things when I did watch them way back in the day.

321
00:18:58,374 --> 00:18:58,809
Speaker 0: Kiki Bulba?

322
00:18:59,610 --> 00:18:59,703
Speaker 1: Yeah.

323
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,430
Speaker 1: I learned Kiki Bulba.

324
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:09,290
Speaker 0: I learned a lot of things, but, you know, they seem to be acting like we're changing the world with these talks and videos and things, and they haven't changed shit as far as I can tell.

325
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,167
Speaker 1: You'll learn more from a crash course than you will from TEDs.

326
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:13,270
Speaker 0: Yes.

327
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:13,828
Speaker 1: Fun fact.

328
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,790
Speaker 1: Scott and I had a TEDx license we never used.

329
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,406
Speaker 1: We were going to run a TEDx and then we just didn't have time and we backed out like we were.

330
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,208
Speaker 1: Anyway, that was a long time ago.

331
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:23,702
Speaker 0: Yeah.

332
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:33,428
Speaker 1: So this is a parody of every TED talk, and it's about the same thing that Seinfeld is about.

333
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,150
Speaker 0: If you see this, you don't need to see any other TED talks except for Kiki Bulba one.

334
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:44,241
Speaker 1: And I just want to point out that the top comment on this YouTube video is, and I quote, "This guy eats his own

335
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:44,544
Speaker 1: shit.".

336
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:47,009
Speaker 1: So watch this video.

337
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,170
Speaker 0: He probably says so himself.

338
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:51,308
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

339
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:53,010
Speaker 0: All right.

340
00:19:53,390 --> 00:20:10,450
Speaker 0: So the AGDQ just ended, the Awesome Games Done Quick, the annual, well, recently ended, the annual spectacle celebration of speed running and also donating money to fight cancer and save the animals in Super Metroid, which is the right way to do it.

341
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:20,010
Speaker 0: It was actually kind of interesting because every year so far, Kill the Animals has won in the donations because people want to, you know, it's faster that way.

342
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,320
Speaker 0: So, you know, all these speed run.

343
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,470
Speaker 0: people like, "You got to kill the animals.

344
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,230
Speaker 0: You can't be saving them.

345
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:23,433
Speaker 0: That's

346
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:23,721
Speaker 0: slower.".

347
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:35,230
Speaker 0: At the very last second, well, Save the Animals is winning the whole time, but then Kill the Animals pulled ahead towards the end because everyone waits until Super Metroid is actually being played to start donating, including myself.

348
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:48,463
Speaker 0: At the very last possible second, some dude, we don't know who it is, donated like multiple tens of thousands to put Save the Animals over the line, and his donation message was just, "Get

349
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:48,808
Speaker 0: rekt.".

350
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:49,547
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

351
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:51,108
Speaker 1: I got a second thing of the day.

352
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:51,710
Speaker 0: Okay.

353
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,610
Speaker 1: Ben Couture just tweeted this.

354
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,850
Speaker 1: It's a super cut of every user interface in the first Star Wars movie.

355
00:20:58,098 --> 00:20:58,310
Speaker 1: Okay.

356
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:58,928
Speaker 1: Episode four.

357
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,190
Speaker 1: Every TIE fighter X-wing interface.

358
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,890
Speaker 0: Well, you can use that when you're making your replica.

359
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:03,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can.

360
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:03,950
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

361
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:04,850
Speaker 0: That's your reference material.

362
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:07,170
Speaker 1: So, anyway, continue.

363
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:14,970
Speaker 0: So, at the AGDQ, there are many amazing things to see this year, but the most amazing of them all to me was Tetris the Grandmaster.

364
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:19,330
Speaker 0: So, I had known about Tetris the Grandmaster for a long time.

365
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,043
Speaker 0: It's basically this arcade Tetris version in Japan that you can get.

366
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:27,870
Speaker 0: that is ridiculously hard, and there are people who can play it, and they're amazing at Tetris.

367
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,989
Speaker 0: More amazing than anyone else.

368
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,950
Speaker 0: It's the hardest Tetris.

369
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:38,090
Speaker 0: Not until I watched this video did I truly understand everything that is to know about Tetris the Grandmaster.

370
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:40,670
Speaker 0: I mean, everything I knew was correct.

371
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:43,729
Speaker 0: It is the hardest, most crazy Tetris arcade game in Japan.

372
00:21:44,911 --> 00:22:00,069
Speaker 0: It is far crazier than I could possibly imagine, and in this video we see what is almost definitely the best non-Japanese Tetris Grandmaster players demonstrate their skill as and explain to you all the things that I have learned.

373
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:09,054
Speaker 0: If you know or care about video games at all, I don't care if you don't like speed running, and yes, it is a speed run even though it's Tetris, and you'll understand if you watch it.

374
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:18,649
Speaker 0: You need to understand what Tetris the Grandmaster is all about because these people are simultaneously the saddest and the most glorious gamers I have ever seen.

375
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:29,170
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, we are going to be live at PacSouth this weekend on Sunday, January 25th at 4.30pm in the Armadillo Theater.

376
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:32,130
Speaker 1: We are presenting Bad Games.

377
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:32,770
Speaker 0: So bad.

378
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:33,847
Speaker 1: The baddest.

379
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:40,208
Speaker 1: And if we get set up early and let the audience in early, we're just going to play Outlaw until the panel starts.

380
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:42,110
Speaker 1: It's going to be a good time.

381
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,230
Speaker 0: Also known as Pretzel Cowboy.

382
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:43,605
Speaker 1: Yep.

383
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,510
Speaker 1: The book club book is Watership Down.

384
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,850
Speaker 1: It's a story about amazing rabbits on an amazing journey.

385
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:48,969
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll read it on an airplane.

386
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:49,748
Speaker 1: Maybe you should.

387
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:54,370
Speaker 0: When you get to the cultist rabbits, I think you're- I've already selected the next book club book.

388
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:56,430
Speaker 1: I've selected the next next book club book.

389
00:22:57,351 --> 00:23:03,590
Speaker 1: If yours is a bad book, however, I'm redirecting back toward Monsieur Dumas.

390
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,530
Speaker 0: I don't know if mine is bad.

391
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,610
Speaker 1: I don't know either, but I'm just saying Dumas is just hanging out.

392
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:09,830
Speaker 1: Just waiting in the wings.

393
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:11,627
Speaker 1: Just waiting for me to tag him in.

394
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,368
Speaker 1: Le Combe de Monte Cristo.

395
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,150
Speaker 0: Anyway.

396
00:23:19,018 --> 00:23:19,290
Speaker 1: Anyway.

397
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:24,230
Speaker 1: And I started a new live streaming series and I'm going to keep improving on it.

398
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:30,209
Speaker 1: People always ask me, well no, one or two people have occasionally asked me how to be good at Advance Wars.

399
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,290
Speaker 1: So I'm putting together a series on how to be good at Advance Wars.

400
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,744
Speaker 0: And perhaps you can find all the other Advance Wars players and get them together and form a thing.

401
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:39,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we should.

402
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:40,828
Speaker 0: Advance Wars speed runs.

403
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,809
Speaker 0: You can go to AGDQ next year and do the run.

404
00:23:45,670 --> 00:24:01,730
Speaker 1: So what I did, one of these videos, I played a small puzzle map against myself because the AI is just not good enough to be worth talking about to try to show two omniscient opponents fighting each other how the logic breaks down game wise.

405
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,489
Speaker 1: And the first comment in the live stream was- This guy sure likes playing with himself.

406
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:07,874
Speaker 1: No, that should have been.

407
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:12,789
Speaker 1: the first comment was, wow, it is amazing how intense this guy is against himself.

408
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,548
Speaker 1: He is really into this.

409
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:24,548
Speaker 1: And then I realized when I watched it after the fact to see how this dream went, I was playing as Blue and I'm like, so Blue's probably going to try, he's going to build a tank because that's the only thing he can do.

410
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:28,610
Speaker 1: So I got to build these mechs and do this thing and hopefully Blue won't go north.

411
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:34,024
Speaker 1: And then when I'm Blue, I'm like, so obviously I'm not going to build a tank because that asshole built those mechs.

412
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:39,247
Speaker 1: So instead I'm building the anti-air and I am going north because that's what he didn't expect.

413
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:43,550
Speaker 1: It was weird watching myself compartmentalize the two sides.

414
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:48,250
Speaker 1: It was kind of, it was actually weird watching me play after I made the video.

415
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:48,829
Speaker 1: All right.

416
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,768
Speaker 1: Like super weird.

417
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,589
Speaker 0: Other meta things that I can think of.

418
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,168
Speaker 1: We're going to be at PAX East presenting on Friday, March 6th.

419
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,490
Speaker 0: PAX East is ridiculously close to PAX Out.

420
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,990
Speaker 1: 4.30 PM and PAX OZ just happened.

421
00:25:00,971 --> 00:25:02,409
Speaker 0: Anime Boston's also coming up.

422
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,269
Speaker 0: So is Zenkai Con.

423
00:25:03,372 --> 00:25:04,270
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

424
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,949
Speaker 0: It's convention season has moved from summer to spring.

425
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,110
Speaker 1: See Genericon, I know you wanted us to come.

426
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,190
Speaker 1: This is why we can't come.

427
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:10,830
Speaker 1: We're sorry.

428
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,130
Speaker 0: It's also Netrunner's store championship season.

429
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:14,209
Speaker 0: If anyone cares.

430
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:22,569
Speaker 1: But on Friday, March 6th, also at 4.30 PM in the Bumblebee Theater, we are presenting what is losing at PAX East.

431
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,229
Speaker 1: Welcome to our panel and find out.

432
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,067
Speaker 0: It is living with the name of Rim.

433
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:28,290
Speaker 1: And it is not just.

434
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,950
Speaker 0: Your name is Rim and you're alive.

435
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:31,250
Speaker 0: My losing panel.

436
00:25:33,353 --> 00:25:37,110
Speaker 1: I did a panel called Losing at PAX Australia and this is not that.

437
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,790
Speaker 0: You're an expert on the topic.

438
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,149
Speaker 0: Of course you should be doing that.

439
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,050
Speaker 1: I'm in fact an expert on losing for the only way to become a winner is to understand the loser.

440
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:46,150
Speaker 0: To be the loser.

441
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:49,410
Speaker 1: To defeat the loser, you must become the loser.

442
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:51,429
Speaker 1: That is where Juggalos came from.

443
00:25:51,754 --> 00:25:51,925
Speaker 0: Okay.

444
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,730
Speaker 1: So we played a tabletop game.

445
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,170
Speaker 0: Okay, so I've played this game twice.

446
00:25:57,712 --> 00:25:58,949
Speaker 1: I've played it once.

447
00:25:59,232 --> 00:25:59,670
Speaker 0: It's enough.

448
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,269
Speaker 0: Alright, so what this game is King's Forge.

449
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,670
Speaker 0: It is made and designed by a person named Nick Sibicki.

450
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,309
Speaker 0: I think it was a kick-started game.

451
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:10,750
Speaker 0: It was published.

452
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:11,950
Speaker 1: Was it a kick-starter game?

453
00:26:12,192 --> 00:26:13,129
Speaker 0: I think it was.

454
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:19,649
Speaker 1: Because in my experience, and I'm going to lay down some real sad, ugly truth right here.

455
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:26,370
Speaker 1: Games that are kick-started, that are tabletop games, tend to be fucking awful.

456
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:30,210
Speaker 1: It is very rare that they are not fucking awful.

457
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,130
Speaker 0: King's Forge was indeed kick-started.

458
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,930
Speaker 0: They had a buy game salute.

459
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:40,070
Speaker 0: They had a goal of $5,000 and they made $80,000.

460
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,669
Speaker 1: Guys, don't kick-start board games.

461
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,610
Speaker 0: Okay, so, King's Forge.

462
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,810
Speaker 0: What is King's Forge about?

463
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,750
Speaker 0: Basically, I really like the theme of this game.

464
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,190
Speaker 0: Everyone is some sort of smith or artisan, and the king wants goods.

465
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:59,830
Speaker 0: And you're forging goods for the king, and whoever forges enough goods first is the best.

466
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,490
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what you forge, it's just, do you forge stuff?

467
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:06,630
Speaker 1: Now, there's a limited set of things to be forged that the king will want, and it's Dominion style.

468
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:12,149
Speaker 1: Every time you play, you make basically a splay of, "This is what will be forged in this

469
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:12,289
Speaker 1: game.".

470
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,249
Speaker 0: There's like five things the king wants.

471
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:18,110
Speaker 0: If you can forge one of them first, you give it to the king.

472
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,546
Speaker 0: He's like, "Alright, I got the thing I

473
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:19,789
Speaker 0: want.".

474
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:23,190
Speaker 0: Even if someone else forges it, which they can't, there's no point.

475
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,681
Speaker 0: The king is like, "I already got one of those.

476
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:25,085
Speaker 0: Don't need

477
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:25,186
Speaker 0: it.".

478
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:34,081
Speaker 0: So, if you show up at the king's door some number of times, three times, four times first, then he's like, "Whoa, you've been forging a whole bunch of stuff for me.

479
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:34,905
Speaker 0: You're the awesomest.

480
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:35,608
Speaker 0: You

481
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:35,829
Speaker 0: win.".

482
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:36,990
Speaker 0: And that's how the game goes.

483
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:43,870
Speaker 0: So, mechanically, it's really very similar to Splendor, only random and bullshit.

484
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:51,189
Speaker 1: So, if you look at this game without reading the rules, you just look at what it looks like, you think it's going to be Yahtzee.

485
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of cool physically as well.

486
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,690
Speaker 0: There's cards with awesome art of different items to make for the king.

487
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,830
Speaker 0: There's this cool area where you're working to build up your dice.

488
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:04,859
Speaker 0: All kinds of different colored dice.

489
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:05,502
Speaker 0: Tons of them.

490
00:28:05,522 --> 00:28:06,246
Speaker 0: You get to roll them.

491
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:06,970
Speaker 0: It's a lot of fun.

492
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, the multicolors of dice give you this really good feeling of, "Oh, fuck yeah, I got some red dice

493
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:11,630
Speaker 1: now.".

494
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,253
Speaker 0: It's all different.

495
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:15,850
Speaker 0: When you're choosing, you can choose a little plaque for your player.

496
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:17,157
Speaker 0: I always choose the green owl.

497
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,770
Speaker 0: Owl is an awesome animal, and green is the best color.

498
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:22,679
Speaker 0: But there's all these other choices, like purple dragon.

499
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,750
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of good stuff going on in this game.

500
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:32,350
Speaker 0: But, the bad part about this game is basically in the details.

501
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:40,030
Speaker 0: If they had just changed the details of this game a little bit, they could have made it polished and smooth and actually really, really good.

502
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:52,270
Speaker 0: But because, in the details, there are flaws that do not exist in a more tested and proven game like Splendor, what ends up happening is there's a huge advantage to the first player on the first turn.

503
00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:53,310
Speaker 1: Most of the time.

504
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:53,970
Speaker 0: Most of the time.

505
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,610
Speaker 1: That will only not occur if basically only hard to forge things come out.

506
00:28:59,111 --> 00:29:00,295
Speaker 1: Yes.

507
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:04,910
Speaker 0: Also, there is a huge luck advantage in general.

508
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,030
Speaker 0: Not just the dice rolling, because you can sort of mitigate the dice rolling.

509
00:29:08,492 --> 00:29:12,650
Speaker 0: You can't mitigate the like, well, these are the choices that are available to me on my turn.

510
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:12,970
Speaker 0: Yep.

511
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:19,310
Speaker 1: You actually have a very limited, like you have a limited, so basically there's some options that are always out there that you can just do if you want.

512
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:23,550
Speaker 1: Or, you can use one of the options that's flipped up.

513
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:24,072
Speaker 0: Right, right.

514
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:26,770
Speaker 0: Okay, so let me explain it better so people aren't completely lost.

515
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,156
Speaker 0: Everyone has a bunch of dice.

516
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,670
Speaker 0: Some black dice you start with.

517
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, boring dice, crap dice.

518
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:47,070
Speaker 0: But you can get better, you can basically, on your turn, you can, if you want to, do something which usually involves spending dice, either losing them permanently or for the turn, in order to get better dice that you only will be able to use on a future turn.

519
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:53,190
Speaker 1: So for example, give up three black dice this turn, and then for the next turn you get a green die.

520
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:59,010
Speaker 0: Yep, or give up a green die permanently, get a blue die starting next turn.

521
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:04,970
Speaker 0: Then at the end of your turn, any dice that haven't been used, you get to roll.

522
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:14,290
Speaker 0: And when you roll them, if you roll adequately enough to match the requirements listed in one of the king's items, then you forge that item.

523
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:19,830
Speaker 1: So like this item needs three red dice of five or higher, and four black dice of one or higher.

524
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:25,890
Speaker 0: Right, so you have to A, have enough dice to meet that, first of all, and B, roll them and get that result.

525
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:31,869
Speaker 0: So if you have enough red and black dice, you roll them, and one of the red die is too low, you missed it.

526
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,609
Speaker 0: You don't get to forge it this turn.

527
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:44,690
Speaker 1: And then it has this tie-breaking thing, so say I forge an object, and then when we get to Scott, he can forge the same object, and his dice on a one-to-one matchup are higher than my dice?

528
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, every single die I have has to be higher than yours.

529
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:54,390
Speaker 0: So even if, let's say, it's a very simple one, you need a red three, red at least three, black at least three.

530
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,630
Speaker 0: Rim rolls four four, red four, black four.

531
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:01,929
Speaker 0: I roll red six, black three.

532
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:08,590
Speaker 0: So I met the requirements, and in fact, if you add up my numbers, I actually have one higher than him.

533
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,910
Speaker 0: I have nine worth and eight worth, he has eight worth, and we've both met the requirements.

534
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:20,110
Speaker 0: But because both of my dice are not both higher than his, every single one has to be higher, I don't get it.

535
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,309
Speaker 0: He gets it because he went first.

536
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,249
Speaker 1: Yep, which is, that is fine.

537
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:23,865
Speaker 0: Yes.

538
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:28,050
Speaker 1: Except, so there's a first mover advantage on taking items.

539
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:35,170
Speaker 1: There's a first mover advantage just in terms of the objects, like the actions you have available to you during the game.

540
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:41,050
Speaker 1: And the turn order only rotates clockwise based on the passing of the overdone anvil.

541
00:31:41,431 --> 00:31:41,673
Speaker 1: Yep.

542
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:45,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, the anvil, it's like, the game has really good, I told you, construction of pieces.

543
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:49,230
Speaker 0: Whose turn of his marker is a big plastic anvil.

544
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,031
Speaker 0: I feel

545
00:31:50,071 --> 00:32:12,630
Speaker 1: like the game was not play-tested enough to determine the fact that there are two forces giving advantage to the person who goes first in the overall game, and to the person who's currently going first, and because the number of things you need to forge to end and win the game, whoever goes first is likely to get the advantage more than other people.

546
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:31,710
Speaker 0: Usually at the beginning of the game, there is like an easy to forge item that pretty much anyone could forge on turn one just by rolling all their black die, and it's not many more or less valuable than any other item, but if there's only one or two of these things, the first or second player is almost guaranteed to get them, no matter what the other players try to do.

547
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:37,710
Speaker 0: So obviously the strategy for the other players is to give up on them, and spend that turn upgrading to get better items.

548
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:55,930
Speaker 0: The thing is, the other players can also spend their turn upgrading and still get those items, and they're just basically one item ahead the whole game, and it's very hard to out-compete them unless all of the items that appeared are difficult, and then everyone has to spend their turns building up and can't get anything easily.

549
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:30,070
Speaker 1: And because you basically get, at the end of the build-up phase, the one roll, sometimes you just get completely fucked, and the only real strategy is deciding, based on how far behind you are, how much you're willing to risk, in terms of, like, the game seems to come down to, well, Scott will win on his turn unless he rolls badly, so rather than taking a long-shot chance of being able to beat him in case he rolls well, I'm just going to spend this turn developing, bank on him failing,

550
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,134
Speaker 0: Because I have no other choice.

551
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:34,550
Speaker 0: There's no way to attack the other players, other than going before them.

552
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,216
Speaker 1: So, that's the other problem.

553
00:33:36,477 --> 00:33:39,910
Speaker 1: There are a handful of things that let you attack other players.

554
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:40,617
Speaker 0: Oh, that's right.

555
00:33:40,637 --> 00:33:41,450
Speaker 0: They're very tiny, though.

556
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:50,630
Speaker 1: Because there's so few of them, they just devastate individual players, primarily for spite and leaderkeeping and things like that.

557
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,490
Speaker 1: Like, they're very... either have those things be common or don't have them at all.

558
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,949
Speaker 1: I hate games where, like, oh, there's this one way you can attack that comes up sometimes.

559
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:02,450
Speaker 1: Either be an attacking game or don't be an attacking game.

560
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:19,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you look at other really well-designed games, say, Power Grid, one of the all-time great games of tabletop in general, it gives an advantage to the first player, sometimes, in the house buying, because you get the cheapest house spots first, because you get to go first.

561
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then it mitigates it.

562
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:27,330
Speaker 0: But it mitigates it because in the auctions, it kind of sucks to go first.

563
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,574
Speaker 1: Well, look at Sellers of Catan.

564
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:33,570
Speaker 1: If you place your first settlement first, you get the best spot on the board.

565
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,889
Speaker 1: You place your second settlement last.

566
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:42,810
Speaker 1: The guy who places his first one last gets to place both at the same time, so he's guaranteed to get the spots he wants.

567
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,649
Speaker 1: And it's actually super balanced.

568
00:34:46,051 --> 00:35:03,010
Speaker 0: All good games, you know, have some way to mitigate where going first is good sometimes and bad sometimes, and it moves in such a way, you know, that it's not... So in this game, just going first in the first turn of the game is a ginormous advantage, and going first in any given turn is a ginormous advantage on that given turn.

569
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:08,450
Speaker 0: So you just try to go first, and then you're going to be very easily winning this game.

570
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,477
Speaker 1: The rules are also a little bit obtuse.

571
00:35:10,518 --> 00:35:13,310
Speaker 1: The terminology is pretty consistent, but not great.

572
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:20,069
Speaker 1: It took far longer to teach this game than it should have, for how complex this game actually is.

573
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:33,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's actually a really simple game to play, but learning it just took a long time, because for whatever reason, you know, the way the instructions are written, the way the cards are worded, those sorts of things.

574
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:36,276
Speaker 0: And all the sorts of, like, catchy situations.

575
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:41,607
Speaker 0: Like, it took a minute to explain, "I have a 6 and a 3, that's 9, that's higher than his 4 and

576
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,130
Speaker 0: 4.".

577
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:49,790
Speaker 0: But he met the requirement, he met it first, and I have to have both of my dice have to meet or exceed all of his.

578
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:58,310
Speaker 0: So, even if just one of my dice is lower, if every single other die I have exceeds his, if just one is lower, I can't take it away from him.

579
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:05,229
Speaker 1: You have such limited options, that you're only, you know, there's the fiddly, like, "Do I do this one thing or this other one

580
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,430
Speaker 1: thing?".

581
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:11,788
Speaker 1: But in general, your decisions come down to, "Do I invest in this turn, or the next

582
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:12,430
Speaker 1: turn?".

583
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:14,610
Speaker 0: And there's not going to be that many turns.

584
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,914
Speaker 1: You have no other choice.

585
00:36:15,994 --> 00:36:17,620
Speaker 1: Invest now, or invest later.

586
00:36:18,082 --> 00:36:20,170
Speaker 1: Everything else is pretty obvious and boring.

587
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:27,090
Speaker 0: The way Splendor mitigates a lot of this, is this, in this game, you get like, what, 4 items or something, and it's over, and that's it.

588
00:36:27,912 --> 00:36:30,420
Speaker 0: In Splendor, it's like, you're buying cards like crazy.

589
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,810
Speaker 0: There's so many things to buy constantly coming out all the time.

590
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:46,670
Speaker 0: If King's Forge is like, "Forge a ton of items over 10 turns over forges the most wins," and you're forging quite crazy, then that can mitigate so much of the luck, because not everything is tied up, and like, one big item is it.

591
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:57,870
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, I'm forging a whole bunch of stuff, everyone's forging a whole bunch of stuff, and then it comes down to the smaller optimizations in your play, as opposed to the random chance, I got that one item by luck, I win.

592
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:05,550
Speaker 1: Yep, and the other problem I had was with the, you know, you get the semi-randomized set of actions that are going to be available, and that's the set for the whole game.

593
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:15,010
Speaker 1: So it has that dominion aspect of, the actual decision is, based on the set of actions that are going to be in this game, what is the clearest path to victory?

594
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:24,650
Speaker 1: However, because of your limited interaction with those things, and the way the turns work, you have no actual choice as to whether or not to follow that strategy.

595
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:35,410
Speaker 0: Right, you're sitting there looking, and it's like, well, there's the actions that are already available, that are always available, and one of them is clearly superior, that haven't been taken yet, and then here are the actions that are available at this moment that I can take.

596
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:56,525
Speaker 0: So you pick the best one, and you can't take anything else into account, and then as soon as you take one, if it's one of the temporary ones, you immediately physically take it, and another one is immediately revealed for the next player, that might be the best one, it just happened to appear on their turn, and if you hadn't taken one of the temporary ones, they wouldn't have seen that, the next person would have seen it, or someone, you know, but

597
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:57,470
Speaker 1: there's no way to know.

598
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:09,869
Speaker 1: Now meanwhile, another game that has a similar mechanical sort of, I don't want to say problem, but nuance, is Hansa Teutonica, because if you take a special plate, you have to put another one out, that the next player...

599
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:18,090
Speaker 0: But you can put it in a place where they can't get it easily, or it benefits you, and mitigate the fact that you have to put out this awesome plate, that you might...

600
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:20,160
Speaker 1: So you get a, you know what I call this?

601
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,710
Speaker 1: You get a boon, the awesome boon.

602
00:38:22,493 --> 00:38:35,809
Speaker 0: You might have taken an extra office plate just to get a plate, and then you're forced to put out an extra action plate on the board that you really would have rather had, but now every other person is going to get a chance to go for that plate before you can even make a move

603
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:36,090
Speaker 1: on it.

604
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:47,110
Speaker 1: So if you choose to take the boon, the plate or an action that's one of the temporary cards that's out there, then you have to accept the bust of the next player, the person to your left, now has an advantage.

605
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,430
Speaker 1: You get a nudge after that in Hansa Teutonica.

606
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,470
Speaker 1: You can nudge that bust in a direction that's beneficial to you.

607
00:38:55,211 --> 00:39:02,890
Speaker 1: In this game, you can't do that, and in this game, your only options are take a shitty action, or take one of the temp actions.

608
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,970
Speaker 1: You're always giving the next player.

609
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:15,990
Speaker 1: There's never a good tactical or strategic reason to take the bad action, the suboptimal one, just to prevent the player to your left from getting a better possible action.

610
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:24,690
Speaker 0: So on your turn, all you end up doing is taking the best possible action you can, and then everything else is completely up to luck.

611
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,142
Speaker 0: So there aren't really a lot of meaningful decisions.

612
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:37,430
Speaker 0: once you've figured this out, and it comes down to rolling dice and whose turn it is and what cards appear, and it gets pretty close to Candyland amongst smart people.

613
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:40,299
Speaker 1: Yep, so who is this game good for?

614
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,770
Speaker 1: If you're a gamer gamer, I really wouldn't buy this game.

615
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,750
Speaker 1: I would play it occasionally.

616
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,690
Speaker 0: Just get Splendor, and it's almost the same game without the bullshit.

617
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,150
Speaker 1: Now, because I already know how to play it, if someone else busted it out at a con and said, "Hey, you want to play

618
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,230
Speaker 1: it?".

619
00:39:52,250 --> 00:40:01,770
Speaker 0: If I didn't have to pay for it, and I was curious, and I was a really big tabletop gamer, I would definitely play it at least once or twice to understand what we're talking about, because there are lessons to learn from this game.

620
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:06,190
Speaker 1: Yes, but if you're good at games, I mean, I would play Castles of Burgundy over this.

621
00:40:07,192 --> 00:40:09,199
Speaker 0: This game can also have drama.

622
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:16,090
Speaker 0: If the luck ends up being in the dice rolling, it's possible there could be exciting drama in this game.

623
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:30,131
Speaker 0: It didn't happen when we played because people mitigated the luck as much as smart people do, but someone could theoretically just go big, just try to go for it, and end up getting like 66666 or something crazy or 111.

624
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:37,010
Speaker 0: That should have been an easy grab of that item, but I rolled a bunch of ones, and I didn't have any of the automatically turn my dice to six things.

625
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,975
Speaker 0: Which is fine.

626
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:40,730
Speaker 1: I mean, when the goalie scores in hockey, that's amazing.

627
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,210
Speaker 0: Right.

628
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,426
Speaker 1: But this game...

629
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,515
Speaker 0: It happens rarely.

630
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:45,710
Speaker 0: I played it twice, and that happened zero times.

631
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,465
Speaker 0: It was just theoretically always in the back of everyone's mind.

632
00:40:48,505 --> 00:40:49,230
Speaker 0: It never actually happened.

633
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:55,730
Speaker 1: So in terms of the brain feel as a result, if I win or lose this game, those two feelings are not different.

634
00:40:56,331 --> 00:41:04,530
Speaker 1: Because if I win, I feel like it was because of the luck and the randomness and the order of the cards, and if I lose, it's because of the exact same thing.

635
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:12,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is one of those games I get frustrated playing, and it's like, I'm usually not frustrated playing a bad game or losing a good game.

636
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:17,130
Speaker 0: I'm frustrated when there's a potential for goodness that was taken away.

637
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:23,008
Speaker 1: You know how many times when the rules were being explained to us, me or Scott would be like, "Oh, and then you do X because that would be

638
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:23,310
Speaker 1: cool?".

639
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,228
Speaker 1: And then the guy's like, "Uh, no, actually, you just do

640
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:26,490
Speaker 1: Y.".

641
00:41:26,635 --> 00:41:26,830
Speaker 0: Right.

642
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:49,750
Speaker 0: This game, if they had just playtested it more, worked on it harder, and didn't spend all their Kickstarter money on a fancy plastic anvil and high-quality pieces and high-quality arts and all the other things that actually were kind of good about this thing, if they had made the game better, then this could have been like even maybe even competing with Splendor because that dice part actually, you know, but they failed.

643
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,478
Speaker 1: So, something interesting.

644
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,090
Speaker 1: I went to BoardGameGeek just to see if there's any interesting notes about this.

645
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,560
Speaker 1: The top post about this game is, "Shill alert!

646
00:41:58,841 --> 00:42:00,145
Speaker 1: The King's Forge 7.38 rating seems

647
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:00,366
Speaker 1: bogus.".

648
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:03,746
Speaker 0: So many fake 10 ratings.

649
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:10,670
Speaker 1: Quote, "I almost bought this game today, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but then I came to look at the game comments before I pulled the trigger.

650
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:19,069
Speaker 1: I noticed that seven of the nine BGG users who gave King's Forge a 10 had no avatars or badges of any

651
00:42:19,129 --> 00:42:19,450
Speaker 1: kind.".

652
00:42:19,963 --> 00:42:20,107
Speaker 0: Okay.

653
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,099
Speaker 1: "And appeared to be new

654
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:21,585
Speaker 1: accounts.".

655
00:42:22,117 --> 00:42:22,410
Speaker 0: All right.

656
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:28,409
Speaker 1: "They had no comments and didn't blah, blah, blah, and then he posted a bunch of evidence and...".

657
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:34,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, people Kickstarting a game are very likely to, you know, my work is actually having the same thing.

658
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:38,529
Speaker 0: We have like apps in the App Store and it's like, "Should we go submit fake

659
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:38,850
Speaker 0: ratings?".

660
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:39,593
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "I'm

661
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:39,894
Speaker 0: not.".

662
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:44,030
Speaker 0: And I think it's, you know, do you just want to be dishonest and evil if you do it?

663
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,585
Speaker 1: "But if I made it, don't I think it's a great

664
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:46,948
Speaker 1: app?"

665
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:47,491
Speaker 1: Right?

666
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:48,614
Speaker 0: But it's like, go for it.

667
00:42:48,654 --> 00:42:54,610
Speaker 0: Go submit your, you know, fake, you know, review that you want for your own app to try to boost it up in the App Store ratings.

668
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:56,810
Speaker 0: Instead of letting it live on its own merits.

669
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,589
Speaker 1: Just don't click on your own ads in YouTube or your account is going to be fucking shut down.

670
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:02,667
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that another time.

671
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,410
Speaker 0: At least the AdSense part of your account.

672
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:04,808
Speaker 0: Yeah.

673
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,510
Speaker 0: They'll still let you make videos.

674
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,830
Speaker 1: But I guess King's Forge reminds me so much of Ground Floor.

675
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:20,750
Speaker 1: In both games were Kickstarters with really high production values that obviously did not get a lot of playtesting.

676
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:31,450
Speaker 1: And the rules were written by people who obviously don't have a lot of experience with like the history of tabletop game rules as written by everyone else in the world.

677
00:43:32,713 --> 00:43:34,462
Speaker 1: They make a lot of amateur mistakes.

678
00:43:34,764 --> 00:43:35,930
Speaker 1: There's obvious flaws.

679
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:40,770
Speaker 1: There's usually like a fixed rule or errata that comes out pretty soon after the game.

680
00:43:41,272 --> 00:43:45,309
Speaker 1: Like the thing that was in Ground Floor that was really broken was that advertising thing.

681
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:50,030
Speaker 1: That part of the game where you'd like put your, I forget exactly what it was called.

682
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:50,930
Speaker 0: No, I know exactly what you're talking about.

683
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:58,410
Speaker 1: Because it was designed so counterintuitively and so stupidly that players wanted to ignore it because it wasn't fun to deal with.

684
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:03,050
Speaker 1: But because the rest of the game was badly designed, it was actually the only thing that mattered.

685
00:44:03,811 --> 00:44:08,470
Speaker 1: Ground Floor is very similar in that there's no way this game got a lot of playtesting.

686
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:12,790
Speaker 1: Or if it did, only amateur hour people playtested it.

687
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:24,530
Speaker 0: Right, my guess is that sort of what we're seeing here with a lot of the Kickstarted board games is there are people who play games, who are making tabletop games.

688
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:31,510
Speaker 0: And the things with video games is at least a barrier to entry to where you need to learn how to code or at least learn how to use Game Maker.

689
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:37,170
Speaker 0: You need to have some specialized knowledge to make a video game and it takes a while.

690
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:43,950
Speaker 0: So this barrier to entry where it's kind of hard to make a well-produced, completely bad video game.

691
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:52,630
Speaker 0: If you've completely produced and well-made a video game code and art-wise, you must know something kind of good.

692
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:59,010
Speaker 1: Well, we were just at an event at Microsoft where we got to demo a whole bunch of unreleased indie video and tabletop games.

693
00:44:59,050 --> 00:44:59,451
Speaker 1: You know what?

694
00:45:00,493 --> 00:45:07,410
Speaker 1: The unreleased didn't put a lot of time into these yet and far from polished video games were almost universally amazing.

695
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:16,510
Speaker 0: You could see unique things in there that if they just worked on them some more, they could turn into gold, like Nidhogg level gold.

696
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:28,550
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, and I've got another ugly truth here, almost every tabletop game that is indie and unreleased that I've ever playtested or played or done a demo of with anyone has been awful.

697
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:30,175
Speaker 1: Almost every.

698
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:31,100
Speaker 1: There are exceptions.

699
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,010
Speaker 1: Like Jeremy's game he's working on is actually really good.

700
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.

701
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:36,850
Speaker 0: Jeremy's game is better than any tabletop game I've demoed.

702
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,530
Speaker 1: Or like that weirdo Luke Crane when he made us play that tabletop game that one time at UberCon.

703
00:45:41,831 --> 00:45:42,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, that roleplaying game.

704
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:46,325
Speaker 1: Or then now the mouse swords game.

705
00:45:46,586 --> 00:45:47,370
Speaker 1: Swords and strongholds.

706
00:45:47,973 --> 00:45:49,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's made by a real game maker.

707
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:50,692
Speaker 0: Exactly.

708
00:45:50,952 --> 00:45:57,110
Speaker 1: The barrier to entry of tabletop is low so a lot of tabletop games get kickstarted with really high production values.

709
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:00,384
Speaker 0: Well, also you don't need to be a good tabletop game to make a lot of money.

710
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:00,966
Speaker 0: Look at Munchkin.

711
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:01,750
Speaker 0: Munchkin is the king.

712
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:02,183
Speaker 0: Yeah.

713
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:03,749
Speaker 0: Cryptozoic is the king.

714
00:46:03,974 --> 00:46:04,059
Speaker 0: Yeah.

715
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:05,855
Speaker 0: That's what people are going for.

716
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:08,326
Speaker 0: They got $80,000 for their kickstarter no matter what.

717
00:46:08,668 --> 00:46:09,150
Speaker 0: They have the money.

718
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:15,050
Speaker 1: If I were budgeting to make a tabletop game, it would be more than $80,000.

719
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, they asked for $5,000.

720
00:46:17,412 --> 00:46:22,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I were, this is me, the product manager, like all the other work I do in my life.

721
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:29,925
Speaker 1: If I were budgeting a company to make a game like Kings Forge and sell it for real, my budget would be about $120,000 to $150,000 minimum.

722
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:32,663
Speaker 0: Probably.

723
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:33,872
Speaker 1: So...

724
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:37,250
Speaker 0: You need at least just $60,000 to pay the salary of the game designer.

725
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,430
Speaker 1: Yes, a game designer.

726
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:38,867
Speaker 0: For a year.

727
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,370
Speaker 1: A dedicated game designer who is an experienced game designer.

728
00:46:43,114 --> 00:46:43,600
Speaker 0: Right.

729
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,410
Speaker 0: That's half the money.

730
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:49,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then contracting out art and then extensive play testing.

731
00:46:49,363 --> 00:46:51,910
Speaker 1: Play testing that takes longer than the game design, maybe.

732
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:55,190
Speaker 0: Yeah.

733
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:55,751
Speaker 0: Yeah, one more.

734
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,475
Speaker 0: This actually reminds me of one more thing.

735
00:46:57,695 --> 00:47:03,307
Speaker 0: So, in Netrunner, they have the draft, which is like you buy cards.

736
00:47:03,347 --> 00:47:04,630
Speaker 0: It's sort of like in Magic Drafting.

737
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:04,921
Speaker 0: Yeah.

738
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,190
Speaker 0: You buy cards, you open them, you pass them around like Seven Wonders and then you play.

739
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:14,290
Speaker 0: So, they charge money for this and it's not the one, the official draft is not very good and it costs a lot of money to play.

740
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,599
Speaker 0: So, it's very hard to get people to do it.

741
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:19,190
Speaker 0: We did it once and that was sort of it, in New York at least.

742
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:32,130
Speaker 0: So, what some people do is they make a cube, which is the thing people have done in Magic where it's like make your own, you know, draft, you know, pile of cards and pass it around and everyone will draft out of that.

743
00:47:32,752 --> 00:47:33,915
Speaker 0: And that way we don't have to pay money.

744
00:47:33,956 --> 00:47:38,510
Speaker 0: We just take cards you already own, put them in a pile and we can have all the fun of drafting without whatever.

745
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,140
Speaker 0: And I was like, the guy's like, "Oh, yeah, my cards are all...".

746
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,824
Speaker 0: I get into a discussion with a dude.

747
00:47:44,845 --> 00:47:46,469
Speaker 0: He's like, "Oh, you don't, why don't you want to play the

748
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:46,750
Speaker 0: cube?".

749
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:51,604
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Dude, it's basically the same thing we're talking about here.

750
00:47:51,644 --> 00:47:52,708
Speaker 0: It's a game made by a

751
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:53,049
Speaker 0: player.".

752
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:58,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, Netrunner wasn't made by the player, but this cube is like, "How do you know your cube is balanced?

753
00:47:58,465 --> 00:47:59,608
Speaker 0: What kind of rules you got for this

754
00:47:59,688 --> 00:48:00,009
Speaker 0: cube?".

755
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,629
Speaker 0: He's like, "Oh, but it's been made by, you know, Magic players have been doing this for a long

756
00:48:03,669 --> 00:48:03,830
Speaker 0: time.".

757
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:04,633
Speaker 0: It's like, "I don't care.

758
00:48:04,653 --> 00:48:06,921
Speaker 0: You know, the card selection, how much have you play?

759
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:07,423
Speaker 0: tested this?

760
00:48:07,443 --> 00:48:08,728
Speaker 0: You're basically asking me to be a play

761
00:48:08,748 --> 00:48:09,109
Speaker 0: tester.".

762
00:48:09,893 --> 00:48:13,430
Speaker 0: You know, but people really like doing it despite how crappy it is.

763
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, guys... The same people that like King's Forge.

764
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:16,612
Speaker 1: We will play.

765
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:20,043
Speaker 1: test your game either if you're a close personal friend or for money.

766
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,226
Speaker 1: We're not going to play.

767
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:22,430
Speaker 1: test your game at a con.

768
00:48:22,831 --> 00:48:27,745
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the guy brought his cube to the next Netrunner night.

769
00:48:27,765 --> 00:48:29,149
Speaker 0: He's like, "Does anyone want to play my

770
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:29,430
Speaker 0: cube?".

771
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,296
Speaker 0: And it was like, "Nope.

772
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:31,545
Speaker 0: No one wanted to play his

773
00:48:31,606 --> 00:48:31,827
Speaker 0: cube.".

774
00:48:33,793 --> 00:48:37,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did that panel, How to Win at Games.

775
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,630
Speaker 1: Remember how we talked about how if you understand games truly well, you ruin most games for yourself?

776
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:47,890
Speaker 1: If you get good at games, you're going to sound exactly like us about the 90% of tabletop games you ever play.

777
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:56,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I told that guy the story of Tribes 2 that basically let the players get what they wanted and Counter-Strike, which didn't let the players get what they wanted.

778
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:58,314
Speaker 0: He still was not convinced.

779
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:01,784
Speaker 0: He was just so adamant about his cube.

780
00:49:02,045 --> 00:49:03,670
Speaker 0: How his cube drafting was so great.

781
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:05,080
Speaker 1: Oh my god, his cube gate.

782
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,190
Speaker 1: You're denying him entry.

783
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:06,751
Speaker 0: I know.

784
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:08,094
Speaker 0: Cube Ghazi.

785
00:49:08,175 --> 00:49:09,217
Speaker 0: You can't say gate anymore.

786
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:10,701
Speaker 0: No gates allowed.

787
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:11,684
Speaker 0: It's all Ghazis now.

788
00:49:13,027 --> 00:49:14,110
Speaker 0: Only Ghazis allowed.

789
00:49:20,811 --> 00:49:23,057
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
