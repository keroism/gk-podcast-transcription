1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,691
Speaker 1: It's Monday, October 7th, 2013.

2
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:13,233
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:13,955
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,079
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,660
Speaker 1: Cooling small rooms filled with servers.

6
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:21,320
Speaker 0: Answer, wait till winter.

7
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,298
Speaker 1: Actually it's worse than winter.

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,938
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,800
Speaker 1: So I'm starting to realize something when it comes to this consumer level media equipment.

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:39,787
Speaker 1: Because remember when podcasting got really big in like 2005?

11
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:41,199
Speaker 0: When the iPod Nano came out.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,294
Speaker 0: And they added podcasts to iTunes.

13
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,080
Speaker 0: That's when it got big.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,260
Speaker 1: But then there were all these consumer level mixers started appearing.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,460
Speaker 1: But they at least had mostly the trappings of real mixers.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,120
Speaker 1: Like they had the same kinds of features, just much cheaper and not as well put together.

17
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:57,777
Speaker 1: But they were there.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,319
Speaker 1: But there were also those sort of podcasting appliances and podcasts for USB.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,123
Speaker 0: There were a lot of podcasts.

20
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:06,500
Speaker 0: It was mostly a lot of things like, what was that company?

21
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:07,764
Speaker 0: M-Audio.

22
00:01:07,824 --> 00:01:09,609
Speaker 0: They just made these interfaces.

23
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:13,500
Speaker 0: It was like, plug an XLR microphone into this interface and into your computer with a USB.

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,866
Speaker 0: Or, here's a microphone.

25
00:01:15,886 --> 00:01:20,560
Speaker 0: that's a big fancy microphone that's good for podcasting, but is just USB microphone.

26
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:21,799
Speaker 0: You plug it into your computer and talk.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,800
Speaker 1: But basically, because I knew audio, I kind of ignored all that stuff and used real equipment from the beginning.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,820
Speaker 1: And I know Scott knows a lot about computer audio as it pertains to surround sound and receivers and making all that work.

29
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:37,039
Speaker 0: He has talked about it.

30
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,120
Speaker 0: It's home theater knowledges, mostly.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,240
Speaker 1: But also the computer side of it.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,700
Speaker 0: But I know how to get a PC into a home theater, yes.

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,360
Speaker 1: And then I know the production, routing, mixers, aux whatevers, insert, TRS.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,760
Speaker 0: If you want me to set up your home theater in the most perfect way, I can do it as good as anyone on Earth can do it with any equipment.

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,300
Speaker 0: As long as you have the right shit and the right cables for mono price, I will charge, I don't know, a lot for that service.

36
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:02,820
Speaker 1: An unreasonable amount.

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you have to pay to get me to your house.

38
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:12,539
Speaker 1: But I've noticed something because Scott and I both bought the Elgato, which is this little device that you plug it into USB.

39
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,899
Speaker 1: I bought it for $10 more than you paid at PAX.

40
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,260
Speaker 1: No, actually $10 because it was still on sale on Amazon.

41
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:24,880
Speaker 1: It was cheaper on Amazon when I bought it than it was when you looked it up from the floor at PAX.

42
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,860
Speaker 1: But it was still more expensive than what you paid on the floor at PAX.

43
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,300
Speaker 1: And I did not get the free T-shirt and poster that you gave away to that kid.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,260
Speaker 0: That I did not need filling up my house into my garbage can.

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,700
Speaker 1: You gave one away to the kid and then the kid was a greedy little shit and wanted the other one too, so you gave it to his friend.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,300
Speaker 1: But anyway, Elgato works pretty well, but then we got this rig as well, which is a headset that we'll talk about later.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,279
Speaker 1: And looking at how both of these things work, I realized something kind of profound that should have been obvious, but I hadn't really thought about it until just now.

48
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,560
Speaker 1: Most people, because now there's a big push, kind of like how podcasts had this push, streaming video games seems to be the thing now.

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:03,937
Speaker 0: Well, Twitch.

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,800
Speaker 0: It's been the thing for a while.

51
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,060
Speaker 1: But it's starting to ramp up in that people who weren't doing it before are starting to do it.

52
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:13,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly, and there's a lot of interest in it.

53
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,140
Speaker 0: As soon as you do it, then it's a trend, you trendsetter you.

54
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:16,654
Speaker 0: No, no.

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,720
Speaker 0: It wasn't a trend already and you're bandwagoning.

56
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,140
Speaker 0: You're not, you're always leading the bandwagon, you're not getting on the bandwagon.

57
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,060
Speaker 1: I'm definitely on the trailing edge of this bandwagon.

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,380
Speaker 0: You are soundly in the middle of the bandwagon.

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,860
Speaker 1: Middle, I'm on the back end of it.

60
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,340
Speaker 0: Four wheels are surrounding your butt.

61
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,120
Speaker 1: I'm not saying on the trendsetter, I'm saying the opposite.

62
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,339
Speaker 1: I'm saying this trend was going and it's starting to get bigger, and what's happened...

63
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,479
Speaker 0: Too many people in the wagon with you now, hipster.

64
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:39,926
Speaker 0: Nah.

65
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:40,579
Speaker 0: Gotta get out.

66
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:47,700
Speaker 1: My problem is this, the technology that people are using to do this stuff is by and large

67
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:48,843
Speaker 0: pretty

68
00:03:48,983 --> 00:04:09,900
Speaker 1: poorly designed with terrible use cases, and it's almost like people who are into gaming wanted things to support their gaming streaming, but don't know the right way to do any of these things and solve the problems as they perceive them rather than doing what, I don't know, real video and audio professionals have been doing for decades.

69
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:23,340
Speaker 0: Right, well it's like, look, most people use OBS, which is Open Broadcaster Software, which is this free open source thing that basically you run it, it looks at your screen, right, takes those images, encodes them, and streams them.

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,299
Speaker 0: That's what it does.

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,719
Speaker 0: And XSplit does a similar thing, but XSplit costs money.

72
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:31,160
Speaker 0: OBS is free, open source, whatever.

73
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,140
Speaker 0: But it's kind of buggy, sometimes it doesn't work.

74
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,319
Speaker 0: Sometimes XSplit is buggy and crashes, right?

75
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:40,260
Speaker 0: And that seems to be the method the vast majority of people use for streaming.

76
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:51,516
Speaker 0: When people, and people really mostly only stream PC games or emulated games on their PC using this method, and there's really no other method available to 99% of people.

77
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,099
Speaker 0: I mean, friggin' even SaltyBet uses this kind of thing.

78
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:03,059
Speaker 1: Like here's my example, the Elgato has HDMI in, HDMI out, so you put it in stream, and then like in your video stream.

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:16,340
Speaker 0: Elgato is the only way that somebody, the only way I know of, consumer product wise, that someone can stream their Xbox or PS3 or Wii or something like that directly without having fancy equipment that they won't have.

80
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,560
Speaker 0: It's like the affordable, consumer-friendly solution to that problem, which is why I have it.

81
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:29,220
Speaker 1: But the kinds of issues it has, like it just doesn't recognize all the interfaces on professional audio equipment, so you have to use ghetto audio equipment with it.

82
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,079
Speaker 0: Well that's the problem in the software, actually.

83
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:40,700
Speaker 1: Exactly, because the kinds of people who are using these things by and large don't know a lot about this stuff, and it's really geared toward them.

84
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:43,380
Speaker 1: And if you have a complex use case, that has a lot of issues.

85
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,220
Speaker 1: And also, basic stuff, like if you unplug it, it just stops displaying your stream.

86
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:50,107
Speaker 1: Like it blocks your TV.

87
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,160
Speaker 1: Not even just the local device, it also blocks the TV itself.

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:06,731
Speaker 1: But it's the same way with the rig, this headset, because as Scott pointed out, it has two interfaces, a USB interface, and then an eighth-inch stereo interface, so it can receive audio from two sources, and send audio from one.

89
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:21,115
Speaker 0: Right, the whole point of that is so that you can go into the Skype options, or the Ventrilo options, or the TeamSpeak options, and say, "Hey, you take your microphone input from USB, and your audio output to

90
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:21,235
Speaker 0: USB.".

91
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:27,737
Speaker 0: And then you go to the game you're playing, and you say, "Hey game, send your audio output of this game to the

92
00:06:27,777 --> 00:06:28,160
Speaker 0: speakers.".

93
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:41,580
Speaker 0: That way, you could use the hardware slider on the rig to basically make your friends on Skype louder, or TeamSpeak louder, and the game quieter, or vice versa, and sort of mix between the two, and that's why there's two interfaces.

94
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,660
Speaker 1: But why the eighth-inch stereo to plug into your other sound card?

95
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,360
Speaker 1: Why isn't it just one USB with two interfaces in it?

96
00:06:49,780 --> 00:07:06,500
Speaker 0: Because that would cost more, and then the mixer wouldn't be this sort of, you know, that mixer that they're using is probably a cheap analog thing inside that hockey puck, whereas if it was two interfaces, that mixing would have to happen digitally, which means there would have to be more processing power in the rig itself to do that.

97
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:18,540
Speaker 1: But also, looking at the way it interfaces with Xboxes, with these pass-throughs and things, the kinds of cables that it wants you to connect to things really just make it look kind of pathetic next to any real equipment.

98
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:19,260
Speaker 0: Of course.

99
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:21,479
Speaker 1: So I've been having this issue lately.

100
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,100
Speaker 0: Buy real equipment.

101
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:32,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the high end, a lot of the higher-end equipment, the software in games just doesn't deal with it well.

102
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:33,359
Speaker 0: Of course not.

103
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:41,614
Speaker 1: Try to use a FireWire interface 8 out of 17 as your microphone input for a game, and a lot of games will be like,

104
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:41,919
Speaker 1: "What?".

105
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:50,039
Speaker 0: And now you know this is even the most basic thing that people go through when they set up those booths at conventions that have all those game systems, right?

106
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,239
Speaker 0: Think about the people that have the giant video screens or the video walls or the multi-monitor setups.

107
00:07:57,022 --> 00:08:04,100
Speaker 0: Every booth you've seen at PAX where tons of crazy computers set up in all these weird ways, playing demos, it's crazy.

108
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,719
Speaker 0: And then they have little servers for the LAN inside the little booth.

109
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:13,180
Speaker 0: This is the entry level of the kind of problems those people face.

110
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,421
Speaker 0: But it's

111
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:26,239
Speaker 1: one of those things where a lot of the people who try to do audio production or podcasts or a little studio, they set up their mixers and everything, and I was looking at forums for both the rig and the Elgato to answer some questions, because the documentation is kind of sparse.

112
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:30,300
Speaker 1: And I saw the kinds of questions the average users of these are asking.

113
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,039
Speaker 0: They have no clue of anything that's going on.

114
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:35,039
Speaker 1: And it really makes it clear why the software is the way it is.

115
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:49,980
Speaker 1: But I see a lot of people, they'll rig up all these cables plugged in all over the place to do some sort of audio thing that could have been done entirely in their software they already have if they just knew to right-click on the mixer in Windows.

116
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:51,408
Speaker 0: Yep.

117
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:52,500
Speaker 0: People don't know how to use that shit.

118
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:52,880
Speaker 1: Yep.

119
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,572
Speaker 1: Which has been a theme in Geek Night since about 2002, 20 out of five.

120
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,708
Speaker 1: So you got any news?

121
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,820
Speaker 1: It's a Monday.

122
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:02,820
Speaker 0: Why don't we talk about-- It's not the lounge.

123
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, why don't we talk about Adobe losing all their passwords and shit.

124
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,744
Speaker 1: Oh, Adobe.

125
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:08,575
Speaker 1: Usually I make fun of this.

126
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,500
Speaker 1: We both make fun of this.

127
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:12,694
Speaker 0: This happens a lot, and it never happens to anywhere.

128
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:13,900
Speaker 0: I have a username and password.

129
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:17,959
Speaker 1: So now it happened to something we use, and our friend Conrad pointed this out.

130
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:24,200
Speaker 1: The reason this one sucks in particular is because it's not like there's another option.

131
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,659
Speaker 1: It's not like there's another company that makes software like this.

132
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,580
Speaker 1: Like what am I going to do if I don't like the fact that they have kind of bad security?

133
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,791
Speaker 1: Stop doing things?

134
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:36,300
Speaker 1: Stop doing my job?

135
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:37,343
Speaker 0: Yeah.

136
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:39,840
Speaker 0: You're sort of stuck with Adobe no matter what.

137
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,400
Speaker 0: They got Ye Olde Monopoly, sort of like the cable company on South Park.

138
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,140
Speaker 1: An old, poorly secured database.

139
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,212
Speaker 1: I don't understand how this keeps happening.

140
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:52,620
Speaker 0: How is your database-- I mean, we have at work, we got MySQL databases.

141
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,839
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure no one can get into them.

142
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,140
Speaker 0: Unless it was an inside job, how would you get in there?

143
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then again, this is databases--.

144
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:07,360
Speaker 1: Remember, these systems are accessible to the outside with their Adobe updaters and their account management.

145
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,940
Speaker 0: Why is your database directly accessible without some sort of layer of application between it and the world?

146
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:15,100
Speaker 1: That application itself is probably what was compromised.

147
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,698
Speaker 1: A lot of times there'll be a customer portal and someone does some sort of attack to get that portal to start dumping records one by one.

148
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,400
Speaker 0: Why did you write your portals so shittily?

149
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,919
Speaker 1: Because there's literally no incentive to write them better.

150
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:31,440
Speaker 1: This in no way affects Adobe.

151
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:33,739
Speaker 0: Only if they didn't have Monopoly it would.

152
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:39,320
Speaker 1: Even if they had Monopoly, the average user of these things does not care at all.

153
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,955
Speaker 0: They probably just go, "Damn it, I gotta change my

154
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:41,460
Speaker 0: password.".

155
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,640
Speaker 1: I mentioned this at work, and nobody even knew it happened.

156
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,859
Speaker 1: People who pay for Adobe.

157
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,219
Speaker 0: People don't read the internet.

158
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:51,880
Speaker 1: I did not get an email from Adobe, so my account wasn't compromised.

159
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,940
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're doing wrong, Scott.

160
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:57,360
Speaker 0: We talked last time, I think, about the Google Glass.

161
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:58,860
Speaker 0: Is that Google Glass?

162
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:04,520
Speaker 0: People have been saying that more lately, and my response is-- Wait, they've stepped up their game.

163
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,199
Speaker 1: They've gone from, "Ugh," to, "They recognize that Google Glass is a

164
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:08,360
Speaker 1: thing.".

165
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,736
Speaker 0: They say, "Is that Google

166
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:09,978
Speaker 0: Glass?".

167
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,979
Speaker 1: No, so they know the term, "Google

168
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:13,180
Speaker 1: Glass.".

169
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,018
Speaker 0: Sure, and my response lately has been, "What else could it

170
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:16,239
Speaker 0: be?".

171
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:17,907
Speaker 0: And they're sort of like,

172
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:19,217
Speaker 0: "Oh.".

173
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:23,040
Speaker 0: It's like, "I don't know, maybe some other company was making a thing.

174
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,470
Speaker 0: I don't know what Google Glass looks

175
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:24,813
Speaker 0: like.".

176
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,859
Speaker 0: You said that people don't read internet.

177
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,471
Speaker 0: Read internet.

178
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:30,120
Speaker 0: Join.

179
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:37,680
Speaker 0: Otherwise, basically, as soon as you confirm to me that you don't read internet, I now view you as a 20th century person.

180
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,179
Speaker 0: I'm a 21st century person, and you don't fit in with me.

181
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,639
Speaker 1: Oh, look at all the provincial plebs.

182
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,380
Speaker 0: Look at all the old people.

183
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,453
Speaker 0: "Oh, you're only 18, you don't read

184
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:47,775
Speaker 0: internet?".

185
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:48,360
Speaker 0: Old person.

186
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:50,225
Speaker 0: Read internet.

187
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:52,139
Speaker 0: That way you'll know what the fuck is going on.

188
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,640
Speaker 1: Thing is, you didn't know about what does the fox say.

189
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:58,540
Speaker 0: That is not as important.

190
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,509
Speaker 1: Not as important?

191
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,280
Speaker 1: Who are you to judge?

192
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,340
Speaker 0: There are plenty of things I know about that you don't know about on internet.

193
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:04,168
Speaker 1: Alright.

194
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:05,239
Speaker 1: Name one.

195
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:07,419
Speaker 1: Alright, let's go.

196
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,280
Speaker 1: We need to play some sort of game of back and forth until someone fails.

197
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:13,536
Speaker 1: So there's a mutual fail.

198
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,960
Speaker 1: Maybe we should do that as its own episode.

199
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,240
Speaker 0: Did you know about the pink flags in the NFL?

200
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:23,160
Speaker 1: I imagine it has something to do with breast cancer.

201
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:24,325
Speaker 0: Yeah.

202
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:26,319
Speaker 0: But you don't know what the deal is.

203
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:30,780
Speaker 1: Do they just throw a pink flag every time someone goes to second base on the field?

204
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:31,791
Speaker 0: Second base?

205
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:32,520
Speaker 0: It's not baseball.

206
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:36,195
Speaker 1: So there's something you don't know.

207
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:40,957
Speaker 0: Second base on the field?

208
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:41,140
Speaker 0: Okay.

209
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:42,696
Speaker 0: Let's move on.

210
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:45,110
Speaker 1: Gonna try to steal home?

211
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:46,160
Speaker 1: Is that what you're going for now?

212
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:48,776
Speaker 1: We made Emily laugh.

213
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:49,019
Speaker 1: I win.

214
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,260
Speaker 1: So, unrelatedly, there's a lot of NSA news and you guys really should be reading that stuff too.

215
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,046
Speaker 0: Haven't we gone over that?

216
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:58,860
Speaker 0: We went over that news before it even happened.

217
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:01,940
Speaker 1: When I was in high school...

218
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,225
Speaker 0: Go look to the Geek Nights Archive.

219
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:06,680
Speaker 0: How many episodes can you find where we talk about that sort of shit?

220
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:16,180
Speaker 1: Dude, if you know the kinds of BBS's I used to post to when I was in middle school, and you go to them, you'll see me complaining about basically what the NSA is doing today.

221
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:25,299
Speaker 1: So, one of these secret court orders, this is a specific tiny thing related to the NSA that I think you should all be really aware of.

222
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,523
Speaker 1: LavaBit.

223
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:29,059
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't even know what LavaBit is.

224
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,054
Speaker 1: LavaBit does secure communication stuff.

225
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:32,820
Speaker 1: Cool, but it did.

226
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,600
Speaker 0: It was a place where you could get a super secure email account where everything was encrypted and it was awesome.

227
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:38,871
Speaker 0: And anonymous.

228
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:39,700
Speaker 1: Run by cool people.

229
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,640
Speaker 0: You can't get it anymore.

230
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,560
Speaker 1: So, they got one of those secret court orders where they had to do stuff and if they said anything, jail.

231
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,300
Speaker 0: So what he did is he just shut it down and he said "I'm shutting it down" and he didn't say anything else.

232
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:57,740
Speaker 1: So, eventually, he won a victory in court and he was able to, and it's complicated how he did this.

233
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,754
Speaker 0: Didn't the EFF help him or something?

234
00:13:58,795 --> 00:13:59,059
Speaker 1: I don't know.

235
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,804
Speaker 1: Someone helped him.

236
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:02,139
Speaker 1: I'm skipping all the political stuff and just get to the tech part.

237
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,929
Speaker 1: So, basically, he won disclosure.

238
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:07,660
Speaker 1: The ACLU did straight up help him here.

239
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,260
Speaker 1: So, apparently, the FBI had demanded that they turn over their root SSL certificate.

240
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:23,300
Speaker 1: That has serious implications if that's the kind of thing that these secret court orders are demanding.

241
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,812
Speaker 1: Because the people who are served them have basically no way to fight back.

242
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:41,640
Speaker 1: and I won't blame anyone who, if their choice is "my life is fucked forever" or "I give the encryption keys for all of my users over to the government secretly", I'm not going to fault anyone who does the latter.

243
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,857
Speaker 0: Okay, so here's the thing.

244
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:47,340
Speaker 1: But I will not blame you that much if you buckle down.

245
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,658
Speaker 0: I do not fault someone for complying with the court order and not having their life fucked.

246
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:52,100
Speaker 0: I agree.

247
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:54,279
Speaker 0: But I do fault him in another way.

248
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,480
Speaker 1: The fact that he was going to hand it over anyway?

249
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:57,116
Speaker 1: No.

250
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,420
Speaker 1: Okay, because there's a lot more to the story.

251
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:08,300
Speaker 0: When you make an SSL certificate or when you make an SSH key, you can encrypt it with a passphrase.

252
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:13,119
Speaker 0: If it is encrypted with a passphrase, this is known law, even I know this law, right?

253
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,680
Speaker 0: That if the government has warrants and all that stuff that they need, they can say "give us the key to your house" and you give them the key.

254
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,100
Speaker 0: But if it's a combination safe and they say "give us the combination", you say "Fifth Amendment" and give them the finger, right?

255
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:26,205
Speaker 0: Same thing.

256
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:27,515
Speaker 0: They say "give us the SSL key".

257
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:28,139
Speaker 0: Here you go.

258
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,731
Speaker 0: "Tell us the password to decrypt the SSL key".

259
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:32,200
Speaker 0: Fifth Amendment, give them the finger.

260
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:36,940
Speaker 0: If you didn't put a password on your SSL, then house secure was lava bit, really, to begin with.

261
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,232
Speaker 0: So they didn't do something so basic.

262
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:39,080
Speaker 0: So basic.

263
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:47,680
Speaker 1: So the more sad implication is that with secret court orders, what if they say "also give us the password or we'll fuck you"?

264
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,440
Speaker 0: I say Fifth Amendment, here's my fingers.

265
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,187
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what if they just arrest you?

266
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:51,589
Speaker 1: What do you do?

267
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:52,595
Speaker 1: You can't fight it legally.

268
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:53,380
Speaker 0: If you speak up?

269
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,688
Speaker 0: If I have my Fifth Amendment, I'm going to keep using it.

270
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,900
Speaker 0: Once I've gone down that road, I can't not go down that road.

271
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,368
Speaker 1: Now he did a bunch of awesome things along the way.

272
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:04,340
Speaker 1: He complied by printing it out.

273
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:05,899
Speaker 0: That's also cool.

274
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:07,679
Speaker 1: He printed it out and he handed it to them.

275
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I printed it out, handed it to them, and don't tell them the passphrase at the same time.

276
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,060
Speaker 1: Yep, and the FBI complained.

277
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:19,780
Speaker 1: "To make use of these keys, the FBI would have had to manually input all 2,560 characters..." Without error.

278
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,779
Speaker 1: "Yes, and one incorrect keystroke in this laborious process would render the MVI system incapable of collecting decrypted

279
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:28,080
Speaker 1: data.".

280
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:30,234
Speaker 0: I would use OCR to get it in there.

281
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:32,384
Speaker 1: I didn't read it fully.

282
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:36,380
Speaker 1: The court order didn't necessarily say, specifically hand over the keys.

283
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:40,538
Speaker 1: It said, "Give us the capability to read all your users'

284
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:40,980
Speaker 1: traffic.".

285
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,247
Speaker 0: Fifth Amendment, here's my fingers.

286
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,272
Speaker 0: Why don't you smell them?

287
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:44,580
Speaker 0: Why don't you pull them?

288
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,990
Speaker 1: You're not incriminating yourself.

289
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:48,720
Speaker 1: You're giving data on other people.

290
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:49,959
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

291
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,310
Speaker 0: Yeah.

292
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:54,560
Speaker 1: Now, here's the implication.

293
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,160
Speaker 0: But what if I can be convicted of aiding and abetting them by providing this system?

294
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,179
Speaker 0: Then I would be implicating myself, at least based on just logic and not based on necessarily law that I don't know.

295
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,520
Speaker 0: No.

296
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,606
Speaker 1: We're not lawyers.

297
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,008
Speaker 1: We're just.

298
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,675
Speaker 0: If someone listening to this thinks that I'm a lawyer...

299
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,939
Speaker 1: Godspeed to you, good sir.

300
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,877
Speaker 0: Here is my legal advice to you.

301
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:34,540
Speaker 0: Rob a bank once in a town far away from where you live, tell someone you're going on vacation like Europe, go to Kansas, rob a bank in a complete covering your entire body head to toe in black, and then never go back, launder the money through bitcoins or some shit like that.

302
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:43,380
Speaker 1: Scott, as your lawyer, I'm going to advise you that that is a terrible option because, one, advice my dad gave me is when I was young, never rob a goddamn bank.

303
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,878
Speaker 0: Rob a restaurant when...

304
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,189
Speaker 1: You'll do it once in a federal prison.

305
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:47,640
Speaker 0: Two, there's not any money in there.

306
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,900
Speaker 0: Rob a restaurant when the armored car is about to pick up the money.

307
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,511
Speaker 1: Not a restaurant.

308
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:53,600
Speaker 1: Not a sit-down restaurant.

309
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,378
Speaker 0: A big time, yeah.

310
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,140
Speaker 1: Because sit-down restaurants all get paid in credit cards and charge cards.

311
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:04,240
Speaker 1: You want to rob a submarine shop or a burger joint or a place that deals mostly...

312
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,240
Speaker 0: A popular place like a Shake Shack.

313
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,420
Speaker 1: That deals mostly in cash, lunch crowd, and you want to figure out when their armored car comes and come the day before.

314
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,381
Speaker 0: Yep.

315
00:18:12,402 --> 00:18:21,293
Speaker 0: Also, if the armored car comes and he's got like four boxes on a trolley of cash, take one of the boxes and run, he won't abandon four boxes to go rescue one of them.

316
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,740
Speaker 0: He's got to stay with those four.

317
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,240
Speaker 0: And make sure you have a friend nearby...

318
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:25,780
Speaker 1: Who grabs the other one?

319
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:32,400
Speaker 0: If he's stupid and it bans those four boxes, he grabs the whole trolley, you drop the one box that you had and keep running.

320
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:34,136
Speaker 1: Okay, that's our legal advice, but...

321
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:34,620
Speaker 0: Yes.

322
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:39,740
Speaker 0: And then live your whole rest of your life on that money and never commit a crime again because once there's a pattern, they'll get you.

323
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:46,880
Speaker 1: The point of this is that this is why you should really think about your encryption workflows if you're the kind of person who cares about encryption.

324
00:18:47,120 --> 00:19:01,013
Speaker 0: If you actually care about encryption, we've talked about it a lot on the show before, the one thing I'll just say, which is always the rule, is if you want the encryption to actually work and keep the feds out and keep other people out, it's going to be at least a little bit, probably a lot of hassle.

325
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:03,060
Speaker 0: You have to be willing to deal with that hassle.

326
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:05,162
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

327
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:10,740
Speaker 1: But in this case, the worrying part is that the government is actually going after private keys...

328
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,759
Speaker 0: Then they can ask for whatever they want.

329
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're probably going to get it because of these secret bullshit court orders.

330
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:26,958
Speaker 1: Anyway, things of the day!

331
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:30,186
Speaker 1: I'm a fan of a few Robin Hood movies.

332
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:31,830
Speaker 1: I like Men in Tights.

333
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,889
Speaker 0: Your favorite one's a Disney one, isn't it?

334
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:37,221
Speaker 1: I really like the Fox Disney one.

335
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:38,886
Speaker 1: Well, literally, he's a fox.

336
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:39,950
Speaker 1: You're all furry.

337
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,642
Speaker 1: I like that one, but I don't know if it holds up.

338
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,050
Speaker 1: I've not seen it since I was very young.

339
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:51,930
Speaker 1: I liked, when I was younger, the Robin of Locksley Robin Hood Men of Thieves one with Kevin Costner.

340
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,209
Speaker 1: I don't know if that one holds up, though.

341
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,094
Speaker 0: I don't know.

342
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:57,630
Speaker 0: There's so many of them, I can't even separate them in my mind anymore.

343
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,058
Speaker 1: That was the one that made Robin Hood popular again.

344
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:01,604
Speaker 1: That was a big deal.

345
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,350
Speaker 1: That movie was huge when it came out.

346
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,993
Speaker 1: But I don't know if it holds up.

347
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:09,790
Speaker 1: There's one Robin Hood that I don't think many of you have watched, and it turns out the entire thing is on YouTube.

348
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:11,699
Speaker 1: This is the 1922 Silent Robin Hood.

349
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,564
Speaker 0: Well, isn't that Public Domain?

350
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,537
Speaker 0: 1922?

351
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:16,925
Speaker 1: I think so.

352
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,653
Speaker 0: 1922.

353
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:20,921
Speaker 1: It's online, remastered.

354
00:20:21,182 --> 00:20:23,210
Speaker 1: The quality is better than you would expect.

355
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:25,749
Speaker 0: It looks really good.

356
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,243
Speaker 0: A lot of films from that era were lost, but not that one.

357
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:29,330
Speaker 0: That one was a big deal.

358
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:34,318
Speaker 1: The first comment on YouTube is "Made Mary and His

359
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:34,679
Speaker 1: Butters.".

360
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,970
Speaker 1: So, now I gotta watch this and see what they're talking about.

361
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:38,608
Speaker 0: Okay.

362
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:41,730
Speaker 1: Wow, the comments are actually all-.

363
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,930
Speaker 0: That could mean so many things, there's so many Butters episodes.

364
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:44,441
Speaker 1: I know.

365
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:50,450
Speaker 1: $5 says that everybody that was in this film, along with the production team and the directors, are probably dead by now.

366
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,630
Speaker 0: Maybe when that guy says Butters, he doesn't mean the South Park character, he means something else.

367
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:56,248
Speaker 1: I can't imagine anything else.

368
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,070
Speaker 0: Urban Dictionary for Butters.

369
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:00,430
Speaker 1: I don't want to look at Urban Dictionary for Butters.

370
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:01,069
Speaker 0: I'm going to.

371
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,669
Speaker 1: You're going to, because I'm not going to.

372
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:03,395
Speaker 0: Okay.

373
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,410
Speaker 0: You just keep talking.

374
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:05,870
Speaker 1: Now, you can watch this movie.

375
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:07,730
Speaker 1: I have not watched it yet.

376
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,089
Speaker 1: I would like to watch it, but I will warn you.

377
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,910
Speaker 1: It is 2 hours, 12 minutes, and 56 seconds long.

378
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,908
Speaker 1: And it is a silent film.

379
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,019
Speaker 0: Okay, so.

380
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,821
Speaker 0: Urban Dictionary #1, Butters.

381
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,910
Speaker 0: A sweet little boy from South Park.

382
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,129
Speaker 0: He's so stupid and cute, don't you just want to hug him?

383
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:24,706
Speaker 1: I do.

384
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:28,430
Speaker 0: #2 for Butters on Urban Dictionary.

385
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:29,590
Speaker 0: Ugly.

386
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,060
Speaker 0: Don't fancy yours much.

387
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:32,209
Speaker 0: She's well Butters.

388
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,450
Speaker 1: I guess it's short for Butterface.

389
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,950
Speaker 0: This means ugly when used to describe a person.

390
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,810
Speaker 0: I think it comes from Butterface.

391
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:38,968
Speaker 1: That's what I would assume.

392
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,782
Speaker 1: Alright, I'm looking for Maid Marian in here.

393
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:41,669
Speaker 1: now, I can't find her.

394
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,530
Speaker 1: Oh, she's cute if that's Maid Marian.

395
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:45,550
Speaker 1: I assume that's Maid Marian.

396
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,710
Speaker 1: No, no, that's her stoop- yep, that's not her.

397
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,030
Speaker 1: That's the woman who was the chicken in the Disney one.

398
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:53,532
Speaker 0: Oh.

399
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,309
Speaker 1: I know them by their animal type.

400
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:56,949
Speaker 0: Sure.

401
00:21:57,471 --> 00:21:58,929
Speaker 1: Anyway, what do you got for me?

402
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:03,410
Speaker 0: So, uh, it's Monday, we like programming, we like games.

403
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,190
Speaker 0: Here's this website, Puzzlescript.net.

404
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,870
Speaker 0: And what Puzzlescript.net lets you do is on the left side, you can code.

405
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,530
Speaker 0: And on the right, it makes a puzzle game from your code.

406
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:20,509
Speaker 0: And it basically lets you code puzzle games, straight in the browser, and share the puzzles with people.

407
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:26,950
Speaker 0: And it's actually kind of really cool and pretty easy, but also for reals programming, not some bullshit.

408
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:29,390
Speaker 0: where like, you know, there's a GUI and you program in the GUI.

409
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,950
Speaker 0: And it sort of makes those kind of puzzles that are like Lolo-ish.

410
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:35,009
Speaker 0: You know, where you walk around and push things.

411
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:37,490
Speaker 0: It basically makes that kind of puzzle, like a Lolo style.

412
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,810
Speaker 1: Lolo one was good, two was good, three's kind of shit.

413
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,430
Speaker 0: Hey, if you don't know Lolo, go grab your NES emulator.

414
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,189
Speaker 1: Just play Lolo.

415
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,630
Speaker 0: Play Lolo, you can just figure it out, you don't need instructions.

416
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,169
Speaker 0: You can read instructions online if you really need help.

417
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:53,850
Speaker 0: That is a puzzle game that holds up big time.

418
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,790
Speaker 1: That was a puzzle game for all time.

419
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,750
Speaker 1: Lolo in Lolo 2, Lolo 3 is some bullshit because there's some timing-based puzzles.

420
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,790
Speaker 0: Dude, that shit is crazy hard.

421
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,930
Speaker 0: I mean... Two Two Rockets got nothing on Lolo.

422
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,230
Speaker 1: Well, Two Two Rockets was more of a Twitch game.

423
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it also had puzzle factor of knowing what the fuck to do.

424
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I only ever played Two Two Rockets in four player multiplayer.

425
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,470
Speaker 1: Because that is the only way to play that game.

426
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,530
Speaker 0: The single player's kind of puzzling.

427
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, forget that.

428
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:19,530
Speaker 1: Four player multiplayer.

429
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,200
Speaker 1: That shit is bananas.

430
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:22,530
Speaker 1: B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

431
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:22,802
Speaker 0: Sure.

432
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:25,810
Speaker 1: So, in the meta moment, the Book Club book is Stazzyland.

433
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,329
Speaker 1: I assume Scott is going to finish it soon.

434
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,209
Speaker 1: It's kind of short.

435
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,800
Speaker 0: I haven't read it since that.

436
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:31,529
Speaker 0: one time I read it.

437
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:36,350
Speaker 1: In the time that you have not read it, I've read like four more E&M Banks books.

438
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:39,290
Speaker 1: For real.

439
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,710
Speaker 1: I also read Catching Fire.

440
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:46,190
Speaker 0: Not that I couldn't have read them, but I've just been doing all these other things instead.

441
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, what's the whole point of this?

442
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:48,367
Speaker 1: Read a book?

443
00:23:49,451 --> 00:23:49,802
Speaker 1: Kids read?

444
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:51,910
Speaker 0: If you would pick a book, I felt like reading.

445
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,810
Speaker 1: So you don't care about overreach of government surveillance?

446
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:57,543
Speaker 0: I do, I just don't.

447
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,230
Speaker 0: Not motivated to read non-fiction, really.

448
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,670
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you realize it's going to be all non-fiction.

449
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,730
Speaker 0: Fine, I'm going to get the most possible fiction.

450
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:08,610
Speaker 1: What could you possibly pick that I would not enjoy?

451
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,358
Speaker 0: Super fiction.

452
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:10,250
Speaker 0: It's like double fiction.

453
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:11,530
Speaker 0: It's as fiction, you know.

454
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:18,390
Speaker 1: There's only one book in the world you could pick that I probably would not enjoy, but I would read anyway, read quickly, and then give you shit about it.

455
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:22,636
Speaker 1: That would be the third book in the Mr.

456
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:23,790
Speaker 1: Nice Guy's Penis Adventures.

457
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:28,470
Speaker 1: We should just read The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss.

458
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,410
Speaker 0: Berenstain Bears.

459
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:35,668
Speaker 1: So get this, the CTO of my company totally is reading The Kingkiller Chronicle and likes it.

460
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:40,797
Speaker 1: I know this because he told me about tabletop and all this PAX stuff.

461
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:41,929
Speaker 1: He's like, "Yeah, you go to PAX, right?

462
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:44,370
Speaker 1: I heard Patrick Rothfuss was there.

463
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:44,634
Speaker 1: Holy

464
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:44,961
Speaker 1: shit.".

465
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:48,119
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Oh yeah, Mr.

466
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,363
Speaker 1: Nice

467
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:48,707
Speaker 1: Guy.".

468
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:50,349
Speaker 0: Some people seem to really like him.

469
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,790
Speaker 0: And his penis adventure.

470
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:57,069
Speaker 1: If you haven't read that book club book, seriously, it's a nice guy going around with his dick.

471
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:00,149
Speaker 1: That's pretty much the plot.

472
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,550
Speaker 1: And I guess there's a king who gets killed.

473
00:25:03,653 --> 00:25:06,609
Speaker 0: It's a book where the fedora is the most powerful guy in all the land.

474
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:07,635
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

475
00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:10,169
Speaker 1: He was born in a fedora.

476
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:11,026
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

477
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:14,561
Speaker 1: We've got video on the internet.

478
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:15,430
Speaker 1: We've got our forum.

479
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,210
Speaker 1: If you want to join the forum, email us because we turned off.

480
00:25:19,473 --> 00:25:20,483
Speaker 0: Even that's not working.

481
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:22,888
Speaker 0: I sent someone an invite who asked for it.

482
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:24,850
Speaker 0: Only one person has asked in that time period.

483
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:28,970
Speaker 0: And I sent them the invite and they clicked on the link in the invite and there was a server error.

484
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,059
Speaker 1: Dude, we had the vanilla guy on the show once.

485
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,109
Speaker 1: Why don't we call him and be like, "Yo,

486
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,553
Speaker 1: dog."

487
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:35,290
Speaker 1: He won't help us because they're not paying money.

488
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:41,349
Speaker 0: So to get this problem solved, basically, we had to give vanilla a lot of monies.

489
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,614
Speaker 0: Which is why I asked on the forum if anyone wants to pay.

490
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:46,368
Speaker 0: We'll figure it out.

491
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:48,440
Speaker 0: Give us time.

492
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,230
Speaker 0: It's becoming more of an issue slowly.

493
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,623
Speaker 0: It wasn't a big deal before.

494
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:53,310
Speaker 0: It's entropy.

495
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,300
Speaker 1: But give us time.

496
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,089
Speaker 1: The reason we're slow on fixing that is that we've been doing a ton of video.

497
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,278
Speaker 1: We're streaming stuff.

498
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:00,710
Speaker 1: We have resumed production of Geek Nights Presents.

499
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,723
Speaker 1: In fact, I've got an episode.

500
00:26:02,986 --> 00:26:05,529
Speaker 1: I've got Premiere open right now.

501
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,654
Speaker 1: And I see I'm making a funny face.

502
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:11,453
Speaker 1: Scott's got his ring finger out and he's kind of stroking it.

503
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:12,368
Speaker 1: There's the Sea King.

504
00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:15,550
Speaker 0: Let's check the calendar this weekend.

505
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,995
Speaker 0: New York Comic Con, we're not going?

506
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:21,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, not only are we not going, I kind of want to do a show on why we're not going.

507
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,034
Speaker 0: Oh, whatever.

508
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,270
Speaker 0: Next weekend after that, Burning Con 2013.

509
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,569
Speaker 1: I'm running the most creatively titled session ever.

510
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,640
Speaker 0: The Pentaclegon.

511
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:32,490
Speaker 1: Let Sleeping Dogs Die.

512
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:35,129
Speaker 0: Also, a ton of Netrunner tournaments in New York.

513
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:41,710
Speaker 0: Then nothing else really on the calendar until Magfest.

514
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,804
Speaker 0: In New Year's.

515
00:26:47,197 --> 00:26:47,926
Speaker 1: Oh, it didn't clip.

516
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:48,189
Speaker 1: Yes.

517
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,149
Speaker 1: This picture is so great.

518
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,917
Speaker 1: That was a raw... That did not clip and yet it was raw.

519
00:26:54,937 --> 00:26:57,389
Speaker 1: I'm not compressing the signal at all on the inserts.

520
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:00,290
Speaker 1: Anyway, so yeah, follow all our stuff.

521
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:07,018
Speaker 1: If you like our videos and want us to make more of them faster, get them linked to on things and popular.

522
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:12,734
Speaker 0: If suddenly we become really popular and someone gives us money or something, maybe we could even host the forum somewhere better.

523
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:29,628
Speaker 1: I mean, one of you kids linked to our anime... Oh, we reviewed all that anime before it came out and one of you linked to it on Reddit and it got like 10,000 views immediately and there was a great thread of a few fanboys mad about it and the silent majority very happy about it.

524
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:33,730
Speaker 1: Get that to happen to a few more videos and we might start doing video a little bit faster.

525
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:36,289
Speaker 1: We might fix the forum a little bit faster.

526
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,828
Speaker 0: Is there anything else to discuss?

527
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:38,825
Speaker 1: Not really.

528
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:47,630
Speaker 1: Geek night should be going pretty solidly for a while, though the first week of November I might be back in Istanbul and out of the way.

529
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,770
Speaker 0: Why don't you just move there already?

530
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,670
Speaker 1: Kind of Islamic in the government.

531
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,140
Speaker 0: Oh, is that a problem?

532
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:54,778
Speaker 1: Not a lot of free speech because of that.

533
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,930
Speaker 0: Oh, is that a problem?

534
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a problem in a lot of places in the world.

535
00:27:58,395 --> 00:27:59,267
Speaker 1: It's also a problem there.

536
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:00,609
Speaker 1: That's a shame.

537
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,503
Speaker 1: Can't really bike there.

538
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:03,150
Speaker 1: No biking.

539
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,989
Speaker 1: Biking just doesn't happen there.

540
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:07,009
Speaker 1: Weather's nice, though.

541
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:09,130
Speaker 0: If there's nice weather, why can't you bike?

542
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:11,549
Speaker 1: You can't bike there.

543
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,490
Speaker 1: The roads are unbikable.

544
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:14,970
Speaker 1: No one bikes.

545
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,350
Speaker 1: In fact, I mentioned that I bike as a hobby and someone said that I couldn't even have.

546
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,649
Speaker 0: they must have bicycles.

547
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:23,189
Speaker 1: They know of bicycles.

548
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,741
Speaker 0: There has to be a bike shop in Istanbul.

549
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:31,750
Speaker 1: Yes, people will mountain bike, but nobody uses bikes to transport themselves in Istanbul.

550
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:33,410
Speaker 0: Istanbul on bike.

551
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,802
Speaker 0: Two tires, two continents.

552
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:36,033
Speaker 0: Let me read about this website.

553
00:28:36,094 --> 00:28:38,721
Speaker 1: Basically, the roads are death traps for bikes.

554
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:42,518
Speaker 1: There's no bike pads and the sidewalks are pretty much all cobblestone.

555
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:44,155
Speaker 0: This is all off-road type biking.

556
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:44,378
Speaker 1: Yes.

557
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,790
Speaker 1: If you want to bike in a city, one, you have to have a death wish.

558
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,710
Speaker 0: Bike tour of Istanbul.

559
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,329
Speaker 1: Yes, that would be not fun at all.

560
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:55,290
Speaker 0: Are there any companies?

561
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:56,630
Speaker 0: Okay, okay.

562
00:28:57,191 --> 00:29:00,098
Speaker 0: Are there any companies that do bicycle-led guided tours of Istanbul?

563
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:03,429
Speaker 0: I've done these in Amsterdam and Berlin with companies like this one.

564
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,794
Speaker 1: Okay, two of the most bikeable cities in the world.

565
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:10,279
Speaker 0: Answer number one, if I'm honest, I wouldn't feel like biking across Istanbul.

566
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:15,667
Speaker 0: It's a very hilly city with steep cobblestone streets in the older parts and a terrible traffic.

567
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,675
Speaker 0: Response two, I agree with Patara.

568
00:29:19,755 --> 00:29:22,626
Speaker 0: Even if someone is offering such a tour, I wouldn't do it.

569
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:28,010
Speaker 0: Answer number three, like others well said, Istanbul is a very hilly city.

570
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,210
Speaker 0: It would be very difficult to ride unless you're a good biker.

571
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,710
Speaker 0: There was no such service.

572
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,670
Speaker 1: What my friend said to me, and I'm going to quote them pretty directly, "Biking in Istanbul?

573
00:29:36,153 --> 00:29:36,560
Speaker 1: You would

574
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,946
Speaker 1: die.".

575
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:39,629
Speaker 1: That is exactly what he said.

576
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:42,647
Speaker 1: And then, "How do you bike in New

577
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:42,870
Speaker 1: York?".

578
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,943
Speaker 1: And I was like, "We have bike

579
00:29:43,963 --> 00:29:44,226
Speaker 1: lanes.".

580
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:46,769
Speaker 1: He was like, "Hahahaha, a bike lane.

581
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:48,850
Speaker 1: You mean a lane that's just for bikes?

582
00:29:51,016 --> 00:29:51,290
Speaker 0: Hahahaha.".

583
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:51,981
Speaker 0: Anyway.

584
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:52,550
Speaker 1: Anyway.

585
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:53,508
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

586
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,622
Speaker 1: A while ago, we did a show.

587
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,864
Speaker 1: We talked about HVAC and cooling and servers and things.

588
00:29:58,884 --> 00:29:59,693
Speaker 0: That was a long time ago.

589
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:00,946
Speaker 1: But I realized something.

590
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:01,855
Speaker 1: I realized a couple of things.

591
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:04,784
Speaker 1: One, I didn't learn any of this at RIT, really.

592
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:05,835
Speaker 1: Like, RIT kind of...

593
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:06,542
Speaker 0: You have to take it.

594
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,825
Speaker 0: You don't learn that in technology classes, right?

595
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:13,350
Speaker 0: You learn that in like, you know, vocational school or engineers, you learn it, right?

596
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,828
Speaker 0: Because engineers learn about heating and cooling.

597
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,525
Speaker 1: But yet, IT people need to know this stuff.

598
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:16,930
Speaker 0: Yeah.

599
00:30:17,744 --> 00:30:24,408
Speaker 1: And I learned other similar things, like cable management, wiring houses...

600
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,434
Speaker 0: It's not an architect would learn, right?

601
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:30,314
Speaker 0: There's like a crossover there between architects, engineers, you know, that sort of thing.

602
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:40,295
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like in IT, at RIT, I took classes where there were drywall walls and we had to cut for panels and run cables through them and do everything like you would in a residential building.

603
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,709
Speaker 1: Like, we did all that stuff.

604
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,716
Speaker 1: But for whatever reason, we didn't learn anything other than the bare-bone basis of HVAC.

605
00:30:46,736 --> 00:31:04,533
Speaker 1: So, I want to kind of take a page from some of the older how-to episodes we did and talk about a very specific problem in cooling that many of you young kids might run into going out into the industry out there like your first job in IT and how to solve it without fucking everything

606
00:31:04,553 --> 00:31:04,594
Speaker 0: up.

607
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:07,462
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you're not going to go from nothing to big data center.

608
00:31:07,503 --> 00:31:08,877
Speaker 0: And big data centers are all weird.

609
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:11,060
Speaker 0: They all do different things for the heating and cooling.

610
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:11,383
Speaker 1: Yep.

611
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:13,364
Speaker 1: And they already have something in place.

612
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:13,728
Speaker 1: Yeah.

613
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:14,879
Speaker 1: You just have to use it.

614
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:15,606
Speaker 0: Exactly.

615
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:17,204
Speaker 0: Like, look at what Facebook has in place.

616
00:31:17,224 --> 00:31:21,830
Speaker 0: They have like these ridiculous, like, giant, slow fans with this water.

617
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:23,668
Speaker 0: You can see a video on YouTube about it.

618
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,837
Speaker 1: But Scott's right.

619
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,577
Speaker 1: If you're in the job of designing the data center, you already know this stuff.

620
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:28,941
Speaker 1: Exactly.

621
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:39,485
Speaker 1: If you just get a job working at the data center, even if no one tells you anything, you can go there for the first time, go to your rack, look to the left and to the right, and there's two other racks that are set up correctly.

622
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:40,718
Speaker 1: Just do what they did.

623
00:31:41,002 --> 00:31:41,204
Speaker 0: Yep.

624
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:44,318
Speaker 1: Look at their rack and buy the same parts if you have to.

625
00:31:45,108 --> 00:31:59,264
Speaker 1: But the other reason I bring this up is that if you're an intern or a co-op or it's your first IT job, this is the kind of job that the people who already work at the company will give to you to fix because they don't want to deal with it and they don't care.

626
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:07,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually any company, right, no matter how big the company is, even if their stuff is in a data center, the office, every office has a server closet.

627
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:20,090
Speaker 0: Even if there's nothing in that server closet besides, like, the connection to the internet, the router, and a bunch of switches, there's still a closet, and most likely, I've never seen a case in my life where it was literally just the routers and switches.

628
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,826
Speaker 0: There's other stuff in there, right?

629
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:29,786
Speaker 0: Yep, it might be your phone system, it might be your Outlook cache, it could be, it could actually often be, like, the actual active domain servers.

630
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,260
Speaker 1: Or at least a copy of it.

631
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:31,604
Speaker 1: Right.

632
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:36,009
Speaker 0: Or there'll be some sort of firewall things, like those Barracuda things, or all kinds of...

633
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:37,059
Speaker 1: Don't buy those things, but I digress.

634
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,150
Speaker 0: I know, but there'll be lots of things.

635
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:44,938
Speaker 0: The things that are computers that are generating heat on a rack, right, that aren't just switches, not that switches don't make heat either.

636
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:50,510
Speaker 1: Now, also, many of you will be in the situation I'm in, I'm just gonna go through this exact situation.

637
00:32:50,994 --> 00:33:07,848
Speaker 1: You are pointed at a small server room that's in the office, it's got, I don't know, maybe ten or so servers in it, some telco equipment, maybe your, like, Fios business thing is in there, maybe there's some other equipment laying around, it's a little room, and you're in a building where it doesn't really have the best AC.

638
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:11,482
Speaker 1: So you've got this room with servers in it, and there's some matter...

639
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:14,612
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one puts the closet in, like, a really well air-conditioned room.

640
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:15,461
Speaker 0: It's a closet.

641
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:18,050
Speaker 0: They cram it in the tiniest space possible to save money.

642
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,279
Speaker 1: Often without the permission of the building itself.

643
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of these buildings, especially in New York, are old before the time of computers.

644
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:27,119
Speaker 0: There wasn't a room made for this stuff, right?

645
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:40,795
Speaker 0: You're just basically finding a closet, or even in a lot of cases, you'll just have, like, the person who's renovating the office just make two walls in a corner to create a box, and then they'll install a rack by screwing it into the floor, and there you go, it's a rack.

646
00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:48,835
Speaker 1: Now the final point, the room I'm gonna talk about is the kind of room where the servers in it are kind of important, but not that important.

647
00:33:49,118 --> 00:33:52,268
Speaker 0: Right, you're not, if your company is so dumb, they've put their, like,

648
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,158
Speaker 1: a lot of them

649
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,067
Speaker 0: are that dumb, yes, most, in fact,

650
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:56,370
Speaker 1: but

651
00:33:56,875 --> 00:34:02,210
Speaker 0: if your company's that dumb that your super essential data is pretty much in this room, and only in that room, you're in big trouble already.

652
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:04,529
Speaker 0: See episodes about backups and such.

653
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:17,420
Speaker 0: But, you know, you still, that room, it might not be the most important thing, like the end of the world if it fails, but it's still bad, if something happens to just routers and switches, no one in the office has internet.

654
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:19,261
Speaker 0: Good job, now no one can work.

655
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:19,688
Speaker 1: Yup.

656
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:23,119
Speaker 1: You know, imagine, there are jobs where that wouldn't stop you.

657
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,009
Speaker 1: Sure.

658
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,329
Speaker 1: I can't imagine having a job like that.

659
00:34:26,712 --> 00:34:29,684
Speaker 0: But in my office, if the internet goes out for too long, people just go home.

660
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:38,190
Speaker 1: If I lost internet connectivity, I would pretty much take my laptop down to Starbucks, and if it didn't get fixed within like an hour, I'd just go home.

661
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:38,958
Speaker 0: That's what we do.

662
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:44,170
Speaker 0: So, the situation, but I guess if your job is to fix that, you have something to do and you can't go home.

663
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,889
Speaker 1: So here's the situation I was confronted with.

664
00:34:46,190 --> 00:35:00,849
Speaker 1: Shitty old building, get to a new company, there's the system administrator leaves or whatever, but doesn't really matter, because everything's kind of going fine, and you have, all your stuff is not on those, no, you have system administrators dealing with the real servers that matter everywhere else.

665
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,913
Speaker 0: Yeah, the clouds, you know, data centers.

666
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:04,370
Speaker 1: But I'm confronted with a closet.

667
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,999
Speaker 1: The closet has a sign on it that says, and I quote, "Do not close this door ever under any

668
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,868
Speaker 1: circumstances.".

669
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:13,946
Speaker 1: It's printed and taped to the door.

670
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:14,370
Speaker 0: Uh oh.

671
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:15,924
Speaker 1: And it's loud in that room.

672
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:17,524
Speaker 1: It's loud and you hear it in the office.

673
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:18,010
Speaker 0: Uh oh.

674
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:23,080
Speaker 1: I peek my head in this room, and I see a rack with ten or so servers on it.

675
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,850
Speaker 0: Is the wiring nice?

676
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:25,426
Speaker 1: Oh, the wiring's acceptable.

677
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:25,770
Speaker 1: Okay.

678
00:35:25,932 --> 00:35:28,921
Speaker 1: It is, it is, it is not how I would wire things.

679
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:30,990
Speaker 0: That's usually the first sign though, right?

680
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:32,780
Speaker 1: It's the sign of competence.

681
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:44,899
Speaker 1: If you see a rack, and it's a rat's nest, back away slowly, or make it your job to fix it, because once you fix it, no one else will ever be able to touch it again.

682
00:35:45,485 --> 00:35:46,477
Speaker 0: Get a fluke first.

683
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:47,310
Speaker 0: Yeah.

684
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,940
Speaker 1: That was my job many years ago, and I am, it was except, kind of like with authors or writing.

685
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,438
Speaker 1: Like, there are books that are well written enough to be enjoyable.

686
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,598
Speaker 1: Like, uh, The Hunger Games.

687
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:01,850
Speaker 1: Perfectly well written.

688
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,608
Speaker 1: But, they don't, I do not appreciate their writing.

689
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:06,762
Speaker 1: They're merely functional.

690
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:07,409
Speaker 1: They are not good.

691
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,370
Speaker 1: This is wired functionally.

692
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,709
Speaker 1: It's fine, but it's no Hawthorne.

693
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:16,477
Speaker 1: It's no cavalier and clay.

694
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:17,610
Speaker 1: It's no prince of nothing.

695
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:19,347
Speaker 1: So, whatever.

696
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,618
Speaker 1: The wiring's fine.

697
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:32,718
Speaker 1: The room's fine, but it's got this huge black AC unit, just churning, and there's two rabbit ear sort of tubes coming out of the top of it, just going into the room.

698
00:36:32,778 --> 00:36:34,717
Speaker 1: Not going into the ceiling or anything, just going into the room.

699
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:35,970
Speaker 0: So, the air conditioner's doing nothing.

700
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:37,488
Speaker 1: Kind of, yeah.

701
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:39,869
Speaker 0: It's actually making the room hotter, in fact.

702
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:41,690
Speaker 0: So, despite the laws of physics.

703
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,942
Speaker 1: There's another consumer level air conditioner.

704
00:36:44,962 --> 00:36:45,548
Speaker 1: Okay.

705
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,101
Speaker 1: That also has two.

706
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,960
Speaker 0: Does people not know how air conditioners work?

707
00:36:49,445 --> 00:36:50,517
Speaker 1: Uh, I don't think most people do.

708
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:57,289
Speaker 1: That also has two of these rabbit ear tubes out of the top, running, and that one is running all the time.

709
00:36:59,132 --> 00:36:59,606
Speaker 1: All the time.

710
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:01,510
Speaker 1: And the door is held open.

711
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:07,389
Speaker 1: And I hear a story that one time, a long time ago, someone closed the door, and then the room overheated and the servers all crashed.

712
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:08,154
Speaker 0: Yeah.

713
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:12,568
Speaker 1: So, they have to leave the door open because the magic swirls make everything work.

714
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:14,638
Speaker 1: And I ignored it.

715
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:15,546
Speaker 1: Wasn't my job.

716
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:15,970
Speaker 1: Didn't care.

717
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:21,969
Speaker 0: You didn't just take one of the hoses on the black one and stick it, the hot hose, and send it out to where?

718
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:22,859
Speaker 0: To where?

719
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,489
Speaker 1: There's no window.

720
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,308
Speaker 1: Completely interior room.

721
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:26,614
Speaker 0: Oh.

722
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,109
Speaker 0: There's not like a duct you can cut a hole in?

723
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,140
Speaker 1: Uh, there could've been, but it hadn't been cut.

724
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,675
Speaker 0: You could've at least drag it so it's coming out the door.

725
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:39,040
Speaker 1: This is the first rule of IT.

726
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:41,361
Speaker 1: If it is not your job, don't fucking touch it.

727
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:44,494
Speaker 0: Just drag the hot hose so it shoots directly out the front door.

728
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:45,808
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

729
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,433
Speaker 1: I could do something like that, but you touch it, you own it.

730
00:37:48,534 --> 00:38:00,030
Speaker 1: If you get a job, if you're an intern, and you get hired at a company and they hire you for real, and you once set up their phone system, that is your job no matter what you do for the rest of your time at that company.

731
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:01,625
Speaker 1: You touch it, you own it.

732
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:04,416
Speaker 1: At least in small to mid-sized companies.

733
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,063
Speaker 0: Okay.

734
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:05,124
Speaker 0: So,

735
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:29,207
Speaker 1: if you're hired to do X, and you see problem Y, and it took me a long time in my own professional career to learn this, unless you really, really are invested in this company, and you have the clout to be able to disentangle yourself from it later, don't touch Y. Let whoever's doing Y do Y, and unless you were asked by the people who are your bosses to touch Y, just ignore it.

736
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:31,769
Speaker 1: So, I ignored this.

737
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:42,233
Speaker 1: And then the guy who had set it up, who apparently had just sort of inherited from another guy from another, you know, distant past, no one in the office currently really knew why it was set up the way it was.

738
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,940
Speaker 0: And no one knew how an air conditioner worked.

739
00:38:45,142 --> 00:38:48,069
Speaker 1: So, one day, it, uh, smelled smoke.

740
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:49,630
Speaker 1: There was some smoke.

741
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,022
Speaker 0: Of course.

742
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:56,781
Speaker 1: So, hello over there, and I see that the mini air conditioner, the outlet had caught fire.

743
00:38:57,025 --> 00:38:57,410
Speaker 0: Of course.

744
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,821
Speaker 1: So, I put the fire out.

745
00:38:59,002 --> 00:38:59,770
Speaker 0: With a fire extinguisher?

746
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:00,596
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

747
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:02,455
Speaker 1: I just kind of hit it, and then I unplugged it.

748
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:02,758
Speaker 1: Okay.

749
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,050
Speaker 1: It was like this smoldering fire.

750
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,220
Speaker 1: I stepped on it.

751
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,963
Speaker 0: So, that was the air conditioner that was actually doing something.

752
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:07,429
Speaker 0: Yeah.

753
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:09,830
Speaker 1: So, I decided I had to fix this.

754
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:21,449
Speaker 1: So, the first thing you need to know about air conditioners is that for a sealed room like this, which is usually where the server rooms go, you're not going to waste your corner office for servers, especially in New York.

755
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:28,462
Speaker 1: So, this server room is always going to be some interior room with probably no actual ventilation of any kind.

756
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:29,070
Speaker 0: That's a problem.

757
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,438
Speaker 1: There are two kinds of sealed room air conditioners.

758
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,469
Speaker 1: One of them has a single hose.

759
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,849
Speaker 1: Hot air blows out of this hose.

760
00:39:38,031 --> 00:39:38,395
Speaker 1: Yes.

761
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:41,203
Speaker 1: Those are bullshit air conditioners.

762
00:39:41,264 --> 00:39:43,405
Speaker 1: If you buy an air conditioner like that, you're fucked up.

763
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:43,850
Speaker 0: Yep.

764
00:39:44,191 --> 00:39:46,090
Speaker 1: Because they cause a negative pressure situation.

765
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:51,304
Speaker 1: If you put that in this room, just put it in the room, it's just going to slowly heat the room up.

766
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:55,102
Speaker 0: Yeah, the hot air will come out of that hose and heat up the room because it's an interior room.

767
00:39:55,364 --> 00:40:01,446
Speaker 0: You're supposed to use that one as a window, and you can throw that hose out the window, and thus sending the hot from the room out the window.

768
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:07,970
Speaker 1: Now, those systems still suck anyway, because let's say, let's assume, that I vent the hot air into the ceiling.

769
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,373
Speaker 1: Okay.

770
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:09,100
Speaker 1: I get rid of it.

771
00:40:09,464 --> 00:40:11,228
Speaker 0: And it's not going to come down, because hot air goes up.

772
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:12,735
Speaker 1: Wouldn't matter.

773
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:19,569
Speaker 1: I'd still be fucked, because this system, one, is now pressurizing the ceiling, unless it can get out somewhere, but let's ignore that for now.

774
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,888
Speaker 1: It's also depressurizing the room.

775
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:25,787
Speaker 0: Wouldn't it be depressurizing the ceiling and pressurizing the room?

776
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:25,889
Speaker 1: No.

777
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,624
Speaker 1: So it's exhausting.

778
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:28,696
Speaker 0: The room is cold?

779
00:40:28,898 --> 00:40:31,606
Speaker 1: Air is being forced out that exhaust tube into the ceiling.

780
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,432
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but hot air is lower pressure than the...

781
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:37,119
Speaker 1: No, no, it's air pressure from the fan, not the heat.

782
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:40,735
Speaker 0: But, yeah, you have a fan basically blowing out without any fans blowing in, right?

783
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:40,937
Speaker 0: Yes.

784
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:46,150
Speaker 1: So, much like a negative pressure case, the room you're air conditioning now, let's ignore the ceiling for a minute.

785
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,989
Speaker 0: Is sucking in the air from the outside room.

786
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,624
Speaker 1: From wherever it can get it.

787
00:40:49,745 --> 00:40:51,746
Speaker 0: Which is gonna be the hot air you just blew out.

788
00:40:51,806 --> 00:40:56,350
Speaker 1: So if you shut the door, it's gonna pull it through the cracks and pull that hot air right the fuck back into the room.

789
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:56,754
Speaker 0: That's right.

790
00:40:56,977 --> 00:41:01,505
Speaker 1: And if you leave the door open, you're basically trying to air condition your entire office now.

791
00:41:01,687 --> 00:41:01,910
Speaker 0: Yep.

792
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,262
Speaker 1: Instead of just that room.

793
00:41:03,343 --> 00:41:06,254
Speaker 1: And, yeah, that doesn't work because your office is probably big.

794
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:07,002
Speaker 1: Of course.

795
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:13,080
Speaker 1: Single hose air conditioners are useless in 95% of situations.

796
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:14,981
Speaker 1: Never ever buy them.

797
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:17,849
Speaker 0: It's good for your house if you want to air condition your whole house.

798
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:18,818
Speaker 1: It's terrible for your house.

799
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:19,689
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, your whole house.

800
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:20,312
Speaker 0: Right.

801
00:41:20,332 --> 00:41:20,959
Speaker 0: Your whole house.

802
00:41:21,302 --> 00:41:23,382
Speaker 1: But then how many of these units are you gonna need?

803
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:24,332
Speaker 1: Because one of those units...

804
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:26,634
Speaker 0: Well, remember Alex had that one monster one.

805
00:41:26,796 --> 00:41:28,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would not cool this apartment.

806
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:29,950
Speaker 0: No, not this apartment.

807
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:30,556
Speaker 0: Maybe mine.

808
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:31,182
Speaker 0: Work on mine.

809
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:33,101
Speaker 1: Maybe yours if you close the bedroom door.

810
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:35,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, I basically have two monster ones.

811
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:39,041
Speaker 1: You can go to websites and calculate how many BTU of cooling you need and all that.

812
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:39,850
Speaker 1: I'm not getting into that stuff.

813
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,700
Speaker 1: You can figure that out later.

814
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:44,555
Speaker 1: So I had to fix this now because I have a vested interest...

815
00:41:44,575 --> 00:41:46,169
Speaker 0: So you went to the internet to buy an air conditioner.

816
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,753
Speaker 1: Yeah.

817
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:50,717
Speaker 1: So first thing I did is I looked around the room and I looked at the big air conditioner that wasn't doing anything.

818
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:53,061
Speaker 0: That was just blowing both hoses into the room?

819
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:53,324
Speaker 1: Yep.

820
00:41:53,445 --> 00:42:01,103
Speaker 1: It was basically just a big fan circulating in the room and then the other air conditioner was blowing cold air into the servers and then hot air was coming out.

821
00:42:01,124 --> 00:42:05,768
Speaker 1: So it was keeping the servers kind of cool at the expense of everything else in the room, which is why it burned out.

822
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,303
Speaker 1: So here's how I fixed this situation.

823
00:42:09,464 --> 00:42:11,060
Speaker 1: One, I threw away the busted air conditioner.

824
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:11,970
Speaker 0: The one that was on fire?

825
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,171
Speaker 1: Yes.

826
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:13,303
Speaker 1: So now you have a room.

827
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:22,029
Speaker 1: Let's assume you bought or somehow got a two hose air conditioner, meaning one hose sucks air in, the other hose pushes air out.

828
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:30,899
Speaker 1: And then independent of that, there's a filtered intake that takes air from the room in, cools it, and puts the cool air back out into the room.

829
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:33,889
Speaker 1: Two completely independent cycles of air.

830
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,302
Speaker 1: Yep.

831
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:41,062
Speaker 1: So I found the interface for a drop ceiling for these hoses.

832
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:42,113
Speaker 1: I put it in the ceiling.

833
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:44,133
Speaker 0: Those are some long hoses.

834
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:46,618
Speaker 1: Yeah, the hoses are like 10 feet long.

835
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:47,184
Speaker 0: Oh, pretty good.

836
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:52,658
Speaker 1: So I route them to the ceiling and the top of this has a nice deflector unit.

837
00:42:52,982 --> 00:42:55,448
Speaker 1: So the intake is coming from one side, like eh?

838
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:58,538
Speaker 1: And then it's exhausting to the other side, the other direction.

839
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:03,470
Speaker 1: So it's going to heat up that area, but I don't know the pressure situation in this ceiling.

840
00:43:04,112 --> 00:43:05,470
Speaker 1: I poke my head up there.

841
00:43:05,892 --> 00:43:09,188
Speaker 1: It's pretty big and I feel I can get away with this.

842
00:43:10,112 --> 00:43:14,234
Speaker 1: So I set this up, I set the unit to cool, and I closed the door.

843
00:43:14,254 --> 00:43:15,810
Speaker 0: Closed the door?

844
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,269
Speaker 0: Did people freak out when you closed the door?

845
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:19,305
Speaker 1: Yes, people freaked out.

846
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:22,690
Speaker 1: So I took the sign and I put it on the fridge instead because I thought that was kind of funny.

847
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:28,076
Speaker 1: Later we got an intern who saw him.

848
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:37,770
Speaker 1: He went over to the fridge, he opened it, he closed the fridge after he got his drink, then he looked at the sign, then he kind of looked around like he wasn't quite sure what the deal was with the sign.

849
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:38,990
Speaker 0: Should I leave the fridge open?

850
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:43,874
Speaker 1: And then he walked away from it, so I considered that.

851
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:44,888
Speaker 0: That sounds like it's a good one.

852
00:43:45,988 --> 00:43:50,848
Speaker 1: So eventually, the unit shut itself down.

853
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:51,492
Speaker 0: What?

854
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:52,789
Speaker 0: Why?

855
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:57,089
Speaker 0: Oh, because it was cold enough and it has a thermostat.

856
00:43:57,854 --> 00:44:00,490
Speaker 1: So I got an SNMP trap because I set all that up too, duh.

857
00:44:01,694 --> 00:44:04,490
Speaker 1: So I go in there and I look because it said head pressure high.

858
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:09,249
Speaker 1: So sure enough, there's two things going on here.

859
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,277
Speaker 1: The ceiling is a closed pressure system.

860
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,769
Speaker 1: That full ceiling doesn't actually go anywhere.

861
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:20,730
Speaker 1: Except it goes a little bit into the drop ceiling of a neighbor's office.

862
00:44:22,274 --> 00:44:26,770
Speaker 1: So I learned later, he just kept turning his AC down because it kept getting really hot over there for some reason.

863
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,646
Speaker 1: He couldn't figure out why.

864
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:29,710
Speaker 1: But that's a separate thing.

865
00:44:31,274 --> 00:44:33,903
Speaker 1: The reason I had a high head pressure was for two reasons.

866
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:36,385
Speaker 1: One, the system was set up wrong.

867
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:38,062
Speaker 1: I should have looked at what the other people had set it to.

868
00:44:38,082 --> 00:44:43,790
Speaker 1: They set the temperature that the AC unit was striving for to be 60 fucking degrees Fahrenheit.

869
00:44:44,113 --> 00:44:44,537
Speaker 0: Okay.

870
00:44:44,861 --> 00:44:46,780
Speaker 1: So rookie mistake number one.

871
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,599
Speaker 1: If you ever set up an air conditioner for cool servers, you might think colder is better.

872
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:51,470
Speaker 1: That is not true.

873
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:52,759
Speaker 0: No.

874
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:53,810
Speaker 1: Cold enough is better.

875
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:54,392
Speaker 0: Yes.

876
00:44:54,412 --> 00:44:58,130
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter if the servers are, like, look at your computer's temperature.

877
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,970
Speaker 0: Is it 75?

878
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:00,557
Speaker 0: Is it 80?

879
00:45:00,557 --> 00:45:03,109
Speaker 0: Well, what temperature does the computer overheat?

880
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:05,831
Speaker 0: 100? 120?

881
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,719
Speaker 0: So if it's 90, the computer still works, right?

882
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,082
Speaker 0: Right?

883
00:45:09,163 --> 00:45:12,254
Speaker 0: Will the computer shorten its life or become damaged at 90?

884
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:12,557
Speaker 0: Well, no.

885
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:15,810
Speaker 0: Then why not 90?

886
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:19,164
Speaker 0: Why spend more energy to go down to 80 for no benefit whatsoever?

887
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:24,010
Speaker 1: So if you set an air conditioner too low, I've seen a lot of people do this in their houses.

888
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:25,489
Speaker 1: Oh, it's too hot in here.

889
00:45:25,952 --> 00:45:27,244
Speaker 1: And the air conditioner's already running.

890
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:29,770
Speaker 1: They'll turn the temperature all the way down on the air conditioner.

891
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,658
Speaker 1: That doesn't do anything.

892
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:31,062
Speaker 0: It does nothing.

893
00:45:31,203 --> 00:45:32,475
Speaker 1: Except eventually ruin your air conditioner.

894
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:33,989
Speaker 0: The air conditioner's either on or off.

895
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:37,690
Speaker 1: Well, the compressor, the condenser is on or off, independent of that anyway.

896
00:45:38,411 --> 00:45:46,816
Speaker 1: So I set that to a reasonable temperature, which for a server room like this, set it to somewhere between 76 and 78 degrees.

897
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:47,344
Speaker 0: Sounds good.

898
00:45:47,465 --> 00:45:48,523
Speaker 1: That is fine.

899
00:45:48,727 --> 00:45:48,890
Speaker 1: Yeah.

900
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:50,798
Speaker 0: So it was running all the time.

901
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:51,465
Speaker 0: That's what my computer is.

902
00:45:51,546 --> 00:45:52,354
Speaker 1: That was one problem.

903
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:57,181
Speaker 1: The second problem was that the hoses were directional.

904
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:01,323
Speaker 1: And whoever had put the hoses on, just put them on backwards when they set it up.

905
00:46:01,465 --> 00:46:02,334
Speaker 1: I didn't even look at that.

906
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:03,549
Speaker 0: They're not just plastic tubes?

907
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:05,790
Speaker 1: They're plastic expanding tubes, right?

908
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:07,260
Speaker 0: How could they be directional?

909
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,067
Speaker 0: They're just empty tubes.

910
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:11,015
Speaker 1: This is why I'm doing this show, because this shit isn't obvious.

911
00:46:11,055 --> 00:46:11,783
Speaker 0: I didn't know this.

912
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:15,015
Speaker 1: I only knew this because I dealt with this shit when I worked at that hospital.

913
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:19,850
Speaker 1: So a lot of those tubes are directional, because if you have a kinky tube that expands and contracts, right?

914
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:21,198
Speaker 1: You know those tubes.

915
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:21,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

916
00:46:21,742 --> 00:46:22,912
Speaker 1: If you collapse part of it...

917
00:46:22,933 --> 00:46:25,077
Speaker 0: It was already the tube I was imagining before you said anything.

918
00:46:25,097 --> 00:46:28,470
Speaker 1: So if you collapse it, what shape is that collapse thing on the inside?

919
00:46:29,471 --> 00:46:31,858
Speaker 0: Just a smaller circle than...

920
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,389
Speaker 1: Not quite, because it folds over on itself.

921
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:40,287
Speaker 1: So in one direction, it'll fold where the things... Say the air is blowing upward, right?

922
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:41,849
Speaker 1: And I put this thing on top.

923
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:46,050
Speaker 1: The folds, if you have it folded, will be aiming upward as well.

924
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,710
Speaker 0: So I'm imagining one that's just sort of like an accordion, and when you just squeeze it, it just gets narrower, basically.

925
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not how any of those things are like.

926
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,199
Speaker 0: Oh, they're not accordion-shaped?

927
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,390
Speaker 1: They're not just accordion-shaped.

928
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,389
Speaker 1: Because then, how would it kink and hold its shape?

929
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:02,010
Speaker 0: Oh, that kind!

930
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:02,714
Speaker 1: Oh!

931
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,940
Speaker 1: So, let's imagine I reverse this.

932
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:06,870
Speaker 1: I put the wrong tube on.

933
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:19,679
Speaker 1: So air is trying to blow out, and all the baffles from where it's folded are pointing down, and there's little... Basically, it causes these little crevices that will ridiculously reduce the amount of air that can be pumped through them at any given time.

934
00:47:20,164 --> 00:47:21,760
Speaker 1: Your efficiency will go to shit.

935
00:47:22,123 --> 00:47:24,890
Speaker 1: So if you buy an air conditioner, read the manual.

936
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:27,798
Speaker 1: It'll say something like, "This one goes out.

937
00:47:28,101 --> 00:47:28,808
Speaker 1: This one goes

938
00:47:28,909 --> 00:47:28,949
Speaker 1: in.".

939
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,349
Speaker 0: There weren't little arrows on the tubes?

940
00:47:30,636 --> 00:47:31,108
Speaker 0: There weren't.

941
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:33,867
Speaker 1: But you can tell by the shape.

942
00:47:33,907 --> 00:47:39,604
Speaker 1: If you don't have the documentation, just kink one, and then look at it and think, "What does this look like on the

943
00:47:39,644 --> 00:47:40,070
Speaker 1: inside?".

944
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:43,248
Speaker 1: And you will figure out which was the right one and which one's the wrong one.

945
00:47:44,211 --> 00:47:46,894
Speaker 1: So, I did that, and everything was 100% fine.

946
00:47:47,137 --> 00:47:47,440
Speaker 0: The end.

947
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,140
Speaker 1: That's all I had to do.

948
00:47:49,281 --> 00:47:49,950
Speaker 0: And you closed the door?

949
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,423
Speaker 1: I closed the door and left it closed.

950
00:47:51,443 --> 00:47:51,969
Speaker 0: And now you own it?

951
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:53,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, now I own it.

952
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:56,852
Speaker 0: What did people in the office... I guess all of them are dumber than you, 100% of them?

953
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,881
Speaker 1: No, they ignored it because it had been working fine.

954
00:47:59,349 --> 00:47:59,389
Speaker 0: Oh.

955
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:01,429
Speaker 1: No one touched it until it broke.

956
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:06,430
Speaker 0: But they didn't realize there was something wrong with just simply the fact that you couldn't close the door?

957
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,694
Speaker 1: Whoever originally set it up didn't know how this shit worked.

958
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,090
Speaker 0: And no one else even looked?

959
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:11,490
Speaker 1: No one else even looked in the room, because who cares?

960
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:16,857
Speaker 0: And there was a door that said, "Do not close ever," and it was making noise and bothering everyone?

961
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:17,970
Speaker 0: I consider that to be broken.

962
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,329
Speaker 1: It wasn't enough noise to really bother anyone, it's just I noticed it because I noticed that stuff.

963
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,667
Speaker 1: But, so I own it.

964
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,344
Speaker 1: So another problem happened.

965
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:28,582
Speaker 1: One day, I got a sensor warning that said humidity too high.

966
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:29,170
Speaker 0: Uh oh.

967
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,618
Speaker 1: So I go in there.

968
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,358
Speaker 0: The air conditioner doesn't dehumidify?

969
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:33,450
Speaker 1: Uh, it does.

970
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,310
Speaker 0: I mean, I've never seen an air conditioner that doesn't.

971
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:38,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what do air conditioners do with the water?

972
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:40,397
Speaker 0: They have a little hose that drops it outside.

973
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,126
Speaker 0: Not all.

974
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,910
Speaker 0: Onto passersby on the sidewalk.

975
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:47,021
Speaker 1: So, most of these dual hose conditioners don't do that.

976
00:48:47,082 --> 00:48:48,113
Speaker 0: Do they keep it in a little bucket?

977
00:48:48,397 --> 00:48:49,004
Speaker 1: No, they have a bucket.

978
00:48:49,024 --> 00:48:49,450
Speaker 0: And you empty it?

979
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,035
Speaker 1: They have a bucket.

980
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:52,397
Speaker 1: in case that has to be emptied sometimes, maybe.

981
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:55,308
Speaker 1: But what they actually do is use that hot air going out.

982
00:48:55,772 --> 00:48:57,249
Speaker 1: They evaporate it into that.

983
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:58,217
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

984
00:48:58,237 --> 00:48:58,925
Speaker 1: It's really nice.

985
00:48:59,106 --> 00:48:59,410
Speaker 0: Not bad.

986
00:48:59,751 --> 00:49:10,702
Speaker 1: The main big unit, however, removes so much humidity that it also has a pump that'll pump it out of this little tube and it'll pump it, you know, you can put it up into the ceiling over and down.

987
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:11,310
Speaker 0: Into a drain?

988
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:11,857
Speaker 1: Into a drain.

989
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:12,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

990
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, drain is good.

991
00:49:14,258 --> 00:49:16,070
Speaker 0: You send like a tiny hose to the bathroom.

992
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:16,735
Speaker 1: Exactly.

993
00:49:16,816 --> 00:49:17,302
Speaker 1: So we did that.

994
00:49:17,343 --> 00:49:18,255
Speaker 1: That was already set up.

995
00:49:18,315 --> 00:49:19,430
Speaker 1: It went through the ceiling, it was fine.

996
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,369
Speaker 1: So I got another S&P trap one day.

997
00:49:22,653 --> 00:49:26,358
Speaker 1: Water pan full and I go in there and the floor is just fucking flooded.

998
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:27,609
Speaker 0: How could that be?

999
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:29,813
Speaker 0: Where did the humidity come from?

1000
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:31,149
Speaker 0: Did someone like pee in it?

1001
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,850
Speaker 1: Well, this was during the height of summer.

1002
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,750
Speaker 1: So, basically, I do a little experimentation.

1003
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:38,781
Speaker 1: I look at this tube and I'm like,

1004
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:39,064
Speaker 1: "Huh.".

1005
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,170
Speaker 1: This tube goes into the ceiling and comes down.

1006
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:46,945
Speaker 1: I found an air duster and I stuck it into the tube and I blew and it was 100% clogged.

1007
00:49:47,227 --> 00:49:48,681
Speaker 0: Oh, that little hose got clogged.

1008
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:50,055
Speaker 1: So I ripped it out of the ceiling.

1009
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:52,649
Speaker 1: It was full of the most mold.

1010
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:54,539
Speaker 1: All the mold.

1011
00:49:55,064 --> 00:49:55,893
Speaker 0: So you got a new hose?

1012
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:57,790
Speaker 1: So I ordered a new hose on Amazon.

1013
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:58,897
Speaker 1: It came the next day.

1014
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:00,257
Speaker 0: What did you do before the hose showed up?

1015
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,702
Speaker 0: Was it just more water everywhere or did you turn the servers off?

1016
00:50:02,843 --> 00:50:06,439
Speaker 1: Oh, so if you unplug the thing, it knows "Oh, I can't

1017
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:06,681
Speaker 1: pump.".

1018
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,570
Speaker 1: So it just holds it until it gets full while evaporating.

1019
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:10,842
Speaker 0: So you just emptied the bucket by hand?

1020
00:50:11,226 --> 00:50:14,580
Speaker 1: So I emptied it once and then it was fine until I got a new hose.

1021
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:14,943
Speaker 1: Okay.

1022
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:17,267
Speaker 1: And then I put a new hose on and it was fine.

1023
00:50:17,428 --> 00:50:17,610
Speaker 1: Cool.

1024
00:50:18,196 --> 00:50:20,599
Speaker 1: But most people wouldn't think to actually check the hose.

1025
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,740
Speaker 0: I would not have checked the hose for clogs.

1026
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:23,750
Speaker 1: That's the first thing you do.

1027
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:31,310
Speaker 0: I would have gone to the other end of the hose and if I saw nothing coming out, maybe because I would have definitely checked the end of the hose to make sure water was coming out.

1028
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:39,067
Speaker 1: Now, had the connector been broken or something, or the hose had been clogged in a certain way, it would have detected it.

1029
00:50:39,671 --> 00:50:43,730
Speaker 1: But it basically pumped the water out but then the hose was busted.

1030
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:47,190
Speaker 1: so then it would squeeze its way back out the bottom of the hose and leak.

1031
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,689
Speaker 1: So learn how those hoses work.

1032
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:50,878
Speaker 1: Read the manual.

1033
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:57,366
Speaker 1: The manual will say something like, "The hose has a maximum lift of x and the hose diameter has to be...".

1034
00:50:57,386 --> 00:50:59,083
Speaker 1: It'll tell you all this stuff in the manual.

1035
00:50:59,124 --> 00:50:59,710
Speaker 1: Read that manual.

1036
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,599
Speaker 0: It's like a garden hose?

1037
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:01,831
Speaker 1: No, like a tiny hose.

1038
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:04,700
Speaker 1: The hose is like two or three millimeters.

1039
00:51:05,305 --> 00:51:05,790
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

1040
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,328
Speaker 1: If it was a garden hose that was clogged, what the fuck?

1041
00:51:10,594 --> 00:51:11,504
Speaker 1: So here's my problem.

1042
00:51:11,565 --> 00:51:13,689
Speaker 1: The unit, that unit eventually died.

1043
00:51:14,774 --> 00:51:16,964
Speaker 0: So you had to just turn all the servers off until you got a new one?

1044
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:20,196
Speaker 1: No, because I had bought a backup unit a long time ago.

1045
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:21,369
Speaker 1: Nah, there you go.

1046
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:26,135
Speaker 1: The backup unit is just a two-hose like what Alex has, a normal air conditioner.

1047
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:28,035
Speaker 0: Oh, so you basically got a crappy one.

1048
00:51:28,197 --> 00:51:35,289
Speaker 1: And I put it in the room and I set its temperature to like 80 with the fan always going and I put it in front of the rack.

1049
00:51:36,213 --> 00:51:41,529
Speaker 1: So that if anything went wrong, it'll at least be blowing cold air directly over the servers to keep them fine.

1050
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:52,598
Speaker 1: And it turns out, because that old unit had been a legacy unit, that this backup unit was more than capable of keeping the entire room and all the servers cool on its own.

1051
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:55,024
Speaker 1: That other unit was way over provisioned.

1052
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:56,055
Speaker 1: So I just didn't replace it.

1053
00:51:56,357 --> 00:51:56,660
Speaker 0: Okay.

1054
00:51:57,407 --> 00:52:00,074
Speaker 1: The moral is learn this stuff and kind of just wing it.

1055
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:07,772
Speaker 1: And I think if you remember all the problems I ran into from this episode, you're unlikely to run into different problems from that.

1056
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,230
Speaker 0: You will definitely run into a different problem.

1057
00:52:09,432 --> 00:52:20,178
Speaker 0: But one thing you can do that's an option for the small server room that is often unexplored is to completely seal the server rack in and air condition just that box.

1058
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:20,703
Speaker 1: Yup.

1059
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:22,665
Speaker 1: And do it all ghetto with cardboard boxes.

1060
00:52:22,746 --> 00:52:23,150
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1061
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:28,501
Speaker 0: If your room is no good and you can't get a good room, just seal the servers in somehow.

1062
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,390
Speaker 0: Make it an airtight.

1063
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:29,997
Speaker 0: seal around.

1064
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:31,090
Speaker 0: Doesn't need to be super airtight.

1065
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,988
Speaker 0: Just as airtight as your PC case is.

1066
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:33,672
Speaker 0: Right?

1067
00:52:33,854 --> 00:52:35,350
Speaker 0: Just around all the servers.

1068
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,098
Speaker 0: Even just a door on the front and back of the rack or something.

1069
00:52:38,563 --> 00:52:42,989
Speaker 0: And then you can just use fans and just maybe an air conditioner connected just to that.

1070
00:52:43,554 --> 00:52:44,888
Speaker 0: And that'll just take care of everything.

1071
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:50,970
Speaker 0: And though the room might be hot or the office or whatever, but at least the servers will never screw up or anything.

1072
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:57,109
Speaker 1: But if you run into a problem that I didn't cover, really if your job is to fix this kind of thing.

1073
00:52:57,352 --> 00:52:59,897
Speaker 0: A rat bit the hose that the water was going through.

1074
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:07,918
Speaker 1: Just go look and apply the same problem solving skills you apply to software and networks to the physical device.

1075
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:10,628
Speaker 1: Being a handyman, it's not like it's magic knowledge or being an HVAC.

1076
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:11,636
Speaker 1: It's not magic.

1077
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,333
Speaker 1: It's just look at the problem.

1078
00:53:13,636 --> 00:53:14,181
Speaker 1: Huh?

1079
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:18,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, HVAC guy unless he owns his own HVAC business makes less money than we do.

1080
00:53:18,424 --> 00:53:20,830
Speaker 0: It's because his skills are not that special.

1081
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,283
Speaker 0: It's something you can learn.

1082
00:53:22,344 --> 00:53:26,808
Speaker 1: Well, the skill so the higher order skills are special, like figuring out the air pressure differentials.

1083
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:30,507
Speaker 0: I'm talking about HVAC guy who like, you know, installs your central air conditioner outside your house.

1084
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:30,729
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1085
00:53:30,971 --> 00:53:31,233
Speaker 0: Right?

1086
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,555
Speaker 0: It's like I could learn to do that if I pick one up.

1087
00:53:34,686 --> 00:53:36,969
Speaker 1: But just apply basic problem solving skills.

1088
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:38,381
Speaker 1: This stuff's easy to fix.

1089
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:49,513
Speaker 1: And if you're an IT guy and you just fix these problems as the intern and it all just starts working perfectly, people will think that you're the most ridiculously competent IT guy ever.

1090
00:53:49,554 --> 00:53:50,079
Speaker 1: And you're set.

1091
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:56,040
Speaker 0: Well, also, even if they don't think highly of you, they will might hate you because you have shamed them.

1092
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,678
Speaker 0: It's like they had that door open all that time and you're like, Look, I shut the door.

1093
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,182
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1094
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:00,950
Speaker 1: Don't call attention.

1095
00:54:02,257 --> 00:54:02,908
Speaker 0: Oh, you're stupid.

1096
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,140
Speaker 1: Don't be stupid.

1097
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,323
Speaker 1: Don't be like a closed motherfucking door.

1098
00:54:06,363 --> 00:54:08,262
Speaker 1: Just be like, I fixed it and don't say anything else.

1099
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:09,919
Speaker 1: It's like I got the rooms fine.

1100
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:10,827
Speaker 1: It's all taken care of.

1101
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,415
Speaker 1: And that's the kind of stuff you have to be able to do, especially if you someday work for a small company or a non tech company.

1102
00:54:17,435 --> 00:54:18,268
Speaker 1: But you're the tech guy.

1103
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:21,636
Speaker 1: Tech guy also has to deal with electrical problems.

1104
00:54:21,879 --> 00:54:26,730
Speaker 1: Tech guy also has to deal with air conditioners and water pipes and all that stuff.

1105
00:54:27,191 --> 00:54:28,161
Speaker 0: Everything tech guy.

1106
00:54:28,262 --> 00:54:32,449
Speaker 1: If you're the tech guy for a non tech company, you're gonna have to deal with all that stuff.

1107
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,007
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1108
00:54:39,048 --> 00:54:44,020
