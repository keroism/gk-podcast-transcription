1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:09,720
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:11,869
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, April 3rd.

3
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:12,811
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 1: I'm rim and now for something completely different Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:36,038
Speaker 0: I've discovered the secret of the train the secret of space the secret of the train.

6
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,212
Speaker 0: you see Looking at you know.

7
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:43,779
Speaker 0: There's a problem taking commuter trains into New York City and that there are other people on these trains.

8
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:54,333
Speaker 0: and There is an interesting social problem where different people have different degrees of comfort With other people and as a result a lot of times people.

9
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,359
Speaker 0: it's kind of like in a urinal in a men's bathroom.

10
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,778
Speaker 0: people do Everything they can to not have to sit next to another human being.

11
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:01,919
Speaker 0: They'll like sit apart from each other.

12
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:14,098
Speaker 0: Like if you if you don't a stop-motion or just like you watch as time went on train cars fill up Pretty much every single seat will have one person in it before a single person sets next to sits next to anyone else

13
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,092
Speaker 1: unless they're People were together to begin with.

14
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:21,013
Speaker 1: like, you know Like someone gets on the train with their wife they'll sit next to each other.

15
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:23,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but on the morning commute, that's pretty rare.

16
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,360
Speaker 0: I mean, I did that back when we rode our bikes to the train station every morning together.

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,435
Speaker 0: But now that I take the 530 train, I don't think that's happening anymore.

18
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:32,378
Speaker 1: No, not gonna happen.

19
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,967
Speaker 0: But Today this morning.

20
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:41,614
Speaker 0: I was thinking cuz next week at my job I'm actually giving a two-hour lecture on game theory and one of the like.

21
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:51,020
Speaker 0: the moral of my lecture is that Game theory can be applied to real life intuitively And you don't need to know the math so much as need to be able to intuit the you know.

22
00:01:51,262 --> 00:01:55,000
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I was thinking about alright Here's the situation.

23
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:05,299
Speaker 0: I'm getting on the train getting a good seat because I the one fear that has Come to pass many times in my life since I started working in the city is that dude sits next to me?

24
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's always bad.

25
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,991
Speaker 1: or get on the train like at the last second.

26
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:12,098
Speaker 1: All the seats are filled with people.

27
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:18,660
Speaker 0: or Someone sits next to me is really smelly or someone sits next to me with a wide leg spread.

28
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:22,511
Speaker 0: Yep, but I mean otherwise, I'll generally just sit right next to people.

29
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,400
Speaker 0: So I thought alright, let's look at this logically.

30
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:28,247
Speaker 0: How can I like what's my utility?

31
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:32,900
Speaker 0: My utility is the most space for me without anyone else mucking it up.

32
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:34,830
Speaker 1: That's what everyone else is thinking.

33
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,520
Speaker 1: Also, that's why they don't sit with anyone.

34
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:36,797
Speaker 0: Yes.

35
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:46,751
Speaker 0: But then I thought how can I maximize that and I tried something that I've never really seen anyone else do at least Not often, so there's two-seaters and three-seaters a lot of people.

36
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:55,600
Speaker 0: their strategy is they'll sit in the aisle of a two-seater Hoping that no one will have the courage to ask them to stand up so they can sit in the seat by the window.

37
00:02:55,686 --> 00:03:00,132
Speaker 1: No No See a two-seater or a three-seater is probably gonna end up with two people.

38
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:00,754
Speaker 1: no matter what.

39
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:04,708
Speaker 1: the three-seater is a safer bet Because you know someone will.

40
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,274
Speaker 1: you'll sit on the way the window seat.

41
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:07,760
Speaker 1: someone will take the aisle in the middle.

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,198
Speaker 1: 99 out of 10 times will never get filled.

43
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:13,980
Speaker 0: Yep Now there's nice social engineering where what they did on a lot of the trains it didn't work.

44
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:22,415
Speaker 0: So well is the two seats next to each other in the three-seater have a headrest But the seat on the end doesn't hoping that people would kind of slide over.

45
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,804
Speaker 0: people don't slide over But I did the other day.

46
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:32,700
Speaker 0: They would rather go without a headrest than I did the other day and someone got so uncomfortable They got up and walked away and left me with a three-seater by myself.

47
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:42,756
Speaker 0: this was kind of the inspiration because I was looking and I wanted a headrest cuz I had my pillow I was gonna take a nap and I see that there's a whole bunch of three-seaters with one person in.

48
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:43,620
Speaker 0: I'm sitting by the window.

49
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:46,048
Speaker 0: So I just sat right next to one of those people.

50
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,539
Speaker 0: So I also got a headrest and the guy Sat there for a minute and then he's like, excuse me, and he got up and he went to another seat.

51
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:58,729
Speaker 0: All right, so I realized something and this morning I got in the middle of a three-seater.

52
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:03,089
Speaker 0: I sat in the middle of a three-seater and No, one guy was like, excuse me.

53
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,052
Speaker 0: Can I sit there?

54
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:05,779
Speaker 0: And I was like, yeah sure, but I didn't slide over.

55
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:09,051
Speaker 0: And then he kept standing there.

56
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,319
Speaker 0: I was like, oh do you want the window instead?

57
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:20,418
Speaker 0: And then he like he didn't know what to do and he walked away and sat next to some lady and the lady gave me An evil look because I don't think she wanted anyone sitting next to her.

58
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:24,635
Speaker 0: But then on the way home, I tried the same thing and it worked again.

59
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:26,702
Speaker 0: the same thing happened Really?

60
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:32,200
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone will sit next to you if you sit in the middle of a three-seater unless the train is crazy crowded.

61
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,089
Speaker 1: See that's not a bad strategy, especially if it works.

62
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:37,296
Speaker 1: however, I have found one better strategy.

63
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:38,700
Speaker 1: That is the the ultimate strategy.

64
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,023
Speaker 0: Well, the ultimate strategy is to be really smelly No, no, no.

65
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:47,100
Speaker 0: or to sit in the end of a four-seater facing the right way exactly.

66
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,700
Speaker 1: You sit in a four-seater where the two seats are facing each other.

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:05:00,464
Speaker 1: It's a two two-seaters facing each other and you just sit in one of them and you get all this leg room and as long As no one sits directly in front of you You're just fine.

68
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:04,518
Speaker 0: a lot of times someone will sit directly in front of it can happen and then you're screwed.

69
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,788
Speaker 0: cuz then It's the worst.

70
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:11,474
Speaker 0: your knees You're basically between all the guys legs and that other guy has a knee between your legs.

71
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:19,800
Speaker 1: going for the four-seater is the ultimate Gamble because you could either end up in the best possible comfort infinite legroom or in the worst possible comfort.

72
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:26,220
Speaker 0: So I think of course some trains have the three-seaters that face each other.

73
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,700
Speaker 1: That's like in a couple cars, I don't know what's going on.

74
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,373
Speaker 0: It's like randomly in the middle of the nice cars We don't get because the third rail doesn't go all the way up here.

75
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:34,500
Speaker 0: all have that.

76
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:35,528
Speaker 0: I know those cut.

77
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:36,900
Speaker 0: those are like luxury cars.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,196
Speaker 0: I almost I almost miss working in Yonkers just because I could take that luxury train.

79
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,300
Speaker 1: I know it's not fair.

80
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:46,547
Speaker 1: Well, you couldn't take it the whole way, but you can think of some of the way I could take it a little under half.

81
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,219
Speaker 1: We can just move to Croton Harvin and take the luxury train.

82
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,699
Speaker 1: I don't know less money.

83
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:58,640
Speaker 0: So I have to go look at the rest of Croton Harvin because I've spent There have been many times where I was stuck in Croton Harvin with a lot of time to kill just because I've seen a pro.

84
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,167
Speaker 1: In Harman is a road a big parking lot a big train Train repair facility.

85
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:07,334
Speaker 1: there is nothing and some houses.

86
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:12,232
Speaker 0: There is not a single Place of business that is not shady and scuzzy.

87
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:15,364
Speaker 0: looking within walking distance of that train station I've looked.

88
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,279
Speaker 0: I walked many many moons.

89
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:28,240
Speaker 1: many Imagine if we did live within driving distance of that train station that we would Be a significant further distance from the train station than we are from our trains.

90
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,360
Speaker 0: Yes, I would rather have a slightly longer commute where I spend the entirety of it asleep or watching Avatar.

91
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:39,820
Speaker 0: Mmm, it's like I could drive to Croton Harman and then get on a train and it is faster.

92
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,366
Speaker 0: I've looked like it would be faster.

93
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:42,109
Speaker 0: Really?

94
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wonder how is it to drive to Croton Harman?

95
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:48,736
Speaker 0: It's I used to drive past Croton Harman every day when I drove to Yonkers.

96
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:52,139
Speaker 0: Wow, okay You know what driving there is really fast.

97
00:06:52,944 --> 00:07:00,300
Speaker 0: In fact, you could be in Yonkers in an hour Not even an hour a lot less than an hour if you sped, you know the shortcuts there.

98
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,394
Speaker 0: There's no like traffic accident or anything.

99
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:02,837
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

100
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,137
Speaker 0: But anyway, I've learned the secret of the train and all it took was actually thinking.

101
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:11,560
Speaker 0: All right What's the best way with my limited options?

102
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:17,660
Speaker 0: There's only like 10 different places I can sit maybe 11 if I count sitting in the vestibule or a bathroom.

103
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:18,764
Speaker 0: Yeah, the bathroom.

104
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:19,366
Speaker 0: That's the.

105
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:21,574
Speaker 0: if you don't have a sense of smell.

106
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:23,300
Speaker 0: That's your luxury box right there.

107
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,443
Speaker 1: Okay You have a news.

108
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:31,948
Speaker 0: I don't know you can go first.

109
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:33,553
Speaker 1: All right, I didn't?

110
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:35,800
Speaker 1: I couldn't find any decent news on the internet, right?

111
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:38,197
Speaker 1: So I found this sort of.

112
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:43,819
Speaker 1: It's a news but it's a local news for someone far away from us or at least I think they're far away from us.

113
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:47,107
Speaker 0: All news is local news for someone right?

114
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:50,056
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it could be world news or international.

115
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:51,379
Speaker 0: No one else lives in the world.

116
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,247
Speaker 1: Local means like small-time news.

117
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:56,311
Speaker 1: It's not a big story.

118
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:58,980
Speaker 0: Oh, so there's no local news in New York City.

119
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:05,776
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's plenty I mean, but it doesn't happen to be the news that I found if I was sitting next to JFK.

120
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:07,020
Speaker 0: it affects me directly.

121
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,305
Speaker 0: It's local news for this.

122
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:11,700
Speaker 1: Anyway, the website I found this on is Chris online.

123
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,513
Speaker 1: It's it's a website that is just Brian Chris's blog.

124
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:17,038
Speaker 1: I hope I'm pronouncing his last name, right?

125
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:17,500
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter.

126
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:22,400
Speaker 1: The subtitle on the on his blog is when there's nothing else on the internet.

127
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,250
Speaker 1: There was nothing else on the internet.

128
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,159
Speaker 1: so I went to Chris online and here we go.

129
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:36,244
Speaker 1: He put made a blog post called how to catch a Netflix thief Basically crackhead.

130
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:44,037
Speaker 1: he has Netflix like we do and He kept getting them lost in the mail and he kept telling Netflix that they were lost in the mail.

131
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:47,272
Speaker 1: and Netflix is cool With that right, but he's like hi.

132
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,740
Speaker 1: I wonder if these are lost in the mail.

133
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,432
Speaker 1: I will set up a camera on my macbook to look at my mailbox.

134
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:53,435
Speaker 0: That's brilliant.

135
00:08:53,796 --> 00:08:54,438
Speaker 1: It's not brilliant.

136
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,014
Speaker 0: It's obvious Yes, but it's brilliant cuz he actually did it.

137
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:57,720
Speaker 0: he did it.

138
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,631
Speaker 0: No, no matter how cool your idea is if you don't do it.

139
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,880
Speaker 0: It's not brilliant cuz he didn't do it exactly.

140
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:07,470
Speaker 1: So he set it up digital camcorder macbook squirrels.

141
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:09,977
Speaker 0: No, is it squirrels stealing his DVDs?

142
00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:11,180
Speaker 0: No crackheads.

143
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:15,554
Speaker 1: No, it was the fat kid who lives in the nearby apartment.

144
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,216
Speaker 0: Wow.

145
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:17,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, what'd he do?

146
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:19,849
Speaker 1: He just came and sold his Netflixes.

147
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,111
Speaker 0: No, no.

148
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:21,940
Speaker 0: No, I mean, what did the guy do with his knowledge?

149
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:27,500
Speaker 1: Well first he called Netflix and he was like listen this fat kid and you get this pictures of the fat kid right here.

150
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,592
Speaker 1: God, is he a fat kid?

151
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:31,183
Speaker 1: That's disgusting This picture.

Speaker 1: and he's just like.

153
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:34,596
Speaker 1: yes, some kid was stealing my Netflixes.

154
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:39,314
Speaker 1: They're like, oh, okay Just you know, we just you know, call the police and we won't charge you or anything.

155
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:40,760
Speaker 1: You know that Netflix is cool.

156
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:41,970
Speaker 1: They didn't bother him about it.

157
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:43,200
Speaker 0: All right, that's step one.

158
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,335
Speaker 0: I'm curious if he is going through with the fullness that I would go through with that's.

159
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:52,680
Speaker 1: they call the police Right and the police came and I guess he talked to like a detective and they investigated or whatever.

160
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,220
Speaker 1: But you know, this is the reason I'm making this news is because I've always been curious.

161
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,817
Speaker 1: Tampering with the mail is a federal offense is well known well known and I wondered like it's.

Speaker 1: it is a federal offense But what?

163
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:06,927
Speaker 1: how bad is it?

164
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,415
Speaker 1: If you if you're caught, you know what it's.

165
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:10,780
Speaker 0: what about tampering with the mail?

166
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:17,680
Speaker 0: No, but what goes down, you know, I've always been kind of curious Always threatened me with that when we'd be at RIT be like I'll tamper with your mail.

167
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:22,760
Speaker 1: No, I used to say if you tamper with my mail, it's a federal pen one of the other.

168
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,573
Speaker 1: Oh, man, his site just broke from a database error.

169
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:26,920
Speaker 0: Oh, all right.

170
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,804
Speaker 0: Anyway, what happened?

171
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:29,110
Speaker 1: in the middle of reading my news?

172
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,174
Speaker 1: the website wrote?

173
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:31,179
Speaker 0: Well, do you know what happened?

174
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,147
Speaker 1: Yes I know what happened.

175
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:37,631
Speaker 1: Okay, basically uh The the local police are like, uh-huh.

176
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:43,620
Speaker 1: They did their investigation whatever and then they said, you know We're gonna had to pass this up because it is a federal offense.

177
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:47,478
Speaker 1: and indeed they did pass it up to a higher authority.

178
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:53,815
Speaker 1: and Then the guy received notice that the case went to trial and the trial was over.

179
00:10:53,835 --> 00:11:07,118
Speaker 1: and they find the kid $750 I guess or his mom that's it whoever and They put him in some sort of like first offenders program, which is a like rehab for first offending kids.

180
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,203
Speaker 0: That's good That's good.

181
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:10,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like huh?

182
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,779
Speaker 1: So but if it really is a federal offense and that the feds really will come and get you.

183
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:26,866
Speaker 1: well Yes as well they should they should but it's he was kind of interesting to actually see someone get in I guess arrested and then convicted of male Offending for stealing some dudes.

184
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:27,528
Speaker 1: Netflix's.

185
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,033
Speaker 0: damn you fat kid.

186
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:31,140
Speaker 1: It was a really schlubby looking fat kid.

187
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,229
Speaker 1: You see the pictures if the website ever comes back.

188
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,579
Speaker 0: I was trying to look but I don't know if I want to see it.

189
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just a schlubby fat kid.

190
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:44,240
Speaker 1: He's wearing just like shorts and nothing else and he's got this like little like crap fro and it's not a pleasant sight.

191
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:49,393
Speaker 1: it's a lot like You know Lord Gloom, but stealing a Netflix.

192
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:50,979
Speaker 0: Netflix is practically free.

193
00:11:51,564 --> 00:12:01,662
Speaker 0: I know I know Even though I was listening to a certain unnamed podcast recently And I just want to point out that a lot of people don't seem to realize that Netflix on demand lets you watch as much As you want.

194
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:05,256
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you could leave it streaming 24/7 seven days a week.

195
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,079
Speaker 0: They don't care at all.

196
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:10,593
Speaker 1: Yep, see I figured out Netflix's plan with the Netflix on demand.

197
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:11,676
Speaker 0: I figured it out too.

198
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:12,920
Speaker 1: What do you think their plan is?

199
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:26,717
Speaker 0: Well, I've noticed one thing because they have a lot of stuff in the Netflix on demand, but they don't have Enough because if you search for a movie it will not be in there like no matter what.

200
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:29,280
Speaker 0: if you search for a movie It's not gonna be in the on demand.

201
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:38,039
Speaker 0: but if you browse through the on demand you'll see a whole bunch of movies that you wouldn't mind watching right now and There's just enough there to keep me from going to Blockbuster ever again.

202
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:48,377
Speaker 1: Well, that's could be part of their plan, but my thinking is right The more you watch in the on demand the less the less.

203
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:54,960
Speaker 1: the less frequently You're gonna be sending your DVDs back and you're gonna be a less likely to pick those movies as DVDs.

204
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,367
Speaker 1: So they can buy less of those movies.

205
00:12:57,407 --> 00:12:58,630
Speaker 1: Maybe they're expensive movies.

206
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,332
Speaker 1: Maybe they're movies.

207
00:12:59,613 --> 00:12:59,994
Speaker 1: They're trying to.

208
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:02,040
Speaker 0: I think it's a confluence of all these factors.

209
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a it.

210
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:06,220
Speaker 1: people wonder like how is Netflix making money on this?

211
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,989
Speaker 1: Well, if you drop your Netflix subscription, you're gonna lose that.

212
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,420
Speaker 1: so if it hooks you in you're still gonna keep your subscription.

213
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:18,560
Speaker 1: You know, even if you don't you might reduce your discs, but you'll never leave because you let your hooked on the on demand.

214
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:30,640
Speaker 0: yeah, the old the only problem I've ever had with Netflix is that Two avatar DVDs in a row were too scratched to play you damn kids stop scratching your DVDs.

215
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:33,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, stop stealing them out my mailbox.

216
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:33,828
Speaker 1: Thank you.

217
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:34,851
Speaker 0: There's no fat kid here.

218
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:37,640
Speaker 0: No, no, there's no fat kid anywhere near our house.

219
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:39,148
Speaker 0: All right, go go.

220
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,094
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah news.

221
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:43,426
Speaker 1: Eh, yeah news That it the websites back.

222
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:44,089
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's not.

223
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:44,671
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe it is.

224
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:51,120
Speaker 0: All right, there's a whole bunch of news And there's a lot I want to talk about but at the same time all the political stuff.

225
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,525
Speaker 0: I know Scott doesn't care about it.

226
00:13:52,585 --> 00:13:56,724
Speaker 0: So bringing it up really wouldn't really be interesting unless you wanted to hear me groan Guess what?

227
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:57,532
Speaker 1: I'll let you hear me groan.

228
00:13:57,573 --> 00:14:09,975
Speaker 0: Anyway, I Mean I could talk about how as I said last week I'm Reasonably certain I give it a 95% chance that Barack Obama is going to be the nominee and that there's no way Hillary can come back.

229
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,538
Speaker 0: But Scott doesn't want me to talk about that.

230
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:14,426
Speaker 1: I can also say you said it already.

231
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:20,430
Speaker 0: I could also talk about saying the same thing for we interesting leaked White House men Memo, I almost said menu.

232
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:21,899
Speaker 0: That would be a little bit frightening.

233
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:24,337
Speaker 1: The menu is probably really great.

234
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:29,802
Speaker 1: there here They have like, you know babies on it and it's guaranteed not poison Wow.

235
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:30,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess it is.

236
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:35,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's kind of like if you're the Emperor you've got that guy who tastes your food.

237
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:36,097
Speaker 1: You mean you?

238
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,450
Speaker 0: What?

239
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,885
Speaker 0: That doesn't make any sense.

240
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:43,880
Speaker 0: I'm not I am NOT an emperor nor am I an Emperor's food taster.

241
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,209
Speaker 1: The Emperor is his own food taste.

242
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:49,421
Speaker 1: I mean someone else might taste it first, but if he doesn't taste his food What?

243
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:49,682
Speaker 1: what's?

244
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,368
Speaker 1: the point is like someone remove his tongue?

245
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:51,408
Speaker 1: I?

246
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,686
Speaker 0: Farted as soon as he stopped talking.

247
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:58,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was fun.

248
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,975
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's Thursday.

249
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,920
Speaker 0: if he couldn't tell I like to talk.

250
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:05,570
Speaker 1: Let's try to keep this not like last Thursday, which is it's.

251
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:10,819
Speaker 0: I'd like to talk a little bit about not so much this news I'm not even gonna talk about the article or any of that.

252
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:28,877
Speaker 0: I want to talk about the topic a tiny bit because it it illustrates why I am NOT afraid of terrorism and why I think pretty much everyone in America who is afraid of terrorism in America is I don't want to say something so crude as being a goddamn liberal pussy.

253
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:29,820
Speaker 0: That's doofus.

254
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:31,880
Speaker 0: I just wanted to say goddamn liberal pussy.

255
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,620
Speaker 0: I don't like to use the word pussy I think doofus and I don't like to use the word liberal in that sense.

256
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:39,068
Speaker 1: And if you don't use a doofus we can use the word wuss.

257
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:40,131
Speaker 0: wuss works.

258
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:44,222
Speaker 0: doofus doesn't really fit but I'll put it this way Doofus.

259
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:49,259
Speaker 0: the title of the slash dot link here is engineers make good terrorists

260
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,480
Speaker 1: and

261
00:15:50,701 --> 00:16:05,160
Speaker 0: I've seen a number of articles that broach this subject in the past talking about how if you want to analyze like the Thinking it would take to be an effective terrorist There's no one better to commit acts of terror than an engineer.

262
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:11,940
Speaker 0: And in fact a lot of terrorists that have been discovered or studied in history have had engineering backgrounds.

263
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:20,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I mean this is purely anecdotal here But you know, I'm among engineers and engineer type thinking people.

264
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:24,190
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot of people blow a lot of stuff up because they were bored.

265
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:32,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, and whenever there are You know real terrorists and ever a real terrorist attack happens, right?

266
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:36,520
Speaker 1: It's always the engineer type thinking people saying, you know, why did they do that?

267
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:38,572
Speaker 1: they would have succeeded if they only did this.

268
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:53,720
Speaker 1: and in fact I find that people who have an engineer type way of thinking are often less afraid of Because we look at the world and we say wow if you did this It would be so easy to cause a ludicrous amount of damage, you know, and no one's done it there.

269
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:54,644
Speaker 0: That is the point.

270
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:55,408
Speaker 0: I was going to make.

271
00:16:55,629 --> 00:17:11,500
Speaker 1: the other thing is I think that while Engineer type thinking people like can come up with ways to you know Do really effective terrorist attacks and such I don't think they're any more likely to want to do terrorist attacks than anyone else.

272
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:30,940
Speaker 0: Well that that was the kind of the point I was gonna make is that you know, they talk they talk about this and I've noticed cuz I. a good example of this was when we were in high school because the Columbine Incident happened while Scott and I were in high school and I remember for the next week or so Pretty much there were two good tours.

273
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,665
Speaker 0: well there were three kinds of people in the schools.

274
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:40,580
Speaker 0: one kind were the people who were afraid after this and really freaked out and Like they were nervous and weird about it for the rest of high school.

275
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:52,441
Speaker 0: And then there were the group of people and I was among them who would kind of seriously debate How absolutely ineffective the attack was and couldn't imagine why if they were going to do something like that They did it.

276
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:57,700
Speaker 0: So quote unquote shoddily and it's not like we were planning on column binding.

277
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:03,762
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't like, you know, they should have killed more people or killing people was good It was.

278
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:16,383
Speaker 1: if their goal was to kill people they did a really bad job and it's like you analyze the job They did even though you completely disagree with their goals and intents and and such, you know You can't.

279
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:17,450
Speaker 1: it's like if you see.

280
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:19,120
Speaker 1: it's sort of like, you know.

281
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,680
Speaker 0: And I got Bugs Bunny cartoon when like I was gonna use the example of a fat man trying to eat something.

282
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:31,540
Speaker 1: But go the Bugs Bunny cartoon where the gremlin is hitting the front of the bomb with the hammer Right and Bugs Bunny is like, you know, oh you're doing that all wrong.

283
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:33,071
Speaker 1: No, here's the right way to do it.

284
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,023
Speaker 1: and he hits it real hard, you know And it blows up.

285
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:38,380
Speaker 1: and it's like Bugs Bunny doesn't want the bomb to blow up.

286
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,340
Speaker 1: He's not looking out to kill people but he sees someone doing a bad job of something and he's like you're doing a bad job.

287
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,987
Speaker 1: This is how to do it better.

288
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:46,991
Speaker 0: as a brief aside.

289
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:50,645
Speaker 0: I would like to point out that Bugs Bunny was an Absolute asshole.

290
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:51,388
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

291
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:54,137
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah that opera singer didn't deserve that at all.

292
00:18:54,398 --> 00:19:09,492
Speaker 0: But anyway so I People who are afraid of terrorism and Scott brought this up very briefly, but I point out that how there have been very few Terrorist attacks in young US soil very few ever.

293
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:19,385
Speaker 0: you're more likely to die every day going to work Then you are to be killed for the driving is like a 10,000 times more dangerous than terrorists now Being.

294
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:21,039
Speaker 0: I mean we don't want to get the police on us.

295
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:29,675
Speaker 0: But consider this smart people can look around the world and it would be trivial To conduct some sort of act of terrorism some horrible act.

296
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:38,720
Speaker 0: There's so many opportunities in ways that Anyone smart or with a quote-unquote engineering background could trivially pull these things off.

297
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:43,125
Speaker 0: But despite it being so easy It doesn't happen.

298
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:45,472
Speaker 0: and that leads me to believe that either one.

299
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:53,640
Speaker 0: all the people who want to be terrorists are Independent of that stupid which is a lot of them are like look at that like look it's a lot of examples.

300
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:56,585
Speaker 1: There's a guy.

301
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:57,893
Speaker 1: actually recently he was caught.

302
00:19:57,914 --> 00:20:00,425
Speaker 1: I don't know what he's trying to do But they just caught him cuz he's a moron.

303
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:04,700
Speaker 0: Oh, he had a. basically he had a bag full of pipe bomb making material.

304
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,560
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, right and he said that's the guy he recently just had a bag full of pipe bomb making material got in a plane.

305
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:22,760
Speaker 1: So the security we have you know and Bruce Schneier the security expert of the universe will confirm is the security We have largely only catches idiots and mostly confuses normal people who mean no harm.

306
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,017
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing because there's two parts of this here.

307
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:31,600
Speaker 0: one This is the thing that bothers me the most because people out there are afraid the shoe bomber was effective.

308
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,748
Speaker 0: He was an incredibly effective terrorist.

309
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:37,080
Speaker 0: The shoe bomber was one of the most effective terrorists in American history.

310
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:47,958
Speaker 0: all he had to do was try to light his shoes on fire and now I a Normal human being have to take my goddamn shoes off every time I get out of plane.

311
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:50,454
Speaker 0: Yep What kind of crap is that?

312
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:51,039
Speaker 0: He won?

313
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:54,354
Speaker 1: But you know his plan failed.

314
00:20:54,535 --> 00:21:01,740
Speaker 1: if he was had it He was smarter and had an engineer way of thinking and still maintained his evil desires to blow shit up.

315
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,198
Speaker 1: Well, then then he probably would have had a you know a better plan and would have succeeded in.

316
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,732
Speaker 0: actually There's a correlation between being smart and not wanting to kill people.

317
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,376
Speaker 1: I think there there definitely is.

318
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:30,064
Speaker 0: but I think there's another possibility Because there are a lot of people who are very intelligent who are also on the wrong side of the whole terrorism thing I mean the 9/11 attacks for what it's worth were pulled off by very smart people who put together a very well staged Horrible thing.

319
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:36,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Unabomber wasn't that dumb and he was dumb, but he wasn't you know But he was smart away with it for a long time.

320
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,416
Speaker 0: He was dumb for what he was doing, but he was smart in how he was going about it.

321
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:53,080
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but Maybe all this despite what a lot of people in the government and a lot of people in general would like you to believe Maybe there isn't this vast gigantic terrorist conspiracy to take down the United States.

322
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:03,800
Speaker 0: maybe Al-qaeda and all these things were just Semi unrelated strings of I don't want to get into you know second-order simulacra blah blah blah blah blah social blah.

323
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:09,840
Speaker 0: but Maybe it's all just kind of a sham and bad things happen.

324
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,341
Speaker 0: But it's not like there's this organized worldwide terrorist conspiracy to fuck us All.

325
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:17,760
Speaker 1: if there was a worldwide terrorist conspiracy to fuck us it would have already fucked us.

326
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:24,556
Speaker 1: We would have been you know, it did fuck us But it fucked us 20 times worse and the fact that it hasn't happened.

327
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:33,928
Speaker 0: I Really can't be cool with someone who is still afraid of terrorists in this day and age because that makes them win and I hate To use the phrase the terrorists have won.

328
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,586
Speaker 0: but as long as people out there are afraid then yes, they kind of have Yep, they're terrorists.

329
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:40,152
Speaker 1: their goal to make you afraid.

330
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:40,835
Speaker 1: Are you afraid?

331
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:42,140
Speaker 1: Yes, that's not good.

332
00:22:48,752 --> 00:22:50,538
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

333
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:51,742
Speaker 1: my thing today is so hot.

334
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:52,303
Speaker 0: Mr.

335
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:56,838
Speaker 0: Rogers plus breakdancing That's all I really have to say about that other than that.

336
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,123
Speaker 1: Is it as good as mr.

337
00:22:58,163 --> 00:23:00,270
Speaker 1: Rogers plus the Donkey Kong machine?

338
00:23:00,573 --> 00:23:01,545
Speaker 0: It's yeah, it's better.

339
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:06,001
Speaker 0: I think Cuz he tries some moves he tries to move he's okay.

340
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:06,663
Speaker 0: He's okay.

341
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:07,325
Speaker 0: He's not great.

342
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:09,069
Speaker 1: But uh, it's been you.

343
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:11,504
Speaker 0: You've never seen me breakdance.

344
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:15,925
Speaker 0: hence I'll say move you have zero moves.

345
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:16,167
Speaker 1: Mr.

346
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:16,690
Speaker 1: Rogers win.

347
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:24,990
Speaker 0: I'll say this I'll try to get my mom to send me some of the tapes because you realize For much of my youth I was very into breakdancing.

348
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:26,609
Speaker 1: That's not good.

349
00:23:26,851 --> 00:23:37,804
Speaker 0: And in fact when I used to go to Farm City week in Macomb When I was a kid because my grandparents were carpenters and they'd set up a little shop and they'd sell awesome stuff And it was this big fair and I would just kind of hang out there.

350
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:45,370
Speaker 0: I Would always bring this big sheet of cardboard and I'd set it up behind him and I'd pull out my little cassette player.

351
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,177
Speaker 0: It was a fisher-price cassette player.

352
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:47,820
Speaker 1: Is he yellow?

353
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,547
Speaker 0: It was white and red.

354
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:55,250
Speaker 0: mine was yellow And I also had the Big Bird record player, but that's my Big Bird record player.

355
00:23:55,674 --> 00:24:05,750
Speaker 1: It was off the hook, especially I'd be like Green Led Zeppelin in the Beatles on my you know, Big Bird record play.

356
00:24:05,772 --> 00:24:08,678
Speaker 0: Yeah I think off the hook of flies and I would play.

357
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:18,653
Speaker 0: I don't even remember what music I played and I would breakdance but I was like five and There were videos of this and I would gather a crowd Most.

358
00:24:18,753 --> 00:24:26,827
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was because I was good or more likely because you're a little kid because there's a little kid Spinning around on his butt on a piece of cardboard in the street.

359
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:35,321
Speaker 1: Yep All right, my thing of the day owns your thing that you think these piece of shit, uh-huh No, no, not really, but my thing it is so great.

360
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:37,030
Speaker 1: I think it dwarfs most things of the day.

361
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:38,655
Speaker 0: We'll see about that.

362
00:24:38,997 --> 00:24:45,829
Speaker 1: All right, so if you're a kid and you you want to get high Imagine if you're a Japanese kid, right?

363
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,215
Speaker 0: I'm the happiest boy in the world.

364
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:51,507
Speaker 0: I play video games that out that me in the real world will never see.

365
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:52,932
Speaker 1: you're in elementary school Whatever.

366
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:55,401
Speaker 1: All right, and every day eat lunch.

367
00:24:55,522 --> 00:24:56,465
Speaker 1: What kind of lunch do you eat?

368
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:57,469
Speaker 0: I don't know.

369
00:24:58,312 --> 00:24:59,115
Speaker 1: Well, what do you have for lunch?

370
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:05,175
Speaker 1: What me if you're you know, if you're a little elementary school Japanese kid, I Don't know a bento.

371
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:06,440
Speaker 1: Yes a bento.

372
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:06,861
Speaker 1: Okay.

373
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:09,149
Speaker 1: All right, and where would this bento come from?

374
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,264
Speaker 0: My girlfriend because I was rocking with the ladies in elementary school actually.

375
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:14,605
Speaker 0: Yeah.

376
00:25:14,786 --> 00:25:18,297
Speaker 0: All right, actually, yeah Okay, I got a story about that.

377
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,079
Speaker 0: I got a couple stories.

378
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,190
Speaker 1: What so what is your elementary school bento look like?

379
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:24,553

Speaker 1: You don't know.

381
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,383
Speaker 0: I don't know.

382
00:25:26,404 --> 00:25:27,510
Speaker 1: Is it high quality?

383
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,116
Speaker 0: Of course, is it?

00:25:29,256 --> 00:25:30,803
Speaker 1: is it just you know, look like food?

385

Speaker 1: or is there something special about it?

386
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:37,365
Speaker 0: It's eight layers and every layer is set to a different famicom game.

387
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:38,910
Speaker 1: Ah, now we're talking.

388
00:25:39,552 --> 00:25:44,827
Speaker 1: Here's a website that is devoted entirely to the making of the cute bentos.

389
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:48,880
Speaker 0: Oh, man Oh, man, I gotta totally make some cute bento.

390
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,070
Speaker 1: We're talking like pokeball rice balls.

391
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:59,200
Speaker 1: We're talking Hello Kitty thingies with like, you know a little flower like like.

392
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:02,897
Speaker 1: It's like god, it's so cute.

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,269
Speaker 0: We should try to make some bentos.

395
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,976
Speaker 1: I don't think you can make bentos like this because on this website They also have.

396
00:26:11,097 --> 00:26:12,124
Speaker 1: I can only look at the pictures.

397
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:13,130
Speaker 1: I can't read the moon language.

398
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:23,005
Speaker 1: They also have all sorts of like links to different cute bento making tools and accessories Like different boxes.

399
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:29,115
Speaker 1: my favorite thing is this there's like a little pan so that you can make up like a pancake that has like a happy face.

400
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:33,656
Speaker 1: There's like little like Hello Kitty like cookie cutters.

Speaker 0: Uh so it's Monty pythons flying.

410
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,068
Speaker 0: I Couldn't come up with a better way to introduce that.

411
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:14,454
Speaker 0: we're gonna talk about it last week.

412
00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:15,640
Speaker 0: We got to talk about it tonight.

413
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:19,930
Speaker 0: One if you don't know what Monty Python is already.

414
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:26,429
Speaker 1: for the longest time in my life like up until middle school I knew there was a thing called Monty Python.

415
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:28,256
Speaker 1: I knew nothing else about it whatsoever.

416
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:28,878
Speaker 0: Really?

417
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:35,081
Speaker 0: Yes I used to come home from middle school every day and then it would be on TV and then right after that would be Benny Hill.

418
00:27:35,202 --> 00:27:44,458
Speaker 1: before before we say what Monty Python is for the morons Flying Let's let's talk about the first discovery of Monty Python.

419
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:55,017
Speaker 0: All right Well, I think I mean I've seen I've been watching Monty Python But that like the real discovery the moment where I fully got it was for much of my life.

420
00:27:55,097 --> 00:28:03,320
Speaker 0: my dad in particular but also my mom would get me into various things, you know movie type things and My dad would always every now and then we'd be in a video store or something.

421
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:09,765
Speaker 0: I'd be trying to buy anime and he'd be like, you know Monty Python in the Holy Grail and I'd be like, yeah, what's this?

422
00:28:10,506 --> 00:28:11,589
Speaker 0: and I just hadn't seen it.

423
00:28:12,131 --> 00:28:18,464
Speaker 0: and one day it happened to be on TV and I turned it was on.

424
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:22,517
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, this is that thing and I laughed I watched it.

425
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:22,838
Speaker 0: Okay.

426
00:28:22,858 --> 00:28:24,580
Speaker 0: I'm watching this I'm watching this and something happened.

427
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:39,520
Speaker 0: it was like we were like ten minutes in the movie and I laughed so hard and what I saw that I missed like the Next ten jokes and as soon as I recovered and my side stopped hurting and I looked up again I immediately started laughing again and it was like the funniest thing I'd ever seen in my life.

428
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:53,143
Speaker 1: alright, so me I was at a friend's house sometime middle school for a party, right and Everyone was like, oh we're gonna watch something something and it was Holy Grail, of course, and I was like, yeah, whatever Whatever.

429
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:58,060
Speaker 1: and at the time he had a much better computer than I had and many more computer games than I had.

430
00:28:58,665 --> 00:29:08,826
Speaker 1: So I started playing Warcraft 2 Not having played Warcraft 2 and I just played it and I kept playing it and I was just sort of involved in this game And I wasn't really paying attention.

431
00:29:09,328 --> 00:29:18,163
Speaker 1: and I turned around at one point, you know getting out of you know The zone that I was in and people were watching this movie and I saw like nights and stuff and I was like, oh man What the hell.

432
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:25,859
Speaker 1: but they were already sort of into the movie like halfway ish Like it was already at the the invincible connected, you know getting all his limbs chopped off and whatnot.

433
00:29:26,507 --> 00:29:27,257
Speaker 1: So I was just like whatever.

434
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:32,455
Speaker 1: I just kept playing my Warcraft 2 and I heard people laughing crazily, but I mostly ignored it.

435
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:34,020
Speaker 1: It's sad story, isn't it?

436
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:40,663
Speaker 1: And then you know, eventually the movie was over but then you know it didn't stop.

437
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:55,899
Speaker 1: you see if we're over the next many days all my little middle school friends were saying such things as And I was just like what the fuck what the fuck is wrong with you guys.

438
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,060
Speaker 1: So I went to the blockbuster.

439
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:06,879
Speaker 1: Hey, I got the Holy Grail and I watched it with my family and I was like, oh man It was quite similar with the I remember sides.

440
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:10,539
Speaker 0: I'd finally see it and I I go to my dad the next day and I'm like.

441
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:18,051
Speaker 0: So I saw that Monty Python in the Holy Grail and he's very judicious like he raises an eyebrow He's like and what did you think of it?

442
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:19,640
Speaker 1: What did you learn?

443
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:30,220
Speaker 0: and at that point I just started laughing because I started remembering the movie and I'm sure this is the experience with pretty much every geek out there in the world.

444
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:45,271
Speaker 1: But you've seen Monty Python in the Holy Grail so many times that it's almost not funny anymore because you've memorized it Entirely, it's sort of funny in a way like, you know The Simpsons and like old Family Guy episodes and Spaceballs the first time.

445
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:48,320
Speaker 0: I watched it like literally that I'm not exaggerating at all.

446
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,640
Speaker 0: I was laughing so hard like I couldn't breathe in and my stomach hurt.

447
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:53,323
Speaker 1: That's pretty.

448
00:30:53,383 --> 00:31:04,200
Speaker 0: it was really painful and it sucked but I couldn't stop laughing, you know I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.

449
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,660
Speaker 1: So actually before I was able to watch any more Monty Python, right?

450
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,295
Speaker 1: I got the this Monty Python computer game for Windows 3.1.

451
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:14,660
Speaker 0: Was that the Holy Grail one?

452
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:21,363
Speaker 1: No it was the the Flying Circus one with the giant foot on the front the one that had a million like 120 by 120 pixel like OLE videos.

453
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:26,623
Speaker 0: Yes, that one I also had.

454
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:26,964
Speaker 0: that.

455
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:34,988
Speaker 1: that is why the skits that were in those little hundred twenty one hundred twenty videos are much better Remembered by myself than some of the others.

456
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:46,799
Speaker 0: but Monty Python such as the large God we got to avoid turning this into the dirty vicar sketch.

457
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:49,048
Speaker 0: I like tits.

458
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:50,616
Speaker 0: Summarize Proust.

459
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:56,698
Speaker 0: Yes We're not gonna just sit here and say all the skits we like because eventually we'll name all of them.

460
00:31:56,898 --> 00:32:00,499
Speaker 0: Yep My favorite one ever is salad days.

461
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:02,379
Speaker 1: Salad days you suck.

462
00:32:03,361 --> 00:32:07,958
Speaker 1: Anyone fancy a game of tennis if I had to pick one?

463
00:32:07,978 --> 00:32:13,155
Speaker 0: Well, no No, if I had to pick one it is of course the crimson permanent assurance.

464
00:32:13,175 --> 00:32:14,640
Speaker 1: I like the crimson permanent assurance.

465
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,673
Speaker 1: It's a high quality, but that's really.

466
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:17,640
Speaker 1: it's not a skit.

467
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,932
Speaker 1: It's from the beginning of the you know, the meaning of life.

468
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:25,080
Speaker 0: Well, it was originally written as something else.

469
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,943
Speaker 1: It was.

470
00:32:25,963 --> 00:32:28,753
Speaker 1: they just stuck it at the beginning of the meaning of life movie.

471
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:38,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, um, I Say, you know as cliched it is the silly walks is so great that it's you know Because the way that man moves those legs.

472
00:32:38,227 --> 00:32:40,253
Speaker 0: John Cleese is a god among men.

473
00:32:40,273 --> 00:32:43,985
Speaker 1: and then you take you know He believes in a lot of randy bullshit.

474
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:48,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what also from from all I've read he was an asshole.

475
00:32:48,282 --> 00:32:49,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he still is an asshole.

476
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:51,240
Speaker 1: He's a funny asshole.

477
00:32:53,984 --> 00:32:58,464
Speaker 1: And the other one that if I had to go with one is the word The where.

478
00:32:58,484 --> 00:33:02,324
Speaker 1: that the funny the joke, that's so funny that you're like read two words You have to go to the hospital.

479
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:07,722
Speaker 1: I don't know I use it to fight Germany and it's just like Something.

480
00:33:07,742 --> 00:33:12,020
Speaker 0: there was the the argument skit which just because it's very relevant to my life is one.

481
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:18,940
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot to mention I also had the vinyl album of Monty Python something something and it was had two sides.

482
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:28,008
Speaker 1: I know it had three sides I had and then there was a third hidden side or if you could put the needle in the groove you could actually hear a Third special thing on there.

483
00:33:28,028 --> 00:33:28,491
Speaker 1: You know what?

512
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:19,494

513
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:22,760
Speaker 1: Oh Take a bunch of flowers.

514
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:28,370
Speaker 0: Get No offense to any Welshman out there.

515
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:33,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually I actually like Wales Flag with an awesome dragon lion thing on it.

516
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:36,295
Speaker 0: Yeah Wales pretty much wins the flag contest.

517
00:35:36,315 --> 00:35:37,418
Speaker 0: pretty much hands down.

518
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:41,633
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, oh, yeah Monty Python the style of humor.

519
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:42,657
Speaker 1: I'm going to Wikipedia.

520
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:43,560
Speaker 1: Look at the Welsh flag.

521
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,715
Speaker 1: Oh, look at that flag that big red dragon.

522
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:51,140
Speaker 0: That's pretty dangerous I mean for people aren't fully aware of all this Monty Python their style of humor.

523
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,974
Speaker 0: They were not the first people to do humor like this by any stretch.

524
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:55,240
Speaker 0: nor were they were the last people.

525
00:35:55,906 --> 00:36:11,679
Speaker 0: but for a lot of Americans particularly this was kind of the icon of British comedy and this sort of humor appealed to geeky people in a way that very few things had ever appealed to geeky people before.

526
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:14,385
Speaker 0: and Monty Python.

527
00:36:14,707 --> 00:36:27,930
Speaker 0: if you pretty much go to any anime con any video game con especially a gaming con and you can pretty much assume that anyone over the age of 16 or 17 has seen All of the Monty Python movies or at least the Holy Grail.

528
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got.

529
00:36:28,993 --> 00:36:31,180
Speaker 1: it's very strange that it's geek tie-ins.

530
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:35,456
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's only because of the Holy Grail or what but it's it's somehow.

531
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:40,520
Speaker 1: in the modern day Like back in the day Monty Python was like comedy for everyone and it still is, you know.

532
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,340
Speaker 1: But for some reason now it has a geek, you know, at least a geek tie-in of some sort.

533
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,412
Speaker 1: I mean, they're selling.

534
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:49,399
Speaker 1: you know Must wow is actually a few years ago.

535
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:56,409
Speaker 1: They're selling like, you know, the bitey rabbit plush toys and stuff and it's like, you know Two geeks like you would go to a gaming con.

536
00:36:56,429 --> 00:36:58,317
Speaker 1: You see the bitey rabbit for sale and you like what?

537
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,985
Speaker 0: No You don't go you go duh.

538
00:37:00,528 --> 00:37:06,300
Speaker 0: Well, I know but it's like oh like like, you know We talk about all video games and anime fandom are kind of intertwined to a big degree.

539
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,460
Speaker 0: But then like sci-fi and fantasy are really intertwined because there's reasons for that.

540
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:17,600
Speaker 0: But sci-fi and gaming like tabletop gaming are really intertwined and there's kind of this whole Venn diagram web of geekery.

541
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:24,900
Speaker 0: But Monty Python and the enjoyment of that style of humor seems to be almost universal among geeks.

542
00:37:25,421 --> 00:37:31,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I've never met a person who is geeky that didn't enjoy the Monty Python's who also had seen it.

543
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:39,255
Speaker 0: I've very rarely in my life known people who were not already Intense fans of Monty Python long before I had ever met them.

544
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:42,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean It's like everybody knows.

545
00:37:42,348 --> 00:37:44,880
Speaker 0: I mean how many is anyone out this anyone out there?

546
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,700
Speaker 0: I really want to know and our listeners who has never seen or at least heard of the parrot sketch?

547
00:37:50,102 --> 00:38:01,374
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you it's got to be on YouTube, right Lee I I'm of the mind that the car repair sketch from how to irritate people Which is basically the same sketch is superior.

548
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:03,566
Speaker 1: Uh No, I really like the parents.

549
00:38:03,606 --> 00:38:04,049
Speaker 1: Yes, of course.

550
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:12,335
Speaker 1: I like the dirty pharmacist sketch Semprene, oh, it's it's the dirty chemist sketch right because they don't call it a pharmacist.

551
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,060
Speaker 0: and yes, you damn pretense.

552
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:15,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, I learned one thing.

553
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:22,420
Speaker 0: I learned the quickest way to spot someone who was faking a British accent, but isn't actually British and sound like Monty Python.

554
00:38:22,704 --> 00:38:23,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's one way.

555
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:36,271
Speaker 0: But the other thing is I learned that someone could have a perfect British accent But then they'll say patronize and apparently everyone in Britain says patronize Uh-huh, but then again that might just be a trick to confuse me.

556
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:36,813
Speaker 0: Mmm.

557
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:41,038
Speaker 1: It could be but anyway, hey Let's talk more about what?

558
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:43,806
Speaker 1: My money by then why I?

559
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,032
Speaker 0: the reason I like Monty Python.

560
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:52,496
Speaker 0: I can't speak for other geeks, but it's got this perfect combination of non-sequitur.

561
00:38:52,536 --> 00:38:54,224
Speaker 0: just It's kind of like.

562
00:38:54,264 --> 00:39:00,464
Speaker 0: this was non-sequitur humor before we had Family Guy and before we had you know This aqua teen whatever's like.

563
00:39:00,986 --> 00:39:07,892
Speaker 0: this was the non-sequitur humor the weird humor the humor that you either thought it was the best thing in the world or you totally didn't get it.

564
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:17,480
Speaker 0: and In addition to that it was often very Intelligence and a lot of people will say oh that's pretentious and that's a cop-out.

565
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:25,599
Speaker 0: But no a lot of these sketches were brilliantly written and brilliantly performed brilliantly done Yeah, I mean at the time that I saw this stuff.

566
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:29,191
Speaker 1: I not seen anything else that was like it and a lot of it.

567
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:31,098
Speaker 1: there is still nothing like it.

568
00:39:31,278 --> 00:39:38,440
Speaker 1: really I Mean you have a night and he's getting chopped up and he's like, oh no It's just a flesh wound and he's bleeding all over the place.

569
00:39:38,781 --> 00:39:39,867
Speaker 1: It doesn't get funnier than that.

570
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:40,671
Speaker 0: It does.

571
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:47,964
Speaker 1: there are funnier things than that No, but I mean just think about that bleeding all over the place and he's just like oh whatever But there's stuff like that.

572
00:39:48,024 --> 00:39:48,124
Speaker 0: Now.

573
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:55,547
Speaker 0: There's a lot of non-sequitur kind of crazy humor like that nowadays, but it's sort of like You know, where would that?

574
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:57,435
Speaker 1: that wouldn't be there if Monty Python wasn't there?

575
00:39:57,455 --> 00:40:05,622
Speaker 0: Yeah, you may be right I mean, it's hard to say but I think Monty Python is very heavily influenced a lot of comedy in the United States And in Britain.

576
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:11,720
Speaker 1: ever since you know Monty Python and all the surviving members of Monty Python have gone on to do other comedy things.

577
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,486
Speaker 0: One of them's dead.

578
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:20,978
Speaker 1: I know Yeah, they've all gone on to do separate things, you know all about influencing the arts in many ways.

579
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:32,740
Speaker 0: Yes I mean, of course, I don't know how many of you I mean I guess I might be described as a super fan because I know a lot about Monty Python and a lot of people can't seem to tell the difference between all the people in Monty Python.

580
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:35,140
Speaker 1: I can tell there's most of the people in Monty Python.

581
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:40,440
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I mean there's people that no one ever saw so so much and there's feel like John Cleese.

582
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,330
Speaker 0: Everyone knows cuz he did like all these movies afterward.

583
00:40:43,671 --> 00:40:46,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, Eric Idle acted a bunch of movies also.

584
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:54,903
Speaker 1: Yes, a Terry Gilliam is I think actually Eric Idle's best part in a non Monty Python role was I think there was a movie that was like You know my like.

585
00:40:55,244 --> 00:41:07,705
Speaker 1: it was like something about like parents and aliens or something like my parents or I forget exactly what it was But like he played a part of like a guy in a dungeon chained up and he just kind of was hanging on the wall Being all silly.

586
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:09,293
Speaker 1: I really like that.

587
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:13,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't know I was always a big fan of John Cleese partly because he could do silly walks.

588
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:22,077
Speaker 0: I think he's the only human being in the world qualified to do a silly walk And I think he's the only person in the world who I could see doing a silly walk and actually laugh.

589
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:36,360
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's just and I mean he's done a lot of great things afterward Like I said before but he put together and it's mostly just Monty Python skits But he kind of did the links between all of them called how to irritate people.

590
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:48,991
Speaker 0: I highly recommend it because it is basically half a bunch of Monty Python or Monty Python esque skits and half a very well done concise Explanation of how to irritate other human beings.

591
00:41:49,432 --> 00:41:50,095
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

592
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:52,227
Speaker 0: It's just it's great I know.

593
00:41:52,247 --> 00:41:59,220
Speaker 0: so in a fish called Wanda and Fierce creatures, which is kind of an homage to a fish called Wanda, which I think was actually a lot better.

594
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:04,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's also Terry Gilliam was very important because he did like all the like.

595
00:42:04,276 --> 00:42:14,720
Speaker 1: if you watch Flying Circus There's all these animations and things and even in like Holy Grail and such There'll be animations like in the movie and they're very the same sort of style as you'll see in yellow submarine.

596
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,030
Speaker 1: I think he had a hand in that too.

597
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:19,431
Speaker 1: Actually, I forget You know and he's sort of like.

598
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:20,540
Speaker 1: that's his animation.

599
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,404
Speaker 1: That's like he sort of.

600
00:42:21,424 --> 00:42:27,006
Speaker 1: I don't know if he invented it but like that's you know, people see that in the gods Terry Gilliam animation that's that is.

601
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:31,120
Speaker 1: and then he went on to make you know other movies and such like like Brazil, right?

602
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,508
Speaker 1: He made you made Brazil, right?

603
00:42:32,911 --> 00:42:39,639
Speaker 0: Yes, Brazil and He had a part in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas 12 monkeys trying to think of what else.

604
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:43,312
Speaker 1: He went on to be like a filmmaker after Monty Python was done.

605
00:42:43,412 --> 00:42:45,560
Speaker 1: It's a pretty important guy right there.

606
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:53,602
Speaker 0: Yes, of course I quick aside if anyone's seen the movie Brazil make sure you don't see the awful like kind of American.

607
00:42:53,622 --> 00:42:55,488
Speaker 0: oh it ended happily crap.

608
00:42:55,568 --> 00:42:55,989
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

609
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:56,992
Speaker 0: Yes.

610
00:42:57,012 --> 00:42:57,273
Speaker 0: He did.

611
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:59,078
Speaker 0: In fact direct Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

612
00:42:59,459 --> 00:42:59,820
Speaker 1: There you go.

613
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:02,710
Speaker 0: I wasn't 100% sure but I had to check.

614
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,503
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's not everyone is a fan of his later works But I am.

615
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:07,688
Speaker 1: yeah, I like him enough.

616
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:08,752
Speaker 0: I really like Brazil.

617
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:09,897
Speaker 0: a lot of people don't like Brazil.

618
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:12,267
Speaker 1: It's okay It wasn't great.

619
00:43:12,649 --> 00:43:13,757
Speaker 0: Well, I wasn't great about it.

620
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,252
Speaker 0: Hey, it was a little long.

621
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:20,168
Speaker 0: I'll give you that it didn't thrill me I don't know, but I think John Cleese is my favorite.

622
00:43:20,189 --> 00:43:20,449
Speaker 0: Of course.

623
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,680
Speaker 0: Graham Chapman is the guy who played none other than King Arthur.

624
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:26,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's uh, it was alcoholic.

625
00:43:27,091 --> 00:43:27,773
Speaker 0: Yes and dead.

626
00:43:27,793 --> 00:43:28,516
Speaker 0: Yeah.

627
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:38,590
Speaker 1: Well now he's dead Yes, but you'll you'll read many a tale of how he was drunk the whole time He was doing the King Arthur thing and yes like that He was also apparently very difficult to get along with.

628
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:42,607
Speaker 0: but all of that all the reports of that I read mostly coming from John Cleese.

629
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:45,438
Speaker 0: It was also reported as being very hard to get along with yeah.

630
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:53,080
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, actually the sudden it, you know The TV series, you know Flying Circus was how many seasons like five or six seasons?

631
00:43:53,160 --> 00:44:00,820
Speaker 0: I think it was five seasons, right and you know John Cleese wanted to leave after like a few seasons after like the half first half of the second season.

632
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:01,652
Speaker 0: He was like fuck you guys.

633
00:44:01,693 --> 00:44:08,060
Speaker 1: I'm gone Yeah, and you know cuz he thought that they were just repeating the same ideas over and over again or something like that.

634
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,725
Speaker 1: You know, he was.

635
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:20,430
Speaker 1: he's basically like, alright, we're done with this but he sort of stuck around for another season or so because they sort of made him kinda and then he left and he's not in like the Like final season or so of the show.

636
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,220
Speaker 0: the final season by the way is not nearly as good as the rest of it.

637
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:23,653
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

638
00:44:24,482 --> 00:44:29,540
Speaker 1: The thing I find interesting is if you watch those seasons where he didn't want to be there, but he was there.

639
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,759
Speaker 1: Anyway, he was still just as funny.

640
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:40,625
Speaker 0: Yeah The skits that he actually wrote or actually played a part in were amazing not to discredit any other Monty Python people because they were All great.

641
00:44:40,968 --> 00:44:41,209
Speaker 1: Yep.

642
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:43,338
Speaker 1: Oh Monty Python.

643
00:44:44,762 --> 00:44:47,313
Speaker 0: Actually, I don't know what else I could say other than descending back into.

644
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,940
Speaker 0: oh, I like tits.

645
00:44:49,341 --> 00:44:55,940
Speaker 1: Alright, let's let's go through like some of the best skits and parts of movies and things that are awesome.

646
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:56,524
Speaker 0: I don't know.

647
00:44:56,584 --> 00:44:59,060
Speaker 0: I really really like the Dennis Moore sketch.

648
00:45:00,086 --> 00:45:01,494
Speaker 1: I don't know the Dennis Moore thing.

649
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:07,450
Speaker 1: to be perfectly honest It's not really that funny, but it's just sort of so quotable with the Dennis Moore.

650
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:14,855
Speaker 1: Dennis Moore And the bleeding lupins The cats Bradley choked to death on him.

651
00:45:15,217 --> 00:45:18,718
Speaker 1: Yeah That part is just the fact that it's so I don't know.

652
00:45:19,902 --> 00:45:21,527
Speaker 1: You just talk about Dennis Moore all day.

653
00:45:21,587 --> 00:45:22,971
Speaker 0: Oh, could you yeah continue?

654
00:45:22,992 --> 00:45:24,797
Speaker 1: All right, Dennis Moore.

655
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:25,740
Speaker 1: He's dumb dumb dumb.

656
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:27,699
Speaker 0: What else do you got about Dennis Moore?

657
00:45:28,364 --> 00:45:29,755
Speaker 1: Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.

658
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:37,340
Speaker 1: all day All day He steals from the rage he gives to the poor Dennis Moore.

659
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:46,900
Speaker 0: I mean, it's funny because there's all the kind of classic like everyone knows the lumberjack skit or the the philosophers drinking song.

660
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:49,447
Speaker 1: No, what's the positive thing?

661
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:50,791
Speaker 0: song in it's the philosopher.

662
00:45:50,992 --> 00:45:51,533
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

663
00:45:51,553 --> 00:45:52,416
Speaker 1: I don't remember that one.

664
00:45:52,677 --> 00:45:53,860
Speaker 0: It's the philosophers drinking.

665
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,248
Speaker 0: Immanuel Kant was a real pissant who was very rarely stable.

666
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:57,830
Speaker 1: Yeah.

667
00:45:58,051 --> 00:45:58,372
Speaker 1: Okay.

668
00:45:58,492 --> 00:45:59,716
Speaker 1: I didn't know what it was called.

669
00:45:59,736 --> 00:46:02,166
Speaker 0: I Think you could have figured it out.

670
00:46:02,548 --> 00:46:04,999
Speaker 0: the philosophers drinking song.

671
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,735
Speaker 0: Immanuel Kant was a real pissant who was very rarely stay.

672
00:46:09,755 --> 00:46:11,040
Speaker 0: I think you could have put two and two together.

673
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:15,286
Speaker 1: No, no, I wasn't, you know, okay, there's so much of it You can't keep it all in the mind all at once.

674
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:15,828
Speaker 0: Yes, you can.

675
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:16,892
Speaker 0: No, I think it's.

676
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:29,348
Speaker 0: I've got two legs from my hips To the ground and when I move them they walk around and when I lift and they climb the stairs and When I shave them, they ain't got hairs.

677
00:46:29,669 --> 00:46:29,830
Speaker 1: Yep.

678
00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:34,227
Speaker 0: I Think the show is done.

679
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:35,013
Speaker 0: What are we gonna say?

680
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:35,880
Speaker 0: I don't know.

681
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,387
Speaker 1: It's just like it feels like.

682
00:46:37,588 --> 00:46:39,156
Speaker 1: what can we say other than sort of?

683
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:48,080
Speaker 1: researching and telling you more details of the history and amazingness of Monty Python or just Quoting it incessantly for a long time?

684
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:49,558
Speaker 1: What you know, what else can we do?

685
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,879
Speaker 0: I mean other than as a public service announcement if you're a geek?

686
00:46:53,617 --> 00:46:53,801
Speaker 0: No not.

687
00:46:53,821 --> 00:47:02,416
Speaker 1: if you're a geek anyone listening to this show who has not seen all Three of the major Monty Python movies and as much of the TV show as you can get your hands on.

688
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:03,600
Speaker 1: you have a problem.

689
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:05,734
Speaker 1: You just you got to see it all.

690
00:47:05,835 --> 00:47:06,580
Speaker 0: I mean seriously.

691
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,911
Speaker 1: There's no way that you're not gonna like it.

692
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:10,940
Speaker 0: Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

693
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:13,891
Speaker 1: If you ever met anyone ever who has said I don't I at.

694
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:17,828
Speaker 1: they had they have seen Monty Python and they actively Did not like it.

695
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:20,280
Speaker 1: they were like, I hate Monty Python at least the Holy Grail.

696
00:47:20,802 --> 00:47:21,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean no one.

697
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,997
Speaker 1: I've never met such a person pretty much as far as I'm concerned.

698
00:47:25,017 --> 00:47:25,619
Speaker 1: There are people who?

699
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,370
Speaker 1: Find Monty Python hilarious and people have never seen it.

700
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:29,771
Speaker 1: That's it.

701
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:32,360
Speaker 0: I mean my the Holy Grail.

702
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:38,416
Speaker 0: I've seen it so many times but the movie is like the greatest comedy film ever made.

703
00:47:38,637 --> 00:47:42,739
Speaker 1: your mother was a hamster And your father smelt of elderberries.

704
00:47:43,581 --> 00:47:47,036
Speaker 1: Who writes something like that doesn't matter but it's really funny.

705
00:47:47,076 --> 00:47:49,531
Speaker 1: when you're in middle school There's a bunch of fart jokes, but you know what?

706
00:47:49,592 --> 00:47:51,537
Speaker 0: It's still funny now I don't know what it is.

707
00:47:51,941 --> 00:48:00,675
Speaker 0: And actually the funny thing is you talk to a lot of geeks and they can quote the movie Practically verbatim like the whole movie and you think oh, they can't quote.

708
00:48:00,956 --> 00:48:03,791
Speaker 0: No the whole movie I mean some day loud.

709
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:08,173
Speaker 0: all this would be yours, but the cut All that you can see but mother father.

710
00:48:08,213 --> 00:48:12,434
Speaker 0: I don't want tracks of Land, I don't want to sing.

711
00:48:12,635 --> 00:48:20,000
Speaker 0: Oh stop that You stay here and make sure you don't be sure that doesn't leave.

712
00:48:20,885 --> 00:48:21,328
Speaker 0: Are you going?

713
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:22,274
Speaker 0: we're coming with you, sir.

714
00:48:22,294 --> 00:48:29,520
Speaker 0: No, no God, but I realized a lot of geeks have not seen the movie in recent memory.

715
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,906
Speaker 0: That's just criminal But I haven't seen it recently.

716
00:48:31,946 --> 00:48:35,680
Speaker 0: the last I haven't seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail in like a decade.

717
00:48:36,385 --> 00:48:42,674
Speaker 1: I've seen it in more recently than a decade But it's been a few years and I feel like I kind of want to extol.

718
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,720
Speaker 1: is it on Netflix Honda man?

719
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:54,780
Speaker 0: I feel like what needs to be done is all of you out there who have not seen this movie recently Should get all your geeky friends together and watch all of us.

720
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:03,259
Speaker 0: We'll do it to Monty Python and the Holy Grail Because you forget how funny that movie was and also how fucked up that movie was.

721
00:49:03,299 --> 00:49:04,743
Speaker 1: Yeah I should mention this.

722
00:49:05,024 --> 00:49:07,411
Speaker 1: the Broadway shows spam a lot which man.

723
00:49:07,853 --> 00:49:19,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you seen Holy Grail It's like you go and it's like oh, it's sort of the same jokes as Holy Grail But with some singing and dance, they had to walk a really fine line because if they just did Holy Grail Everyone knows it verbatim.

724
00:49:20,086 --> 00:49:23,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if they stray too far people going will go.

725
00:49:23,198 --> 00:49:23,820
Speaker 0: what the hell was that?

726
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,924
Speaker 0: That wasn't the Holy Grail.

727
00:49:25,286 --> 00:49:26,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's just sort of like.

728
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:28,260
Speaker 1: yeah, it's exactly what you'd expect.

729
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:34,953
Speaker 1: It's a. it's a Broadway production using many of the same jokes as Holy Grail with some new added jokes and singing and dancing.

730
00:49:35,398 --> 00:49:38,105
Speaker 1: and You know, it's not bad You know, it's just.

731
00:49:38,466 --> 00:49:44,618
Speaker 1: you're not gonna be lying and rolling around in the floor if you've seen Holy Grail before But if you haven't seen Holy Grail a lot of it will make no sense to you.

732
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:46,226
Speaker 1: So it is what it is.

733
00:49:46,246 --> 00:49:53,160
Speaker 0: I think the target audience of that was someone who had seen the Holy Grail Like once when they were a child and had otherwise forgotten about it.

734
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,169
Speaker 1: I think that is the person who can enjoy that Broadway show the most.

735
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:59,600
Speaker 0: I can say one thing that nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

736
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:05,448
Speaker 0: Remember our Surprise yeah, and remember our promo.

737
00:50:05,648 --> 00:50:08,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the promos he made was the Spanish Inquisition promo.

738
00:50:08,961 --> 00:50:11,570
Speaker 0: It was it was bad bad.

739
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:13,618
Speaker 0: Well podcast promos in general are bad.

740
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:14,019
Speaker 0: You know what?

741
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,787
Speaker 0: Podcast should not be playing promos.

742
00:50:16,907 --> 00:50:17,409
Speaker 0: It's over.

743
00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:17,951
Speaker 0: Stop it.

744
00:50:18,051 --> 00:50:18,633
Speaker 0: Seriously.

745
00:50:18,673 --> 00:50:19,035
Speaker 0: God.

746
00:50:19,155 --> 00:50:20,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm done with the promos pretty much.

747
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,332
Speaker 0: We haven't played promos in a long time because I think there's a dumb idea.

748
00:50:23,352 --> 00:50:24,456
Speaker 1: I think they're pretty dumb.

749
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:25,300
Speaker 1: I mean the pride.

750
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:29,860
Speaker 1: Getting someone who listens to another podcast to listen to yours isn't really gonna help you out.

751
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,375
Speaker 1: You need to get people who don't listen to podcasts to listen to podcasts.

752
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:37,100
Speaker 1: That is the key You know, I just remembered just like getting it's not you're not gonna.

753
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:40,960
Speaker 1: You know You don't need to convince someone who watches one Monty Python movie to watch another one.

754
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:43,835
Speaker 1: You need to get someone who doesn't watch any Monty Pythons and watch some.

755
00:50:44,016 --> 00:50:45,503
Speaker 0: I'll admit though I didn't like.

756
00:50:45,563 --> 00:50:48,575
Speaker 0: meaning a life that much see uh meaning a life.

757
00:50:48,675 --> 00:50:53,120
Speaker 1: It has some Really amazing parts like why and that has them also.

758
00:50:53,441 --> 00:51:02,590
Speaker 0: the only thing that ask anyone who's seen that movie and all they remember is the opening movie and then But it's way far thin.

759
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:03,192
Speaker 1: That's it.

760
00:51:03,232 --> 00:51:05,885
Speaker 1: That's the best part is the way for thin part But what else?

761
00:51:05,905 --> 00:51:08,058
Speaker 1: the second best part is where they?

762
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:14,538
Speaker 1: He's teaching them in the class about you know, like how to do foreplay and such.

763
00:51:14,558 --> 00:51:15,260
Speaker 0: That was okay.

764
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:16,965
Speaker 1: Is the part where they're in?

765
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:21,238
Speaker 1: there is it was nowhere near the jungle and there's the tiger.

766
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:26,740
Speaker 0: oh whatever It was nowhere near the quality of the cycling tour Forget what it's called.

767
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:42,240
Speaker 0: but that one skit where a guy like goes to a house and he's waiting for like someone's like like the butler takes him like wait in this room and so and so will be down in a minute and he's standing there and then just like a Vase falls off the shelf completely by itself and breaks and the butler comes in.

768
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,227
Speaker 0: I was just standing here and it fell.

769
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:49,877
Speaker 0: the butler's looks at him with his look of sure sure you were just standing there But I'm a butler's I'm just gonna clean it up.

770
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,005
Speaker 0: He's like no But I really didn't cry whatever.

771
00:51:52,527 --> 00:52:00,386
Speaker 0: and then the butler leaves and then like a shelf falls over And the butler comes back and is looking at the guy like he's crazy you guys seriously didn't do anything.

772
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:07,380
Speaker 0: and it escalates and eventually he accidentally stabs like the Man, that sketch is so crunchy frog.

773
00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:08,888
Speaker 0: Ah crunchy frog.

774
00:52:08,948 --> 00:52:11,060
Speaker 0: not the best sketch but pretty good overall.

775
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:14,851
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a it's a. it's got some lasting memorableness.

776
00:52:14,871 --> 00:52:18,140
Speaker 0: I mean you can forget spams spams spams spams spams.

777
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:25,536
Speaker 0: I don't like spams spams spams spams spams spams back akins and bam akins.

778
00:52:25,597 --> 00:52:27,040
Speaker 0: and yeah, I killed that one.

779
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:27,864
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also.

780
00:52:27,904 --> 00:52:36,884
Speaker 1: I like there's a whole episode with the Dinsdale Table.

781
00:52:37,065 --> 00:52:38,110
Speaker 1: oh, no, it's a wonderful man.

782
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:38,412
Speaker 1: Wonderful.

783
00:52:38,673 --> 00:52:39,618
Speaker 0: We're doing it again.

784
00:52:39,779 --> 00:52:45,308
Speaker 0: Yeah This is the reason we were so afraid of doing this show because it's movies You should see as this problem.

785
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:53,122
Speaker 0: all the time or whenever they do a funny movie You can't help but just turn it into a quote fest cuz what are you gonna say other than yeah, it was really funny It was.

786
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,610
Speaker 1: it's all really really really funny.

787
00:52:55,731 --> 00:52:56,594
Speaker 0: It's so funny.

788
00:52:56,614 --> 00:52:58,380
Speaker 0: I don't know what else I can say.

789
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,567

790
00:53:00,587 --> 00:53:02,514
