1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:22,605
Speaker 1: It's a Monday April 2 3. they say oh, I'm Scott I'm rim Geek nice time and the show is on.

2
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,388
Speaker 1: I don't know what the fuck.

3
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:25,129
Speaker 1: the title this show?

4
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:33,993
Speaker 0: Principled idealism versus pragmatic reality.

5
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,139
Speaker 0: sleepy time the show.

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,856
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:43,080
Speaker 0: Usually you're the one yelling at me saying hey the openers way too long.

8
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:48,624
Speaker 1: It would have been it would have been the right length if you didn't make the title so long As opposed to nothing.

9
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:50,210
Speaker 1: that's nothing would have been very short.

10
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,780
Speaker 1: the shortest in fact none shorter.

11
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,397
Speaker 0: So I did you know kind of a more short.

12
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,100
Speaker 0: now We've already done the book club show and I don't really want to do a separate review of the movie.

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,400
Speaker 0: But I did see the Hunger Games movie, and it was a solid beef lick.

14
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:05,558
Speaker 0: Pretty good.

15
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:13,333
Speaker 1: re-watched the Lord of the Rings Which I probably hadn't seen in its entirety since the theater.

16
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:14,818
Speaker 1: wait so all three leave it or not?

17
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:18,651
Speaker 1: 12 hours Yeah, believe it or not was in 2003 was the last one.

18
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:19,393
Speaker 0: Yeah.

19
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:20,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's some good shit.

20
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:27,372
Speaker 1: Yo Like the best Pretty good it comes to you at the turn of the tide.

21
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:28,275
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

22
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:29,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

23
00:01:30,242 --> 00:01:31,509
Speaker 1: That was like all right this.

24
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,843
Speaker 0: yeah, you know to this day My whole life.

25
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:37,953
Speaker 0: I have said any time something comes anywhere.

26
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:42,287
Speaker 0: I usually say at the town of the tide Even before those movies.

27
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:45,217
Speaker 1: It's just on the dawn of the fifth day.

28
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:45,920
Speaker 1: look to the east.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,843
Speaker 1: What's taters?

30
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,569
Speaker 1: yeah, no okay, no.

31
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,278
Speaker 0: no I think I say that about as often as I say.

32
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:54,880
Speaker 0: turn of the tide.

33
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,773
Speaker 0: No, I did not say it until the movies.

34
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:57,015
Speaker 0: fair.

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,869
Speaker 0: Anyway anyway Got a news.

36
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:04,460
Speaker 1: all right, let's just jump to news captain.

37
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:09,050
Speaker 1: So Intel came out with the new chips the potato variety.

38
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:18,471
Speaker 0: yep, not the very salty not the potato variety also, not the Crazy, I don't know the rumor sites up until the announcement.

39
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:19,394
Speaker 0: We're doing the usual.

40
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,300
Speaker 0: This is gonna be like nothing.

41
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:24,340
Speaker 0: People were talking about crazy.

42
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:31,647
Speaker 1: All the non crazy sites were saying the same thing and then in the reviews now that they actually have it They're pretty much saying the same thing.

43
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,133
Speaker 1: and this is what went down right.

44
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:40,680
Speaker 1: so they had Sandy Bridge and now the new one is Ivy Bridge, so do not buy Sandy Bridge otherwise right now.

45
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,758
Speaker 0: Otherwise you are dumb yep, and as of this morning when I looked at Newegg they cost about the same.

46
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,454
Speaker 1: well Yeah, that's pretty much how it goes.

47
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:49,325
Speaker 1: so Basically here's the deal.

48
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:56,100
Speaker 1: It's Smaller and way more energy efficient.

49
00:02:56,421 --> 00:03:01,360
Speaker 1: So if you got like a laptop or a netbook or something hot shit that batteries gonna be lasting way longer.

50
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:06,680
Speaker 0: I'm going away fast pretty much waiting on buying a new laptop until there's a new Lenovo that uses these things.

51
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,007
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time.

52
00:03:09,168 --> 00:03:11,896
Speaker 1: It's like how much faster is it than the Sandy Bridge?

53
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:14,348
Speaker 1: not that much faster I mean, it's quad-core.

54
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:20,894
Speaker 1: It's a thing is like 15% Faster, but it's not so much faster like if you've got a sandy bridge.

55
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:22,238
Speaker 1: You should not upgrade.

56
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:23,060
Speaker 1: You're just blowing Scott.

57
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:40,513
Speaker 0: I got a core i7 920 from before they'd renumbered it yep, and it is yet to be the bottleneck on anything I've ever done including HD video editing my hard drives Benchmarks that were comparing like you know video encoding and game playing.

58
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:48,500
Speaker 1: upgrading my video card has more effect than anything Yeah, and it showed like graphs like comparing the benchmark of the previous and the current i7 and the difference.

59
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,073
Speaker 1: It's like it's faster, but it's like a tiny bit faster.

60
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:52,440
Speaker 1: It's like it's not gonna change your life.

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,982
Speaker 1: It's not worth $300.

62
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,432
Speaker 0: Yeah, my i7 920.

63
00:03:55,432 --> 00:03:57,320
Speaker 0: I think is gonna last me another two years.

64
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, my I got a core to do.

65
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,975
Speaker 1: Oh, I expect it to last me another year or two.

66
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:10,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, right That might not suffice if you actually want to record the entirety of that stupid bike race in 1080p and then edit it It'll be fun.

67
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:11,798
Speaker 0: You will see.

68
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:16,611
Speaker 1: Anyway, but the big job the other big thing about this is they up.

69
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,683
Speaker 1: the integrated Intel GPU that's in there is Significantly better.

70
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:22,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard it was marginally better.

71
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,955
Speaker 1: Okay, it's still.

72
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:24,597
Speaker 1: here's the thing.

73
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:25,340
Speaker 1: It's still shit.

74
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:27,408
Speaker 1: It's an Intel integrated GPU.

75
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,370
Speaker 1: It's still shit, but it is Significantly better than the 3000. so it's like before.

76
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:41,500
Speaker 1: you had sort of like this sort of runny almost diarrhea And now you've got like a consistent normal healthy piece of poop.

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:49,387
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I need that how it is still because I you know for laptops like I ran into a problem that our conventions I'm gonna.

78
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:55,920
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do a Linux like straight-up install on my old laptop now because that laptops near an end-of-life anyway.

79
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,351
Speaker 1: But the new Ubuntu is apparently really good.

80
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,100
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Conrad I saw his tweet about it.

81
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,251
Speaker 0: So that's what I'm gonna put on there.

82
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:01,878
Speaker 0: just to see.

83
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:05,760
Speaker 0: It can serve really good most HD videos.

84
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:16,878
Speaker 0: But if I encode an HD video that has a high maximum bitrate and a two pass VBR PCs play it fine that laptop cannot play it.

85
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:21,120
Speaker 1: Maybe it has to do with like the size of the something like this.

86
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:30,860
Speaker 1: You know if the bit rate is high then at a point in the video if the bit rate is variable where there are lots Of bits maybe it's greater than like a certain spot and the memory can't hold all the bits.

87
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:33,440
Speaker 0: So I did a little bit of performance profiling.

88
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:37,709
Speaker 1: Maybe the memory isn't fast enough and it can't push Straight up.

89
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:47,190
Speaker 0: when I play an HD video Like a modern one like get an MKV from like a current blu-ray release of something on the Pirate Bay It maxes out the CPU and it stutters every now and then.

90
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:55,280
Speaker 0: so I think it's just the fact that it's like a Centrino because I bought that laptop when I still learned in the hospital.

91
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:58,812
Speaker 1: I three played, you know, my i3 HD PC played.

92
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:01,020
Speaker 1: Lord of the Rings Scott Ray rips just fine.

93
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,685
Speaker 0: I think I bought that laptop in 2005.

94
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:04,812
Speaker 1: All right, that's not too bad.

95
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:07,380
Speaker 0: might have been 2006 maybe seven at the latest.

96
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:19,680
Speaker 1: I know I drove to that FedEx after driving home stupid goddamn play Anyway from beacon, but yeah, basically apparently according to all these articles Intel has like a tick-tock strategy, right?

97
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,352
Speaker 1: So it's like tick is like, you know, though for one generation of CPUs They'll be like little update like tick and then the next generation talk like big update.

98
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:30,160
Speaker 1: They're calling this generation tick plus.

99
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:33,211
Speaker 1: So it's like yeah, it's it's a small update.

100
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,215
Speaker 1: But wait a minute.

101
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:34,657
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

102
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:35,500
Speaker 0: Wait a minute Intel.

103
00:06:36,084 --> 00:06:36,850
Speaker 0: So you're doing so.

104
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:53,660
Speaker 0: here's the thing I don't like about the technology industry that they seem to change the numbering of various products Semi arbitrarily to make it as impossible as possibly possible to understand Whether or not something is better than something else.

105
00:06:54,402 --> 00:07:00,500
Speaker 1: If there was just clear numbering of what if you could just be like this Intel is better and right cuz Lex more.

106
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,469
Speaker 1: Let's pretend I had was a CPU company right and the first CPU I ever made was the one And the next one I made was the two.

107
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:10,240
Speaker 1: and then the next one I made was actually two times better than the two.

108
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:17,000
Speaker 1: So instead of calling it a three I called it the four Right, and actually the numbering was pretty equivalent to how much better it was fine.

109
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:21,620
Speaker 1: So something was a hundred times as powerful as the one I'd call it the hundred right and I num.

110
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:25,981
Speaker 1: I'd called all my products this, you know, the Scott 100 the Scott 200.

111
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:33,890
Speaker 1: You would look at the prices and you would look at the numbers and with math that even dumb people could do you could be That is the one to buy and that is the only one that would.

112
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:42,530
Speaker 0: so instead I'll release a GTS 2700 X and a GT 2750 and they cost about the same.

113
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,520
Speaker 1: and how do you know which one to buy?

114
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,960
Speaker 0: Well, you go to Tom's Hardware and look at benchmarks and guess right but the thing is it comes down to like your chip factory.

115
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:51,675
Speaker 1: Not all the chips come out as good.

116
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:56,707
Speaker 1: I know Oh, I made this chip and I you know, I got to get my yields But I have no problem with binning.

117
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,897
Speaker 0: that is a natural part of right.

118
00:07:58,917 --> 00:07:59,560
Speaker 1: So here's the thing.

119
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
Speaker 1: Okay, so I manufacture all these chips.

120
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:05,711
Speaker 1: Let's just say for you know The sake of whatever half of them come out perfect and half of them.

121
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:08,020
Speaker 1: there's one part that's busted but they still work.

122
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,687
Speaker 1: They're just a feature that won't work.

123
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:12,900
Speaker 1: So now I've got to sell all of these chips to make maximum money.

124
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,253
Speaker 1: I'm not just gonna throw half of them away.

125
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:14,940
Speaker 1: That would be stupid.

126
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:17,731
Speaker 1: So now how do I sell that other half?

127
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:25,456
Speaker 1: and I so I could just say okay How much is that feature worth in money and performance wise and give it a different number accordingly?

128
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:26,459
Speaker 1: So it's sort of honest.

129
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,292
Speaker 1: or I Could sort of jigger the numbering so you're not quite sure.

130
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:35,179
Speaker 1: and then all these sites are arguing over the need for that feature.

131
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:39,203
Speaker 0: That's disabled on those GT Yeah, and then benchmarks don't even help you.

132
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:42,169
Speaker 0: right you have to have a custom benchmark for that exactly.

133
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:47,037
Speaker 1: and then Suddenly, I'm selling both of these at the same price even when I should always go.

134
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:51,958
Speaker 0: I should have clarified Non-profiteering evil bullshit reason to do this.

135
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,125
Speaker 0: But this annoys me in general.

136
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:02,956
Speaker 0: but Intel had a simple like tick tock tick plus.

137
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,260
Speaker 0: next you're gonna have tick GX.

138
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:06,094
Speaker 1: Well, it's gonna be clock with double plus.

139
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:09,823
Speaker 0: We're gonna have tock 5,000 and then tick 5050.

140
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:13,880
Speaker 1: right, but basically that's their strategy is one of one generation is gonna be a small update.

141
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,931
Speaker 1: The next one is a big update small update big update.

142
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:17,358
Speaker 1: So, you know, I got a core to duo.

143
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,708
Speaker 1: It still works really well.

144
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:20,009
Speaker 1: Nothing.

145
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,254
Speaker 1: I have no problems whatsoever.

146
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:21,435
Speaker 1: Mike.

147
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:23,503
Speaker 0: I got a core i7 920 it.

148
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:25,609
Speaker 0: I've never maxed it out doing anything

149
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:39,018
Speaker 1: right, but you know what when that talk hits in about a year or two Probably gonna get you know I'll just replace the motherboard the CPU the memory and the video card and I'll get like, you know the maximum talk with like.

150
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,551
Speaker 0: probably You're gonna get the second best time.

151
00:09:43,672 --> 00:09:45,580
Speaker 1: Oh, well, yeah, I'm not gonna buy the stupid thousand dollar extreme.

152
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:48,271
Speaker 0: That doesn't get three hundred and fifty dollars.

153
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,938
Speaker 1: you believe they even sell those like you.

154
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:50,440
Speaker 1: go on Newegg.

155
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,049
Speaker 1: There are people who buy those the thousand dollar CPU.

156
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:56,400
Speaker 0: That's like a one one percent faster faster than and will be.

157
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:58,465
Speaker 0: It'll be commodity.

158
00:09:58,485 --> 00:09:59,269
Speaker 0: in like.

159
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:00,534
Speaker 1: the $300 one's the best one.

160
00:10:00,555 --> 00:10:01,278
Speaker 1: That's the one you should get.

161
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:03,844
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm gonna wait.

162
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:05,050
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna skip this tick.

163
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:08,644
Speaker 0: I'm gonna skip the next talk Following talk.

164
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:11,717
Speaker 1: That's what you should get because my 920 is going strong.

165
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:16,835
Speaker 1: by that time I'll probably be getting like 16 gigs of RAM and a who-knows-what video card.

166
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:18,160
Speaker 0: I've got 12 gigs now.

167
00:10:19,843 --> 00:10:21,291
Speaker 0: I've got 12 gigs of RAM now.

168
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,498
Speaker 0: I got four.

169
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:25,767
Speaker 0: Wow But see laptop.

170
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:28,980
Speaker 0: wise, you know, remember I bought my laptop.

171
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:34,760
Speaker 0: I spent like three grand on that thing because that was before there were netbooks and I bought an ultra portable.

172
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:36,371
Speaker 0: That was you know back in that day.

173
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:41,390
Speaker 0: ultra portable meant it Performs as well as a gigantic laptop and is tiny.

174
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,811
Speaker 1: Yep.

175
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:45,140
Speaker 1: Now you don't have to know they call that ultra book now.

176
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, I paid a premium for that thing and it lasted a long time, but it is that end-of-life.

177
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,631
Speaker 0: I have to buy a laptop.

178
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,784
Speaker 0: It cannot work anymore Which I'm sad.

179
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:59,420
Speaker 0: I wanted to hold out longer, but at the same time this laptop lasted forever.

180
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:05,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, relative to what I paid I mean, I bought mine a little bit before yours and I upgraded it a little bit before you did.

181
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,907
Speaker 1: Laptops lasted about the same time.

182
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bought literally the next generation of the same laptop.

183
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:15,646
Speaker 1: Well, the next generation of the laptop I have now is already available So you're gonna get two generations ahead.

184
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:20,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you wait for like the X, who knows what the X 220 at work It's pretty great.

185
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:22,770
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, I'm gonna get the next x 220.

186
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,392
Speaker 0: Whatever is next.

187
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:29,874
Speaker 1: Well, it'll probably be x 221 or x. The thing is they already had x 300 right.

188
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:30,999
Speaker 1: x 300 is the bigger one.

189
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:35,880
Speaker 1: So it's like they had to make like the x 230 or the x 221 or who knows what I don't know.

190
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:37,767
Speaker 0: I'll do my research when the time comes.

191
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:45,428
Speaker 1: it'll probably be x 221 which would probably be exactly the same as x 220 just with The newer Intel chips, I think early fall Which would be a great fucking computer.

192
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:47,820
Speaker 0: early fall is the longest I can wait because I can't.

193
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,160
Speaker 0: Right now if we show videos at cons, we're relying on your laptop until I get a new one.

194
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,228
Speaker 0: That's fine, which is fine, but it reduces our redundancy.

195
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,031
Speaker 1: It does.

196
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,337
Speaker 1: Anyway, do you have any news?

197
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:00,240
Speaker 0: I do so.

198
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:16,708
Speaker 0: Not a lot of people have been talking about this compared to how many people I thought would be talking about it, but basically, the story here is that Larry Page and James Cameron Titanic guy the movie director.

199
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:25,660
Speaker 0: Yes, Ross perot's son the Ross perot's son Okay guy who is the Mars mission manager for NASA?

200
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:31,032
Speaker 0: Okay, and the guy who does the X Prize and some other people have all got.

201
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:37,593
Speaker 0: so basically that's a wild bunch basically a bunch of Billionaires rich white guys and multi-million.

202
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:38,899
Speaker 1: are any of them not men?

203
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:41,267
Speaker 1: No, are any of them not white?

204
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:42,312
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

205
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,658
Speaker 0: Okay, who's got?

206
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:45,408
Speaker 0: I've got That last part.

207
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,060
Speaker 0: who've gotten together and said you know what?

208
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:53,700
Speaker 0: We are gonna fund a robotic mission to capture and mine a fucking asteroid in space.

209
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:55,705
Speaker 1: That's pretty badass.

210
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:56,970
Speaker 0: now why?

211
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,074
Speaker 1: so what kind of men?

212
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,885
Speaker 1: things that they think are on the end, okay Well, here's the thing.

213
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:04,680
Speaker 0: I was talking about this at work actually a lot because the space shuttle flyover today got cancelled.

214
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,436
Speaker 0: So we're talking about space and there's some former NASA at my company.

215
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:09,260
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of.

216
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:20,280
Speaker 0: Okay, it's got you realize pretty much Most of the successful people in the financial world now were engineers for either the military or NASA.

217
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:23,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, there's no money in doing that.

218
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:25,205
Speaker 1: Look at the NASA budget.

219
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:28,640
Speaker 1: Yep, but basically, you know where the money is working for the bank.

220
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:35,018
Speaker 0: I will make an argument that skips all the specifics of this one tax dollars aren't funding it.

221
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:35,720
Speaker 0: So who cares?

222
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,483
Speaker 1: I care.

223
00:13:36,745 --> 00:13:43,067
Speaker 1: why cuz some guys stupid wasting his money So - he could be doing something better with it Even if this is not like giving it to me.

224
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:56,633
Speaker 0: if they capture these asteroids and they mine them and they do stuff with them And they don't get a return on their multi-billion dollar investment a direct one I think it's still fine because the in my opinion.

225
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:58,680
Speaker 1: Well, we'll discover a lot of things in the process.

226
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,322
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

227
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:04,900
Speaker 0: space travel space exploration all these things right now are not theoretical problems.

228
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,460
Speaker 0: The theoretical problems in space travel are so far beyond what we're looking at right now.

229
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:14,439
Speaker 0: I mean theoretical questions are things like speed of light and wormholes.

230
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:22,860
Speaker 0: space is an engineering problem and History has shown that the only way to advance engineering in a field like this?

231
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,700
Speaker 0: Do it is to try something crazy and go for it?

232
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,180
Speaker 0: Yep That is the only reason I want this to happen because see I gotta say something people haven't said right?

233
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:40,400
Speaker 1: Yes, people have been concentrating on the fact that like oh my god It cost two bajillion dollars to go get an asteroid and it's only got like half a million dollars worth of rock.

234
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,583
Speaker 0: Well, here's one big point.

235
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:52,800
Speaker 0: people forget that even if before I want to head you off if you're doing stuff in space with it That is so much cheaper than launching that much stuff into orbit - that is true.

236
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:54,440
Speaker 1: But here is another thing, right?

237
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,212
Speaker 1: now Those rocks ain't worth shit But you wait for the day when there's no rocks left on earth.

238
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,820
Speaker 1: Those space rocks are gonna be worth a fortune.

239
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:12,340
Speaker 1: So you'll be like in the year 3000. it'll be like, okay It cost only because we developed this technology a long time ago.

240
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:14,940
Speaker 1: It only costs a million dollars to get a space rock.

241
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:20,400
Speaker 1: But because there's no rocks left on earth the space rock is worth a trillion dollars.

242
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:22,430
Speaker 0: Now one way to look at this.

243
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,528
Speaker 1: or like you're playing Starcraft and there's no mod There's no little blue rocks left on the sky.

244
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,737
Speaker 1: Say how much would you pay for more blue rocks?

245
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:32,416
Speaker 0: Yes Here's me say we're making a moon base, right?

246
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,979
Speaker 0: Yeah How many how much how many?

247
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,399
Speaker 0: Resources would it cost us as humans on earth to send enough stuff into space to maintain that thing forever and build it?

248
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:49,892
Speaker 0: five coffee and a tobacco versus capturing asteroids putting them in an orbit of the moon and Manufacturing it all in space.

249
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:50,879
Speaker 1: That's six doubloons.

250
00:15:51,744 --> 00:16:01,640
Speaker 0: second And this is the cool part Material science is I think the next big sort of like fundamental other than it's already pretty big.

251
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,947
Speaker 0: No, no, I mean other than augmented reality.

252
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:08,580
Speaker 0: I think the other thing that's already sort of done already - what do you mean done already?

253
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,230
Speaker 1: You don't even know what I'm saying.

254
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:25,208
Speaker 0: We got that shit barely, what I'm saying is that augmented reality as it becomes mainstream and as the sort of Like as this accelerated rate of advancement reaches this point where it is, you know, it starts, you know It's sort of like combinatorial complexity.

255
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:30,840
Speaker 0: when we get to that point with augmented reality I think it's gonna change society in crazy fundamental ways.

256
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:38,513
Speaker 1: I think material society of our people who have access to it The society of all the other people is still gonna be fall even farther behind.

257
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:42,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a greater cultural Divergence and such.

258
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,235
Speaker 0: that's a separate problem.

259
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:48,012
Speaker 1: I wasn't worrying about it The number one problem we have that we encounter in our everyday lives.

260
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:59,301
Speaker 0: the second part though is I think Advances in like fundamental material science research are going to revolutionize society just as much they already have and will continue to do So.

261
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:08,166
Speaker 0: I think that the they they already have of the last decade will have nothing on like the few years After we start manufacturing things in space.

262
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:11,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, you think we'll do stuff even better than like carbon fiber and aerogel.

263
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:15,718
Speaker 0: I think carbon fiber and aerogel will be has bends within a decade.

264
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:16,300
Speaker 1: That's good.

265
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,240
Speaker 1: What could it possible be pot and how quickly possibly make better than like carbon fiber?

266
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,924
Speaker 0: What could science possibly do?

267
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:25,855
Speaker 0: tubes better than the automatic horse carriage?

268
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:27,680
Speaker 0: What could science possibly do for me?

269
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:29,339
Speaker 1: Well, can you can't even imagine?

270
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,962
Speaker 0: So imagine this.

271
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:36,879
Speaker 0: imagine a skyscraper that we just grow organically and is held up by like one.

272
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,045
Speaker 0: We've already imagined.

273
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,112
Speaker 1: we already imagined that.

274
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:40,339
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we haven't built it yet.

275
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:46,688
Speaker 1: I have since the 2000 about the whole screen Nothing but you can see nothing but that.

276
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:55,463
Speaker 0: so my point on all this is that if you manufacture stuff in space because there isn't the pesky influence of gravity and Atmosphere.

277
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:58,659
Speaker 0: you can do things that we can't do here.

278
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:04,000
Speaker 0: You could start to manufacture fundamentally new kinds of materials in really interesting ways.

279
00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:06,913
Speaker 1: Yes, and no right cuz like I don't take for example.

280
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:10,880
Speaker 1: Let's say you want to Forge some items, right?

281
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:20,776
Speaker 1: Well on the one hand you don't have gravity so it's really easy to lift a heavy thing to smash down on it Right, but on the other hand is no gravity to pull it down and do the smashing Scott.

282
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:22,404
Speaker 0: That's not the part I'm talking.

283
00:18:22,445 --> 00:18:24,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, you need to make no no Scott.

284
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:30,928
Speaker 0: I'm talking about things like certain crystalline structures only form in zero-gravity environments Certain kinds of my growing.

285
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,408
Speaker 0: imagine growing just diamonds in space Also coating things right.

286
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:51,670
Speaker 0: if you're like spraying stuff you can spray it real even like Wow, I can't really express to you, but I'm sure the listeners might get it how far I am Overshooting your ideas in terms of what is possible.

287
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:58,100
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'm like we'll build space diamond colonies And you're like we'll put that spray paint on a real fucking good.

288
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:00,609
Speaker 1: You can get like a centrifuge to spin.

289
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,155
Speaker 1: so perfect spinning.

290
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,560
Speaker 0: anyway summarize my point.

291
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,446
Speaker 0: We did a show on this before men.

292
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:07,593
Speaker 0: space research is not useful right now.

293
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:13,620
Speaker 0: stuff like this is awesome And I fully support this endeavor even if it is a complete failure and someone else's money.

294
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,230
Speaker 1: But hey, I'd rather have them give me the money.

295
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:16,680
Speaker 0: So what are you gonna do with it?

296
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,944
Speaker 0: Sit on a tropical island.

297
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:18,827
Speaker 0: Yeah.

298
00:19:18,987 --> 00:19:20,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd rather have space mining.

299
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:22,660
Speaker 1: I might have rockets on my tropical island.

300
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:23,584
Speaker 1: Oh, will you?

301
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:26,235
Speaker 1: they might land off the coast of my tropical island.

302
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:27,239
Speaker 1: I can go swim out and get them.

303
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,535
Speaker 1: That'd be fun.

304
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:34,131
Speaker 1: Imagine like you're watching a shuttle launch from your Florida Key Island And then the booster lands off the little shore.

305
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:35,015
Speaker 1: you row in your rowboat.

306
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:36,019
Speaker 1: go grab a piece.

307
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:37,345
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do with that?

308
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:40,198
Speaker 1: put in my little museum my tropical island?

309
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:52,906
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day I present to you a memoriam of one sea roach.

310
00:19:54,310 --> 00:20:00,590
Speaker 1: I Love I just love roaches in the bug or roach as in smoking some weed or roaches in a dude named roach.

311
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:07,949
Speaker 0: So this is this is in the same vein as the sort of infamous free cat meme but much more tasteful.

312
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:10,276
Speaker 0: and Also, I love this sort of thing.

313
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:14,690
Speaker 0: I just think it's clever and funny and I hope the people who walked by I got a little bit of a laugh.

314
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:21,521
Speaker 0: I think the moment that really makes it for me is when the guy pours out the coke like you would pour out like when The guy throws the flower a tiny flower.

315
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what do you got for me?

316
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:29,070
Speaker 1: So, you know one thing we always complain about is people one thing at panels not knowing how to ask a question.

317
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:33,110
Speaker 0: In fact, I believe we talked about how you should never let people ask questions at length.

318
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:38,310
Speaker 1: So here is a Chronicle calm which is the Chronicle of higher education.

319
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,643
Speaker 1: This guy wrote this article entitled how to ask a question by Peter wood.

320
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:45,797
Speaker 1: He posted it in March 30th 2012 So it's pretty recent.

321
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:48,456
Speaker 1: allow me to read to you Paragraph number one.

322
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,003
Speaker 1: last Wednesday.

323
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:56,770
Speaker 1: I attended a debate at st Francis College in Brooklyn at which three men engaged in a lively literate and deeply informed exchange.

324
00:20:57,552 --> 00:21:02,490
Speaker 1: After they finished and the moderator opened the floor for questions the usual thing happened.

325
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:06,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, the questioners by and large had no questions.

326
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:10,430
Speaker 1: instead They offered up prolix piles of words that led nowhere in particular.

327
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:14,160
Speaker 1: Some sought to show off what they mistook as their own superior knowledge.

328
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:15,624
Speaker 1: others scolded.

329
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:18,253
Speaker 1: a few got lost in their own Labyrinths.

330
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:24,540
Speaker 1: the closest we came to a question was the jacuzzi Rhetorical jab more or less in the form.

331
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,049
Speaker 1: Don't you agree that you're an ignorant buffoon?

332
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,674
Speaker 0: This guy's speaking my language.

333
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:33,066
Speaker 1: Yes, and he said basically says why has asking become so hard?

334
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,514
Speaker 1: and he wrote this great article That's pretty long ish.

335
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:42,218
Speaker 1: It's about regular length actually about how people don't know how to fucking ask a question at a panel Lecture, it's debate.

336
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:47,430
Speaker 0: It's a ye out there Whoever impinge upon us for telling you you should not accept questions.

337
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,735
Speaker 1: Behold well, this guy isn't.

338
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,116
Speaker 1: he's doing.

339
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:50,838
Speaker 1: he's not doing that.

340
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:54,470
Speaker 1: He's basically telling people how to ask a question properly.

341
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:58,450
Speaker 1: He's saying no, he's talking to the question askers not to the question takers.

342
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:06,850
Speaker 0: But I would I would posit that that will not have any effect for the people who tend to ask those questions Will not read no, but yeah.

343
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:13,629
Speaker 1: But basically he completely agrees with us and he is the right ideas Pretty much straight down the line about how to ask a good question, etc.

344
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,387
Speaker 0: It said you get one punctuation mark and it can't be a semi-colon.

345
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:19,560
Speaker 1: Yep And he also one is.

346
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:21,610
Speaker 1: one of the great things he points out is here.

347
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:28,837
Speaker 1: I'll read it if you are tempted to speak as the representative of some category Resist as a native of Pittsburgh.

348
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:35,114
Speaker 1: I find your categorization of the open-hearth Bessemer steel process historically uninformed and offensive Accomplishes nothing.

349
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:39,407
Speaker 1: were there any viable alternatives to the Bessemer steel process of the 1860s would suffice.

350
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:48,310
Speaker 1: Declarations that begin as a woman as an African American as a Christian all carry the same instant discount in the audience.

351
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:51,562
Speaker 1: They claim a privileged form of knowledge that no one need grant you.

352
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,896
Speaker 1: other people in the same category May have quite different views.

353
00:22:55,237 --> 00:22:58,110
Speaker 1: who appointed me to speak for Pittsburgh or you to speak for all women?

354
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:58,693
Speaker 0: What if?

355
00:22:58,874 --> 00:23:01,869
Speaker 0: what if the lecture were about me?

356
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:07,530
Speaker 0: And I said as me the person you were just speaking about is the one exception.

357
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:13,425
Speaker 1: But The whole article is basically full of paragraphs much like that one.

358
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:28,110
Speaker 0: so I'm tempted to to recall a moment long ago when we used to go to Otacon and We were at the con feedback and like eight people in a row stood up and said I've been coming to Otacon for eight years.

359
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:31,169
Speaker 0: I've been coming to Otacon for 12 years and everyone applaud each time.

360
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:36,950
Speaker 0: And our friend Pete was in line to ask a question and when he got up he said my name is Pete.

361
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:38,404
Speaker 0: I've been coming to Otacon for 400 years.

362
00:23:42,272 --> 00:23:46,209
Speaker 0: Few people in the audience laughed and most everyone else actually looked pretty pissed off.

363
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:48,742
Speaker 0: It was a proud moment.

364
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:49,669
Speaker 1: who's good times.

365
00:23:50,192 --> 00:24:00,275
Speaker 0: But speaking of conventions in the meta moment the mocha fest the museum of comic and cartoon air Which we've neglected to mention if you do not know has a fest Except for every year.

366
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,421
Speaker 1: when we mentioned it we attended every year.

367
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,407
Speaker 0: It is one of my favorite things.

368
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:09,268
Speaker 0: every year Saturday or Sunday Saturday, I think what time I don't know all day all day.

369
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,629
Speaker 1: But you thing is I always go as soon as it opens and then you don't get there into like one.

370
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:15,331
Speaker 0: That's cuz.

371
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:20,368
Speaker 0: I'm always laden back with a bunch of people and plans and I eat and I'm not gonna go to one.

372
00:24:21,153 --> 00:24:22,347
Speaker 0: Okay, I'll get there opening.

373
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,770
Speaker 0: Thing is this year I'm gonna a lot of video and do a nice montage video of the whole thing.

374
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,456
Speaker 1: Tell me when you're actually gonna be there.

375
00:24:29,556 --> 00:24:29,717
Speaker 1: cuz.

376
00:24:29,737 --> 00:24:33,330
Speaker 1: then that way like if you go with the opening then I get there at one.

377
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:34,288
Speaker 1: You'll be like at lunch.

378
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if I go there at the opening and you don't get there till later I'm gonna want to go anyway.

379
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:44,125
Speaker 0: You just showed up if you were anywhere near New York City and you like comics and/or cartoons.

380
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:45,390
Speaker 0: This is your jam.

381
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,061
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, this is great.

382
00:24:47,242 --> 00:24:49,978
Speaker 1: It's there's great stuff here And you only have to go for like you.

383
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:51,950
Speaker 1: only you don't to go for like the whole weekend three hours.

384
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,786
Speaker 1: You can walk around the whole place just show up walk around to every table and then leave.

385
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:57,793
Speaker 0: it's like $15.

386
00:24:57,793 --> 00:25:02,288
Speaker 1: there's some really good panels if you really want to go to them, but they have tiny rooms.

387
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:02,850
Speaker 0: It's not worth.

388
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,801
Speaker 0: I've never gone to one but there's pretty awesome people to give it him.

389
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:08,130
Speaker 0: Yes, but it is this weekend.

390
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:11,709
Speaker 0: Oh shit, Saturday, April 28th and Sunday, April 29th.

391
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:21,469
Speaker 0: So not too long after that July 13th through 15th is Connecticut that convention in Hartford that has everything from steampunk to anime to vidya games.

392
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:24,500
Speaker 0: soon Yep, we were on the panels department.

393
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,283
Speaker 1: What day is it again?

394
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:25,926
Speaker 0: Oh, July 30, July.

395
00:25:27,254 --> 00:25:28,323
Speaker 1: Okay, it's more time than I thought.

396
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:28,867
Speaker 1: I think he's at June.

397
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:34,350
Speaker 0: So I have started scheduling panels workshops and lectures.

398
00:25:34,894 --> 00:25:38,899
Speaker 0: So if you want to submit an event Go to the website and submit it soon.

399
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:44,502
Speaker 0: the longer you wait the shittier time slot You are likely to get and the web form is real shitty.

400
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,165
Speaker 1: We're sorry.

401
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:46,370
Speaker 0: It'll get better next year.

402
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's last year.

403
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:50,705
Speaker 0: It did get well it got worse, but that's cuz.

404
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:53,696
Speaker 0: we went to a new system Between last year and the year before.

405
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:55,482
Speaker 0: it got better and between the year before.

406
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:58,999
Speaker 0: in the year before that it got a hundred thousand Infinity percent better.

407
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:00,449
Speaker 1: I guess I just start working on the kid.

408
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:07,850
Speaker 0: I guess you should captain head of all operations and logistics for panels workshops and lectures and guests.

409
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:12,405
Speaker 1: Yeah, the main I mean if I can get the tripods and I can guarantee that table is gonna be there.

410
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:15,349
Speaker 1: pretty much everything else I can just do myself.

411
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:17,116
Speaker 1: That's pretty much all I got to do.

412
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:18,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, Connecticut is fun.

413
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:22,840
Speaker 0: If you're friends with Dave Riley of fast karate fame We've invited him to submit a panel.

414
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,309
Speaker 0: He said he might uh Tell him to submit it.

415
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:28,278
Speaker 0: I guarantee he will fill rooms.

416
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:31,089
Speaker 0: all of you fans of him tell him to come and I will hook him up.

417
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:33,197
Speaker 0: But he has to give me a submission.

418
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:35,968
Speaker 0: I'm not just gonna pay for him to come for nothing.

419
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:36,590
Speaker 1: That's right.

420
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,423
Speaker 1: What else I can zenka can?

421
00:26:40,443 --> 00:26:41,630
Speaker 1: when is it is soon?

422
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:47,796
Speaker 0: You hear that delay there.

423
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:48,138
Speaker 0: that's me.

424
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,425
Speaker 0: I have to look at my man.

425
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:53,085
Speaker 1: 11th and 12th Which I think is a Friday and a Saturday, but not a Sunday.

426
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:57,622
Speaker 1: That's us Greater Philadelphia Expo Center Oaks, Pennsylvania.

427
00:26:57,642 --> 00:26:59,530
Speaker 0: I think that's in or near King of Prussia.

428
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:04,108
Speaker 0: I forget Zenkai Khan is an anime con that is run by people we know.

429
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:09,150
Speaker 0: and Actually, the other Scott is the head of panels and workshops at that conventions got Johnson.

430
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,847
Speaker 0: Yes, the other Scott the one who likes politics not me.

431
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:15,462
Speaker 0: Yes There is a third Scott Johnson and a fourth and a fifth.

432
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:16,788
Speaker 1: There's a lot of Scott.

433
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:24,430
Speaker 0: Yes We will be a Zenkai Khan doing a po a pony a panel about both my little pony and dude bro in the same panel.

434
00:27:24,813 --> 00:27:36,530
Speaker 0: Okay, and I forget what else we're doing but we're doing a bunch of stuff and if you were there when we're not presenting we're either going to be eating ridiculous food or Playing German board games in the gaming area both.

435
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,710
Speaker 0: We actually ran into a lot of fans there last year.

436
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:46,850
Speaker 0: So feel free to bother us and say hi if you see us at the con It's one of the few cons where we're actually kind of just chilling with downtime.

437
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,122
Speaker 0: We're not like in a hurry to run off and do crazy programming.

438
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:50,764
Speaker 0: I don't know.

439
00:27:50,844 --> 00:27:52,490
Speaker 1: Are we actually gonna go on the Friday though?

440
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,155
Speaker 1: I think we'll just go.

441
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:54,910
Speaker 0: just I think we'll just be there all day Saturday.

442
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:58,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, you know the dead thing is a day after is Mother's Day.

443
00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:00,798
Speaker 0: Yeah Well the day after it I got a fly to Istanbul.

444
00:28:00,858 --> 00:28:05,650
Speaker 1: so my mom was like, hey, we're barbecue something I'm like coming in from Pennsylvania.

445
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,360
Speaker 0: You could fly to Connecticut.

446
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, where am I gonna fly to?

447
00:28:09,746 --> 00:28:10,288
Speaker 0: I don't know.

448
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:13,379
Speaker 0: There's got to be an airport somewhere near Bridgeport.

449
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,690
Speaker 0: No, no, no, how about near New Haven?

450
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,262
Speaker 0: Nope, I'm pretty sure there's an airport near New Haven.

451
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:20,503
Speaker 1: Yes.

452
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:23,275
Speaker 1: It's a tiny kind of Airport where you know They get a little tiny Cessna.

453
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:26,350
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can get a shitty little tiny Cessna from Philly.

454
00:28:26,531 --> 00:28:27,696
Speaker 1: That's just what I want to do.

455
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:28,801
Speaker 1: It's worth it.

456
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:30,528
Speaker 1: No, why not?

457
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,669
Speaker 1: No Renting a car is a better idea.

458
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:38,043
Speaker 0: Anyway, and I guess after all that is Otakon We did submit panels as we do every year.

459
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:41,657
Speaker 0: if they accept our panels They accepted our panels every time.

460
00:28:41,797 --> 00:28:48,197
Speaker 0: every panel we'd ever submitted every year since 2002 were accepted until they decided they hated us And kicked us off the staff.

461
00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:48,720
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

462
00:28:49,243 --> 00:28:50,330
Speaker 1: if they accept the panels we'll go.

463
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:57,385
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if they kicked us off the staff because we resigned and they didn't respond and then like Months later, they cut off my access to the staff site.

464
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:58,269
Speaker 0: So I don't know.

465
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:00,438
Speaker 0: No one ever like emailed us.

466
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:00,920
Speaker 0: They didn't.

467
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,370
Speaker 1: they did not communicate very well, which is the problem.

468
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,049
Speaker 0: So I guess I don't know but we submitted yet again.

469
00:29:06,592 --> 00:29:10,870
Speaker 0: So I'll just say that if you want us to attend Otakon we did submit a bunch of panels.

470
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:13,379
Speaker 0: You should tell Otakon you want us to be there.

471
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,364
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll be there.

472
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:19,260
Speaker 0: if they give us panels we'll show up and Pax dev slash.

473
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,350
Speaker 0: Pax prime is also coming.

474
00:29:20,531 --> 00:29:25,247
Speaker 1: We will be at pax day weekend for sure same weekend as dragon con which we won't be going to.

475
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:27,460
Speaker 0: sorry dragon con If you move we'd go.

476
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:28,166
Speaker 0: that's right.

477
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:35,476
Speaker 1: It's like Dragon con is sort of like swords And I'm pretty.

478
00:29:35,496 --> 00:29:37,062
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna go to Pax dev.

479
00:29:37,103 --> 00:29:38,629
Speaker 0: so if any of you were going to Pax dev let me know.

480
00:29:39,394 --> 00:29:39,676
Speaker 1: Maybe.

481
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:41,529
Speaker 0: well, I think I'm gonna go anyway.

482
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:43,898
Speaker 0: Maybe do a lecture.

483
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:44,260
Speaker 0: We'll see.

484
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:46,370
Speaker 0: That's all up in the air still.

485
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:51,183
Speaker 0: So I guess Scott can introduce this since it was his idea for a show.

486
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:52,989
Speaker 1: I actually should probably bring it up.

487
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:56,057
Speaker 1: Is the story right?

488
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:57,142
Speaker 1: so Twitter bootstrap?

489
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:02,509
Speaker 1: if you don't know Twitter bootstrap, this is pretty awesome JavaScript framework library sort of thing.

490
00:30:02,715 --> 00:30:03,008
Speaker 1: All right.

491
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:12,056
Speaker 1: and basically what it does is if you see a website mate once you go to the Twitter bootstrap website and if you go to Twitter the actual Twitter website and You see what they look like.

492
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:20,209
Speaker 1: you'll know if you when a website is made with Twitter bootstrap It's like you can just tell that's a bootstrap website just by looking at it, right?

493
00:30:20,931 --> 00:30:39,155
Speaker 1: And it basically allows people who don't have a lot of front-end web developments HTML CSS skills But in jazz skills but still have enough skills To make a pretty good looking website with good fonts and colors and buttons and all the and pop-ups and menus and navigation Without.

494
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:45,635
Speaker 1: you know that don't look like complete shit without a lot of skills, so it's a good thing and There's a lot of JavaScript in it.

495
00:30:45,715 --> 00:30:47,403
Speaker 1: So there was an issue right?

496
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:48,929
Speaker 1: Let me explain the issue in detail.

497
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:53,261
Speaker 1: So in JavaScript semi-colons are optional.

498
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:53,802
Speaker 1: right.

499
00:30:54,164 --> 00:31:01,630
Speaker 1: the JavaScript, you know Parsers and compilers that are in the browsers can sort of figure out where the end of a statement is.

500
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:04,370
Speaker 1: So if you have a semicolon, they know that a statement is ended.

501
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,847
Speaker 1: But if you don't have one they can sort of tell and it doesn't matter.

502
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:08,188
Speaker 1: you can.

503
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:09,970
Speaker 0: you know It's optional kind of like in bash.

504
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,794
Speaker 0: You don't have to stick them in the ends of your statements But I should.

505
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:17,357
Speaker 1: well you can if you want to put multiple statements in the same line But you probably shouldn't same thing in JavaScript, right?

506
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:20,007
Speaker 1: You can use a semicolon to put in the same line, but whatever.

507
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:26,187
Speaker 1: so The bootstrap people they sort of don't like the semicolon like they're anti semicolon.

508
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:32,126
Speaker 1: They're like, hey We let's just do it one way consistently through the whole probe through the whole, you know file all our code.

509
00:31:32,668 --> 00:31:33,450
Speaker 1: No semicolons.

510
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:41,599
Speaker 1: So there was a particular line in one of their you know code things that did not have a semicolon Because they didn't have a semicolon.

511
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:43,770
Speaker 1: right their code did work.

512
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:50,430
Speaker 1: But if you minified the JavaScript using JS min a very popular JavaScript minifier.

513
00:31:51,571 --> 00:32:02,047
Speaker 1: Now JavaScript minification if you don't know is when you squish the JavaScript real small like so that it takes up less space So it downloads faster so your web page loads faster, but which actually can add up it can it's.

514
00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:02,710
Speaker 1: it's very important.

515
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,918
Speaker 1: It's something you should definitely do.

516
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:14,226
Speaker 1: So for example, I write some JavaScript I have real variable names like, you know, you know size of button But then it would be get changed to like s you know in that way.

517
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:18,190
Speaker 0: It's shorter when the code Yeah, it makes it as small as it can be and still do the same thing, right?

518
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:27,390
Speaker 1: So when you JS min when it minified this code Right because there was no semicolon the code actually broke when it was minified.

519
00:32:27,992 --> 00:32:38,768
Speaker 1: So a huge internet debate broke out on github because somebody submitted a thing that said Issue need semicolon and the guy was like here you want it.

520
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:39,189
Speaker 0: I'll read it.

521
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:42,339
Speaker 0: Fat the guy who would close the issue.

522
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:43,302
Speaker 1: That's the bootstrap guy.

523
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:43,563
Speaker 0: Yep.

524
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:44,285
Speaker 0: Nope.

525
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:45,650
Speaker 0: That's a bug in JS min.

526
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:48,358
Speaker 0: You probably should let Douglas Crockford know about it though.

527
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:48,719
Speaker 0: Thanks.

528
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:52,330
Speaker 1: Douglas Crockford is the JS min guy and fat is the bootstrap guy.

529
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:56,890
Speaker 0: Yep, so he basically said he basically said the developer equivalent of yeah, fuck you.

530
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:02,310
Speaker 1: So Douglas Crockford the JS min guy said that is insanely stupid code.

531
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:05,090
Speaker 1: I am NOT going to dumb down JS min for this case.

532
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:11,510
Speaker 1: And he also said TC 39 is considering the use of bang which is exclamation point as an infix operator.

533
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:13,239
Speaker 1: The code will break in the future.

534
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:13,902
Speaker 1: fix it now.

535
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,390
Speaker 1: learn to use semicolons properly.

536
00:33:15,851 --> 00:33:18,880
Speaker 1: Bang is not to be intended to be a statement separator.

537
00:33:18,961 --> 00:33:19,703
Speaker 1: semicolon is.

538
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:24,458
Speaker 1: so basically what happened here is The code broke when it was JS minned.

539
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,890
Speaker 1: the other guy said that's JS min's fault.

540
00:33:27,991 --> 00:33:29,369
Speaker 1: My code is valid code.

541
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,918
Speaker 1: JS min shouldn't break the code when it means it.

542
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:35,550
Speaker 1: the jazz min guy said your code is valid code.

543
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:47,469
Speaker 1: But jazz men, you know, you write stupid code without semicolons, you know, Jay I'm not gonna put a thing in JS min to handle your stupid code when all you could do is type one character the semicolon and it would work.

544
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:56,292
Speaker 1: and Also in the next version right in TC 39. right your code won't even work anymore Right.

545
00:33:56,352 --> 00:33:57,858
Speaker 1: It's only only now your code works.

546
00:33:57,898 --> 00:33:59,082
Speaker 1: It's not gonna work in the future.

547
00:33:59,123 --> 00:34:01,110
Speaker 1: It's not forwards, you know compatible.

548
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:05,063
Speaker 1: So and you know jazz min is forwards compatible.

549
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:09,676
Speaker 0: screw you now 240 something comments later.

550
00:34:09,696 --> 00:34:14,050
Speaker 0: a lot of comments is this gets huge internet war.

551
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:20,902
Speaker 0: I think every kind of IT and CS guy made at least one comment from you.

552
00:34:20,922 --> 00:34:21,605
Speaker 0: guys are stupid.

553
00:34:21,665 --> 00:34:23,230
Speaker 0: picture of a lolcat to.

554
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:27,625
Speaker 0: You know every possible, you know, the new type people were posting in here.

555
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:29,089
Speaker 0: Scott posted something.

556
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,196
Speaker 0: Did you find my post?

557
00:34:31,357 --> 00:34:32,402
Speaker 0: I found your post.

558
00:34:32,482 --> 00:34:32,744
Speaker 1: Oh here.

559
00:34:32,764 --> 00:34:33,708
Speaker 1: Let me read my post.

560
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,116
Speaker 1: Reason to use semicolons.

561
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,862
Speaker 1: code will work properly and people will be able to get work done.

562
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:40,889
Speaker 1: reason not to use semicolons.

563
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,474
Speaker 1: Aesthetics and ego.

564
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:44,159
Speaker 1: are you adults or children?

565
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,686
Speaker 0: question mark don't be a JavaScript hipster.

566
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:49,909
Speaker 0: use semicolons That's right, or I think my favorite one.

567
00:34:50,231 --> 00:34:51,614
Speaker 0: Oh for fuck's sake people.

568
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:58,544
Speaker 0: if using ugly semicolons and a few actual parentheses will guarantee current and future compatibility Then what is the problem?

569
00:34:58,705 --> 00:34:59,270
Speaker 0: That's right.

570
00:35:00,192 --> 00:35:10,701
Speaker 0: So this is an age-old argument that anyone who's dealt with software developers or open source projects or GNU Linux people There's two camps on every is not something that is new.

571
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:13,210
Speaker 1: this is an age-old thing that has many incarnations.

572
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,913
Speaker 0: This is just a simple example of.

573
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:26,508
Speaker 0: is it just one example that is recent and big camp number one Technically correct and or right and I say right in quotes because they have some sort of Ideological reason to be right.

574
00:35:26,528 --> 00:35:30,061
Speaker 1: Yes Someone has some sort of principle that they you know stand by like.

575
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:41,521
Speaker 1: this is my coding principle and I will follow it Even though if it isn't, you know, technically necessary to follow like for example, ah Someone might say you should never use ternary operators.

576
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:44,470
Speaker 0: I will never use them in my code and my code era.

577
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,874
Speaker 0: I have a thing even though they work.

578
00:35:46,155 --> 00:35:47,058
Speaker 1: Yep, and they're a thing.

579
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,542
Speaker 0: I will never support them.

580
00:35:48,743 --> 00:35:53,444
Speaker 0: my thing whatever it is compiling code Maybe I wrote a custom compiler will break if you use them.

581
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,470
Speaker 0: So fuck you, right?

582
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,754
Speaker 1: But yet there is they.

583
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:57,018
Speaker 1: someone finds an example.

584
00:35:57,098 --> 00:36:16,630
Speaker 1: Hey, if you use a ternary operator here, you know obviously this example would never be true, but If you think it's really actually answer yet No, there's a there's a you know, there's a performance bonus to using the ternary operator here instead of a. you know An if statement which is never gonna be true because the compiler is smart enough to tell the same difference.

585
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,926
Speaker 0: Well, maybe the thing that guy wrote is a shitty compiler.

586
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:19,409
Speaker 0: Who knows?

587
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:23,450
Speaker 1: You know, it's like come on dude, right?

588
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:29,130
Speaker 0: But then the other camp is do stuff that works for the most people in the simplest way possible.

589
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,832
Speaker 0: Yeah You know what.

590
00:36:32,394 --> 00:36:36,306
Speaker 0: the people on the back on the right side the second half they're pretty much right.

591
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:37,630
Speaker 0: that wins in the end.

592
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:39,710
Speaker 1: I mean the thing is this is open source, right?

593
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:44,610
Speaker 1: So you could just fork this and put your semicolons in which people did but that's that's the stack.

594
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,881
Speaker 1: But that's annoying because shit fracture.

595
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:50,900
Speaker 1: because now I can't just you know Keep installing the latest version of bootstrap.

596
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:57,506
Speaker 1: now every time I install or upgrade bootstrap I have to remember to go put the semicolon back and then minify it and it just creates all this work.

597
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,330
Speaker 1: or I have to Follow this other version of bootstrap.

598
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:08,280
Speaker 1: but what if that guy doesn't update quickly enough and you just make a whole bunch of work for a whole bunch of people just Because you won't push one button on your keyboard to type a semicolon.

599
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:20,609
Speaker 0: Yep principles in technology real technology You know stuff that you actually want people to use and actually do use Has to work before it's good as opposed to being good before it works.

600
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:23,970
Speaker 1: That's right You know, I mean I'm not saying principles are not completely worthless, right?

601
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,748
Speaker 1: You know, there are many principles where it's like, you know, you should you should do this.

602
00:37:29,172 --> 00:37:30,818
Speaker 1: It's a should versus a must.

603
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:41,375
Speaker 1: the only must is your shit must always work Right, if it doesn't work if there is an instance no matter what instance where there is brokenness Then you need to fix that.

604
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:44,305
Speaker 1: Here's an if that fixing goes against some principle.

605
00:37:44,626 --> 00:38:00,270
Speaker 0: if you do something that is technically a hundred percent correct with say some version of HTML and it turns out that most browsers do it wrong and There is a technically incorrect way that every browser supports you should be using the technically incorrect way, that's right.

606
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:05,670
Speaker 0: I'm at you know, my job is basically to manage software now and actually I've run into this.

607
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:09,230
Speaker 1: I have built this engine in this car according to these principles.

608
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:16,050
Speaker 1: The car doesn't start of course not because of this bullshit, but I've done it the right way and I won't change it.

609
00:38:16,431 --> 00:38:18,060
Speaker 1: Well, your car is never gonna go anywhere.

610
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at least my car is right.

611
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:22,270
Speaker 1: All your driving cars are wrong.

612
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:28,410
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make it to contentious point that a lot of open source Equivalence of things and open source projects go nowhere because of this sort of bullshit.

613
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:36,493
Speaker 0: Yes, because if I'd like a lot of libraries for like Python have this problem, like I'll find some Python library I'm like, oh I'll use this.

614
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:44,985
Speaker 0: it looks great and it has some like stupid principled bullshit where I have to do all this Wrapper code around it to make it work because it doesn't play nice with anything else.

615
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,795
Speaker 0: I just give up I don't even bother.

616
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:48,385
Speaker 1: and it's not just.

617
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:50,655
Speaker 1: you know Computers you see this problem.

618
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:55,170
Speaker 1: You see this in all sorts of professions, you know various engineering things, right?

619
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:04,475
Speaker 1: You know, it's like no the plumber insists on using this particular thing, you know, every time things not available For a month.

620
00:39:04,535 --> 00:39:13,820
Speaker 1: Yeah using some particular method of screwing or piping or who knows what because that's a much, you know Superior method to whatever it is these engineering.

621
00:39:14,181 --> 00:39:17,270
Speaker 1: so he follows that method but it doesn't actually work as well.

622
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,638
Speaker 0: now No, we're talking about principles as an abstract sense.

623
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:29,130
Speaker 0: if you take a principled stand on a functional issue For example, if you build the building that way it'll fall down if there's an earthquake.

624
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:31,075
Speaker 1: Yeah That's not what I mean by a principle.

625
00:39:31,095 --> 00:39:34,206
Speaker 0: that's a functional stand as well as a principled stand.

626
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:38,760
Speaker 1: a principle is like You know just some sort of like ideal thing that you follow.

627
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:45,630
Speaker 1: that is like, you know your way for example Let me try to think of some sort of principle.

628
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:47,373
Speaker 1: Well, you know.

629
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:48,618
Speaker 0: just a code example right?

630
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:51,989
Speaker 1: no exactly, you know, no semi-colons for something else.

631
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:53,143
Speaker 1: Well, you know.

632
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:54,774
Speaker 1: Here's an example.

633
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:56,600
Speaker 1: Someone has a particular way.

634
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:59,450
Speaker 1: They like to hold the joystick in Street Fighter, right?

635
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,089
Speaker 1: You got to put your hands just like this and they you know, that's the right way to do it.

636
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:07,090
Speaker 1: Some guy comes around he's holds the joystick in a different way, you know.

637
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,461
Speaker 1: Maybe he's got his hand backwards or who knows what the hell.

638
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:11,973
Speaker 1: maybe he's holding it from the top instead of from the side Or whatever.

639
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:18,824
Speaker 1: the other guys like you're holding the joystick the wrong way But meanwhile the dude kicks your ass perfect two out of three rounds.

640
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:20,010
Speaker 1: You don't even get to punch him once.

641
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:21,716
Speaker 1: Does guess what?

642
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,170
Speaker 1: winning matters more than how he holds a joystick, right?

643
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:28,162
Speaker 1: You have your you know, you you think that that's the proper technique for holding a joystick.

644
00:40:28,202 --> 00:40:32,912
Speaker 1: Well, the other guy beat you so Tough shit.

645
00:40:33,273 --> 00:40:34,477
Speaker 1: Yep, you know in golf.

646
00:40:34,497 --> 00:40:47,084
Speaker 1: There's a lot of debates over like using the belly putter which you know is a Legal thing to use even though they might change that rule, but right now it is a legal thing Even though other people, you know, like Tiger Woods like says odds bullshit.

647
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,489
Speaker 1: You shouldn't be able to do that, but they can.

648
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:51,535
Speaker 1: It's like Tiger Woods is a principal.

649
00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:52,638
Speaker 1: belly putters are bullshit.

650
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,964
Speaker 1: guy with the belly butter beat you.

651
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:57,250
Speaker 1: it's legal tough shit.

652
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:57,912
Speaker 1: Snaking

653
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:58,655
Speaker 0: you're making

654
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,526
Speaker 1: exactly right same thing, but

655
00:41:01,747 --> 00:41:19,962
Speaker 0: especially here You it seems like ideals in the in the open source technology world specifically get in the way of progress more so than they need to And it's always the exact same kind of crap like this discussion happens Everywhere every day every big product.

656
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:21,007
Speaker 0: It's all over the place.

657
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:23,334
Speaker 0: It's endemic and It happens.

658
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:23,997
Speaker 1: You know what happens.

659
00:41:24,037 --> 00:41:26,570
Speaker 1: a lot happens a lot in like open source gooey design, right?

660
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,239
Speaker 1: Where you know the like the gnome three people are like.

661
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,109
Speaker 1: these are the principles by which we will you know?

662
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,870
Speaker 1: Design our new gooey for gnome three, but then you know a designer like me.

663
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,330
Speaker 0: They follow they if you put a button here, even though that's not your button standard.

664
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:42,062
Speaker 0: It's way more intuitive.

665
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,069
Speaker 0: They'll be like nope can't do it.

666
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:43,972
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like.

667
00:41:44,012 --> 00:41:50,519
Speaker 1: these are the rules that we put down and we're gonna follow those rules to the T in every Single window and every dialogue and everything.

668
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:52,666
Speaker 1: There's only everyone's like gnome three sucks.

669
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:53,550
Speaker 1: We want gnome two bag.

670
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,696
Speaker 0: I you know I designed a. I'm really big on Semantic consistency like this.

671
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:06,037
Speaker 0: the semantics of an interface or of a software design have to be consistent Like the same language is used every.

672
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:11,358
Speaker 0: you can't call something an alert in one place and an event somewhere else If they're actually the same thing, that's right.

673
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:13,507
Speaker 0: You can't switch your verbs, you know that kind of stuff.

674
00:42:13,527 --> 00:42:13,768
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

675
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:18,830
Speaker 0: And at the same time a. some of the software I manage has legacy code.

676
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:24,266
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna hold up a production release because some legacy code doesn't fit the new semantics.

677
00:42:24,888 --> 00:42:26,350
Speaker 0: if it's functional That's right.

678
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:27,950
Speaker 0: I'll open a ticket to fix it later.

679
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,703
Speaker 0: But I'm not gonna hold it up for my bullshit principles because the users never gonna see that.

680
00:42:31,743 --> 00:42:34,400
Speaker 0: that's like I'm wanting people to change Class names.

681
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:39,953
Speaker 0: Yep it's the same thing and I don't know what else we can say on this really other than the People.

682
00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:46,327
Speaker 0: whenever you see an argument like this Figure out who's taking the principal non-functional stand and make fun of them.

683
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:48,239
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm That's really all you can do.

684
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,610
Speaker 1: and or beat them.

685
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:56,052
Speaker 1: And also if you you know, you catch yourself right being the guy who's making the stupid stand like, you know It's broken.

686
00:42:56,113 --> 00:43:02,424
Speaker 1: and if you're the guy who says don't fix it then you're wrong because the answer is always fix it All right, we don't care, right?

687
00:43:03,754 --> 00:43:05,040
Speaker 1: Just fix it make it work.

688
00:43:05,402 --> 00:43:14,650
Speaker 1: working is the most important thing Even if it you know The ugly working is better than the pretty broken because pretty broken may as well not even exist because it's broken.

689
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:19,001
Speaker 1: Look I made the most beautiful screwdriver in the world.

690
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:20,165
Speaker 1: Does it screw screws?

691
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:21,450
Speaker 1: No, but doesn't it look great?

692
00:43:21,972 --> 00:43:22,454
Speaker 1: Oh, what's that?

693
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,077
Speaker 1: You got there?

694
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:24,464
Speaker 1: It looks like a rusty stick.

695
00:43:24,544 --> 00:43:25,690
Speaker 1: it is but watch it screw.

696
00:43:32,082 --> 00:43:34,600
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

697
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,399
