1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,347
Speaker 1: It's Monday July 17th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:15,415
Speaker 1: tonight We move towards science fiction.

3
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:23,536
Speaker 1: for a bit when Scott talks about the first of the lens man boats while I talk a bit about the difference engine Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:31,827
Speaker 1: if you notice a strange noise in the background today It's because we've left the air conditioning on due to the fact that despite the Sun having gone down.

5
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:36,635
Speaker 1: It is still a 100 billion degree night Warm today.

6
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:39,907
Speaker 0: warm yesterday even warmer today.

7
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:49,128
Speaker 1: Yeah In fact, it's so hot that I was at work today And I was listening to a bunch of podcasts which I'll get to because I got a lot to say about the pot.

8
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:50,917
Speaker 0: oh sphere Oh great.

9
00:00:51,239 --> 00:01:04,635
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a little manifesto here But I was at work, and I'm listening to my iPod and I'm typing and I'm drinking something and suddenly my computer turns off and I think Is my computer broken?

10
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:10,309
Speaker 1: did the power go out, but my brain says you're hearing music the power is not out.

11
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:13,589
Speaker 0: Were you listening to on your iPod or your computer iPod?

12
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,914
Speaker 1: Now of course.

13
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:23,409
Speaker 1: then I look to my left and my telephone Which is super digital is still on and working, but is it a vo IP or no?

14
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:23,570
Speaker 1: no?

15
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,199
Speaker 0: But it's just an internal digital phone network.

16
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, like log lines out.

17
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,342
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like yeah Voice over IP.

18
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:31,210
Speaker 0: yeah, I know what you're doing.

19
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:35,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, so then I look back and I look up and I realized hey all the lights went out.

20
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,571
Speaker 1: And yeah, the power was out woot Blackout.

21
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,141
Speaker 0: yeah, it was actually one of the sticks at my work when I was there.

22
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:45,150
Speaker 0: is they'd be like he's gonna black out black out.

23
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,676
Speaker 0: They had a joke about blackouts.

24
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:49,863
Speaker 1: the funniest thing was it went out.

25
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:50,725
Speaker 1: and what I realized?

26
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:52,150
Speaker 1: the power is out almost immediately.

27
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,803
Speaker 1: Someone like two cubes over goes son of uh.

28
00:01:56,204 --> 00:01:57,790
Speaker 1: and then someone else like save his work.

29
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,155
Speaker 1: And then someone else says fuck it.

30
00:01:59,175 --> 00:01:59,677
Speaker 1: I'm going home.

31
00:01:59,697 --> 00:02:01,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, good thing.

32
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:03,210
Speaker 0: We bought UPS is just the other day.

33
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:05,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, now we're gonna go buy some more.

34
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna buy like four UPS's and stick them on everything.

35
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:13,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's cool because then they'll be less excuse to not do geek nights.

36
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:19,064
Speaker 0: Yep, because we at the at the worst if we can keep the networking equipment on.

37
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:21,756
Speaker 0: no if we get we'll just turn the networking equipment off.

38
00:02:22,302 --> 00:02:28,329
Speaker 0: well To record the podcast on my laptop, hopefully the battery on it won't die.

39
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:37,550
Speaker 0: and Then we'll plug the networking equipment in power it up on the battery Connect with the wireless or wire with the laptop.

40
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:46,399
Speaker 1: Yeah Upload it and then turn everything back off when because five minute you it would have to be one fuck of a power outage For us to not be able to use our cable modem.

41
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:51,483
Speaker 0: It really would yeah, especially, you know I mean for the cable company would have to die when.

42
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,597
Speaker 1: yeah, the thing is it was weird It was a power distribution problem.

43
00:02:54,617 --> 00:03:02,730
Speaker 1: because for all of you who don't live in downstate, New York like we do We're on the edge of remember in California had those rolling blackouts and all those problems.

44
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,717
Speaker 1: New York State is getting real close to that.

45
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:09,790
Speaker 0: like maybe we should build a power plant.

46
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:15,006
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but instead we have people protesting the power plant we have right here.

47
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:15,648
Speaker 0: But wait.

48
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:16,190
Speaker 0: All right.

49
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,165
Speaker 0: So what if we gave them what they wanted and we got rid of that power plant?

50
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:20,230
Speaker 0: What would we'd have?

51
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,199
Speaker 1: Well, we'd have fucking chaos.

52
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:24,348
Speaker 1: that's what we'd have because the power would stop.

53
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:27,555
Speaker 0: Oh Geniuses those people are.

54
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:32,830
Speaker 1: yeah, but seriously downstate New York is pretty much at capacity for electricity.

55
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:42,381
Speaker 1: So power outages are becoming more and more common and there if anything happens to any of the power plants around here Geek nights might be in trouble for a week or two.

56
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:50,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean think about it man Just a few rods of some metal in a big box basic a big cement box.

57
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:52,909
Speaker 0: With me up the power is now perfect.

58
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:58,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, all we need is a freaking metal in a box and we're fine with some water flowing it through it.

59
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:07,937
Speaker 1: All right anyway, now the reason I was listening to music is because well, I was listening to my iPod at least because I finally Decided to listen to a bunch of podcasts.

60
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:15,743
Speaker 0: now that we have the Mac all set up finally and rim finally learned the lessons that I learned when the iPod nano came out and I first discovered podcast.

61
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:25,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I found like 20 podcasts that looked good and I subscribed to all of them and I looked good Based on their text describe.

62
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:26,760
Speaker 0: They didn't sound good.

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,182
Speaker 0: I bet.

64
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:32,409
Speaker 1: now one thing is I found that all the educational ones I subscribed to so far are really good.

65
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:45,050
Speaker 1: In fact, I want to plug the 12 Byzantine Empire or Emperor's podcast Which is just discussions of 12 different emperors of the Byzantine aka the Eastern Roman Empire.

66
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,850
Speaker 1: All right, it's so far fascinating.

67
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:55,230
Speaker 1: however All the other podcasts I subscribe to were varying levels of ass.

68
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:56,915
Speaker 0: How much is?

69
00:04:57,216 --> 00:05:06,077
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna name names because a couple of them I listen to or kind of big names but I subscribe to a bunch of anime and Video game podcast.

70
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:17,010
Speaker 1: the video game ones were all unmitigated Asshole, they were just quiet nerdy nerds Barely talking about video games that they don't even know much about.

71
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:21,326
Speaker 1: Like one guy was talking about Grand Theft Auto and he didn't even know who made it.

72
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:26,410
Speaker 1: Maybe like he was mentioning like publishers of games.

73
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:31,190
Speaker 1: But then he'd like he said the wrong publisher and he didn't know who made Grand Theft Auto.

74
00:05:31,552 --> 00:05:37,396
Speaker 0: It's developed by rockstar, but it's published by take to interactive Yeah, and it was just kind of.

75
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:41,708
Speaker 0: I know that and I haven't played Grand Theft Auto since Grand Theft Auto one.

76
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:49,270
Speaker 1: Well, London expansion pack, but even so listening to these podcasts was like watching the first 15 minutes of Napoleon Dynamite.

77
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:50,469
Speaker 1: It's just painful

78
00:05:51,431 --> 00:06:11,966
Speaker 0: Yeah as basically the thing I got from podcasts I mean, you know, I felt bad because you know podcasting feels like blogging like it's this big amateur medium full of all sorts of interesting non-professional Big media people making good stuff, but in the end after you know, most amateur shit 99% of it is ass.

79
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:15,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, well webcomics are the same way.

80
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,570
Speaker 1: I mean, there's the big names and then there's all the good comics and then for every good comic there are a hundred bad ones.

81
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:32,665
Speaker 0: Let's see how many podcasts do I actually still subscribe to one two, three, four five six seven eight nine Ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen and one of those is like a temporary.

82
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:33,487
Speaker 0: I'm checking it out.

83
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:37,258
Speaker 1: So fourteen Two of the ones I subscribe to have already pod faded.

84
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:48,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's see how many of these are professional one two three four five six four five Six.

85
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:51,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure everyone wants to hear you counting.

86
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:55,930
Speaker 0: Okay, so half the podcasts I listen to are not amateur and half of them are yep.

87
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:58,518
Speaker 1: Now the anime ones didn't fare much better so far.

88
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:03,895
Speaker 1: The only anime related podcast I can at all stand to listen to are Geek nights.

89
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:11,361
Speaker 1: Oh, I do listen to a portion of every episode now just to make sure that every audio is okay and everything's going fine.

90
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:11,482
Speaker 1: and

91
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:15,629
Speaker 0: I listen to a few episodes and They kind of entertain me even though I know

92
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:23,417
Speaker 1: Surprisingly when I listen it actually is kind of cool because one I'll forget things that I said or Scott said a bunch of stuff that that

93
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:28,498
Speaker 0: would be the best if I could somehow forget geek nights Yeah, anything I said and then listen to all of it

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,610
Speaker 1: or like Scott will say stuff to me during on the show.

95
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,670
Speaker 1: But I'm not actually listening because I'm busy like writing or getting ready for the next bit or something.

96
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:37,594
Speaker 1: And then I listen.

97
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:39,242
Speaker 1: it was like, oh Scott says something really cool.

98
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:40,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, I say things all the time.

99
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,425
Speaker 1: Yes, don't pay attention as most of them are kind of man.

100
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:45,212
Speaker 0: He's a Mr.

101
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:45,613
Speaker 0: May.

102
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:49,185
Speaker 1: but then anime world order which is the only other anime podcast.

103
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:50,168
Speaker 1: I found that doesn't suck.

104
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:50,530
Speaker 1: so far.

105
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:58,189
Speaker 0: I have one video anime podcast besides anime world order that I subscribe to which is anime podcast net aka.

106
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:02,947
Speaker 0: Hey Yeah, that's that's as close as I can get to pronouncing it.

107
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:06,484
Speaker 1: I don't know I can't deal with video podcast because I don't have time to sit and watch.

108
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:09,037
Speaker 0: that's the thing is the video podcast I do are all short.

109
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:11,010
Speaker 0: It's got to be like less than five minutes.

110
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:20,369
Speaker 0: So it's the equivalent to watching something on YouTube, you know, yeah It's like it's basically someone who I know is gonna keep posting the same kind of thing and it's gonna be short.

111
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,744
Speaker 0: if it's like An actual show forget it.

112
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:31,591
Speaker 1: It's too much Yeah, but anyway to move on a bit because we're trying to rein in the episode length back to what it originally was Yeah Cuz.

113
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:42,950
Speaker 0: we've been getting episodes out of like an hour and a half a little over an hour and we really need to bring it Back to 45 minutes because we have the maximum libsyn account and we got dangerously close to filling it.

114
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:53,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, also the fact that I think if we go long just out of course We'll end up doing kind of a haphazard treatment of topics that would better be served by doing multiple episodes.

115
00:08:54,111 --> 00:09:00,795
Speaker 0: Yes, and also, you know, we have you know, there's a bin of stuff to talk about and a bin of stuff That's talked about.

116
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:03,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, we talk every weeknight.

117
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:07,290
Speaker 0: So if we have the bin that's you know, one item in the bin is pretty big.

118
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:13,030
Speaker 0: It's better to chop it up and use it for two weeks instead of just making one big long episode one week.

119
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:13,510
Speaker 1: Yeah

120
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,799
Speaker 0: Cuz that way the bin doesn't run out as quickly because

121
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:32,450
Speaker 1: it hit us once way back when we were reviewing anime for a while you know before con season and then we reviewed like two or three shows in an episode and then we Ran out of new shows to talk about Because we didn't space it out and we probably could have covered all those shows in better depth by breaking it up more.

122
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,149
Speaker 0: Yep, so that's what we're gonna do whether you like it or not.

123
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:40,997
Speaker 1: also, we're really gonna try to cut back on the news section because Geek nights is basically turned into.

124
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:44,890
Speaker 1: the first half is just twit with rim and Scott and then the second half is the show.

125
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:55,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, so with the new edition of the geek back segment, which is gonna come in like 10 seconds We are going to just reduce to one news and two things the day six five.

126
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:56,990
Speaker 1: Well, I guess we're doing it early then.

127
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:57,736
Speaker 0: Yes, we are.

128
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:59,410
Speaker 0: All right geek back ahead of schedule.

129
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:07,152
Speaker 0: The geek back for today is from Robert who is the awesome guy in the army and he says hello again random rim And Scott.

130
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:11,910
Speaker 0: to begin I would like to say I'm still loving your shows, but I still wish you talked more about comics.

131
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:19,530
Speaker 0: Well, I guess that's a good thing because you know I always seem to think that people might be like listening to our show and then getting tired of it and stop listening.

132
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,756
Speaker 0: But if he's still loving our shows, that's cool.

133
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,644
Speaker 1: Also this Thursday, we're going to talk about a comic.

134
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:25,707
Speaker 0: Yeah Wednesday.

135
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:34,397
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Wednesday Yeah, I always it's because anime Club was on Thursday back at I know I know but Wednesday night Wednesday episode we can.

136
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:36,490
Speaker 0: I see we're going to talk about a comic we already recorded.

137
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,377
Speaker 0: Now y'all where now?

138
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:44,790
Speaker 0: y'all were talking on Monday night's episode about Firefox works and all the websites.

139
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,215
Speaker 0: This is mostly true.

140
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,823
Speaker 0: However, I have found that government related websites.

141
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:54,548
Speaker 1: I can't use while I use Firefox you're totally right and we didn't even think to say anything about that.

142
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:59,430
Speaker 1: because Actually, I run into that a lot in New York State because there are a bunch of websites.

143
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,790
Speaker 1: We can look at New York State laws and submit forms and none of them work at all in Firefox.

144
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,743
Speaker 0: I forget if we discuss this on the show or in the forum or somewhere about you know how why open document formats were important.

145
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:23,310
Speaker 0: because you know If you don't have an open document format, then it's basically government forcing you to choose You know a particular piece of software in order to get things that should be free because your tax money paid for them.

146
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:29,250
Speaker 0: You know, it's kind of like if the government for you know uses this then that means you have to use this software.

147
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:40,309
Speaker 0: It would be the same as if the government made a road that only a Ford car could drive on so a government making a website that only an Internet Explorer can work on is equally bad.

148
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:54,615
Speaker 0: and I would submit that if I had more money and a lawyer if I encountered a government website that did not function in every Single web browser that exists and follows these standards for websites that I would sue and say hey You're you know,

149
00:11:54,675 --> 00:12:05,909
Speaker 1: the thing is I think he's talking probably more about Internal government or military, you know internet kind of sites where I mean if they give you the computer and they give you IE They can really kind of do that.

150
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,049
Speaker 0: But that is true.

151
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:13,249
Speaker 1: The one thing I'll say about that is that the military when it comes to technology is relatively smart.

152
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,071
Speaker 0: at least Yeah to me, but I don't know I've not.

153
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:21,537
Speaker 1: I mean it seems that from what I can gather because I have a lot of friends in the military Actually, they're ones that Scott doesn't know.

154
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:35,054
Speaker 1: They're my the other crew I hang out with but at you know Conventions and from what I can the military seems to move very slowly in adopting widely technology at least Technology that we would care about.

155
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:36,137
Speaker 1: there are other kinds of technology.

156
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:41,973
Speaker 1: They seem to adopt rather quickly maybe hastily even but it seems like Very slowly.

157
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:50,530
Speaker 1: they will lumber toward whatever is the most efficient thing and I wouldn't doubt for a second that Eventually the military will lumber toward open source.

158
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems to be slowly going that way.

159
00:12:53,325 --> 00:13:00,470
Speaker 0: You know the military You know in their search to you know, find whatever gives them some sort of combat advantage.

160
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:02,589
Speaker 0: I guess at least that's what it seems like they want.

161
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:09,950
Speaker 0: They're pretty much willing to try anything, you know, and they actually seriously check out what works the best for them.

162
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:18,444
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean like look at back during the not prohibition but integration and Segregation the military is one of the first organizations to say.

163
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,502
Speaker 1: All right, whatever We're mixing you all together because it's stupid to separate you.

164
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:24,009
Speaker 1: and yeah now go kill.

165
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,090
Speaker 0: Exactly, you know the when they're looking for some armor, you know.

166
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,530
Speaker 0: Then they go to all the companies that make armor and say hey, what do you got?

167
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,950
Speaker 0: And of course, it's probably some bribing and corruption in there.

168
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,170
Speaker 0: But if you take that out of the equation, yeah, and you can't I mean that's everywhere.

169
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:43,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, they seriously try to figure out what's the best, you know for the money and you know, they check shit out.

170
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,924
Speaker 0: So also let me finish his email.

171
00:13:44,944 --> 00:13:45,489
Speaker 0: It's kind of short.

172
00:13:46,152 --> 00:13:54,350
Speaker 0: This really ticks me off because I hate the times I have to use Internet Explorer while on government computers So when I have to use it on my own on my personal computer I hate it so much more.

173
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:58,082
Speaker 0: I'm with y'all on your feelings about Firefox versus Internet Explorer.

174
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:02,918
Speaker 1: Sincerely Robert from the army Well fight the good fight and hang on.

175
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,966
Speaker 1: maybe someday in the next 20 years or so.

176
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,150
Speaker 1: They'll move toward Firefox.

177
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:13,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe you know, I mean, I don't know much about the you know detailed organization of the US Army.

178
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,990
Speaker 0: But is there like a division that deals with IT stuff that you know, or is it contracted out?

179
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,705
Speaker 0: You know, there's got to be someone you can talk to or something.

180
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:32,184
Speaker 0: Yeah I actually I should ask some even even if you're not trying to convince them or you know Or switch them over you get at least like discuss it with them be like hey question them out.

181
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:33,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be cool.

182
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:37,644
Speaker 0: What is the government IT guy think about Firefox?

183
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:38,890
Speaker 0: Does he even know it exists?

184
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, thanks for email.

185
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:47,782
Speaker 1: I mean now that we're doing this geek back We're gonna actually probably read a lot of the feedback we get.

186
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:50,070
Speaker 1: so if you have anything to say to us send it in.

187
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:51,074
Speaker 0: We just got one.

188
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:53,546
Speaker 0: I think it's good for tomorrow, even though it's kind of long.

189
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,575
Speaker 1: I don't know I got one for tomorrow.

190
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,409
Speaker 0: Okay, then maybe it'll be delayed a week anyway.

191
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,226
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, so we also have some news and it's Monday so I don't feel bad doing a tech to it.

192
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:05,647
Speaker 1: news.

193
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,655
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, what's the news?

194
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,278
Speaker 1: you want to do it?

195
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:10,242
Speaker 1: Cuz this is the one you wanted.

196
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:11,287
Speaker 0: I've had the webpage open.

197
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:12,856
Speaker 0: neither Do I go.

198
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:13,782
Speaker 1: awesome great?

199
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:14,426
Speaker 1: All right.

200
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:32,403
Speaker 1: All right The long story short is this the individual story doesn't matter because the the base of this the crux of this is something that happens all the time a major company has a problem or Maybe is starting to lose market share to open source things.

201
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:39,150
Speaker 1: So the first thing they do is Blame open source for their trouble or they run negative ad campaigns.

202
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,610
Speaker 1: They spread some fud bud fud fud fud about open source.

203
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:46,718
Speaker 1: I'm sure you all know what FUD stands for.

204
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:47,280
Speaker 0: It's fear.

205
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,524
Speaker 0: and so I found the story.

206
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:50,370
Speaker 1: All right fear uncertainty and doubt.

207
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:57,907
Speaker 1: I actually did a speech about FUD at RIT when I took in a Communications class where I was public speaking and all that.

208
00:15:58,109 --> 00:15:58,330
Speaker 0: All right.

209
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:06,303
Speaker 0: So I think the first paragraph of this thing pretty much sums it up McAfee or McAfee or yeah McAfee Yeah, I've always heard McAfee.

210
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:15,441
Speaker 0: Yeah, they Hackers have borrowed the same open source development techniques used to build Firefox Apache and Linux as they collaborate on malware projects.

211
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:18,210
Speaker 0: a security company's researchers claim Monday.

212
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:20,330
Speaker 1: Alright McAfee, you know what?

213
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:20,809
Speaker 1: You know what?

214
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:30,002
Speaker 0: I want everyone to go to our forum and see the thing I wrote to classic brai about the history of Software development and the original hackers.

215
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:46,041
Speaker 0: people don't seem to realize all programming all computer programming was open source until The 70s, you know from the early days at MIT Up until the 70s all software was open source.

216
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:49,250
Speaker 0: in fact not open source was like a crazy idea.

217
00:16:49,591 --> 00:17:00,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I remember watching in my history of computing classes a lot of documentaries We read a lot of articles written by you know early computer hackers and early computer programmers Without exception.

218
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:13,097
Speaker 1: like one of them wrote about something like how one of his friends or someone in the computer club at MIT Had the idea like he was trying to sell a program and all of his friends Just kind of laughed at him like he was an idiot.

219
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, the word hacker comes from the MIT Railroad Club, I think it's the.

220
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:22,013
Speaker 0: I forget the exact name of it But what?

221
00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:31,070
Speaker 0: because people would you know, they would be in their little room working on their little model trains all day Hacking away on you know, because you're sitting under this big table hacking away on the train tracks.

222
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:40,949
Speaker 0: That's why they called him hackers But those were the guys who also did a bunch of computer stuff and they would take their source code and post it up on the wall for people to see and to share and to learn from.

223
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:47,050
Speaker 0: Hackers and people like that have been doing this as long as computers have existed.

224
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:52,130
Speaker 1: Yep, and I mean hacking doesn't just apply to computers I mean people hack things all the time if you're in an alley.

225
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:55,628
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that I don't want to talk about like, you know, the semantic definition of hacking.

226
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:57,839
Speaker 0: Well, yeah Hacking cracking white hat.

227
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a whole separate discuss head.

228
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:07,930
Speaker 0: The point is is that the open source development techniques have been around far longer than Firefox Apache or Linux.

229
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,030
Speaker 0: They've been around longer than the closed source development techniques.

230
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:22,670
Speaker 1: Also to extend their analogy and thus destroy their argument by means of what is almost a straw man They blame, you know, they say oh these botnet people use the same techniques that were used to make Firefox blah blah.

231
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:28,448
Speaker 1: You know what the US military uses many of the same techniques that were used by the Nazis in World War two.

232
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,389
Speaker 0: Oh God went alert.

233
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:33,256
Speaker 0: God win.

234
00:18:33,357 --> 00:18:34,284
Speaker 0: incoming God win.

235
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:38,710
Speaker 0: watch out We need a. we need a special God win alert sound effect.

236
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,324
Speaker 1: I was thinking about that as you were making those noises.

237
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:44,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's definitely Minds think alike, you know, yeah.

238
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:45,419
Speaker 1: Well real soon.

239
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,830
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start fiddling with the Mac like Hitler and Goebbels.

240
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:51,844
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll take some clips from the mr.

241
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:55,825
Speaker 1: Hilda sketch (Laughter).

242
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:08,066
Speaker 1: Things of the day Dinghy, all right.

243
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:17,019
Speaker 1: Now this might seem like a strange thing of the day So I'm gonna give you the background story as to how this came about and then I will reveal my thing of the day.

244
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,955
Speaker 1: So Scott and I last weekend this previous weekend.

245
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:25,979
Speaker 1: There was the first weekend We've had in almost all summer where we were free.

246
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:30,391
Speaker 1: We had absolutely no obligations responsibilities or plans.

247
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:31,654
Speaker 0: There was an end convention.

248
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:33,820
Speaker 0: There was no one coming to our house.

249
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,507
Speaker 0: We weren't going to anyone's house.

250
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,535
Speaker 0: We didn't have any family obligations.

251
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:38,640
Speaker 0: There was no holiday.

252
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:43,580
Speaker 0: There was nothing so we didn't have any errands to run that were urgent.

253
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:50,594
Speaker 1: Yep Thus we made a list and we drove up the road Into all the other towns went to every store we needed to do did everything.

254
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:57,579
Speaker 1: on the way back I stopped at a liquor store because I needed to replenish my supply of liquor Great, which I don't drink.

255
00:19:58,082 --> 00:20:02,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, not so much replenish as add to because I was missing a lot of key components like vermouth.

256
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:06,319
Speaker 1: I didn't have any vermouth, but that's beside the point.

257
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:10,600
Speaker 1: So we go into the liquor store, which is a massive high-class nice store.

258
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:19,558
Speaker 1: I mean, I like the place a lot and while I'm in the port section picking up a wine Scott asks where the mad train wine is.

259
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:28,253
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know mad train as in mad dog or night train or Thunderbird the stuff that winos buy in large quantity.

260
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,359
Speaker 0: that's mostly sugar.

261
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:32,793
Speaker 0: and Yeah, yeah, I wanted to see what it looked like.

262
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:34,000
Speaker 0: cuz you never really see that shit.

263
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:36,569
Speaker 1: He actually wanted to ask the guy at the store.

264
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,918
Speaker 1: Where's the stuff the winos by?

265
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:46,000
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean a big box of cheap one Yeah, but I mean the place doesn't even carry stuff like that, but we call it mad train wine.

266
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,990
Speaker 1: That's our catch-all because in Kingdom of Loathing a game.

267
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,409
Speaker 1: We don't play anymore, but was really fun while about a week Alcohol was a big part of that game.

268
00:20:54,469 --> 00:21:01,091
Speaker 1: It was a kind of an MMO text adventure thing and The cheapest primary alcohol was mad train wine.

269
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,837
Speaker 1: I'll play on mad dog and night train.

270
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:07,300
Speaker 1: We assume Yeah, I'm reasonably certain now.

271
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:08,729
Speaker 1: Then you know.

272
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:18,489
Speaker 1: then on the way home We were talking about you know all those wino type wines and making fun of it And we decided the next time we drove past the seedy liquor store We're gonna go in and get some just to laugh at it.

273
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,520
Speaker 0: I think we might actually just get a bottle of Thunderbird wine.

274
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:26,000
Speaker 0: Yeah So there it is Thunderbird wine.

275
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,810
Speaker 1: So yeah, so then I don't think we'd ever drink it.

276
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:30,134
Speaker 1: that stuff can't be.

277
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,720
Speaker 0: I might take like a spoonful of it Just to say yeah, I wouldn't drink it though.

278
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,340
Speaker 1: Well, I remember we both took a spoonful of that pushers rum and it tasted like unmitigated poison.

279
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:40,311
Speaker 0: I think it needs to be converted into grog.

280
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:42,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll make some grog at some point.

281
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:44,672
Speaker 1: I won't be drinking that got to take a tot of it at least.

282
00:21:44,712 --> 00:21:46,159
Speaker 1: then you can say you're a sailing man.

283
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,505
Speaker 0: I'm not a sailing man.

284
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,829
Speaker 0: In fact, I've never sailed.

285
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,073
Speaker 1: You're a software pirate.

286
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:51,976
Speaker 1: Yeah.

287
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:52,537
Speaker 1: Well you were.

288
00:21:52,557 --> 00:21:54,308
Speaker 0: yeah I was there now.

289
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:55,480
Speaker 0: I'm all open source in a fire.

290
00:21:56,622 --> 00:22:00,320
Speaker 1: Anyway, so we had a long discussion about why no wine.

291
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:01,945
Speaker 1: Then we get home.

292
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:05,520
Speaker 1: I come up to my room and what's the top story on FARC?

293
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,853
Speaker 1: How to make cheap wine and in the.

294
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:24,260
Speaker 1: the article was pretty good But the first link posted in the FARC thread which I'm already laughing about the fact that our lives are topical to FARC is How to make prison wine quite literally how to make sangria in the turn.

295
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:26,393
Speaker 0: Hey, you're making sangria in a toilet course.

296
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:40,900
Speaker 1: It's shanker B shanks and apparently in Prison the way people make wine they don't do it in the in the toilet so much But what they do is they'll take a trash bag.

297
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:51,179
Speaker 1: they fill it with all the fruit juices they can get their hands on all the sugar they can get their hands on and socks filled with moldy bread.

298
00:22:52,721 --> 00:23:03,300
Speaker 1: and these guys from this link on the internet did it and tasted it and It's like pretending to be in prison.

299
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:05,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, only without all the you know.

300
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,176
Speaker 1: fun prison rape exactly.

301
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:14,635
Speaker 1: yes Follow this FARC thread and the story and the first link in the FARC thread.

302
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:17,395
Speaker 1: if you want to learn a lot about things You should never ever drink.

303
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:22,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, if there's anything ever that you should not try at home.

304
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,059
Speaker 0: This is it.

305
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:26,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, prison wine is pretty much the bottom right?

306
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,920
Speaker 0: Oh, but but continuing our theme of you shouldn't do this is my thing of the day.

307
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,675
Speaker 1: I think you should do this cuz I was a punk kid like that once.

308
00:23:32,896 --> 00:23:33,540
Speaker 0: oh indeed indeed.

309
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,539
Speaker 0: But I also only suggest doing it if you were very good in the skills.

310
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:39,586
Speaker 1: These guys weren't so skilled.

311
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:41,131
Speaker 0: They were moderately skilled.

312
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:42,957
Speaker 1: They were but they fell all over their asses.

313
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:46,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, so Apparently there was this water park that was abandoned.

314
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:53,900
Speaker 0: It looks a lot like action park to me But it's not action park because I found some abandoned pictures of action park on the internet.

315
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,860
Speaker 0: And this is not it because there was one slide that both parks have.

316
00:23:58,201 --> 00:24:01,110
Speaker 0: But the slide at this park was blue and yellow an action park.

317
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,039
Speaker 0: It was red and yellow, so it's not action park.

318
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:13,074
Speaker 0: this is a bunch of punk kids who sneak into this abandoned water park and They rollerblade on the dried up water slide.

319
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:14,360
Speaker 1: It's pretty badass.

320
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:20,340
Speaker 0: While it's crazy dangerous Crazy stupid it's crazy awesome.

321
00:24:20,864 --> 00:24:29,960
Speaker 1: Also when I watched it It was really awesome And it really brought me back to my days as a punk rollerblading kid even though I could do like two tricks.

322
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:36,787
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just mostly rollerbladed around for fun and every time I tried to do tricks I'd hurt myself, and then I'd give up immediately.

323
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:40,880
Speaker 0: yeah these guys seem to have you know a moderate average level of trick skills.

324
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:43,040
Speaker 0: You know they grind on the side of the slides.

325
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:47,000
Speaker 0: They can jump from one slide to the other which is probably the coolest part of the video.

326
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:51,277
Speaker 1: But actually the music in the video is way cool.

327
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:54,392
Speaker 0: if anyone knows What song they're playing in this video?

328
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:55,799
Speaker 0: I want to know because it's a good song.

329
00:24:55,939 --> 00:25:02,680
Speaker 1: yeah Cuz I really don't feel like doing research to find it But it was a song that I'd never heard before and I never heard anything quite like it before.

330
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:12,099
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean it's similar to some of those hip-hop type remixes where they take an old song and they sample it And they remix it to hell and make it awesome, but I don't know I like it.

331
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:14,028
Speaker 0: I like it, and I want to know what it is.

332
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:18,443
Speaker 0: so someone tell me and also these kids are Good kids.

333
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:22,779
Speaker 0: yeah, I want to see more and there's no belly man coming to beat them up.

334
00:25:23,703 --> 00:25:24,387
Speaker 1: He was on his way.

335
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:25,070
Speaker 1: Just took him a while.

336
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,713
Speaker 1: You know that belly.

337
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:35,764
Speaker 1: You know I know right Yep, so anyway today is Monday, which is science technology gadgetry Linux computers and Science fiction.

338
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:44,317
Speaker 1: yes, we have decided to add science fiction to Monday Mostly because the only other place it could fit is Wednesday or Thursday.

339
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:48,619
Speaker 1: both days We already have far more content than we'll ever get to.

340
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:52,459
Speaker 0: yeah, and you know it it really only fits in on Monday.

341
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:57,039
Speaker 0: and I mean you think I think we did a Thursday on Star Wars a long time ago.

342
00:25:57,261 --> 00:26:05,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if we start really doing more sci-fi stuff I mean there's still this room on Monday to put that there isn't room on Thursday.

343
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:07,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Wednesday is our fullest day.

344
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:16,340
Speaker 0: and also you know for us being super do-everything geeky geeks that we are We're not so much sci-fi.

345
00:26:16,862 --> 00:26:19,092
Speaker 1: Well it I I am more than Scott.

346
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:19,574
Speaker 1: Yes.

347
00:26:19,835 --> 00:26:21,000
Speaker 1: I mean I loved Firefly.

348
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,280
Speaker 1: I think Battlestar Galactica the original and the new one are both awesome.

349
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:29,319
Speaker 1: I absolutely loved the next generation and the original Star Trek.

350
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:30,282
Speaker 0: yeah See I don't like.

351
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:34,656
Speaker 0: it's pretty much almost no science fiction television shows that I like.

352
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:43,320
Speaker 0: like the stuff That is essentially you know just stories that happen to be in space or stories that happen to involve crazy technology or the future.

353
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:51,840
Speaker 1: I'm generally not always a fan of What if they made a TV series or a movie based on like stranger in a strange land?

354
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,404
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was well done.

355
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:55,828
Speaker 0: So that's the thing is stuff.

356
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:56,430
Speaker 0: That's like.

357
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,995
Speaker 0: I really only like.

358
00:26:58,295 --> 00:27:03,011
Speaker 0: you know the quote hard Sci-fi like you know Twilight Zone.

359
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,860
Speaker 0: some of it is hard sci-fi.

360
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,823
Speaker 0: You know stuff like that.

361
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:10,400
Speaker 0: you know stranger in a strange land is a real hard science fiction foundation.

362
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:11,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

363
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:15,255
Speaker 0: and I also like the classic sci-fi which you know.

364
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:16,078
Speaker 0: foundation.

365
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:19,109
Speaker 0: yeah This stuff you know Star Trek.

366
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:20,496
Speaker 0: I really don't like Star Trek.

367
00:27:20,536 --> 00:27:21,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, or just like stuff.

368
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,087
Speaker 0: It just doesn't do anything for me at all.

369
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, we both very much like things by.

370
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:25,999
Speaker 1: you know William Gibson Neil.

371
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,782
Speaker 0: So those are cyberpunk, which is like a sub-genre, but yeah But it's it's there.

372
00:27:30,003 --> 00:27:45,135
Speaker 0: the point is is that we're not the hugest super sci-fi nerds like some people and therefore There's plenty of room on Monday to put a little bit of science fiction that we have Especially since we're reading a lot more now that at least in terms of the podcast.

373
00:27:45,476 --> 00:27:48,606
Speaker 1: It doesn't take us any Extraordinary effort to do the episode.

374
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:52,738
Speaker 0: yeah most of the sci-fi that will do will be novels that we have read.

375
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:56,420
Speaker 1: yeah So so today we decided we do it.

376
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:02,120
Speaker 1: We'll probably talk about both of these again after we both read the other one, but Scott is currently reading something.

377
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,825
Speaker 0: Well, I finished it.

378
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:07,560
Speaker 1: Well that you finished the first one of the series about that Yep, and I recently finished a book.

379
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:11,213
Speaker 1: They're both very good science fiction, and we'll both just kind of talk about them.

380
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,240
Speaker 1: all right, so you want to go first.

381
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:15,871
Speaker 0: Okay, I read it's like a little.

382
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:17,800
Speaker 0: it's the geek nights book club that we talked about.

383
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:25,207
Speaker 0: I just finished reading Galactic Patrol by EE doc Smith.

384
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:32,609
Speaker 0: doc is one of those you know nicknames and quotes in the middle there and This is the first book in the lens min series.

385
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,825
Speaker 1: now you may or may not have heard of lens min from the anime Pretend.

386
00:28:37,886 --> 00:28:39,018
Speaker 1: it doesn't exist for now.

387
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:40,985
Speaker 0: Yes in the future.

388
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:47,184
Speaker 0: We will probably do a giant all lens min episode with all the books and the anime and the whole thing But not right now.

389
00:28:47,485 --> 00:28:48,669
Speaker 0: That'll be for another time.

390
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,693
Speaker 1: Yes, perhaps.

391
00:28:49,713 --> 00:28:51,500
Speaker 1: You will do it with anime world order.

392
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,179
Speaker 0: Now what can I say about this book?

393
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,519
Speaker 0: Well, it's pretty short.

394
00:28:56,741 --> 00:29:05,891
Speaker 0: So you know if even if you're the kind of person who can't handle like a giant book or lots of really hard Writing this is not that this is very you know.

395
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:09,603
Speaker 0: it's moderately easy to read for any literate Adult.

396
00:29:10,406 --> 00:29:11,550
Speaker 0: it doesn't take long.

397
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,714
Speaker 0: it reads pretty quickly.

398
00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:17,480
Speaker 0: if you don't you know mull over it Which you probably shouldn't have to and it's enjoyable.

399
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:28,136
Speaker 0: It's lacking in Like you know depth and hardcore and I say you know I expected more of a hard science fiction book and that's not really what you get.

400
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:31,258
Speaker 0: you get more of a space adventure of awesome.

401
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:39,525
Speaker 0: it reminds me a lot actually of a a lot of those manga that we read like the political ones like Sanctuary and Eagle.

402
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:44,119
Speaker 0: not because it's political because it really isn't very political at all.

403
00:29:45,092 --> 00:29:50,879
Speaker 0: but Lensman is about you know a guy who's just badass and awesome and does the smart thing.

404
00:29:51,544 --> 00:30:03,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems very rare that characters in things we watch or read will do the obvious smart thing or the thing that we would do or Something smarter than we would have even thought to do.

405
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,220
Speaker 1: It's usually ah you dumbass.

406
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's sort of like.

407
00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:08,248
Speaker 0: there are certain things like you know.

408
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:12,380
Speaker 0: normally if you watch a sitcom on TV or any drama it all.

409
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:27,204
Speaker 0: I have a theory that Scott's hypothesis of the drama stupidity the drama stupidity Hypothesis and where there cannot be drama it without stupidity because if everyone is smart there won't be anything Happening to cause drama.

410
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:29,290
Speaker 1: well I can think of one exception.

411
00:30:29,732 --> 00:30:32,620
Speaker 1: Let's say we've got two nations fighting over resources.

412
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:33,304
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

413
00:30:33,324 --> 00:30:35,295
Speaker 0: They're both smart you get but you get.

414
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:41,678
Speaker 1: my point is yeah Yeah, when you know what drama in the OMG drama sense as opposed to drama.

415
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:49,008
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly You know it's oh my god, so and so ban me from her live journal because so and so thinks the so-and-so's cheating on so And so after I read.

416
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,117
Speaker 0: okay, that's enough of that.

417
00:30:51,203 --> 00:31:00,280
Speaker 0: When you know you watch sitcoms and things on TV and it most movies Hollywood movies you know you see characters do things that are stupid, and it pisses you off cuz like why didn't you do this?

418
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:07,100
Speaker 1: Oh, it was so obvious What god like in Nana that we just watched an episode of where a character did something real dumb exactly?

419
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,255
Speaker 0: Lensman is actually about a guy who can't be stupid.

420
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:13,560
Speaker 0: you see it starts out.

421
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:15,989
Speaker 0: Well, let me let me give you a picture of this universe you ready.

422
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:17,917
Speaker 0: It's a space universe.

423
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:18,620
Speaker 0: people can.

424
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,040
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

425
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:27,068
Speaker 0: Actually the way they fly through space faster than light is they remove inertia like the spaceships.

426
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:33,439
Speaker 0: they take inertia out of the spaceships, and then they go away and They're constantly talking about how they're gonna.

427
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,799
Speaker 0: You know landing free or you know going inert and the people can go inert and un-inert with.

428
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:41,670
Speaker 0: you know They have devices to help them do this.

429
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:43,120
Speaker 0: It's not just a magic powers.

430
00:31:44,523 --> 00:31:54,639
Speaker 0: So they're always talking about like oh, you know You know if you start running then you take away your inertia And then you put it back on you'll still be going forward because the inertia was still from before.

431
00:31:55,565 --> 00:32:04,392
Speaker 0: So like you take your spaceship off then you go You know you remove the inertia then landing is always tricky And it's pretty cool when they they deal with that in a somewhat.

432
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:10,284
Speaker 0: I guess realistic way yeah, but no it's a universe.

433
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:13,310
Speaker 0: or people can fly around real fast from planet to planet.

434
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:21,055
Speaker 0: and And There is one civilization called the Galactic Patrol, and it's a relatively new civilization.

435
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:27,809
Speaker 0: and there is another civilization called Boscone or Boscone, I can't really tell because it's a book.

436
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:42,050
Speaker 0: Boscone yeah, B O S K O N E and Basically, they're quote space pirates, but really they're not space pirates They're you know like in the classic sense even though they do a lot of space pirating.

437
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:44,779
Speaker 0: They're sort of an evil galactic civilization.

438
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:45,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, too late.

439
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:47,930
Speaker 1: I realize me children are me only treasure.

440
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:56,867
Speaker 0: Yeah, that Boscone is an old and powerful Galactic civilization that is much much more powerful than the Galactic Patrol.

441
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:57,549
Speaker 0: who are the good guys?

442
00:32:58,372 --> 00:32:58,553
Speaker 0: now?

443
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:13,304
Speaker 0: the story follows Kimball Kennison who is a guy who goes to the Galactic Patrol Academy and he eventually becomes a lensman which is the absolute ultimate Policeman of the Galactic Patrol you can possibly be.

444
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,414
Speaker 0: and You know.

445
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:25,590
Speaker 0: the very first chapter is where the guy says you know You can't fake being a lensman because you get this lens from these aliens or whatever and you'll find out all about that.

446
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,310
Speaker 0: That would be a spoiler if I told you anymore.

447
00:33:27,992 --> 00:33:32,546
Speaker 0: So you have a. it's a lensman are guys who are perfect in every way.

448
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:33,770
Speaker 0: They will not be corrupt.

449
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:34,734
Speaker 0: Guaranteed.

450
00:33:35,216 --> 00:33:35,980
Speaker 0: you can trust them.

451
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,230
Speaker 0: guaranteed you do what they say no matter what?

452
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:40,177
Speaker 0: They will always make the best decision.

453
00:33:40,277 --> 00:33:41,301
Speaker 0: They're always awesome.

454
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:43,850
Speaker 0: You know, they're better than all other people in every way.

455
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:54,330
Speaker 0: They can act as judge jury and executioner and you can trust that that will be better than any other Judge jury and executioner that you can find guaranteed.

456
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:55,052
Speaker 0: It's not.

457
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:57,138
Speaker 0: and you know, there's no drama in the book.

458
00:33:57,218 --> 00:33:59,204
Speaker 0: Like where a lensman is gone bad.

459
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:00,167
Speaker 0: No lensman.

460
00:34:00,227 --> 00:34:02,074
Speaker 0: Don't go bad Period.

461
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:03,342
Speaker 0: they are good guys.

462
00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:05,813
Speaker 0: the end end of story You know.

463
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:07,477
Speaker 0: and the because the in.

464
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,964
Speaker 0: they explain like the selection process for lensman.

465
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:12,090
Speaker 0: they weed out any possible bad guy.

466
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,364
Speaker 0: You know, they're like amazing amazing dudes with the slightest fallibility.

467
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:16,827
Speaker 0: Oh, sorry.

468
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:17,509
Speaker 0: I can't be a lensman.

469
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:24,429
Speaker 0: So yeah, you have this guy Kimball kindnessing as a brand new lensman and they send him on what's essentially a suicide mission.

470
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:30,609
Speaker 0: You see I told you before that the they can't beat the aliens who are much much more powerful than they are.

471
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:33,812
Speaker 0: well, they give him a Spaceship.

472
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:35,717
Speaker 0: that is sort of crazy.

473
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:50,590
Speaker 0: Like it has a very different combat strategy from the standard combat strategy But the chances of him actually succeeding in destroying or capturing an alien vessel and stealing alien technology is somewhat slim But it kind of puts him on the fast track.

474
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,509
Speaker 0: It's like if you pull this off you're gonna go way up in the lensman, but if you don't you're dead.

475
00:34:56,516 --> 00:35:03,051
Speaker 0: So, of course being a lensman He goes off on this mission and I don't want to tell you the rest of the plot because there's no point in reading the Book.

476
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're definitely not reviewing our things.

477
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of giving them the once-over.

478
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:10,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, I don't want to talk too long.

479
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:11,630
Speaker 0: I'm gonna end this up pretty quick.

480
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:23,760
Speaker 0: But the rest of the book is Kimball Kennison being awesome as he goes from thing to thing Doing the awesomest thing possible always pulling off the incredibly amazing thing.

481
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,535
Speaker 0: and you know, the reason you want to keep reading is To find out.

482
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:31,187
Speaker 0: All right, how the hell is he gonna do that?

483
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:31,890
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

484
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:34,215
Speaker 0: Well, how the hell is he gonna do?

485
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:37,207
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I get the what's he gonna do next.

486
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:43,430
Speaker 1: holy crap See, I didn't read it at all yet But I get the impression that it'll feel a lot like the Horatio books in me.

487
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,704
Speaker 0: That's the impression that I get not having actually read a Horatio book.

488
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've read all of them.

489
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,257
Speaker 1: I've read almost everything CS foresters written.

490
00:35:50,278 --> 00:36:00,163
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It even has the the guy who's sort of it, you know Haines who's sort of like the the boss But he's not really the boss, but you'll that's doesn't matter.

491
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:01,870
Speaker 0: It's sort of like tell you you know, you always.

492
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:05,821
Speaker 0: He always takes care of Kimball, you know, he gives him what he needs.

493
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:08,147
Speaker 0: He tells him what he needs to be told etcetera, etcetera.

494
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,120
Speaker 0: It's way cool.

495
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:11,149
Speaker 0: Yeah way cool.

496
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:17,572
Speaker 0: I'll be reading it soon and then I can see why all those people were inspired to like make lensman anime and lensman Comic books.

497
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:20,462
Speaker 1: if only they hadn't been if only they died.

498
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:26,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I'm not gonna talk about the lensman anime, but good fucking God.

499
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:30,112
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah lensman book is definitely, you know The books.

500
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:36,210
Speaker 0: make sure you go to Wikipedia before you read them to find out the correct reading order.

501
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:45,275
Speaker 0: Yes, if you look at the books themselves if you can find them, they're pretty cheap and use bookstores They will tell you to read them.

502
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:50,710
Speaker 0: They'll tell you to first read triplanetary and then read first lensman and then read galactic patrol.

503
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:53,145
Speaker 0: That's sort of not correct.

504
00:36:53,206 --> 00:36:59,350
Speaker 0: See Triplanetary and first lensman were prequels that were made and published later.

505
00:37:00,212 --> 00:37:02,104
Speaker 0: So that's sort of like you get spoilers.

506
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:11,576
Speaker 1: if you read those first It's like I think you get a lot more out of Star Wars watching four five six one two three then watching one two three four five six Exactly, or even Horatio.

507
00:37:11,877 --> 00:37:16,671
Speaker 1: the order they were written and the order you're supposed to read them is way out of chronological order Mm-hmm.

508
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:28,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, the lensman books are numbered for you to read them in chronological story order But really you should read them in Publication order which is galactic patrol gray lensman.

509
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:31,510
Speaker 0: I forget but Wikipedia has it listed.

510
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,785
Speaker 0: Go to Wikipedia for lensman and read it and make sure you read the books in the right order.

511
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:43,410
Speaker 1: Yep So as I've mentioned a bunch of times I was reading the difference engine by William Gibson.

512
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:48,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, and oh god, I forget the other author's name or the book handy, but it's co-written by him and someone else.

513
00:37:48,673 --> 00:37:49,541
Speaker 0: Oh, I'll look it up.

514
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:57,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, but It's hard science fiction, but you know, there are basically two ways to tell hard science fiction.

515
00:37:57,532 --> 00:38:04,016
Speaker 1: There are the stories that like have the omniscient narrator and they're like there was this civilization and then this happened.

516
00:38:04,176 --> 00:38:13,037
Speaker 1: or you know follow the broad strokes of the leaders of these countries of the leaders of these civilizations and you know Very epic wide scale wide lens.

517
00:38:13,899 --> 00:38:18,972
Speaker 1: and then there's the science fiction where you set up the world the science fiction world You want to explore.

518
00:38:19,574 --> 00:38:27,518
Speaker 1: and then you explore it by following a character or a few characters through that world on a semi Unrelated plot Bruce Sterling.

519
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:28,702
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bruce Sterling.

520
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:35,085
Speaker 1: There you go author of a holy fire I believe but it you have a plot that isn't like the plot itself in.

521
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,650
Speaker 1: the difference engine is kind of me.

522
00:38:36,993 --> 00:38:39,959
Speaker 1: It's just this kind of you know Skullduggery and adventure.

523
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,432
Speaker 1: it follows one character for a while Then it kills.

524
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:45,241
Speaker 1: that storyline follows a different character for a while kills.

525
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,050
Speaker 1: that storyline follows a third character until it ends.

526
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,338
Speaker 1: But that's really beside the point.

527
00:38:50,819 --> 00:39:06,210
Speaker 1: the book itself really explores an interesting idea now Babbage and numerous other people throughout history had come up with Mechanical means of doing what computers today do just on a much slower massive scale.

528
00:39:06,892 --> 00:39:12,910
Speaker 1: But they came up with you know difference engines machines that could calculate add and subtract multiply and divide.

529
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,889
Speaker 1: There were just were never really the resources to build any of these machines.

530
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:22,950
Speaker 1: and Even if they had been built the theory behind building them, they would have been very difficult.

531
00:39:23,313 --> 00:39:24,970
Speaker 1: It would have been very engineering intensive.

532
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:33,769
Speaker 1: It's still not known if it would be even possible to make an engine large enough to do anything useful Yet still able to function.

533
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:42,590
Speaker 1: but regardless of all that the idea here is what if Babbage had gotten the funding and the money he needed to build a difference engine?

534
00:39:43,471 --> 00:39:44,454
Speaker 1: And what if it had worked?

535
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:49,730
Speaker 1: and what if the information revolution had happened during the Industrial Revolution?

536
00:39:50,210 --> 00:40:02,610
Speaker 1: instead of you know in the 1960s 70s 80s 90s and it's really just a fascinating look at how Vastly different and yet in a lot of ways how the same history would have been.

537
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:35,150
Speaker 1: I mean it puts forth a lot of the ideas that if these things existed They were so massive and would have taken so many resources that Only the old world powers like Britain and France and Japan and China could have possibly built them Which means that all of these nations would have remained powerful through the Industrial Revolution and beyond Instead of what we saw happening where new upstart countries that didn't have a lot of knowledge and technology But had a lot of resources and people eventually overshadowed them.

538
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:51,729
Speaker 1: I mean, it's it's set in a world where the Civil War kind of ended in a truce and For Britain and France and all these countries because they had the technology and the information really worked to make sure countries like America and Germany never unified and never became threats.

539
00:40:51,749 --> 00:41:09,628
Speaker 1: and it really goes into a lot of theory of computation Turing machines and it goes a lot into how different our history would be if meritocracy and science were lauded as opposed to religion and emotionalism and reactionism and all those sorts of things.

540
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:11,171
Speaker 1: I mean they.

541
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:21,493
Speaker 1: it gets to the point where they talk about how the noble classes were kind of abolished and people were given nobility based on their achievements and they weren't hereditary and little asides.

542
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:33,075
Speaker 1: a whole bunch of little things where they'll mention you know, like remember the potato famine in Ireland and how Britain and France shipped all those tinned foods over made by machines and save the day Little things like that.

543
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:34,842
Speaker 1: It's a really fascinating read.

544
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:35,886
Speaker 1: I blew through it.

545
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:36,268
Speaker 1: It was just.

546
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:36,730
Speaker 1: I loved it.

547
00:41:37,172 --> 00:41:50,689
Speaker 1: I've been very vague on a lot of the details of the book mostly because like Scott I don't want to ruin it for anyone because there are Quite a number of twists and the story itself is pulpy like very pulpy But it's very fun.

548
00:41:51,251 --> 00:42:02,301
Speaker 1: and in addition to that the fun story really guides you through this world and really shows you all of the Amazing things that humans could have accomplished if we'd had the information revolution sooner.

549
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:10,949
Speaker 1: and it also really paints a semi optimistic picture of Now that we're in full swing and the information revolution has been happening for so long.

550
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:19,429
Speaker 1: Just the heights we can take it to now that I mean the machines we've got are billions and billions of times more powerful than what is posited in this book.

551
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:23,586
Speaker 1: and Yet look at what people could have done with machines at even that week.

552
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:27,270
Speaker 0: and that Unpowerful It's only powerful.

553
00:42:27,602 --> 00:42:40,398
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm running out of English here because I'm really trying to not ruin anything about this book because I really recommend anyone who enjoys science fiction or computing or Victorian pulp crap action.

554
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,890
Speaker 1: all of these are in this book and it's very much worth reading.

555
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, lens min is pretty much like the same thing.

556
00:42:47,286 --> 00:42:50,801
Speaker 0: just you know It constantly just gets bigger and bigger and crazier and crazier.

557
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:57,310
Speaker 0: just a guy flying around in space You know pulling off amazing things to fight against the evil space pirates.

558
00:42:57,773 --> 00:43:00,630
Speaker 1: I noticed they both definitely have this idea of meritocracy.

559
00:43:01,132 --> 00:43:02,619
Speaker 1: I mean the lens min are infallible.

560
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:04,949
Speaker 1: you take the people who are awesome and you put them in charge.

561
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:11,108
Speaker 0: Well, the lens min aren't really like governing it's sort of but you put them in like people.

562
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,316
Speaker 1: you see a lens min You go I'll listen to that guy.

563
00:43:13,536 --> 00:43:18,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems to me like the in lens min The.

564
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:25,343
Speaker 0: it's pretty obvious that the Galactic Patrol the good Civilization there is never any in fighting in the Galactic Patrol.

565
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:30,820
Speaker 0: everyone in the Galactic Patrol Even if they're not lens min awesome, they're good.

566
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,525
Speaker 0: They never do anything bad.

567
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:38,130
Speaker 0: They don't turn coat They they always do their job really really well.

568
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:42,901
Speaker 0: They're all awesome Good guys all working on the same team and united hurrah.

569
00:43:43,442 --> 00:44:02,138
Speaker 0: and the bad guys are the ones that have in fighting and all sorts of other stuff, but you know, it's just so many Things that you see today, you know in all sorts of entertainment, you know If there's a team of good guys, even if it's just two good guys, there's always conflict within between everything.

570
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:14,465
Speaker 0: they always set up a conflict between every possible character imaginable and it's just really enjoyable to see like this giant team of awesome Perfectly marching forward towards goodness without anything wrong with them.

571
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:15,730
Speaker 0: Just doing the greatest.

572
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:24,813
Speaker 1: yeah, the most of the conflict in the difference engine is generally very silly and over-the-top and well over the top in a Subdued way.

573
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:27,743
Speaker 1: It's really hard to explain but it's kind of Oh Tally Ho.

574
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:30,257
Speaker 1: Let's go off on the adventure and aha We won't die.

575
00:44:30,297 --> 00:44:31,227
Speaker 1: We're the main characters.

576
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:45,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, the the conflict in lens min is actually while it's sort of fantastic in its Spaceness, you know with aliens and lasers and spaceships and shit But it's not really like Tally Ho.

577
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:51,786
Speaker 1: it's like, oh, yeah See the real conflict in difference engine is much more subtle and not we're comparing two books.

578
00:44:51,806 --> 00:44:52,930
Speaker 0: They've done to do with each other.

579
00:44:53,011 --> 00:45:10,836
Speaker 1: Yes apples and oranges for the win but the conflict the real conflict which is very subtle and kind of you figure out going on that it's really Luddites and reactionaries versus science and technology religion versus technology Idiots versus not idiots.

580
00:45:11,598 --> 00:45:43,490
Speaker 1: I mean the one of the major pivotal points is that the communists have a Very very big advantage in a world like this because information is so much more free and available that it's much more easy for communists and socialist sympathizers to mobilize especially back in the turn of the century in the Industrial Revolution when There was a lot of communist sympathy and a lot of people especially for the working conditions at the time Really probably would have joined any communist revolution if they'd known that one existed.

581
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:55,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot to the difference engine and actually my favorite part of the whole thing is there are the equiv the not the Industrial Revolution equivalent of data centers.

582
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:56,821
Speaker 1: and it's just.

583
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:59,850
Speaker 1: it's really funny because there's the guys sitting in there and they talk about.

584
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:06,380
Speaker 1: It goes into kind of great detail about all the steam and the tubes and the and the little widgets and pipes and the people wearing the.

585
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:11,549
Speaker 1: you know they don't let people smoke in there anymore because they realize the smoke in the air interfered with the gears.

586
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:13,790
Speaker 1: and It's just really really cool.

587
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:24,510
Speaker 1: Like they talk about gear yards like my computer has 100 gear yards and there's a funny scene where one guy who thought he knew about computers was like Yeah, how many gear yards you have here at you know?

588
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:29,230
Speaker 1: He's at like the government center for computing and the government center guy says gear yards.

589
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:36,010
Speaker 1: We measure them in gear miles now boy There's a lot of little bits like that.

590
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:38,094
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good one.

591
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:39,137

592
00:46:39,257 --> 00:46:43,110
