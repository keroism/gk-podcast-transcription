1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,746
Speaker 1: It's Monday September 29th.

2
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:12,468
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:14,934
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:18,340
Speaker 1: We talk about the cloud buzzword computing.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,916
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:31,866
Speaker 0: Hey rim, you know what today is.

7
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:33,481
Speaker 1: What is today?

8
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:37,712
Speaker 0: It's your favorite holiday Monday Rosh Hashanah, oh Okay.

9
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:39,279
Speaker 0: Yeah now you can eat.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,110
Speaker 0: your eating of honey on challah will be appropriate.

11
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:46,149
Speaker 1: So what's wrong with the fact that I eat milk and honey and challah only without the milk?

12
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:51,227
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with it, but it's sort of it's like if someone ate a green bagel, but it wasn't st.

13
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:51,810
Speaker 0: Patrick's Day.

14
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:52,974
Speaker 0: That's what it's sort of like.

15
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:56,890
Speaker 1: It's I think it's more like eating cake when it's not your birthday or anyone else's birthday.

16
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:57,730
Speaker 0: No, that's okay.

17
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,810
Speaker 0: You can eat cake all the time.

18
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,110
Speaker 1: But so you realize honey on bread has been a staple of non Jewish people for a long time.

19
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:04,962
Speaker 1: The Greeks would eat honey without even the bread.

20
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:05,970
Speaker 1: They just need honeysuckle.

21
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, but because it's Rosh Hashanah, you have to get around challah.

22
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:11,110
Speaker 0: You can't get the normal braided one.

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,673
Speaker 0: You have to get around.

24
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:12,577
Speaker 1: why would I do that?

25
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:13,562
Speaker 1: I like the braided ones.

26
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:18,133
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that's what the holiday is What I don't have a holla Gonna do.

27
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:19,057
Speaker 0: you should go get one.

28
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:20,644
Speaker 1: I didn't get one shit.

29
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,468
Speaker 0: You're fucking it all up.

30
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,810
Speaker 1: Actually, the reason I didn't get one is because I got a beard popper, right and I thought I'd bring one home to Emily.

31
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:31,510
Speaker 1: So I was like, alright and I bought two and I ate one and I put the other one in the fridge.

32
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:33,590
Speaker 1: And then I you know, I'm working a little late.

33
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,010
Speaker 1: But when I say I work late, that means I worked like two minutes late.

34
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:38,958
Speaker 1: So it's like oh crap gotta go.

35
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,030
Speaker 1: so I walk out the door and I get to the elevator.

36
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,166
Speaker 1: I'm like no my beard papa.

37
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,326
Speaker 1: So I walk halfway back to my office and then I'm like shit.

38
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:47,612
Speaker 1: now I won't have time Indecision.

39
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,787
Speaker 1: and I just went back to the elevator and I went down barely got on my train.

40
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:52,413
Speaker 1: then I'm like, ah I wanted a loaf of bread.

41
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,601
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll get some breads tomorrow.

42
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:57,430
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe actually no, I just bought a loaf of bread.

43
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,077
Speaker 1: We've got two loaves of normal bread now.

44
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:00,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a thread in the forums.

45
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:02,210
Speaker 0: I started right about bread.

46
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:05,763
Speaker 0: No, I was writing a post in it and then a post about.

47
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:07,650
Speaker 1: I can't think of any synonym that rhymes with post.

48
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,333
Speaker 1: That means bread.

49
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:13,496
Speaker 1: I don't know host host like in Catholic Church About host.

50
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:14,908
Speaker 1: I'm on a roll.

51
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,909
Speaker 1: You realize that I just needed to read jokes that I could then say I'm on a roll.

52
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,380
Speaker 1: Realize how wonderful that was to actually pull that off.

53
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,870
Speaker 1: No, I don't think you understand.

54
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:30,438
Speaker 0: He throw me off.

55
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:31,709
Speaker 0: I was writing a post in the forums.

56
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:36,468
Speaker 0: I got distracted and then I didn't realize it was time to leave work and I saw the clock.

57
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:38,729
Speaker 0: I said, oh shit I just deleted the post and didn't post it.

58
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:42,590
Speaker 1: You know, actually someone who in the forum read and posted forever they posted.

59
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:48,068
Speaker 1: I've noticed we get a lot of people who join the forum and they like don't post for like four or five months.

60
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:59,070
Speaker 1: then suddenly they start posting and one of them basically said yeah, actually I've started a lot of posts and then I Look at it and then I just decide it wasn't worth it and then halfway through I just click back.

61
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:02,225
Speaker 0: Actually, my post was worth it, but I feel like it's too much.

62
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:03,330
Speaker 0: I don't I don't want to type at all.

63
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,701
Speaker 1: Well, I realize one I do that with about half the thing.

64
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:11,113
Speaker 1: half the time I start to respond to something in the forum I'll get halfway through it.

65
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:12,778
Speaker 1: then just go a fuck it and close the tab.

66
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,107
Speaker 0: a couple other items of interest, right?

67
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:24,010
Speaker 0: I was for people who don't know Commerce Bank, I don't know if there's a Commerce Bank near you, but there's some in Manhattan, right?

68
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,358
Speaker 0: They have a machine called the penny arcade.

69
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:29,050
Speaker 0: if I mentioned this on the show before I think you did once a lot.

70
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:34,770
Speaker 0: I mentioned it not on the show, but I you know mentioning on the show just for good measure a second time maybe.

71
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:39,710
Speaker 0: And the penny arcade not related to the webcomic is basically a coin star machine.

72
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,252
Speaker 0: You dump change in it and then they give you a receipt and then you get cash for your receipt Right.

73
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:45,637
Speaker 1: Well, there's a cat or a check.

74
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:46,319
Speaker 1: There's a catch.

75
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:47,464
Speaker 0: What's the catch?

76
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:49,090
Speaker 1: They don't take any of your money.

77
00:03:50,452 --> 00:04:00,188
Speaker 0: Exactly yeah, unlike a coin star machine which takes money, you know charges a fee or you know forces you to get gift cards if you want all your money.

78
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:14,010
Speaker 0: or Other banks which will only accept change if you roll it up and only accept change, you know If you're a have an account there man The Commerce Bank lets you just anyone just dump change it in the machine and convert it.

79
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,221
Speaker 0: I went into the bank today and I said is this for real?

80
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:20,909
Speaker 0: and there was a person there and then she was all nice And she was like, yes, it's totally for real.

81
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,487
Speaker 0: So tomorrow I'm gonna bring an entire gallon of change down.

82
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:25,210
Speaker 0: wait tomorrow.

83
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:28,303
Speaker 1: You've been saying you're going to do this for like a year.

84
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:29,187
Speaker 0: I'm doing it tomorrow.

85
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,362
Speaker 0: cuz I'm it's full I can't fit any more change in it.

86
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:32,230
Speaker 0: I have to do it tomorrow.

87
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,124
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess my problem is I have a much larger thing to put change in.

88
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:37,570
Speaker 0: you're gonna carry that to the city.

89
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:39,140
Speaker 1: No, it's already too heavy.

90
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:40,690
Speaker 0: We can carry it together.

91
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,282
Speaker 1: Also at now that I've been reading the life and times of Scrooge McDuck.

92
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:46,510
Speaker 1: I kind of don't want to ever get rid of it.

93
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,918
Speaker 0: Well, you see yeah, you got it.

94
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:52,110
Speaker 0: If Scrooge is alive today, he would have dumped it in the machine.

95
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:57,508
Speaker 0: He would have just you know You would have gone specifically to that machine because it's such a long trek carrying a heavy thing.

96
00:04:57,568 --> 00:04:59,298
Speaker 0: hard work To get it converted.

97
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:01,230
Speaker 0: and then you know, put it somewhere where it gets interest.

98
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:04,445
Speaker 1: No, you wouldn't have because it depends if those coins all meant something.

99
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:09,053
Speaker 0: Yeah coins mean something Couple do?

100
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,240
Speaker 1: there's one sacajawea in there.

101
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:13,910
Speaker 1: like sacajawea is there's a couple of wheat pennies.

102
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,994
Speaker 1: I really like wheat pennies.

103
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,630
Speaker 1: Like I I don't collect them, but I have a whole bunch of them.

104
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:23,070
Speaker 0: I wonder if that machine is actually gonna work with dollar coins because I got a few in there.

105
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:28,450
Speaker 1: The scary thing is because there might even be a half dollar in there how lazy I am when it comes to my pockets.

106
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:35,130
Speaker 1: So when I get home I basically empty the money contents of my pockets into that thing and it often includes like fives and tens.

107
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,720
Speaker 1: Because you know, I'm in a hurry all the time in the city.

108
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,604
Speaker 1: So I'll get like a bagel.

109
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:40,977
Speaker 1: I'll pay with a 20 I'll get change.

110
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:41,480
Speaker 1: I'm in a hurry.

111
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,930
Speaker 1: So I take the change to throw it in my pocket.

112
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,404
Speaker 1: Then I can help when I throw it in the bin.

113
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:48,245
Speaker 1: So Sometimes I'll be like, ah, I don't want to go to the ATM.

114
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:48,990
Speaker 1: So I open that thing.

115
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,423
Speaker 1: There'll be like three hundred dollars in like bill change in there.

116
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:53,828
Speaker 1: I pull it out and use it.

117
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:54,430
Speaker 1: the thing.

118
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:57,509
Speaker 1: I feel like I've gotten careless with money.

119
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:04,302
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah The only light the only final item of note is the Mets are done.

120
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:04,823
Speaker 0: Yeah.

121
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:05,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are they.

122
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:09,292
Speaker 0: they said they sucked it up which is a Classic.

123
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:13,010
Speaker 0: consider, you know, if you know the Mets it's sort of like sort of poetic.

124
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,660
Speaker 0: It's like how it's supposed to go to.

125
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:16,029
Speaker 0: the thing is totally sucking it up.

126
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:20,515
Speaker 1: There's a difference between the Mets sucking it up where People kind of thought like.

127
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:25,190
Speaker 1: people thought maybe they had a chance but then after they lose in retrospect They're like, yeah, they never had a chance.

128
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:33,090
Speaker 0: The Mets have always been sort of like, you know the bums and then you know They sort of more recently have been trying to be the Yankees of the Red Sox.

129
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:38,152
Speaker 0: You know the teams that spend a million dollars to get good players and win and two years in a row It hasn't worked.

130
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,698
Speaker 1: I much prefer the team.

131
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:45,038
Speaker 1: In fact, it's failed spectacularly to use where the idea of a fairweather fan Could not possibly exist.

132
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:48,699
Speaker 1: I mean, yes, I'm a fan of the Detroit Lions.

133
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:50,655
Speaker 0: They're worse this year than ever.

134
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:54,549
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, you know, they've only been in one playoff game since the late 50s.

135
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,541
Speaker 0: Yes, I realized that I don't think they won that play.

136
00:06:57,581 --> 00:07:01,502
Speaker 1: if the Lions did better than they do now I would not be a fan of them.

137
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,610
Speaker 1: I would only be a fan.

138
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,493
Speaker 1: It's pretty much if they're a great team I'd be like.

139
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:08,406
Speaker 1: I'd be really excited about him because I like having like the Red Wings.

140
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:11,810
Speaker 1: like they're a great team They're always in contention for the Stanley Cup.

141
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:19,302
Speaker 1: They're always like a dangerous team and if they don't win the Stanley Cup every year They always get close and it's always really dangerous when you're playing against them.

142
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:23,390
Speaker 1: and I like that and I also like a team That's like underdog scrappy.

143
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:31,929
Speaker 1: I hate it when a team's just mediocre like they just lose a lot But they don't lose enough to where losing becomes like a thing like yeah, the Lions are playing.

144
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:37,070
Speaker 0: I'm more, you know, I don't like a team that just wins all the time.

145
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:49,717
Speaker 0: But I tell you Giants doing so all right now not not gonna not gonna complain not complaining but if they'll be really I think what you really I think is most important in choosing your team is Sort of like for me.

146
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:51,668
Speaker 0: It's like the history of the team.

147
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:54,469
Speaker 0: Yes Losing I can't get it.

148
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,477
Speaker 0: Well, it has to just be a deep history.

149
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:58,706
Speaker 0: one of those like I can't like like an expansion.

150
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:01,937
Speaker 0: Dean has been around for ten Years, whatever easy story about them.

151
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:05,970
Speaker 0: Like maybe they were founded by God maybe but you know, it's like Mets.

152
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,988
Speaker 0: You know been around for like, you know since the early 60s.

153
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:15,666
Speaker 1: It's pretty old early 60s shah the Red Wings are the oldest continuous hockey franchise in the NHL.

154
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:18,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Rich history there.

155
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,909
Speaker 1: They they used to play in the Coliseum which as my dad would tell me had lots of Christians and Lions was.

156
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,857
Speaker 1: so I see what you did there.

157
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:28,742
Speaker 1: Basically.

158
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:40,488
Speaker 0: It was very tall and The top seats you almost be like leaning over this day were just like these square stone things that It's a really long and round ish kinda.

159
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:44,890
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, they didn't really have ice back there and the Commissioner would give a thumbs up or a thumbs down.

160
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:46,223
Speaker 0: Well, you know, there's no gold judge.

161
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:51,504
Speaker 1: at the time They just basically wasn't hockey so much as they just killed each other.

162
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:52,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, so like that.

163
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,814
Speaker 0: No, isn't that what hockey is?

164
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:54,236
Speaker 0: You know what?

165
00:08:54,377 --> 00:09:07,143
Speaker 1: I gotta say while I prefer modern hockey There's something about watching an old hockey game with those leather skull caps and they basically the goalie is at risk for his life at every second and A lot of goalies got killed.

166
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:12,830
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, just to wrap this wrap up the opening bits and get to the real bits with the hockey, right?

167
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:20,767
Speaker 0: The Rangers are currently in Europe playing some Europe teams before the season starts And they they played a bunch of preseason games before they.

168
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:28,103
Speaker 0: they you know We they they left for Europe if you didn't notice all those people with Rangers jerseys when he went to the YAF Right and calling it the YAF from now on it.

169
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:30,289
Speaker 0: Yeah You're a Canada festival.

170
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:36,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, they lost every preseason game so far and they're playing Detroit once this year in Detroit.

171
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,439
Speaker 1: I know you realize if they go I always miss.

172
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,097
Speaker 1: the time the Red Wings will come to New York and play them is the Time I'm going to pay whatever it takes to be there.

173
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:54,030
Speaker 0: and you've never been to Madison Square Garden anything now the greatest indoor Basketball and hockey facility in the world, but then again, it lacks something very important.

174
00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:00,066
Speaker 1: You see the Joe Louis arena as I am often Likened to say does not have a statue of Joe Louis.

175
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:04,325
Speaker 1: out in the front of it It has a statue a gigantic statue of Joe Louis's fist.

176
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,148
Speaker 0: That's all right.

177
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,353
Speaker 1: It's pro.

178
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,740
Speaker 1: it's possibly the best statue in the world.

179
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:10,346
Speaker 0: Madison Square Garden has.

180
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:11,510
Speaker 1: I like to call it the big O.

181
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:17,729
Speaker 0: Madison Square Garden has a whole train station, but it doesn't have a giant fist.

182
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:21,793
Speaker 0: Well, he can go see some boxing down here and it sometimes Lots of fists.

183
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:25,536
Speaker 0: All right Let's get to the tech.

184
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:36,441
Speaker 1: All right, so, you know, it wasn't that long ago We talked about how Apple apparently hates podcasting and they did that thing where they basically there was an app that did exactly what everyone who has an iPhone wants.

185
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:43,330
Speaker 0: and then Apple said well it did it mostly because it The only problem with it it didn't integrate with the built-in iPod function.

186
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:43,674
Speaker 1: No, but it.

187
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:56,330
Speaker 1: but that's see that's the point Basically, it did the one thing that the iPhone built-in iTunes thing doesn't do Yeah, and then Apple said no you can't have it because it competes with an existing function.

188
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,278
Speaker 1: But obviously that's bullshit.

189
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:01,350
Speaker 0: and I asked the guy who made it and he said he wouldn't get an interview with us.

190
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:02,549
Speaker 0: But then he didn't email me back.

191
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:06,527
Speaker 1: But I thought you know that was crap.

192
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,595
Speaker 1: and you know We had a lot of speculation as to why.

193
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:13,590
Speaker 1: and then a couple other apps like big apps that did similarly important things got rejected.

194
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:24,249
Speaker 1: Meanwhile as someone aptly pointed out on slash dot man I feel like I should just make you know a flashlight app because there's like 50 of those And they all seem to make money.

195
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:27,559
Speaker 0: yeah, this is this is the problem that's going on.

196
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:37,530
Speaker 0: is you have a situation in which Apple has provided this channel and through which You can make a lot of money but because of the way they you know, the channel is closed, right?

197
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:45,710
Speaker 0: People aren't willing to sort of put in a big an investment in making something actually interesting because anything interesting is not allowed.

198
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:53,077
Speaker 0: It's very difficult to make anything interesting because you can't get any help because the NDA and we can't figure out why Apple's making the arbitrary decisions.

199
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:58,029
Speaker 1: they are because they don't have to tell us and they won't tell us Yeah, and it's like you make this big expensive app.

200
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:05,820
Speaker 0: It took you like months to make and lots of money paying developers, you know, and then Apple at the last second could just say Yeah, you know, we're not gonna let you put it on there.

201
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,450
Speaker 0: and then you just wasted all that time and money.

202
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:09,519
Speaker 0: So no one's gonna gamble on it now.

203
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:11,950
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have talked about all the apps or shovelware.

204
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,470
Speaker 1: I mean, it's kind of like my old Jack Thompson thing where I've already talked about the bad thing you did.

205
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:25,229
Speaker 1: You really have to go well beyond that for me to even consider talking about you again Because I only have so many minutes of showtime to talk about tech stuff.

206
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:33,657
Speaker 1: But Apple what like went so far beyond what I would have expected or what I could conduct like It's I can't even like.

207
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:35,790
Speaker 1: the magnitude of this just really irks me.

208
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,210
Speaker 1: But basically Apple got a lot of bad press about these apps that got rejected from the tech community.

209
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:56,182
Speaker 1: so basically what they did is they you know, they got very introspective and said well, obviously what we need to do is cover applications to the iPhone App Store With an NDA so that people can't tell anyone if we rejected their app.

210
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,588
Speaker 1: that way we can't have any bad press.

211
00:12:58,969 --> 00:13:02,973
Speaker 1: No brilliant and evil Totally evil.

212
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:03,916
Speaker 1: think about this.

213
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:11,830
Speaker 1: Apple basically has said that if you submit an app to them and they reject it You cannot say if it got rejected.

214
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,076
Speaker 1: That's it's ludicrous.

215
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:14,779
Speaker 1: It's evil.

216
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,150
Speaker 1: It serves no purpose whatsoever.

217
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:25,698
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna be some lawsuit action except you basically protect Apple from the bad Press that it generated itself by being evil in the first place.

218
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:32,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Like I used to speculate like oh, well, you know, it's hard to say exactly what Apple's motivations are.

219
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,836
Speaker 1: I mean we had a lot of theory.

220
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:40,510
Speaker 0: if they would just open it up Everyone be praising them and they'd be rolling in the bank twice as much as they are now.

221
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,076
Speaker 0: So I don't know why they don't.

222
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:42,437
Speaker 0: here's the.

223
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:43,441
Speaker 0: what is their thinking?

224
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:45,047
Speaker 1: Let's say I was Apple right.

225
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,879
Speaker 1: somehow like I am Apple not Steve Jobs, but I am.

226
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,702
Speaker 1: I'm like the avatar of Apple and I don't want iPod like iPod.

227
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:54,747
Speaker 1: I keep saying iPods.

228
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:58,742
Speaker 1: I don't want podcasts To succeed at all as an example like that.

229
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:00,130
Speaker 1: I just do not want them to succeed.

230
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,710
Speaker 1: I have a lot of reasons whatever doesn't matter what they are.

231
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:12,470
Speaker 1: Instead of doing all this bad PR crap I would have just said something like the reason we rejected this app is because we have something much better in the works.

232
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:26,147
Speaker 1: But the technology is not quite there yet and we're not going to let you the consumer get something subpar wait for the real thing and Then just not give a date and then slowly let that fade and then all the bad press disappears.

233
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:31,010
Speaker 1: and then a year later I get the one angry blog nerd saying Apple lied to me and no one pays attention.

234
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:41,054
Speaker 0: People actually seem to pay attention to that sort of thing, but it wouldn't have generated nearly as much bad Press as rejecting it giving an absolutely fallacious Podcasting either.

235
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:44,494
Speaker 0: there's a whole bunch of apps that are being rejected all over the place And here's the thing right.

236
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:49,172
Speaker 0: a lot of the things they say right will reject your app for this or that Right.

237
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,790
Speaker 0: there are apps out there that do things that are technically against the rules.

238
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:56,540
Speaker 0: Yes, and it's like well, how did that app get it?

239
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,367
Speaker 0: It's breaking the rules, but they say you can't?

240
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:01,024
Speaker 1: you know They don't want duplicate functionality.

241
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:01,689
Speaker 0: There's a good enough.

242
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,737
Speaker 0: There's a famous combination of words.

243
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:07,029
Speaker 0: the famous combination is arbitrary and capricious.

244
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,469
Speaker 1: We've been using those two words a lot lately.

245
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:15,089
Speaker 1: I mean that the word capricious and the word arbitrary when combined are like the thing of the month for us.

246
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:26,990
Speaker 1: Well, they're like husband and wife Abbott and Costello, right but I don't know what else I can say about this other than that, it's Bullshit, and I don't want I can't let it lie.

247
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:32,590
Speaker 1: So Apple the only reason you're allowed to get away with this is because the Android has its own problems.

248
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:35,083
Speaker 0: I saw you talking about this Android phone, right?

249
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:36,310
Speaker 0: We've been waiting for this, right?

250
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,690
Speaker 0: I mean think about this.

251
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,166
Speaker 0: I got the iPhone right and you know what I'm sticking with the iPhone and I'll tell you why.

252
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:45,537
Speaker 0: but I gotta tell you You know, I was when I got the iPhone.

253
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:55,110
Speaker 0: I was thinking well either I get this now or I wait for the Android and seeing That the Android I'm glad that I got the iPhone but both are flawed.

254
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:57,136
Speaker 0: They're just different right iPhone.

255
00:15:57,196 --> 00:16:01,530
Speaker 0: obviously we just discussed problem closed platform evil Apple locking you down.

256
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,501
Speaker 1: But I mean don't forget as much you know, it's down as I am on Apple right now The iPhone is still like one of the best pieces of technology out there.

257
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:07,823
Speaker 1: It's just.

258
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:17,147
Speaker 1: it could be so much more Same as like every piece of technology I ever taught just like wow with a slight modification.

259
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:20,758
Speaker 1: This could be Transcendent, but instead it's simply okay.

260
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:21,200
Speaker 1: Yep.

261
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:21,943
Speaker 0: Yeah.

262
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:23,870
Speaker 0: Okay, so the Android phone finally came out.

263
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,435
Speaker 0: And what is the Android phone?

264
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:26,778
Speaker 0: do that?

265
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,102
Speaker 0: I was hoping from the iPhone.

266
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:30,790
Speaker 0: Well, it's from Google and t-mobile.

267
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:34,722
Speaker 0: So, of course, it works better with the Google stuff than the.

268
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:37,150
Speaker 0: you know, iPhone does but it's t-mobile.

269
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:39,520
Speaker 0: Well, what's wrong with t-mobile?

270
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:41,573
Speaker 1: Their coverage is not great in a lot That's right.

271
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:45,090
Speaker 0: The t-mobile coverage is not so great and their 3g is supposed.

272
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,930
Speaker 1: Oh, wow, when you said what's wrong with t-mobile?

273
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,810
Speaker 1: I thought whatever I said you were gonna argue against me.

274
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,216
Speaker 1: But now t-mobiles coverage sucks.

275
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:53,128
Speaker 0: now t-mobiles coverage is not as good compared to AT&T.

276
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:53,530
Speaker 0: Verizon.

277
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:55,455
Speaker 1: He's not that good either.

278
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:57,683
Speaker 0: AT&T is fine except in beacon.

279
00:16:58,064 --> 00:16:59,389
Speaker 0: Well, no except at our house.

280
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:04,964
Speaker 1: Typically, all right in our house and like this hundred foot radius around our house.

281
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:06,829
Speaker 1: There's like no AT&T coverage, right?

282
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,720
Speaker 1: It's like my Blackberry doesn't work for crap.

283
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:13,601
Speaker 0: Right anyway, but T-mobiles 3g coverage, you know, it's sort of new.

284
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:17,676
Speaker 0: they've got it in 20-something cities I think but it's not that big.

285
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:21,530
Speaker 0: but someone you know, if you're on it, you're like the only one on it.

286
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:27,585
Speaker 0: So it's actually pretty nice because you have this 3g all to yourself if you have it and in the city I'm pretty sure the 3g is there.

287
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,773
Speaker 0: And the other good things about the Android phone, right works Well with the Google.

288
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:36,950
Speaker 0: stuff with the iPhone does not do as well as the Android phone.

289
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,529
Speaker 0: So like my Google Calendar, I still cannot sync with the iPhone, which is pretty bad.

290
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:47,710
Speaker 0: Also, you know, it's open which is you know, the iPhone is closed that the Android is open.

291
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:49,037
Speaker 0: It has a keyboard.

292
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:56,774
Speaker 0: if you're not liking the iPhone touchy keyboard Which I've gotten kind of used to but still even getting used to it, you know I can type on it.

293
00:17:56,895 --> 00:18:00,250
Speaker 0: but say I would you know, if I had to type in like a long complicated password.

294
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:06,450
Speaker 1: It's annoying, you know what I realized like I was holding my Blackberry the other day and like it's weird.

295
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:12,315
Speaker 1: It's like the iPhone and the Blackberry are exactly equal in terms of input in my idea But they both like.

296
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:19,629
Speaker 1: what if I was using an iPhone it'd be great until I wanted to type something and I've used the Blackberry It's great until I want to navigate around something Yep.

297
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:30,750
Speaker 1: But I realized for me personally if I had the iPhone screen on the front and just a QWERTY keyboard on the back I could talk like I could hold it with the screen in front of me and type on the back just touch typing.

298
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,618
Speaker 0: Well, the Android does that it has a slide.

299
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:33,984
Speaker 0: It's a slider with a touchscreen.

300
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:35,410
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's what it is.

301
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,096
Speaker 1: The Android is it could do.

302
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:41,954
Speaker 1: it'd be great for me except for the fact that it has the same level of flaws that the iPhone does right.

303
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:42,397
Speaker 0: so he is.

304
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:45,110
Speaker 0: what's wrong right with the Android phone, right?

305
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,530
Speaker 0: Well, the first problem right is that it's open so you can make anything for it, right?

306
00:18:50,710 --> 00:19:03,958
Speaker 0: But there's a lot of things that aren't made for it yet Like it doesn't have a video playing software you to get a yet to get one from somewhere which is fine for someone like us who knows how to use it, but The interface is really bad.

307
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,250
Speaker 0: The music playing interface is also really bad.

308
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:06,651
Speaker 0: It's just.

309
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,436
Speaker 0: it's like they have all these.

310
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:10,863
Speaker 0: it has functionality, but the interface is lacking.

311
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,328
Speaker 0: It's a lot like the Nokia devices.

312
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:12,869
Speaker 0: then the.

313
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,904
Speaker 0: The functionality of the Nokia devices has this insane insane feature list.

314
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:29,499
Speaker 0: you basically do anything but The interface is bad and on a mobile device bad interface on a feature as far as I'm concerned Effectively makes the feature useless.

315
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:41,213
Speaker 0: because if the inner like I used to have a Blackberry All right, when I worked for the other company that Blackberry had a shit ton of features I only ever used it for the company email Even though I could have used it for other things and I try to use of other things Am I?

316
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:47,922
Speaker 0: even the cell phone I just got rid of has a million features I never used because the interface was so bad and so painful.

317
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:50,090
Speaker 0: It wasn't worth it to use the feature.

318
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,320
Speaker 0: It was more convenient not to use the feature than to use it.

319
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,390
Speaker 0: and that's the Nokia device the Android whatever Android is it?

320
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:02,150
Speaker 0: Okay interface in general, but the specific apps, you know have some problems in that department.

321
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:07,375
Speaker 0: So even though it's a music player if the interface on the music player sucks It's no good.

322
00:20:07,395 --> 00:20:17,290
Speaker 0: And actually it has the Amazon mp3 store built in which is pretty cool You know, no DRM download direct whatnot, but Amazon mp3 store is still overpriced for my taste.

323
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:20,049
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I'd buy a whole lot of music from it and I'd be broke.

324
00:20:21,273 --> 00:20:27,190
Speaker 0: the main problem with the Android phone in the book of Scott is that to plug in some headphones?

325
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,065
Speaker 0: You need to get this little adapter that connects and then the headphones go into that.

326
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:32,330
Speaker 0: It doesn't have a headphone hole.

327
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,347
Speaker 1: We already learned this lesson from Nintendo and Nintendo rectified the situation.

328
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:51,370
Speaker 0: Yes You see the main thing in the iPhone 3g is that it is a iPod Full-on perfect iPod and I need iPod a lot more than I need phone and a phone and an internet device.

329
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:54,670
Speaker 0: And it does all of those things equally well.

330
00:20:55,454 --> 00:21:02,270
Speaker 0: The Android is a phone an internet device But it's media playing interface is such that it's effectively useless.

331
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,708
Speaker 0: Thus if I had the Android phone, I would still need an iPod nano.

332
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:09,680
Speaker 0: I Really really want an open device.

333
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,269
Speaker 0: I really really really want to be able to do any software I want and have all these features like tethering and whatnot.

334
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:25,623
Speaker 0: But the ability to be able to carry one less physical thing on my person on a day-to-day basis Makes such a huge difference in everyday life.

335
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,999
Speaker 0: It's not worth it It's that's how big a deal.

336
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,964
Speaker 0: that is and these companies don't seem to realize that Carrying fewer things is a huge deal.

337
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:40,030
Speaker 0: huge is like I don't have to remember to have a phone and an iPod.

338
00:21:40,472 --> 00:21:42,142
Speaker 0: I only have to carry one thing and you know what?

339
00:21:42,163 --> 00:21:47,384
Speaker 0: I realized if Technology wasn't stupid and ever in the iPhone was fully open.

340
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:48,930
Speaker 0: right everything, right?

341
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:53,715
Speaker 0: I wouldn't need to carry anything but the iPhone Need a while.

342
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,062
Speaker 1: There's one thing I wouldn't need.

343
00:21:55,262 --> 00:21:58,037
Speaker 0: well, I wouldn't need keys to my car I wouldn't need keys to the house.

344
00:21:58,419 --> 00:21:59,868
Speaker 1: one thing you would need what would I need?

345
00:21:59,888 --> 00:22:05,390
Speaker 1: a Camera because the iPhone camera could not have never unless we get some crazy.

346
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,289
Speaker 0: But I wouldn't need to carry on a day-to-day basis.

347
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:14,015
Speaker 1: No, because if you yeah because that's true because if you're gonna take a picture of the hobo with the funny sign You don't need the like 12 Bring.

348
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:15,934
Speaker 0: yeah I'd only bring the good camera.

349
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:17,078
Speaker 0: tell you conventions and whatnot.

350
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:17,801
Speaker 0: when I expected it

351
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:36,106
Speaker 1: at least the one thing that is obviated this desired For salt to some degree for me is the fact that now that I have a really nice bag to carry my laptop in Like the bet the bag is basically my murse now And I always have everything in the world that I need in that murse kind of like how before I had the murse But before I also had a cell phone.

352
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:43,919
Speaker 1: Remember at RIT that trench coat like I once for show that I could carry a full 12 pack of soda Completely concealed inside of that trench coat.

353
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:54,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, I carried everything in the world in that trench coat Mm-hmm, but then at the same time if I had just like and I a little box that did everything I don't think I would have needed the trench coat, right?

354
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:56,865
Speaker 1: But I kind of like wearing the trench coat with all the stuff in the pockets.

355
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:57,690
Speaker 0: you can do that, too.

356
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,742
Speaker 0: But the point is like I also have a bag that I could put everything in.

357
00:23:00,803 --> 00:23:04,034
Speaker 0: but there are some situations where I just want To go pockets only.

358
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:09,930
Speaker 0: and when you're going pockets only it's cool not to have to you know to have just one thing.

359
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:13,810
Speaker 1: See, this is where pockets only where I feel like I would always need two devices.

360
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,070
Speaker 1: I will always need like in the ideal devices what you need.

361
00:23:17,391 --> 00:23:24,331
Speaker 1: I need the super awesome computer device that does everything and is the iPhone and then I need the Rugged.

362
00:23:24,392 --> 00:23:29,190
Speaker 1: take it camping with me when I'm out hiking in the rain device because I doubt I'll ever get the iPhone.

363
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,778
Speaker 0: I mean I get a bowl at the same time.

364
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:33,250
Speaker 1: Oh, no, but I still I will need to own both devices.

365
00:23:33,591 --> 00:23:41,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like I own a laptop that I use for mobile interneting and I own an iPhone which is for mobile interneting There's a cross You know purpose there I guess like.

366
00:23:41,933 --> 00:24:03,084
Speaker 1: in the end though that the killer at like the real killer app the thing that's going to change the world in A big world the techno technological world in a big way is Going to be not just when you have one device that can do like all these things with a good interface But when you have one device that can do these things that is not in any way tethered to any physical other device or physical location at all.

367
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:10,749
Speaker 1: Hmm to where the only time it ever needs to be physically connected to anything is when you need to put more power into it.

368
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:15,090
Speaker 0: Well, even then and so there's some wireless charging technologies, but they're not that efficient.

369
00:24:15,852 --> 00:24:17,237
Speaker 0: They can be because laws of physics.

370
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:23,999
Speaker 1: there's the fundamental problem that the faster you charge something like that the more More energy there is going through the air.

371
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:34,664
Speaker 1: that can cook things right exactly, but there's also the Well, there's also the advances in you know Shaking things to give them more electricity and solar cells and heat transfer all that kind of.

372
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:38,496
Speaker 0: but there's also the the situation in Which you would want to connect it to something else.

373
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:42,990
Speaker 0: For example, I want to connect it to my computer to transfer everything to a back.

374
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:44,535
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

375
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:46,770
Speaker 1: it should be able to connect everything.

376
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:50,130
Speaker 1: I should be I could set it up to where when I'm in my house.

377
00:24:50,597 --> 00:25:01,589
Speaker 1: It uses you know the future Bluetooth the thing that's better than Bluetooth and it automatically just connects to all the computers in my house that I told it to And does whatever business they go sharing and syncing whatever that I wanted to do with them.

378
00:25:02,273 --> 00:25:10,890
Speaker 1: But if I carry it elsewhere, it can still synchronize with things through the wireless Yep, that it'll always synchronize with everything when I'm in the car to update its own firmware.

379
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:17,030
Speaker 1: Yep, when I'm in the car It just automatically knows it's in my car and plays the music and answers the phone through this area.

380
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,967
Speaker 0: This kind of thing we're talking about isn't like some future dream.

381
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:25,681
Speaker 0: This is Technologically possible right now with things that are already invented.

382
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:27,526
Speaker 0: It's just nobody's done it.

383
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:29,190
Speaker 0: It's it's it's done.

384
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,620
Speaker 0: It's like we've invented everything that needs to be invented.

385
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,086
Speaker 0: It's a solved problem.

386
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:35,336
Speaker 0: It's like aha I figured up to get.

387
00:25:35,356 --> 00:25:38,070
Speaker 0: it's like if imagine if no one ever had been to Mount Everest, right?

388
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,257
Speaker 0: No one had ever made it to the top.

389
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:47,550
Speaker 0: a guy figured out how to make it to the top Proved that it would definitely work 100% and then everyone just sat at the bottom of the mountain say I'm not going.

390
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:48,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't feel like going up.

391
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:49,901
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

392
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,067
Speaker 0: We know we can do it, right?

393
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:51,730
Speaker 0: Yes, let's not.

394
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:52,895
Speaker 0: That's what's going on here.

395
00:25:52,915 --> 00:25:54,663
Speaker 0: is we can make this device.

396
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:57,093
Speaker 0: Well, you see no one's done it What no one will.

397
00:25:57,254 --> 00:26:01,610
Speaker 1: one thing is that the problem with any sort of because there are a lot of things like this where?

398
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:23,830
Speaker 1: unified technological advancement or even just unified technological application Could revolutionize industries could revolutionize businesses could revolutionize people's lives but different people have their hands in different parts of the pie and It's kind of a tragedy of the Commons where that one person investing in it will fail and lose money.

399
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:37,509
Speaker 1: You need many people in different industries or different realms to invest simultaneously But then again anytime people do that other groups of people immediately defect and invest in a contrary technology And then everything gets fucked off.

400
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,019
Speaker 0: And there's a thing open source can do it right.

401
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:43,130
Speaker 0: open source is ready to make the software that will make these things happen.

402
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,497
Speaker 0: But the hardware isn't open.

403
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:54,150
Speaker 0: and even when you come with open source Operating system on a piece of hardware the t-mobile g1 doesn't have all the hardware necessary.

404
00:26:54,692 --> 00:26:55,355
Speaker 0: There is still.

405
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,640
Speaker 0: it doesn't have the headphone hole.

406
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,986
Speaker 0: It doesn't have a couple other things.

407
00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:58,910
Speaker 0: It's not perfect.

408
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:08,630
Speaker 0: We need someone to just make the device I mean even look like the Nokia n810 which comes really close and runs Linux doesn't have a phone in it.

409
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:14,570
Speaker 1: Well, we really need more than anything our standards that people actually follow for all sorts of communication and all sorts.

410
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,678
Speaker 1: You know we do.

411
00:27:15,698 --> 00:27:16,785
Speaker 0: we have a lot of standards.

412
00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:17,450
Speaker 1: There's the problem.

413
00:27:17,591 --> 00:27:32,570
Speaker 1: we have a lot of standards that are all very purpose-specific and very useless outside of very specific realms and very limited because of different companies trying to push different formats and Also the fact that they just people don't write software to take advantage of it.

414
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,054
Speaker 1: I mean My iPhone.

415
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:41,370
Speaker 1: like there aren't that many car stereos to where I can just have my iPhone in my car and just play the music Bluetooth automatically without thinking about yeah, I mean that's totally possible.

416
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,674
Speaker 0: You could have a head.

417
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:45,542
Speaker 0: you know a head unit your car stereo could be Bluetooth.

418
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,987
Speaker 0: well the iPhone does.

419
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:54,490
Speaker 0: another example the iPhone Could right give you stereo audio over Bluetooth, but they didn't put the a2dp profile on it.

420
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,200
Speaker 0: So it can't know why.

421
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:57,689
Speaker 1: oh we can't know we don't know.

422
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:10,030
Speaker 0: But if they did put the a2dp profile on the iPhone 3g or the regular iPhone you could listen to stereo audio With wireless headphones all right, and if they did that right you could have a car stereo head unit.

423
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,351
Speaker 0: Why?

424
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:24,690
Speaker 0: I don't think there are any car stereo head units and none that I've seen that have a2dp so that any device With stereo audio Bluetooth right could send it stereo audio Bluetooth to the car head unit And then it would come out of your car speakers with no wires and no nothing.

425
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,562
Speaker 0: There's no reason that that can't be but no one's made one.

426
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,229
Speaker 0: I don't know why not.

427
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:50,325
Speaker 1: oh But anyway things of the day, so uh I discovered Possibly the first example of a riced out car in the history of cars History of motor cars right?

428
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:53,194
Speaker 0: you're not looking at like some pimped-out chariots are you?

429
00:28:53,495 --> 00:28:56,966
Speaker 1: I'm sure there were some pimped-out chariots Pimped-out horse and carriage.

430
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:58,271
Speaker 1: there's this gallery here.

431
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,660
Speaker 0: I would have a pimped-out horse modified.

432
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:01,966
Speaker 0: You know why.

433
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,614
Speaker 0: you know why I pimp out my horse and carriage.

434
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:04,980
Speaker 0: why scare off Robin Hood?

435
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:06,891
Speaker 0: You know I was too cool.

436
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,516
Speaker 0: He wouldn't rob me.

437
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:10,857
Speaker 1: Anyway, I think my bread jokes are better than that.

438
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:11,260
Speaker 0: whatever.

439
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:12,783
Speaker 1: Right here.

440
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:14,008
Speaker 1: I'm gonna link to this.

441
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:29,700
Speaker 1: This is the fourth picture in a series of nine pictures of Interesting modifications and applications of the Model T. You know the first mass-produced real car and Basically because the car was so simple like the whole body was just this metal kind of shell.

442
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:32,080
Speaker 1: You just pop it right off pop something else on there.

443
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:35,191
Speaker 0: I don't know how many people have looked in a Model T.

444
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:36,476
Speaker 1: I've driven one.

445
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:37,520
Speaker 1: I've ridden in one.

446
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:38,447
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at it.

447
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:40,120
Speaker 0: look open up the hood of a new car.

448
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,725
Speaker 0: There's a lot of shit in there right.

449
00:29:41,825 --> 00:29:44,233
Speaker 0: most of that shit is like air conditioning.

450
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,540
Speaker 0: You know really complicated transmission.

451
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:49,209
Speaker 0: You know alternators and things right.

452
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:51,256
Speaker 0: the Model T right.

453
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:52,299
Speaker 0: open that bitch up.

454
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,730
Speaker 1: I'll explain it in layman terms a bully and a motor?

455
00:29:56,971 --> 00:30:05,717
Speaker 1: not even it looks like a little motor and a rubber band connected to a shaft which connects to the axle pretty much directly and it's.

456
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:07,724
Speaker 1: it's a Beautiful thing to behold.

457
00:30:07,825 --> 00:30:08,849
Speaker 1: and it was actually.

458
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,897
Speaker 1: it drives a lot better than you'd think.

459
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,168
Speaker 0: yeah I mean you know it takes.

460
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:13,469
Speaker 0: it's.

461
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:15,800
Speaker 0: it's one of those things where you get diminishing returns.

462
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,632
Speaker 0: You know it's sort of like the space shuttle where it's like okay a big rocket.

463
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:27,318
Speaker 0: Just plain old rocket gonna get you into space 75% of the way right plain old rocket, okay, we need to get into space 99 percent.

464
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,420
Speaker 0: Well, then suddenly it gets much more complicated.

465
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:45,280
Speaker 0: You know as you as you get higher and higher in the percentages to get from 75 percent to 80 percent doesn't take much It takes some wheelings, but to get from 99 percent to ninety nine point five percent Takes like this incredibly complicated computer system with a million things all over the place.

466
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:49,231
Speaker 1: But anyway back in the early Model T days

467
00:30:49,392 --> 00:30:50,575
Speaker 0: you mean early 1900s

468
00:30:50,755 --> 00:30:51,618
Speaker 1: there were companies

469
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:52,380
Speaker 0: in the industrial

470
00:30:53,109 --> 00:31:06,960
Speaker 1: that would make Race car looking bodies slick looking for like you know metal frames metal bodies And you buy them and pop them on you basically kind of like how you change the face plate on your fancy cell phone.

471
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:14,440
Speaker 1: You just swap out the body on your car And now you have a hip looking roadster because and punk kids would buy these things and have a little roadster.

472
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:20,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I think about Model T. Didn't really have a suspension right as That kind of whalebone business.

473
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:23,800
Speaker 0: right right, but I mean you could just take the body off.

474
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,145
Speaker 0: You know the little roof and that little.

475
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:26,571
Speaker 0: you know the seats and whatnot.

476
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:28,720
Speaker 0: and just it was just two axles in the motor.

477
00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:30,834
Speaker 0: Just put something else on top real easy.

478
00:31:30,915 --> 00:31:31,459
Speaker 0: I could do it.

479
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,640
Speaker 0: You don't need you don't need to go to mechanic school or anything.

480
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:38,277
Speaker 0: I wonder how mechanics made money back in those days and anyone can fix their own car.

481
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:38,980
Speaker 1: just people couldn't.

482
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:52,732
Speaker 1: But anyway all I want to point out is that in the spirit of one of my favorite websites ever I'm even making the face right here at the monitor man.

483
00:31:52,853 --> 00:31:54,680
Speaker 0: I wish there was a race like an actual race.

484
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,770
Speaker 0: We're just all cars like that There were back then.

485
00:31:58,851 --> 00:31:59,736
Speaker 0: no no Model T.

486
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:01,384
Speaker 1: Specifically There were.

487
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:03,712
Speaker 1: I'm sure there were local league kind of like out in Canada.

488
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:09,171
Speaker 1: yet like the local boxing league the local hockey league I'm sure there was the local riced out Model T.

489
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:11,760
Speaker 0: I want to see a Model T race right now today.

490
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:16,334
Speaker 1: Anyway, what do you got for me captain thing of the day?

491
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:17,400
Speaker 0: This is all over the news.

492
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,387
Speaker 0: It's not that exciting, but I didn't have anything else.

493
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:20,370
Speaker 0: basically this dude.

494
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,297
Speaker 0: He took a bunch of solenoids.

495
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:25,468
Speaker 0: solenoids Oh, no, oh man solenoids of the wind.

496
00:32:25,488 --> 00:32:27,114
Speaker 0: I don't know if people learn about solenoids.

497
00:32:27,174 --> 00:32:34,720
Speaker 1: I don't think you understand how Pivotal and how kind like my middle school and high school life revolved around solenoids.

498
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:42,611
Speaker 1: And I would say like a good 10% of the stories I have from high school Were caused directly by the intervention of a solenoid.

499
00:32:42,631 --> 00:32:44,016
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean solenoids.

500
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:46,568
Speaker 0: if you don't know about them You should learn how they work.

501
00:32:46,608 --> 00:32:47,774
Speaker 0: It's pretty simple.

502
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:48,639
Speaker 0: You don't have to know that.

503
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:53,007
Speaker 0: much I like to pretty much know is how a magnet works And how an electromagnet.

504
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:55,980
Speaker 1: we made one out of glass that then shattered and hurt someone.

505
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:58,939
Speaker 0: The best is using it to like get rods like hover in the air.

506
00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:03,898
Speaker 1: Oh, we used one to make a lock that could lock a door, and then we couldn't unlock it.

507
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:06,559
Speaker 1: We we made a rail gun.

508
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,426
Speaker 0: That's what are you supposed to do?

509
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,339
Speaker 1: that's pretty much the second thing you do after you learn what a solenoid is.

510
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:18,954
Speaker 0: This guy made a bunch of solenoids I don't know he might have bought them I can't tell and he hooked him up to a computer the control system and whatnot and he had.

511
00:33:19,015 --> 00:33:28,937
Speaker 0: he had each solenoid hitting something different which makes you know a noise and He made a solenoid symphony, and it's a. it's got a funky beat to it.

512
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:29,098
Speaker 0: It's

513
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:29,580
Speaker 1: pretty cool

514
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:31,151
Speaker 0: and it's just a little video here and I

515
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:43,572
Speaker 1: can say this the best or the best thing that ever happened to me in middle school is when we got a hold of a solenoid from an old car and Once we got a 12-volt power supply to it.

516
00:33:43,993 --> 00:33:46,040
Speaker 1: Let me tell you that thing was called the finger breaker.

517
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:49,971
Speaker 1: That's what it is because it broke someone's finger immediately.

518
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,618
Speaker 0: It was that a solenoid for like the car door locks.

519
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:58,780
Speaker 1: Yes Oh, yeah, those basically was ripped out of an old car and we applied 12 volts to it and someone stupid got hurt.

520
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:01,737
Speaker 0: I see I do is you go to the junkyard and you pick those things up real easy.

521
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,784
Speaker 1: actually They're really easy to make two kids.

522
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:12,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's look, you know TI-80x was so important in.

523
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:19,572
Speaker 1: you know, becoming the kind of technological hackers that we are today I feel like solenoids are like number five or six on the list.

524
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:21,598
Speaker 0: You know, you can control solenoids of the TI-80x.

525
00:34:22,822 --> 00:34:24,889
Speaker 1: Yes, actually you could also kids.

526
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:32,110
Speaker 1: you can make a solenoid at home in about an hour Even less depend on it making it from scratch.

527
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,460
Speaker 1: I mean think about it Scott wine wine wine wine wine wine wine.

528
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,045
Speaker 0: You don't have an automatic winder.

529
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,679
Speaker 1: Well, I made an automatic winder out of a screwdriver.

530
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:41,324
Speaker 0: You know what?

531
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:43,375
Speaker 1: I make an automatic winder out of what you make it out of.

532
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:46,590
Speaker 0: well, you know If you go, I don't know how people know about these things.

533
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,239
Speaker 0: It's basically sort of a. they have this thing.

534
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,356
Speaker 0: It's a combination Apple core and slicer and peeler.

535
00:34:52,577 --> 00:34:54,063
Speaker 1: Oh, man I love those things.

536
00:34:54,163 --> 00:35:02,220
Speaker 0: and you may see stick an apple on these spikes and then you spin it and the Apple gets pushed through All these metal things and one metal thing skins the Apple.

537
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:07,240
Speaker 0: Another metal thing takes the core out of the Apple and also cuts the Apple and it's like a thin spiral.

538
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,017
Speaker 1: Stuff like that is really gimmicky, but these things are awesome.

539
00:35:10,097 --> 00:35:10,540
Speaker 0: early works.

540
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,090
Speaker 0: it's suction cups to the table and everything and you can use it to.

541
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:21,440
Speaker 0: you know, make apple cake or pie or whatever right and You can just put your tube on that and then hold, you know your wire and spin away.

542
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:22,988
Speaker 1: No, there's a much better way.

543
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:25,179
Speaker 1: You just take a drill press.

544
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:31,654
Speaker 0: I got an idea to get a Model T and put it to tube and hold the wires Right.

545
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,279
Speaker 1: So it's a buzzword.

546
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:35,784
Speaker 1: It's a big buzzword.

547
00:35:35,824 --> 00:35:40,920
Speaker 1: now people are talking about it lately a lot and we're not gonna talk about what it is.

548
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,040
Speaker 1: We're not gonna go into the tech a little bit.

549
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:45,458
Speaker 1: I don't think we should at all because that's not the interesting part.

550
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:48,698
Speaker 0: and Go I kind of want to talk about some interesting histories there a little bit.

551
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:57,678
Speaker 1: Google I think we should talk about the history is more from our Perspective because these things came and went and came and went in the cycle and we lived through a couple of those cycles.

552
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:58,240
Speaker 0: Yep

553
00:35:58,943 --> 00:36:07,760
Speaker 1: And also if you want the actual history of this or the definite, you know, all that business Google it and you know, if we tell it to you, it'll basically I'll saying well

554
00:36:07,941 --> 00:36:13,720
Speaker 0: I think part of it is that there's been varying definitions over time and That's sort of what's important about it.

555
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,778
Speaker 1: I think the only important thing is that cloud computing is not a new thing at all.

556
00:36:18,898 --> 00:36:21,548
Speaker 1: No, no It's just a new word for that thing.

557
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:22,211
Speaker 1: It's like the.

558
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:26,738
Speaker 1: it's kind of like if we made up a buzzword called I don't know the Phlebo.

559
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:31,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, well basically the deal is right as a flange.

560
00:36:31,134 --> 00:36:32,820
Speaker 1: and read what's this NASA flange?

561
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,858
Speaker 1: What if you could have like what's a summer flange?

562
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,678
Speaker 1: The fuck's a summer flange.

563
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:40,451
Speaker 0: Anyway, the thing is over.

564
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:50,025
Speaker 0: the course of computing history There's been sort of like this cycle right and the cycle has gone back and forth between Centralized and distributed computing.

565
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:50,808
Speaker 0: back and forth.

566
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:54,600
Speaker 0: right at beginning computers are big filled up a whole room, right?

567
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:57,128
Speaker 0: What if one more than one person want to use it at once?

568
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,212
Speaker 0: not easy.

569
00:36:58,272 --> 00:37:07,480
Speaker 0: so they had you know one machine and had multiple Terminals so that you know a bunch of people shared is one computer and it was you know centralized computing.

570
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,590
Speaker 0: There's one CPU a whole bunch of people.

571
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:09,971
Speaker 0: right.

572
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:15,140
Speaker 1: then when personal PCs came around You could start to have that level of power on an individual desk.

573
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,940
Speaker 1: So individual people got control, but then that wasn't enough because you had more power from Maine.

574
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,527
Speaker 1: I mean basically the reason I kind of want to skip talking about all the technological in the history Is that a long time ago?

575
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:35,943
Speaker 1: We kind of decided that we wanted to turn the Monday show into commentary and just talking about tech at our level as opposed to always doing these shows or we kind of Explained if

576
00:37:35,984 --> 00:37:39,320
Speaker 0: we talk about this at our level the show is gonna be over and done with in two seconds.

577
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:43,278
Speaker 1: Not really because I. we have a lot of opinions and commentary and anecdotes.

578
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:43,660
Speaker 0: I don't know.

579
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,171
Speaker 0: It's a pretty simple pro and con.

580
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:58,299
Speaker 1: I think I was so Against the idea of cloud computing back in the day like in the I don't know 1994 through 1999 Cloud computing scared the shit out of me.

581
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,009
Speaker 0: Well, the idea back then right was that you would get a computer that was an almost nothing computer Didn't even have a hard drive almost right?

582
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:07,160
Speaker 0: It was basically the most minimal computer.

583
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,675
Speaker 0: It would be stupidly cheap like a hundred bucks in the which in those days was insane.

584
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:12,739
Speaker 0: It's still kind of insane.

585
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:19,039
Speaker 0: No, I guess you know, I guess a computer that 1990s computer nowadays would be a hundred bucks, but a new computer, right?

586
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:55,959
Speaker 0: And basically, you turn the computer on it would dial up because dial-up is what they had in those days and Everything the computer did would come over the phone line all the software everything and then you wouldn't need to install your operating system update your software anything and all your data would be stored online and everything and that was the idea back then was benefit, right You don't have to worry about hard drives crashing You always have up-to-date software and your computer is really cheap Which was a big deal in those days when even shitty computers are expensive and the cons were Well people, you know sort of underestimated the slowness and shittiness of dial-up

587
00:38:56,272 --> 00:38:56,357
Speaker 1: well

588
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,404
Speaker 0: and it didn't work.

589
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:03,719
Speaker 1: the real issue was that that was in kind of the early part of the big battle over like internet censorship.

590
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:17,440
Speaker 1: and you know before the D the DMC and all this stuff is kind of people were fighting tooth and nail between the forces of Controlling computing resources from central authorities and having the power to do what you want with your technology.

591
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,300
Speaker 1: And this was back when companies like real media and Oracle.

592
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:29,085
Speaker 1: We're basically saying we need to control how people use technology or else It's all gonna go to hell.

593
00:39:29,788 --> 00:39:30,210
Speaker 1: and there were.

594
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:44,963
Speaker 1: there was a big fair among a lot of technologists I know especially a lot of punk kid technologists who were big into piracy and copyright infringement That like digital DRM and all these things would become come to be like the moment they take away our Hardware.

595
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:45,325
Speaker 1: the moment.

596
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,056
Speaker 1: I don't have control over my hardware.

597
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:56,194
Speaker 1: the moment I have to rely on someone else's hardware out there is when the internet dies and the freedom to exchange information dies and Cootie old men control everything.

598
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:56,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, think about it.

599
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,215
Speaker 0: If all if your computer just got everything over the wire from someone from say Google, right?

600
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:02,560
Speaker 0: Well, how does it work?

601
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,740
Speaker 0: You're basically turn on your computer and you're at google.com.

602
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:09,961
Speaker 0: Okay, I want to buy I want to use office, okay, well Google Docs is right there All right.

603
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,324
Speaker 0: I want to play.

604
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:12,628
Speaker 0: I don't know Bioshock.

605
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:15,355
Speaker 0: Okay, double click here pay 50 bucks.

606
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:17,100
Speaker 0: Now you can play Bioshock.

607
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,393
Speaker 0: Congratulations, you know, you can't install anything.

608
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,120
Speaker 0: There's no control by you.

609
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:28,795
Speaker 0: You're pretty much it's no different than using the iPhone today Which is pretty much exactly the same as using the iPhone today.

610
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:29,900
Speaker 1: I'm trying to search for it.

611
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,004
Speaker 1: I can't find it offhand but Some like it.

612
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:38,787
Speaker 1: back then someone made a post on slashdot that has stuck with me to this day And it was basically one of those.

613
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:40,896
Speaker 1: it was much like the famous.

614
00:40:41,237 --> 00:40:41,800
Speaker 1: Do you hear me?

615
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,226
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna take it anymore.

616
00:40:43,286 --> 00:40:55,035
Speaker 1: speech from that movie and it was a guy basically saying that you know you try to you control this and you take this away and They control this media of communication and then they control this one and they're never going to stop.

617
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:56,580
Speaker 1: and we always move on to.

618
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,440
Speaker 1: You know, we move on to ad-hoc computing we move on to wireless.

619
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:02,544
Speaker 1: If you keep taking it away We'll keep moving on.

620
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:07,721
Speaker 1: if we have to we'll use mirrors and we'll reflect light through the air in a way that you can't stop Us.

621
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:08,423
Speaker 1: do you hear me?

622
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:09,326
Speaker 1: Do you fucking hear me?

623
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:13,461
Speaker 1: You can't take away our right to communicate and we will always find a way around It.

624
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,811
Speaker 1: do you fucking understand what it is that we do?

625
00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:17,579
Speaker 1: We are hackers and we will fuck you.

626
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:27,239
Speaker 1: Yep, and that was like the rallying call of the internet and to me that back then and I was really afraid of you know Cloud computing even though no one called it that back then.

627
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,080
Speaker 0: Well, some people did but most people just called it like, you know thin clients, you know net computers that sort of thing.

628
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:49,763
Speaker 1: but then you know Rob down came around and basically cloud computing didn't matter to me in college because we had this crazy network and Instead of cloud computing where I'd rely on someone else It was more like my computer was accessible to me from anywhere I went.

629
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:55,439
Speaker 1: so I just had a Samba share and wherever I went all over campus I could just go to my computer and get all my crap.

630
00:41:55,924 --> 00:42:03,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you weren't going around the world We were just going around this campus and the campus had this incredible network right that covered the entire place.

631
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:10,620
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like, you know, if you made the ghost in the shell world But in this tiny place and you never left the tiny place.

632
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,695
Speaker 0: It was like living in the ghost back then and you had one computer.

633
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:18,160
Speaker 0: That was like your your Powerhouse that was connected to the network.

634
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,020
Speaker 0: So as long as you stayed in the world You you basically had cloud computing even though your cloud was completely controlled by you.

635
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:27,318
Speaker 1: And when I went out of the world, I didn't have any way.

636
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:30,593
Speaker 1: I mean None of us had cell phones like my cell phone.

637
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:33,026
Speaker 0: I couldn't it's not freshman year Yeah, I couldn't know it had.

638
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:36,284
Speaker 0: no one had a cell phone that did anything but make calls But until later.

639
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:39,500
Speaker 1: but like I couldn't afford my old brick cell phone anymore.

640
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:41,168
Speaker 1: None of us had cell phones and none of us.

641
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:49,760
Speaker 1: we had one car and like the entire front row crew So we couldn't even leave the campus let alone try to access media at least for the first couple years.

642
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:53,960
Speaker 1: But even then eventually we didn't have access to internet outside.

643
00:42:55,001 --> 00:43:04,420
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean even if I went home, you know, I could SSH I guess but you know There wasn't like it wasn't like I'm walking around the street or I'm using computers all over the place.

644
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:17,744
Speaker 1: But I really got to say it was like the idea of cloud computing as something that is viable and useful to me Really didn't come to be until Google Made it happen.

645
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:23,740
Speaker 0: Well, what's happened is people were using, you know, people were mostly computing locally right for pretty much everything.

646
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,299
Speaker 1: I mean remember when you like the the classic I'm Installing my computer and what did you do?

647
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:39,107
Speaker 1: You got all your drivers or you know, whatever and you installed all your stuff and then you went around installing like the 30 Applications and games that you used.

648
00:43:39,388 --> 00:43:46,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, and in those times, you know, there are websites but websites were mostly getting information Commenting that sort of thing and there was webmail.

649
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:59,420
Speaker 0: but webmail was basically the thing, you know Connected to the same exact email account as you connected to with say your outlook or your Thunderbird and what you would do is on Your computer you would use your Thunderbird and be so nice.

650
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:00,965
Speaker 0: But if you were somewhere

651
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:03,934
Speaker 1: else Thunderbird back then most people just use Outlook Express

652
00:44:04,014 --> 00:44:06,824
Speaker 0: that I didn't use that but or Eudora Whatever, but well, you

653
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:15,760
Speaker 1: know what I use because before then I use my geo savings account 3 and I use like Outlook Express something I had some other ways there was

654
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,140
Speaker 0: Thunderbird or Mozilla mail or whatever it was at the time.

655
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:27,973
Speaker 1: But back then like the internet was ghettoized basically if you had an email address from any of the places you could get email like An ISP you were pretty much a second-class citizen.

656
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:32,890
Speaker 1: everyone real on the internet Had like basically a dot edu somewhere.

657
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:35,960
Speaker 0: or they had their own domain or their own mail server.

658
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:46,998
Speaker 0: But you would use when you wanted to read your email or something like that You would use an email Application that talked to your mail server with pop through your IMAP and you controlled the email server.

659
00:44:47,078 --> 00:44:47,680
Speaker 0: or were you know?

660
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,539
Speaker 0: Pretty close to it.

661
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:54,002
Speaker 1: I remember most people like we would use pop 3 like I would pop my email down to my own Computer.

662
00:44:54,063 --> 00:44:56,575
Speaker 1: that was like it would physically be there and it wouldn't be anywhere else.

663
00:44:56,655 --> 00:45:00,840
Speaker 0: even if your ISP What went away you still had all your emails on your computer?

664
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:07,499
Speaker 0: And I think usually deleted the emails from the ISP after you downloaded them because no one we didn't trust our ISPs.

665
00:45:08,562 --> 00:45:14,547
Speaker 0: And the only time you would use web mail or something like that is if you really needed to check your email when you weren't Around and web mail sucked.

666
00:45:14,608 --> 00:45:16,017
Speaker 0: It was like squirrel mail or something.

667
00:45:16,037 --> 00:45:18,699
Speaker 1: Oh my god It was painful to use like even RIT.

668
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:29,600
Speaker 1: Right when I was at RIT if I wanted to check my email and I wasn't on campus like I went home for break I would like SSH back to our IT to like the VAX cluster.

669
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:31,468
Speaker 1: And well, actually I use the via the.

670
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:32,634
Speaker 1: I use the.

671
00:45:32,674 --> 00:45:34,000
Speaker 1: what I think is the HP machine.

672
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:35,973
Speaker 1: Whatever there's the VMS.

673
00:45:35,993 --> 00:45:37,022
Speaker 1: There's some other one They were like.

674
00:45:37,123 --> 00:45:45,659
Speaker 1: anyway, I would basically SSH back to our IT Telnet into the port that was my email on the special Unix server and then I'd run elm.

675
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,444
Speaker 0: I used mutt.

676
00:45:47,624 --> 00:45:48,508
Speaker 0: cuz I'm not an idiot.

677
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,940
Speaker 1: I used elm because it did the job, right?

678
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:59,054
Speaker 0: The reason you realize that elm was so bad that they made pine which yes Which is not elm and then mutt was even better than that pine is not elm.

679
00:45:59,415 --> 00:45:59,596
Speaker 0: Yeah.

680
00:45:59,636 --> 00:46:03,863
Speaker 1: Yeah all that business Yeah, but even then it wasn't the cloud it was more like.

681
00:46:04,204 --> 00:46:05,088
Speaker 1: I trusted our like.

682
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,293
Speaker 1: I feel like the.

683
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:11,220
Speaker 1: the core of it is Trust one that the resource will be there in the future.

684
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:13,989
Speaker 1: Trust two that you'll be able to access it from anywhere.

685
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,219
Speaker 1: and trust three that the resource will not unduly control you.

686
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:22,078
Speaker 1: and Basically, I never trusted anyone on the internet whereas you shouldn't have in the 90s.

687
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,904
Speaker 1: You shouldn't trust anyone the internet ever.

688
00:46:24,065 --> 00:46:30,768
Speaker 1: but back then like the internet was such a wild west that like I did not trust anyone Ever for crap on the internet.

689
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:33,140
Speaker 1: and at RIT, I didn't trust the internet.

690
00:46:33,562 --> 00:46:36,316
Speaker 1: I trusted RIT because I was paying them a lot of money.

691
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,364
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, I'm all.

692
00:46:38,425 --> 00:46:41,440
Speaker 0: I trusted the CS department more than I trusted the other RIT night.

693
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,308
Speaker 0: It was like this separate network within the network.

694
00:46:43,449 --> 00:46:43,690
Speaker 0: Yes.

695
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,080
Speaker 1: Also the IT department also had a separate network.

696
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:49,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, then basically the rest of the campus was kind of also a while.

697
00:46:49,734 --> 00:46:51,060
Speaker 0: I still have an account on that CS network.

698
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:51,725
Speaker 0: They haven't deleted it.

699
00:46:52,047 --> 00:46:54,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have an alumni IT account.

700
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,988
Speaker 1: I could have paid for my email, but I didn't bother.

701
00:46:56,029 --> 00:47:01,880
Speaker 0: I mean like my regular RIT account is totally gone You know, but the the account I had in the CS department is still there.

702
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,580
Speaker 0: I can still SSH and use their computers.

703
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,146
Speaker 0: Well, I can still they didn't change it.

704
00:47:05,206 --> 00:47:08,980
Speaker 1: I can still tell that in and get to my financial aid information.

705
00:47:09,801 --> 00:47:10,745
Speaker 0: Oh, I can't do that.

706
00:47:10,946 --> 00:47:14,060
Speaker 1: I can go in there because I did something with it like a year ago.

707
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,875
Speaker 1: I don't know if I still can but But but look at this.

708
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:35,939
Speaker 1: Google got to the point where I may not trust them with my data a hundred percent Necessarily, but I trust that my data is accessible - and I trust that I can get to it to the point that I've basically Started to use Google for just about everything I do.

709
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:36,601
Speaker 0: Well, what?

710
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:43,220
Speaker 0: what they've done to make you know to I guess here is that the number one they've actually made something reliable.

711
00:47:43,621 --> 00:47:49,120
Speaker 0: They've made a web user interface that is as good or actually better than the desktop interfaces.

712
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:54,120
Speaker 0: Right not having to install or upgrade or maintain the software saves you work.

713
00:47:54,902 --> 00:47:58,934
Speaker 1: I've gotten to the point where for the majority of things that I do on any computer.

714
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:02,425
Speaker 1: I'm not just OS agnostic I'm not just platform agnostic.

715
00:48:02,807 --> 00:48:04,151
Speaker 1: I am computer agnostic.

716
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:12,260
Speaker 1: Like it doesn't matter what computer I'm on I can access 90% of the things long as it has an unfiltered internet connection and a web browser.

717
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:14,280
Speaker 0: I'm like, it's like I'm at home.

718
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:14,983
Speaker 0: It used to be.

719
00:48:15,304 --> 00:48:24,259
Speaker 0: you'd use your computer your personal computer and you'd feel at home But if used any other computer it was sort of like a terrible experience because it wasn't customized for you.

720
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:31,260
Speaker 0: Yes Now you can use any internet connected device with a browser that's not filtered and it's like you're at home.

721
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,913
Speaker 1: This is actually a really kind of interesting revelation.

722
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:42,024
Speaker 1: I had many years ago but For most of my life it used to be that I'd go out into the world and I'd enjoy myself and I'd work and I'd go To school.

723
00:48:42,105 --> 00:48:43,419
Speaker 1: I would do things in the world.

724
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:49,200
Speaker 1: But whenever I was out in the world, I was disconnected from the other world the internet.

725
00:48:49,682 --> 00:49:03,060
Speaker 1: So I kind of would always have this sense of coming home like whenever I return to my home base be it my parents house or my Apartment or my dorm room or my house or wherever I would like my home base.

726
00:49:03,662 --> 00:49:05,149
Speaker 1: It was like I came home.

727
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:06,534
Speaker 1: and what did I do when I came home?

728
00:49:07,057 --> 00:49:08,664
Speaker 1: I took off my shoes I hung up my coat.

729
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:14,900
Speaker 1: I would then go and check my messages Like it was like alright, I am home.

730
00:49:15,402 --> 00:49:20,100
Speaker 1: I can now get all the messages all the things that I could not get when I was out in the world.

731
00:49:20,402 --> 00:49:30,448
Speaker 1: I would go to my answering machine and listen to the messages I'll go to my computer read my email then I would go to like my forums read my forums Read the internet and then it like.

732
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:35,630
Speaker 1: it really made this sense of homecoming not just to my home But to my other world.

733
00:49:36,234 --> 00:49:41,400
Speaker 1: and then at RIT That was kind of shattered a little bit because we had an answering machine.

734
00:49:42,084 --> 00:49:44,380
Speaker 1: No one ever called that phone number except spammers.

735
00:49:44,923 --> 00:49:45,789
Speaker 1: So we basically ignored it.

736
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:47,360
Speaker 1: the answering machine was just there because it was free.

737
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,200
Speaker 1: We owned it and then you know, eventually I got a cell phone and I just carried that with me.

738
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,376
Speaker 1: So now getting home like I didn't care about my messages because my messages were with me anywhere.

739
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:01,280
Speaker 1: and then you know I could check my email anywhere on campus.

740
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:04,520
Speaker 1: So coming home was kind of uptime to check the internet in my email.

741
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,994
Speaker 1: But home was now RIT as opposed to just my put my apartment.

742
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,000
Speaker 1: but then I moved to the mountains.

743
00:50:11,623 --> 00:50:18,940
Speaker 1: I did not have internet access my cell phone didn't even work Like I couldn't even use my cell phone where I lived and I didn't pay for a landline.

744
00:50:19,503 --> 00:50:25,406
Speaker 1: I had no possible means of communication with the outside world and My sense of homecoming disappeared.

745
00:50:25,747 --> 00:50:27,633
Speaker 1: and I became really disconnected from the world.

746
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,640
Speaker 1: and I eventually had two homes.

747
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,759
Speaker 1: I had my internet home, which was work.

748
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:43,580
Speaker 1: I would often go to work on the weekend for like an hour to use the internet and I would be home But then I would go home to my house and I'd be home But not really because I was disconnected from all the things that I really needed.

749
00:50:44,582 --> 00:50:56,560
Speaker 1: fast forward because of all these revelations I realized that my Intellectual home like my my kind of connected to the world home has absolutely no physical location whatsoever anymore.

750
00:50:57,021 --> 00:51:02,520
Speaker 1: Now wherever I am I can get online and access 90 to 95 percent of everything I need.

751
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:09,898
Speaker 0: Yep, now the only thing here right is that lately there's been sort of a a bigger push for cloud computing.

752
00:51:09,918 --> 00:51:15,978
Speaker 0: yet again You know into where you know, they're trying to ask you to do more and more of your stuff online.

753
00:51:16,078 --> 00:51:16,640
Speaker 1: Who's they?

754
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:33,812
Speaker 0: Well, you got like, you know Google and Microsoft and Adobe's trying to do like some online stuff You know where instead of buying a piece of software installing it and running it locally you just use someone else's software through the web or through some other mechanism and Things are saved on their servers.

755
00:51:33,912 --> 00:51:35,280
Speaker 1: and then now here's the thing.

756
00:51:35,662 --> 00:51:43,533
Speaker 1: I say 95% because I use the cloud for the 95% of those things But there's always going to be that 5% where I don't try.

757
00:51:43,593 --> 00:51:48,111
Speaker 1: basically it comes down to trust in the end Not even performance because the old argument used to be.

758
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:52,879
Speaker 1: you can never have good performance But technology is going to make that go away.

759
00:51:53,422 --> 00:51:56,740
Speaker 1: You will eventually be able to have good performance in the cloud for anything.

760
00:51:58,062 --> 00:52:07,760
Speaker 1: the only issue that will always remain is trust and I don't think I will ever trust anyone in the world other than Myself to manage that last 5% of my information.

761
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,448
Speaker 1: I mean our podcast, you know our radio show.

762
00:52:10,749 --> 00:52:13,296
Speaker 1: my personal documents that like really matter.

763
00:52:13,316 --> 00:52:16,695
Speaker 1: I will always want to have my music collection.

764
00:52:16,715 --> 00:52:23,260
Speaker 1: or You know all the illegal stuff that I may or may not do or the political stuff that I may not want out there.

765
00:52:24,063 --> 00:52:30,719
Speaker 1: I will always need my home base that I manage that No one else has any power over whatsoever that I am.

766
00:52:31,123 --> 00:52:42,760
Speaker 1: I'm the master of my own domain Because that's kind of like the love that last inch in V for Vendetta that that one thing that no matter what happens in the outside World I still have that and they can't get me a hundred percent.

767
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:47,560
Speaker 0: Well, I think what the fuck that the solution is gonna be actually is Scott's prediction.

768
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,767
Speaker 0: It's almost guaranteed right.

769
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:51,040
Speaker 0: is that the average person, right?

770
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,667
Speaker 0: He doesn't know or care about computers.

771
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,240
Speaker 0: much is gonna use the Gmail's or whatever.

772
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:00,640
Speaker 0: They're gonna let the big corporation or the big entity in the sky centralized computer, right?

773
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:08,773
Speaker 0: They're gonna let all their stuff be on there, you know, Microsoft Apple mobile me Whatever it is, and that's what they're gonna do cuz that's all they know to do.

774
00:53:09,094 --> 00:53:16,739
Speaker 0: They can't handle it themselves Right, and it'll be a much better experience for them a much easier experience And you know what it'll actually be better for everyone else, too.

775
00:53:17,342 --> 00:53:28,381
Speaker 0: I actually agree because but I don't think everyone has that five percents Yeah, but I think what's gonna happen is the people who care about computing the nerds the geeks the hackers the whatnot Right.

776
00:53:28,822 --> 00:53:49,300
Speaker 0: what they're gonna do right is sort of like what we've been moving to which is you have a server Somewhere and you have you know Still getting all the benefits of cloud computing because you have some computer out in the cloud that you are controlling that is yours And you can get it from anywhere and it's just run by you instead of run by companies.

777
00:53:49,722 --> 00:53:54,280
Speaker 0: So for example, the average person is gonna use Twitter, right?

778
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,398
Speaker 0: Someone runs, you know big old Twitter and all these normal people join it and use it.

779
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:05,832
Speaker 0: The geeks are gonna use they're all gonna run their own iconica servers that will communicate with each other and you get all the advantages.

780
00:54:05,892 --> 00:54:09,042
Speaker 0: but you run it yourself you are in control of the Cloud.

781
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:15,780
Speaker 1: Yeah your piece of it and that is the thing is, you know, I kept saying, you know the 5% You know, I have control at home, but that's the same control.

782
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,983
Speaker 1: I mean theoretically.

783
00:54:17,024 --> 00:54:20,734
Speaker 1: there's the tiny danger of like what if your colo is evil or all?

784
00:54:20,775 --> 00:54:24,440
Speaker 1: but those people are a lot more trustworthy Because they don't give a shit about what you're doing.

785
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:30,539
Speaker 0: I think what all could also happen is if I especially could happen much more easily if IP v6 came around right is?

786
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:43,119
Speaker 0: It would be come very easy for people to just buy sort of like made home server things that you would put in your house And just connect and they would just work and then sort of everyone would be able to run their own.

787
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:49,938
Speaker 1: But at the same time then CP you'll say now again people out there might say but bandwidth no bandwidth will.

788
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:53,540
Speaker 1: eventually I'll always be more and plan a band with my ass.

789
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,440
Speaker 0: People are already buying sling boxes and plugging them in who don't know anything about technology and they totally work.

790
00:54:58,721 --> 00:54:59,544
Speaker 1: But not just that.

791
00:55:00,146 --> 00:55:03,540
Speaker 1: the only real concern here is, you know your safety.

792
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:09,893
Speaker 1: I lost my train of thought like a hundred percent here and I was trying to Talk until I remembered it, but I totally fell asleep box.

793
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,520
Speaker 0: It's like people don't know about this, right?

794
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,144
Speaker 0: It's a device.

795
00:55:12,164 --> 00:55:14,420
Speaker 0: you plug it into your home media center, right?

796
00:55:14,921 --> 00:55:24,231
Speaker 0: And then any device anywhere in the world that has a sling client you can use to connect to your personal Slingbox and control your television forever.

797
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:26,580
Speaker 0: you are so like you leave a DVD in the DVD player at home.

798
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:32,300
Speaker 0: You can watch it on like your palm pilot or your I guess your palm trio on the train or something as long.

799
00:55:33,026 --> 00:55:33,995
Speaker 0: As long as this internet thing.

800
00:55:34,015 --> 00:55:34,620
Speaker 1: box is awesome.

801
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,030
Speaker 1: But I remembered my train of thought and it's a good train of thought.

802
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:49,420
Speaker 1: the other argument will be but there's still that You know the danger because the big concern hackers and geeks always have is that you don't want Someone else to be able to screw you or a single point of failure to be able to prevent you.

803
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,319
Speaker 1: I mean, yes, I have my server in the sky.

804
00:55:51,742 --> 00:55:54,716
Speaker 1: What if the ISP turns evil and decides that they don't like what I'm doing?

805
00:55:54,736 --> 00:56:00,500
Speaker 1: I have a backup Yes, but what is let's say what if I have an ISP at home where currently there's a big monopoly on ISPs.

806
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:04,359
Speaker 1: you don't have a lot of choices and they decide to limit bandwidth or block ports or whatever.

807
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:09,880
Speaker 1: and While those are concerns in the end, they'll also be covered by technology.

808
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:18,371
Speaker 1: I mean in the end, I think where the real action is going to be like in the long long run I'm talking like lifetime maybe even longer.

809
00:56:18,953 --> 00:56:34,787
Speaker 1: in the end all the geek important You know, you can't be the boss of communication is gonna be some sort of global ad hoc anonymous Wireless cloud like cloud in the truest sense to the point that communication There's no point.

810
00:56:35,068 --> 00:56:37,260
Speaker 1: Does anyone have control over the cloud anymore?

811
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:43,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's gonna be a point at which right you can get a device that will plug into the wall, right?

812
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:51,277
Speaker 0: We'll have a very powerful very fast wireless network with a big radius Right and every and have one it will make.

813
00:56:51,297 --> 00:56:58,240
Speaker 0: it will Automatically form a mesh network with other devices in range and automatically create routing tables.

814
00:56:58,321 --> 00:57:00,300
Speaker 0: No one will have to manage it manually, right?

815
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,410
Speaker 1: It won't just be that Everyone's cell phone or will will do this.

816
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:05,734
Speaker 1: all the cell phones will link up.

817
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:09,199
Speaker 1: all the iPhones will link up Every device you carry.

818
00:57:09,532 --> 00:57:27,512
Speaker 1: I mean There's a lot of talking like you know about having cars that have little sensors that have a cloud of car computing So where every car on the road Communicates with all the cars near it and by extension with all the cars down the road and then instead of having a centralized Thing that says, you know, there is traffic ahead use an alternate route.

819
00:57:28,034 --> 00:57:33,126
Speaker 1: The cars all know on their own and This sort of thing is like people.

820
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:39,631
Speaker 1: the buzzword of cloud computing is such weak sauce and people who use it By and large really aren't thinking far.

821
00:57:39,651 --> 00:57:46,960
Speaker 1: They're not thinking in Asimov terms They're thinking in like Google in Adobe because we you're talking about here is actually beyond cloud computing.

822
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,404
Speaker 0: It's it's mesh networking.

823
00:57:48,524 --> 00:57:50,630
Speaker 0: The cloud computing is really just.

824
00:57:50,951 --> 00:57:53,377
Speaker 0: it's no different than the client server model of.

825
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:54,300
Speaker 0: there's a server.

826
00:57:54,663 --> 00:57:58,228
Speaker 0: You just get everything from the server, which does the real Call that cloud.

827
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:08,874
Speaker 0: Well, the reason it's called cloud computing is because there's a difference between the server is right across the room And there's a bunch of clients and the server being somewhere out there.

828
00:58:08,914 --> 00:58:10,720
Speaker 0: You don't really know it's in a cloud.

829
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:18,680
Speaker 0: it's just a Larger separation between the server is on my internet and the server is some mystical thing in the internet lost somewhere.

830
00:58:18,987 --> 00:58:23,736
Speaker 1: I guess for me I just I feel like the way people are using cloud computing right now like most people.

831
00:58:23,756 --> 00:58:31,659
Speaker 1: when they say it They're really just referring to the kind of the mundane next steps that we already have that are just getting slightly more polished as it.

832
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:36,060
Speaker 1: But they talk about those things like they're a revolution and I don't think they are yet.

833
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:41,540
Speaker 0: No, but yet cloud computing the term has been used in so many different ways that it's sort of loaded.
