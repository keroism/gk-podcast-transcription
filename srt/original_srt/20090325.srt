17
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:28,157

18
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,360
Speaker 0: the second day of losing the job, I guess Yeah, I got too used to it though.

00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:39,470
Speaker 0: it's not it's not so good.

24
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:45,891
Speaker 1: At least there's that relief of if you had a long-running project on some bad code and you know that you never have to worry About it.

25
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:46,934
Speaker 0: I know it's like it's weird.

26
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:48,117
Speaker 0: It's like a great way has been.

27
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:54,121
Speaker 0: it's like it's like the Simpsons right remove the stone Whatever it was right.

28
00:01:54,141 --> 00:02:02,630
Speaker 0: the stone in the stonecutters episode Yeah, and Homer's like whoo and like a great stone has been lifted like attach the stone of something else and a much bigger stone.

29
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:06,119

31
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:07,263

56
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:36,230
Speaker 0: You know, I stopped using it for a long time, but now I'm kind of using it again.

57
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,030
Speaker 0: Also because you know, I'm just trying to do things to strengthen my network and strengthen the community.

58
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,350
Speaker 0: You know cuz that helps get a job the thing among other things things that this community needs more.

59
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,987
Speaker 0: So now because even everybody even if that doesn't, you know, get me a job, you know.

60
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,535

61
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:53,484
Speaker 0: right it can't hurt.

62
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,069
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

63
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:55,556
Speaker 0: You know, it'll really help.

64
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:56,079
Speaker 0: if what?

65
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:03,590
Speaker 0: if my attempt at self-employment, you know The bigger and stronger community I have to is like a bigger head start on that.

66
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:13,016
Speaker 0: You know, especially if I'm in the business of making websites, you know I can get sort of more people to use the website right away and if I can get that starting critical mass That'll explode all over the webs.

67
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:15,688
Speaker 0: if my site is actually good and useful and people like it, you know.

68
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,644
Speaker 0: So that's I've been doing that.

69
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:27,033
Speaker 0: so I said hey I got this webcam and every use and I turned on to you stream and basically, you know, I just you streamed all day and I Observation one.

70
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:31,507
Speaker 1: a lot of our listeners did not seem to realize that I pretty much never wear pants ever.

71
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:41,785
Speaker 0: Yeah You've learned something but rims get this is it was just weird that I happened to do it on the day when rim was also Home, I can't even think about the fact that he was home today when I did it.

72
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,210
Speaker 1: Well, I was working.

73
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:45,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but I think I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna.

74
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:49,596
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna use stream my brains out The the bandwidth was totally cool.

75
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:53,990
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna use stream like crazy, you know, not constantly, right?

76
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,430
Speaker 0: I turned it off right now for the show because you know, it doesn't work so well with the laptop.

77
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:00,557
Speaker 0: I'm surprised it didn't work so well in Ubuntu.

78
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:01,279
Speaker 0: That's kind of sad.

79
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:08,022
Speaker 0: the video work, but not the audio which is really strange You know, but it works downstairs in the living room on the Mac.

80
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,590
Speaker 0: It works in my bedroom, right?

81
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,529
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna use stream and have a little unemployment day counter up there, you know.

82
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:15,937
Speaker 0: So today was day two.

83
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:16,843
Speaker 0: tomorrow will be day three.

84
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:22,061
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna do Watching us watch some bad anime that we're gonna talk about.

85
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:28,280
Speaker 0: and actually as a side effect you stream Creates an IRC channel for every show.

86
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:36,273
Speaker 0: so even when the show even when we're not streaming I guess we have an IRC channel now, which I guess Is there.

87
00:05:36,473 --> 00:05:42,970
Speaker 0: and then I don't know how to close the IRC channel if that's such a thing as possible But you know.

88
00:05:42,990 --> 00:06:02,075
Speaker 0: So the video will be on and off depending on what I'm doing and I'll try to keep it on Most of the day when I'm sitting at the computer or whatever I'm not always looking at it or paying attention to the chat, but you know have it on it doesn't hurt You know, and I just I'm gonna use stream it up until I get a job and you know, maybe Maybe something will happen.

89
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:02,757
Speaker 0: Maybe it'll.

90
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:06,010
Speaker 0: it'll go somewhere, you know, maybe someone will give me a job.

91
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:14,195
Speaker 0: Maybe it'll get some publicity like, you know guy goes on you stream marathon to get job in bad economy or you know Something like that.

92
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:20,690
Speaker 0: or maybe it becomes a telethon and people start sending me money So not to work like, you know, the Scott tries to become self-employed.

93
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:34,026
Speaker 0: You stream telethon everyone send Scott money watch him work on this new website and if we send him enough the website will come to be and Then Scott will be self-employed and everyone will have a great new website to waste their time on.

94
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:36,021
Speaker 0: and anyway Yeah, we'll see.

95
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:36,890
Speaker 0: We'll see where this goes.

96
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,810
Speaker 0: But all you have to know is that I'm you stream and you can watch my you stream and join the IRC channel.

97
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:48,690
Speaker 1: But more importantly and this was actually in place before Scott decided to or be came whether or not he decided or not unemployed.

98
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:52,725
Speaker 1: But April 1st, we've got some fun things planned for you guys.

99
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:56,076
Speaker 0: Yes, it is not Everyone is as obvious right.

100
00:06:56,438 --> 00:06:58,002
Speaker 0: April 1st is April Fool's Day.

101
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:00,590
Speaker 0: We're not doing a stupid April Fools.

102
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,790
Speaker 1: You're not gonna like go into this live episode and hear any sort of Rick roll.

103
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:09,930
Speaker 0: No, because I mean you hear us ever on a listen to the old April Fool's Day shows, right?

104
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,940
Speaker 0: We were always like, uh, the internet was useless today.

105
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:18,440
Speaker 0: There were all these obviously fake things, you know It's only good in April Fool's Day if you're actually fooling someone.

106
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:18,882
Speaker 0: to say it.

107
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:25,110
Speaker 0: the way that Fark and board game geek fooled people Right, you know slashed out with their fake news stories is not fooling anyone, right?

108
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,560
Speaker 0: So it's totally lame and we hate it.

109
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:30,610
Speaker 0: and you know We're announcing we're like we're telling you straight up in advance.

110
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:35,048
Speaker 0: We're doing this streaming live geek nights on April 1st.

111
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:42,990
Speaker 0: You know probably sometime and you know between I guess five and nine or who knows what maybe around seven ish Eastern Time, right?

112
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:48,459
Speaker 0: so if We do try to fool you you'll see it coming a mile away.

113
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:56,463

00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:06,230
Speaker 0: I just want to let people know because they're very suspicious or see it's gonna be really lame and we're gonna fool you stupidly.

Speaker 1: Well, you know, we won't do that.

119
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:11,155
Speaker 1: if they wanted to know the rationale we were thinking alright We're gonna have all this stuff together.

120
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,080
Speaker 1: We're gonna do something cool.

121

126
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:47,069
Speaker 0: it's gonna be an ask Grim and Scott type of thing for at least a portion of it and We're gonna use Twitter and suffice to say in the you stream chat and whatever other Communication means we've got going on to ask us questions Which we will answer live with video and then we'll probably record it and put the episode up on the following day.

127
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:48,832
Speaker 0: All right.

128
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:56,389
Speaker 1: All right news down, but it's a manga comics night as you all know and There's actually for once a lot of interesting anime news.

129
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:13,370
Speaker 1: now I want to bring this up first because usually I ignore these sorts of things but For someone who's an anime fan if you don't really know what's going on in Japan or you watch anime, but you don't really Connect what you're watching and what's popular here with what is popular among normal Japanese people.

130
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:17,862
Speaker 1: So I'm looking at a recent listing of across all of television.

131
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,750
Speaker 1: What anime are actually popular in Japan?

132
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,579
Speaker 1: What are the most watched shows right now?

133
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,026
Speaker 0: It's not Naruto.

134
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:24,930
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

135
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:31,730
Speaker 1: Number one is the obvious as always says I saw it says I son people don't know this.

136
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,401
Speaker 0: Sasaisan is basically The Simpsons in Japan.

137
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,224
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

138
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:38,455
Speaker 0: I mean, so That's you know, you don't see.

139
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,210
Speaker 0: it talked about a lot in the anime community because it's not a nerdy anime show.

140
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:47,810
Speaker 0: It doesn't look like a nerdy anime show, but it is an animated show in Japan with a bajillion episodes.

141
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,804
Speaker 0: That is like The Simpsons of Japan and that it's.

142
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:51,788

158
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:55,669

159
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:56,813
Speaker 1: the cat Girl is just a cute girl.

160
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:57,717
Speaker 1: It can turn into a cat.

161
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:02,738
Speaker 1: Yep, and then finally something one piece But people would actually recognize.

162
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:03,160
Speaker 0: there you go.

163
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,587

00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:12,482
Speaker 1: The highest otaku show is right after that fresh free.

168
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:15,457
Speaker 1: It looks like girls fighting.

169
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:17,644
Speaker 1: I can't tell it's okay.

170
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:18,125
Speaker 0: So then it's.

171
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:18,787
Speaker 0: it's some show.

172
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:19,570
Speaker 0: that's on late at night.

173
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,214
Speaker 0: That's all my way.

174
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:22,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't even know it's not late at night.

175
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,435
Speaker 1: But then after that is some baseball show.

176
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:26,321
Speaker 1: All right, and then Pokemon.

177
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:26,762
Speaker 0: Yeah.

178
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:28,206
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sorry Pokemon.

179
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:29,590
Speaker 0: That's pretty low for Pokemon.

180
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,793
Speaker 0: Yeah, well Pokemon's old Real old.

181
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:34,779
Speaker 0: speaking of Pokemon just real quick right.

182
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,390
Speaker 0: Pokemon platinum just came out and Pokemon platinum is basically the same thing.

183
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,130
Speaker 0: You know, they seem to have this pattern right where they'll they'll be a new Pokemon game, right?

184
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,250
Speaker 0: So they'll put out two colors diamond pearl red blue, right?

185
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:51,069
Speaker 0: Gold silver and then a little while later They'll put out a third one.

186
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:56,430
Speaker 0: So this platinum is basically the same as diamond and pearl but it has like a bunch of improvements.

187
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,750
Speaker 0: It's not actually a new game, but it's got like a little bit better.

188
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,419
Speaker 1: And wait improvements like what.

189
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,430
Speaker 1: like I don't have to level up all my Pokemon.

190
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:05,090
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's first of all, right.

191
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,692
Speaker 0: This is what I've heard.

192
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:10,846
Speaker 0: This is what I know from people of talking right pogeyman's as the battle text is faster.

193
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:16,682
Speaker 0: Oh my god There's better animations on the moves that the Pokemon do.

194
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,990
Speaker 0: there's a few new dungeons that sort of thing.

195
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:25,615
Speaker 0: All right, so I realized what I'm gonna do is the next time this Pokemon a new Pokemon series There's gonna be two colors.

196
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:29,486
Speaker 0: I'm gonna skip those because I can't buy the platinum now.

197
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:30,630
Speaker 0: I already have diamond.

198
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:31,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not gonna play.

199
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,990
Speaker 0: it would be stupid, right?

200
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,224
Speaker 0: But if I would have waited and not gotten diamond and just gotten platinum.

201
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:38,669
Speaker 0: I would have been so much better off.

202
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:46,754
Speaker 0: So next time I'm when the two colors come out I'm gonna skip it and when the third one comes out that improves upon the two colors I'll get that one.

203
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:48,740
Speaker 0: and that's the Pokemon plan from Scott.

204
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:52,191
Speaker 1: That is a brilliant plan and it is behind it 100%.

205
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:54,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you're gonna follow the same plan though.

206
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:55,383
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

207
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:56,548
Speaker 1: I think I'm done with Pokemon.

208
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,214
Speaker 0: Ah Pokemon, it's okay.

209
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:01,445
Speaker 1: I played halfway through the original and I watched ash.

210
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,030
Speaker 0: Well, you're gonna read Pokemon adventures, right?

211
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:04,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's my news.

212
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:11,480
Speaker 1: already read Pokemon adventures all the way up through yellow Yellow cover, yeah, he's okay, but he's no red.

213
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:13,226
Speaker 0: No, he's no red Giovanni.

214
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:14,369
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

215
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:16,361
Speaker 1: Oh my god, Pokemon.

216
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:21,797
Speaker 1: Anyway, so More sad is that.

217
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:25,710
Speaker 1: well, it's good for us as anime fans, but it's terrible for us as gaming fans.

218
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,538
Speaker 1: But you might all remember Professor Layton.

219
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,064
Speaker 1: They made these.

220
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:30,350
Speaker 1: it was this game.

221
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:32,561
Speaker 1: It was a puzzle game on the DS and it looked.

222
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:37,979
Speaker 1: it was very anime II and very Stylish in the like Ghibli esque fashion.

223
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:41,730
Speaker 1: It's not Ghibli, but it's Ghibli esque in that kind of like wholesome fun.

224
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,322
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

225
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:45,191
Speaker 0: I liked it Yeah, like.

226
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:49,870
Speaker 1: the style was good like Lupin the third castle of Cagliostro that style of you know, there's an adventure.

227
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:55,254
Speaker 1: let's go with the awesome characters and If you like that sort of thing you'd like this game.

228
00:13:55,415 --> 00:14:05,250
Speaker 1: if you don't like puzzle games because it's also got all that style and all these little movies and story in it and People in America kind of forgot about that game because man I got that game.

229
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,130
Speaker 0: I like to have still been waiting because there's like three or four of them in Japan and I'm waiting.

230
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:11,095
Speaker 1: There's the deal in America.

231
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:12,038
Speaker 1: They released Layton.

232
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,286
Speaker 1: Nintendo marketed the ever-living fuck out of it.

233
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:20,550
Speaker 0: They had people on segues Driving around demos of it in the katsu khan dealers room.

234
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:31,457
Speaker 1: That's how hard they were pushing it also in the street around katsu khan and they built this giant interactive Floor projector thing to demo it and oh my god, it was everywhere.

235
00:14:31,477 --> 00:14:37,541
Speaker 1: They were spending tons of money on marketing and They never released Layton - not yet.

236
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:40,150
Speaker 0: Anyway, or Layton three in the u.s.

237
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:42,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, they released him in Japan, but not in the u.s.

238
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:42,801
Speaker 0: Yet.

239
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:44,790
Speaker 1: I don't think they did well in the u.s.

240
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,523
Speaker 1: I don't think they've recouped into money.

241
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:47,510
Speaker 1: They spent on marketing.

242
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:54,429
Speaker 1: I think I think they expected that the marketing effort would turn into this sort of like cult amazing game that everyone played.

243
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:56,017
Speaker 1: now It just disappeared.

244
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:56,962
Speaker 0: I want it.

245
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:57,606
Speaker 0: I liked it.

246
00:14:57,626 --> 00:15:00,957
Speaker 1: I bought it Because that wasn't the most recent cops.

247
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:01,840
Speaker 0: don't release it now though.

248
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,402
Speaker 0: I have no money.

249
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:04,530
Speaker 1: That was a katsu khan ago.

250
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was back when we had the where we were running stuff, of course We're doing stuff again to the next katsu khan.

251
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,494
Speaker 1: We may or may not be heading up a new department But we'll see.

252
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:15,362
Speaker 0: we'll see about that.

253
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:21,770
Speaker 1: That's all tentative Very very very very tentative, especially because Pax is offering more.

254
00:15:22,492 --> 00:15:25,161
Speaker 0: Well, they're not competing with each other they are to a degree.

255
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:28,010
Speaker 1: I don't think I can manage the same thing for multiple conventions.

256
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:32,586
Speaker 0: Now just do the same thing twice or three, you know, yeah, we'll see.

257
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:33,490
Speaker 1: We'll see anyway.

258
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:37,190
Speaker 0: But it'd be hard to manage three different things with three different conventions.

259
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,478
Speaker 1: If you play Layton, all you can think is man.

260
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,983
Speaker 1: This would make a great anime.

261
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:51,034
Speaker 1: So they're making Layton kyoju to a and no time a professor Layton and the eternal songstress Mm-hmm.

262
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,846
Speaker 1: The film is going to begin in Japan in 2010.

263
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:56,277
Speaker 1: The film is gonna be out I can assure you.

264
00:15:56,297 --> 00:16:00,573
Speaker 1: we will review it post haste and then we'll go see it in the theater In the u.s.

265
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:01,055
Speaker 0: In the theater.

266
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:03,243
Speaker 1: Well, once it comes to the u.s.

267
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:04,146
Speaker 0: It's gonna be in the u.s.

268
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:05,090
Speaker 0: In the theater eventually.

269
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,699
Speaker 1: Oh, man, all big anime movies are in the u.s.

270
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:09,105
Speaker 1: In the theater in New York City.

271
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:10,370
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought it would go.

272
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,616
Speaker 0: I was expecting to get a fan.

273
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:14,690
Speaker 1: So yeah, well, we're gonna watch the fans up first like we always okay.

274
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,790
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm really looking forward to this because the cutscenes alone in that game were so hot.

275
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,935
Speaker 0: Yeah, this could be a good movie.

276
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:21,357
Speaker 0: I'm looking.

277
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:22,040
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward.

278
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,812
Speaker 1: I'm feeling like it'll feel like Cagliostro.

279
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:26,033
Speaker 1: Mmm.

280
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:29,163
Speaker 1: I mean that's one of my favorite movies ever anime or not.

281
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:31,330
Speaker 1: And I don't know this has that kind of vibe.

282
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:37,184
Speaker 1: Yep, but speaking of movies that are getting an official American released Ponyo we talked about it.

283
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:37,770
Speaker 1: We reviewed it.

284
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:46,782
Speaker 1: we watched a pretty good cam cap that Emily's mom acquired of all people but It's actually going to be in US theaters in a somewhat wide release in August.

285
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:49,108
Speaker 0: Disney picked it up as they do forever.

286
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:49,790
Speaker 0: Miyazaki movie.

287
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,950
Speaker 1: Yep, so your Ghibli movie Miyazaki and Lassiter are going to be the executive producers.

Speaker 1: They're doing it.

289
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,038
Speaker 1: They're doing it the same way.

290
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,764
Speaker 1: They do for every Miyazaki movie.

291
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:03,115

307
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:36,346

Speaker 0: we we were so cool.

384
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:24,837

Speaker 1: Hey, I like your car.

389

390
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:43,430

391
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,001
Speaker 1: You want to be in on cool comics?

392
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:49,232
Speaker 1: Just come to New York and go to the mocha Festival.

393
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:52,770
Speaker 0: every also pre-order things because then you get everything two months in it.

394
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,449
Speaker 1: But the problem is you'll get a hundred bad things and one good thing.

395
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:57,349
Speaker 0: You got to know what to buy.

396
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,976
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't get a.

397
00:21:57,996 --> 00:21:58,986

398
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:03,404
Speaker 1: Just go to the mocha festival and just walk around and it's obvious what to buy.

399
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:03,866
Speaker 0: Yeah.

400
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:04,348
Speaker 0: Yeah.

401
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:04,709
Speaker 0: All right.

402
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:06,956
Speaker 1: So, uh, there's one more thing.

403
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,402
Speaker 1: I have to bring this up.

404
00:22:08,523 --> 00:22:10,190
Speaker 1: We're not gonna make it to anime central.

405
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:13,895
Speaker 1: I haven't actually been to anime central since 2003.

406
00:22:13,895 --> 00:22:24,902
Speaker 1: I think Damn Asens the con where we used I used to throw along with the dubbed this crew back in the day Wicked parties in the presidential suite threw at two parties.

407
00:22:24,962 --> 00:22:27,110
Speaker 1: Yes, two years in a row two epic parties.

408
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:31,569
Speaker 1: The second one ended with the hotel Pulling the fire alarm to end our party.

409
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,658
Speaker 1: But I haven't been to a send in a while and I used to enjoy that con.

410
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:41,062
Speaker 1: but they've got a Musical act that I kind of want to go to a send.

411
00:22:41,102 --> 00:23:10,163
Speaker 1: now they have move Back Initial D.

412
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:15,579
Speaker 0: I would go see that if I had money a concert that would be great.

413
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:29,788
Speaker 1: Move m dot o dot v dot e. So if you're in the if you're answered some move music in the show if you're in the Chicago, Illinois area You should go to anime central.

414
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:31,376
Speaker 1: It's as far as I remember.

415
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:32,100
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good time.

416
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,111
Speaker 1: They actually had way back.

417
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:37,889
Speaker 1: I don't know if they still do it, but they used to do Iron artists and they actually did it.

418
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:42,167
Speaker 0: Well, yeah anime central is a very good convention Perhaps the best in the Midwest.

419
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:50,700
Speaker 1: well because as I remember unless they changed it It's still a hotel con and hotel cons have that special charm over convention center con because they go all night.

420
00:24:06,263 --> 00:24:08,800
Speaker 1: But anyway it is time for the Mormon Jesus.

421
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:22,917
Speaker 0: Mormon Jesus Mormon Jesus Mormon Jesus Long long long Jesus.

422
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:27,874
Speaker 0: long ago a spirit child on one of these landings was conceived Unidentified.

423
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:29,603
Speaker 0: God is on his body metal.

424
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:30,970
Speaker 0: Talk about your Jesus, huh?

425
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,177
Speaker 1: These sorts of mashups are always good.

426
00:24:34,217 --> 00:24:35,742
Speaker 1: And this one's actually pretty well done.

427
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:36,264
Speaker 1: so I can't.

428
00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:37,790
Speaker 1: it sticks in your head.

429
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:42,188
Speaker 1: There's something about Mormon Jesus doo doo doo doo plus MC hammer.

430
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:45,204
Speaker 1: Come on I don't know what else I can say.

431
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:46,332
Speaker 1: That's it The guy.

432
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:51,510
Speaker 1: if you watch the video the guy in red really looks like he's dancing to this music.

433
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:52,798
Speaker 1: It really fits.

434
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:54,790
Speaker 0: speaking of MC hammer, right?

435
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:00,861
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know if people realize just how popular MC hammer was back in the day But he hammers like was so so awesome.

436
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:05,869
Speaker 1: MC Hammer is possibly one of the most important human beings to have ever lived.

437
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:13,666
Speaker 0: Anyway hammer You know after he basically had a sort of a similar to Mike Tyson's story.

438
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,548
Speaker 0: only he wasn't a bad, dude He was a good dude.

439
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,549
Speaker 0: He just you know got famous got a bunch of money and lost all his money, right?

440
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,289
Speaker 0: Mike Tyson lost all his money because he was not a good person.

441
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:27,329
Speaker 0: MC hammer lost all his money because he was not frugal And he didn't keep track of his money very well.

442
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:31,480
Speaker 0: So after that MC hammer became like a preacher and such and such.

443
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,931
Speaker 0: right but he still had his dancing skills and singing skills Right.

444
00:25:36,573 --> 00:25:40,625
Speaker 0: and in recent years MC hammer has been making this comeback on the internets.

445
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:42,150
Speaker 0: He's got internet skills.

446
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:44,810
Speaker 0: He's on the Twitter right and he's doing all sorts of internet stuffs.

468
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,226
Speaker 1: You could dance while you're making the website.

00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:55,509
Speaker 0: I could dance if I wanted to.

470
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:59,610
Speaker 1: You could leave your friends behind If your friends.

471
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,318
Speaker 0: Anyway dance jam calm.

472
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:06,150
Speaker 0: awesome dancing videos MC hammer.

473
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:15,249
Speaker 1: So Mormon Jesus aside we decided to actually watch just Mormon Jesus some Mormon Mormon Jesus.

474
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:20,082
Speaker 1: But we actually watched some anime.

475
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:21,829
Speaker 1: some of you were treated to watching us.

476
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:27,482
Speaker 1: Watch the anime on the you stream Yes, which had to be interesting because you couldn't see what we were seeing.

477
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:29,330
Speaker 1: you could just see what we were saying.

478
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:36,640
Speaker 1: hmm, anyway, we watched a new show and an old show and One was pretty good.

479
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,993
Speaker 1: One was pretty bad I don't know.

480
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:45,010
Speaker 0: I sort of think that they were all both sort of bad, but at least one was funny in its badness.

481
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:52,750
Speaker 0: But I think you just because it was old both shows are very stereotypical very predictable very anime cliche.

482
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:58,309
Speaker 0: One was old and humorous and one was new and painful.

483
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:12,184
Speaker 1: I guess the cliches of older shows while they are cliches and it depends on what what era and genre too, but the genre of Shonen fighting show from the 90s as opposed to Shonen fighting show from the 2000s.

484
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:14,210
Speaker 1: There's a big difference.

485
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:20,044
Speaker 0: I don't see such a big difference Not in the plot structure at least but in the way the episodes come together.

486
00:28:20,085 --> 00:28:24,149
Speaker 0: and what clear you have to go to a Shonen fighting show from the 80s to get a different plot structure like.

487
00:28:24,491 --> 00:28:35,547
Speaker 1: Maybe it's more that this show while it is a 90s show Harkins much more back to shows from the earlier 90s in the late 80s in terms of the cliches that it is using a little bit a little bit.

488
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:39,468
Speaker 0: But anyway, so the show the further we'll talk about that show first, right?

489
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:39,870
Speaker 1: We should talk.

490
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:42,067
Speaker 1: Maybe we should talk about the show that's less good first.

491
00:28:42,107 --> 00:28:44,173
Speaker 1: I don't know This order.

492
00:28:44,193 --> 00:28:44,755
Speaker 0: we watched him.

493
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:46,181
Speaker 0: All right, it doesn't matter.

494
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:46,884
Speaker 0: So we watch.

495
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:48,370
Speaker 1: I kind of like this show.

496
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,319
Speaker 0: Do you really you would?

497
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:50,420
Speaker 0: what?

498
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,646
Speaker 0: would you watch another episode of it?

499
00:28:51,948 --> 00:28:52,309
Speaker 1: Uh-huh?

500
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,321
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could see myself doing that really cuz.

501
00:28:54,362 --> 00:28:55,690
Speaker 0: I would not watch another episode.

502
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,818
Speaker 1: But at least got to get to the episode with the time.

503
00:28:57,858 --> 00:29:00,929
Speaker 1: I got to find out what's up with the mobile Roshi Mobutofu.

Speaker 1: But yeah, this is actually.

526
00:29:58,483 --> 00:29:59,530
Speaker 1: it looks to me.

527
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:06,850
Speaker 1: I don't know it feels like an earlier 90s show, but it's actually from like the late 90s like 97 98 Yeah, and there's a lot a lot of similar things out there.

528
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,540
Speaker 0: I mean Ironwalk Jen and or whatever else you can come up with.

529
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,085
Speaker 0: but oh my god.

00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:12,887
Speaker 1: There are 52 episodes.

531
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:15,621
Speaker 0: You want to watch them all?

532
00:30:16,185 --> 00:30:16,910

Speaker 0: Yeah, but cooking master boy.

534
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:29,014
Speaker 0: It's it takes place in China during the warring cooking States Literally.

535
00:30:29,054 --> 00:30:30,020
Speaker 0: this is why it's funny.

536
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:30,643
Speaker 0: it starts

537
00:30:30,683 --> 00:30:39,636
Speaker 1: with this opener, and they're like Chinese cuisine has spread throughout the world and the cores of it, and it shows like Canton and sash

538
00:30:39,696 --> 00:30:40,238
Speaker 0: rod

539
00:30:40,278 --> 00:31:05,446
Speaker 1: and it's very serious and building up and showing different regions of Japan and all this Fancy cooking animation all sell animated and then it cuts to this giant panorama And it explains that we are now in the period at the fall of the Manchu dynasty in the like cooking warring states period And the government like the government is very intertwined with cooking.

540
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:06,669
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell.

541
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:13,640
Speaker 0: yeah It's just like an admiral or a general because the subtitles are broken when we watched it But we didn't need them to be working all right.

542
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:26,190
Speaker 0: This show is pretty straightforward and you know he basically orders this guy to go and to this to this restaurant and You know sort of take it over because the people at the restaurant are cooking.

543
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:34,235
Speaker 1: Basically sayonji from utenna walks in to this restaurant and first of all oh shit Everyone's like oh, no.

544
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:36,807
Speaker 1: It's him and they back away comes into the restaurant.

545
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:40,600
Speaker 1: He's like Give me whatever you dare to save me.

546
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,245
Speaker 1: It's hit like ratatouille in that way.

547
00:31:42,606 --> 00:31:45,356
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like give me something I don't care what as long as it's good.

548
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,021
Speaker 0: They give him like the best stuff.

549
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,490
Speaker 0: They got it's no good.

550
00:31:49,771 --> 00:31:51,999
Speaker 1: So he proceeds to wreck the place.

551
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,403
Speaker 0: yep, and he's like I'm in charge of this restaurant now I have the seal from General Lee.

552
00:31:57,423 --> 00:31:58,650
Speaker 1: it is my restaurant now.

553
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,820
Speaker 0: Then General Lee shows up and General Lee is.

554
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,210
Speaker 0: oh first of all by the way while this is going on the main Character is not there.

555
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:12,432
Speaker 0: He's up on a mountain collecting mushrooms that are like the tastiest mushrooms from the growing on the side of a mountain that he had To climb.

556
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:16,913
Speaker 0: you know they look like some pretty good mushroom right anyway General Lee shows up And he's like.

557
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:18,687
Speaker 0: I think you misunderstood me.

558
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:29,986
Speaker 0: I was telling you you know I didn't put my seal on that order yet You have to prove that you're better Than the people at this restaurant in order for me to sign to put my seal on that order.

559
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:32,734
Speaker 1: and that statement is backed Up by this man's eyebrows.

560
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:33,316
Speaker 0: Oh yes.

561
00:32:33,657 --> 00:32:37,950
Speaker 0: Oh yes indeed, so he's like oh of course I can beat these crappy cooks here.

562
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,857
Speaker 0: What do you want me to make you?

563
00:32:38,877 --> 00:32:40,429
Speaker 0: he's like fried rice?

564
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,669
Speaker 1: So this guy they and they spend a lot of time animating this cook.

565
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:51,430
Speaker 0: yeah It's like other times or sometimes during the show you'll get a still shot of like General Lee's face.

566
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:59,363
Speaker 0: That's not moving while someone else talks right and that still frame will be there for a good 10 20 seconds.

567
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:04,661
Speaker 0: right but When he does someone's cooking they animate the fuck out of it.

568
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:10,017
Speaker 0: flying locks like motion blur Ladles this guy's story.

569
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:11,281
Speaker 1: it cuts to a flashback.

570
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:19,085
Speaker 1: We lost all our subtitles at this point, but basically He takes off his eyepatch, and he's got this burn scarred eye in hand and he's like.

571
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:22,357
Speaker 1: you don't remember You don't know.

572
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:36,725
Speaker 1: and then we get the flashback of him as a kid but he's just as pissed off and sneering and he's cooking and he's pissed off and The mother is like you shouldn't cook that way You're gonna hurt yourself like you're not the boss of me mom, and then he immediately burns his face off.

573
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:44,650
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, it's like sets his whole body on fire because he gets oil on himself, and it's it's a bad situation.

574
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:47,909
Speaker 0: So now he's coming back to this restaurant to get his revenge this

575
00:33:48,650 --> 00:34:01,442
Speaker 1: Lobster shrimp crab fried rice and there's this scene where you know he cooks it And it's all together and he gives it to admiral Lee and there's all this big presentation and admiral Lee like opens it And he takes a bite and it cuts.

576
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:03,210
Speaker 1: it was almost a gecky guy moment.

577
00:34:03,271 --> 00:34:13,780
Speaker 1: It cuts to his face like a close-up You know the close-up where you get like from the edge of the nose to the edge of the face And then you see like the eye and that's it.

578
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:21,530
Speaker 1: you get like a close-up of one eye and a little bit of the mouth Yep, and he closes his eyes, and he sits there for a second, and then he opens him like

579
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:29,649
Speaker 0: And like this nuke goes off and then like the word delicious scrolls by you get like this golden letters.

580
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:37,889
Speaker 1: first You get this pet this giant sea view and then a tsunami coming in and then behind the tsunami a volcano explodes.

581
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:46,150
Speaker 0: Yes, they use video and audio because you know you can't get flavor vision right which would be the ultimate for a cooking show Right to just send the flavor into the viewers mouth.

582
00:34:48,313 --> 00:34:49,520
Speaker 0: You know if that ever wasn't?

583
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,405
Speaker 0: you know really?

584
00:34:50,485 --> 00:35:05,710
Speaker 0: if I was the Food Network I would put all my money into that because if that existed the Food Network would be the number one channel and forever People just sit at home watching the Food Channel Just like tasting it's done smelling everything that these gourmet chefs go.

585
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:10,489
Speaker 1: Then you have what is set up to be the best hack ever.

586
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:15,309
Speaker 0: The most like this would be the hack everyone's TVs to make it taste like shit.

587
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:18,921
Speaker 1: What I was going to say very simply is one word.

588
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:21,329
Speaker 1: I was going to say poop yep, and leave it at that.

589
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:26,109
Speaker 1: so anyway, so Yo, you know the guys close.

590
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:30,208
Speaker 1: He opens his eyes and like yes, you will take over this restaurant.

591
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:37,590
Speaker 1: the kids like And he eats it and the same thing happens to him like it's too good It's too good, and I mean this is some awesome fried rice.

592
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,657
Speaker 0: He had lobsters and crabs and shrimps.

593
00:35:39,698 --> 00:35:43,110
Speaker 0: and but somehow he like got rid of the fishy flavor.

594
00:35:43,595 --> 00:35:48,988
Speaker 0: So it like had all this seafood in it But it didn't taste fishy and it was like this ultimate awesome fried rice of all.

595
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:53,287
Speaker 1: yes But then the kid is like but but wait a minute, and it shows you all these like.

596
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:53,809
Speaker 1: he's like.

597
00:35:54,131 --> 00:35:57,676
Speaker 0: It's very sad subtitle so we didn't know exactly what he was saying.

598
00:35:57,757 --> 00:36:06,428
Speaker 1: but remember in Samurai Jack when he closes his eyes and he listens and bit by bit the scene like Fills out around him as he hears all the things going on.

599
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:09,966
Speaker 1: yep It was like that with food where you see the flavor.

600
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:15,810
Speaker 1: He's like yes, I play There's the crab, and there's the shrimp, and there's the rice, but wait a minute wait a minute.

601
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:18,738
Speaker 0: Cilantro was it's a lot.

602
00:36:18,798 --> 00:36:19,926
Speaker 0: I think about it in cilantro.

603
00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:20,570
Speaker 1: That's my guess.

604
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,495
Speaker 1: It could have been covered it up with cilantro.

605
00:36:22,696 --> 00:36:30,897
Speaker 1: and as soon as he says that the admiralee has that you know shonen Where there's like the red line goes

606
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:41,390
Speaker 0: exactly what it was, but there was a picture of a green herb on the screen and Obviously there was some sort of suggestion that there was not something imperfect about this incredibly delicious fried rice.

607
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:44,567
Speaker 1: Yes, and admiralee is stern but fair.

608
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,070
Speaker 1: yeah.

609
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,816
Speaker 0: So so he's like okay.

610
00:36:47,896 --> 00:36:49,000
Speaker 0: You know the basically what happens to?

611
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,195
Speaker 0: the kid is now going to make fried rice to beat this dude's fried Rice right now.

612
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,545
Speaker 0: I thought the kid was going to use the amazing mushrooms.

613
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:56,369
Speaker 0: He got from the side of the.

614
00:36:56,429 --> 00:36:57,616
Speaker 1: no That's episode two.

615
00:36:57,838 --> 00:36:59,670
Speaker 1: He's probably gonna use that in the mob horror.

616
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:07,890
Speaker 0: No mobile tofu Possibly possibly, but he said he goes to make the kid the main character goes to make some fried rice.

617
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,895
Speaker 0: So what does he do?

618
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:13,270
Speaker 0: of course as in all the cooking shows?

619
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,433
Speaker 1: It's it's ready to eat.

620
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:19,250
Speaker 0: the really perfect simple dish always beats the complicated fancy gourmet dish.

621
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,345
Speaker 0: I mean you see this happen in in a comic.

622
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:24,454
Speaker 0: I read a while ago Wonton soup.

623
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:26,101
Speaker 0: right that's what hat.

624
00:37:26,141 --> 00:37:27,065
Speaker 0: that's what happens.

625
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:27,748
Speaker 0: You know.

626
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:33,650
Speaker 0: so He's gonna make the really simple dish really well, and it's gonna beat out the gourmet dish.

627
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,201
Speaker 1: He just makes egg fried rice, but just makes egg fried rice.

628
00:37:37,362 --> 00:37:39,950
Speaker 1: It's the recipe what his mom taught him.

629
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:48,821
Speaker 0: Yeah, the mom who is the mom who I think is the same person that was involved with the burning of the angry guy Yep, so I came back to get his revenge.

630
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:51,456
Speaker 0: mom is dead now because they have a picture of mom They're holding on to.

631
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:53,050
Speaker 0: I think mom's dead now anyway.

632
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:58,212
Speaker 0: So he makes fried rice, and he make you know we're just egg and fried rice and some soy Whatever.

633
00:37:58,293 --> 00:38:07,840
Speaker 0: now when they bring this out like they bring out the dish and and we're leaves well No, but when they brought out the first dish right it was covered and they lifted the cover And it's like perfectly symmetrical.

634
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,769
Speaker 0: amazing steam came out, right.

635
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:20,407
Speaker 0: But when the kids golden fried rice comes out that he made with just egg It's like this exploding golden pillar of light that shoots into the sky.

636
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:24,379
Speaker 0: yeah And then the rice itself looks like gold flakes.

637
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:30,019
Speaker 1: it doesn't look like rice and admirably is like it is Golden fried rice.

638
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:32,568
Speaker 0: yeah, but the other guys like don't be fooled by the way.

639
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:33,533
Speaker 0: It looks It's just.

640
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:36,306
Speaker 0: you know he made it all golden with you know egg.

641
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:37,210
Speaker 0: It's not really that great.

642
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,612
Speaker 0: It's real simple golden fried rice Before.

643
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:41,759
Speaker 0: I can't compare with my fancy seafood fried rice.

644
00:38:41,999 --> 00:39:01,830
Speaker 1: when he ate the other guy's dish right and he closes his eye and bites It I was hoping for the gecky guy moment because the gecky guy moment is the same thing that happens in Giant Robo where you have the the stoic man hero standing there And he has his eyes closed and then he does something and the tear comes out of the eye from the close-up.

645
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:04,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't get that I didn't expect that from this show.

646
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:09,026
Speaker 1: He bites into the golden rice and the the gecky got here comes out.

647
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:09,689
Speaker 0: that was epic.

648
00:39:11,337 --> 00:39:13,127
Speaker 0: It was only really only epic as we called it.

649
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:19,310
Speaker 0: But you know pretty much the rice was not only delicious, but it brought back all his memories.

650
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:29,750
Speaker 0: So the nostalgic awesome power of the goal of the simple Perfect golden fried rice brought out the man tear and won over the general to the side of the main character.

651
00:39:30,312 --> 00:39:33,809
Speaker 1: Anytime you get the close-up of the one eye, and then the tears come down.

652
00:39:34,732 --> 00:39:35,354
Speaker 1: That's a good.

653
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:36,377
Speaker 1: It has to be.

654
00:39:36,397 --> 00:39:39,126
Speaker 1: you know the very stoic face the eyes closed.

655
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:41,598
Speaker 1: moment of realization Single tear.

656
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:43,390
Speaker 1: yep very crying Freeman.

657
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:46,778
Speaker 0: Crying Freeman had frickin rivers, but both eyes.

658
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:47,520
Speaker 0: He didn't have.

659
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:51,936
Speaker 1: yeah, but you know there, and I haven't read crying Freeman There's got to be at least one shot.

660
00:39:52,258 --> 00:40:01,929
Speaker 0: where he closes his eye and like the tears begin It's usually he kills someone and then they cut back to his face, and there's like rivers, and that's usually how it goes.

661
00:40:02,852 --> 00:40:03,855
Speaker 0: Anyway crying from it.

662
00:40:03,996 --> 00:40:08,450
Speaker 1: of course this doesn't resolve it and admiralee's like well blah blah blah challenge challenge.

663
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:18,300
Speaker 1: We had no subtitles at this point, but what I gathered was that they are now going to have to cook Mobutofu and the kid has this like it was.

664
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:22,076
Speaker 0: I guess I'm not used to seeing first the kids like yeah I'm awesome at tofu.

665
00:40:22,116 --> 00:40:25,194
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but I watched so much new anime I forgot about.

666
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:34,130
Speaker 1: I guess the old style of chibi like old anime used to go to Chibi at a certain kind of way and new anime do it in this totally different way for the most part.

667
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:37,610
Speaker 1: But this was an old-school like cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap.

668
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:45,878
Speaker 1: He's like yeah, yeah, yeah, I can make the tofu yes, and then admiralee is like no You're not just making Mobutofu basically.

669
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:52,359
Speaker 1: I heard you know I don't I don't understand much Japanese blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Mabaroshi.

670
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:57,630
Speaker 1: no Mobutofu Did he say Mabaroshi?

671
00:40:59,010 --> 00:40:59,873
Speaker 0: That's dream right.

672
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:03,567
Speaker 0: so it's like the dream tofu or mystery or mystery.

673
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:04,390
Speaker 1: I'll look it up again.

674
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,157
Speaker 1: It's a word that I hear a lot in anime.

675
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:13,069
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's dream or something, but it's like yeah It's like five or six flavors to be honest mysterious tofu I don't know.

676
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:21,518
Speaker 0: But it has like five or six flavors or seven flavors or something and they were like seven factors by which he would judge the tofu And it's like oh my god like hotness.

677
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:34,356
Speaker 0: and uh so that's probably what the next episode is gonna Be is is the tofu battle and somehow he's gonna have a lot of struggles But then he's gonna pull it off in the end by some miracle is gonna make the great illusion fantasy Mirage.

678
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:39,695
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway, oh Oh much better.

679
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:40,498
Speaker 1: Oh never mind.

680
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:42,123
Speaker 1: I found a translation.

681
00:41:42,143 --> 00:41:43,106
Speaker 1: That was actually wrong.

682
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:48,957
Speaker 0: I Never mind that all right, so yeah That's that's cooking master boy.

683
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:54,560
Speaker 0: if you want to watch one of those it mean it's a stereotypical Shonen fighting cooking show.

684
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:56,833
Speaker 0: it's just like all the other ones fun You know what it is.

685
00:41:56,933 --> 00:42:07,786
Speaker 1: it is a show that if you run an anime club you show the first Episode of this at your club and everyone goes And yells during it or you get all your friends over, and you watch it.

686
00:42:07,806 --> 00:42:08,630
Speaker 1: Don't watch it by yourself.

687
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not.

688
00:42:09,272 --> 00:42:20,827
Speaker 0: actually it's not a quality show, but you know it's a formula show But it executes the formula rather well And if you're an anime fan there is a lot of humor to be extracted from it.

689
00:42:21,149 --> 00:42:23,990
Speaker 1: it also It gave me an enjoyment.

690
00:42:24,131 --> 00:42:29,291
Speaker 1: This is definitely a nostalgic enjoyment in the same way that birdie the mighty deco Did.

691
00:42:29,311 --> 00:42:39,849
Speaker 1: that it kind of brought me back into anime that I liked not so much because it was better necessarily But because I watched it when I was the right age to watch it.

692
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:43,464
Speaker 0: Sort of like the same feeling you get when you eat golden fried rice.

693
00:42:43,786 --> 00:42:44,730
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, something like that.

694
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:47,910
Speaker 0: So the next it's not actually that as great as the seafood fried rice.

695
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:52,690
Speaker 0: I'm you see but your memories of it are us power cause it to bring out the power.

696
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:59,499
Speaker 1: So if I ever watch the about the new like bubblegum crisis remake whatever I'll have to close my eyes and shed that single tear.

697
00:42:59,921 --> 00:43:05,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, so then we watched a generic show Chrome shelled reggios.

698
00:43:05,896 --> 00:43:09,086
Speaker 1: It's exactly like every other generic crappy anime.

699
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:12,615
Speaker 0: This is the most Generic anime I've ever seen.

700
00:43:12,635 --> 00:43:17,166
Speaker 0: it pretty much has every generic anime thing that you could have like it was.

701
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:21,581
Speaker 1: it was painful it I don't even know so well.

702
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,826
Speaker 1: it stood out a little bit.

703
00:43:22,926 --> 00:43:31,313
Speaker 1: it starts right and Typically, you know some sort of action scene going on and then they cut to someone who's going to be one of the main characters Like cowering.

704
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:34,463
Speaker 1: you see like ten anime start that way like fighting going on.

705
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:37,756
Speaker 1: main characters actually badass But not badass yet.

706
00:43:38,077 --> 00:43:40,790
Speaker 1: and badassness is hidden and they're cowering and they're gonna be afraid.

707
00:43:41,432 --> 00:43:46,687
Speaker 0: So you've got this this bus I guess and it's being attacked by a big bug monster filth monster.

708
00:43:46,787 --> 00:43:47,670
Speaker 0: Hi, it's a bug.

709
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:48,968
Speaker 0: It's like Starship Troopers.

710
00:43:50,153 --> 00:43:56,470
Speaker 0: And you see this big lineup of like mystical powerful people and there's like a whole bunch of them and they're like 20 of them.

711
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,874
Speaker 0: There's basically one.

712
00:43:58,175 --> 00:43:59,719
Speaker 0: for every single stereotype.

713
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:08,790
Speaker 0: you can find dude, dude with a sword dude with monofilament wire Dude with psychic powers dude with mystical spiritual powers, and there's just can't do it with fucking guns.

714
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:11,620
Speaker 0: Dude with a dude in a robot suit.

715
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,822
Speaker 0: you got every single stereotypical Combat anime character lined up.

716
00:44:17,144 --> 00:44:18,310
Speaker 1: don't even do anything.

717
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:22,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, like only three or four of them are doing anything and they fight the bug monster.

718
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,810
Speaker 1: Oh, and it's all full of proper noun gobbledygook.

719
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:26,292
Speaker 1: It's me.

720
00:44:26,513 --> 00:44:27,297
Speaker 1: It's do the.

721
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:29,970
Speaker 1: do the blah on the blah, but watch out for the blah.

722
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:32,139
Speaker 1: We'll have to beat him by using blah and blah together.

723
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,243
Speaker 1: But such a thing.

724
00:44:33,263 --> 00:44:34,006
Speaker 1: I don't know.

725
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:34,870
Speaker 1: Well, what if we blind?

726
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,553
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

727
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:36,780
Speaker 0: Don't use your full power.

728
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:38,470
Speaker 0: Oh, but now I have to use my full power.

729
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:43,790
Speaker 1: As you know, it is an insult in Japan to use your full power at any moment other than the last possible.

730
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:54,310
Speaker 0: Yeah more so than anything else I think yeah anyway so that it starts out there.

731
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:00,126
Speaker 0: But then it cuts away from that to this completely unrelated school military school.

732
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,370
Speaker 0: That's also a regular school.

733
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,829
Speaker 1: Well, it's basically all right.

734
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:13,165
Speaker 1: It's a high school that's run by students a la utenna and I'm pretty sure I had to look it up I'm pretty sure the headmaster who is actually just like a senior in the school.

735
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:13,928
Speaker 0: Who's talking here?

736
00:45:13,948 --> 00:45:14,129
Speaker 0: Okay.

737
00:45:14,149 --> 00:45:17,645
Speaker 1: Yes I'm like 99% sure that that is pumpkin head.

738
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:26,290
Speaker 1: Yeah You know I aka Takahashi Rios K aka every cool person in every but mint.

739
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:31,177
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah People know that we love Takahito Kiyosu.

740
00:45:31,217 --> 00:45:34,948
Speaker 1: Takahito Kiyosu is second only to Akira Kamiya in my eyes.

741
00:45:34,968 --> 00:45:35,670
Speaker 0: I don't know.

742
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,414
Speaker 0: There's also - day that guy.

743
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:41,909
Speaker 0: Oh, I forget that guy's name, but I reckon I like I if you told me his name.

744
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:42,170
Speaker 0: It's like.

745
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:46,650
Speaker 0: It's a name that I recognize but I can't just recall it from nothing.

746
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:47,454
Speaker 0: cuz that guy's like.

747
00:45:47,534 --> 00:45:55,530
Speaker 0: if you told me the name if I like if you walked up to me on the street and said who Is and said the name I would say that's the guy who is Chiyo Chan's dad.

748
00:45:56,012 --> 00:46:03,703
Speaker 1: We didn't recognize who he was until we were watching Baccano and that guy's like carol Dorshte and we're like, it's him.

749
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:07,023
Speaker 1: It has to be Yeah, that guy could say Dorshte really like.

750
00:46:07,043 --> 00:46:09,880
Speaker 0: I can't come up with his name But if you give me the name, I can tell you who it is.

751
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:27,202
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'll start calling him carol Anyway, but but this guy is he's like a toga I guess and he runs the school because it's a student-run school and there's military people and non-military people And there's all this high school bullshit.

752
00:46:27,464 --> 00:46:28,369
Speaker 1: and then some people fight.

753
00:46:29,691 --> 00:46:31,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, like, you know these.

754
00:46:31,796 --> 00:46:42,790
Speaker 0: the guy who you know, isn't obviously the most powerful really is the most powerful But he doesn't know it yet and he joins like their lowest of the lowest ranks in the school.

755
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:47,769
Speaker 0: You know by you know chance and of course that's gonna.

756
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:50,169
Speaker 0: you know The lowest of the lows are gonna be awesome now.

757
00:46:50,692 --> 00:47:01,150
Speaker 0: And there's also drama because like the does it the quiet sort of mystical Mystery girl is also in that same squadron and she's the sister of the headmaster guy.

758
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:07,490
Speaker 0: So it's you know typical, you know, the scrappy low low end of the totem pole is gonna beat out.

759
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:14,575
Speaker 0: you know the high and mighty heads of the totem pole who are so sure of themselves and already powerful and Yawn.

760
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:25,865
Speaker 1: at this point they have introduced So many characters that I had no idea I only recognized like a few of them Recognize the short quiet mystical girl with the cherry blossoms quite mystical girl.

761
00:47:25,945 --> 00:47:29,704
Speaker 0: the head of the lowest end Squadron like the 17th squadron.

762
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:38,208
Speaker 0: that girl The headmaster guy headmaster guy and the you know, the new guy who's all powerful secretly But that's pretty much it.

763
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:46,843
Speaker 1: All the other guys are nothing has the exact same face and haircut as the guy from Kazanoyo Jimbo Which was an okay show that suffered from I don't know.

764
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:58,830
Speaker 1: I got to make up on like a Quick like syndrome name for this but the show where you have a main character Who's basically invincible and all-powerful and badass and just kicks everybody's ass all the time in every episode.

765
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:01,441
Speaker 0: I mean every show not every show.

766
00:48:01,522 --> 00:48:05,220
Speaker 1: almost every show Trigon starts like that But then it's not like that anymore.

767
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:10,483
Speaker 1: a lot of shows are like that But it looks like the same person as far as I can tell.

768
00:48:10,503 --> 00:48:12,270
Speaker 1: I got to see who the character designer was for this.

769
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:15,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then again, it might just be generic anime character.

770
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:24,682
Speaker 0: So basically that plot continues a bunch and you know, of course the low powerful guy joins the the the you know The lowest end group and they're

771
00:48:24,742 --> 00:48:27,235
Speaker 1: they cut back to the fight again Which by the way during the fight

772
00:48:27,276 --> 00:48:28,461
Speaker 0: from the beginning of the episode

773
00:48:28,602 --> 00:48:32,616
Speaker 1: they're placing they're playing like Sandstorm esque techno.

774
00:48:32,937 --> 00:48:33,539
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's right.

775
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:41,510
Speaker 0: during the fighting scene that at the very beginning of the show Where you know, they had the bug monster and everything that's completely unrelated to this school so far.

776
00:48:41,691 --> 00:48:43,741
Speaker 0: It's obviously gonna be related to the school later.

777
00:48:44,002 --> 00:48:45,570
Speaker 1: It just sounds like Darude is playing in the back.

778
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just it's like this super hyper techno.

779
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,209
Speaker 0: That's actually kind of good, but also kind of not so good.

780
00:48:52,491 --> 00:48:54,056
Speaker 0: Then at the school, there's no techno.

781
00:48:54,597 --> 00:48:56,242
Speaker 0: then after they're done with the school.

782
00:48:56,523 --> 00:49:02,340
Speaker 0: They cut back to fighting the bug monster Has no connection to the school yet whatsoever.

783
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,427
Speaker 1: and then they introduced like a million weird mysteries.

784
00:49:04,467 --> 00:49:06,615
Speaker 1: then they in the episode Yeah, that's it.

785
00:49:06,635 --> 00:49:08,401
Speaker 0: they budget mysteries there's.

786
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:09,665
Speaker 0: they defeat the bug monster.

787
00:49:09,685 --> 00:49:13,336
Speaker 1: they're like 10 or 15 Superpowered people fighting this bug monster.

788
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:17,690
Speaker 1: Oh and by the way in the school when I said some guys were fighting they all had superpowers.

789
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:19,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone's got some sort of superpower.

790
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:22,159
Speaker 1: Everyone has superpowers in this show as far as I can tell.

791
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:23,363
Speaker 0: One guy has a big whip.

792
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:25,230
Speaker 0: one guy is an extending stick.

793
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,677
Speaker 0: You know one person can shoot flower petals.

794
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:30,346
Speaker 1: When I say big whip it is like 200 feet long.

795
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:31,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's real long.

796
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:47,862
Speaker 1: But then during all this they keep cutting back to this line of even more super powered people who are standing there commenting on the fighting and then they act like maybe it's not a Fight really but like a contest or a test.

797
00:49:48,003 --> 00:49:49,970
Speaker 1: and then I lost like all track of what was going on.

798
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:54,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you had the two completely separate unrelated things going on you.

799
00:49:54,127 --> 00:50:00,250
Speaker 0: the school plot Which is so generic predictable had the same characters as every other stupid anime.

800
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:02,763
Speaker 0: Everything that happened was totally predictable.

801
00:50:02,783 --> 00:50:04,170
Speaker 0: saw coming a million miles away.

802
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:08,010
Speaker 0: The only interesting thing about it was Takahito Koyasu's voice, right?

803
00:50:09,432 --> 00:50:15,174
Speaker 0: And then you had a separate plot of fighting a big bug monster and be not him All right.

804
00:50:15,294 --> 00:50:16,037
Speaker 1: I'm looking into this.

805
00:50:16,117 --> 00:50:17,081
Speaker 1: It might not have been him.

806
00:50:17,322 --> 00:50:19,268
Speaker 1: There might be a sound alike up there is nevermind.

807
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:27,081
Speaker 0: Okay And then Completely detached at least in the first episode from the school plot.

808
00:50:27,221 --> 00:50:30,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's him and it was just You know.

809
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:39,825
Speaker 0: unless you really really like Stereotypical generic right down the middle follow the formula, you know.

810
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:45,521
Speaker 1: action and school Anime, even if you like that watch one of the better ones.

811
00:50:45,682 --> 00:50:46,525
Speaker 1: This one is like.

812
00:50:46,786 --> 00:50:48,030
Speaker 1: at least watch like the best.

813
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:50,017
Speaker 0: This is so plain.

814
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:50,900
Speaker 0: It's like eat it.

815
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,145
Speaker 0: This is like white bread.

816
00:50:52,165 --> 00:50:54,655
Speaker 1: It's Why it's a Wonder Bread.

817
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:56,141
Speaker 0: This is this is fucking Wonder Bread.

818
00:50:56,182 --> 00:50:58,010
Speaker 0: this show, you know, totally predictable.

819
00:50:58,532 --> 00:51:02,405
Speaker 0: Nothing new nothing exciting exactly what you'd expect.

820
00:51:02,445 --> 00:51:03,870
Speaker 0: seen it a million times before.

821
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:06,295
Speaker 0: Not good, you know.

822
00:51:06,476 --> 00:51:10,150
Speaker 0: at least you know, the cooking master boy was sort of like wheat bread, you know.

823
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:15,277
Speaker 0: It's like familiar seen it before but has a flavor this Flavorless.

824
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:15,983
Speaker 0: no good.

825
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:18,217
Speaker 1: Oh So the director.

826
00:51:18,237 --> 00:51:22,097
Speaker 1: I was just poking around at what the guy who directed this monstrosity generic show.

827
00:51:22,117 --> 00:51:27,743
Speaker 1: because usually when we see a show like this I'll look at the director and it'll be like generic guy.

828
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:29,469
Speaker 1: What did a bunch of generic stuff?

829
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:37,161
Speaker 1: Mmm, granted the person who did the original concept for cooking boy did to manga One of which is called tenchi.

830
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:38,670
Speaker 1: No fry pan.

831
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:41,859
Speaker 1: I'm all about that.

832
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,227
Speaker 0: tenchi no fry pan.

833
00:51:43,248 --> 00:51:43,610
Speaker 0: That's much.

834
00:51:45,592 --> 00:51:48,410
Speaker 0: That's a lot better than a lot of the other cooking show names out there.

835
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:49,754
Speaker 0: I mean even like iron wok.

836
00:51:49,795 --> 00:51:53,667
Speaker 0: Jan doesn't compare to but tenchi no fry pan, but it's a row.

837
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:56,636
Speaker 1: Kawasaki Directed this monstrosity.

838
00:51:56,736 --> 00:52:00,586
Speaker 1: He also did the chrono trigger OAV, which I heard was not good.

839
00:52:00,606 --> 00:52:06,262
Speaker 0: I Heard it was terrible licensed by royalty, which was not good that show.

840
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,770
Speaker 1: I thought that show might have been so much potential.

841
00:52:10,972 --> 00:52:13,719
Speaker 1: The cover of the first DVD had a lot of 10.

842
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:14,502
Speaker 0: that's correct.

843
00:52:15,284 --> 00:52:17,350
Speaker 0: the cover art on the DVD had potential.

844
00:52:17,451 --> 00:52:22,733
Speaker 1: I saw that and I thought is this gonna be another Read or die?

845
00:52:23,255 --> 00:52:24,419
Speaker 0: no, sorry bad.

846
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:34,267
Speaker 1: No, he was the assistant director for please save my earth Which is weird because that show was like, I don't know weird and I don't want to say good But I kind of liked it because it was weird.

847
00:52:35,232 --> 00:52:36,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess it's good to.

848
00:52:36,697 --> 00:52:43,138
Speaker 0: this show exists, you know, and that I'll remember it because usually you know You think of all these stereotypical anime things, right?

849
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:46,970
Speaker 0: Okay, we're saying that chrome shelled reggios is stereotypical and white bread, right?

850
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:51,170
Speaker 0: Which in cliche which means that the things it's doing have been done a million times before right?

851
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,176
Speaker 0: What show has done these things before?

852
00:52:53,578 --> 00:52:54,643
Speaker 0: what name the show?

853
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:56,170
Speaker 1: I couldn't tell you, right?

854
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:01,493
Speaker 0: So now we have the show and someone when we find the cliche things we can say chrome shelled reggios That's the cliche.

855
00:53:01,513 --> 00:53:01,975
Speaker 0: That's the show.

856
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:02,758
Speaker 0: That's the cliches.

857
00:53:02,899 --> 00:53:05,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are so many shows and I forget the names.

858
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,610
Speaker 1: I mean, what was that show we watched where?

859
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:10,946
Speaker 1: It was almost the same.

860
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,609
Speaker 1: Remember we watch shows that are almost the exact same goddamn show.

861
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:22,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have like it'd be tough to tell them apart like or remember coyote Ragtime show.

862
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:29,036
Speaker 0: that was yeah that that was but that had Sutton - it had the fact that like 11 maids Parachuted in from the sky.

863
00:53:29,056 --> 00:53:31,526
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah that one before that point.

864
00:53:31,546 --> 00:53:33,032
Speaker 0: Oh, that's right I was alright.

865
00:53:33,072 --> 00:53:33,996
Speaker 0: Cody ragtime show.

866
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:40,850
Speaker 0: you said Cody ragtime show, but I thought about cause the door de la bruja Oh, which was just noir three exactly just as bad.

867
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:45,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, but yeah Cody ragtime show was stereotypical but in a in a different way.

868
00:53:46,032 --> 00:53:55,750
Speaker 1: It had more going on than chrome shelled reggios, but what this guy did do this interesting I got to see which episodes those were but he directed four episodes in get sack second gig.

869
00:53:56,392 --> 00:54:00,290
Speaker 0: He actually directed for the episode episode director for four episodes.

870
00:54:00,712 --> 00:54:03,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, but episode director is not the same as director direct.

871
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,615
Speaker 1: But that means that I got.

872
00:54:04,676 --> 00:54:07,450
Speaker 1: we got to watch those episodes and see if there's any of him in them.

873
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,798
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm curious.

874
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:12,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, you can't give the director all the credit either.

875
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,034
Speaker 0: I mean who wrote?

876
00:54:13,074 --> 00:54:13,598
Speaker 0: who wrote this.

877
00:54:13,698 --> 00:54:14,665
