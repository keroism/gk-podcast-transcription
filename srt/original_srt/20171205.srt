1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,880
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, December 5th, 2017.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,402
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:21,070
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight 1846 the race for the Midwest.

4
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:25,418
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:27,545
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, we're back.

6
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:29,793
Speaker 0: We actually had some fun times just now.

7
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:34,909
Speaker 0: so I got a brand new opening bit basically in the last episode of geek nights.

8
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:44,039
Speaker 0: anyone who's watching the live stream might have noticed that After like three chords the show Scott just got really quiet for a while and then he got loud again.

9
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:49,780
Speaker 1: So how come you can't just set up the audio equipment perfectly one time and leave it that way forever?

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,684
Speaker 1: Why are you gonna mess with it?

11
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:51,588
Speaker 0: So I didn't mess with it.

12
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:54,702
Speaker 0: It has been the same for years Uh-huh.

13
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,348
Speaker 0: I had not touched it at all.

14
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:56,609
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

15
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,240
Speaker 0: And then after you left I was like, huh, that's weird.

16
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:06,121
Speaker 0: So I corrected it for that because the raw audio goes into like the computer and what's going out to the live stream is actually Something.

17
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,246
Speaker 0: it's like a different pipeline.

18
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:08,972
Speaker 0: So they're independent of one another.

19
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:09,755
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:20,800
Speaker 0: So basically Previously the last time that this happened I identified an XLR cable that was legit bad and I threw it away and I replaced it with a new XLR cable.

21
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:28,940
Speaker 0: It seems like the port Scott was plugged into is also having a problem Mm-hmm as Scott saw me test and go hey something's wrong here.

22
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,560
Speaker 1: But you plugged your microphone in port 2 and it looked like it was working.

23
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:39,960
Speaker 0: it was but what you didn't hear because I got these headphones on is There was a really weird crackling sound and I would cut out and get quiet.

24
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,260
Speaker 0: I thought you the crackling was in the compressor area that it was in that compressor pipeline because that's a different pipeline.

25
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:51,278
Speaker 0: So when I monitored that that crackle went away when I removed this port from the equation.

26
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:51,779
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

27
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:56,800
Speaker 0: So the plot thickens, but I don't want to replace this mixer because I really like this mixer.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,286
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna have to investigate that port.

29
00:01:58,507 --> 00:01:59,692
Speaker 1: get your rice krispies outta here.

30
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:04,126
Speaker 0: The thing is remember this mixer is The firewire only one.

31
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:06,374
Speaker 0: so I kind of want to go USB.

32
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:07,438
Speaker 1: no, it's your money's.

33
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,651
Speaker 0: well The thing is I don't want to replace this mixer unless it's dead.

34
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:12,273
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

35
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:13,858
Speaker 0: So I got four ports.

36
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:14,340
Speaker 1: rim loves.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,046
Speaker 1: This is a another situation.

38
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,511
Speaker 1: room is gonna break something on purpose.

39
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:21,820
Speaker 0: to feel not bad about buying a new thing I do not want to buy a new mixer.

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,664
Speaker 0: This mix is great.

41
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:26,360
Speaker 0: And actually as far as I can tell all the good mixers are also firewire.

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,887
Speaker 0: So I can't even achieve what I wanted.

43
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:28,429
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:30,920
Speaker 0: So we'll see that's neither here nor there.

45
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,891
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that more on Monday when I'll figure out.

46
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,420
Speaker 0: we'll do a Monday show on QA.

47
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,372
Speaker 0: We'll talk about the mark 14 torpedo.

48
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:41,116
Speaker 1: So this is just some tiny gaming news is going down right.

49
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:46,760
Speaker 1: on Thursday the hearthstone expansion comes out and it's gonna have.

50
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:51,680
Speaker 1: You know, I'm not gonna encourage people to go spend their money on digital cards.

51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:03:08,451
Speaker 1: You're better off spending your money on real cards first, right if you're gonna do collectible cards Magic cards, they're adding a single-player Free-to-play mode that is actually has significant play and replay value So and you don't have to pay a single dime for that.

52
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,639
Speaker 1: So why not check it out?

53
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,368
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, if you play hearthstone, I uh Play hearthstone.

54
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:15,294
Speaker 1: It's like you could.

55
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:16,120
Speaker 1: just it has this freeze.

56
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,719
Speaker 1: They're gonna add a free single-player mode that is worth playing and worth, you know, like into play until you get bored of it.

57
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:30,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I kind of avoided Going down the road of hearthstone because between that and overwatch I can really only have one game that I play every day.

58
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:31,965
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean you only.

59
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:34,860
Speaker 1: I only played every day for like 30 minutes less.

60
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,391
Speaker 0: Yeah, I play overwatch every day for like an hour pretty much.

61
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:38,692
Speaker 0: Yeah.

62
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,960
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm still only like gold here.

63
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:47,460
Speaker 1: So speaking of overwatch your you know We've been waiting for them to actually have this league with teams that are actually located in cities.

64
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:55,880
Speaker 1: So we can have our New York eSports team for finally And I guess tomorrow the jerseys go on sale, so we'll see if they're ugly or not.

65
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,206
Speaker 1: I imagine they will be.

66
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:58,995
Speaker 0: it better say New York something's.

67
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:02,699
Speaker 1: yeah, but you know Maybe it'll be good enough to buy but I doubt it.

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,574
Speaker 1: But if it is I will but probably won't.

69
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:10,780
Speaker 0: I do Appreciate the fact that the teams have in-game jerseys for all the characters - I think you got to pay for those.

70
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:11,483
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

71
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:12,406
Speaker 0: Yeah you but if you're.

72
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:15,620
Speaker 0: but if you're the team you wear your jersey in the game.

73
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:19,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, wouldn't that be weird if you were playing like hockey online and you couldn't wear Rangers Jersey hundred?

74
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:36,114
Speaker 0: or you're watching a real NHL game back in the future when the NHL is replaced by nothing but eSports and like the equivalent of grab nurse Zuccarello is Wearing like a dragon mask and boffer shoes and carrying a broom instead of a hockey stick.

75
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:38,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's not go to that world.

76
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:49,160
Speaker 0: There is actually some pretty big news and we're not gonna be able to talk about the full extent of what this means But it's something I want to bring up today.

77
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:53,024
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was this was so awesome when I saw it and I was like, whoa What have I been missing out on?

78
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:57,920
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read the headline on Ars Technica because you get literally summarized as my full sentiment.

79
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:04,960
Speaker 0: Yeah formula one eSports now more exciting than the real thing and that's a problem.

80
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:16,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's always been this formula one racing games even back going back like the Gameboy, but this There's an official f1 game that like is licensed and has all the actual drivers and cars in it.

81
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:22,107
Speaker 1: That's been coming up for quite a few years and I never bought it because every year it would come out and I say Ooh, that looks really cool.

82
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,200
Speaker 1: But how much am I actually gonna play it?

83
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,044
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's a real expensive.

84
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:29,212
Speaker 0: and also I've played realistic driving simulators before.

85
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:33,420
Speaker 0: I suck ass at the very simulator of how many ways Rim can die, right?

86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,865
Speaker 1: It's definitely a sim like.

87
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:47,607
Speaker 1: it tries to be super accurate to the real world like you could practice driving with it right if you get a wheel in pedals and Then it would get cheap and I'd be like, ooh, and then the new one would come out like wow I don't want to buy the old one.

88
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:49,980
Speaker 1: Oh, it's only worth it to get the new one, but no one's expenses.

89
00:05:50,100 --> 00:06:05,637
Speaker 1: I never played it, but apparently it's actually an eSport like playing this game and Because it doesn't have any even though it's modeled on the real world formula one It's not constrained by real the real world.

90
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:10,836
Speaker 1: in the same way It's still a simulation and I'm not sure exactly how which parts are accurate and which parts aren't.

91
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:14,634
Speaker 1: but like they had to go in They were playing with realistic damage on.

92
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,539
Speaker 1: I noticed that part.

93
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:20,457
Speaker 1: Yeah But I don't know if like are the cars actually faster than is like hurt you to get in one car.

94
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,160
Speaker 1: That's faster?

95
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,083
Speaker 1: Well, here's here's one.

96
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:25,897
Speaker 0: Here's a very interesting example of where this could go.

97
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:35,202
Speaker 0: So One of the most exciting things about Formula One would be the ridiculously dangerous nonsense that they ban because it's too dangerous people to drive Mm-hmm.

98
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:39,160
Speaker 0: with an eSport of Formula One you could bring back ground effect.

99
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,224
Speaker 1: There's no reason to not.

100
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:45,611
Speaker 1: the thing is if you're gonna have an eSport that's a racing game straight up You might as well just have f-zero.

101
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,718
Speaker 1: Why have I have f1?

102
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,940
Speaker 0: Well, so that the here's the interesting like overlap between just go to f-zero.

103
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:57,700
Speaker 0: Right now f1 as a real physical sport has a lot of like cultural cachet.

104
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:13,880
Speaker 0: Yeah There's a lot of reasons to be excited about it and to be able to be follow and be interested in it but as a pure spectator The graphics and the way it plays out if you watch someone playing the eSport version It could be an identical experience.

105
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:24,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, watching the eSport f1 was not very different than watching the real one except obviously you can tell it's not the real world Even though it still looks incredible, but it looks pretty close.

106
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,920
Speaker 0: Like if you had not a great TV, they look the same.

107
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,735
Speaker 1: Yes, also, uh, you know, no fuel is being consumed.

108
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:35,106
Speaker 1: There's no environmental damage Okay But it's just a lot shorter.

109
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,217
Speaker 1: They don't run like a you know, 30 whatever 60 laughs.

110
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:39,361
Speaker 1: however many laps it is Right.

111
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,164
Speaker 1: It was really quick.

112
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:48,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was also a lot more exciting and part of that It was definitely one of the most exciting f1 races I've seen recently.

113
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:53,060
Speaker 0: the people racing can take The risks that a human might not take in a real race.

114
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:57,880
Speaker 0: They could also have a lot more races because you don't need all this physical infrastructure to make them happen.

115
00:07:58,362 --> 00:07:59,406
Speaker 0: It's a lot more accessible.

116
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:02,939
Speaker 0: you can you can do a lot of stuff to make it interesting.

117
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:16,958
Speaker 0: and the problem part is that For the average consumer like someone who wants to watch f1, but isn't like a hyper purist It's a better experience than literally every way Most people cannot go see f1.

118
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,204
Speaker 0: The fact that I have seen f1 races in person is a position of privilege and even then I only saw them because someone else Paid for it.

119
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:26,153
Speaker 1: It's also because it's shorter.

120
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,218
Speaker 1: It's a lot less time-consuming.

121
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,293
Speaker 1: Yeah The length of that race is the amount is like.

122
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:41,955
Speaker 1: I do like f1 But I don't like it enough to wake up early on every Sunday morning and watch a race for hours But I like it enough to watch one of these maybe once a week once a month for 15 20 minutes.

123
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:52,222
Speaker 0: if this continues eSports of Physical car racing that are close enough for the layman are gonna be the kind of thing I would watch.

124
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:57,480
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm gonna go look for like competitive for the Gran Turismo and you know, see what's up with that.

125
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,429
Speaker 1: Right, there must be a scene and it's like.

126
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,840
Speaker 1: that's a scene I could spectate and be into if it's good.

127
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:05,351
Speaker 1: But really let's just fast forward and get to f0 already.

128
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:06,575
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's the problem?

129
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:07,418
Speaker 1: What's holding you up?

130
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:20,049
Speaker 1: Make an f0 that controls realistically and is very difficult so that it can become an e-sport But still have loop-de-loops and jumps and ridiculous cars because hey There's no constraints of the real world in there.

131
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,895
Speaker 1: make it go like 10,000 miles an hour.

132
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:22,778
Speaker 0: who gives it stunts 4d.

133
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,615
Speaker 0: That's where we'll get down the road.

134
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:26,784
Speaker 0: Whatever Down the road.

135
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:36,640
Speaker 0: All right, so it'll be a race between this and the other crazy side of that Which is the drone racing of robot cars in the real world controlled by people who are not in them.

136
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:45,319
Speaker 1: Well, let's just fast forward again and have robot AI's controlling e-sport cars But the the the driving point so it becomes a pretty good addition.

137
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,055
Speaker 1: Yeah the dry

138
00:09:46,902 --> 00:10:01,180
Speaker 0: the driving point of all this the thing that you really need to think about let's simmer in your head for like when we talk About this in more depth in the future Is that the only thing that matters for the like future of a sport is the spectator?

139
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,003
Speaker 0: Experience.

140
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:03,533
Speaker 0: is it exciting?

141
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:04,600
Speaker 0: Is it accessible?

142
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,619
Speaker 0: And eSports are already on track to be better than most real sports at both of those things.

143
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:32,059
Speaker 0: Mmm, that is that is the important part This news is is a very important thing that not a lot of people are talking about The direct competition between traditional sports and eSports and how eSports are well positioned to destroy the former Mm-hmm, and if you think that isn't true as we like to say boxing used to be literally the most popular sport on earth.

144
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:34,420
Speaker 0: Where is it now going?

145
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:42,199
Speaker 0: occasionally on a hockey field Occasionally on the ice Sure, so you got some other news.

146
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,205
Speaker 1: Yeah So it also sports news.

147
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:51,692
Speaker 1: everybody knows that in previous Olympic and other international sporting competitions Russia do some big-time cheating action.

148
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:53,880
Speaker 0: and this isn't just like an individual player cheating.

149
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:57,660
Speaker 0: This is like a speculation like oh that country is cheating.

150
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:10,820
Speaker 1: This was organized like organized across-the-board cheating like almost every Russian athlete was probably Government-assisted big-time doping organized by their you know whatnot, right?

151
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,580
Speaker 1: It was like, you know an epidemic not like oh one individual from your country on their own cheated.

152
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:16,901
Speaker 1: It's like.

153
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:22,860
Speaker 1: no the whole country's sporting organization got together to have a system of cheating in place.

154
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:24,568
Speaker 1: right and they were caught.

155
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:37,035
Speaker 1: they were caught so red-handed and now you know the Winter Olympics are coming up real soon in South Korea and The big news is that Russia is getting penalized and they're getting penalized for this cheating.

156
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:47,106
Speaker 1: a punishment likes the wit and this might be the greatest punishment to a sporting organization in the history of Sports like within the context of sport.

157
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:56,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's like it might be like I guess before that maybe Lance Armstrong has always you know the Tour de France is taken away.

158
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:59,280
Speaker 1: This might be a bigger punishment than that.

159
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:05,757
Speaker 1: So what they're doing is all Russian Russia cannot participate in the Olympics period.

160
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,786
Speaker 1: no Russian flags No Russian anthems.

161
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:08,772
Speaker 1: No Russian nothing.

162
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:09,094
Speaker 0: Yep.

163
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:10,120
Speaker 0: They're basically banned.

164
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:23,153
Speaker 1: However, if any athletes from Russia right want to go they can go but of course they have to be Extra-doubly triply quadruply thoroughly vetted to make sure they aren't cheating.

165
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:30,969
Speaker 1: Yep, and if they do participate They're gonna have to wear like boring generic Olympic things.

166
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,600
Speaker 0: they wear the dunce uniform.

167
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:38,080
Speaker 1: They cannot use the Russian flag right like a white like a blank white uniform with Olympic rings on it.

168
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,813
Speaker 0: They don't even get their own national anthem.

169
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:45,803
Speaker 1: No, they get the Olympic anthem, you know That one?

170
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:47,890
Speaker 1: yeah, right they don't get nothing.

171
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:48,391
Speaker 1: nothing.

172
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:53,367
Speaker 1: Russian can be at the Olympics in South Korea Which is really close to Russia geographically.

173
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:53,668
Speaker 0: Yep.

174
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:54,712
Speaker 0: This article says the best.

175
00:12:54,752 --> 00:13:00,232
Speaker 0: the IOC after completing their investigation blah blah blah Handed Russia penal is for doping so severe.

176
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:01,960
Speaker 0: They were without precedent?

177
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:02,764
Speaker 1: No, definitely.

178
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,660
Speaker 1: I said with that they've never seen penalties this severe for anyone ever.

179
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:11,643
Speaker 0: This is exactly this is the kind of penalty that I want to see in eSports - yeah, well, yeah Yeah, I want to see.

180
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:19,575
Speaker 1: you know, if you cheat if you do something wrong if you're harassing people in a game Why shouldn't the penalties be incredibly severe now?

181
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:20,660
Speaker 0: This is breaking news.

182
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:35,640
Speaker 1: We're not talking about like, you know, I'm not someone who's in favor of death penalties or lifetime prison sentences But these are penalties which like they're within the context of a game You can make them as severe as you want and they actually do work as a deterrent because it's within the context of a game.

183
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,090
Speaker 1: So why not make them ridiculously severe?

184
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,460
Speaker 0: but as this is breaking news today?

185
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,679
Speaker 0: We don't know yet how Russia has responded or will respond, right?

186
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,900
Speaker 0: Well, they didn't let their athletes attend, right?

187
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,886
Speaker 1: Is there a boycott?

188
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:48,429
Speaker 0: the Olympics?

189
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,899
Speaker 1: is there gonna be a hockey team?

190
00:13:50,201 --> 00:14:00,336
Speaker 1: That is like the Janeiro Olympic hockey team because the NHL is not going to the Olympics So it's gonna be all junior teams and supposedly KHL people would have gone and dominated.

191
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:01,279
Speaker 1: Are they gonna go?

192
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:16,672
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, right, so It'll still be great to watch some hockey's though with some swamis and some three gays and some but the two Some Canada's will especially the hockey is some check.

193
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:24,839
Speaker 0: do the hockey kids care so much about hockey that they'll go play just to play even if they don't even get to play under their own flag?

194
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:29,154
Speaker 0: and Secondarily will the Russian government even let them do that?

195
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:36,440
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, cuz I Especially because there's more to this I think you also need to be invited and you got to pass through the muster that you know.

196
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,540
Speaker 1: If you're from Russia, you're gonna have to pass a lot more qualifications and such than anyone from any other country.

197
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:44,620
Speaker 1: There is even more they'll check your PP every two hours.

198
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,232
Speaker 0: So the investigation cost the IOC over 15 million dollars.

199
00:14:48,593 --> 00:14:55,520
Speaker 0: Russia has to pay all that money before Anyone before they can even have the option of competing not under their own flag.

200
00:14:57,065 --> 00:15:07,046
Speaker 0: So I Suspect that Russia is going to tell them to eat a dick and this is gonna be a really interesting geopolitical situation Which is extra.

201
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:13,939
Speaker 0: It's not really a Tuesday show topic, but considering the current Shall we say troubles between the United States and Russia?

202
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:29,843
Speaker 0: The fact that Russia might end up boycotting current troubles You mean they be almost 50 60 year long 70 year long troubles I guess the re-emergence into the public sphere since the mid 40s troubles the Russia literally Troubles.

203
00:15:29,903 --> 00:15:33,013
Speaker 0: as old as Stalin swung the American election the wrong way.

204
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:34,900
Speaker 1: that are the same troubles.

205
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:43,240
Speaker 0: So I guess I'm gonna get to live through a cold war where Russia boycotts the Olympics already lived through cold war.

206
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:44,505
Speaker 1: We've been living it all lives.

207
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:46,413
Speaker 1: They were born in it and it hasn't ended.

208
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:48,040
Speaker 0: take to boogaloo.

209
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:49,823
Speaker 1: Cool facts.

210
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:54,155
Speaker 1: Ovechkin if he wants to almost definitely won't can go compete for Schweiss.

211
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:57,123
Speaker 1: if he wants to oh, yeah That'd be interesting.

212
00:15:57,444 --> 00:15:58,006
Speaker 1: It won't happen.

213
00:15:58,046 --> 00:15:58,246
Speaker 1: I do.

214
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:01,716
Speaker 1: well, they'll probably just stay and compete for das Kapital.

215
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:05,171
Speaker 1: I feel like Especially like you what I did there.

216
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:06,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see what you did there.

217
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:15,237
Speaker 0: I feel like if there are any Russian athletes who could compete under another flag, that would be tantamount to suicide to do so.

218
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,545
Speaker 0: Political also.

219
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,755
Speaker 1: Ovechkin is like super pro-putin.

220
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:20,760
Speaker 1: He's like Putin's biggest fan.

221
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,559
Speaker 0: Well, I either he's pro-putin or it is not safe for him to not be pro-putin.

222
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:27,265
Speaker 1: I mean he could just stay in the u.s.

223
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:28,248
Speaker 1: Isn't the go-dealing.

224
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:29,612
Speaker 0: Yeah staying in the u.s.

225
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:31,417
Speaker 0: Man always been safe.

226
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:35,714
Speaker 1: many other Russian athletes in the NHL are not pro-putin.

227
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:36,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a.

228
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:44,388
Speaker 1: It's a complex situation and also he goes out of his way to be extra pro-putin Just quietly not being anti-feud.

229
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:48,829
Speaker 0: There's a fun little bit at the end of this article - this might be even more interesting down the road.

230
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:57,500
Speaker 0: Quote Tuesday's decision could have consequences for another major sporting event scheduled be held in Russia next year's 11 billion dollar soccer World Cup.

231
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:01,520
Speaker 0: I like how the article has to specify that the World Cup is soccer.

232
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:04,960
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't think it's an issue because even if the Russians cheat they're not winning the World Cup.

233
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,928
Speaker 1: No, no, no, but they have to.

234
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:10,119
Speaker 1: they have to bribe the refs or something because their reps really control soccer.

235
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:15,099
Speaker 0: It'd be interesting if the World Cup follows suit and maybe that event moves or changes.

236
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,513
Speaker 1: Well has the as Russian soccer been cheating as much as Russian Olympics are cheating.

237
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,339
Speaker 0: I don't know different organization, right?

238
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,670
Speaker 1: You know like you know what not yeah, and I don't know.

239
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,789
Speaker 0: so it'll be interesting to see how this all shakes down because this Is Britain even qualify for the World Cup?

240
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,498
Speaker 0: Well, it's breaking news and it's night in Russia So I don't think there's even gonna be any response until tomorrow.

241
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:37,375
Speaker 1: No, it's gonna be morning there soon.

242
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:39,435
Speaker 0: Yeah We'll see how this goes.

243
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:48,040
Speaker 0: so anyway things of the day.

244
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:54,239
Speaker 0: So I was at the scojo Laura house party that Scott skipped and I played a lot of st Petersburg there.

245
00:17:54,682 --> 00:18:00,568
Speaker 0: But the night before we were doing the thing that members of the front row crew do when it's late at night We're hanging out at someone's house.

246
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:12,560
Speaker 0: We were looking at random YouTube videos Yeah random YouTube videos and we kept seeing this one video recommended and It was like it looked like this guy who had made a lot of chicken fingers.

247
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:20,562
Speaker 0: We don't really think much about it But eventually we clicked on it and the video was from this channel called grandpa kitchen Mm-hmm.

248
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:26,397
Speaker 0: The channel has a lot of videos and some of the other videos involve such things as good at cooking.

249
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:27,762
Speaker 0: making a 1,000 egg curry.

250
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:35,169
Speaker 1: whoa Followed immediately never made curry with any egg.

251
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:40,350
Speaker 0: the next video was a recipe that involved him using 2,000 eggs.

252
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:44,659
Speaker 1: All right Every recipe is 1,000 eggs more than the last one.

253
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,185
Speaker 0: So I'm not gonna.

254
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:48,010
Speaker 0: basically one of them was he just makes pancakes.

255
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:49,254
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

256
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:50,478
Speaker 0: Where those pancakes?

257
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:51,140
Speaker 0: those look so good.

258
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,150
Speaker 0: The problem was we started watching this video.

259
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,220
Speaker 1: How could I go if he's making something with that many eggs?

260
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,631
Speaker 1: It's got to be enough food to go around.

261
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,619
Speaker 1: Can I go eat with grandpa?

262
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,551
Speaker 0: Ah, so these videos are long and we watch many.

263
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:04,780
Speaker 0: we stayed up way late watching these videos to their conclusion.

264
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:13,796
Speaker 0: And I'm gonna warn you right now if you watch this video You're going to be desperate to eat the thing that he made and it's gonna be a problem for you.

265
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:15,060
Speaker 0: and we were in, Pennsylvania.

266
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:20,980
Speaker 0: So there was no way for us to in fact get chicken fingers or pancakes at 3 in the morning.

267
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:21,931
Speaker 1: No, I can do that.

268
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,559
Speaker 1: I can do that right now.

269
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,820
Speaker 0: So you realize the next morning we all got up early and went to a diner to eat pancakes because otherwise we couldn't made it.

270
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:30,720
Speaker 0: No, so this video I'm gonna link to is the chicken fingers one.

271
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:40,440
Speaker 0: these look like the best chicken fingers anyone's ever made on earth and Grandpa is in India and he cooks these giant meals for orphans.

272
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:54,734
Speaker 0: Oh That's why he's got a thousand eggs and the videos are just very long procedural videos of him cooking in the woods with very simple tools Amazing recipes in quantity and the first half of every video.

273
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:56,660
Speaker 1: Why don't we make grandpa's chicken fingers?

274
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:58,385
Speaker 0: I want to make grandpa's chicken fingers.

275
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,074
Speaker 0: In fact, I plan to make grandpa's chicken fingers.

276
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:02,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, they look pretty straightforward.

277
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:04,460
Speaker 0: They look so good.

278
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:13,367
Speaker 0: So you watch it make these crazy recipes and then the end of every video is all the orphans Eating the food and it looks fantastic.

279
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:17,360
Speaker 0: This channel is just amazing to watch when you want something kind of chill and low-key.

280
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,436
Speaker 0: It's it's why I think it's just my top ten of favorite things that I've ever found.

281
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:22,140
Speaker 1: that reminds me.

282
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,475
Speaker 1: There's a. there's a I think I've told you before but I don't know the listeners know.

283
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:30,768
Speaker 1: there's a Korean cooking show I watch occasionally called please take care of my Refrigerator and I don't want it.

284
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:45,451
Speaker 1: to explain the entire concept of the show would take a while but basically celebrities bring their actual Refrigerators to the show and a bunch of chefs compete to see which food they can make from the celebrities fridge Right and which and the celebrity decides which one they like most.

285
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:46,835
Speaker 0: it's always celebrity shows up.

286
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,119
Speaker 0: There's just beer and like.

287
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,560
Speaker 1: Sometimes there is but basically it's an excuse to for the celebrity to promote their stuff whatever they're up to.

288
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,840
Speaker 1: Right for that for you to see some cool cooking and also to enjoy a lot of banter between the chefs and the celebrities.

289
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:05,160
Speaker 1: Right, but usually the episodes are split over two weeks.

290
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,980
Speaker 1: They'll have like one recording session with two celebrities.

291
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,880
Speaker 1: It's one celebrities meals get cooked the first episode and then the week later you see the other celebrity right getting cooked for right?

292
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:25,759
Speaker 1: But this week and next week or truly special The it was the first time I've seen a chef not from Korea on the show.

293
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:32,954
Speaker 1: the famous Most maybe most famous chef on earth the Gordon Ramsay appeared on this show.

294
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:35,020
Speaker 0: Ha I should watch that one episode.

295
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,865
Speaker 1: He's gonna cook next week.

296
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:41,217
Speaker 1: He's got 15 minutes to cook something from a celebrity Korean celebrities fridge.

297
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:42,260
Speaker 0: whose fridge is it?

298
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,343
Speaker 1: I don't know who is it is.

299
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:43,906
Speaker 1: I didn't watch.

300
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:45,974
Speaker 1: Okay, but I just I'm gonna watch.

301
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:47,180
Speaker 1: so oh man.

302
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:50,820
Speaker 0: So the only other thing about this videos is want to point out that's cool.

303
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,739
Speaker 0: Is that he makes these giant recipes with a very simple and limited set of tools?

304
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,779
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and that is part of why it's so fascinating to watch the entire thing.

305
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:02,751
Speaker 1: Anyway, so my actual thing of the day.

306
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:19,610
Speaker 1: another excellent Craftsman, I guess you could say artisan artisan here is a man who is I guess his job is exterminator and He is called in for this hornet's nest in someone's shed and the hornet's nest is like engulfed.

307
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:24,835
Speaker 1: You know many things in the shed like this is some Right here.

308
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:31,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a huge ass hornet's nest and he removes it with the greatest of ease without getting stung even once.

309
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,856
Speaker 0: Well, he's basically wearing like armor.

310
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:36,184
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you got to check out this hornet's nest.

311
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:42,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's got basically got a GoPro with him I assume as a GoPro while he's a De-nesting the shed.

312
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:47,190
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say if one how did these people let their shed get to this state?

313
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:54,490
Speaker 1: I don't know, but it's also kind of awesome because when he rips the hive out of there You can see all the queens at the bottom and stuff and it's like oh man.

314
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:57,041
Speaker 1: But if I were them, it's like a whole bunch of queens.

315
00:22:57,081 --> 00:22:58,990
Speaker 0: I would just burn the shed down and start over.

316
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,675
Speaker 1: Well, but this guy got their stuff in there.

317
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:02,020
Speaker 0: Yeah a bunch of garbage.

Speaker 0: They got this faded-ass basketball.

320
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:12,019
Speaker 0: They got this pile of what looks like all their garden tools, you know Just it's a shed filled with mostly garbage.

321
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,404
Speaker 0: and look look at the super soaker.

322
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:15,210
Speaker 0: That looks like a vintage super soaker.

323
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,933
Speaker 1: Oh, man, I want it.

324
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:18,524
Speaker 0: I don't think I think it's off-brand actually.

325
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:19,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

326
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:20,070
Speaker 1: the colors are backwards.

327
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not a super circuit 50.

328
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,629
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is the video still awesome.

329
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:27,927
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, it is the calm before the storm.

330
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:35,446
Speaker 0: We are home Just you know making geek night stuff, but coming up real soon is both mag fest and packs.

335
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:50,819
Speaker 0: It's more fun than packs East.

336
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:51,562
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna say it.

337
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:57,865
Speaker 0: I'm sorry pecs East is true And we're gonna be there on Friday for that's just like saying well Platinum's worth more than gold.

338
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, I ain't scoffing at gold I just I like platinum more.

339
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,197
Speaker 0: Yeah Got some electrum.

340
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,423
Speaker 0: That's that's packs.

341
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,689
Speaker 0: So pack sauce is the electrum.

Speaker 0: So we're gonna be there at 4 p.m.

343
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:11,690
Speaker 0: Doing a brand new panel a Scott panel balance in game design.

344
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,759
Speaker 0: It's looking pretty good like 30% done.

345
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,450
Speaker 0: Yep At mag fast, we're gonna be doing a bunch of panels.

346
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:25,965
Speaker 0: We're doing probably three with the mages one of which is a different version of this balance panel where we might have dr Pat hazard honors someone of his caliber with us.

347
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:26,910
Speaker 1: What else do I have to do there?

348
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,481
Speaker 1: What else is gonna pull me away from my dig dug machine?

349
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:31,168
Speaker 0: I forget what panels I put in.

350
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:32,954
Speaker 0: I gotta go I'm also.

351
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,240
Speaker 0: I put in a brand new one.

352
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,209
Speaker 0: Not a mages panel, but a regular panel.

353
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:41,450
Speaker 1: Top 40 tabletop games you should play and you're gonna come up with this list on your own.

354
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,610
Speaker 1: I already started writing it because I saw make a Google Doc so I can edit your incorrect list.

355
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:51,689
Speaker 0: Ah, so I saw someone else do a similar talk about games as a whole and the angle wasn't the best.

356
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:52,713
Speaker 0: 40.

357
00:24:52,713 --> 00:24:55,207
Speaker 0: The angle is also not the most important.

358
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:56,393
Speaker 0: 40.

359
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:57,297
Speaker 1: Cover all the bases.

360
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,140
Speaker 0: 40 it's.

361
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:04,928
Speaker 0: if you've played these 40 tabletop games You will be a player of games and have gnosis about tabletop gaming.

362
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:05,430
Speaker 1: That's right.

363
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,708
Speaker 1: so if there's even a game like pandemic will make that list and you basically you look at a category.

364
00:25:09,728 --> 00:25:18,862
Speaker 1: you look at every Category of games right the 40 most important types of game and you pick the iconic game from each of those guys Not the first one not the best one.

365
00:25:18,882 --> 00:25:20,110
Speaker 0: I don't illustrate.

366
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:32,170
Speaker 1: I don't like co-op solitaire pretend garbo garbo games But you must play one of them to understand them and pandemic is the one Yep, and you have to play Hanabi to understand why that was a garbo Yep.

367
00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:39,757
Speaker 0: and if basically I want to try this panel out at magfest and then we'll probably tweak the list and I think we're gonna do It at paxies like legit.

368
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:40,982
Speaker 0: That's my plan.

369
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:49,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a cool one and I'm doing Magfest has a Saturday morning cartoons panel block where they do a bunch of this fun Saturday morning cartoon type stuff.

370
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:52,185
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna do the anime openers thing at 8 a.m.

371
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:52,789
Speaker 0: On Saturday.

372
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:54,431
Speaker 0: Cuz.

373
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:56,057
Speaker 0: apparently there's a big crowd of people.

374
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,642
Speaker 1: look at the free badge.

375
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:59,027
Speaker 1: cuz I'm paying for one.

376
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:01,198
Speaker 1: Yeah And I didn't pay for one.

377
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:03,960
Speaker 1: It would be sad if I showed up and couldn't get in I would make.

378
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,720
Speaker 0: this is one of the rare cons I would pay to go to if I were not a guest.

379
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:10,632
Speaker 1: I might but I just want to make sure I'm doing My.

380
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:11,134
Speaker 0: are you kidding?

381
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:13,283
Speaker 0: You would skip magfest for the like.

382
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:14,469
Speaker 0: how much does the badge even cost?

383
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:14,750
Speaker 0: 50 bucks?

384
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,610
Speaker 1: I don't know, but I'm just saying I also know for the free badge, right?

385
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,403
Speaker 1: Cuz I don't have to fill any other forms or anything.

386
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:20,270
Speaker 0: I don't believe so.

387
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,990
Speaker 0: We should just be some follow-up link or something should be fine.

388
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:29,306
Speaker 0: I just want to confirm it because times getting the consternation right now is making sure all the panelists have hotel rooms We don't need to worry about because we just get our own.

389
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:30,252
Speaker 0: That's right I don't get.

390
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:33,186
Speaker 0: I don't try to get into like the weird hotel room.

391
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:37,690
Speaker 0: We don't got our thing Nope, so yeah, we will be at packs on pec south now pecs unplugged.

392
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,466
Speaker 0: We were there and mag fest and pax East is like not too long after that.

393
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:43,690
Speaker 0: We will be there two months.

394
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:52,762
Speaker 0: so if you had to Describe a game that most people would assume that rim and scott would have no interest in 1846 should be near the top of that list.

395
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:54,793
Speaker 1: No, I mean, it's not a game We have no interest in.

396
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:57,523
Speaker 1: it's one of those like stereotypical games.

397
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,570
Speaker 1: We sort of always jokingly referred to right?

398
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:06,848
Speaker 1: It's like we laugh about like aha train game that uses crayons or grog nard war game or train game Where you only take four turns?

399
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:17,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is this is a you know It's stereotypical grog nard train game that we sort of you know The kind that you see in the game store and you look at and you go I know that kind of game and then you don't ever play it.

400
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:22,150
Speaker 0: You very rarely see people playing these kinds of games and when you do they tend to fit certain stereotypes.

401
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:24,981
Speaker 0: Yes games tend to take a very long time.

402
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:32,186
Speaker 0: The games tend to be more Simulatory than the sort of elegant machine building type games.

403
00:27:32,227 --> 00:27:43,566
Speaker 0: We tend to prefer They tend to be more experiences where you explore a set of complex mechanics Rather than a game where you read the rules and already have a pretty good heuristic about what to do.

404
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:51,229
Speaker 1: They also Accurately represent true historical events at least related to trains in this case so that you can you know learn.

405
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:57,770
Speaker 1: So someone who's a nerd about old trains would like get jollies playing this game right regardless of the winning and losing factor.

406
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:05,417
Speaker 0: now What's funny is that even games like not age of steam but railroad tycoon like the baby version That game all the cars.

407
00:28:05,437 --> 00:28:12,587
Speaker 0: when you buy trains they have that numerical like 422 like this is a 422 train and because of that I actually know what that means.

408
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:13,370
Speaker 1: I don't know what that means.

409
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,645
Speaker 0: It's those guide wheels versus drive wheels versus those trailing wheels.

410
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:18,970
Speaker 0: how many of each there are?

411
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,858
Speaker 1: Okay, and I mean only on the locomotive.

412
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:24,047
Speaker 1: that all the cars but yeah the locomotive itself.

413
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:27,984
Speaker 0: Yeah, but 1846 has that amped up to 11.

414
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:28,185
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

415
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:30,860
Speaker 0: So this game was presented.

416
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,730
Speaker 0: basically our friends Chris and Anthony like this game.

417
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:40,197
Speaker 1: They played it and well, there's a whole series of 18xx games that are all train games from different Geographies and areas.

418
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:41,321
Speaker 1: like is mostly in the u.s.

419
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:43,530
Speaker 1: But I assume they've also got euro rails and stuff like that.

420
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:53,432
Speaker 1: but you know that are you know, so this one is about the Midwest and of course the year 1846 like what was happening with train companies there and then yep And apparently the.

421
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:56,963
Speaker 0: I have not looked at these other games, but I've learned a little bit about them.

422
00:28:57,465 --> 00:29:11,570
Speaker 0: all the other 18 Dot-dot games are very similar but have like soul crushingly Esoteric differences or like very specific nuances that make them completely different game, right?

423
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:19,250
Speaker 1: So it's like you could learn one and then easily learn to play another one in a short amount of time Once you've learned one, but there will be significant differences.

424
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,279
Speaker 1: You'll probably not win because you like you'll mess those up right because.

425
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:29,410
Speaker 1: but I guess if you're super studied on train history Maybe you'll just anticipate those differences because they match real-world event.

426
00:29:29,452 --> 00:29:35,466
Speaker 0: Yeah like you might know about One of the like small railroads like it like the Erie line or something and what happened to it.

427
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:41,610
Speaker 1: and then you when you see What happens to in the game like oh it makes perfect sense Cuz actually there is this this line that used to go around Lake Erie.

428
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:44,910
Speaker 0: It's not in this game, but it is a train line.

429
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,297
Speaker 0: I know a lot about what.

430
00:29:46,337 --> 00:29:48,286
Speaker 1: was it there in 1846 or before then or after then?

431
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,096
Speaker 0: Uh, I think it was around.

432
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:51,939
Speaker 0: it was around before then.

433
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,481
Speaker 0: Definitely.

434
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:53,907
Speaker 0: It just does not play in the 1846 game.

435
00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,850
Speaker 0: I think it's heyday was earlier, but I know stuff about it because it's intrinsically tied to the history of Cedar Point anyway.

436
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:11,664
Speaker 0: So yeah, but the other interesting thing about this game like the the the core point I want to get out in the review before getting the details is that We both enjoy it.

437
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:23,410
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And I did not expect to feel the desire to not only play it but to play it again And having played it twice to actually really want to play it a third time.

438
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:27,110
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing is like I don't Super want to play it, right?

439
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:33,737
Speaker 1: But it's like I totally will play it and it's sort of on this borderline where it's like it's got a lot of action Right.

440
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,589
Speaker 1: One thing I really like about it Is that even if you're losing and getting your ass kicked like you still do stuff.

441
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:40,335
Speaker 0: There is an exception to that.

442
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:50,269
Speaker 0: Amanda got into a specific situation where she was pushed to bankruptcy by Nonsense and literally could not do anything meaningful for many turns in a row.

443
00:30:50,873 --> 00:30:52,220
Speaker 1: But it's really hard to not do.

444
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,522
Speaker 1: it was.

445
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:57,290
Speaker 0: it was such a like crazy Situation a turn of events that happened that she had no control over.

446
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:03,017
Speaker 1: It's also like a lot is a lot of even though the rules are sort of esoteric There's a lot of flexibility and what you can do.

447
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:07,151
Speaker 1: and yeah terms of like stock trading and train building and train buying it's like.

448
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:18,911
Speaker 0: so there's a bunch of very fiddly specific arbitrary seeming exceptions to general rules, but they are To do.

449
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:27,069
Speaker 0: then the games are I would complain about that like there's limits on how many stock certificates you can own But that doesn't really come into play until the very end of the game.

450
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:33,769
Speaker 0: So even though that is an arbitrary distinction It is not something that I bumped into in the course of natural play anyway.

451
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:37,806
Speaker 1: So the main thing is like the game takes a little while to play.

452
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:38,750
Speaker 1: it takes a few hours.

453
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:42,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can play fast if you've got skills and help and experience.

454
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:48,704
Speaker 1: But it still takes a while no matter what the game is sort of on this border Between where it takes too long.

455
00:31:48,744 --> 00:31:49,549
Speaker 1: It's not worth it.

456
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:51,839
Speaker 1: If it was shorter, it would be like the best game ever.

457
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,376
Speaker 1: but it's not so long like Monopoly long You want to kill yourself?

458
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,040
Speaker 1: It's like, okay.

459
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:57,630
Speaker 1: I put the time aside.

460
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:02,605
Speaker 1: It's still and unlike say Eclipse where there's a lot of time sitting doing nothing.

461
00:32:02,885 --> 00:32:06,758
Speaker 1: You're doing stuff the whole time You don't you know, I haven't gotten bored and distracted.

462
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:15,797
Speaker 1: usually when there's an Eclipse playing Eclipse takes as long or longer But I'll spend a lot of time during an Eclipse game sitting around being bored Waiting for my turn in this.

463
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:18,486
Speaker 1: that's almost never happens, right either either.

464
00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:26,165
Speaker 0: while I'm waiting for my turn I'm thinking about like Stock value and like could I pull this off over the next few turns and wonder what Scott's gonna do?

465
00:32:26,506 --> 00:32:29,256
Speaker 0: or I'm watching some drama Unfold in the stock market.

466
00:32:29,377 --> 00:32:32,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you can only do a very small number of things on your turn.

467
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:38,050
Speaker 1: So the the rounds go around very quickly and then everyone sort of calculates simultaneously.

468
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:45,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, so without that downtime like you're into it for those hours You're actually probably in sort of play per time.

469
00:32:45,232 --> 00:32:57,584
Speaker 1: It's very efficient right whereas Eclipse if you actually you know how like they talk about if you took an NFL game and cut out all the commercials the game is only like 20 minutes of real time or something like that of Actual playing from like start of plays to end of plays.

470
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,762
Speaker 1: this game is like no It's actually four hours long.

471
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:01,850
Speaker 1: and use the whole four hours.

472
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:08,322
Speaker 1: Eclipse is like five hours long but you actually you're only using like one hour of your own time and four hours of waiting.

473
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:18,990
Speaker 0: but it is also interesting how such a Sort of diversion and simulatory experience is crafted from a relatively small set of relatively elegant mechanics.

474
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:19,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, there's not.

475
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:22,930
Speaker 1: actually it's like it looks complicated It feels complicated.

476
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:34,762
Speaker 1: but if you were to say Redraw this game or read graphically design it to remove all the history stuff and the reality stuff and I would not be interested Mate, well, yeah, but make the symbology, you know more.

477
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:36,930
Speaker 0: Oh, I see where you're going on this, right?

478
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:40,629
Speaker 1: You would see the game actually isn't really as complicated as it appears.

479
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:41,672
Speaker 1: Yeah it is.

480
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,177
Speaker 1: it is actually not.

481
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:51,050
Speaker 1: it's like oh you have a round where you do stock stuff and Then you do have two rounds of not of playing the game and then you do stock stuff again.

482
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:53,699
Speaker 0: But what's also interesting is stock market play.

483
00:33:53,759 --> 00:34:05,297
Speaker 0: play stock market games you go around and around like this that are reasonably Simulatory like that kind of game style the fact that it has so much history steeped into it like the proper nouns and all Those like other train companies.

484
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:10,907
Speaker 0: it actually helps you build Pretty reasonably good directional heuristics.

485
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:26,530
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah based on just associating the fiction of the game with the mechanics like the combinations of some of those like independent railroads and Certain things you might want to do in a region is very intuitive like it would be in the real world.

486
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:40,243
Speaker 0: So the only real problem I have with this game before we get into like explaining how it actually works Is that so there's a concept in that book characteristics of games on Called busy work like games that have busy work like this

487
00:34:40,263 --> 00:34:41,850
Speaker 1: does have one busy work in it.

488
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:50,478
Speaker 0: But I'm gonna go one step further and there's I think I want to make a distinction I've been using this word a lot lately in game reviews between Pure busy work and what I like to call rituals.

489
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,505
Speaker 0: This game has a lot of rituals.

490
00:34:52,567 --> 00:35:06,896
Speaker 0: rituals are fine meaning but meaning that they are things that are moderately complex to do need to be done for the game to continue But they can be basically Entirely removed from your like.

491
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:11,710
Speaker 0: you don't need to know them to play as long as at least one person playing knows them.

492
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:12,473
Speaker 1: I think it was.

493
00:35:12,594 --> 00:35:16,732
Speaker 1: I think it's basically there's a bunch of stuff that a computer could do and then the game would take a Little hands.

494
00:35:17,054 --> 00:35:24,509
Speaker 0: Chris had that spreadsheet that we use for the dividends and all that crap Mm-hmm, and if you don't have that spreadsheet it takes longer to figure that out.

495
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:30,678
Speaker 0: so there and there is a ritual of moving the stock stuff up and down and Figuring out the numbers on the dividend.

496
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:32,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, this one makes a triple jump.

497
00:35:32,085 --> 00:35:33,130
Speaker 1: That one makes a double jump.

498
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't need to know.

499
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:39,550
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess I would have helped me have better direction or his sticks if I did fully understand that.

500
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:41,584
Speaker 0: But I thought you don't need to fully understand.

501
00:35:41,604 --> 00:35:42,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't play.

502
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:43,133
Speaker 1: well I didn't need to.

503
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:43,354
Speaker 1: I was.

504
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:48,417
Speaker 1: I was able to play well enough without knowing the exact Excruciating details.

505
00:35:48,658 --> 00:35:53,650
Speaker 1: but because the board game someone has to know them But only one person needs to know them and sort of be the computer.

506
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,494
Speaker 0: So that's my difference.

507
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:57,810
Speaker 0: busy work is things that are generally equally spread among the players.

508
00:35:58,011 --> 00:36:03,330
Speaker 1: Imagine if you were playing civilization the video game on a tabletop, but the rules are not changed at all.

509
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,361
Speaker 1: You have to be like, okay this city produces this much food this turn.

510
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,990
Speaker 1: Okay, it has enough food for population to increase.

511
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:12,303
Speaker 1: Yeah Which means this much food gets eaten and this much surplus food is left over.

512
00:36:12,323 --> 00:36:17,745
Speaker 1: and it's like a thing that when you play the Video game the computer just does for you, but because you're playing a board game here.

513
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:19,030
Speaker 1: You have to do that yourself.

514
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:19,872
Speaker 1: Yeah You are.

515
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:27,738
Speaker 0: you can choose to zoom in and pay attention to the specific math if you want to but you don't need to for Just need to know generally.

516
00:36:27,758 --> 00:36:29,406
Speaker 1: I want my population to go up.

517
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:30,190
Speaker 1: I need more food.

518
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:41,624
Speaker 0: so in this game the ritual is that as long as only as long as one person can Facilitate all the details which Chris did for us then I probably couldn't play it.

519
00:36:41,885 --> 00:36:54,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, the game is way more fun and That's why I'd be very interested in a well-made computer version of this game because the only other thing that has significant Ritualistic well, this one actually is busy work as well as that's dude on their own.

520
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,613
Speaker 1: This is the busier.

521
00:36:55,653 --> 00:36:59,250
Speaker 0: guys are calculate the optimal set of routes to run your trains on right?

522
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,194
Speaker 1: So here's how this works.

523
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:01,822
Speaker 1: is your each train company.

524
00:37:01,842 --> 00:37:03,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's talk about how the game actually plays.

525
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:04,895
Speaker 1: You have a train company.

526
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:06,159
Speaker 0: Well, no, you don't.

527
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:08,707
Speaker 0: you found a train company.

528
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:09,168
Speaker 0: Yes.

529
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:11,889
Speaker 1: Sure Whatever and you might have more than one.

530
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:13,159
Speaker 1: There's the tree.

531
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,973
Speaker 0: one might steal it from you Whatever.

532
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:18,130
Speaker 1: the train companies have money and trains and stocks.

533
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:22,282
Speaker 1: You as an individual person also have monies and trains and stocks.

534
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:29,910
Speaker 1: right and whoever has enough stock in a company Controls that company, but obviously someone could buy all the stock and take the company.

535
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's companies that don't exist yet in the game.

536
00:37:32,244 --> 00:37:37,565
Speaker 1: ever at the beginning of the game Everyone buys one company or founds one, but there's some unfounded ones.

537
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:38,549
Speaker 1: You can always pick those up.

538
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:38,970
Speaker 1: mid game.

539
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,395
Speaker 0: You might found a second one.

540
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:41,679
Speaker 0: You can have two different drink company.

541
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:55,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, but anyway, there's the independent drink When it's your turn when you operate you operate the companies that you control because you have enough stock in them that you're the president and You you you are the boss of that company.

542
00:37:55,029 --> 00:37:56,193
Speaker 0: now This is where it gets fascinating.

543
00:37:56,234 --> 00:38:00,810
Speaker 0: The goal of the game is for you the player to have the most money at the end.

544
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:06,265
Speaker 0: Yep, but your money is entirely distinct from the company's money.

545
00:38:06,425 --> 00:38:06,605
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

546
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:08,270
Speaker 0: That is the interesting thing.

547
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:13,070
Speaker 0: So when you operate a train company you spend the train company's money.

548
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:21,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't use your personal money to buy a train for the train company But you can order stock in a train company And that money goes to the train company.

549
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:24,350
Speaker 1: if the company still owns some of its own stock.

550
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:33,870
Speaker 1: You could buy stock from the company does to move your money in and the stock out and then when the train company Gets revenues those monies go to the shareholders.

551
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:41,916
Speaker 1: So if you own shares in a company or your opponent's companies when that train company operates and brings in revenue You would get some of that money.

552
00:38:41,997 --> 00:38:45,610
Speaker 1: but the train company still owns some of its own shares.

553
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,480
Speaker 1: That's how it gets more money.

554
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:56,990
Speaker 1: if a train company lose all of its shares It can't really make any more money and it has to continue to operate without any revenues because shareholders are taking all the revenue.

555
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:04,696
Speaker 0: Yep Now the other interesting thing is that the train companies they can invest in their own infrastructure Which basically just means buying trains.

556
00:39:04,997 --> 00:39:08,990
Speaker 0: Yep, and they can invest in shared track infrastructure.

557
00:39:09,211 --> 00:39:10,720
Speaker 0: Literally anyone can use.

558
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,831
Speaker 1: this is the most interesting part of the game Right?

559
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:18,150
Speaker 1: is that in most train games like in rare or tycoon you're moving cubes around and stuff like that, right?

560
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,490
Speaker 1: That's not what's going on here.

561
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:23,370
Speaker 1: Right what happens here is on a train company's tournament operates.

562
00:39:23,751 --> 00:39:28,609
Speaker 1: It can basically like do only a little bit very limited how much track they can lay out.

563
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,341
Speaker 1: They could like what do one upgrade in one piece of track?

564
00:39:31,462 --> 00:39:33,270
Speaker 1: Yep, pretty much or two pieces of track.

565
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,739
Speaker 1: I think it's not two upgrades.

566
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:36,390
Speaker 0: No, I messed that up like twice.

567
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:41,163
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you can only lay out a little bit of track and what you want.

568
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:43,810
Speaker 1: and the thing is the tracks belong to everybody.

569
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:50,410
Speaker 1: There's no owner of track It's just you're upgrading the tracks around the country or the city where the train station is.

570
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:54,003
Speaker 0: If you upgrade Centralia and have a better train station, that's great for everybody.

571
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:56,010
Speaker 1: and now the train company has stations.

572
00:39:56,851 --> 00:40:02,389
Speaker 1: And if all the stations in a city are blocked up, well, then someone else can't run their trains past it.

573
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:13,310
Speaker 1: But as long as they basically your trains start from one of your stations and then they run Where as long as it's not blocked pretty much to wherever they're gonna make the most money.

574
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:19,390
Speaker 1: And so this is the busy work part is basically you say well this train company has these two trains.

575
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:21,661
Speaker 1: These two trains can drive this far.

576
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:23,249
Speaker 1: Here's where my stations are.

577
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:27,664
Speaker 1: What are the routes that will make the most money for these two trains?

578
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:29,410
Speaker 0: and this is where a video game you could literally hit?

579
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,397
Speaker 0: And it would tell you the maximum run.

580
00:40:31,518 --> 00:40:34,750
Speaker 1: yeah, it's not like a decision it's just like what's the answer?

581
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,764
Speaker 1: You're trying to look at the board and figure out like how much money.

582
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:43,670
Speaker 1: it's like you audio The rule is you make the maximum, but it's like what is the maximum you had to some?

583
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:52,610
Speaker 0: It's like a little and you might choose to make less but and there are situations where that might make sense Yeah, sure, but yeah, you make the maximum.

584
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much you might fail to figure out the maximum because it's trying to hard to figure out.

585
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,522
Speaker 1: Well, I can use all the tracks on the board.

586
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,650
Speaker 1: What is the best route?

587
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,970
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it's these four stations and you most of the time you get it, right?

588
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,933
Speaker 1: But it's like annoying.

589
00:41:04,953 --> 00:41:09,430
Speaker 1: I if you played in a computer the computer could just be like your revenue is X done.

590
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:12,570
Speaker 1: It would take a fraction of a second part of my brain.

591
00:41:13,193 --> 00:41:16,389
Speaker 0: It's kind of fun until the map gets really complex toward the end.

592
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:19,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the early game is very obvious because you've only got like two stations like.

593
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,577
Speaker 1: well Yeah, it's these two stations.

594
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:23,847
Speaker 1: I get 80 bucks, but later in the game.

595
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:26,449
Speaker 1: It's like oh, no I can get ten more dollars if I go this way.

596
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:33,293
Speaker 1: Alright, and the other thing is that your your trains cannot share Track.

597
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:42,419
Speaker 1: they can't like bump into each other like each track Route or each hex edge can only be used once for you for you But someone else can use those hex edges.

598
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:42,781
Speaker 1: just not.

599
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:44,430
Speaker 1: you can't use your own hex edge twice.

600
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,754
Speaker 1: We have more than one train.

601
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:50,548
Speaker 0: So yeah, and there's all these other mechanics like so you can buy.

602
00:41:50,568 --> 00:42:04,410
Speaker 0: at the beginning of the game There's this whole draft where you can buy Independent companies that do different things up to and including Entire small independent railroads that run like a real company and eventually get brought into the big railroad.

603
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:10,370
Speaker 0: But you the player buy them with your own money, but then maybe you sell them to one of your train companies.

604
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:12,335
Speaker 0: But the game ends.

605
00:42:12,576 --> 00:42:14,080
Speaker 0: there's a there's an amount of money.

606
00:42:14,582 --> 00:42:20,796
Speaker 0: when that amount of money is taken from the bank then You the game ends.

607
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:24,347
Speaker 1: imagine playing Monopoly and the bank has ten thousand dollars in.

608
00:42:24,407 --> 00:42:25,170
Speaker 1: I'm just making up a number.

609
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:27,158
Speaker 0: Yeah Once that number was like it's zero right.

610
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:31,155
Speaker 1: and once the ten thousand dollars in the bank is completely gone The bank has zero left.

611
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:35,356
Speaker 1: you keep giving people money for that round until everyone has the amount of money They're supposed to have.

612
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:37,090
Speaker 1: yep, and then whoever has the most wins.

613
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:49,890
Speaker 0: So when that happens then the the winner is whoever themselves not their companies Just themselves has the most money between their money and the actual value of the stock they own.

614
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,272
Speaker 1: That's it.

615
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:54,543
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this game has like the the interesting parts of the game.

616
00:42:54,623 --> 00:42:58,630
Speaker 1: right you know the the large macro strategy parts is.

617
00:42:58,892 --> 00:43:10,114
Speaker 1: The big one is the buying of trains Because the trains go out of style and they become obsolete and if the train company can't afford to buy new or better trains They're just done They're screwed right.

618
00:43:10,496 --> 00:43:22,349
Speaker 1: so you have to basically acquire get a big pile of money in the train company So that the train company can buy a larger better superior train like two or three times during the game.

619
00:43:23,132 --> 00:43:29,629
Speaker 1: What happens almost immediately then is the next one is a little hard and the final one is super hard And you can get into situations where?

620
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:35,510
Speaker 0: Older trains become like obsolete and run a little bit, and then they're just like literally work.

621
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:38,882
Speaker 1: Those trains get like one last run, and then they're out.

622
00:43:39,143 --> 00:43:48,131
Speaker 1: you better have the new train lined up And it's like you have to make your trains Companies profitable enough that they can keep upgrading the trains and get that final up And you have

623
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:52,390
Speaker 0: to manage how much of the stock you like you buy for someone should leave in the company.

624
00:43:52,682 --> 00:44:01,590
Speaker 1: Yeah If you leave too many shares in the company Then you're sort of losing out on money and also leaving those stocks available to like be bought up by other people.

625
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,970
Speaker 0: But you're letting the company profit from its own work instead of extracting that wealth early.

626
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:10,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you buy the shares - you know you got to buy.

627
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:13,129
Speaker 1: It's like you got to buy them, but you don't want to buy them too early on buying too late.

628
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,661
Speaker 1: But you know shares in other people's company.

629
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:16,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is crucial.

630
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,152
Speaker 1: so like yeah It's like.

631
00:44:18,192 --> 00:44:20,424
Speaker 1: well rims train company is better than mine.

632
00:44:20,464 --> 00:44:21,410
Speaker 1: doesn't mean I'm gonna lose.

633
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:25,307
Speaker 1: You know I could maybe buy all his shares out right now his train company doesn't.

634
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:28,968
Speaker 0: it's interesting How accurate to the time the corporate stuff is yeah?

635
00:44:29,912 --> 00:44:34,030
Speaker 0: You literally you're trying to extract as much wealth from the system as possible.

636
00:44:34,311 --> 00:44:36,320
Speaker 0: You don't give a fuck about the train company.

637
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:36,742
Speaker 1: It doesn't?

638
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:38,610
Speaker 1: your train company has to be the best one.

639
00:44:39,152 --> 00:44:39,474
Speaker 1: You know.

640
00:44:39,615 --> 00:44:48,338
Speaker 1: the strategy I saw Chris use a lot was have one train company Run it into the ground then have a second one that comes in later And that one runs to the end game.

641
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:53,739
Speaker 0: because when you find a train company you do an IPO And you can pick the value of your stock right.

642
00:44:53,759 --> 00:45:02,888
Speaker 1: so it's like he makes a bunch of early game money by running one train Company in the ground uses that on a second train company that now has a bunch of money in its coffers So it can buy the better train.

643
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:11,030
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the get in terms of play and the way it feels you're using more real-world fuzzy heuristics.

644
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:13,922
Speaker 1: Also when that second train company comes in doesn't really need to buy tracks.

645
00:45:13,942 --> 00:45:15,710
Speaker 1: There's already tracks everywhere exactly.

646
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:26,674
Speaker 0: but you sort of have to just play it and Explore these mechanics kind of bounce off of them like if you play this game with anyone who's played it before You'll have fun.

647
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:27,698
Speaker 0: You'll lose.

648
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:37,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's I think that's the one best thing I can say about this game Even though it is a competitive skill game and also has this historical element and a thematic element, right?

649
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,185
Speaker 1: You know it takes a while never been upset by losing or winning at this game.

650
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:43,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's an experience.

651
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,092
Speaker 1: It's just like.

652
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:51,077
Speaker 1: it's just like oh you get to have a bunch of fun times playing trains running trains buying and selling stocks And like it feels good.

653
00:45:51,097 --> 00:45:54,290
Speaker 1: It doesn't feel like some roll and move garbage like Monopoly.

654
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,275
Speaker 1: It's all decisions.

655
00:45:55,316 --> 00:45:56,180
Speaker 1: This is not like.

656
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:57,588
Speaker 1: what luck is there in this game?

657
00:45:57,729 --> 00:45:57,970
Speaker 1: Nothing.

658
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:02,121
Speaker 1: Is there any luck at all in this guy just the initial drafting?

659
00:46:02,141 --> 00:46:06,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think there's not a. there's not a deck There's not a dice roll.

660
00:46:06,254 --> 00:46:06,957
Speaker 1: There's not a nothing.

661
00:46:07,258 --> 00:46:10,130
Speaker 1: Yep, right and it just feels way good the whole time.

662
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:10,943
Speaker 1: So you don't really.

663
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:17,690
Speaker 1: you know You don't get too upset and even though I don't think I don't think I've ever won I've always had done well enough had like a bunch of monies.

664
00:46:17,831 --> 00:46:20,630
Speaker 1: It's not like I got blowed up and sat there getting crap.

665
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:23,190
Speaker 1: You know the shit kicked out of me, but I could play this a few more times.

666
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:30,010
Speaker 0: I'm curious about trying the because apparently as from what I gather this one is probably the most accessible.

667
00:46:30,452 --> 00:46:36,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't see a reason to play the other ones unless you're a super trained nerd or unless you've played this one a bunch Of times and you're kind of sick of it.

668
00:46:36,856 --> 00:46:40,263
Speaker 1: Yeah The one thing is that every time I play this I've played it three times.

669
00:46:40,303 --> 00:46:45,203
Speaker 0: now actually play one of the other ones might Give insight like if the rules are a little different about a thing.

670
00:46:45,364 --> 00:46:48,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, like strategies back I think you'd only do that if you're way into it.

671
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,358
Speaker 1: true if you're just a board gamer in general It's like you're gonna try one of them.

672
00:46:52,378 --> 00:46:58,550
Speaker 0: try this one if you want to try a game That's more like these stimulatory war game II like weird stuff.

673
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:05,294
Speaker 0: This is a pretty good one for a euro gamer to try as long as you have someone who is going to teach you into The rituals.

674
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:05,555
Speaker 0: yeah

675
00:47:05,977 --> 00:47:23,257
Speaker 1: anyway, so the one thing about this game I played it three times and even though I played it three times There's plenty of time to learn the rules of a game is that it's this much time between plays that I sort of forget The not the maid done the general rules But these small details right.

676
00:47:23,518 --> 00:47:25,606
Speaker 1: when exactly do these trains expire?

677
00:47:25,947 --> 00:47:26,770
Speaker 1: when exactly?

678
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,740
Speaker 1: Can you start doing this versus doing that and whatnot?

679
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:31,950
Speaker 1: and those details matter a lot?

680
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,825
Speaker 1: So what happens is I forget those details the next time I play and I'll make a mistake.

681
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:39,805
Speaker 1: for example the most recent time We played at pecs unplugged.

682
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:41,910
Speaker 1: I Definitely made a huge mistake.

683
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:48,390
Speaker 1: I did something on a turn and there was no reason I couldn't have done that thing a turn earlier Which would have been just better.

684
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:58,190
Speaker 1: I just did a turn later than I could have for no reason just because I didn't realize I could at that time and That cost me some money whatever right?

685
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:04,730
Speaker 1: But it's like if I could play the game twice in a row or twice very close to each other.

686
00:48:05,271 --> 00:48:13,210
Speaker 1: I would basically remember all those tiny details that I've probably have already forgotten since pecs unplugged in the first game like the warm-up.

687
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:22,630
Speaker 1: Remember how to play remember all the details game Yeah And then play a second game with no excuses and no forgetting of those details and probably perform Really?

688
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:36,210
Speaker 1: Well, like I give myself an actual above zero percent chance of winning if I could play twice in a row in game two In game one no zero percent chance, but in game two, I think if I played twice in a row I would have a greater than zero percent chance of winning.

689
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,898
Speaker 0: So you wanna know the kind of person who plays this game?

690
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:41,636
Speaker 0: I'm looking at board game because had like the screenshot up The first comment.

691
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:44,677
Speaker 0: someone commented on this individual picture Mm-hmm.

692
00:48:45,111 --> 00:48:50,008
Speaker 0: And the comment is why is there a city tile on the hex immediately to the west of Detroit?

693
00:48:50,349 --> 00:48:53,525
Speaker 0: and sure enough There's one there because there's no city there in the game.

694
00:48:53,546 --> 00:48:53,968
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

695
00:48:54,651 --> 00:49:06,008
Speaker 0: And the next response is did they house rule Ann Arbor in and get a third person said basically There's a lot of people chatting about this error in this one random screenshot on board game.

696
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:06,810
Speaker 0: Can you mean photograph?

697
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:09,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a screenshot.

698
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:10,220
Speaker 0: it's not a screenshot.

699
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,343
Speaker 0: no board game it's not.

700

Speaker 1: okay, it's a photograph.

702
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:24,450

707
00:49:44,152 --> 00:49:50,239
Speaker 1: You keep hearing about like super nerdy train games super nerdy war games or things like that But you never actually go and play them ever.

708
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:52,290

715
00:50:02,985 --> 00:50:04,069
Speaker 1: you just don't have to do it again.

716
00:50:06,032 --> 00:50:13,246
Speaker 0: Yeah, and actually to be honest this game is Literally the ins the reason why I was inspired to make that new panel on the top 40 board the 40 board games.

717
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,967
Speaker 0: You should play well tabletop games cuz I'm a sneak some RPGs and card games in there.

718
00:50:19,108 --> 00:50:27,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz yeah Yeah, uh, we enjoyed this game and it's the kind of game that a lot of people who know us would assume We would not enjoy.

719
00:50:27,095 --> 00:50:35,150
Speaker 0: and shows what you know, I mean, I wouldn't buy it I wouldn't play no, I would not play it without someone who was able to do the ritual.

720
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:39,130
Speaker 1: I wouldn't I wouldn't play it super frequently, but it's the kind of thing I could play.

721
00:50:39,592 --> 00:50:46,903
Speaker 1: you know me a few more times before, you know, I've had enough of it and You know, I don't think I could keep enjoying it forever though.

722
00:50:47,225 --> 00:50:48,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's.

723
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:55,937
Speaker 0: eventually you've explored all the sort of mechanics and once you've explored them if you actually try to Hyper-optimize the game.

724
00:50:55,957 --> 00:50:58,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know it would still be fun.

725
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:59,013

726
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:00,639

Speaker 1: really?

728
00:51:01,322 --> 00:51:08,870
Speaker 1: in terms of even though it's cost a lot of time To play I can't get over the fact you get so much value like you're constantly doing stuff that whole time.

729
00:51:09,372 --> 00:51:12,206
Speaker 1: It's like every time I've played it like time is flown by.

730
00:51:12,226 --> 00:51:16,350
Speaker 1: it's like whoa It's already that time and it's like because you're just playing the whole time.
