1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,084
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, April 17th.

2
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:12,307
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:13,329
Speaker 1: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:15,032
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:19,160
Speaker 0: Tonight, the Olympics, Tibet, and China.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,700
Speaker 1: Dun dun dun.

7
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:26,614
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,518
Speaker 1: So I'm pretty sure I've decided to just get a PC and put Windows on it to do video because...

9
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:38,838
Speaker 0: At least for now.

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,863
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least for now.

11
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:46,440
Speaker 1: Mostly because I realized you could buy a Windows license for Newegg, the System Builders edition, for very cheap.

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:54,140
Speaker 1: I mean, Windows Vista Ultimate is usually like $300 something, but Newegg, the System Builders edition, is like $150.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,554
Speaker 1: And the only limitation is that you can't then install it on a different motherboard.

14
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:00,380
Speaker 1: So as long as I don't change the motherboard, I'm alright.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,760
Speaker 1: So as long as I don't install it, then the motherboard explodes and I need to RMA it, I'll be okay.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,320
Speaker 0: So what are you going to do down the road when you want to upgrade?

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,400
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,080
Speaker 0: I don't know, if you want to use this computer at some point, move the motherboard?

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,288
Speaker 1: I'm sure by the time I want to change the motherboard.

20
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:22,140
Speaker 1: I mean, I've had this motherboard in my current computer for five years.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,666
Speaker 1: The computer before that, five years.

22
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:29,500
Speaker 1: So I think that this one will last five years, maybe even longer.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,200
Speaker 1: I mean, my current computer could keep going if I didn't need to do the video editing, right?

24
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:39,860
Speaker 0: Well, in the very least, I mean, I think this will get us through the first, I don't know, year or so of Geek Night's video.

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it should.

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,900
Speaker 0: Beyond that, we'll be fabulously famous and wealthy and we'll just buy Avid.

27
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,540
Speaker 1: Or something, but like, I've complained about this before and it's probably better for Monday, so I can keep it short.

28
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:55,373
Speaker 1: But, you know, building a computer, I realized two things.

29
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:57,080
Speaker 1: You know, I haven't built a computer in a long time.

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:07,100
Speaker 0: You know, I just sort of- And I knew everything about consumer level computer technology.

31
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:12,420
Speaker 0: I knew the difference between the different chips on the different video cards and it was like, oh, man.

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:20,680
Speaker 1: They're really, they're making it more difficult because there's a lot more, you know, mostly in the power supply department where I have complained about that before many times.

33
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,987
Speaker 1: But I realized, though, they've made it more difficult.

34
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:28,720
Speaker 1: But at the same time, it's actually a better idea to do it than ever.

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:37,420
Speaker 1: I mean, you can get a computer like with a quad core crazy fuck holy shit on Newegg and build it for like under a thousand dollars.

36
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,720
Speaker 0: Was that the technical?

37
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,201
Speaker 1: Right.

38
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:45,600
Speaker 1: The computer that costs about a thousand dollars on Newegg costs like twenty five hundred from Dell.

39
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,265
Speaker 1: I mean, it's really getting sick.

40
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,872
Speaker 1: I bought two five hundred gigabyte drives.

41
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:52,500
Speaker 1: That's a terabyte for two hundred dollars.

42
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,976
Speaker 1: I remember when we were talking about, oh, my God, a terabyte is only a thousand dollars.

43
00:02:56,016 --> 00:02:56,740
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll get one.

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,280
Speaker 0: I remember not too long ago thinking, oh, my God, five hundred megabyte hard drive.

45
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,630
Speaker 1: So it's it's really getting crazy.

46
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,120
Speaker 1: I'm pretty close to making a decision.

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,828
Speaker 1: But what's funny is the CPU that I picked out.

48
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,399
Speaker 1: is it in the morning in stock now out of stock.

49
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:18,019
Speaker 1: So as soon as it comes back in stock, I'll probably make a move.

50
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:23,280
Speaker 0: One thing that's actually really helping us is that because we got just like the cheapest camera that'll do the job for now.

51
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:29,860
Speaker 0: No HD, which means we don't need nearly as much power or space any time soon.

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

53
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,688
Speaker 1: I mean, we're going for a large audience here.

54
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:36,040
Speaker 1: We're not going for, you know, like HD super production stuff.

55
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,780
Speaker 0: You know, quantity, not quality.

56
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,141
Speaker 1: Right.

57
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:38,603
Speaker 1: So we're good.

58
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:41,220
Speaker 1: We're doing YouTube's, you know, stuff like that.

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,495
Speaker 1: So the video just has to be better than everyone else's video.

60
00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:46,539
Speaker 1: But it doesn't have to be HD.

61
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,947
Speaker 0: The thing is, we've recorded something.

62
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:54,466
Speaker 0: We did this whole test thing and we didn't edit it together yet, because there's nothing to edit with yet.

63
00:03:54,586 --> 00:04:03,319
Speaker 0: But all I can say is if we even just put up what we recorded now on YouTube, it kind of frightens me how good it looks compared to a lot of YouTube's.

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,867
Speaker 1: Yeah, though it's not.

65
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,054
Speaker 1: I wouldn't put it.

66
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:07,100
Speaker 1: I think it's definitely beta.

67
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:08,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

68
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:10,640
Speaker 0: Well, I don't even know if I want to bother saving it after we.

69
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,759
Speaker 1: Well, we should save it, but I don't think we should.

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,100
Speaker 0: I think the thing that's going to really help us out is that every YouTube, even if it's technically well done, very often has terrible audio.

71
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:23,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're going to have good audios on our video.

72
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:24,760
Speaker 1: Half a video is audio.

73
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,308
Speaker 0: They just use the microphone and the camera.

74
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:33,780
Speaker 0: And actually I was looking at lavaliers and all that sort of thing, because we need those for our panels and things at conventions anyway.

75
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,080
Speaker 0: We really need all the kind of walk around the room wireless live mic solution because the kinds of things we do.

76
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:42,079
Speaker 0: And it's time, I think, to purchase something like that.

77
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:43,881
Speaker 1: Maybe.

78
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:47,560
Speaker 1: Also in the news, the New York Comic-Con starts tomorrow.

79
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:50,087
Speaker 0: Actually, well, it kind of started today.

80
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:52,674
Speaker 0: We actually there's the ICV to conference.

81
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:54,840
Speaker 0: that seems to be before every read exhibitions thing.

82
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,187
Speaker 0: And we actually had passes.

83
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:01,720
Speaker 0: We just didn't go because I had to go to work and I didn't want to take two days off of work.

84
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,060
Speaker 0: I think I'll go to it for the next New York Comic-Con.

85
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,680
Speaker 0: But I we skipped it for the last New York Anime Festival and we skipped it for this Comic-Con.

86
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,488
Speaker 0: So I feel like I got to go at some point.

87
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:14,060
Speaker 1: You can go, but I'm going to tell.

88
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:16,248
Speaker 0: That's why you go.

89
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:17,074
Speaker 0: There's cocktails.

90
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:17,920
Speaker 1: That's fun.

91
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,339
Speaker 0: Also, I imagine most of the press who go to those things are not quite like us.

92
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:28,340
Speaker 0: And I could foresee us asking the questions that everyone else in the room goes, my word.

93
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,160
Speaker 0: What sort of man is that and what kind of publication does he work for?

94
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,829
Speaker 1: And they'll take our badges away and kick us out.

95
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:36,955
Speaker 0: Maybe not.

96
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:37,417
Speaker 0: Maybe not.

97
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:40,319
Speaker 1: Anyway, we'll be hanging out there.

98
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:45,060
Speaker 1: You might see us, you know, we're probably not going to spend too much time on the show floor.

99
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:57,600
Speaker 0: If you want to find us, either try to scam your way into the press room or look at the schedule and try to think, who would Rim and Scott care about to cover as press as opposed to actually pay attention to for fun?

100
00:05:58,361 --> 00:05:58,984
Speaker 0: Yeah.

101
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,720
Speaker 0: Go find the Ninja Consultants in the podcast area.

102
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,980
Speaker 1: We might be in the podcast area quite a bit, you know, even though we don't have a table there.

103
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:10,140
Speaker 1: We might be an artist's alley buying arts because the artist's alley is pretty big.

104
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,138
Speaker 0: You know, I feel like I should not have my press badge on if I'm buying art.

105
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:14,901
Speaker 1: I know.

106
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:19,400
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to like when I'm doing stuff that's not press, I'm going to sort of like hide the badge.

107
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:25,540
Speaker 1: Because like when you had the press badge out, you have to be, you know, non-biased, non-partisan.

108
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,807
Speaker 1: You have to be like totally just.

109
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:28,920
Speaker 0: there is no smiling if you are press.

110
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:29,944
Speaker 0: Thank you very much.

111
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:35,879
Speaker 0: Whoever it was who was sitting in our panel at the New York Anime Festival, just talking to themselves the whole time.

112
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,359
Speaker 0: Those press guys, I forget who those press guys were.

113
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,141
Speaker 1: I don't know.

114
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:43,880
Speaker 1: But you just sort of, when you're press, you have to be serious business doing journalism.

115
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:47,640
Speaker 1: When you're not press, then you can be like, oh my God, your stuff is amazing or you suck.

116
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,550
Speaker 1: You know, that's what Engadget always complains.

117
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,620
Speaker 1: because Engadget, you know, they take it seriously.

118
00:06:52,781 --> 00:07:00,760
Speaker 1: Like they act like they're serious journalists and they are serious journalists and they go to like, you know, see Steve Jobs and all these people are clapping and they're sitting there not clapping.

119
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,370
Speaker 1: And they're like, what the fuck, guys?

120
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,396
Speaker 1: Are you journalists or not?

121
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:03,900
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

122
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,519
Speaker 0: Well, the answer is clearly not.

123
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,462
Speaker 1: Yes, clearly.

124
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:16,720
Speaker 1: But so when we are acting as entertainers, you know, bringing digital content to the masses, we look to Penny Arcade for our inspiration of how we should act.

125
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:24,319
Speaker 1: And when we are acting as press, which we don't do too often, we will look to Engadget because they're the best, so why not do what they do?

126
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:24,861
Speaker 1: You know,

127
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:42,080
Speaker 0: it's complicated because we've nominally covered, like we've been press at pretty much every convention we've been to, but there's always kind of like we've got the press badge or we've got the press thing, but we also have like at the New York Anime Festival, we have the professional badge, which was the gold like Willy Wonka ticket.

128
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,380
Speaker 0: So it's like, it's weird.

129
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,754
Speaker 1: Except for trying to get in five minutes early and then...

130
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they seem to only let the most menial grunts in at that point early.

131
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,858
Speaker 1: I know, I don't get it.

132
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,419
Speaker 0: Of course, it was just that one guy too.

133
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was that one guy.

134
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:55,974
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

135
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,960
Speaker 0: But anyway, we've already gotten some news news news news news news.

136
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:05,477
Speaker 1: Last thing I want to say, for your best chance of seeing us, you should go to the Kinokuniya Bookstores in Bryant Park around 3 p.m.

137
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:05,980
Speaker 1: on Sunday.

138
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,340
Speaker 0: Yes, you probably want to get there early.

139
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:18,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you'll probably see us at the convention, you know, late on Friday, you know, some early on Saturday because late on Saturday I'm going over to Queens.

140
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,372
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then I'll be there late on Saturday.

141
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:21,399
Speaker 0: We're going to kind of hand off.

142
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:27,838
Speaker 1: And then Sunday you'll probably see us there a bit until, you know, around 2 p.m.

143
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,098
Speaker 1: and then we're going to go over to Kinokuniya's.

144
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,775
Speaker 0: We'll probably be at Kinokuniya well before 2 p.m.

145
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:33,380
Speaker 1: to set up.

146
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe.

147
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,440
Speaker 1: I don't know if we have to set up anything.

148
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:36,419
Speaker 0: We got to be there.

149
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:44,260
Speaker 0: This is the biggest kind of non-anime con outside in the real world thing we've done yet.

150
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:56,460
Speaker 0: I mean, we do gigantic panels and these big like main event style things, but they're always in the anime con for the anime fans or at the gaming con where no one goes to panels ever.

151
00:08:56,943 --> 00:08:57,257
Speaker 1: Anyway.

152
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,839
Speaker 0: So now we're in the real world.

153
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,359
Speaker 1: That's still your best chance of seeing us.

154
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,157
Speaker 1: That's where you should go.

155
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:01,741
Speaker 1: Yeah.

156
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:06,519
Speaker 0: Plus, I think it'd be funny if you guys don't bother the Ninja Consultants looking for us.

157
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:07,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd be hilarious.

158
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,940
Speaker 1: Everyone go to the Ninja Consultants table in the podcast alley.

159
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,798
Speaker 0: And just ask for us.

160
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,360
Speaker 1: Also do the same thing at the Comic Geek speak table.

161
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,797
Speaker 1: Just ask, "Hey, have you seen Raymond Scott of Geek

162
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:17,160
Speaker 1: Nights?".

163
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:18,157
Speaker 1: We're looking for them.

164
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,620
Speaker 1: Just bother all the podcasters asking where we are.

165
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,420
Speaker 0: In fact, bother everyone at the con.

166
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,649
Speaker 0: Like, "Hey, we're the Geek Nights guys.

167
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,820
Speaker 0: I heard the Geek Nights guys are here.

168
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,413
Speaker 0: Oh my God, have you seen the Geek Nights

169
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:29,716
Speaker 0: guys?".

170
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,120
Speaker 1: That would be awesome.

171
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,160
Speaker 0: That would be really funny.

172
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,823
Speaker 1: And you know what?

173
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,340
Speaker 1: We should get people to do that at every convention.

174
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,520
Speaker 1: Just go around asking people where we are.

175
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,140
Speaker 0: Are we going to get to the point where instead of buying ads, we pay street money like the candidates do in Pennsylvania?

176
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,130
Speaker 1: That's such a clever form.

177
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,000
Speaker 1: I wonder if any marketeer has ever thought of that.

178
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,359
Speaker 1: They've thought of some clever stuff.

179
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:57,520
Speaker 1: People who did internet stores, they have boxes with their company's name on it.

180
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,420
Speaker 1: And they'll just give them to a doorman and have them sit on the curb to make it look like people are buying their shit.

181
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,280
Speaker 1: And it's sort of like buying an ad on the street.

182
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,237
Speaker 1: They'll have people on the subway discuss their products loudly.

183
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,040
Speaker 1: They've tried that.

184
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:25,159
Speaker 0: There was a big one I remember, because I had a bar when this happened once, where they would hire people to sit there, like a very beautiful woman, and order kind of conspicuously very specific alcohols.

185
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:29,060
Speaker 0: And then talk about them and flirt with people and get them to buy.

186
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:30,819
Speaker 0: And it was the dumbest thing.

187
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:41,300
Speaker 0: And actually, I only knew because like a week or two after I was at this bar, I saw a thing on the internet about these people and it was the same freaking alcohol.

188
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:44,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, go around the New York Comic Con.

189
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,459
Speaker 0: Appointedly did not say what kind of alcohol it was.

190
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,600
Speaker 1: And even if you know where we are, ask people who are complete strangers and don't know us where we are.

191
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:54,660
Speaker 0: If nothing else, you'll be really annoying.

192
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:03,014
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, if you ask someone who doesn't know Geek Nights, just ask a random person at Artist Alley, "Hey, have you seen the Geek Nights guys

193
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:03,417
Speaker 1: anywhere?".

194
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:05,338
Speaker 1: They'd be like, "Who are you talking

195
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:05,460
Speaker 1: about?".

196
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,120
Speaker 1: But it sort of gives the impression that you think they should know.

197
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:12,440
Speaker 0: It gives the impression that we have listeners.

198
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,201
Speaker 1: Right.

199
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:16,235
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's like that way that person is like,

200
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:16,818
Speaker 1: "Huh.".

201
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,977
Speaker 1: They see that there's a person asking them where someone is.

202
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,020
Speaker 1: Thus, this complete stranger must expect this other complete stranger to know these people.

203
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,459
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like, you know, if you asked, "Do you know where Stan Lee

204
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:30,620
Speaker 1: is?".

205
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,960
Speaker 1: Well, even if they didn't, you know, he's such a famous person.

206
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,780
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like you're pretending that we're famous.

207
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:38,695
Speaker 1: Thus, it causes them to think, "Huh, those guys must be

208
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:39,077
Speaker 1: famous.".

209
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:46,451
Speaker 0: Bonus points if you go to con people and ask why the hell Geek Nights isn't doing panels, even though it's actually they kind of asked us to.

210
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:48,380
Speaker 0: We just didn't because we didn't expect to be going.

211
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:50,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's also like 200 bajillion panels.

212
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:51,802
Speaker 0: Yeah.

213
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:57,360
Speaker 0: Plus, I guess we actually had some panels that we could have done, but we kind of want to test those first.

214
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:59,640
Speaker 0: So you'll be seeing all our new panels at like, Connecticut.

215
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,620
Speaker 1: I just think the most humorous thing about this whole convention for us is that I basically wasn't going to go.

216
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:09,360
Speaker 1: I was going to go maybe just like last year for a few hours on Friday and then leave.

217
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,596
Speaker 0: And then Tokyo FM was like, "Hey, just a CMR

218
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:11,777
Speaker 0: thing.".

219
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,030
Speaker 1: Then suddenly, usually we plan conventions.

220
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,176
Speaker 1: Like, we're planning Otacon now.

221
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:15,860
Speaker 1: It's months away.

222
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:19,060
Speaker 0: No, we planned Otacon like four months ago.

223
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:23,400
Speaker 1: Right, but New York Comic Con like weeks before we get thrown into it.

224
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,119
Speaker 1: And it's like, I'm like, "Goddamn

225
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:25,180
Speaker 1: it.".

226
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, "Yeah, I'm not going to go.

227
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,338
Speaker 0: Hey, could you go for this one

228
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:27,540
Speaker 0: event?".

229
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:28,367
Speaker 0: "I feel like we should just...".

230
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:29,517
Speaker 0: "All right, I'll go for this one

231
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:29,839
Speaker 0: event.".

232
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:31,612
Speaker 0: "Hey, by the way, we really want you to be press.

233
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:32,096
Speaker 0: Here's your press

234
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:32,438
Speaker 0: badges.".

235
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:33,612
Speaker 0: "All right, I'll go

236
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:34,159
Speaker 0: Saturday.".

237
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:35,335
Speaker 0: "Hey, there's this awesome event

238
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:35,618
Speaker 0: Friday.".

239
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,878
Speaker 1: "Well, God damn

240
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:36,939
Speaker 1: it.".

241
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,839
Speaker 1: "I feel like we should just not try for conventions anymore because they'll just come to us

242
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:41,020
Speaker 1: now.".

243
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,049
Speaker 1: "Like, we'll just be thrown into

244
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,231
Speaker 1: them.".

245
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:45,435
Speaker 1: "All right, let's do

246
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:45,637
Speaker 1: news.".

247
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,893
Speaker 0: "Anyway, so what do you got in the

248
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:47,197
Speaker 0: news?".

249
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,719
Speaker 1: "Oh, well, here's actually, this is more of a Monday news, but I'm just full of tech

250
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:52,020
Speaker 1: today.".

251
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:56,077
Speaker 0: "I only pushed you into the news because I forgot what my news was and I had to reopen

252
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:56,619
Speaker 0: Firefox.".

253
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,931
Speaker 0: "But then I remembered that it's about

254
00:12:58,354 --> 00:12:58,980
Speaker 0: logicielle.".

255
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:02,497
Speaker 1: "Oh, okay, well anyway, Microsoft patented

256
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:02,900
Speaker 1: something.".

257
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,096
Speaker 1: "And his is the article, the only gadget article about the

258
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:06,418
Speaker 1: patent.".

259
00:13:06,921 --> 00:13:09,778
Speaker 1: "And this is an example of patents that don't

260
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:10,099
Speaker 1: suck.".

261
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,136
Speaker 1: "Like, this is a worthwhile patent and if this product comes to be, I can see myself buying

262
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:14,197
Speaker 1: it.".

263
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,133
Speaker 1: "What it is, is a computer mouse,

264
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:17,636
Speaker 1: right?".

265
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,299
Speaker 1: "But the mouse, like, wraps around your hand, like, across your palm and over the back of your

266
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:24,620
Speaker 1: hand.".

267
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:27,558
Speaker 1: "And there's a button on the side, like, under your thumb,

268
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:27,960
Speaker 1: right?".

269
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:30,396
Speaker 1: "So, like, if you made a fist, you'd be gripping

270
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:30,477
Speaker 1: it.".

271
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:33,357
Speaker 1: "And it'd be like having a joystick in your hand that's not attached to

272
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:33,719
Speaker 1: anything.".

273
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:36,337
Speaker 1: "But if you open your hand, you can type on the

274
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:36,760
Speaker 1: keyboard.".

275
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:41,137
Speaker 1: "So, when you turn your hand sideways, it sort of activates the

276
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:41,559
Speaker 1: mouse.".

277
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:45,659
Speaker 1: "And then you sort of move your hand around like a joystick and push the button to click on

278
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:45,860
Speaker 1: things.".

279
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,075
Speaker 1: "But then you turn your hand sideways again and you type it on the

280
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:49,517
Speaker 1: keyboard.".

281
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:52,656
Speaker 1: "So you don't have to move your hand back and forth to the mouse and the

282
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:53,099
Speaker 1: keyboard.".

283
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:56,559
Speaker 1: "You just sort of pick your hand up, click on things, and then put your hand down and

284
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:56,760
Speaker 1: type.".

285
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:01,557
Speaker 1: "And for someone who's, you know, for a normal person, this isn't really too

286
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:01,918
Speaker 1: useful.".

287
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,019
Speaker 1: "But for someone who sits at the computer for a long time, this is like, 'Oh my God, I hope this is

288
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:07,200
Speaker 1: real.'".

289
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:09,417
Speaker 1: "And I hope it works as well as it looks like it's gonna

290
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:09,619
Speaker 1: work.".

291
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:12,057
Speaker 1: "And I hope it's as comfortable as I could imagine it

292
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:12,299
Speaker 1: being.".

293
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:12,688
Speaker 1: "'Cause

294
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:12,999
Speaker 1: goddamn.".

295
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,699
Speaker 0: "It's tricky, 'cause this is one of those things where you'll use it and you'll either go,".

296
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,679
Speaker 0: "'Aw, man, it's perfect,' or it'll just be completely useless and suck in every

297
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:21,960
Speaker 0: way.".

298
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:22,309
Speaker 1: "Yeah.".

299
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,538
Speaker 0: "Like the mouse man back in the

300
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:24,700
Speaker 0: day?".

301
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,453
Speaker 1: "Yeah, I'm not having a high

302
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:25,820
Speaker 1: expectation.".

303
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,557
Speaker 0: "Or the, uh, Cyberman

304
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:27,860
Speaker 0: mouse?".

305

00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:51,489
Speaker 0: "Probably, we've done that a lot, we'll see something, we're like 'man this is too good, let's save it' and then we just forget

476
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:51,790
Speaker 0: completely.".

477
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,950
Speaker 1: "I wasn't going to save it, I was going to use it right away, but I--".

478
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:54,887
Speaker 0: "Something else must have come

479
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:54,989
Speaker 0: up.".

480
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,344
Speaker 1: "I don't know if we actually used it or

481
00:19:56,385 --> 00:19:56,587
Speaker 1: not.".

482
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:58,150
Speaker 0: "I don't think so, but anyway--".

483
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,803
Speaker 1: "I couldn't find it by

484
00:19:58,844 --> 00:19:59,170
Speaker 1: searching.".

485
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:10,746
Speaker 0: "This is a stop motion animation involving food, a food fight if you will, and I don't think I need to say what it entails because you'll figure it out pretty quick, but it covers about 40 years of

486
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:10,967
Speaker 0: history.".

487
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:19,209
Speaker 1: "Yeah, I mean depending on how much you know about history, you'll be able to figure out what's

488
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:19,430
Speaker 1: what.".

489
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:28,249
Speaker 1: "And actually, I think that basically what you could do is you could show this scene by scene to a person and say any person, because there's no language,

490
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:28,690
Speaker 1: right?".

491
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:31,805
Speaker 1: "And say what part of history was that, you know, what is that

492
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:32,408
Speaker 1: representing?".

493
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:39,269
Speaker 1: "And if they can't tell you, then you could judge how much someone knows of history by how many of them they get

494
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:39,490
Speaker 1: right.".

495
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:47,789
Speaker 0: "I mean, you could debate whether or not, like, what specifically the falafel represents, but in a general sense, it's pretty obvious what the falafel

496
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,290
Speaker 0: represents.".

497
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:49,463
Speaker 1: "I know what the falafels

498
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:49,969
Speaker 1: represent.".

499
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,570
Speaker 0: "Yeah, but like between the two different kinds of sushi, or--".

500
00:20:55,511 --> 00:21:00,446
Speaker 0: "Yeah, anyway, this is pretty funny and poignant and cool and well done.

501
00:21:01,068 --> 00:21:01,469
Speaker 0: My hat is

502
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:01,710
Speaker 0: off.".

503
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:03,124
Speaker 0: "It also looks like it was made in the

504
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:03,185
Speaker 0: 70s.".

505
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:08,387
Speaker 1: "So I don't want to let this become the whole episode, so we're not gonna let this

506
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:08,769
Speaker 1: happen.".

507
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,209
Speaker 1: "This is not the whole episode, although we could do a whole episode on

508
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:12,330
Speaker 1: this.".

509
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,166
Speaker 0: "I don't know what Scott's doing, so I'm ready to make it a whole episode.

510
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:15,447
Speaker 0: I'm gonna

511
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:15,769
Speaker 0: ravel.".

512
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,597
Speaker 1: "No, there's a lady, and there's a hubbub on the internet.

513
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:19,600
Speaker 1: I think it was a lady,

514
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:19,780
Speaker 1: anyway.".

515
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:27,655
Speaker 1: "So she was at Bloomingdale's, right?

516
00:21:27,735 --> 00:21:29,179
Speaker 1: The original Bloomingdale's,

517
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:29,780
Speaker 1: right?".

518
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:33,736
Speaker 1: "And she had her nine-year-old kid with her,

519
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:34,239
Speaker 1: right?".

520
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,200
Speaker 1: "And she lived somewhere, you know, like you had to take the subway and then a bus--".

521
00:21:38,503 --> 00:21:39,456
Speaker 0: "Oh, I know what this

522
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:39,759
Speaker 0: is.".

523
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,749
Speaker 1: "--to get to her house,

524
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:41,334
Speaker 1: right?".

525
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:45,719
Speaker 1: "So her kid was nine years old, and, you know, she's like, 'You know

526
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:45,900
Speaker 1: what?'.

527
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,046
Speaker 1: "And she gave him a metro card, right?

528
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:49,370
Speaker 1: And some money.

529
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,619
Speaker 1: And, you know, she knew where the address

530
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:52,720
Speaker 1: is.".

531
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,407
Speaker 1: "And she says, 'All right, I'm going.

532
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:57,051
Speaker 1: You find your own way

533
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:57,312
Speaker 1: home.'.

534
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,418
Speaker 1: And, of course, the kid got

535
00:21:59,458 --> 00:21:59,658
Speaker 1: home.".

536
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:05,538
Speaker 1: "And, of course, you know, half of the people in the world--I don't know if it's half, but there's one

537
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:06,100
Speaker 1: contingent.".

538
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,007
Speaker 1: "And the contingent's like, 'You're crazy!

539
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:11,139
Speaker 1: You should be in jail letting your kid, nine-year-old kid alone in the

540
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:11,360
Speaker 1: city.'".

541
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:11,603
Speaker 1: "Oh my

542
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:12,151
Speaker 1: God!".

543
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,716
Speaker 1: "And the other half of the people are like, 'Yeah!

544
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:16,058
Speaker 0: Woo!'".

545
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,198
Speaker 0: "The funny thing is, I actually see a lot of young kids just, like, taking the bus or taking the

546
00:22:21,218 --> 00:22:21,659
Speaker 0: subway.".

547
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,425
Speaker 0: "Well, yeah.

548
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:22,789
Speaker 1: I know.

549
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:22,991
Speaker 1: I

550
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:23,112
Speaker 1: know.".

551
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:31,680
Speaker 1: "But, you know, really, I'm obviously--all I'll say for now is I'm definitely on the side of letting the kids roam

552
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:31,780
Speaker 1: free.".

553
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,826
Speaker 1: "You know what I

554
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:33,597
Speaker 1: mean?".

555
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,340
Speaker 1: "Well, with that reason--".

556
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,584
Speaker 1: "I'm not going to start the argument.

557
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:39,717
Speaker 1: Basically, if you want to know why I'm on this side, watch The

558
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:40,379
Speaker 1: Sandlot.".

559
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:46,398
Speaker 0: "I think the base issue--again, we won't make this whole show, but to kind of put it into a very clear--".

560
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:54,018
Speaker 0: "The issue that always comes up with us is that kids want to have fun, because that's what kids

561
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:54,199
Speaker 0: do.".

562
00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:04,599
Speaker 0: "And it seems like in a lot of places, adults will systematically take away or downplay every possible safe or interesting or harmless thing that kids could

563
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:04,779
Speaker 0: do.".

564
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:08,158
Speaker 0: "And then they wonder why the kids start doing the harmful

565
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:08,440
Speaker 0: things.".

566
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,538
Speaker 0: "It's like, 'Alright, I'm a kid, and I want to go ride my bikes and hang out with my

567
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:12,880
Speaker 0: friends.'".

568
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:14,431
Speaker 0: "Oh, can't go outside by myself

569
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:15,176
Speaker 0: unsupervised.".

570
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:16,412
Speaker 0: "Alright, I want a

571
00:23:16,452 --> 00:23:16,919
Speaker 0: skateboard.".

572
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,975
Speaker 0: "Oh, it's dangerous, and there's laws against it in a lot of

573
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:19,337
Speaker 0: places.".

574
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:20,533
Speaker 0: "Fine, I'll go to the

575
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:20,919
Speaker 0: arcade.".

576
00:23:21,022 --> 00:23:21,332
Speaker 0: "No more

577
00:23:21,394 --> 00:23:21,560
Speaker 0: arcades.".

578
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:22,855
Speaker 0: "Go to the roller

579
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:23,019
Speaker 0: rink.".

580
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:24,776
Speaker 0: "Shut down, because we don't want kids going

581
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:24,998
Speaker 0: there.".

582
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:27,357
Speaker 0: "Alright, I'll play video

583
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:27,579
Speaker 0: games.".

584
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,512
Speaker 0: "Video games make you a

585
00:23:28,593 --> 00:23:28,958
Speaker 0: murderer.".

586
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,077
Speaker 1: "Stop sitting in the house all the time playing video

587
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:31,360
Speaker 1: games.".

588
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,868
Speaker 0: "But don't go

589
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:32,517
Speaker 0: outside.".

590
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:34,295
Speaker 1: "Yeah, don't go outside alone and

591
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:34,658
Speaker 1: roam.".

592
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:35,451
Speaker 0: "Don't smoke that

593
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:35,777
Speaker 0: weed.".

594
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:36,936
Speaker 0: "And you know what they end up

595
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:37,119
Speaker 0: on?".

596
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,569
Speaker 0: "They're huffing

597
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:37,855
Speaker 0: paint.".

598
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:39,858
Speaker 0: "Like Darth Vader in that anime we watched

599
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:40,080
Speaker 0: yesterday.".

600
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:41,399
Speaker 1: "Yep.".

601
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:42,228
Speaker 1: "Or drinking cough

602

Speaker 1: syrup.".

603
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,230
Speaker 0: "What was Wormy at

604
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:45,733
Speaker 0: RIT?".

605
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:48,313

606
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:48,737
Speaker 1: tussin.".

607
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:50,918
Speaker 0: "He made a parody

608
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:51,080
Speaker 0: video.".

609
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:52,434
Speaker 0: "I gotta see if it's

610
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:52,800
Speaker 0: online.".

611
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,315
Speaker 0: "If not, I feel like we should just remake

612
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:54,416
Speaker 0: it.".

613
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,396
Speaker 0: "You know, there used to be these anti-drug

614
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:56,820
Speaker 0: commercials.".

615
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,175

Speaker 0: anti-drug.'".

619

626

Speaker 1: thing.".

627
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,932
Speaker 1: "Well, two things

628
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:20,259
Speaker 1: actually.".

629
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:26,138

630
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:26,640
Speaker 1: selfish.".

631
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,039
Speaker 1: "They don't, you know, there's obviously with anything you let your kid do, there's a risk of

632
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:33,460
Speaker 1: danger.".

633
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:35,796
Speaker 1: "And perhaps some reward of fun or something

634
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:36,037
Speaker 1: else.".

635
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:37,653

636

Speaker 1: selfish.".

Speaker 1: kid.".

640
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:45,660
Speaker 1: small.".

641
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,578
Speaker 1: "They selfishly remove all risk from anything happening to their kid so that they never have to

642
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:52,899
Speaker 1: worry.".

643
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,678
Speaker 0: "But I mean, when I was a kid, I roamed pretty much completely

644
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:55,960
Speaker 0: free.".

645
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:57,315

Speaker 0: Detroit.".

647
00:24:57,821 --> 00:24:58,815
Speaker 1: "I roamed pretty freely, but

648
00:24:58,856 --> 00:24:59,058
Speaker 1: anyway.".

649
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,557
Speaker 0: "If you live in downtown Detroit, you shouldn't be roaming too

650
00:25:01,617 --> 00:25:01,779
Speaker 0: free.".

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,109

658
00:25:18,337 --> 00:25:18,518
Speaker 1: had!'.

00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,293

Speaker 0: "That's one frightening

662
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:23,140
Speaker 0: thing.".

Speaker 0: come?".

667
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:28,156
Speaker 0: "Alright, I was in high school a long time

668
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:28,378
Speaker 0: ago.".

669
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:29,955
Speaker 0: "God, like a decade

670
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:30,239
Speaker 0: ago.".

671
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,565
Speaker 0: "And you know

672
00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:30,728
Speaker 0: what?".

673
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,080
Speaker 0: "When I got out of high school-".

674
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,538
Speaker 1: "Stop, you're turning the whole episode into

675
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:33,660
Speaker 1: this.".

676
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,151
Speaker 0: "I gotta say

677
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:34,335
Speaker 0: this.".

678
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:40,537
Speaker 0: "I remember thinking back, and now when I go, 'Wow, all the freedoms I had in high school are gone, and high school

679
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:41,098
Speaker 0: sucks.'".

680
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:50,419
Speaker 0: "But then, I remember when I was in high school, my parents said to me," "'Wow, all the freedoms we had when we were in high school are gone, it must suck for you to be in high

691
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:01,099

705
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:18,179
Speaker 0: Olympics?".

Speaker 0: "Oh,

707
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:18,776
Speaker 0: right.".

709
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:19,475
Speaker 0: chance?".

711
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,540
Speaker 1: alright.".

Speaker 0: "Alright, so-".

716
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,455
Speaker 1: "We're gonna talk about the current events

717
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:28,880
Speaker 1: Olympics.".

718
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,739
Speaker 0: "So a long time ago, the Kingdom of Tibet-".

719
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:33,689
Speaker 1: "Well, no, a long time ago,

720

Speaker 1: Athens.".

Speaker 1: "Athens, Greek, discuses, tracks and fields,

722
00:26:39,937 --> 00:26:40,459
Speaker 1: awesomeness.".

723
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:44,577
Speaker 0: "Alright, Scott, I'm curious, what is the continuity, uh, I'm curious how much you know about the

724
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:44,939
Speaker 0: Olympics?".

725
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,958
Speaker 0: "Between the ancient Greek Olympics, and the modern Olympics, 'cause there's no direct

726

Speaker 0: continuity.".

727
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,109
Speaker 1: "No, there isn't,

728
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:51,738
Speaker 1: basically.".

729
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,529
Speaker 0: "So when did the modern Olympics movement

730
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:53,811
Speaker 0: start?".

731
00:26:55,741 --> 00:27:01,678
Speaker 0: "Ish, I don't need a year, I want like, a half, like a double decade, I'd be fine with, maybe even a

732
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:02,219
Speaker 0: century.".

733
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:03,795
Speaker 1: "Oh, it's definitely the 20th

734
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:04,219
Speaker 1: century.".

735
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:04,653
Speaker 1: "Okay.".

736
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:08,194
Speaker 1: "Um, it was probably in the 30s, maybe the

737
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:08,255
Speaker 1: 40s.".

738
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,596
Speaker 0: "France had a lot to do with

739
00:27:10,657 --> 00:27:10,698
Speaker 0: it.".

740
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:11,527
Speaker 1: "Yeah.".

741
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,777
Speaker 0: "It was definitely before World War

742
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:13,857
Speaker 0: II.".

743
00:27:14,261 --> 00:27:16,798
Speaker 1: "I know, it was before World War II, that's why I was saying 30s and

744
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:16,838
Speaker 1: 40s.".

745
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:28,038
Speaker 0: "Because I gotta say, my favorite thing, is the, so many people, when all this hubbub began, were saying things, and I saw-" "There's a picture on FARC, of a guy holding up a sign, that says, 'Would we have gone to the Olympics with

746
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:28,400
Speaker 0: Hitler?'".

747
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:29,819
Speaker 0: "And it's like, uh-".

748
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,835
Speaker 1: "No, we didn't go to the Olympics with Hitler, in

749
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:32,177
Speaker 1: fact.".

750
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:33,632
Speaker 0: "Well, we did, and we

751
00:27:33,672 --> 00:27:33,955
Speaker 0: won.".

752
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,635
Speaker 1: "Oh, no, I, oh, sorry, did Hitler not go to the Olympics with

753
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:36,817
Speaker 1: us?".

754
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:40,776
Speaker 0: "We went to the Olympics, Nazi Germany, and we

755
00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:41,117
Speaker 0: won.".

756
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,077
Speaker 0: "Well, it's actually more complicated than that, but, anyway,

757
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:45,459
Speaker 0: continue.".

758
00:27:45,741 --> 00:27:47,118
Speaker 1: "Oh, I was right, the Russians, we didn't go at

759
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:47,300
Speaker 1: all.".

760
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:47,639
Speaker 1: "Yes.".

761
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,397
Speaker 1: "And they didn't go with us either, four years

762
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:49,700
Speaker 1: later.".

763
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,416
Speaker 0: "Yes, the Soviets was the problem, not so much the, uh,

764
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:53,100
Speaker 0: Nazis.".

765
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,319
Speaker 1: "But anyway, I'm not gonna teach you the history of the Olympics, because, uh, as we have just demonstrated, I am not a scholar on

766
00:27:59,359 --> 00:27:59,460
Speaker 1: that.".

767
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,020
Speaker 1: "I am more of a-".

768
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:05,058
Speaker 0: "Not that I am either, I was just in the position of being the accuser, thus being immune to all, uh,

769
00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:05,559
Speaker 0: inquiry.".

770
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:07,296
Speaker 1: "Yeah, what year did it start,

771
00:28:07,316 --> 00:28:07,559
Speaker 1: Rem?".

772
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:08,029
Speaker 0: "Odd

773
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:08,521
Speaker 0: 8.".

774
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,452
Speaker 1: "Yeah, uh, was

775
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:09,553
Speaker 1: it?".

776
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:12,253
Speaker 0: "Anyway,

777
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:12,500
Speaker 0: continue.".

778
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,114
Speaker 1: "Did you just look that

779
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:13,237
Speaker 1: up?".

780
00:28:13,543 --> 00:28:13,686
Speaker 0: "Just

781
00:28:13,748 --> 00:28:14,217
Speaker 0: continue.".

782
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:20,879
Speaker 1: "Anyway, I knew it was the early 20th century, but anyway, the Olympics, on paper, I feel, are really

783
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:21,320
Speaker 1: awesome.".

784
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:30,498
Speaker 1: "In that, you basically have a competition, uh, of, it's a friendly competition though, not a horrible war, it's a competition of

785
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:30,979
Speaker 1: greatness.".

786
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:44,179
Speaker 1: "And it's basically, you know, humans showing what humans have achieved, you know, in terms of the human body, in the whole world getting together, and sort of being like, yeah, people are awesome, all at

787
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,500
Speaker 1: once.".

788
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:46,744
Speaker 1: "And that's what the Olympics is on paper.

789
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:53,959
Speaker 1: And, on paper, I like the Olympics a lot, even though, from event to event, I find some events more qualified than

790
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:54,240
Speaker 1: others.".

791
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,098
Speaker 1: "For example, um, a really good Olympic event, the

792
00:28:58,138 --> 00:28:58,580
Speaker 1: javelin.".

793
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:01,032
Speaker 1: "A really bad Olympic event,

794
00:29:01,676 --> 00:29:02,138
Speaker 1: curling.".

795
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:03,396
Speaker 0: "What's wrong with

796
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:03,680
Speaker 0: curling?".

797
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:04,568
Speaker 1: "Shush.".

798
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:11,158
Speaker 0: "What you always, you always bring up, we'll have a nice conversation, we'll have a nice dinner, and then out of the blue, you'll disparage

799
00:29:11,198 --> 00:29:11,620
Speaker 0: curling.".

800
00:29:11,842 --> 00:29:12,048
Speaker 1: "That's

801
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:12,336
Speaker 1: right.".

802
00:29:12,582 --> 00:29:13,010
Speaker 0: "Curling's

803
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:13,519
Speaker 0: fine.".

804
00:29:13,662 --> 00:29:14,436
Speaker 1: "Curling is my...".

805
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:26,378
Speaker 0: "The only problem with curling, curling, curling, is the fact that I remember a few years ago, there seemed to be this kind of concentrated media effort to make curling

806
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:26,919
Speaker 0: popular.".

807
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:30,687
Speaker 0: "And I saw this, like they were trying to get people to care about curling.

808
00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:36,279
Speaker 0: It obviously failed, and I haven't seen them try it since, but ever since then, Scott has just bitched and moaned about

809
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:36,760
Speaker 0: curling.".

810
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:37,469
Speaker 1: "I never liked

811

Speaker 1: curling.".

812
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,412
Speaker 0: "Maybe it's because, I don't know, in Michigan, we'd curl sometimes.

813
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:43,039
Speaker 0: It's not that bad of a

814
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:43,280
Speaker 0: sport.".

Speaker 1: That's all I'm gonna

817
00:29:46,838 --> 00:29:46,999
Speaker 1: say.".

Speaker 1: big.".

Speaker 1: "Bigger than I can pick

846

Speaker 1: up.".

Speaker 0: "So, the Olympics...".

848
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,776
Speaker 1: "I just sorta had to shuffle it out

849
00:30:11,796 --> 00:30:11,979
Speaker 1: there.".

850
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,726

854
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:16,797
Speaker 1: Wow.".

855
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,412
Speaker 1: "Damn, I was off by six

856
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:18,674
Speaker 1: years.".

857
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:20,757
Speaker 1: "So, on paper, I like the

858
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,000
Speaker 1: Olympics.".

859
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:22,849
Speaker 0: "Six years?

860
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:23,678
Speaker 0: Anyway, go

861
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:23,799
Speaker 0: on.".

862
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,415
Speaker 0: "You were like, yeah, the '20s, the

863
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:25,475
Speaker 0: '30s?".

864
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:27,497
Speaker 1: "No, but I mean, I guess the century,

865
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:27,760
Speaker 1: right?".

866
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,537
Speaker 1: "Anyway, on paper, they're awesome,

867
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:30,980
Speaker 1: right?".

868
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,878
Speaker 1: "In reality, in recent years at least, they're not as

869
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:35,300
Speaker 1: awesome.".

870
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:41,339
Speaker 1: "Because, basically, in addition to the on-paper parts of the Olympics,".

871
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,359
Speaker 1: "they have sort of added this, you know, just like every other sport in the world,".

872
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:50,918
Speaker 1: "the consumerism, the marketing, the sponsorship, the money, the corporatism...".

873
00:30:51,520 --> 00:31:01,420
Speaker 0: "The level of just violent aggression that the International Olympic Committee" "has taken toward the trademarks, the copyrights, the broadcast rights,".

874
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:04,538
Speaker 0: "of something that nominally should be available to all the people of the

875
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:04,840
Speaker 0: world.".

876
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,600
Speaker 1: "Yeah, if anything, right, if you look at the spirit of the Olympics,".

877
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,859
Speaker 1: "you have to say, 'This is something that everyone in the world should be able to take part in at no

878
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,040
Speaker 1: cost.'".

879
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,337
Speaker 1: "Just, you know, sort of a coming together of all the peoples and saying, 'People are

880
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:20,798
Speaker 1: awesome.'".

881
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,832
Speaker 1: "Hooray.".

882
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:24,178
Speaker 0: "But, instead, the Olympics are this...".

883
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,899
Speaker 0: "I mean, I remember stories of, like, Olympic diners, you know, 'cause Greece and such,".

884
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,020
Speaker 0: "run by Greek people, being shut down by the Olympics as they move into a given city,".

885
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,037
Speaker 0: "because they're so crazy about their copyrights and their trademarks and their

886
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:38,760
Speaker 0: whatchamacallits.".

887
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,436
Speaker 1: "Yeah, it's really not

888
00:31:40,476 --> 00:31:40,679
Speaker 1: cool.".

889
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,970
Speaker 0: "Also the fact that, I'll admit I have a selfish reason, in the

890
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,431
Speaker 0: U.S.,

891
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:46,819
Speaker 0: we get completely gypped on the

892
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:47,140
Speaker 0: Olympics.".

893
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,278
Speaker 0: "We don't get to see any Olympic sport that I care about at

894
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:50,580
Speaker 0: all.".

895
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,417
Speaker 1: "If you have a satellite dish, I'm pretty sure you can watch all the cool

896
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:54,779
Speaker 1: events.".

897
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:55,952
Speaker 0: "Yes, if I have a satellite

898
00:31:55,972 --> 00:31:56,155
Speaker 0: dish.".

899
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,235
Speaker 1: "But if you don't have a dish, you're pretty much on network TV,".

900
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,019
Speaker 1: "unless you watch, like, during the day, you can see some cool events, maybe,".

901
00:32:03,744 --> 00:32:05,797
Speaker 1: "but mostly you're just gonna see the U.S.

902
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:06,320
Speaker 1: people participating,".

903
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,375
Speaker 1: "especially the ones who are probably gonna

904
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:08,578
Speaker 1: win.".

905
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,058
Speaker 0: "And even then, only in the sports that they think Americans care

906
00:32:12,078 --> 00:32:12,400
Speaker 0: about.".

907
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,274
Speaker 1: "Yeah, or the sports that they think they can market and make

908
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:15,777
Speaker 1: popular.".

909
00:32:16,764 --> 00:32:17,716
Speaker 1: "Or in the championship

910
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:17,999
Speaker 1: rounds.".

911
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,520
Speaker 1: "You're never gonna see, like, you know, the low-end rounds,".

912
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:21,777
Speaker 1: "like, you know, the first heats,".

913
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,218
Speaker 1: "or, like, you know, the qualifiers or anything like

914
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:24,420
Speaker 1: that.".

915
00:32:24,481 --> 00:32:25,700
Speaker 1: "You're only gonna see, like, the big ones,".

916
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,673
Speaker 1: "like, whoever wins this gets a gold medal, oh my

917
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:27,996
Speaker 1: God.".

918
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,240
Speaker 1: "Anyway, the second thing about the Olympics is that,".

919
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:34,420
Speaker 1: "if you really think about it, and think about it hard,".

920
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,200
Speaker 1: "the Olympics is the only,".

921
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:40,919
Speaker 1: "even though it's not, you know, following its spirit,".

922
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:43,134
Speaker 1: "it's the only world stage,

923
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:43,779
Speaker 1: really.".

924
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,878
Speaker 1: "I mean, what other, if you wanted to somehow get a message out,".

925
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:50,460
Speaker 1: "to the whole civilized world,".

926
00:32:50,641 --> 00:32:52,536
Speaker 1: "every continent, every country,

927
00:32:52,858 --> 00:32:53,080
Speaker 1: right?".

928
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:53,772
Speaker 1: "Pretty much every

929
00:32:53,812 --> 00:32:54,138
Speaker 1: country.".

930
00:32:55,825 --> 00:32:57,596
Speaker 1: "Even if you make a speech at the U.N.

931
00:32:57,616 --> 00:32:58,139
Speaker 1: or something,".

932
00:32:58,441 --> 00:33:00,678
Speaker 1: "it's not gonna get out there unless it's so...".

933
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:03,960
Speaker 0: "Even if, I don't think anyone out there could even name".

934

Speaker 0: "anyone who works for the

935
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:06,119
Speaker 0: U.N.".

936
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,401
Speaker 0: "Right.

937
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:11,119
Speaker 1: I mean, it's really, really hard" "to get a message out to the whole world,".

938
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:15,080
Speaker 1: "but the Olympics, you know, being as they are a sport,".

939
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,007
Speaker 1: "they are circuses.

940
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:17,640
Speaker 1: I mean, people pay attention to circuses".

941
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,056
Speaker 1: "a lot more than they do to, you know, politics and things and

942
00:33:20,076 --> 00:33:20,258
Speaker 1: war.".

943
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,737
Speaker 1: "So, if you can...".

944
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:22,387
Speaker 0: "And

945
00:33:22,427 --> 00:33:22,692
Speaker 0: bread.".

946
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:23,563
Speaker 1: "Right.

947
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:28,960
Speaker 1: So, if you can get your message" "attached to the world circus,".

948
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,757
Speaker 1: "which is pretty much what the Olympics is,".

949
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:32,158
Speaker 1: "the only world circus,".

950
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:35,160
Speaker 1: "that is a way to get your message out to the whole world,".

951
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,737
Speaker 1: "that is more effective than perhaps

952
00:33:36,758 --> 00:33:36,960
Speaker 1: anything.".

953
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:45,156
Speaker 1: "And thus, throughout the history of the Olympics," "many protests and many world issues" "have attached themselves to the

954
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:45,580
Speaker 1: Olympics.".

955
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,218
Speaker 1: "And I don't think that, you know, think about, you know,".

956
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:50,398
Speaker 1: "the Black Panthers, you know,".

957
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:52,840
Speaker 1: "Russia not going to us, us not going to Russia,".

958
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:56,380
Speaker 1: "you know, Nazi Germany, the killing of the Israelis,".

959
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:58,174
Speaker 1: "remember that, the little terrorism going

960
00:33:58,194 --> 00:33:58,255
Speaker 1: on?".

961
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:00,670
Speaker 0: "Very clear details.

962
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,978
Speaker 0: I wrote a paper on it in high

Speaker 0: school.".

964
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:02,548
Speaker 0: "Right.".

Speaker 1: "All these things have attached themselves to the Olympics,".

966
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,417
Speaker 1: "and while many of them are terrible and some of them are good,".

967
00:34:09,322 --> 00:34:13,800
Speaker 1: "I think that is also part of the spirit of the new Olympics,".

968
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,938
Speaker 1: "not so much, you know, the Athenian Olympics,".

969
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,300
Speaker 1: "but the new Olympics, I think that, you know,".

970
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,578
Speaker 1: "using it as a stage to get a message to the world" "is also, you know, part of what the Olympics

971
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:24,759
Speaker 1: is.".

972
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,077
Speaker 1: "Now, that brings us to today,".

973
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:29,975
Speaker 1: "where we have the shit going down in

974
00:34:29,995 --> 00:34:30,277
Speaker 1: Tibet.".

975
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:31,976
Speaker 1: "Basically...".

976
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:33,878
Speaker 0: "That was a very eloquent way of putting

977
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:34,040
Speaker 0: that.".

978
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:35,096
Speaker 1: "I think that's the only way to put

979
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:35,157
Speaker 1: it.".

980
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,563
Speaker 0: "Yeah.

981
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:36,496
Speaker 0: Now, the thing is,".

982
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,435
Speaker 0: "the Tibet issue is not, shall we say,

983
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:39,514
Speaker 0: new.".

984
00:34:40,503 --> 00:34:41,458
Speaker 1: "No, it is quite...".

985
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,514
Speaker 0: "This has been going on for some

986
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:42,880
Speaker 0: time.".

987
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,620
Speaker 1: "No, also the Chinese human rights issue in general,".

988
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:46,516
Speaker 1: "is not

989
00:34:46,578 --> 00:34:46,699
Speaker 1: new.".

990
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:48,512
Speaker 1: "In fact, it's as old as, um,

991
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:48,592
Speaker 1: Mao.".

992
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:50,112
Speaker 0: "Now, there...".

993
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:52,614
Speaker 0: "It's all about Chiang

994
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:53,000
Speaker 0: Kai-shek.".

995
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,893
Speaker 1: "But unlike Mao, it is not

996
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:55,114
Speaker 1: dead.".

997
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:56,866
Speaker 0: "Rofl

998
00:34:56,907 --> 00:34:57,132
Speaker 0: Mao?".

999
00:34:57,843 --> 00:34:58,146
Speaker 1: "Yes.

1000
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,275
Speaker 1: Only without the

1001
00:34:59,295 --> 00:34:59,679
Speaker 1: rofling.".

1002
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,437
Speaker 0: "I think we should preface all of this by,".

1003
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,914
Speaker 0: "I don't really want to talk about the history of

1004
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:04,277
Speaker 0: China.".

1005
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,374
Speaker 0: "I don't want to talk about the history of the

1006
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:06,798
Speaker 0: Olympics.".

1007
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:08,914
Speaker 0: "I don't want to talk about the history of

1008
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:09,277
Speaker 0: Tibet.".

1009
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,336
Speaker 0: "I don't want to talk about the...".

1010
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,340
Speaker 0: "Because there's also a really important conflated issue,".

1011
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,740
Speaker 0: "that on one hand, the human rights issues" "have always been kind of a nagging sore point".

1012
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,915
Speaker 0: "with a lot of people in the

1013
00:35:20,956 --> 00:35:21,159
Speaker 0: world.".

1014
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:23,215
Speaker 0: "At least in the

1015
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:23,598
Speaker 0: West.".

1016
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,296
Speaker 0: "Because, as we discovered," "there were violent protests everywhere the torch went,".

1017
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:30,520
Speaker 0: "until it got to South America,".

1018
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:31,556
Speaker 0: "and then no one gave a

1019
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:31,760
Speaker 0: shit.".

1020
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,852
Speaker 0: "And there was no protest at

1021
00:35:33,236 --> 00:35:33,317
Speaker 0: all.".

1022
00:35:33,702 --> 00:35:33,904
Speaker 1: "Yep.

1023
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:34,856
Speaker 1: I mean, I...".

1024
00:35:35,282 --> 00:35:35,971
Speaker 1: "I'm gonna say it right

1025
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:36,194
Speaker 1: now.".

1026
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:38,255
Speaker 1: "Human rights in China is

1027
00:35:38,557 --> 00:35:38,618
Speaker 1: ass.".

1028
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:39,935
Speaker 1: "China needs to clean that shit

1029
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:40,077
Speaker 1: up.".

1030
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,237
Speaker 0: "The thing is, I have all these other things to talk

1031
00:35:43,298 --> 00:35:43,438
Speaker 0: about.".

1032
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:45,879
Speaker 0: "Like, China and India are in a similar vote,".

1033
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,316
Speaker 0: "but yet they're handling everything completely

1034
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:47,660
Speaker 0: differently.".

1035
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:50,160
Speaker 0: "And yet also, there's a conflated issue,".

1036
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,360
Speaker 0: "of that a lot of people in America,".

1037
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:53,611
Speaker 0: "in Europe in particular,".

1038
00:35:54,741 --> 00:35:57,740
Speaker 0: "while, nominally, they're against the human rights violations,".

1039
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:01,240
Speaker 0: "and while, popularly, they're against the oppression of Tibet,".

1040
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,959
Speaker 0: "because the Tibet thing is a very popular issue to be behind,".

1041
00:36:05,282 --> 00:36:06,980
Speaker 0: "rather or not, I mean, I'm behind it too,".

1042
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,700
Speaker 0: "but a lot of people, I think, are behind it,".

1043
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,436
Speaker 0: "because it's a very easy thing to be

1044
00:36:11,476 --> 00:36:11,698
Speaker 0: for.".

1045
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:14,299
Speaker 1: "Well, I mean, it's sort of, it's one of those things,".

1046
00:36:14,621 --> 00:36:17,760
Speaker 1: "where it's so outrageously one person is wrong,".

1047
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,898
Speaker 1: "and one person is right, or so it seems,".

1048
00:36:20,663 --> 00:36:24,893
Speaker 1: "and the fact that the person who's right is not winning," "is just like, come

1049
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:25,318
Speaker 1: on!".

1050
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,220
Speaker 0: "But there's this conflating factor,".

1051
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:35,080
Speaker 0: "that a lot of people, in America in particular," "are very paranoid about China anyway, economically,".

1052
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,080
Speaker 0: "especially because the American economy,".

1053
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:40,398
Speaker 0: "if you haven't noticed, is in the pooper,".

1054
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:41,915
Speaker 0: "in years that Dave and Joel

1055
00:36:41,996 --> 00:36:42,259
Speaker 0: isn't.".

1056
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:42,992
Speaker 0: "Relatively

1057
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:43,400
Speaker 0: speaking."

1058
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,819
Speaker 0: "Well, it depends on where you live,".

1059
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,460
Speaker 0: "but the dollar is falling like a rock,".

1060
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:48,280
Speaker 0: "and China has actually been playing hardball,".

1061
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,680
Speaker 0: "in that their currency is undervalued,".

1062
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:52,600
Speaker 0: "compared to the dollar,".

1063
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:54,697
Speaker 0: "and there's all this shady stuff going on,".

1064
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:57,860
Speaker 0: "and I think a lot of people who say they're for Tibet,".

1065
00:36:58,244 --> 00:37:04,220
Speaker 0: "and against the human rights violations," "and are jumping on the Olympics bandwagon," "actually are just xenophobic".

1066
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,280
Speaker 0: "about China's emergence as an economic power,".

1067
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:07,979
Speaker 0: "and this is kind of--".

1068
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:09,500
Speaker 0: "I'm not saying the majority,".

1069
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:10,837
Speaker 0: "but I know there are people like

1070
00:37:10,857 --> 00:37:10,999
Speaker 0: this.".

1071
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:12,800
Speaker 1: "I'm sure there are some people like that,".

1072
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,020
Speaker 1: "but I think the majority of people--".

1073
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,580
Speaker 0: "Because the level of misinformation".

1074
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,560
Speaker 0: "I've seen from a lot of the pictures".

1075
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:19,498
Speaker 0: "of people with protest signs at the

1076
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:19,720
Speaker 0: torch.".

1077
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:21,800
Speaker 0: "Plus, but let's get--".

1078
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:23,197
Speaker 1: "I think what it is is that, you know,".

1079
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,660
Speaker 1: "Tibet has always been an issue".

1080
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,960
Speaker 1: "that people all knew about, right,".

1081
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,720
Speaker 1: "and they were all on the side of Tibet,".

1082
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,414
Speaker 1: "or at least, you know,".

1083
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,339
Speaker 1: "but there was never really an opportunity" "to do something about it,".

1084
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,740
Speaker 1: "until the Olympics happened to be scheduled in Beijing,".

1085
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,551
Speaker 1: "and now, you know,".

1086
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,140
Speaker 1: "if they would have acted way long ago,".

1087
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:41,339
Speaker 1: "like when the Olympics were first announced to be there,".

1088
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:43,119
Speaker 1: "then they could have just moved them,".

1089
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:44,299
Speaker 1: "but now it's sort of like,".

1090
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:45,554
Speaker 1: "haha, it's too late, let's

1091
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:45,817
Speaker 1: go!".

1092
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,540
Speaker 0: "They could have always moved them to Peking,".

1093
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,132
Speaker 0: "Nah, because at my work,".

1094
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,959
Speaker 0: "someone made fun of someone else,".

1095
00:37:54,302 --> 00:37:55,738
Speaker 0: "by making a joke like that,".

1096
00:37:56,003 --> 00:37:56,560
Speaker 0: "because the other person--".

1097
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,733
Speaker 1: "I can see how that can be a funny

1098
00:37:57,773 --> 00:37:57,996
Speaker 1: joke.".

1099
00:37:58,522 --> 00:37:59,537
Speaker 0: "The other person didn't know,".

1100
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:03,220
Speaker 0: "and the person making the joke" "made it with the look in the eyes,".

1101
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,200
Speaker 0: "that I've seen this look before,".

1102
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,019
Speaker 0: "of I know that no one gets this joke from me,".

1103
00:38:06,282 --> 00:38:07,560
Speaker 0: "and they have the chortle of self-satisfaction,".

1104
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:10,580
Speaker 0: "but I got it, so I look him in the eye,".

1105
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:11,598
Speaker 0: "and I chortle,".

1106
00:38:11,862 --> 00:38:13,357
Speaker 0: "and then we started laughing out loud,".

1107
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:15,599
Speaker 0: "and the third person's like,".

1108
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:16,042
Speaker 0: "What?

1109
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:17,975
Speaker 0: What the hell's wrong with

1110
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:18,116
Speaker 0: you?".

1111
00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:19,016
Speaker 0: "What?".

1112
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:20,239
Speaker 1: "I got the joke on a delay,".

1113
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:20,991
Speaker 1: "because I didn't see it

1114
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:21,317
Speaker 1: coming.".

1115
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,969
Speaker 1: "You snuck it in there a little

1116
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:23,311
Speaker 1: quickly.".

1117
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,460
Speaker 0: "Because I've been thinking about it all day,".

1118
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,789
Speaker 0: "it was really

1119
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:27,077
Speaker 0: funny.".

1120
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:27,891
Speaker 1: "It was a good joke,

1121
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:28,074
Speaker 1: yeah.".

1122
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:29,599
Speaker 0: "So I totally stole it,".

1123
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:30,599
Speaker 0: "I don't think I made that

1124
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:30,660
Speaker 0: up.".

1125
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,298
Speaker 1: "It's like the Olympics are in Beijing,".

1126
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:34,099
Speaker 1: "and there's all these protests,".

1127
00:38:34,322 --> 00:38:35,453
Speaker 1: "oh, why don't they just move them to

1128
00:38:35,473 --> 00:38:35,917
Speaker 1: Peking?".

1129
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:39,358
Speaker 0: "Yes, that scout was the

1130
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:39,580
Speaker 0: joke.".

1131
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:39,949
Speaker 1: "I know,

1132
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,113
Speaker 1: right?".

1133
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,558
Speaker 0: "But I also don't want to--".

1134
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:44,478
Speaker 0: "Well, I guess I kind of have to talk,".

1135
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:46,019
Speaker 0: "but the way I look at this,".

1136
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,774
Speaker 0: "there's a lot of ways to look at the Olympic protests,".

1137
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:53,319
Speaker 0: "I would be against the protests of the Olympics,".

1138
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:55,759
Speaker 0: "on the grounds that the Olympics are supposed to be,".

1139
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:59,260
Speaker 0: "in theory, this worldwide coming together,".

1140
00:38:59,382 --> 00:38:59,910
Speaker 0: "despite

1141
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:00,620
Speaker 0: everything.".

1142
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:02,840
Speaker 0: "Nothing should stop the Olympics,".

1143
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,319
Speaker 0: "except the Cold War,".

1144
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:05,399
Speaker 0: "because we were dumbasses,".

1145
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:05,825
Speaker 0: "but I

1146
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:06,392
Speaker 0: digress.".

1147
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:09,420
Speaker 0: "But at the same time, the Olympics are so corporate,".

1148
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:10,960
Speaker 0: "and so money-driven,".

1149
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,439
Speaker 0: "that I have almost no sympathy for the IOC,".

1150
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:14,680
Speaker 0: "or the Olympics at all,".

1151
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,058
Speaker 0: "and the only people I have any sympathy at all for,".

1152
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:17,848
Speaker 0: "are the

1153
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,416
Speaker 0: athletes.".

1154
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:21,196
Speaker 1: "Right, I think, really, I'm totally--".

1155
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:23,380
Speaker 1: "And not even the athletes in the West,".

1156
00:39:23,582 --> 00:39:25,260
Speaker 0: "only the athletes from those countries,".

1157
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:27,018
Speaker 0: "where the Olympics are a big

1158
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:27,220
Speaker 0: deal.".

1159
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,100
Speaker 0: "Like, the guy from the poor country,".

1160
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:31,840
Speaker 0: "in the Serbia area or in Africa,".

1161
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,480
Speaker 0: "who trains his whole life,".

1162
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,238
Speaker 0: "and he's the only person from his country,".

1163
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,540
Speaker 0: "representing them in one race,".

1164
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:37,513
Speaker 0: "and he gets the

1165
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:38,000
Speaker 0: bronze.".

1166
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:39,431
Speaker 0: "That's a big deal to those

1167
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:39,774
Speaker 0: people.".

1168
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,340
Speaker 1: "But at the same time--".

1169
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,072
Speaker 1: "I feel bad, though,

1170
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:42,397
Speaker 1: also.".

1171
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:44,758
Speaker 1: "The Olympics is every four years,".

1172
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:47,117
Speaker 1: "so if you participate in one of those sports,".

1173
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,773
Speaker 1: "you have maybe two, three

1174
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:50,518
Speaker 1: tries.".

1175
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,940
Speaker 1: "Three tries is crazy,".

1176
00:39:53,002 --> 00:39:54,216
Speaker 1: "to win a gold medal,".

1177
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:56,596
Speaker 1: "because after that, you're going to be too

1178
00:39:56,778 --> 00:39:56,919
Speaker 1: old.".

1179
00:39:57,181 --> 00:39:58,338
Speaker 0: "Most of these sports, too,".

1180
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:00,840
Speaker 0: "have no other serious outlet,".

1181
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:01,329
Speaker 0: "other than the

1182
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:01,717
Speaker 0: Olympics.".

1183
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:03,176
Speaker 0: "There's sports like hockey,".

1184
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,509
Speaker 0: "where the NHL is where all the real hockey players" "end up,".

1185
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:07,793
Speaker 1: "I think the only--".

1186
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,157
Speaker 1: "Yeah, but the gold medal in hockey is pretty

1187
00:40:11,177 --> 00:40:11,560
Speaker 1: meaningful.".

1188
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,057
Speaker 0: "Yes, but what I'm saying is that,".

1189
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,236
Speaker 0: "a lot of other sports,".

1190
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,880
Speaker 0: "there aren't these gigantic places".

1191
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,097
Speaker 0: "to prove that you're the best,".

1192
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:18,729
Speaker 0: "where people will

1193
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,117
Speaker 0: notice.".

1194
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,675
Speaker 1: "They do, but no one

1195
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:21,079
Speaker 1: notices.".

1196
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,358
Speaker 1: "They're like the World Cup or whatever,".

1197
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,140
Speaker 0: "but they're like--".

1198
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,500
Speaker 0: "Well, that's not a good example,".

1199
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:26,819
Speaker 0: "because the whole world notices that,".

1200
00:40:26,901 --> 00:40:27,208
Speaker 0: "just not

1201
00:40:27,352 --> 00:40:27,434
Speaker 0: us.".

1202
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,273
Speaker 1: "Yeah, pretty

1203
00:40:28,314 --> 00:40:28,519
Speaker 1: much.".

1204
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:33,378
Speaker 1: "Anyway, so I feel bad--".

1205
00:40:33,762 --> 00:40:34,677
Speaker 1: "Look, there's a guy in the US,".

1206
00:40:35,504 --> 00:40:38,100
Speaker 1: "who may be the greatest swimmer ever,".

1207
00:40:38,423 --> 00:40:39,880
Speaker 1: "and he's going to the Olympics this year,".

1208
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,471
Speaker 1: "and he could win,".

1209
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:42,836
Speaker 1: "he could prove that he's the best swimmer ever,".

1210
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:45,300
Speaker 1: "but if the Olympics don't happen,".

1211
00:40:45,522 --> 00:40:46,920
Speaker 1: "or in some way damaged,".

1212
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:49,159
Speaker 1: "he's not going to have another shot,".

1213
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:51,037
Speaker 1: "to prove he's the best swimmer

1214
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:51,259
Speaker 1: ever.".

1215
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,214
Speaker 1: "I mean, imagine if for some reason--".

1216
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:56,400
Speaker 1: "We know Tiger Woods is probably the best golfer ever,".

1217
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:57,075
Speaker 1: "but he is still--".

1218
00:40:57,381 --> 00:40:59,375
Speaker 1: "He's on his way to winning more than anyone else

1219
00:40:59,496 --> 00:40:59,637
Speaker 1: ever.".

1220
00:41:00,101 --> 00:41:02,940
Speaker 1: "What if suddenly the PGA is canceled,".

1221
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,577
Speaker 1: "because of people attacking it for something the PGA didn't

1222
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:07,778
Speaker 1: do?".

1223
00:41:08,462 --> 00:41:09,474
Speaker 1: "Then that's like--".

1224
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,256
Speaker 1: "I don't feel bad for maybe the PGA,".

1225
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,356
Speaker 1: "but I feel bad for Tiger

1226
00:41:12,397 --> 00:41:12,540
Speaker 1: Woods.".

1227
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,718
Speaker 0: "Yeah, because then at the same time,".

1228
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,376
Speaker 0: "it's like, yeah, the IOC, they did agree to put it in

1229
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:17,020
Speaker 0: Beijing.".

1230
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:18,316
Speaker 1: "Right, they did, I

1231
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,458
Speaker 1: know.".

1232
00:41:18,721 --> 00:41:20,354
Speaker 0: "It's not like they couldn't have foreseen this

1233
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:20,858
Speaker 0: happening.".

1234
00:41:21,201 --> 00:41:23,919
Speaker 1: "So it's like, if athletes are whipping out Tibetan flags,".

1235
00:41:24,121 --> 00:41:24,449
Speaker 1: "totally

1236
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:24,879
Speaker 1: awesome.".

1237
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:27,279
Speaker 1: "And people running with the torch,".

1238
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,200
Speaker 1: "whipping out Tibetan flags--".

1239
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,832
Speaker 0: "Which has already

1240
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:29,220
Speaker 0: happened.".

1241
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,090
Speaker 1: "Totally awesome,

1242
00:41:30,414 --> 00:41:30,636
Speaker 1: right?".

1243
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:32,580
Speaker 1: "People trying to put out the torch,".

1244
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:34,280
Speaker 1: "that goes a little over the line for me,".

1245
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,560
Speaker 1: "because you're assaulting this person,".

1246
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,550
Speaker 1: "who just wants to carry a

1247
00:41:36,611 --> 00:41:37,015
Speaker 1: torch.".

1248
00:41:38,202 --> 00:41:39,960
Speaker 1: "People standing near the torch protesting,".

1249
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:40,408
Speaker 1: "totally

1250
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,815
Speaker 1: awesome.".

1251
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:42,656
Speaker 1: "To me--" "People going to the Olympics and

1252
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:42,880
Speaker 1: protesting.".

1253
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,299
Speaker 0: "It always bothers me that whenever there's a real issue,".

1254
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,077
Speaker 0: "that you could really--".

1255
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,059
Speaker 0: "like, there's an easy way to stand behind it,".

1256
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,770
Speaker 0: "and protest or

1257
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:49,054
Speaker 0: anything.".

1258
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:51,179
Speaker 0: "It seems like the majority of people protest,".

1259
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,620
Speaker 0: "in this really shoddy, just-making-themselves,".

1260
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:55,514
Speaker 0: "almost-look-bad

1261
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:55,697
Speaker 0: way.".

1262
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:59,420
Speaker 0: "To me, the best protest they could have had," "is if no one attacked the torch,".

1263
00:41:59,662 --> 00:42:00,938
Speaker 0: "and there weren't these giant yelling

1264
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:01,120
Speaker 0: mobs.".

1265
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,378
Speaker 0: "If there was just--".

1266
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:02,994
Speaker 1: "If no one showed

1267
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:03,158
Speaker 1: up.".

1268
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:06,200
Speaker 0: "Or just a silent crowd turns its back,".

1269
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,276
Speaker 0: "as they present the

1270
00:42:07,296 --> 00:42:07,580
Speaker 0: torch.".

1271
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:08,051
Speaker 1: "See, there you

1272
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:08,297
Speaker 1: go.".

1273
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:09,960
Speaker 0: "But no one does anything cool like that,".

1274
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:10,715
Speaker 0: "No one really

1275
00:42:10,797 --> 00:42:10,960
Speaker 0: protests.".

1276
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,980
Speaker 1: "But because, to do something complicated,".

1277
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,799
Speaker 1: "with the larger group you have,".

1278
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,671
Speaker 1: "it becomes more and more

1279
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:16,096
Speaker 1: difficult.".

1280
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,278
Speaker 1: "That's why you can get a million people to chant,".

1281
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,939
Speaker 1: "like, 'Kill, kill, kill,' but it's--".

1282
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,639
Speaker 1: "Or, 'Free Tibet,' but--".

1283
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:23,718
Speaker 0: "It's a lot harder to get them to

1284
00:42:23,738 --> 00:42:23,840
Speaker 0: chant.".

1285
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,579
Speaker 0: "It's a lot harder to get--".

1286
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,592
Speaker 0: "Come and see the violence inherent in the

1287
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:25,957
Speaker 0: system.".

1288
00:42:26,261 --> 00:42:27,897
Speaker 0: "Come and see the violence inherent in the

1289
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:28,180
Speaker 0: system.".

1290
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,738
Speaker 1: "And it's even harder to get them to say,".

1291
00:42:30,122 --> 00:42:30,994
Speaker 1: "E to the X, T, X, T, Y, to--".

1292
00:42:30,994 --> 00:42:33,898
Speaker 0: "1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, Z, K, N, cosine, tangent, sine--".

1293
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:35,516
Speaker 1: "Aye, aye, times 3,

1294
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:35,739
Speaker 1: anyway.".

1295
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,534
Speaker 0: "Let's go, let's go, we totally stole that from

1296
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:37,938
Speaker 0: MIT.".

1297
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:38,614
Speaker 1: "Yeah!".

1298
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:40,148
Speaker 1: "I love

1299
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:40,513
Speaker 1: RIT.".

1300
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:41,770
Speaker 1: "Yep.".

1301
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,118
Speaker 1: "So, the thing is, this whole thing,".

1302
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,639
Speaker 1: "and totally for free in Tibet,".

1303
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:48,900
Speaker 1: "I really don't know why China tries to hold on Tibet,".

1304
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,514
Speaker 1: "it just makes them look bad, it doesn't get them

1305
00:42:50,574 --> 00:42:50,756
Speaker 1: much.".

1306
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,720
Speaker 1: "But, really, some of the protesters,".

1307
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,780
Speaker 1: "I feel like there is the spirit of the Olympics,".

1308
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:03,856
Speaker 1: "and the athletes participating in the Olympics," "have been made a victim, perhaps

1309
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:04,640
Speaker 1: unnecessarily.".

1310
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,659
Speaker 0: "But, at the same time,".

1311
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:11,517
Speaker 0: "I feel as though the spirit of the Olympics," "has been all but dead for a long, long

1312
00:43:11,618 --> 00:43:12,000
Speaker 0: time.".

1313
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:13,540
Speaker 1: "Yeah, and I think what they're sort of doing,".

1314
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:16,800
Speaker 1: "is they're going and kicking the tombstone over it,".

1315
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,167
Speaker 1: "and I'm like,

1316
00:43:17,187 --> 00:43:17,595
Speaker 1: 'Ahh.'".

1317
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,492
Speaker 1: "Plus, at the same time," "Don't make me feel

1318
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:19,859
Speaker 1: worse.".

1319
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,838
Speaker 0: "There is kind of the idea,".

1320
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:22,240
Speaker 0: "I'm not advocating anything,".

1321
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:23,092
Speaker 0: "but the idea that,".

1322
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:26,840
Speaker 0: "well, if something is morally opposed to you,".

1323
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,540
Speaker 0: "it's almost like you look at cultural relativism,".

1324
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,418
Speaker 0: "like, if there's something bad going on,".

1325
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,460
Speaker 0: "why should you respect someone,".

1326
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:37,160
Speaker 0: "like, alright, let's not talk about this for today,".

1327
00:43:37,566 --> 00:43:38,238
Speaker 0: "and just chill,".

1328
00:43:38,502 --> 00:43:39,900
Speaker 0: "and I'll ignore the bad thing,".

1329
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,396
Speaker 0: "and then we'll talk about the bad thing again

1330
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:41,780
Speaker 0: tomorrow.".

1331
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,236
Speaker 0: "I feel like the freedom of speech always

1332
00:43:44,276 --> 00:43:44,598
Speaker 0: trumps.".

1333
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,598
Speaker 1: "Well, I think the reason that in the end,".

1334
00:43:47,921 --> 00:43:49,700
Speaker 1: "I have to go to the protester's side,".

1335
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:54,239
Speaker 1: "even though I feel the spirit of the Olympics," "is an unfair victim,".

1336
00:43:54,722 --> 00:43:59,600
Speaker 1: "is that if you told me that sacrificing the Olympics,".

1337
00:43:59,924 --> 00:44:00,698
Speaker 1: "would free Tibet,".

1338
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:02,159
Speaker 1: "make the Olympics a martyr,".

1339
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,839
Speaker 1: "Tibet is free,".

1340
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:03,649
Speaker 1: "I'd say,

1341
00:44:04,053 --> 00:44:04,417
Speaker 1: okay.".

1342
00:44:05,407 --> 00:44:06,417
Speaker 1: "That's a good trade

1343
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:06,680
Speaker 1: there.".

1344
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:07,585
Speaker 0: "That's

1345
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:07,889
Speaker 0: fair.".

1346
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:10,690
Speaker 0: "It's just,".

1347
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,339
Speaker 0: "I always err on freedom of speech anyway,".

1348
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:15,516
Speaker 0: "and regardless of all of it,".

1349
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,900
Speaker 0: "I feel as though,".

1350
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:20,291
Speaker 1: "Freedom of speech, ironically enough," "something China doesn't

1351
00:44:20,332 --> 00:44:20,554
Speaker 1: have.".

1352
00:44:22,364 --> 00:44:24,580
Speaker 0: "I also feel as though China brought this on themselves,".

1353
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:28,351
Speaker 0: "not for any reason other than the fact," "that when this started,".

1354
00:44:31,928 --> 00:44:34,079
Speaker 0: "all China would have had to do," "was open up a dialogue,".

1355
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,078
Speaker 0: "and say something like,".

1356
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,719
Speaker 0: "Wow, the world has risen up,".

1357
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,496
Speaker 0: "and said we're going to,".

1358
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:42,359
Speaker 0: "let's let the Olympics happen,".

1359
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:43,333
Speaker 0: "for the athletes,".

1360
00:44:44,243 --> 00:44:47,060
Speaker 0: "and then we're going to seriously sit down,".

1361
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:48,378
Speaker 0: "and solve Tibet,".

1362
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,592
Speaker 0: "so that everyone can be

1363
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:49,955
Speaker 0: happy.".

1364
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,694
Speaker 0: "But instead, China said," "they said these stupid

1365
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:54,158
Speaker 0: statements.".

1366
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,258
Speaker 1: "The only statement,".

1367
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:56,294
Speaker 1: "they said like a hundred

1368
00:44:56,334 --> 00:44:56,720
Speaker 1: statements.".

1369
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,580
Speaker 0: "They said it hurts the feelings of the Chinese,".

1370
00:44:58,824 --> 00:44:59,577
Speaker 0: "and one China,".

1371
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,294
Speaker 1: "and that's all they

1372
00:45:00,315 --> 00:45:00,458
Speaker 1: said.".

1373
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,120
Speaker 1: "The only non-stupid thing they said was," "you're holding the Olympics hostage,".

1374
00:45:04,324 --> 00:45:04,670
Speaker 1: "which is

1375
00:45:04,813 --> 00:45:05,017
Speaker 1: true.".

1376
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:05,957
Speaker 0: "But at the same time,".

1377
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,780
Speaker 0: "like Scott said," "if holding the Olympics hostage,".

1378
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:10,558
Speaker 0: "this is for people who have been,".

1379
00:45:11,102 --> 00:45:13,480
Speaker 0: "so disempowered for so long,".

1380
00:45:13,863 --> 00:45:16,140
Speaker 0: "I mean, no matter how angry you were about Tibet,".

1381
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,034
Speaker 0: "there was nothing you could do,".

1382
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,619
Speaker 0: "suddenly, there's a very easy way,".

1383
00:45:19,881 --> 00:45:22,080
Speaker 0: "to do a lot of harm to China,".

1384
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:23,655
Speaker 0: "in terms of getting something

1385
00:45:23,695 --> 00:45:24,240
Speaker 0: accomplished.".

1386
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,957
Speaker 1: "The thing that really bothers me the most,".

1387
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:27,416
Speaker 1: "about China in general,".

1388
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:30,176
Speaker 1: "is that a lot of the things China does,".

1389
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,339
Speaker 1: "you know, they do a lot of smart things,".

1390
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,030
Speaker 1: "for themselves,

1391
00:45:33,132 --> 00:45:33,315
Speaker 1: right?".

1392
00:45:33,761 --> 00:45:35,939
Speaker 1: "But they do a lot of stupid things,".

1393
00:45:36,161 --> 00:45:38,857
Speaker 1: "for like these seemingly like reasons of

1394
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:39,320
Speaker 1: pride.".

1395
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:41,496
Speaker 1: "Like, why are you still acting that way with

1396
00:45:41,536 --> 00:45:41,979
Speaker 1: Taiwan?".

1397
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,416
Speaker 1: "Like, just give it up and you'll be

1398
00:45:44,477 --> 00:45:44,799
Speaker 1: fine.".

1399
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:46,176
Speaker 1: "Just say, okay, we don't

1400
00:45:46,196 --> 00:45:46,398
Speaker 1: care.".

1401
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:47,271
Speaker 1: "Go be your own

1402
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:47,616
Speaker 1: country.".

1403
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,175
Speaker 1: "You know, it wouldn't hurt

1404
00:45:49,317 --> 00:45:49,540
Speaker 1: China.".

1405
00:45:49,641 --> 00:45:50,877
Speaker 1: "It would help them a lot to say

1406
00:45:50,897 --> 00:45:51,059
Speaker 1: that.".

1407
00:45:51,322 --> 00:45:52,899
Speaker 1: "But the only reason they don't is,".

1408
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,496
Speaker 1: "you know, some nationalistic crazy

1409
00:45:55,616 --> 00:45:56,059
Speaker 1: reasons.".

1410
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,660
Speaker 0: "The only smart thing they've ever done,".

1411
00:45:57,741 --> 00:45:59,200
Speaker 0: "in that regard was with Hong Kong,".

1412
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,776
Speaker 0: "how they largely left Hong Kong

1413
00:46:00,836 --> 00:46:01,099
Speaker 0: alone.".

1414
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,479
Speaker 1: "Yeah, if they would have just let Tibet go,".

1415
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,440
Speaker 1: "it wouldn't hurt China, really,".

1416
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:06,573
Speaker 1: "except for their

1417
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:07,119
Speaker 1: pride.".

1418
00:46:07,341 --> 00:46:10,059
Speaker 0: "Imagine if, if I were China,".

1419
00:46:11,264 --> 00:46:12,038
Speaker 0: "let's say, all right,".

1420
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:13,558
Speaker 0: "if I were the premier of China,".

1421
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:14,636
Speaker 0: "what I would have done,".

1422
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:16,580
Speaker 0: "is I would have made a big deal,".

1423
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,136
Speaker 0: "like we're going to talk about this,".

1424
00:46:18,602 --> 00:46:22,479
Speaker 0: "and I would step forward and say," "you know, I've heard blah, blah, blah,".

1425
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:24,379
Speaker 0: "it's time for all of this to end,".

1426
00:46:25,004 --> 00:46:26,700
Speaker 0: "this will be the Tibetan Olympics,".

1427
00:46:27,641 --> 00:46:30,340
Speaker 0: "and we will end it with the turning over,".

1428
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,415
Speaker 0: "of civil authority to the nation of

1429
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:32,898
Speaker 0: Tibet.".

1430
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,079
Speaker 0: "Like, I would have made a big deal about

1431
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:35,140
Speaker 0: it.".

1432
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:36,672
Speaker 0: "That would have turned China into,".

1433
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:39,338
Speaker 0: "the amount of goodwill that that would have

1434
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:39,560
Speaker 0: generated.".

1435
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,718
Speaker 1: "And if you did that,".

1436
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,880
Speaker 1: "you wouldn't even have to clean up your civil rights,".

1437
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:44,815
Speaker 1: "even though I still think you

1438
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:45,058
Speaker 1: should.".

1439
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,539
Speaker 0: "No, but China, the Olympics then,".

1440
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:50,800
Speaker 0: "would have become like this historical Olympics,".

1441
00:46:51,123 --> 00:46:51,709
Speaker 0: "like times a

1442
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:52,316
Speaker 0: billion.".

1443
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,920
Speaker 0: "And China would stand to gain nothing,".

1444
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:56,340
Speaker 0: "but, I don't know, everything,".

1445
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:57,719
Speaker 0: "by doing something like that,".

1446
00:46:58,021 --> 00:47:00,600
Speaker 0: "but instead, you've hurt the feelings of China,".

1447
00:47:00,723 --> 00:47:01,540
Speaker 0: "and won China,".

1448
00:47:01,661 --> 00:47:02,953
Speaker 0: "and don't you dare hurt the

1449
00:47:02,973 --> 00:47:03,397
Speaker 0: Olympics.".

1450
00:47:04,105 --> 00:47:05,139
Speaker 0: "I don't know why China has,".

1451
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,314
Speaker 0: "I don't even know what kind of accent that

1452
00:47:06,354 --> 00:47:06,557
Speaker 0: was.".

1453
00:47:07,002 --> 00:47:08,454
Speaker 0: "Don't you dare hurt the

1454
00:47:08,474 --> 00:47:08,857
Speaker 0: Olympics.".

1455
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,187
Speaker 0: "You're very

1456
00:47:10,268 --> 00:47:10,592
Speaker 0: angry.".

1457
00:47:11,966 --> 00:47:13,199
Speaker 1: "And it's like, you know,".

1458
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,980
Speaker 1: "China has all their non-free speech,".

1459
00:47:18,264 --> 00:47:19,815
Speaker 1: "and human rights violations and

1460
00:47:19,855 --> 00:47:20,137
Speaker 1: such.".

1461
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:25,540
Speaker 1: I mean, that sort of made sense when you're like an evil communist dictatorship, right?

1462
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:36,598
Speaker 1: And you sort of, you know, if the people know too much and they escape your propaganda, then it'll fall apart, sort of like what happened in Russia or what could happen in North Korea, which is even worse.

1463
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,191
Speaker 0: Someday.

1464
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:38,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, someday.

1465
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,420
Speaker 0: Man, North Korea is one of the only things in the world that actually frightens me.

1466
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,200
Speaker 0: It's pretty scary.

1467
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,780
Speaker 0: Not because I'm afraid of their WMDs or anything, because I know they don't have anything.

1468
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,960
Speaker 0: Just because the idea that a 1984-ish Orwellian state exists.

1469
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:51,999
Speaker 0: It's right there.

1470
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:59,419
Speaker 0: There are people stuck in it who probably don't know a lot about the outside world, and to date, no one's really been able to do anything about it.

1471
00:48:00,886 --> 00:48:04,060
Speaker 1: But China doesn't need to be doing these human rights violations today.

1472
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,380
Speaker 1: I mean, the Internet's there.

1473
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:08,420
Speaker 1: They have a great firewall, but that's really -- it's not helping.

1474
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,096
Speaker 1: I mean, they could just give it up, and it wouldn't ruin anything.

1475
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's tricky, but China is a thing for another -- They would be just fine.

1476
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,859
Speaker 1: China's a thing -- They'd be better off letting it go.

1477
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:18,839
Speaker 0: For another show.

1478
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,160
Speaker 0: Because, frankly, it's Thursday.

1479
00:48:21,881 --> 00:48:26,320
Speaker 0: I'm really hungry, and we have a reason to celebrate, so I kind of want to go get a whole bunch of food.

1480
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,399
Speaker 0: Unrelated -- we got some good news in between the front bit and the second bit of the show.

1481
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:32,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1482
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:33,079
Speaker 0: So let's just eat?

1483
00:48:33,445 --> 00:48:33,680
Speaker 1: Yes.

1484
00:48:33,884 --> 00:48:34,038
Speaker 0: Okay.

1485
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:35,700
Speaker 0: See you at the New York Comic-Con.

1486
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,879
Speaker 0: Don't forget to bother the Ninja Consultants.

1487
00:48:38,203 --> 00:48:38,580
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

1488
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:47,220
Speaker 0: This has been "Geek Nights" with Rim and Scott.

1489
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,880
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1492
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,099
Speaker 0: Mondays are science and technology.

Speaker 0: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1494
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:18,660
Speaker 0: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1501

Speaker 1: "Geek Nights" is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1502
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,540
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
