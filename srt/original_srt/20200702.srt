1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,464
Speaker 1: It's Thursday July 2nd 2020.

2
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:11,866
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:14,238
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:18,919
Speaker 1: tonight We're talking about those food subscription boxes that Millennials are so excited about.

5
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:21,217
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:27,415
Speaker 1: So something weird happened to me over the last few days like this.

7
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:28,699
Speaker 1: There was a minor drama.

8
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:31,615
Speaker 1: So Several a few days ago in the evening.

9
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:32,540
Speaker 1: I'm gonna cook something, right?

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:45,323
Speaker 1: so I I start some water boiling like on the stove like you do and I set the oven to preheat like you do and As the oven starts preheating the oven smells weird Not like gas.

11
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:47,570
Speaker 1: It does not smell like unburnt gas.

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,874
Speaker 1: So that's that is not.

13
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:50,920
Speaker 1: that is not something I would miss identify.

14
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:53,560
Speaker 0: I even go like in the oven that was burning.

15
00:00:53,721 --> 00:01:06,740
Speaker 1: that was that was my first thought because I grew up in the Midwest and for those of you who don't know it is Weirdly common in the Midwest for people to store their bread and even sometimes other groceries in the oven.

16
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:12,496
Speaker 0: I do not do that or if I ever done that I don't think people do that except in the Midwest.

17
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:13,601
Speaker 1: but in the Midwest It's a.

18
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:17,777
Speaker 0: that's definitely a dumb idea or unless you never use your oven ever.

19
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:18,198
Speaker 0: Yep.

20
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:24,291
Speaker 1: So as a kid I just remembered anytime I was gonna use the oven I'd open it I take out like whatever bread was in there and then I'd preheat the oven.

21
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:32,765
Speaker 1: so to this day if you ever watched like As an adult this is so ingrained in my head for being a kid in the Midwest watch anytime I'm gonna preheat the oven.

22
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:33,770
Speaker 1: I hit preheat.

23
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:35,580
Speaker 1: I start it and then I open the oven.

24
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,209
Speaker 1: I look inside and then I close it again.

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,879
Speaker 1: It's just a habit that I'll never break.

26
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:41,811
Speaker 1: I don't store anything in my fucking oven because I'm not.

27
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:47,700
Speaker 0: I mean I before I use the oven I also open it to check inside to make sure the racks are in the correct position.

28
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:50,899
Speaker 0: Nah, true true was that I want to move them way after they heat up.

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:59,040
Speaker 1: But the inside of the oven smells really weird and night and it vaguely smells like either burning plastic or like really messed up food.

30
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,960
Speaker 1: Like I wasn't sure but it wasn't a super strong smell, but it was there.

31
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:07,775
Speaker 1: So I look around the oven like that I'd like did something fall off the pan the last time I was using the oven?

32
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:11,929
Speaker 1: like I didn't see any new Black marks or new garbage or anything in there.

33
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,414
Speaker 1: I fudged around a little.

34
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:22,046
Speaker 0: I even open the bottom door Like to check to see that the flame was something on top of the oven because sometimes when I use my oven it gets really Hot on top of the rain.

35
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, the heat comes up through the.

36
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:25,319
Speaker 1: you know, I checked up there, too.

37
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,448
Speaker 1: There was not a problem that I could see.

38
00:02:27,468 --> 00:02:30,480
Speaker 1: I even open that little door though to check like what color was the flame?

39
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,522
Speaker 1: Inside the oven?

40
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:39,129
Speaker 1: because if the actual flame in the oven is not the the right orange or blue you're getting incomplete combustion Which is a big problem, but everything was fine there.

41
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:41,620
Speaker 1: So I just cooked with this weird smell.

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,484
Speaker 1: I didn't think about it.

43
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:44,191
Speaker 0: Wouldn't it make your food taste bad.

44
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,116
Speaker 0: It didn't like.

45
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:45,758
Speaker 1: it was fine.

46
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,900
Speaker 0: Okay I would not cook with a weird smell out of fear.

47
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:53,679
Speaker 1: It wasn't that strong of a smell and it got a little weaker like later after the oven was preheated.

48
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,631
Speaker 1: So I figured all right, I'll deal with that later.

49
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,836
Speaker 1: Like I got to clean the oven.

50
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:58,760
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's been a while.

51
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:03,911
Speaker 1: next day Emily's cooking and I'm in here like messing with stuff and she comes in.

52
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:06,342
Speaker 1: she's like the oven smells really weird Like this.

53
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:08,931
Speaker 1: the range smells really weird, but she was not using the oven.

54
00:03:09,654 --> 00:03:11,180
Speaker 1: She was just using the cooktop.

55
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:17,840
Speaker 1: Okay, so I come out and sure enough it smells like the same weird smell that came out of the oven the previous day.

56
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:18,984
Speaker 1: It's now coming.

57
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:22,035
Speaker 1: It smells like it's coming out of the fire itself.

58
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:25,366
Speaker 1: on the top of the stove There's something in the gas.

59
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:25,989
Speaker 0: That wasn't good.

60
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, so at that point that's where it was a weird thing.

61
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,220
Speaker 1: And so I start googling around because it the best way I could describe the smell.

62
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:37,877
Speaker 1: Then when I really like this has happened two days in a row and it's not just the oven.

63
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,624
Speaker 1: This is weird I went from.

64
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:41,530
Speaker 1: I'll keep an eye on the situation to.

65
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:45,665
Speaker 1: I need to actively investigate the situation Because I don't like.

66
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,631
Speaker 1: this is something that I do not have knowledge of.

67
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:50,520
Speaker 1: so I googled for and this is where it was funny.

68
00:03:50,901 --> 00:04:01,491
Speaker 1: I started googling for like kerosene smell from and Google recommended natural gas stove immediately And there's a million results for that exact question.

69
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,858
Speaker 0: People will say Google for like contaminated.

70
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:19,733
Speaker 1: Yes I mean I googled for all those sorts of things but everyone keep kept like a Vaguely kerosene or like bad propane or a smell in that class coming from a Gas a natural gas normal stove that previously never had a smell like that.

71
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:25,420
Speaker 1: and I found a million results mostly in places like Quora or like Yahoo!

72
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:32,114
Speaker 1: ask or reddit or stack exchanges where people were like Why is my oven smelling like this suddenly?

73
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:33,200
Speaker 1: and about half of them were?

74
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:44,738
Speaker 1: People bought a brand new oven and it smells like that for the first like month when you use it And then it just kind of stops smelling like that, but we've been using this same stove and oven for like 11 years.

75
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:49,553
Speaker 1: We've not replaced like the starter or anything in it like it.

76
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,904
Speaker 1: I don't use oven cleaner in it Like I don't use it.

77
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:53,614
Speaker 1: cleaning cycle done nothing weird to this thing.

78
00:04:54,459 --> 00:05:01,928
Speaker 1: So the other reason most people say it has this smell is Something that I never even considered.

79
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,080
Speaker 1: so the stories all went the same way.

80
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:23,830
Speaker 1: The smell started happening and then when I scroll all the way down through the comments at the bottom the answer was I figured it out and it was always something like I painted my basement or I painted like a room in my house or I varnished my floors and My oven smelled like this.

81
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:31,776
Speaker 1: for like three weeks afterward I ended up finding some gas websites like gas company websites that had facts that even had things like.

82
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:34,944
Speaker 1: if you smell a smell like This here are the likely causes.

83
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:40,179
Speaker 1: and the first question they ask in those facts when you're trying to troubleshoot is have you painted or?

84
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,853
Speaker 1: Varnished anything in your house recently?

85
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:43,820
Speaker 0: did they paint in the hallway?

86
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,284
Speaker 1: Finally, they paid.

87
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,955
Speaker 1: the apartment next to us is empty and is currently being completely repainted.

88
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,580
Speaker 0: All right, you got to air it out.

89
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:56,899
Speaker 1: So apparently what happens is the paint smell was gone at this point like they're done painting that.

90
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:57,922
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah But it's still.

91
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,665
Speaker 0: it's still around.

92
00:05:58,765 --> 00:05:59,447
Speaker 1: it's around so it.

93
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:02,980
Speaker 1: apparently it hangs around for like a month and you'll never smell it or notice.

94
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:14,959
Speaker 1: but if you have Exposed open flames they will combust those particles that you can't smell and they will make this very specific kerosene esque odor.

95
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:24,879
Speaker 1: so because our neighbor's apartment was being painted our gas stove smells like kerosene and Probably will for another couple weeks.

96
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,677
Speaker 0: Why just open the windows and blow some fans?

97
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,180
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

98
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,125
Speaker 1: So now I open though.

99
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:30,513
Speaker 1: I mean it's hot and don't you have that?

100
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:31,760
Speaker 0: you have an air filter thing, too.

101
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:37,080
Speaker 1: That air filter will not remove those types of things unless I put a different filter in it.

102
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,180
Speaker 1: That's expensive and that's not a common problem.

103
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:50,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we opened all the windows and the smell went down but it's still there and like it's lower and I guess I have to wait a couple weeks for it to completely dissipate.

104
00:06:51,802 --> 00:07:02,260
Speaker 1: Okay, some people reported it took like two or three months But those people had done things like painted sealant over the walls of their entire basements Hmm.

105
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:03,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was so.

106
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:08,895
Speaker 1: if you ever have a gas stove that never smelled like kerosene before in one day It smells like kerosene.

107
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:11,258
Speaker 1: Did you paint your house recently?

108
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,922
Speaker 0: Did you paint anything?

109
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:14,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you paint something?

110
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,277
Speaker 1: I feel like the wrong Gundam kit could cause this problem.

111
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:29,300
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, the only the only open e type bit I have is that you know since going outside is kind of dangerous I don't do that too much right and I don't have to go to work in an office and not so I'm not biking there.

112
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,220
Speaker 0: You know, I've been riding the inside bike ever since my building reopened the guy.

113
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:36,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, the inside bike, you know, it's not that fun.

114
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,516
Speaker 0: But it's you know, it's more fun.

115
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:39,760
Speaker 1: No, but I've been forced myself.

116
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,300
Speaker 1: I've been biking outside every weekend instead and running outside avoiding people.

117
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:53,440
Speaker 0: So I biked on the the nowhere bike that go with the bike to nowhere like every day, you know for like You know, I guess six days a week except for there was one day.

118
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,220
Speaker 0: I guess I missed one day out of it was one week.

119
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,853
Speaker 0: I only did five days cuz I got really tired and I couldn't.

120
00:07:59,175 --> 00:07:59,778
Speaker 0: I was like that happens.

121
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,247
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, I mean how crazy I'm about running.

122
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:05,097
Speaker 1: I don't run every day some days.

123
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:05,880
Speaker 1: I'm just like, you know what?

124
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:07,788
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna play video games and go to sleep.

125
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:10,420
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, I just figured it's like I'm not biking that much, right?

126
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:21,746
Speaker 0: It was I was used to bike every day almost every day anyway, so now today, you know they the guy I'm in the building got closed because You know virus right.

127
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:24,196
Speaker 0: and then they're like, okay, we're reopening it today.

128
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,020
Speaker 0: They send an email.

129
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:28,393
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the health department came and said they're gonna find us unless we close it.

130
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:29,136
Speaker 0: They closed it again.

131
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:30,140
Speaker 1: interesting.

132
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:38,080
Speaker 0: so And I guess tomorrow I'm gonna maybe try to just go outside and be like, well see what's it.

133
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:49,440
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what the rule there is because when I read the like the regulations that were passed in New York It seemed to imply that like those kinds of rules technically only applied to like commercial public.

134
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:56,580
Speaker 0: That's what I thought - this is an in the building gym Not a you know, yeah my building's gym has definitely not closed.

135
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:56,962
Speaker 1: I won't.

136
00:08:57,022 --> 00:09:00,360
Speaker 1: I'm not using it one cuz it's small like it's basically just this atrium.

137
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:05,330
Speaker 1: But the rule their rule is basically you have to wear a mask while you're in there and only one person can be in there at a time.

138
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,113
Speaker 0: ours is just.

139
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,905
Speaker 0: it was open and Ours is basically.

140
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:12,415
Speaker 0: it's like it's an apartment where they just took the walls down.

141
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,700
Speaker 1: Oh, no, that's way worse.

142
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:16,397
Speaker 1: Ours is like like was made to be a gym room.

143
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:16,840
Speaker 0: It's a large.

144
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,850
Speaker 0: It was a large apartment where the walls were taking.

145
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,453
Speaker 0: there's a lot of stuff.

146
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:20,960
Speaker 0: ours is like this a dream in a sock.

147
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,253
Speaker 0: It's like an atrium connected to the building like a sauna and a bathroom in it.

148
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:27,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm a little jealous of that sauna.

149
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,547
Speaker 1: We don't got anything like that.

150
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:29,453
Speaker 0: I've never used it.

151
00:09:29,473 --> 00:09:30,560
Speaker 0: I've never seen anyone use it.

152
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,810
Speaker 1: I would use it if you if I don't know how to use it.

153
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:35,020
Speaker 0: It's gonna use it properly.

154
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:39,020
Speaker 1: Uh, I I would gladly teach you if I could use your sauna.

155
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:44,977
Speaker 0: They say that no, I would let you come and teach me to use the sauna But there's actually a rule that visitors may not use.

156
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:50,220
Speaker 1: the guy Our jail building has that rule but I've often let people who visit us use our guy.

157
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,928
Speaker 1: I'm because they don't care.

158
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:52,060
Speaker 0: sure we could get away with it.

159
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,454
Speaker 0: But yeah, it has like a temperature setting and it's like what do I set it to?

160
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:55,720
Speaker 0: 100 200?

161
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,483
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you don't want it.

162
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could.

163
00:09:57,788 --> 00:10:01,062
Speaker 1: you could possibly pass out and have a problem if you don't know what the head It's like.

164
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:05,020
Speaker 0: and then there's like, you know, it's got the little thing where you pour the water with from the bucket with.

165
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,224
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got to be careful with that.

166
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:12,592
Speaker 1: noobs will do things like pour splash a bunch of water on it And that is not what you want.

167
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:12,794
Speaker 1: Yeah.

168
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:13,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

169
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,220
Speaker 0: So I think maybe I could just watch a YouTube video like how to sauna with some finish first.

170
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,473
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's some amazing finish video that is like here is how to sauna.

171
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:23,485
Speaker 1: that is funny and wrong and another one That is extremely correct.

172
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,920
Speaker 0: But the thing is I think their demo sauna would be much higher quality than the one.

173
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:33,542
Speaker 1: I am actually impressed that you have a real sauna because almost every apartment building I've ever seen in New York does not have a Real sauna.

174
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:39,664
Speaker 1: they have a hotel sauna that is designed to make sure that even idiots cannot hurt themselves Where you turn a dial.

175
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:40,908
Speaker 1: that is just a timer.

176
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:43,716
Speaker 1: You can't customize the temperature and there's no rocks.

177
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,687
Speaker 0: Oh, no No, this is a. this is like a little.

178
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:48,776
Speaker 0: it's like a little room made like the size of a small.

179
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:49,699
Speaker 0: that's good wood walls.

180
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, it wouldn't.

181
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:52,128
Speaker 0: I mean it's.

182
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:54,620
Speaker 0: it's like a door to get a glass door to get in there.

183
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,805
Speaker 0: So you can see what's going on in there.

184
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:56,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's.

185
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,700
Speaker 0: there's two levels of wooden bench, right?

186
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,988
Speaker 0: There's like tier one and tier two and in the corner next to the door is I don't know if it's rocks But it's definitely the place where you can dump water.

187
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:10,580
Speaker 0: and on the outside next to the door is a little control panel where?

188
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,242
Speaker 0: You can set.

189
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:13,088
Speaker 1: you know, that's so nice.

190
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:15,114
Speaker 1: I will say what is it?

191
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:15,817
Speaker 0: But there it is.

192
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:26,000
Speaker 1: I uh once in my life III was party to and Smartly fled from before consequences occurred a sauna incidents.

193
00:11:27,342 --> 00:11:30,173
Speaker 1: Well, our marching band was up in Canada for some competition.

194
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:31,318
Speaker 1: I don't remember what.

195
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:41,997
Speaker 1: so like 250 high schoolers are in this hotel in Canada and it had a sauna and the entire percussion group plus me and I like a couple trouble players.

196
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:42,980
Speaker 1: We're all in the sauna.

197
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:55,832
Speaker 1: I'll summarize the story an unnamed individual who is not me and not someone I was a fan of stood up walked over toward the rocks and Clearly was about to pee on them.

198
00:11:56,858 --> 00:12:01,680
Speaker 1: Oh, I I Got the eye of the other trouble players with me.

199
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,491
Speaker 1: I was like we gotta get out of here and he was like what?

200
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:06,229
Speaker 1: well and I pointed he was like Oh shit, and we ran.

201
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:17,610
Speaker 1: I Don't know exactly how it went down But everyone inside started screaming and they could not all get out of the sauna because they blocked the door Falling over each other.

202
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,456
Speaker 1: It was chaos.

203
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, that person should be my advice to anyone out there.

204
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:27,398
Speaker 1: Do not pee on the sauna rocks trust or the electric fence.

205
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:36,860
Speaker 1: Yeah So in some news that may affect some of you many of you Actually a lot of you way more of you than I expected subscribe to my Twitter block list.

206
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:39,086
Speaker 1: Now my block list is not like.

207
00:12:39,728 --> 00:13:10,619
Speaker 1: it's not a block list that I need to protect myself so much as I have added Groups of harassing accounts to it over the years to help my friends protect themselves like notably I created this thing way back when that whole Vic thing was going on and I wrote a Python script and used some Logic to find basically every shithead in that area of the internet and add them all to a block list that other people could subscribe to and a surprising number of people in the anime world Subscribed to it and those kids didn't realize that everyone they were trying to harass couldn't see them anymore.

208
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:17,337
Speaker 1: But block together the service I used to do this is shutting down and the main reason they're shutting down.

209
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:25,141
Speaker 1: Is that The technology they've deployed could probably have been done better like you and I if we made a similar service could have architected a lot Better.

210
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:30,620
Speaker 1: but also Twitter has locked down their API's to make it a giant pain in the ass to do anything like this.

211
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,873
Speaker 0: So I really don't understand.

212
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:43,135
Speaker 0: It's like Twitter, you know There's always been this pattern of businesses technology companies right where when they start out They're open source free.

213
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:48,369
Speaker 0: a guy Do something cool by being so open and so free.

214
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,820
Speaker 0: right people come to their platform and build upon it for free.

215
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,322
Speaker 0: Helping.

216
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:55,150
Speaker 0: it's like giving them free labor right.

217
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:57,420
Speaker 1: the Twitter API used to do a lot.

218
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,835
Speaker 0: It was used to do everything you could do on Twitter.

219
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:07,017
Speaker 0: You could do with the API And then they get big and then once people are big they're saying okay, we gotta lock it down.

220
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:08,060
Speaker 0: We got to charge money.

221
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,836
Speaker 0: We got to close things up, right?

222
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:11,302
Speaker 0: It's like Like.

223
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:21,640
Speaker 1: if you want to know what's wrong with you why there used to be a lot of really good Android Twitter clients And now there aren't any it's because Twitter removed all the features from the API necessary to make a good Twitter app.

224
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:24,353
Speaker 0: It's like you just did work to develop those features.

225
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:25,539
Speaker 0: Why would you delete them?

226
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, now like no one's gonna pay you for that feature.

227
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:31,540
Speaker 1: now you think why is Twitter doing this?

228
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,760
Speaker 1: Like.

229
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:38,501
Speaker 1: why is Twitter making it so hard to use the very simple API that just lets you block an account Like?

230
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:49,160
Speaker 1: why so, uh, I found this article from 2015 Where Twitter had implemented massive block features that they didn't have before.

231
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:53,748
Speaker 1: They implemented this whole thing where you can Import and export block list.

232
00:14:53,769 --> 00:15:00,415
Speaker 1: so I could make a big block list of like all those big MiNONA fans and I could share it with all my friends and they could just import that block list.

233
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:04,973
Speaker 1: like Twitter started making Features that do the things that this block together thing did.

234
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:11,780
Speaker 1: so you might think okay I guess Twitter is trying to like run this themselves for some reason instead of letting someone else do all the work.

235
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:18,562
Speaker 1: Okay And they even shared this article talking about how sharing block lists will help you make Twitter safer Like.

236
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:26,488
Speaker 1: they highlighted it as a feature of Twitter to make Twitter a safer place, especially if people who get harassed Fast forward now to 2020.

237
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:33,375
Speaker 1: Twitter very recently like in the last couple months Removed the ability to import and export block lists.

238
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:41,920
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Twitter seems to have removed almost every safety feature that they implemented over the met last many years just in the last few months.

239
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:45,829
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't know why it seems insane.

240
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:56,267
Speaker 1: Twitter is even like they've throttled their API such that even that Chrome plug-in that you can click on some shitty Twitter account and Automatically block everyone who follows that account.

241
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:59,699
Speaker 1: They've throttled the API such that that thing doesn't work anymore either.

242
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:07,780
Speaker 1: Twitter is like aggressively going after features that make it easy for people to block Nazis and I don't know why.

243
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:11,420
Speaker 1: The only reason I bring this up on a Thursday is to make a more broad point.

244
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:16,300
Speaker 1: The problem with like harassment on the internet is not a technology problem.

245
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:21,094
Speaker 1: the tools to handle this are fairly trivial to make.

246
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:32,832
Speaker 1: the problem is that platforms actively prevent people from using these kinds of tools and Actively avoid just banning all the accounts that are the problem.

247
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:33,975
Speaker 1: like read it recently.

248
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,640
Speaker 1: They shut down all these awful subreddits.

249
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:39,640
Speaker 1: Why didn't they just ban literally every account that was in those subreddits?

250
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:40,719
Speaker 0: That's what I said.

251
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:47,060
Speaker 1: If the if the subreddit is bad enough to be banned then you should ban fucking everybody who used that thing ever.

252
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:50,553
Speaker 1: And sure, maybe there's a little bit of friendly fire.

253
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:51,637
Speaker 1: someone subscribe accident.

254
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:52,380
Speaker 1: I don't care.

255
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:59,080
Speaker 1: We already agreed as a society that blocking ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of all email is worth the trouble.

256
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:09,890
Speaker 1: like we all agree that we'd rather block every spam no matter what even if a Surprising percentage of valid emails get flagged to spam Why don't we just if you had a span ever had a G?

257
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:12,180
Speaker 0: if your Gmail spam filter, right?

258
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:20,627
Speaker 0: Never ever accidentally mark something as spam that wasn't spam, but occasionally a spam got through You would be upset.

259
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:22,680
Speaker 0: You'd be like what the fuck is a spam in my Gmail, right?

260
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,020
Speaker 0: So what Gmail does is it never lets us spit and there's never been a spam in my mailbox.

261
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:35,227
Speaker 0: Yep, right, but once in a blue moon a real email gets marked as spam Like once or twice like a quarter.

262
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,030
Speaker 1: that happens to me.

263
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:45,094
Speaker 0: and then people people it's like oh if they're expecting the email They check their spam filter and they find it and if they weren't Expecting the email then they don't miss it.

264
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:46,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, not a big deal.

265
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:48,229
Speaker 1: So these platforms like there are.

266
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:49,214
Speaker 0: someone asked me.

267
00:17:49,274 --> 00:18:01,012
Speaker 0: if someone asked me on Twitter let's say I'd make a tweet and a thousand people at me right and it blocks all the Nazis adding me and It blocks a few nice ads that I would have liked to see

268
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:05,909
Speaker 1: like a nice person who happens to have Accidentally followed a Nazi bot.

269
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,300
Speaker 0: Let's say it's like well, I'm not gonna miss that at right.

270
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,245
Speaker 1: Well, what I'm not gonna miss.

271
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:18,919
Speaker 0: someone who got caught in friendly fire because they accidentally follow a Bob Their message is not so important that the fact that it was blocked is like a big deal, right?

272
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:31,223
Speaker 0: but if instead, you know all the good replies get through and I see them all but Two Nazis get through and I see two Nazi ads it's like that's not good Right.

273
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:34,853
Speaker 0: It's like we want more blocking pretty much everywhere, right?

274
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:41,920
Speaker 0: You should lock everything bad Even if it means blocking a couple good things and that we've already determined that that's the correct model.

275
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,659
Speaker 0: It's just few platforms other than email implement that model.

276
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:48,950
Speaker 1: So, uh, yep.

277
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,640
Speaker 1: I that's all I got to say about that.

278
00:18:50,740 --> 00:19:01,880
Speaker 1: Like the problem is the people with power refuse to use their power Either because like I didn't I think there's a lot of reasons why some of them have like this false nobility.

279
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:13,183
Speaker 1: We're like they believe there's a higher purpose like some free speech thing but most of them it really just seems like they're in cahoots with shitty people or they're dependent upon shitty people and Like Twitter

280
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:17,059
Speaker 0: they care more about numbers and they believe that that will help their numbers.

281
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:17,842
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, like.

282
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:25,579
Speaker 1: I honestly think if Twitter actually blocked and banned all the bots and Nazis They'd lose like a third of the accounts on Twitter if not more.

283
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:39,687
Speaker 0: Well, if they if Twitter if you took all the number of Twitter accounts there are total right and you removed all the bad people and you removed all the inactive accounts and You removed all this the bot accounts.

284
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,717
Speaker 0: How many accounts would really be left?

285
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:43,580
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a lot of people.

286
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,300
Speaker 1: I think there's enough to have a thriving community and a great pleasure, but there's not enough to pay back those VCS.

287
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,240
Speaker 0: Is there enough to pay for all the employees of Twitter?

288
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,839
Speaker 0: It's like this huge company with a shit ton of employees, huh?

289
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,360
Speaker 1: Right, but how about this if you got rid of all those accounts and didn't and prevented them from rejoining?

290
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:10,359
Speaker 1: Maybe you need less infrastructure to stop just like how much infrastructure in Twitter is just passing Nazi bots retweeting each other at each other in a vacuum that no human ever sees.

291
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:14,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're uh, you know.

292
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:31,860
Speaker 0: if you're running just like a web server on the internet Right and you just put it out there and you don't have any sort of protections on it It's like you actually use a lot of CPUs and bandwidth just dealing with like random things on the internet Just like pinging your server and trying to connect your SSH or scraping your website and all this stuff.

293
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:45,158
Speaker 0: Right, if you just put a little filters on there and you block, you know some some naughty activities Right suddenly your web server is only doing the things you want it to do and you save a ton of money.

294
00:20:45,238 --> 00:20:49,960
Speaker 1: Yeah All right But anyway It's Thursday.

295
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:54,539
Speaker 1: Not a ton of news because we don't need to talk about the news that you should all be following on your own.

296
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:55,904
Speaker 1: Black lives matter.

297
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:58,492
Speaker 1: do you fund the police like all that stuff is happening?

298
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:04,240
Speaker 1: Don't get don't come to us To get updates on that because we're two white guys.

299
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,940
Speaker 1: There are way better people to go to and if you're not following.

300
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:11,020
Speaker 0: That's a problem is from the same place that we're getting it from black people on Twitter.

301
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,234
Speaker 1: Yep, if you wouldn't hear about that stuff unless we talk about it.

302
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:15,600
Speaker 1: That's a big problem.

303
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,616
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

304
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:23,100
Speaker 1: What do you got?

305
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:25,025
Speaker 0: What do I have?

306
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:25,829
Speaker 0: I forget?

307
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,252
Speaker 0: Let me check.

308
00:21:26,272 --> 00:21:27,820
Speaker 1: Let's get to the root of that problem.

309
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:30,851
Speaker 0: What was it the bootleg root?

310
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:34,707
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah So yeah bootleg.

311
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:45,740
Speaker 0: board games have been a problem for a while now partially because you know the the there are laws Regarding the intellectual property of board games are such that you can't control mechanics.

312
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:49,600
Speaker 1: Game mechanic is not really inherently copyrightable.

313
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:57,668
Speaker 1: So if I fully and if I design a game that is mechanically identical to a game that already exists I can sell that.

314
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,780
Speaker 1: they don't have any claim on those game mechanics.

315
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,420
Speaker 1: They can't say that they have a copyright on the way worker placement works in their game.

316
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:05,890
Speaker 0: You can only copyright copyright the artwork.

317
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:08,140
Speaker 0: You can copyright the text of your rule book.

318
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

319
00:22:09,143 --> 00:22:14,940
Speaker 0: so it's like I'd have to basically write the rules that are equivalently the same but not like copy their rule book.

320
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,439
Speaker 1: You have to do what a lot of high school kids do when they all plagiarize the same essay, right exactly but anyway.

321
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:35,179
Speaker 0: So, you know for what's been happening is there has been straight-up bootlegging which is where In places usually in China where board games are printed, right?

322
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,729
Speaker 0: Companies were printing out Direct copies of existing board games.

323
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:49,300
Speaker 0: like you would put in an order and say I want a thousand copies of my game and they would Make them and then some other factor would make a thousand copies of the game sometimes even the same factor.

324
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,060
Speaker 1: He just makes another thousand copies and sells them on the black market, right?

325
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,473
Speaker 0: But it's like it looks the same like exactly the same right.

326
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:58,160
Speaker 0: the same exact rules text, right?

327
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,540
Speaker 0: But like the quality would be lower right be shitty your cardboard right if the printing resolution be lower, right?

328
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,389
Speaker 0: But an untrained I would never be able to tell that right.

329
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,079
Speaker 0: only the only a nerd would know that was not an original You know copy of the game.

330
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:14,569
Speaker 0: And then they would flood the market with those.

331
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:17,360
Speaker 0: and like Amazon's you go like or anywhere else on the internet.

332
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:31,542
Speaker 0: so you go online and you're like I want to buy a copy of a carcass own and a carcass own shows up and It's a flimsy crappy carcass own that looks like a normal one And if you're not if you don't know better you just got hosed right cuz that money did not go to the correct company It should have.

333
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:35,435
Speaker 1: some people might like be like those anime fans who bought bootlegs on purpose because they were cheap.

334
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:36,499
Speaker 1: like that happens, too.

335
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:48,519
Speaker 0: But there's another level of bootlegging in the board game industry that goes on which is where The people are taking Chinese mostly as you can see in the examples in this at this link, right?

336
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,680
Speaker 0: The same exact game, but the same exact rules only translated into Chinese, right?

337
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,115
Speaker 0: So the game does not has not been licensed for the Chinese market.

338
00:23:58,176 --> 00:23:58,638
Speaker 0: I think it's.

339
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,017
Speaker 0: you know It doesn't look like it has been right.

340
00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:04,887
Speaker 0: And They redo the art they.

341
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:08,520
Speaker 0: they don't redo the rules or the mechanics it seems based on what it looks like.

342
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:17,500
Speaker 0: But they basically take the exact same game and reef redo all the art completely You know in their own style and translate it and then sell it in China.

343
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:21,519
Speaker 0: And it doesn't seem like they're paying licensing fees to the original creators.

344
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:24,966
Speaker 1: By the end Patrick leader even tweeted.

345
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:29,020
Speaker 1: He was like remember kids real copies of root have art lovingly made by Kyle Farron.

346
00:24:29,862 --> 00:24:31,506
Speaker 0: Right it's like you know.

347
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:37,000
Speaker 0: you look at the the art they made though and some of it is a pretty astonishingly great.

348
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:39,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of it is just astonishing.

349
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:52,197
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's like a hive game where they've replaced all the bugs with like some fantasy warriors of some kind and instead of clacky tiles They've used little tiny cardboard hexes.

350
00:24:53,306 --> 00:25:01,780
Speaker 0: That looks pretty bad, but yeah Here's a whole thread of that second variety of knockoff board game in which the games have been redone.

351
00:25:02,243 --> 00:25:02,807
Speaker 0: It's pretty.

352
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:04,379
Speaker 0: it's pretty terrific to behold.

353
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:07,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, this doesn't happen just with board games.

354
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,559
Speaker 0: that happens pretty much with anything yep.

355
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,614
Speaker 1: So there was a meme that made the rounds a while ago if you didn't see it.

356
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:15,440
Speaker 1: It's a. it was the potion seller.

357
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:20,967
Speaker 1: It's a. there is an adventurer and the adventure It's one person doing the voice acting of the two characters.

358
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:30,960
Speaker 1: the adventurer wants to buy some potions from the potion seller and the potion Seller is warning the traveler that his potions are too strong and that he will not sell them to him.

359
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:32,148
Speaker 1: And it's just like a skit.

360
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:39,220
Speaker 1: It's okay funny, however People started doing the thing where they were remixing this meme and that started to get a lot of control.

361
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:42,718
Speaker 1: And it ended with this supreme work of art.

362
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,655
Speaker 1: someone took the audio from the potion seller.

363
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:59,922
Speaker 1: they Animated it in the style of Jojo's bizarre adventure Added music to it and turned it into a mini episode of Jojo's where a Jojo character is trying to buy potions from another Jojo character.

364
00:25:59,942 --> 00:26:06,119
Speaker 1: it is too funny for this world and this entire dialogue is like burned into my soul at this point.

365
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:08,550
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't.

366
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:10,624
Speaker 0: if I have seen it I don't remember it.

367
00:26:10,764 --> 00:26:12,230
Speaker 1: the potion seller meme is not.

368
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:14,920
Speaker 1: it did not seem to appear in our circles.

369
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:26,780
Speaker 1: It came to me by way of a friend of ours who was in our circles But also many many very very different online circles and the intersection of a burning wheel game brought this to my attention.

370
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:29,527
Speaker 1: Okay in the meta moment.

371
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:30,432
Speaker 1: We're stuck at home.

372
00:26:30,452 --> 00:26:31,498
Speaker 1: There's a long weekend.

373
00:26:31,518 --> 00:26:31,820
Speaker 1: You're lucky.

374
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,272
Speaker 1: We're doing a show today usually right before a holiday weekend.

375
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:34,854
Speaker 1: We'll bail.

376
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:35,759
Speaker 0: I got off work at 3 today.

377
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,303
Speaker 0: I didn't.

378
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:45,265
Speaker 1: I would have gone off at work 3 But there was a. there was an outage and I'm I'm the kind of manager person like if you've ever worked in like big iron IT, you know.

379
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:48,060
Speaker 1: when there's a problem there's like different classes of people who get involved.

380
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,679
Speaker 1: Like there's the person who desperately is trying not to get invited to the conference call that has a million people on it.

381
00:26:54,242 --> 00:26:57,797
Speaker 1: There's the person actually fixing the problem that no one's actually talking to.

382
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:12,879
Speaker 1: for some reason There's all the salespeople who are on that conference call constantly asking for updates that no one gives them updates And then there's the person who eventually joins the conference call and as soon as they join everyone gets quiet and that Person asks for an update and then leaves.

383
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:20,380
Speaker 1: that last part is the role I usually serve in these conference calls, but That meant I had to keep doing a lot of work right up until we did the show.

384
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:27,835
Speaker 1: I couldn't I couldn't ease into the night for this long weekend Like I don't know if it's 459 right and my work says oh shit.

385
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:28,497
Speaker 0: Something's out.

386
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:29,119
Speaker 0: Can you help?

387
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:29,460
Speaker 0: I say?

388
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll give you exactly one minute of help.

389
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:43,240
Speaker 1: And then in the or in the case of today if at 259 I Work on I get paid enough to where I am willing to work a lot harder when that when the time comes.

390
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:47,660
Speaker 1: But if I but if that happened to all such there is no such time is there alright.

391
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,647
Speaker 1: So here's the question for you.

392
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,258
Speaker 1: Is there an amount of money?

393
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:58,868
Speaker 0: is There if they say if I said you have one more minute to and I'm gonna no longer work on this and they said we Will give you a million dollars.

394
00:27:58,928 --> 00:27:59,532
Speaker 0: I say, okay.

395
00:27:59,572 --> 00:28:00,780
Speaker 0: I'll work on this for another minute.

396
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:07,810
Speaker 1: So Yeah, check out our YouTube channels watch for our stuff.

397
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,900
Speaker 1: I'm working on things this weekend things you might be interested in.

398
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:23,296
Speaker 1: We're working on some panels for some online conventions working on a lot but Unfortunately, like we've worn before a lot of the projects we really want to work on are very hard to move forward when Scott And I cannot be in a room together.

399
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,659
Speaker 1: So we're making progress on things that do not require that.

400
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:30,712
Speaker 1: But the things that do not require that are much longer-term projects.

401
00:28:30,732 --> 00:28:39,140
Speaker 1: where there's not a lot we can show you and we're very hesitant To talk about them because that will imply that we have done more work than we have up to this point.

402
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:40,989
Speaker 0: I've done some stuff that no one would notice.

403
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:43,340
Speaker 0: I upgraded the hardware of some of our servers.

404
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:53,539
Speaker 1: Ooh, this thing still works that you don't even know that I did that I set up and did some tests with my teleprompter and a paid streaming rig to do some other kinds of content.

405
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:06,880
Speaker 1: Okay So, uh, yeah, otherwise we will eventually read the tale of Genji, but But right now I don't have a lot of free time that I am stuck in subways or trains or transit.

406
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:16,480
Speaker 0: Like I feel like when I mostly read is when I'm flying taking trains somewhere I can't even go to the beach and do summer eating like but I weren't even go to a pool and do some reading.

407
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:25,600
Speaker 1: Yeah like if we could go to Sandy Hook like what we do this weekend you and me and a bunch of our friends would be Sandy Hook and I would lay there for about four hours reading the tale of Genji.

408
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:31,796
Speaker 1: Like that's what I would be doing tomorrow, but I can't nope Yep, so that's where we are.

409
00:29:32,362 --> 00:29:33,108
Speaker 1: Wear masks.

410
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,584
Speaker 1: if you have to go outside Don't fly.

411
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:36,789
Speaker 1: if you can go outside.

412
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:39,178
Speaker 0: if you don't have to don't go anywhere if you don't have to.

413
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,264
Speaker 1: yeah I'm wrong.

414
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:43,400
Speaker 1: I'm going outside a lot, but I'm doing like long runs by myself.

415
00:29:44,024 --> 00:29:49,050
Speaker 0: It sucks big time to not go outside But you know It sucks worse being anywhere other than New York.

416
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,620
Speaker 0: right now in America often you're long out and dying.

417
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:57,778
Speaker 0: I'll just stay inside and be sad rather than die because I'll be way more sad if I get covered.

418
00:29:57,979 --> 00:30:09,834
Speaker 1: Yeah so One of the consequences of staying inside means that I subscribe to a lot more food boxes than I used to We were we subscribe to some of these things before.

419
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:18,283
Speaker 1: what we're talking about like the topic of the show is basically those things like Hello Fresh or Blue Apron or Misfits Market that are Variously.

420
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:28,620
Speaker 1: we will mail you like three or four meals with recipes on a weekly or monthly Basis or we will mail you groceries where you don't quite get to pick.

421
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,320
Speaker 1: We're not talking about just food delivery like fresh direct.

422
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,163
Speaker 1: We're not talking about.

423
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:41,320
Speaker 1: I can just put in an order for specific or fresh strike does have some meal delivery stuff They do but primarily I can pick exactly what I want for a specific delivery.

424
00:30:41,722 --> 00:30:44,580
Speaker 1: We're talking about the ones where you don't a hundred percent get to pick.

425
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,700
Speaker 1: They're like a subscription very similar to those boxes of here's some clothes.

426
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:52,000
Speaker 1: Try the ones you want mail back the ones you don't want to keep.

427
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,793
Speaker 0: Well, I mean we spent a lot of time in this show berating rightly So various subscription boxes like the loot crate.

428
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:01,384
Speaker 0: the thing with the loot crate Here's some garbage.

429
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:02,187
Speaker 0: right.

430
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:05,500
Speaker 0: loot crate is we'll send you a box of mystery shit.

431
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:07,933
Speaker 0: You don't even know what you're buying your plate.

432
00:31:07,973 --> 00:31:09,200
Speaker 1: I mean I solve the mystery.

433
00:31:09,321 --> 00:31:19,802
Speaker 1: This is the stuff we literally couldn't sell for any amount of money and we're just trying to get it away Mailing it to getting you to buy it from us is way better than just throwing it in our dumpster that we actually have to Pay for

434
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:21,851
Speaker 0: and we can also charge people on both ends.

435
00:31:21,891 --> 00:31:23,900
Speaker 0: They'll pay to put advertisements in our box.

436
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,637
Speaker 1: They're basically turning you into a dumpster that pays for garbage to be put into it.

437
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,316
Speaker 0: Yeah But the food boxes are a bit different right because a it's never a mystery.

438
00:31:35,336 --> 00:31:36,440
Speaker 0: What's in there, right?

439
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,851
Speaker 0: B they're not dumping like the leftover food.

440
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:44,043
Speaker 0: They couldn't sell right like sort of Unsuspectingly.

441
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:47,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, right is like you're just buying food.

442
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:49,526
Speaker 0: We're like different channels.

443
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:51,571
Speaker 1: is food that like couldn't be sold?

444
00:31:51,652 --> 00:31:53,517
Speaker 1: but that's what I signed up for.

445
00:31:53,617 --> 00:32:06,565
Speaker 0: Send me the ugly tomatoes yeah, and The other thing is you the way those sites every single one of them I've used and I've used a few is Set up in such a way where they let you know well in advance Exactly what you're getting.

446
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:11,163
Speaker 0: you have a even though you don't have a complete freedom of choice, you know There's limitations.

447
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:22,377
Speaker 0: you do make choices of what you're gonna get and if you don't like the choices or if you have Some reason that you don't want a box even though it's a subscription you can it comes with.

448
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,080
Speaker 0: are you all weekly?

449
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,540
Speaker 0: You can just pick to skip any week you want, right?

450
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,511
Speaker 0: You can just like, you know I'm gonna skip 20 weeks in a row or you can just cancel it in any time Like I've clicked the cancel button.

451
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:32,440
Speaker 0: It just works immediately.

452
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,367
Speaker 0: It's like okay canceled.

453
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:40,900
Speaker 0: if you log back into our site We'll turn it back on right and every single one of them is is basically the same in that regard.

454
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,464
Speaker 0: I've never seen one that does it differently.

455
00:32:42,605 --> 00:32:45,372
Speaker 0: Yep, so they're not fooling you.

456
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:48,200
Speaker 0: They're not tricking you into buying some garbage, right?

457
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:53,377
Speaker 0: They're just selling you food that you need regularly, which is something you need regularly.

458
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:53,899
Speaker 0: It's food.

459
00:32:55,442 --> 00:33:07,865
Speaker 0: And they solve some problems for people that the grocery store does not solve Especially people who live in cities have small apartments don't have giant pantries Right don't have cars.

460
00:33:08,126 --> 00:33:08,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

461
00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:12,220
Speaker 0: the or don't live with a lot of people with a big family, right?

462
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,740
Speaker 0: So the problems that they solve is the biggest one at least for me is food waste.

463
00:33:17,222 --> 00:33:20,996
Speaker 0: If I want to make a recipe and that recipe involves say Swiss chard, right?

464
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:22,020
Speaker 0: I go to the grocery store.

465
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,024
Speaker 0: They got Swiss chard there.

466
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:23,707
Speaker 0: It's pretty nice.

467
00:33:24,148 --> 00:33:26,016
Speaker 0: But there's a minimum amount you can buy.

468
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:27,040
Speaker 0: I can't buy like one leaf.

469
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:27,889
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

470
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:38,231
Speaker 0: I got to buy a bundle but then I get home and I'm making a recipe for one or two people and I use like two leafs and Unless I cook that same recipe several times which you know who wants to do that?

471
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:42,174
Speaker 0: or find like ten recipes that all use Swiss Chard and get sick of it, right?

472
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,482
Speaker 0: I just bought a whole bundle of chard even if the price was cheap and I'm gonna some of its gonna go bad and get Thrown out.

473
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:52,160
Speaker 0: there's like no avoiding it because I don't have a big family to eat a whole bundle, right?

474
00:33:52,881 --> 00:34:04,276
Speaker 0: So when you order from these boxes, it's like, okay We're gonna send you a meal all prepared with the exact ingredients for that meal And if that meal needs one leaf in the box is one leaf.

475
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:09,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it Right, no food waste which is if it feels really good to not have food waste.

476
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,139
Speaker 0: The second thing they solve for you is meal planning which is like work, right?

477
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,010
Speaker 0: It's like let's say I was gonna go to the grocery and cook.

478
00:34:17,492 --> 00:34:18,900
Speaker 0: I got to figure out what I'm gonna cook.

479
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:20,280
Speaker 0: I got to spend time planning.

480
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:27,272
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, there's two ways to go there either I have to plan and to go through this hassle like you're talking about which You know, I'm busy like I even during the quarantine.

481
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:28,560
Speaker 1: I don't have a lot of free time actually.

482
00:34:29,353 --> 00:34:37,320
Speaker 0: But yeah It's like if we're talking about old shitty pre feminist society where there's like a person who stays home and that is their job.

483
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, then you can accomplish that.

484
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:44,438
Speaker 0: But if you're talking about a modern, you know egalitarian not shitty society, right?

485
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,328
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it's shitty that everyone has to work right?

486
00:34:47,388 --> 00:34:50,319
Speaker 1: But yeah, but that's that's a different problem to solve, right?

487
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,600
Speaker 0: Regardless the point is nobody's at your house Spending all day meal planning as their job, right?

488
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:04,434
Speaker 0: So everyone's going to work or school or doing something productive that they want to do And no one wants to do the work of staying alive.

489
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:07,468
Speaker 0: So You pay them to do it for you.

490
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:09,077
Speaker 0: They think they say hey, here's some meals.

491
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:11,920
Speaker 0: We've planned them We provide you with the recipe and the exact ingredients.

492
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:16,740
Speaker 0: You don't have to go to the grocery store and figure out what to get or anything like that.

493
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:28,380
Speaker 1: Now being a better cook means you can buy groceries with less planning and still make good meals But one a lot of people like honestly do not have the time in their lives to learn to be a good cook.

494
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:29,083
Speaker 1: Like.

495
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:33,325
Speaker 1: that's a thing like we can't pretend that everyone has the time to become good cooks Like we have.

496
00:35:33,345 --> 00:36:02,440
Speaker 1: I think I'm a pretty good cook at this point, but to If I do that and I know because I've seen this happen in my life like when we lived in Beacon or like during time periods in our lives when we were busy like really busy here like a Lot of cons if I don't plan meals and I do grocery shopping I can make a whole bunch of meals But I tend to default to a pretty narrow set of the kinds of meals that I am very comfortable making That I know intuitively that I don't need recipes for from a limited set of ingredients.

497
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:04,388
Speaker 1: So I don't tend to expand my horizons.

498
00:36:04,669 --> 00:36:07,400
Speaker 1: I tend to make a lot of pastas and chilies and things like that.

499
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:09,567
Speaker 1: I don't tend to make something new.

500
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:10,852
Speaker 1: I don't try a new recipe.

501
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:12,498
Speaker 1: I just make something that I know is easy to make.

502
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:21,510
Speaker 1: So but what that leads to is that pre-covid because once the quarantine happened I have a lot of additional reasons that I'm using these food boxes.

503
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:44,800
Speaker 1: We're subscribed to way more now than we ever were but Blue apron was the one that I did first and what I found was that it almost served like a Cooking class in that as these recipes came in that like there'd be a lot of certain techniques that I would learn like how to cook a certain kind of spice a certain way Or like how to deal with a certain kind of vegetable that isn't like within your normal comfort zone.

504
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:52,760
Speaker 0: Every time that vegetable would show up in a box you deal with it pretty much the same way usually Yeah, and it's like oh well now I know how to cook that vegetable.

505
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:54,800
Speaker 1: Like I know how to make a Beckmell sauce.

506
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,412
Speaker 1: I don't need to like look up a recipe for that.

507
00:36:57,814 --> 00:37:02,094
Speaker 1: or if I'm making a Complicated recipe that involves it kind of like we talk about with board games.

508
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:08,035
Speaker 1: if you learn how to play Yahtzee And you learn how to play Dominion learn how to play all these like sub games that are really complicated.

509
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:12,380
Speaker 1: game becomes much simpler These by following these recipes over time.

510
00:37:12,942 --> 00:37:17,100
Speaker 1: It forced me to become a much better cook and I know how to cook a lot of things without looking at recipes.

511
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:24,562
Speaker 1: So I can look at a really complicated recipe now and I can just glaze over all the easy stuff like okay Make a sauce.

512
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:29,640
Speaker 1: Okay deal with it that and only focus on the unique part of the recipe or the construction of the final meal.

513
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,720
Speaker 1: Mmm, and that was anyway.

514
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the boxes are pretty good for all those reasons.

515
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,080
Speaker 0: the ways that they are bad is that they are expensive, right?

516
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,484
Speaker 0: You're losing money versus.

517
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:46,685
Speaker 1: yeah, this is way more expensive than buying all these things in a grocery store With the caveat that.

518
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:51,844
Speaker 1: the caveat though is if you buy all these things in a grocery store You're gonna throw a lot of it away.

519
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:54,372
Speaker 0: Anyway, right you would be going to.

520
00:37:54,392 --> 00:38:00,300
Speaker 0: most of them are about $20 for a meal that feeds two people with two servings.

521
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,660
Speaker 0: So it's about ten dollars a serving for pretty much all the boxes from all the different companies.

522
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,460
Speaker 0: There's some differences in there, but it's generally ten dollars a serving.

523
00:38:09,742 --> 00:38:10,970
Speaker 0: So that's like sort of.

524
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:12,197
Speaker 0: it's not quite go.

525
00:38:12,237 --> 00:38:12,660
Speaker 0: It depends.

526
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,920
Speaker 1: It's a better deal for people like us who live in the city where groceries are just a lot more expensive.

527
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:18,967
Speaker 0: Right, it's like for me to go out to read it.

528
00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:19,730
Speaker 0: go out and eat.

529
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:21,255
Speaker 0: right would be.

530
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:26,960
Speaker 0: I'd only be able to beat $10 a serving going out to a restaurant if I got some real shitty fast food.

531
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:29,596
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the diner is still a little more than $10 a person.

532
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:34,520
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but like any food that I would go out to eat that's not fast food.

533
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:42,227
Speaker 0: It's like not McDonald's not just some fried chicken or something from the greasies place palace fried chicken Anything that's not.

534
00:38:42,268 --> 00:38:43,960
Speaker 0: that is gonna cost me more than ten bucks.

535
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,900
Speaker 0: So I'm still saving money versus eating out because I'm in the city.

536
00:38:47,301 --> 00:38:54,047
Speaker 0: But if I didn't live in the city while then eating out for less than ten bucks is a lot easier Yeah, but also just the grocery stores.

537
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:57,540
Speaker 1: like meat is more expensive here than it is upstate.

538
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:59,246
Speaker 1: But yeah, I live in a suburb.

539
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:01,957
Speaker 0: if you live in a suburb the grocery store is cheaper.

540
00:39:01,997 --> 00:39:08,341
Speaker 0: even so like yogurt It's like for me to get a single little yogurt cup is like one to two dollars in the suburbs It's.

541
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:11,791
Speaker 0: it'll be like, you know five yogurt cups for like 250.

542
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,676
Speaker 0: It's like it's so cheap.

543
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:15,060
Speaker 0: It's like holy shit.

544
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,430
Speaker 0: They're less than a dollar each right?

545
00:39:16,491 --> 00:39:17,337
Speaker 0: It's such a deal.

546
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:23,520
Speaker 0: So the the food boxes are the same price no matter where you live so you can save money.

547
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:35,567
Speaker 1: Possibly or you know, it makes more economic sense based on your geography Yeah, and also based on your living circumstances because like Scott pointed out Cooking for one is a real.

548
00:39:35,628 --> 00:39:44,240
Speaker 1: it's kind of like a one-bedroom apartment or a studio like a one-bedroom apartment versus two-bedroom Cooking for one versus cooking for literally any number of people other than one.

549
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:49,634
Speaker 1: It's like a whole different kind of cooking and the I think it's like one to more than two.

550
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:56,072
Speaker 1: true because cooking for one Very rarely when I live by myself would I ever make a side dish?

551
00:39:56,914 --> 00:39:59,682
Speaker 1: I would basically just cook one thing Right.

552
00:39:59,702 --> 00:40:07,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like most of these sort of for example, right when sometimes you get the food boxes There'll be a meal and most of the meals are two servings.

553
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:12,239
Speaker 0: So if you're only one person you're gonna make the two servings put one in the fridge and eat it later.

554
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:15,132
Speaker 0: Yep, right If you're two people, well, you can just eat it.

555
00:40:15,172 --> 00:40:16,400
Speaker 0: All right, then it's just dinner.

556
00:40:17,026 --> 00:40:20,228
Speaker 0: If you're more than two people well You know now you got but then you get the bigger.

557
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:21,895
Speaker 1: like some of these food services have things like.

558
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,067
Speaker 1: they have options that really Are tuned to people's lifestyles like we have we.

559
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:33,760
Speaker 1: there's one I saw that did a thing like you can choose a family Meal that serves three to five and has like bigger quantities and portions and more side dishes.

560
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,980
Speaker 0: For example, let's say one of the meals is just like some pasta.

561
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,640
Speaker 0: It's like well, that's real easy to eat one and put the other one in the fridge, right?

562
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:47,440
Speaker 0: But some of them are like, oh, it's a it's a it's a steak with a side salad and some vegetable.

563
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:57,874
Speaker 0: It's like well if that's a two sir If it's two servings of steak and a salad and a vegetables like I need the second person to be here I can't really put that in the fridge.

564
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:06,304
Speaker 0: Yep, right like I'm gonna make a salad and then eat half of it and put a half a salad in the fridge and it's like It's not great, right?

565
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:09,597
Speaker 0: You really need the two people to be there to choose that as a meal.

566
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,359
Speaker 0: Yeah box.

567
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:20,277
Speaker 0: so if the meals choices from that You know particular company are a lot like that then it's hard to do those as a single person.

568
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:20,798
Speaker 0: you need.

569
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:26,820
Speaker 1: you need a second Yep, but to get back to a positive one thing I noticed when I was making these a lot Is that if I try to cook elaborate meals?

570
00:41:27,282 --> 00:41:44,820
Speaker 1: I tend to have to juggle a lot of things in the kitchen at the same time Like if we do a big Thanksgiving dinner like friendsgiving or something Any big meal I'm juggling a lot or if I attempt something different or new even if it's just the two of us I may end up using like three burners at the same time or something.

571
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:53,720
Speaker 1: Most of these services the recipes are very much designed to need either Just one pan just one pot or one pot and one pan.

572
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,540
Speaker 1: Like they're designed to where no part of the recipe will interfere with any other part of the recipe.

573
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:06,567
Speaker 1: Whereas someone who's not a great cook like me a long time ago if you just try to pick like oh Here's a recipe for some pasta.

574
00:42:06,808 --> 00:42:08,840
Speaker 1: Here's a recipe for like some meat.

575
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:10,506
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make these two recipes.

576
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:14,420
Speaker 1: those two recipes might both need your oven with different temperatures at the same time.

577
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:17,629
Speaker 1: They might both need a pan and you only own one good pan.

578
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,080
Speaker 1: like you run into these race conditions that these meals hits avoid.

579
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, so let's talk about the different services.

580
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,144
Speaker 0: Yeah that we've tried right.

581
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:29,378
Speaker 0: so the first one I did was blue apron because that was like sort of the first one maybe.

582
00:42:29,398 --> 00:42:31,869
Speaker 1: yeah We both tried that one early on.

583
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:34,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, I used it for like the longest of all of them.

584
00:42:35,201 --> 00:42:40,536
Speaker 0: The things I liked about it were that you actually did quite a bit of like cooking, right?

585
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:41,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, they would usually.

586
00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:46,640
Speaker 0: Sometimes it was nice that they would like make you cook, but sometimes it was annoying.

587
00:42:46,762 --> 00:42:47,026
Speaker 0: It's like.

588
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:49,864
Speaker 0: it's like oh great Fucking Beckmell sauce.

589
00:42:49,904 --> 00:42:54,300
Speaker 1: like there's a period where it was nothing but either lemon zest or Beckmell, right?

590
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,682
Speaker 0: It's like it.

591
00:42:54,722 --> 00:42:56,938
Speaker 0: They'd send you a lemon and make you zest it and like alright.

592
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:57,260
Speaker 0: That's good.

593
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,673
Speaker 0: I get some nice fresh lemon zest instead of some lemon zest in a package.

594
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:03,343
Speaker 0: right yeah, but then they'd be like okay Here's some time.

595
00:43:03,403 --> 00:43:04,627
Speaker 0: pick all the leaves off the time.

596
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:06,474
Speaker 0: It's like I don't want to do that.

597
00:43:06,514 --> 00:43:08,140
Speaker 0: couldn't you have sent it pre-picked, right?

598
00:43:09,022 --> 00:43:11,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it blue apron makes you work a little harder.

599
00:43:12,883 --> 00:43:14,559
Speaker 0: It also you know the blue aprons.

600
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:18,330
Speaker 0: When I was alone they were sort of coming in.

601
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:22,060
Speaker 0: I get they sort of changed because I mean originally when I did it.

602
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,919
Speaker 1: Well, they've changed a few times, and they changed in a big way when the quarantine started.

603
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:33,380
Speaker 0: Originally they forced me to do three meals minimum and as a single person doing three making three a week.

604
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:34,665
Speaker 0: It was like this pressure.

605
00:43:35,106 --> 00:43:37,817
Speaker 0: It's like another box is coming with three more meals.

606
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:38,520
Speaker 0: cook cook cook.

607
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:41,140
Speaker 0: It's like oh guys like I didn't want to cook three times a week.

608
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:43,909
Speaker 0: Sometimes I did but sometimes I only want to do two.

609
00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:46,779
Speaker 1: sometimes we finish the show and then you'd go home like we've.

610
00:43:46,899 --> 00:43:48,266
Speaker 1: Emily I'll be like we're gonna eat out tonight.

611
00:43:48,307 --> 00:43:50,780
Speaker 1: You'd be like I got like a bunch of blue aprons.

612
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,303
Speaker 1: I got a deal.

613
00:43:51,323 --> 00:43:53,555
Speaker 0: I have to cook them because another box is coming.

614
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:54,360
Speaker 0: the pressure is on.

615
00:43:54,642 --> 00:43:57,098
Speaker 0: I don't want to skip the next one that I won't have food next week, right?

616
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,418
Speaker 0: But then they changed it to let me do two boxes of food And that was way better because the pressure was like eased off.

617
00:44:04,802 --> 00:44:06,295
Speaker 0: But yeah blue apron is nice.

618
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:09,637
Speaker 1: in that way It looks like they have an option now like you can pick an option of.

619
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:14,715
Speaker 1: hey I have a pressure cooker and they give you recipes tuned to the fact that you have one.

620
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:21,155
Speaker 0: of course all of the services Always let you choose your allergies or your tastes like yeah, send me fish.

621
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:22,740
Speaker 0: Don't send me any meat at all.

622
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,085
Speaker 0: Don't send me wheat.

623
00:44:24,345 --> 00:44:26,372
Speaker 0: You know you're totally good.

624
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:27,597
Speaker 0: Don't send me dairy all that stuff.

625
00:44:27,617 --> 00:44:28,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're all pretty good about that.

626
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:44,637
Speaker 1: The thing the thing I liked, but then stopped liking about blue apron early and when we canceled it We started up again, but we can't live for a long time was that after I'd used it for a long time I started seeing a lot of repeats of the recipes, and I wasn't learning anything new.

627
00:44:44,657 --> 00:44:46,448
Speaker 0: yeah They have a certain.

628
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:51,492
Speaker 0: once you've cooked blue apron recipes You should know how blue apron recipes go and then you can make.

629
00:44:51,632 --> 00:44:53,759
Speaker 0: you can like if you get another blue apron recipe like.

630
00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:56,870
Speaker 0: yeah I've seen this technique, but yeah, I know what's about that nowadays.

631
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:59,880
Speaker 1: I make a lot of blue apron recipes without blue apron.

632
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:02,042
Speaker 1: I just I don't even look at the old recipe card They gave me.

633
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:05,160
Speaker 1: I'm just like I'm gonna make that lemon zest pasta gnocchi.

634
00:45:05,321 --> 00:45:08,540
Speaker 1: I can make a lemon zest pasta gnocchi right the fuck now and just make it.

635
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

636
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:09,790
Speaker 0: I know what you're gonna.

637
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:17,820
Speaker 0: Do you're gonna make me Tell me to make a fucking pecmel sauce right every time the pecmel sauce because there was a period we're like isn't it bechamel?

638
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,531
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

639
00:45:20,425 --> 00:45:24,011
Speaker 1: Anyway That was a thing so we were always made fun of it.

640
00:45:24,052 --> 00:45:25,560
Speaker 1: like who the lemon zest arrived?

641
00:45:26,063 --> 00:45:28,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, blue aprons added a new a new thing.

642
00:45:28,301 --> 00:45:34,360
Speaker 0: I've recently turned it back on and they have our meal prep option which we just turned that on - I haven't gotten it yet.

643
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:46,315
Speaker 0: But it seems like what they're gonna Do is send me enough food to make eight servings of food that I can all put away in The fridge and save and then eat over the week after like a single big cooking session.

644
00:45:46,335 --> 00:45:47,660
Speaker 1: from what I can tell we tried it.

645
00:45:47,782 --> 00:45:48,299
Speaker 1: It's great.

646
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:59,678
Speaker 0: They basically looks like what they do is you make a bunch of different things and then you you mix them into different Combinations to get different meals even though you've only cooked like maybe five or six different items.

647
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:00,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

648
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,240
Speaker 0: So it's like okay you made this pasta and you made this side.

649
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:07,560
Speaker 0: Well in and you've made this meat and you've made this other side.

650
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:12,866
Speaker 0: We'll go pasta side one pasta side two meat side one meat side two And now you've got four different.

651
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:16,217
Speaker 1: now part of that seems to be with kovat and the quarantine one.

652
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,772
Speaker 1: There were huge supply chain disruptions for a while.

653
00:46:19,832 --> 00:46:21,620
Speaker 1: Like it was dicey getting certain kinds of food.

654
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,060
Speaker 1: It's sort of normalized now, but that was the thing.

655
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:36,920
Speaker 1: there was like a month where like I couldn't even get fresh direct deliveries like it was hard to get food and a lot of these services Actually stopped because they couldn't get their supplies either or they were running out of certain things.

656
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,459
Speaker 1: So I remember Blue Apron changed their recipes to simplify them a little bit.

657
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:47,531
Speaker 1: They started to like limit the number of like available recipes They'd even have and they started to like.

658
00:46:47,652 --> 00:46:53,416
Speaker 1: I think that's part of why they moved to this system Because that's the kind of thing if you have a family in particular you're stuck inside.

659
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,460
Speaker 1: you got to cook almost every day.

660
00:46:54,561 --> 00:47:04,780
Speaker 0: Anyway, right Well one thing that's something I did notice about Blue Apron is they would always tend to include at least one Tricky ingredient in all their recipes but never two at the same time.

661
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,869
Speaker 0: It was you never had two things to fuck with.

662
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:09,440
Speaker 0: it almost felt like a DRM kind of thing.

663
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:17,880
Speaker 0: I was like, hey if you try to go to the grocery to make this recipe you're gonna have to get like two tablespoons of cream of tartar.

664
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:20,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have cream.

665
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,229
Speaker 1: I mean I have cream of tartar too and a lot of people don't like.

666
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,860
Speaker 0: they'd be like yeah two tablespoons of verjuice little do.

667
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,163
Speaker 0: They know.

668
00:47:25,203 --> 00:47:27,985
Speaker 0: I am overloaded with the very else But it's like.

669
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:28,709
Speaker 0: it's like.

670
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:31,220
Speaker 0: yeah, you're not gonna find that in grocery stores, right?

671
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,480
Speaker 0: So or at least not, you know, I mean it's easier for us.

672
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,860
Speaker 1: But like one of them came with ghee and that was really exciting.

673
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:38,111
Speaker 1: I know a lot of people do not have easy access to ghee.

674
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:41,979
Speaker 0: He is just clarified butter pretty much Yeah, but it's like, you know, you can make it too.

675
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:56,183
Speaker 0: But the point is is that yeah a lot of people in like suburban type Non-city places who don't have or don't have a giant grocery store with like an international aisle are gonna be missing an ingredient And if they don't know that they can substitute that ingredient or whatever It's like.

676
00:47:56,224 --> 00:47:59,820
Speaker 0: yeah blue apron is sending you a tiny amount exactly the amount you need.

677
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:05,530
Speaker 0: You can't use that recipe on your own and you're gonna need to get it from blue apron again Because that ingredients hard for you to get.

678
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,495
Speaker 0: maybe you'll buy it online.

679
00:48:06,555 --> 00:48:06,837
Speaker 0: I don't know.

680
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:19,893
Speaker 1: so what I think blue apron did one we're tried that we're still doing now - is a Vegan recipes and they're honestly they are fantastic recipes.

681
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:20,956
Speaker 1: I okay.

682
00:48:20,996 --> 00:48:22,300
Speaker 1: We've made some really good food.

683
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:51,619
Speaker 1: I'm gonna admit something though We got it not so much because we're trying to go vegan but because that's a really easy way to have to learn cooking skills that don't involve meat because one thing I've learned about cooking is I've cooked more and more is that a Meat can well well prepared meat can cover a lot of cooking mistakes in the other Aspects of a meal in a way that when you're cooking like a purely vegan recipe You really can't fuck anything up or it'll taste weird and it forces you to get better.

684
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,360
Speaker 1: But - it was a just an easy way to cut down our meat consumption.

685
00:48:56,181 --> 00:49:01,324
Speaker 1: Like yeah, if we got some blue aprons like a two blue aprons and two purple carrots coming every week Guess what?

686
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:01,967
Speaker 1: We're gonna cook it.

687
00:49:01,988 --> 00:49:03,858
Speaker 1: We're gonna eat half as much meat as we normally do.

688
00:49:04,802 --> 00:49:05,023
Speaker 0: Yep.

689
00:49:05,063 --> 00:49:05,224
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:05,426
Speaker 0: Yep.

691
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:07,520
Speaker 0: So that's that's all you guys have our full carrot.

692
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:07,882
Speaker 1: Oh, it's.

693
00:49:07,982 --> 00:49:08,725
Speaker 1: I mean, it's really good.

694
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:22,429
Speaker 1: But the one thing I will admit is that as I've been cooking those recipes increasingly I Will substitute the vegan butter the vegan mayonnaise all the like the vegan cheese For real cheese and real butter.

695
00:49:22,529 --> 00:49:24,740
Speaker 0: because so what do you do with all the cheese and butter?

696
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,500
Speaker 1: They send you because that stuff tends to last forever.

697
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:34,824
Speaker 1: We keep it in the fridge usually and we'll use it in another recipe later or keep it as like an emergency supply Like here's the man.

698
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:36,209
Speaker 1: Here's some margarine.

699
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:39,219
Speaker 1: That'll never go bad, but I'm not gonna use it unless I'm forced to.

700
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:47,880
Speaker 1: Okay, but so the problem is the recipes taste a Thousand times better if you just substitute butter in for that vegan margarine.

701
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,250
Speaker 0: Like yeah, well, you're still not eating the meat.

702
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,800
Speaker 1: is the exactly like I made some vegan?

703
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,242
Speaker 0: It's not like.

704
00:49:52,262 --> 00:49:54,957
Speaker 0: you know, all the other services do have vegetarian options.

705
00:49:54,998 --> 00:49:55,842
Speaker 0: vegan up They all do.

706
00:49:56,183 --> 00:49:59,255
Speaker 1: but like purple carrot is like particularly good.

707
00:49:59,336 --> 00:50:00,460
Speaker 1: like the recipes are great.

708
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:08,151
Speaker 1: Like I made some vegan burgers the other day where I made the patties myself like shred some beets cook some rice Mush it all together in a blender.

709
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,580
Speaker 1: They were really good.

710
00:50:10,101 --> 00:50:19,739
Speaker 1: but what they did not warn me about was that all the ways to make vegan burger patties are Extremely difficult to deal with in the kitchen and make a gigantic mess.

711
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:23,436
Speaker 0: Okay Another one we tried was home chef.

712
00:50:23,879 --> 00:50:26,052
Speaker 0: Oh We tried home chef.

713
00:50:26,072 --> 00:50:36,764
Speaker 0: we did it for quite a while after I Basically right after PAX East we signed up for it and then I cancelled it just like so like right as the quarantine was happening Right.

714
00:50:36,845 --> 00:50:37,570
Speaker 0: It's like I didn't even.

715
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:39,060
Speaker 0: it wasn't even because of the quarantine.

716
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,974
Speaker 0: It was like hey after PAX East we're gonna be home and not have a schedule.

717
00:50:41,994 --> 00:50:43,200
Speaker 0: Let's go get food boxes again.

718
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:43,522
Speaker 0: All right.

719
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:44,226
Speaker 0: We'll try this one.

720
00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:45,051
Speaker 0: We'll see how it goes.

721
00:50:45,514 --> 00:50:46,500
Speaker 0: Oh, let's hold on to this.

722
00:50:47,702 --> 00:50:49,775
Speaker 0: We signed up with a good timing home.

723
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:54,373
Speaker 0: Chef was Kind of like a little more sad than boo aprons.

724
00:50:54,413 --> 00:51:00,176
Speaker 0: Some of the meals did taste really good But you were cooking a lot less for example one time.

725
00:51:00,236 --> 00:51:03,694
Speaker 1: I tried a bunch of servers I don't remember the names where that's exactly what I was about to say.

726
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:04,880
Speaker 1: So we're you're heading me off here.

727
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:14,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of the ones they would send would be like oven ready And it was basically a tray with food in it and you would do some stuff and just put it in the oven take it Out and eat it, right?

728
00:51:14,343 --> 00:51:18,115
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, that feels like TV dinner one time.

729
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,319
Speaker 0: They sent me one.

730
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:27,500
Speaker 0: I was this is the one I was most upset about is the one where they sent rice and Rather than blue apron they send you rice in a bag and they say make rice and I just put it my rice cooker.

731
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:30,391
Speaker 0: Yep, they sent this pre-cooked rice.

732
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,977
Speaker 1: That was like parboiled rice.

733
00:51:31,997 --> 00:51:40,635
Speaker 0: you yeah It's like it was just like put it in a bowl with some water and microwave it and I was like, uh, I Just I didn't even make that.

734
00:51:40,675 --> 00:51:41,239
Speaker 0: I just made rice.

735
00:51:42,828 --> 00:51:42,950
Speaker 0: Like.

736
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:43,479
Speaker 0: that's awful.

737
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:44,560
Speaker 1: I feel like you know what?

738
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:52,760
Speaker 1: I've noticed some of these are Clearly aimed at people who live in like urban environments and some of these are definitely aimed at the suburbs.

739
00:51:53,462 --> 00:51:59,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, the food was a little more bland didn't have those exciting ingredients that blue apron would send it that you couldn't get yourself.

740
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:08,979
Speaker 0: Sometimes the ingredient quality was a little low like they would send me a sad scallion and I would use my own scallion Right and throw their scallion away.

741
00:52:09,803 --> 00:52:12,945
Speaker 0: but some of the resumes in there were pretty good and what you would do?

742
00:52:12,985 --> 00:52:26,600
Speaker 0: there were a lot more choices than blue apron during the meal choosing part and What we just had to do is make sure that when we were choosing meals We didn't choose the ones that said like oven ready, right or didn't choose the ones that came with sad rice.

743
00:52:27,403 --> 00:52:33,745
Speaker 0: We could avoid those and we could choose the ones that made us cook and we could choose the ones that you know Looked more flavorful.

744
00:52:33,765 --> 00:52:34,247
Speaker 0: Mmm.

745
00:52:34,288 --> 00:52:35,976
Speaker 0: Oh, wait, they're ones that they had.

746
00:52:35,996 --> 00:52:36,780
Speaker 0: that were flatbreads.

747
00:52:38,262 --> 00:52:40,960
Speaker 0: Obviously the problem with those is that you need two people there to eat them.

748
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:46,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, we I'm a big fan of the flatbread ones I've gotten because there's two of us the home chef.

749
00:52:46,149 --> 00:52:48,076
Speaker 0: flatbreads were all like way good ones.

750
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:49,340
Speaker 0: I was into those.

751
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,367
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you cuz blue apron.

752
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:55,962
Speaker 0: I was like in flatbreads, but no the home chef flatbread ones were were quite good Like.

753
00:52:56,002 --> 00:52:57,507
Speaker 0: I would just make those again like buy some.

754
00:52:57,868 --> 00:53:03,429
Speaker 1: so all the other things we tried were have basically I have the same complaints Almost word-for-word that you just said.

755
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,840
Speaker 1: so assume a lot of the low-tier ones.

756
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,764
Speaker 1: It was kind of like that.

757
00:53:07,165 --> 00:53:11,001
Speaker 1: one thing I noticed though across all of them even the blue apron and then I like the nice ones.

758
00:53:12,026 --> 00:53:16,464
Speaker 1: I have not seen any of them have anything spicy and The like.

759
00:53:16,504 --> 00:53:17,649
Speaker 1: it's the point of them all.

760
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:26,720
Speaker 0: blue apron always says like add as much of the red pepper As much of the hot sauce as you want and I would always add all of it and it was never a problem.

761
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:32,543
Speaker 1: I got I one time like they were like add as much of the red pepper as you want, but be careful It'll make it spicy.

762
00:53:32,804 --> 00:53:36,778
Speaker 1: and they gave me this packet that had like 11 flakes of red pepper in it.

763
00:53:37,401 --> 00:53:40,675
Speaker 0: yep, like it mattered but it wasn't spicy.

764
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:48,240
Speaker 1: but like Is it just that the kinds of people who buy these food boxes are so white that they can't handle like any amount of spice?

765
00:53:48,581 --> 00:53:53,160
Speaker 1: Is this like pretty sure one of the Midwest pulling the one red pepper flake out with a tweezer?

766
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:59,180
Speaker 0: I'm confident that the customer base for these food boxes is almost entirely white.

767
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:03,612
Speaker 0: Yeah, because non white people don't need someone to tell them how to cook.

768
00:54:03,672 --> 00:54:06,600
Speaker 0: they have, you know a culture of cooking, right?

769
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:13,300
Speaker 1: These are definitely aimed at a yuppie like urban demographic or like a particular kind of suburban demographic.

770
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,680
Speaker 0: And even though you know, I may be white but I'm a Jew and I have a culture of cooking in my family.

771
00:54:18,141 --> 00:54:24,560
Speaker 0: Right the Jewish food that we cook, you know, the Jew meals of my family are meals for holidays and things, right?

772
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,700
Speaker 0: We don't have you know, the Jewish food to cook for every day, right?

773
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:32,660
Speaker 0: You know, it's it's like oh, there's a holiday All right.

774
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,474
Speaker 0: now the Jewish food comes out the chicken soups into the cookals and the breads.

775
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:37,719
Speaker 0: and but it's definitely like.

776
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:43,280
Speaker 1: a Common theme in all those food boxes is they will include spicy ingredients with a lot of warnings.

777
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:50,589
Speaker 1: But those spicy ingredients are not spicy like it was a we're talking less than the fire Salsa from a Taco Bell.

778
00:54:50,951 --> 00:54:58,337
Speaker 0: It was either a home chef or a Sun basket Which is one that we've done recently that had a jalapeno in it the other one whole jalapeno.

779
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:00,947
Speaker 1: Lord Someone's gonna die.

780
00:55:01,188 --> 00:55:01,711
Speaker 0: It's a hold on.

781
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:06,780
Speaker 0: so I cut up the hollow, you know It had all these warnings like, you know, clean your cutting board after you cut up the jalapeno.

782
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:13,015
Speaker 1: Oh When I clean board after I cut up like a habanero maybe so.

783
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:15,143
Speaker 0: so I Ignored that.

784
00:55:15,304 --> 00:55:19,680
Speaker 0: I just cut the jalapeno and put it right and it was something really funny happened.

785
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:22,549
Speaker 0: Is that somehow the food wasn't spicy?

786
00:55:22,629 --> 00:55:23,613
Speaker 0: obviously, right?

787
00:55:23,873 --> 00:55:25,198
Speaker 0: The jalapeno wasn't spicy.

788
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:33,758
Speaker 0: Yeah somehow Like the capsaicin from the jalapeno must have getting concentrated somewhere Even though I wash my hands.

789
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:38,579
Speaker 0: It must have gotten like I think was under my fingernail or something and then I poked myself in the eye.

790
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:39,684
Speaker 1: somehow I've done that.

791
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:40,327
Speaker 1: I've done that.

792
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:43,320
Speaker 1: you know what gets me when I clean the seeds out of a pepper.

793
00:55:43,421 --> 00:55:46,000
Speaker 1: Sometimes I'll just use my thumb like I'll pull it to pull them out with my thumb.

794
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,062
Speaker 0: It must have been something like that I've learned.

795
00:55:48,102 --> 00:55:52,057
Speaker 1: I forced myself to do it with the spoon no matter what even though I want to do it with.

796
00:55:52,078 --> 00:55:54,031
Speaker 0: the point is It wasn't spicy at all.

797
00:55:54,193 --> 00:55:55,020
Speaker 0: Nothing was spicy.

798
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:00,600
Speaker 0: The only spice problem was me poking myself with spice in the eye, but see this is what we're talking about.

799
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:06,797
Speaker 1: They warn you to clean your cutting board cutting up a jalapeno like really that's the pepper you're afraid of.

800
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:13,212
Speaker 0: yep But yeah, the Sun basket is uh It's okay, right?

801
00:56:13,393 --> 00:56:17,080
Speaker 0: I think the Some of the food from it was was kind of tasty.

802
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,327
Speaker 0: It makes you cook a little more.

803
00:56:18,447 --> 00:56:20,860
Speaker 0: one of them actually made me cook too much, right?

804
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,104
Speaker 0: It was like I had to have like two pots and the oven going at the same time and that was like I wasn't happy About that.

805
00:56:26,185 --> 00:56:27,395
Speaker 0: I was like, this is too much cooking.

806
00:56:27,476 --> 00:56:33,180
Speaker 1: Yeah That's the cooking I do on a special occasion that's not the cooking I do on a Tuesday, right exactly?

807
00:56:34,242 --> 00:56:35,540
Speaker 0: So that was kind of annoying.

808
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,636
Speaker 0: Quality was you know?

809
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:46,720
Speaker 1: I guess the last one I'll talk about is And we did this partly because you know Like I said, I couldn't get fresh direct deliveries for like a month when this whole thing started like it was hard to get groceries.

810
00:56:47,182 --> 00:57:05,219
Speaker 1: But we were doing the misfits market which isn't food kits so much as we will send you a variety of Vegetables and fruits and things that are either damaged or difficult to sell in a grocery store because they're shaped weird or whatever and they're real cheap and We've just been using it as like.

811
00:57:05,661 --> 00:57:12,304
Speaker 1: We get a whole bunch of vegetables and stuff every week and it supplements our food intake because we got to cook every goddamn day During kovat.

812
00:57:12,747 --> 00:57:13,109
Speaker 1: Okay.

813
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:14,879
Speaker 1: I don't want to go out to grocery stores if I can avoid it.

814
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,140
Speaker 1: Fresh direct sells out of things like because there's supply chain issues.

815
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:27,181
Speaker 1: So we've diversified our ways to get food into our house And this was a good way to get a lot of vegetables that are perfectly fine for not a lot of money Mm-hmm.

816
00:57:27,804 --> 00:57:31,660
Speaker 0: I just always the thing with something like that is I always worry about the food waste and also the pressure.

817
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,223
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

818
00:57:32,264 --> 00:57:34,196
Speaker 0: Here's what your random vegetables now.

819
00:57:34,216 --> 00:57:34,860
Speaker 0: You got to cook with them.

820
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,340
Speaker 1: Go go to a degree like they show like here's the things that are available.

821
00:57:38,481 --> 00:57:40,499
Speaker 1: You kind of look like I want some of those and some of those some of those.

822
00:57:41,301 --> 00:57:43,090
Speaker 1: The good things just tend to disappear real quick.

823
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:44,960
Speaker 1: Like you got to jump on the site early.

824
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:56,739
Speaker 1: But the only thing that's been too much is and other people who have this service have pointed out the same thing We end up having a lot of beets and a lot of squash hanging around because those are the things we don't use right away.

825
00:57:57,422 --> 00:58:03,165
Speaker 1: Yep, but those are also things that kind of last forever Like they're really bad.

826
00:58:03,185 --> 00:58:04,008
Speaker 0: Yeah.

827
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:09,350
Speaker 0: So one last thing I want to talk about is, you know fresh direct We said is not a meal kit situation, right?

828
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:11,360
Speaker 0: It's a it's just grocery store online.

829
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and then they deliver the groceries that you pick specifically.

830
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:17,251
Speaker 0: It's like it's the same as going to the grocery store or Amazon.

831
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:17,993
Speaker 0: fresh same thing.

832
00:58:18,014 --> 00:58:19,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it's it's my grocery store.

833
00:58:20,104 --> 00:58:21,200
Speaker 1: I don't go to grocery stores.

834
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:24,340
Speaker 0: I go to fresh exactly what you want and they give you exactly what you want.

835
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,653
Speaker 0: But fresh direct does offer a meal kit that you can choose to buy.

836
00:58:29,175 --> 00:58:30,539
Speaker 0: so we did buy one of those.

837
00:58:31,504 --> 00:58:33,514
Speaker 0: It was like a chicken broccoli thing.

838
00:58:33,554 --> 00:58:40,140
Speaker 0: I think yep, and I got to say it was the saddest I've heard that from other people.

839
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,348
Speaker 1: They're basically like they're the kind there's those.

840
00:58:42,408 --> 00:58:45,960
Speaker 1: they're those pseudo TV dinners that like grocery stores sell in the suburbs.

841
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,366
Speaker 0: sometimes it was literally.

842
00:58:47,386 --> 00:58:53,006
Speaker 0: I open up this box and inside is like a broccoli a Chicken and a rice and a sauce.

843
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,290
Speaker 0: Wow, and it's just like.

844
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:57,040
Speaker 0: I don't need to look at the instructions, but that's way sad.

845
00:58:57,281 --> 00:59:02,563
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like way better like you open up, but if you open up a Blue apron.

846
00:59:02,644 --> 00:59:04,410
Speaker 0: that was for chicken and broccoli, right?

847
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,960
Speaker 0: You would see a broccoli and a chicken, right?

848
00:59:07,342 --> 00:59:11,100
Speaker 0: But you would not see a sauce in there to apply, right?

849
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,487
Speaker 1: Oh, you would see like here's some spices and things.

850
00:59:13,527 --> 00:59:14,369
Speaker 1: you would see.

851
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:19,645
Speaker 0: you would see several ingredients with which to make the sauce Right together, right.

852
00:59:19,906 --> 00:59:25,680
Speaker 0: and you would also see like, you know more stuff to put in there besides just broccoli rice chicken.

853
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,484
Speaker 0: There would be like other.

854
00:59:26,505 --> 00:59:31,409
Speaker 0: it'd be like some peppery stuff some peppers to put in there Maybe like, you know some water chestnut.

855
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:37,233
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll be like, you know, it would be more busy Right and more varied contrasting tastes.

856
00:59:37,314 --> 00:59:42,192
Speaker 1: not so plain and sad Yeah I find with a place like fresh direct like the sweet spot for they'd also.

857
00:59:42,232 --> 00:59:48,293
Speaker 0: they probably have you roast that broccoli and then put It in as opposed to just like steam the broccoli and make it real sad.

858
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:52,430
Speaker 1: steam broccoli is usually pretty sad Yeah, but like the middle ground.

859
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:54,540
Speaker 1: there is the thing about like a place like fresh direct.

860
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,247
Speaker 1: That's good is not those kids?

861
00:59:56,267 --> 01:00:07,219
Speaker 1: because those kids are just those kids are the pits But they do have a lot of prepared food Like if I want to do a marinated pork chop or something like marinated meats and things like that.

862
01:00:07,922 --> 01:00:13,578
Speaker 1: I can buy them in bags with their marinade like already done and just ready for your grocery store.

863
01:00:13,618 --> 01:00:14,400
Speaker 0: has that exactly?

864
01:00:14,461 --> 01:00:15,976
Speaker 1: it's the kind of thing a regular grocery store does.

865
01:00:15,996 --> 01:00:20,620
Speaker 1: I Feel like that is a better option than getting a meal kit from most grocery stores.

866
01:00:22,943 --> 01:00:23,800
Speaker 0: Sure, but yeah.

867
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:41,739
Speaker 0: So I guess the the final thing is you know If you are someone who doesn't live with a big Family where you can go to the grocery store load up on large quantities and eat it all Yeah, or you have a busy life and you don't can't spend time meal planning or you you have few people You don't want to do food waste

868
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, or honestly if you

869
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:47,978
Speaker 0: like you like cooking you have the time to cook at least a quick 20 minute 30 minute meal.

870
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,767
Speaker 0: You just don't want to do it necessarily every day.

871
01:00:51,088 --> 01:00:56,306
Speaker 1: if you think you're a bad cook and you want to learn to get better You can almost treat it like a cooking class.

872
01:00:56,828 --> 01:01:00,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you have the money to afford one of these things, right?

873
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:04,558

904
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:05,994
Speaker 1: but anyway We are live streaming the show again as you may have seen and I now leave you with an outtake from the very beginning of that stream.

905
01:03:06,155 --> 01:03:07,764
Speaker 1: we just started to turn the show on.

906
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:11,881
Speaker 1: we were just about to record and Scott realized that his volume was way too low.

907
01:03:11,901 --> 01:03:13,450
Speaker 1: He's got as a problem.

908
01:03:14,032 --> 01:03:19,509
Speaker 1: There's a little preamplifier that Scott has at home with his rig and he just fucks with it.

909
01:03:19,932 --> 01:03:25,785
Speaker 1: He just like if he's sitting near it He'll just fuck with it and move the volume slider around even though he denies that he does this.

910
01:03:26,287 --> 01:03:29,589
Speaker 1: so uh Here's now take and see you guys next week.

911
01:03:30,731 --> 01:03:31,393
Speaker 1: What did you do?

912
01:03:31,534 --> 01:03:32,657
Speaker 1: Did you fiddle with the knob?

913
01:03:32,677 --> 01:03:34,544
Speaker 1: I think you fiddled with the knob.

914
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:38,186
Speaker 1: we you caught yourself telling with the knob No, I accidentally fiddle.

915
01:03:38,307 --> 01:03:43,930
Speaker 0: I Unconsciously fiddled with it before but I haven't touched it since you know the last episode.

916
01:03:44,252 --> 01:03:46,447
Speaker 1: I am not confident that you have not touched it since then.

917
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:51,403
Speaker 0: It's like way back on the desk or it's why did you fiddle with it the other day?

918
01:03:51,423 --> 01:03:52,868
Speaker 0: Well, I was just.

919
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:58,238
Speaker 1: you know Maybe in your sleep what I noticed.

920
01:03:58,278 --> 01:03:59,343
Speaker 0: I noticed that I did it.

921
01:03:59,825 --> 01:04:00,970
Speaker 0: How would I do it without noticing?

922
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:02,660
Speaker 1: I think you might have sleep fiddled like narrow.

923
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:03,525
Speaker 1: You just get up in the night.

924
01:04:03,546 --> 01:04:06,330
Speaker 1: You wander over there You fiddle with it on night and then you go back to sleep.

925
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:08,877
Speaker 0: Should I put a piece of tape leg on it?

926
01:04:09,921 --> 01:04:10,986
Speaker 1: I used to do that on the mixer.

927
01:04:11,046 --> 01:04:16,501
Speaker 1: I actually taped the Pre-faders in the positions I'd calibrated them to for all our different microphones.

928
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:20,130
Speaker 0: I moved it like a millimeter.

929
01:04:20,734 --> 01:04:22,264
Speaker 0: What did I move it in the wrong direction?

930
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:27,397
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you got quieter.

931
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:35,095
Speaker 1: As long as it doesn't clip in your audition That sounded too loud.

932
01:04:35,115 --> 01:04:36,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, obviously that's too loud.

933
01:04:37,101 --> 01:04:42,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, I started streaming so the listener Mm-hmm.
