1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,814
Speaker 0: It's Thursday October 19th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,854 --> 00:00:15,519
Speaker 0: We discussed the burden of proof.

3
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:18,277
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:22,860
Speaker 0: So today I ended up working in a place in the Bronx.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,400
Speaker 0: I normally don't work very very South Bronx as in right next to the river where I could see Manhattan.

6
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:29,885
Speaker 1: What kind of place was it?

7
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:30,487
Speaker 1: hospitals?

8
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:33,858
Speaker 0: Yeah big old hospital in a really economically depressed area.

9
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:34,520
Speaker 1: awesome.

10
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:37,491
Speaker 0: I parked my car behind a gate.

11
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:39,177
Speaker 1: Whoo good idea though.

12
00:00:39,197 --> 00:00:45,499
Speaker 0: actually the other day I went down to the same place, and I parked my car in the street on a shady alley next to an empty park.

13
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:47,715
Speaker 1: Uh-oh at least is a park.

14
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:48,359
Speaker 1: parks are cool.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,458
Speaker 0: Well the thing is my car looks kind of shady so I can park in a shady area.

16
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:53,441
Speaker 0: just fine Mr..

17
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:55,268
Speaker 1: Shade Shady McShade shade.

18
00:00:55,529 --> 00:01:06,100
Speaker 0: yeah, it'll be a couple more years before I buy a new car, but my car I mean it actually looks really nice except for the Small gash in the left side from when someone backed into it while was parked on the street earlier.

19
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:08,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, you told me about it, and then I saw it was pretty bad.

20
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,726
Speaker 0: I don't know really doesn't?

21
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:09,887
Speaker 0: it's?

22
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:10,791
Speaker 0: a tiny little dent.

23
00:01:10,832 --> 00:01:12,420
Speaker 0: I could pop it out with a rubber mallet.

24
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,870
Speaker 1: It's mostly those white streaks of the with a.

25
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:16,999
Speaker 0: actually half of that will wash off.

26
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,337
Speaker 0: Okay, I tried it.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,624
Speaker 1: I couldn't tell it like it.

28
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:25,706
Speaker 1: look it's hard to tell what of that is paint that scratched off and what of that is stuff That's rubbed onto your car.

29
00:01:25,726 --> 00:01:26,108
Speaker 0: That's stuff.

30
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,735
Speaker 0: That's rubbed on and I have touch-up paint.

31
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:28,719
Speaker 1: no touch-up paints.

32
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,820
Speaker 0: cool I just don't really care cuz I'd have to knock the dent out before I did anything.

33
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:41,393
Speaker 1: I like how my car didn't come with touch-up paint, but then a few months after I got the car They mailed me touch-up paint in the mail like here's a special gift.

34
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:43,400
Speaker 1: You know it's really expensive.

35
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:46,654
Speaker 1: Here's some touch-up paint, and I was like oh great the touch-up paint.

36
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:50,751
Speaker 0: You should have given me for free Yeah, like 40 bucks for a little thing of that.

37
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:51,092
Speaker 1: It's all.

38
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:51,936
Speaker 1: that's a lot of money.

39
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,410
Speaker 0: Yeah Car paint is it anyway.

40
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:55,680
Speaker 0: I'm down in this area.

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,073
Speaker 0: I haven't really been before and it's kind of out of the way.

42
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:03,720
Speaker 0: and to get home I'd had to take the Deegan Interstate 87 the New York State Thruway.

43
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:07,436
Speaker 1: You took 87 all the way here and cross the Hudson River twice.

44
00:02:07,476 --> 00:02:08,199
Speaker 1: That's a long way.

45
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,169
Speaker 0: well No, I took it most of the way up And then I cut off onto the taconic at an opportune moment.

46
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:18,169
Speaker 1: so before you went across the river you said oh shit No, actually I knew that it touches the taconic.

47
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,140
Speaker 0: I'll not too far before it goes across the river.

48
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:23,209
Speaker 0: It also touches the sawmill.

49
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,054
Speaker 0: I could have gotten off there.

50
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:29,891
Speaker 0: ooh sawmill You know what the sawmill can die in a goddamn fire.

51
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:33,810
Speaker 1: all those roads that go north out of New York City They're all fine.

52
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:37,933
Speaker 0: the taconic I can just blow down the taconic unless there's an accident.

53
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:41,619
Speaker 0: the Bear Mountain Beacon Expressway I can just fly right through at 90 miles an hour.

54
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:52,500
Speaker 0: My problem is the sawmill because the sawmill has traffic lights for the first like five miles Which isn't a big deal, but that completely and utterly stops fucking traffic.

55
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,200
Speaker 0: That's okay, and there's no way around it.

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:02,483
Speaker 0: The only other way is to take route 9 through like 10 tiny little five-person towns with speed limits of 25.

57
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:06,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just the Hudson River is so Poorly placed.

58
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:08,235
Speaker 1: it just gets in the way.

59
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:12,120
Speaker 1: if that wasn't there You know easy it would be to go north out of the city to get here.

60
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:19,200
Speaker 0: I think the problem is more than all the roads that go north out of New York City Were built before we understood how to make good highways.

61
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:25,640
Speaker 0: So they're not highways their parkways with at-grade entrances and at-grade exits and often traffic lights.

62
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:29,953
Speaker 0: Also, they're narrow and windy and often two lanes in any given direction.

63
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:30,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is true.

64
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:32,220
Speaker 1: It's out of New York City.

65
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:35,144
Speaker 1: It's mostly like two three You know it's.

66
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:37,904
Speaker 1: it's mostly two-lane roads But there's a lot of them.

67
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:46,197
Speaker 1: if it had been designed properly there would probably be like one or two Like five or six-lane roads that are all raised and superhighway.

68
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:53,680
Speaker 0: ish well You'd probably just have a superhighway that went from the top of Manhattan all the way up to like halfway to Albany.

69
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,951
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably and it probably go down through New Jersey and everything like that.

70
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,376
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no we don't have that.

71
00:03:59,476 --> 00:04:01,182
Speaker 1: nope nope instead It sucks.

72
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:03,311
Speaker 1: you got to pick one of a multitude of roads.

73
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:05,460
Speaker 1: Hope you pick the right one for that day.

74
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:08,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is the radio is useless.

75
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,800
Speaker 0: I thought oh, I'll listen to the radio and find out when the trap like if there's traffic.

76
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,891
Speaker 1: Well, if you do listen to 880 a.m.

77
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,608
Speaker 1: Which is I think the most powerful radio and radio station in the country you can get the news and traffic and weather on the 8th totally useless.

78
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,440
Speaker 1: traffic and weather is within eight minutes.

79
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,760
Speaker 0: I've already committed and I've never once heard a traffic update that saved me from anything.

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could sit in your car for 10 minutes Until the 8th and then that's just stupid and then go that's just really stupid.

81
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:43,822
Speaker 0: Hey and I tried to get you know traffic information online and I learned that all Traffic information online is either incorrect or useless.

82
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:44,906
Speaker 1: That's that's true.

83
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:45,849
Speaker 1: I don't know why that is.

84
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:52,070
Speaker 0: There is no single website that has accurate reliable good traffic information for the New York State area.

85
00:04:52,372 --> 00:05:01,610
Speaker 1: All someone really needs to do is you know You take a Google map and whenever there's a traffic incident on a major highway you you know, you put a little flag.

86
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,278
Speaker 1: This is major incident here.

87
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,706
Speaker 0: Here's the problem author South back.

88
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:05,530
Speaker 0: Here's the problem one.

89
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,961
Speaker 0: Most of those incidents aren't reported until later, especially not to you.

90
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:11,570
Speaker 1: I know they really need to report them much faster.

91
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:13,804
Speaker 1: I like the traffic cameras on the highways.

92
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:14,669
Speaker 0: I want more of them.

93
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:29,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean my mom before she goes somewhere cuz Connecticut has you know traffic highway cameras everywhere like the news always shows them you can just look at them online, which is how public camera should be and You'll just go and look at the cameras at the road.

94
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,166
Speaker 1: She's gonna go on you know, and then maybe take an alternate road if it looks like there's too many cars there.

95
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:36,172
Speaker 1: I Wish we had that.

96
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:36,835
Speaker 0: Yeah.

97
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:37,900
Speaker 0: All right.

98
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,390
Speaker 0: I also had a subway for lunch, which made me very unhappy.

99
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,758
Speaker 1: You went to subway the place.

100
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, I there was nothing.

101
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:46,630
Speaker 0: this area is really economically depressed.

102
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:50,550
Speaker 0: I didn't trust any of the places I saw to eat within walking distance.

103
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:53,646
Speaker 0: So I found a food court that had a subway in it.

104
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:56,930
Speaker 0: Oh I had an Italian combo.

105
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:01,949
Speaker 1: You know, there's very few things at subway that actually tastes good.

106
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,798
Speaker 1: You know, I mean it's okay to just get the breads.

107
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:08,630
Speaker 1: Okay, it's bread, you know the stuff they put the vegetables or vegetables.

108
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,513
Speaker 1: It's terrible.

109
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:11,320
Speaker 0: It's the terrible subs.

110
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty bad.

111
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,087
Speaker 1: Yeah.

112
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:13,910
Speaker 0: So what do you got in the news?

113
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,050
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk about subway.

114
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,509
Speaker 0: All right.

115
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:33,047
Speaker 1: so everyone knows or you should know that Nintendo promised that Zelda Twilight Princess would come out for GameCube and then Wii and it was told to everyone that the GameCube version would come out a Week before the Wii version which is such a brilliant yet evil move.

116
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:37,801
Speaker 1: Yeah now They've decided that in Japan.

117
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:43,042
Speaker 1: This is old news that in Japan They weren't going to sell the GameCube version in stores.

118
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:44,770
Speaker 1: They were only gonna sell it online.

119
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:55,570
Speaker 1: So if you want it in Japan if you're a Japanese person and you want Zelda Twilight Princess for the GameCube You got to order it online But they were still gonna sell it in the US in the stores.

120
00:06:56,434 --> 00:07:07,621
Speaker 1: today people who work at EB and GameStop are reporting all over the place and this is confirmed pretty much that the What the SKU the SKU?

121
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:15,385
Speaker 1: For a GameCube Zelda Twilight Princess, it's been removed from all the computer systems.

122
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:16,348
Speaker 1: It's not in there anymore.

123
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:21,401
Speaker 1: Uh-huh People are pretty much saying up they're not gonna sell it in stores.

124
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:23,890
Speaker 1: The question is are they gonna sell it online?

125
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,084
Speaker 1: Well, maybe you know, they they sell the electro plankton.

126
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,750
Speaker 1: that game was sold online.

127
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:34,628
Speaker 1: It was also sold in stores, but it was mostly sold online in Nintendo US.

128
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:39,010
Speaker 1: So We'll see if GameCube Zelda Twilight Princess comes.

129
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:47,743
Speaker 0: You know, this could be a little bit of a test of Nintendo to see Exactly how well they could just cut out the middleman and sell their games direct.

130
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:54,042
Speaker 0: Who knows who knows but I'm because no no normal parent would have bought that game.

131
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:56,090
Speaker 0: that game purely in the realm of.

132
00:07:57,631 --> 00:07:59,016
Speaker 0: I'm a fanboy and I need it.

133
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:06,001
Speaker 1: Yeah, here's my thinking now, right if this game isn't sold in stores This might be a rare awesome game to get.

134
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:06,302
Speaker 1: be like.

135
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,470
Speaker 1: I got the GameCube Twilight Princess bitches.

136
00:08:08,932 --> 00:08:09,714
Speaker 0: You know what that?

137
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:18,330
Speaker 1: if there's not maybe they're doing it on purpose to make me think that You know, so it's like should I buy the GameCube one a week before the week comes out or not?

138
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,112
Speaker 0: You know what?

139
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:23,990
Speaker 0: The only rare games that I care about are the gold cartridge Zelda's and I have them both.

140
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:35,030
Speaker 1: So I kind of want those like the Nintendo World Championship cartridges like not even to have because they're you know They go for so much in eBay just to play it once to you know.

141
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,118
Speaker 1: See how I would have done.

142
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,530
Speaker 0: and sure there are ROMs out there.

143
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,136
Speaker 1: I think there is a ROM but I haven't.

144
00:08:39,357 --> 00:08:44,376
Speaker 0: I found a ROM for the Nintendo official Diagnostic cartridge awesome.

145
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:46,485
Speaker 0: You can find a ROM for that.

146
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:47,629
Speaker 0: I guarantee it.

147
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,105
Speaker 1: Maybe there aren't so many of these cartridges out there, but we'll find one maybe someday.

148
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:53,370
Speaker 0: Yes, someday.

149
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:54,434
Speaker 0: All right.

150
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:55,277
Speaker 0: All right.

151
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:59,110
Speaker 0: So this is actually really interesting news that I found.

152
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:07,549
Speaker 0: I found it a while ago and I was thinking of doing a whole show on it But I couldn't wait anymore because eventually you guys will all notice that has been sitting in my delicious for a while unspoken about.

153
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:12,375
Speaker 0: according to the US Census is 2005 something something to study.

154
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:13,459
Speaker 0: I forget the name of the study.

155
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,649
Speaker 0: They apparently have recently released all of the data for it.

156
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:27,030
Speaker 0: For the first time ever there are more Non-married non-traditional households in the United States than there are married traditional households.

157
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:34,509
Speaker 0: More people are in the in the eyes of fundamentalist Christians living in sin than not living in sin as of now.

158
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:58,150
Speaker 0: Fifty point two percent of American households are non-standard meaning they are either a single mother heading a household a single father heading a household or Heterosexual or homosexual Partners of either gender living together for various reasons or bachelors or no No, they don't count people who live alone.

159
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,437
Speaker 0: So the numbers are actually even higher.

160
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:05,630
Speaker 0: there are fifty five point eight million non-traditional households in the u.s.

161
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:09,442
Speaker 0: They're an additional thirty million men and women living completely alone.

162
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:10,506
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

163
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,710
Speaker 0: They don't count as households.

164
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:13,585
Speaker 1: Why you live alone?

165
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:14,009
Speaker 1: You don't cut?

166
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,170
Speaker 0: No, you know the definition of a household is multiple people living in a house.

167
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:31,836
Speaker 1: anyway, the point is is the Family the you the normal family in nuclear family mother father 2.5 children dog is To dying.

168
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,003
Speaker 0: Well, it's not.

169
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:36,077
Speaker 0: it's not dying It's just it's on the decline.

170
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,503
Speaker 0: But the thing is so it's dying.

171
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:40,133
Speaker 0: It's on the decline rapidly It's not dying.

172
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:45,570
Speaker 0: that dying implies that it'll go away, which I highly doubt it will maybe in the long long long run.

173
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:46,694
Speaker 0: No, probably not.

174
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:57,982
Speaker 0: There's no evidence at all to suggest that if it's declining Signs of increasing, um Scott something that's declining like this There's no indication that it's going to decline fully.

175
00:10:58,002 --> 00:10:59,690
Speaker 0: these things tend to level off.

176
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:08,870
Speaker 0: I mean if anything, it'll probably decline to a static level and remain there Perhaps until something else comes along to make it decline more and more.

177
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:12,721
Speaker 0: Okay, I think you're reading way too much into this study.

178
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:15,449
Speaker 1: Anyway, what does this mean for us?

179
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:21,270
Speaker 0: It means awesome, I think all it really means is that there are a lot of people who aren't getting married anymore.

180
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:29,710
Speaker 0: I mean the divorce rate beat the marriage rate and Marriage is actually very rapidly becoming something that is not desirable by the majority of Americans.

181
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:34,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess so but the gay people seem to really really want to get married.

182
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:40,470
Speaker 1: So who knows me, you know, is it people still want to get married or is it people?

183
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,963
Speaker 1: Just can't make their marriages work and they really even though they really want them to.

184
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:56,073
Speaker 0: I think a lot of that just comes down to the fact that a lot of people marry people they don't actually like as evidenced by Many of the people I have met in my working professional career who complain about their spouses Constantly.

185
00:11:56,636 --> 00:12:07,170
Speaker 0: and yet when I try to say here's here's what this study says to me Our generation is finally smarter than the previous generation when it comes to love and family and marriages.

186
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:14,500
Speaker 0: Because all of the older people I've known always try to say, you know Yeah, you're just not married yet.

187
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:18,799
Speaker 0: someday in the next five years or so You'll get married and you'll be miserable just like I am.

188
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:35,640
Speaker 0: you'll have kids and they'll drain you dry of money and you'll hate Your wife and you'll live in a giant house miserable and everything will suck and you'll work long hours to stay away from them and a marriage will cost a lot of money and you're gonna spend all this money and blah blah blah and you'll never have sex anymore and blah blah blah blah.

189
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,080
Speaker 0: and They honestly just tell me yeah, you dumb kid.

190
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,866
Speaker 0: You don't realize that it happens to everyone.

191
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:41,649
Speaker 0: It'll happen to you, too.

192
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:46,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think this definitely shows that people just aren't doing that anymore.

193
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:47,817
Speaker 1: You know, it's like it used to be.

194
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:48,863
Speaker 1: that was the thing to do.

195
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:50,049
Speaker 1: people did it.

196
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:55,518
Speaker 1: Who knows what their reasons were but that was you know, the way to be was, you know You went to school.

197
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:56,323
Speaker 1: You got a job.

198
00:12:56,585 --> 00:12:57,410
Speaker 1: You made a family.

199
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,444
Speaker 1: It was sort of like the thing to do and it was the status quo.

200
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:05,205
Speaker 1: and now people are While they're still doing the other parts, you know go to school get a job.

201
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:07,916
Speaker 1: for the most part They're not doing that whole.

202
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:11,970
Speaker 1: make a family part at least not in the way that it's been done for many many years.

203
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:12,876
Speaker 0: See except now.

204
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:17,466
Speaker 0: here's why your thing about yeah It's gonna die out is kind of BS and not gonna happen.

205
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:34,629
Speaker 0: most likely The shift is primarily in urban areas as in almost all of these non-traditional households are in the metropolitan areas of major cities or in the suburbs of major cities and almost all cool people are and almost all Of the traditional households are in the Midwest of America.

206
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:42,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, like literally they're all like, you know the Midwest and generally rural areas and undeveloped areas.

207
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:46,909
Speaker 1: You know rural areas, you know, we always pick on them because they're behind the times.

208
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:54,538
Speaker 1: But if you go back in time the rural areas now are Would be you know modern for those times.

209
00:13:54,699 --> 00:14:00,169
Speaker 1: So, you know 50 years from now the rural areas now Will be will be like now.

210
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:08,079
Speaker 0: I think that's a silly gross over simplification that overlooks the fact that rural life is just inherently different from urban life and always has been it is.

211
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:13,436
Speaker 0: in the days of the Romans urban and rural were very different because it's Different kind of world a different kind of living.

212
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:18,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they eventually, you know, they weren't behind the city They're behind the times.

213
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:19,637
Speaker 0: in what way?

214
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:26,470
Speaker 0: in many ways such as modern ways of thinking Like what there are a lot of progressive people in the Midwest.

215
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,970
Speaker 1: Yeah in the Midwest but not living in the boonies.

216
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:34,403
Speaker 0: Well by the Midwest I meant the boonies, you know the middle of America.

217
00:14:34,724 --> 00:14:36,870
Speaker 1: the people in the boonies are not hip and cool.

218
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:38,927
Speaker 0: How do you know a lot of people who move out there hippies?

219
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,398
Speaker 1: Yeah hippies aren't hip.

220
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,410
Speaker 1: there's a difference in a hipster and hippie.

221
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:47,288
Speaker 0: Alright, I just I don't really see what you're going at here.

222
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,480
Speaker 1: Eventually, you know stuff that's you know happening in the cities.

223
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:54,450
Speaker 1: It's exported and spreads around to the rural areas.

224
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,116
Speaker 1: It takes a long time for it to get out there.

225
00:14:56,276 --> 00:15:02,619
Speaker 0: what like living in apartment complexes with a lot of people and not having Agriculture that's never gonna get to rural areas.

226
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,210
Speaker 1: then we'll run out of food but other aspects of life.

227
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:12,630
Speaker 0: Okay, like pop culture type things and social culture pop culture is bigger out there than it is in urban areas.

228
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,508
Speaker 0: Urban areas are much more alternative pop culture.

229
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:15,729
Speaker 0: now.

230
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:24,377
Speaker 1: Yes The point is that because the the alternative pop culture is the pop culture in the urban areas and the pop pop culture While it's there.

231
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:25,444
Speaker 0: I don't think it's the majority.

232
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:26,310
Speaker 0: even in urban areas.

233
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:30,269
Speaker 0: I mean even in New York City most people watch American Idol and all that crap.

234
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:39,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the stuff that's you know The you know that the cities is where the stuff that's down low Bubbles up to the top and becomes the American Idol type crap.

235
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,070
Speaker 1: You know it moves up to that level and then it goes from there out to the rest of the country.

236
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:50,643
Speaker 1: You know, that's where that's kind of stuff is grown, you know You know, yeah, you know and the rural areas is to where it's distributed.

237
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:52,169
Speaker 1: It just takes time for that stuff to happen.

238
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:58,505
Speaker 0: Well, the only point here is that the household in which I live is now the majority.

239
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:02,936
Speaker 0: and to all of you with families Things might be changing a little bit.

240
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:08,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe all those, you know groups that are like, you know Family interest.

241
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,338
Speaker 0: I gotta interrupt you.

242
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:10,481
Speaker 0: I was gonna wait until the break.

243
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,608
Speaker 0: You said, you know about a thousand times.

244
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:13,290
Speaker 1: What the hell?

245
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:20,276
Speaker 1: I'm sorry You know all those groups There's no.

246
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:21,529
Speaker 1: why am I supposed to start the sentence?

247
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:23,948
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know.

248
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:33,778
Speaker 1: So all those groups better, you know protect our family Family interests or All that stuff.

249
00:16:33,838 --> 00:16:35,350
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll be losing a lot of power.

250
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,550
Speaker 1: If the majority of the country is not families then the interests of families will hold less sway.

251
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:44,341
Speaker 1: Your supposed family interests and values.

252
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:54,730
Speaker 0: see the thing is households that have children are still primarily at least as far as most of the studies go Normal traditional households with a mother and a father or some variety thereof.

253
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:06,229
Speaker 0: But the other thing is that people are breeding less and less so that there are more and more Households that are comprised of friends or lovers or people who don't intend to have children or people who just don't have children.

254
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:15,593
Speaker 1: yet You know Things that you know.

255
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:21,289
Speaker 1: the you know day day, you know, you know, you know, all right.

256
00:17:22,173 --> 00:17:27,164
Speaker 0: So I had a couple things today that were kind of you know I have a bunch of you know Things of the day.

257
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:31,080
Speaker 0: nothing really really crazy cool stood out and I was gonna pick one of them.

258
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:47,780
Speaker 0: But then our good friend Lisa had left a message for me and upon further investigation Lisa had sent me a link to a website that lists in generally real time all of the health outbreaks Epidemics that sort of thing in the world via Ajax and Google Maps.

259
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:52,700
Speaker 1: Well, do they really mean like epidemics like holy crap the whole town is, you know got a disease?

260
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,748
Speaker 1: Well, I mean just like.

261
00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:00,120
Speaker 0: well as in you know outbreaks Uh-huh Outbreaks of disease and you can pick by disease.

262
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:03,739
Speaker 0: You can click on anthrax and see all the outbreaks of anthrax on the map.

263
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:07,130
Speaker 1: Well, this does one anthrax count as an anthrax outbreak.

264
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:18,605
Speaker 0: Well, if you click on one, it'll show you all of the related ones And it gathers it from all sorts of different news sources of varying reliability and applies certain metrics to it to figure out what is Going on.

265
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:20,040
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

266
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:28,200
Speaker 1: So before you go on a trip Check out this map to make sure you're not going somewhere that's loaded with diseases or just look up your hometown and then freak out.

267
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,470
Speaker 0: When a thousand kids died of E.

268
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:33,654
Speaker 1: Coli two days ago I'm sure you would have seen that on some sort of local news source.

269
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:34,920
Speaker 0: I don't watch local news.

270
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:39,020
Speaker 1: I did do I but I would find out if there was a thousand E. Coli's around here.

271
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,837
Speaker 0: Maybe I have zero contact with local news at this point.

272
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:46,107
Speaker 0: I've realized I mean, I don't listen to the radio.

273
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:47,071
Speaker 1: Look who loses.

274
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:47,934
Speaker 1: kind of important.

275
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:49,079
Speaker 0: We don't even have TV.

276
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:54,560
Speaker 0: No internet site covers aren't our local news at all in any reason.

277
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:02,980
Speaker 1: I actually found out recently that if we have cable television Which we don't that one of the channels is the beacon channel and there's beacon town stuff on that channel.

278
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we're gonna pay for cable.

279
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,037
Speaker 1: No, we're not.

280
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:09,610
Speaker 1: But I figure we need some sort of local something.

281
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:10,593
Speaker 0: So sure enough.

282
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:14,868
Speaker 0: I looked and yeah a kid got polio in Kenya Sucks, why didn't he get the vaccine?

283
00:19:15,992 --> 00:19:16,354
Speaker 0: I don't know.

284
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:17,980
Speaker 0: I didn't read the actual thing.

285
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,389
Speaker 0: Maybe he did and it didn't work.

286
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:21,180
Speaker 0: Maybe he probably just wasn't vaccinated.

287
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:32,371
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean, you know all those nuts in America now who are trying to not vaccinate their kids against things because they think that the Thermosol or whatever that isn't even in a lot of vaccines causes autism.

288
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:35,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can think of other reasons to not get a vaccine.

289
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:37,810
Speaker 0: There's no reason to not get a vaccine.

290
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,372
Speaker 0: Yeah.

291
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:40,240
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the vaccine.

292
00:19:41,282 --> 00:19:42,666
Speaker 1: The thing is the vaccine will not 100%.

293
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:47,100
Speaker 1: it is possible to get a vaccine and not get and still get polio.

294
00:19:47,842 --> 00:19:48,584
Speaker 1: It is possible.

295
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:49,466
Speaker 0: So what's your point?

296
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:52,736
Speaker 0: Everyone should be vaccinated against everything that needs vaccination.

297
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:53,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, really?

298
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:54,320
Speaker 0: No two ways about it.

299
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,123
Speaker 0: It's a good idea.

300
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,668
Speaker 1: But you know what.

301
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,454
Speaker 1: it's not a hundred percent awesome.

302
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:00,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I percent awesome.

303
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:09,194
Speaker 0: No, it's a hundred percent awesome because in the few cases where a vaccine causes harm It still is much to the benefit of society if everyone is vaccinated.

304
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:13,259
Speaker 0: if there are people who aren't vaccinated We lose our herd immunity against a lot of diseases.

305
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:23,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, we do but at the same time we don't evolve a natural immunity, um There's really no selection pressure regardless of whether or not we do that.

306
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:25,260
Speaker 1: I know I want to get some selection pressure going on.

307
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,040
Speaker 0: So you want millions of people to die on a regular basis?

308
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,581
Speaker 1: No I'm figuring we should just get up like a group of people together in our own little society and that society will have some selection Pressure.

309
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:39,560
Speaker 0: screw the rest of the what how the selection pressure means you prevent people from breeding in some way?

310
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,659
Speaker 0: No, they die Before they breed.

311
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:56,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, so in a small population you expect that by not vaccinating people against diseases Some of them will die thereby eventually over the course of tens of thousands of years generate an immunity in that population.

312
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,029
Speaker 1: Maybe that's well, you know, it may be.

313
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:16,860
Speaker 1: as some people move to the moon those people would Slowly, you know the people who couldn't live on the moon and didn't have good, you know Traits to live on the moon, but you know, yeah And the other people who did well on the moon would live and breed some more and we'd have awesome moon people.

314
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:22,540
Speaker 0: I gotta say I'm much more in favor of just using science and technology to overcome our genetic failings.

315
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:23,805
Speaker 1: Oh, you lazy bum.

316
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,593
Speaker 1: You got no patience to wait 10 million.

317
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:27,340
Speaker 0: I want to be a coordinator.

318
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:30,170
Speaker 1: We gotta wait 10 million years.

319
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,240
Speaker 1: that didn't develop our own business.

320
00:21:32,642 --> 00:21:44,209
Speaker 0: That's the way I gotta say if I were to become a father somehow And and I and there was a way to make them a coordinator like in Gundam seed That the question wouldn't be yes or no.

321
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,800
Speaker 0: The question would just be when or how much money?

322
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:53,963
Speaker 1: And then they'll have a sorrow filled life of Torment.

323
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:57,620
Speaker 0: Yeah followed by awesome at the end of their life with a giant robot.

324
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:03,060
Speaker 1: But they'll be forced to fight with giant robots and protect their friends from horrible disaster.

325
00:22:04,762 --> 00:22:07,959
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe or they'll just be awesome and then they'll live an awesome life.

326
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:13,940
Speaker 0: It could be they'll be the con chair of every anime con tough call piloting giant robots around left and right.

327
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:17,391
Speaker 1: Anyway, my thing of the day is a YouTube video of this kid.

328
00:22:17,632 --> 00:22:23,393
Speaker 1: in it says India and it says as a girl Even though I think it's a dude, but who can say okay.

329
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:25,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, who is roller skating?

330
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:40,455
Speaker 1: and this kid roller skates a whole real fast down a hill and then does a complete split like whoop and puts their hands on their ankles and You know puts their body, you know, yeah, I think I'm gonna go every time.

331
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:41,679
Speaker 0: you you know for the rest of the show.

332
00:22:42,623 --> 00:22:54,759
Speaker 1: So this kid is on roller skates going real fast slightly downhill yeah, completely flat against the ground limbo champion of the world flat and The kid goes under a bunch of cars.

333
00:22:55,422 --> 00:22:59,560
Speaker 0: It's really kind of crazy watching this because the kid just goes whoop and disappears under this big truck.

334
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:02,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it says the kid goes under 40 cars.

335
00:23:04,062 --> 00:23:05,334
Speaker 0: You can't go under 40 cars.

336
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:08,366
Speaker 1: It might be 40 cars.

337
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:08,687
Speaker 1: I can't.

338
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:10,835
Speaker 0: you can't really tell it takes a while.

339
00:23:11,377 --> 00:23:12,260
Speaker 1: It does take a while.

340
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:13,553
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it might be 40 cars.

341
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:21,649
Speaker 0: See the thing is, you know You're waiting for this kid to come back out if he hit his head or she hit her head and you know Just stopped and was hurt under there.

342
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:23,600
Speaker 0: It'd be a while before anyone figure.

343
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,536
Speaker 1: They would just move the two adjacent cars because there was someone watching with the camera.

344
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:28,640
Speaker 1: That's why this is on YouTube.

345
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:29,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

346
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,330
Speaker 0: I couldn't see anything in the camera when it showed.

347
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,360
Speaker 0: I just saw a blob that may or may not have been moving.

348
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:33,883
Speaker 1: Oh, I could.

349
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:35,470
Speaker 1: I saw the kid very clearly.

350
00:23:35,511 --> 00:23:37,420
Speaker 1: I could see the wheels on the roller skates and everything.

351
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:37,885
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

352
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:39,360
Speaker 1: You just need bad bad eyes.

353
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:45,880
Speaker 0: Anyway, maybe it was the fact that it's on your crappy laptop with its terrible angle of viewing and I was standing on my bed.

354
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:46,463
Speaker 1: It's still.

355
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:47,790
Speaker 1: I could see it from my angle.

356
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,218
Speaker 1: So that's all that matters.

357
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:54,980
Speaker 1: Okay Anyway, I'm sure the people there could see it even better because they didn't have YouTube compression blocking their eyesight.

358
00:23:56,382 --> 00:24:11,486
Speaker 1: however The thing I want to talk about in this video is after the kid emerges right all these people from all over are like cheering and dancing and partying in the street and they pick the kid up and the kid gets laid and Everything's awesome.

359
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,460
Speaker 1: And I just you know, it reminds me a lot.

360
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:21,780
Speaker 1: It reminds me when I was a kid and people were like that, you know, the neighborhood had a community.

361
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,220
Speaker 1: You know people would come out of their house and talk to each other and you could party in the street.

362
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:30,113
Speaker 0: See I had to say it, but I don't really like that.

363
00:24:30,314 --> 00:24:31,518
Speaker 0: I kind of disagree with that.

364
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:32,140
Speaker 1: Why not?

365
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,398
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

366
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:38,960
Speaker 1: Look, it'd be nice to live in a place where everyone was all friendly and happy and no friendly and happy is one thing.

367
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:45,877
Speaker 0: But in almost everywhere I've lived physically until I went to college and lived with people I actually had shared interest with.

368
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:56,400
Speaker 0: I Had almost nothing in common with any of my neighbors and I really had no desire to ever really talk to them And I certainly couldn't bring myself to stand around and cheer in the street.

369
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,239
Speaker 0: I'm just really jaded and I find it really difficult to get into something that much.

370
00:25:01,062 --> 00:25:16,772
Speaker 1: Oh, I think it'd be awesome to live in the place where you know, you you know, even if you don't yeah Even if you're not the best friends in the whole world and have you know have things in common with your neighbors You know doesn't mean you you know, you can ignore them.

371
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:21,326
Speaker 1: What the hell you keep saying, you know You're just gonna turn this into the you know show.

372
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:27,542
Speaker 1: it's totally making what I'm saying, you know that not get through Whatever.

373
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:28,164
Speaker 0: All right.

374
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:28,706
Speaker 0: I'm just fine.

375
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:34,060
Speaker 0: I keep saying, you know, alright, it's a bad trend if this keeps up It's gonna be the you know show with rim and Scott.

376
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:36,352
Speaker 1: It's only turning to you know show.

377
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:40,732
Speaker 0: cuz you're pointing out No, cuz yeah, I think you've been doing it for a little couple days now.

378
00:25:41,455 --> 00:25:42,500
Speaker 0: I think there's something in your food.

379
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:43,109
Speaker 0: I think you're eating the.

380
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,658
Speaker 0: you know beans.

381
00:25:45,062 --> 00:25:46,598
Speaker 1: You know beans, you know beans.

382
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:54,699
Speaker 1: You read five, you know You know.

383
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:56,629
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah.

384
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:02,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got it Even if I'm not best friends in the world and even if my neighbors aren't awesome geek.

385
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:03,998
Speaker 1: So I want to hang out with all the time.

386
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:08,778
Speaker 1: It's still nice to be friendly with your neighbors and have block parties and see I don't.

387
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:10,680
Speaker 0: it's cool I don't have time for stuff like that.

388
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,774
Speaker 0: I mean, I want to spend time with people who I can talk to.

389
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:15,099
Speaker 0: I really can't talk to.

390
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,370
Speaker 0: well I mean I meet a lot of people in town Especially when I worked at IBM and I often had time to.

391
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:22,280
Speaker 0: you know, now I'm saying it's infectious.

392
00:26:22,643 --> 00:26:23,670
Speaker 0: Uh-huh what you're doing to me.

393
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,959
Speaker 0: I should put it on the Google Maps.

394
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:28,580
Speaker 1: Maybe you do it all the time and I just don't pay attention point it out.

395
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:30,969
Speaker 0: Now I usually say other things.

396
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,760
Speaker 0: I have my own tics and I'm well aware of them.

397
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,644
Speaker 1: Yeah, what is rooms?

398
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:35,191
Speaker 1: What words does room say all the time?

399
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:36,236
Speaker 0: You know what I say the most.

400
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:41,612
Speaker 0: I say now Pause the thing I was going to say now pause the thing I'm going to say.

401
00:26:41,632 --> 00:26:41,712
Speaker 0: Yeah.

402
00:26:42,294 --> 00:26:42,495
Speaker 1: Yeah.

403
00:26:42,956 --> 00:26:44,802
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

404
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:48,615
Speaker 0: So anyway, I don't have time to be doing that anymore.

405
00:26:48,996 --> 00:27:01,318
Speaker 0: and even when I did, you know I used to go walking around a lot in town before I worked down and I had a long commute and I met a lot of people and they always struck up conversations and It was always a little interesting, you know meeting someone new and talking to them.

406
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:14,347
Speaker 0: But I couldn't talk about a single thing I was interested in because never did I run into someone in beacon or in fish kill or in poke way or in Poughkeepsie Who had any interest in anything.

407
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,315
Speaker 0: I had to say that I cared about the most.

408
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,580
Speaker 0: room didn't know anything about computers.

409
00:27:17,944 --> 00:27:19,139
Speaker 0: They didn't play video games.

410
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:20,806
Speaker 0: They didn't care about anime.

411
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:35,199
Speaker 0: one of them wanted to tell the only cool guy ever met wanted to tell me about how he was on a ship that took the people from when the That other ship was attacked by the Israelis during the war When they want a US ship was attacked and he knew people around that ship.

412
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:40,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I know most people in town don't care what I you know about the things that I'm really really interested in.

413
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,029
Speaker 1: They're not gonna listen to geek nights.

414
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:53,958
Speaker 1: They don't they don't give a shit Yeah, and which is why I'm not gonna hang out with them all the time and constantly have deep long Conversations with them but it you know, at least to be cordial with them as human beings.

415
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:57,267
Speaker 0: Yeah Cordiality goes doesn't go beyond they.

416
00:27:57,347 --> 00:27:59,213
Speaker 1: also I'm interested in pretty much it.

417
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:07,296
Speaker 1: almost anyone has to say at least once You know, it's cool to do what I didn't say, you know, yes you did Just said it.

418
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:10,580
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm not gonna stop the recording.

419
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:13,060
Speaker 0: Our listeners can tell you that you said it.

420
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:19,602
Speaker 1: It's cool to be able to walk around your neighborhood and see people and know who they are instead of just giving them kind of Stairs.

421
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,428
Speaker 0: see I'm very friendly to people.

422
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:22,291
Speaker 0: I'm cordial to me.

423
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:25,200
Speaker 0: cordial means if I see someone I acknowledge their existence.

424
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:26,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not gonna.

425
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:29,047
Speaker 0: small talk about the weather I'm not gonna.

426
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:29,913
Speaker 0: I hate that.

427
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:30,880
Speaker 0: I hate small talk.

428
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:42,845
Speaker 1: I hate just well, but if some kid down the street is roller skating under 40 cars I think it'd be a lot cooler if all the people, you know from around came out, you know to see and we're like Hey, you said, you know again.

429
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:43,848
Speaker 1: I didn't know.

430
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:47,700
Speaker 0: you did whatever you said, you know again, I think you're insane.

431
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,794
Speaker 0: I'll just know one last time that this is all being recorded.

432
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:58,800
Speaker 0: You know, we're doing a podcast So you're free to say that you didn't just say, you know, but I've got a record of what we said.

433
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,314
Speaker 0: So if you're confident, you know what we'll see what was said.

434
00:29:01,536 --> 00:29:04,002
Speaker 0: I'll bet you $100.

435
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:04,544
Speaker 1: I've got it.

436
00:29:04,624 --> 00:29:05,126
Speaker 1: You're only $100.

437
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:06,069
Speaker 1: Sure.

438
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:08,980
Speaker 0: I'll bet you because that's what I got in my wallet right now.

439
00:29:09,602 --> 00:29:09,723
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

440
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:10,366
Speaker 0: I have a little over $100.

441
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:12,334
Speaker 1: I got nothing on my wallet, so I can't bet.

442
00:29:12,897 --> 00:29:13,540
Speaker 0: I'll lend you credit.

443
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,648
Speaker 0: No, so you're not that sure.

444
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,459
Speaker 1: I'm not sure of anything which is what this episode is about.

445
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:23,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just I I mean a lot.

446
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:32,300
Speaker 0: like our town has a lot of festivals and get-togethers I go to them occasionally because I like to get you know an elephant here or some deep-fried something's or some lemonade.

447
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:45,578
Speaker 0: but the people I really don't have any way to hang out with or talk to on any intellectual level and I really just don't have the time or the inclination to deal with people that I'm not interested in.

448
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:46,991
Speaker 0: I mean no offense to them.

449
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:47,880
Speaker 0: I don't think they're bad people.

450
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:55,383
Speaker 1: I'm just not interested in them on a personal basis, but people in your neighborhood a neighborhood community isn't about having Conversations with people.

451
00:29:55,423 --> 00:29:57,168
Speaker 1: it isn't about being intellectual with people.

452
00:29:57,188 --> 00:29:59,755
Speaker 1: It isn't about spending a lot of time.

453
00:29:59,955 --> 00:30:01,740
Speaker 1: So it's not about anything in particular.

454
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:02,984
Speaker 1: it is there.

455
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:03,648
Speaker 1: there are more.

456
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:09,209
Speaker 1: there are other ways to interact and You know join up with other human beings.

457
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:13,145
Speaker 1: then in the way that we do it with geeky people You know what?

458
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:14,999
Speaker 0: I don't have any non geeky friends.

459
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:16,784
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know that.

460
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:18,389
Speaker 1: to be friends with them.

461
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:23,709
Speaker 1: You just you know, you'd be a queen someone's not who they are You know, you can rely on them.

462
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,769
Speaker 1: for like you can go over and say hey, you got a you know Can I borrow some sugar?

463
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,739
Speaker 0: I would never do that.

464
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:29,680
Speaker 1: See that's what I'm talking about.

465
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:34,380
Speaker 1: I would like to live in a place where people all the time went over and said hey could borrow some eggs.

466
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,500
Speaker 0: What's up, see I wouldn't want my neighbors bugging me all the time.

467
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,200
Speaker 0: I wouldn't want people knocking on my door who I kind of know asking to borrow screwdriver.

468
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,024
Speaker 0: I just wouldn't answer.

469
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:45,200
Speaker 1: the best was because it where my grandma lived in Queens, right?

470
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,460
Speaker 1: We would go sit out on the porch and people would walk down the street and you would say hey, how's it going Joe?

471
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,124
Speaker 1: What's up?

472
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:58,938
Speaker 1: Yeah when I when I was young and we lived in Detroit The door open on the house people would walk in and say hi and bring some food and take some food.

473
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:02,487
Speaker 1: and you know It's like a constant Happy go party time.

474
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:17,040
Speaker 0: see I now we live in this isolated, you know Kind of we're in our house and you're in there your house and as a way should be no I don't want people wandering into my house and borrowing my stuff or I just I really don't like interact.

475
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:22,939
Speaker 0: I don't like to inter put myself into Entanglements with people I don't care about.

476
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,045
Speaker 1: That's the thing is I you should.

477
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:28,880
Speaker 1: I would like to live in a place where people cared about the people they lived near.

478
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:31,120
Speaker 0: I care about him on an abstract human level.

479
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,399
Speaker 0: I care about them in a in a. you know, we all exist in the same world level.

480
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:38,473
Speaker 0: But I don't want to lend them my screwdriver.

481
00:31:38,494 --> 00:31:42,480
Speaker 0: I Would I mean if someone asked me for my screwdriver I'd give it to him.

482
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,740
Speaker 1: But I would prefer to live in a place where we cared about the people near us on a more than abstract human level.

483
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,925
Speaker 1: But it doesn't have to be.

484
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:52,190
Speaker 1: you know friend.

485
00:31:52,512 --> 00:31:54,460
Speaker 1: Why don't you come over and play a board game level?

486
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,765
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's it's like.

487
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:56,348
Speaker 0: well Scott.

488
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:58,820
Speaker 0: Let me put it in our the way we live our lives.

489
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, it doesn't matter what the community is like we never even have the opportunity to see people from our city.

490
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:09,260
Speaker 0: I think that's because wait because what how could we see people from our city?

491
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,160
Speaker 1: I think if the neighborhood was the way that I like it to be we would do it more often.

492
00:32:14,321 --> 00:32:15,954
Speaker 1: No, we don't walk it around.

493
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:16,640
Speaker 0: I wouldn't go walk.

494
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,627
Speaker 0: I don't have time for that.

495
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:24,400
Speaker 0: if I'm gonna go out walk and I'm gonna go out running So you'd go run around and see people and I go run in the mountains alone.

496
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:27,435
Speaker 0: So I run into hikers and sometimes they try to talk to me.

497
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:31,840
Speaker 0: every single time I've ever run into someone on the mountain with a couple exceptions.

498
00:32:32,523 --> 00:32:37,903
Speaker 0: They start talking to me and I have either have to make an excuse and get away or be stuck there for like a half Hour while they talk at me.

499
00:32:38,444 --> 00:32:39,126
Speaker 1: That's another thing.

500
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:44,060
Speaker 1: is that the way we live is that we have these very separated houses.

501
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,060
Speaker 1: I mean, it's our house and there's some car dealers and there's a Big buffer and then a neighbor's house.

502
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:50,961
Speaker 0: That's great Cuz.

503
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:54,795
Speaker 0: I want to be able to make a lot of noise and do whatever I want and not be bothering.

504
00:32:54,876 --> 00:33:01,460
Speaker 1: making noise is good But I would trade the you know freedom to make lots of noise if it was a whole lot more people.

505
00:33:02,002 --> 00:33:03,930
Speaker 0: I wouldn't not unless it was cool geeky people.

506
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm all about just people.

507
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:08,719
Speaker 0: if you're so How come you don't know anyone in town?

508
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,680
Speaker 0: Because it's you know, how come whenever the old lady is talking to us?

509
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,095
Speaker 0: You're always trying to get away from her because the old lady's kind of annoying everyone.

510
00:33:17,115 --> 00:33:17,979
Speaker 1: She talks too much.

511
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people around here like that.

512
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,137
Speaker 0: That's why I avoid people.

513
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:24,892
Speaker 1: now It's still you know, when you it's good you never.

514
00:33:24,912 --> 00:33:26,600
Speaker 1: I think you just never lived in a place.

515
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:30,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is friendly and when I lived in Detroit on a Harvard Street.

516
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:34,020
Speaker 0: Oh everyone we know all the neighbors and we'd sit on the porch at night.

517
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,092
Speaker 0: A lot of people would walk by.

518
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:35,820
Speaker 0: we lived on Berkshire.

519
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,703
Speaker 0: It was the same way.

520
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:44,220
Speaker 0: we had other family who lived like next door and down the street and I remember I used there's an Old lady's house next door and we knew them and we'd walk around the neighborhood.

521
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,640
Speaker 0: We knew other people and it was fun for a really little kid.

522
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,994
Speaker 0: But as an adult, I don't have time for that.

523
00:33:51,014 --> 00:33:52,400
Speaker 0: My life's too short to be bother.

524
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,380
Speaker 1: It's like when you go to Wildwood and you know, Scott Johnson's dad's friends are all walking around and it's all friendly.

525
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,380
Speaker 0: You know, I could care less about that.

526
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,175
Speaker 0: I'd rather just surround myself with all of my friends and meet new people I can actually talk to.

527
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:07,927
Speaker 1: and that's the problem with America's people aren't being friendly anymore.

528
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,295
Speaker 0: I'd rather people be honest than be fake friendly.

529
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:14,666
Speaker 1: It's not fake friendly real friendly Honest friendly.

530
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:16,719
Speaker 0: I'll say that there probably is a lot of fake friendly.

531
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:22,380
Speaker 1: It probably is but there's real friendly and that's the way it used to be see friendly to me.

532
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:31,146
Speaker 0: All you need is if you see someone on the street and you're not Adam and they nod back and then you go about your business you Suck, what do you want?

533
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:32,953
Speaker 0: I don't want to bother with people.

534
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:34,780
Speaker 0: I don't have any interest to share with.

535
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:45,877
Speaker 0: I don't want to spend any time with people that I can't in any way have an intellectual conversation Because intellectual conversations the only reason to interact with any people or to have fun or edges.

536
00:34:45,937 --> 00:34:46,237
Speaker 0: I can't.

537
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:46,860
Speaker 0: I don't have fun.

538
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,460
Speaker 0: I mean, I've got a lot of company picnics and things like that and I'll admit that they were mostly horrible and boring.

539
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:55,091
Speaker 0: I only went because they were during work hours.

540
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,080
Speaker 0: So I got out of work and I still got paid.

541
00:34:57,461 --> 00:35:02,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would never have gone to a single event with any of my jobs if I weren't paid to do it.

542
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:06,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I was even friends with some of the people at my jobs.

543
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:07,917
Speaker 0: I just had no desire.

544
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:08,660
Speaker 0: They weren't fun.

545
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,128
Speaker 0: It was a bunch of people standing around making small talk.

546
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,392
Speaker 0: No one said anything.

547
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:14,198
Speaker 0: really non small talk.

548
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:14,659
Speaker 0: ish ever.

549
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:16,523
Speaker 1: What do you know?

550
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:17,549
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

551
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:18,071
Speaker 0: What do I know?

552
00:35:18,091 --> 00:35:18,955
Speaker 0: That's how things are.

553
00:35:18,976 --> 00:35:19,800
Speaker 1: You're just an ass.

554
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:23,974
Speaker 1: I'm not an ass and you're like, yeah, all you people are peons.

555
00:35:24,195 --> 00:35:25,300
Speaker 1: You're not worth my time.

556
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,446
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna spend any time with you.

557
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:26,687
Speaker 0: You know.

558
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:30,890
Speaker 0: what I expect them to attitude is that see I Expect them to look at me the same way.

559
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:31,453
Speaker 0: They have.

560
00:35:31,553 --> 00:35:32,740
Speaker 0: they have no interest to share with me.

561
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,398
Speaker 0: Why would they want to spend their time on me?

562
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:40,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, if neither one of us have any shared interest then what kind of conversation could we possibly have?

563
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:41,220
Speaker 1: it's not just about conversation.

564
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:58,376
Speaker 1: What's it's about just having a community of people who join together and not just a bunch of separate Isolated people who don't communicate and aren't friendly and are just no hold up in their own little, you know Isolated TV watch and not caring about anyone else places.

565
00:35:58,396 --> 00:36:01,497
Speaker 1: I don't watch TV But what would you rather live in a you know?

566
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:02,943
Speaker 1: Happy town?

567
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:14,332
Speaker 1: or people walk down the street and you know the names of everybody and everyone's friendly or do you rather live in a place or everything's quiet and everyone's in their house and no one cares about anyone else on the street and Everyone does their own thing and it's

568
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:15,620
Speaker 0: all I know why I'd rather live.

569
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,476
Speaker 0: I'd rather live in a college campus where everyone was generally awesome and you had both and you.

570
00:36:20,536 --> 00:36:21,580
Speaker 0: everyone was friendly with everyone.

571
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,564
Speaker 0: You knew all these people.

572
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:26,400
Speaker 0: there were people walking around talking all the time, you know a million people all over campus.

573
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:30,955
Speaker 0: You have a million acquaintances But you're also surrounded by awesome people who have like interests.

574
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:37,500
Speaker 0: and the community Isn't just based on the fact that everyone in the community happens to live in the same physical place.

575
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,440
Speaker 0: It's based around the fact that everyone has generally common goals and interests.

576
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:45,380
Speaker 1: They're all the people who live in the same physical place have a lot of common goals and interests.

577
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:48,796
Speaker 1: Not really they do pertaining to the place in which they live.

578
00:36:48,837 --> 00:36:49,560
Speaker 1: It's like Scott.

579
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,744
Speaker 0: We live in a commuter town.

580
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:52,952
Speaker 0: Most of the places around here are commuter towns.

581
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:55,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of the why it's kind of crummy.

582
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:56,664
Speaker 0: I think it's fine.

583
00:36:56,724 --> 00:36:57,708
Speaker 0: I like beacon a lot.

584
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,233
Speaker 1: All right, whatever.

585
00:36:59,253 --> 00:37:01,200
Speaker 1: Let's do the actual show bit.

586
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:03,408
Speaker 0: I'm just I'd you you talk about this.

587
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:09,742
Speaker 0: if you never make any effort to go see normal people out there non geeks Because this is the kind of place doesn't isn't Scott?

588
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:14,517
Speaker 0: actually it is the the city of beacon and the people in it are really really really townie.

589
00:37:14,597 --> 00:37:25,420
Speaker 0: beacon has this huge Reputation in the whole county for being a really really townie and everyone knows each other and they all go to the festivals together And they all go to the pub crawls together and they all climb the mountain for fun all the time.

590
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:26,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't do that.

591
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,940
Speaker 0: You haven't gone to a single town festival and they happen regularly because I'm out of town on the weekend.

592
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:33,548
Speaker 0: Oh, no, you've been home for several.

593
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,680
Speaker 0: I've gone to some of them and you stayed home.

594
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:40,022
Speaker 1: Those aren't like real Scott.

595
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:44,157
Speaker 0: you realize that even the the the weekly farmers market half the town goes.

596
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:45,100
Speaker 0: is this huge thing?

597
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:53,950
Speaker 0: There's a crazy number of people and all these booths and crafts and music and everyone hanging out and having a grand old time Every single Sunday that happens.

598
00:37:54,432 --> 00:38:04,868
Speaker 1: you've never gone once Because I'm doing stuff like oh, oh, so what's the point of having the community if you would see you're not going to the Farmers market to be friendly with people.

599
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,500
Speaker 1: you're going to buy some farmers goods and come back.

600
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,753
Speaker 0: Yes, and the thing is that's because I know what I want and I get it.

601
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:13,673
Speaker 0: but you say you want something yet You don't put forth any effort to get it.

602
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:16,490
Speaker 1: I'm just saying is I like a place?

603
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,194
Speaker 1: that's like that.

604
00:38:17,555 --> 00:38:21,532
Speaker 0: This town is like it But it's not like on my street.

605
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:23,020
Speaker 1: it's all the way over there at the farmers.

606
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:35,311
Speaker 0: Well, that's just because you happen to live a couple blocks away from the center of town where everyone is I know but that's I'm saying is I want to live, you know You're saying you want to live a quarter mile further down the road.

607
00:38:35,452 --> 00:38:36,074
Speaker 1: That'll be nice.

608
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:38,080
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be any different.

609
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:38,823
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would.

610
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:42,537
Speaker 1: I don't see how you've never lived in a place like that.

611
00:38:42,578 --> 00:38:43,060
Speaker 1: So, what do you know?

612
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,370
Speaker 0: Berkshire was just like that and isn't it great?

613
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:47,916
Speaker 0: No, I was indifferent.

614
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:48,558
Speaker 0: I was a little kid.

615
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:49,722
Speaker 0: I didn't care You suck.

616
00:38:49,783 --> 00:38:55,204
Speaker 0: These were just all these adults trying to talk over the kids heads, even though the kids weren't stupid We all knew what they were saying.

617
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:57,472
Speaker 1: Anyway, let's do the show.

618
00:38:57,814 --> 00:38:59,380
Speaker 1: All right, how long do we spend on that?

619
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,846
Speaker 0: We pretty much did a whole show on that.

620
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:03,132
Speaker 1: Oh, that's no good.

621
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:04,979
Speaker 0: We can talk for about 10 minutes.

622
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:08,556
Speaker 1: They think our main bits gonna take more than 10 minutes.

623
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:09,442
Speaker 0: Not really I don't know.

624
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:10,510
Speaker 0: there's not so much to say.

625
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:12,560
Speaker 0: it's a very cut-and-dry issue All right.

626
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:19,020
Speaker 1: So a lot of people lately seem to be confused about this concept of burden of proof.

627
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:22,496
Speaker 0: Mostly people in our own forums, you know who you will know.

628
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:23,440
Speaker 0: you don't know who you are.

629
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,999
Speaker 1: Well, mostly people in the United States who do not understand science.

630
00:39:28,161 --> 00:39:30,148
Speaker 0: All right, let's before we get into it.

631
00:39:30,189 --> 00:39:33,240
Speaker 0: Let's do a couple examples and then we'll go from there.

632
00:39:33,561 --> 00:39:35,450
Speaker 0: I think we can illustrate the point very succinctly.

633
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,355
Speaker 1: All right, you ready?

634
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:36,918
Speaker 1: All right.

635
00:39:36,978 --> 00:39:41,691
Speaker 1: Hey rim Yeah, did you know that I'm actually the fifth resurrection of Hitler?

636
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:44,397
Speaker 0: fifth that can't be because I'm the sixth.

637
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,680
Speaker 1: Oh Well, see here's the perfect example.

638
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:51,978
Speaker 1: I have claimed that I am the fifth resurrection of Hitler.

639
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,772
Speaker 0: now This is a claim that is extraordinary.

640
00:39:55,952 --> 00:39:58,885
Speaker 1: now take as an alter even if it's an ordinary claim It doesn't matter.

641
00:39:58,925 --> 00:40:04,558
Speaker 0: but extraordinary claims are especially You know, well now let's take I got my own counterclaim.

642
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:08,509
Speaker 0: All right Today I had an Italian combo sandwich.

643
00:40:09,271 --> 00:40:10,734
Speaker 1: Oh, did you now?

644
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:11,957
Speaker 0: I'm actually lying.

645
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:18,640
Speaker 0: I had an Italian BMT Mm-hmm, but I said I have an Italian combo and My claim was an ordinary claim.

646
00:40:21,562 --> 00:40:33,671
Speaker 1: So the question is if I say that I'm the fifth resurrection of Hitler and you try to say no you're not How do I you know who has to prove?

647
00:40:33,852 --> 00:40:38,194
Speaker 1: can I just say well you can't prove I'm not the fifth resurrection of Hitler.

648
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:39,059
Speaker 1: Therefore I am.

649
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:46,755
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, I could say you can't prove I didn't eat an Italian BMT or an Italian combo Whichever one I said because I don't remember.

650
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:50,429
Speaker 1: now You said Italian combo you ate a BMT.

651
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,670
Speaker 0: Yes.

652
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:51,573
Speaker 0: I did eat a BMT.

653
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:53,559
Speaker 0: I remember now because I had pepperoni on it.

654
00:40:54,422 --> 00:41:00,325
Speaker 1: So the question is is it up to rim to prove that I'm not The fifth resurrection of Hitler?

655
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:04,597
Speaker 1: and if he doesn't if he fails to prove that I'm not I automatically am or is it?

656
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,891
Speaker 1: I have to prove that I am the fifth resurrection of Hitler.

657
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:11,039
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I'm not now.

658
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:17,840
Speaker 0: first Let's look at the ordinary claim because ordinary claims are very easy to solve and second ordinary claims rarely matter.

659
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:23,480
Speaker 0: Yep So I said that I ate the Italian combo when actually the truth is I ate the BMT.

660
00:41:24,383 --> 00:41:29,020
Speaker 0: But if I claim that I ate the Italian combo Scott doesn't need to prove.

661
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,859
Speaker 0: I mean he needs to prove me wrong.

662
00:41:31,362 --> 00:41:40,093
Speaker 0: I don't need to prove I'm right because one the matter is trivial and two it's a falsifiable claim Meaning it is possible to be proven wrong Mm-hmm.

663
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:50,983
Speaker 0: so if it became a matter of Scott had to prove me wrong because I Murdered some guy and my alibi is that I was eating the one instead of the other and if I ate the BMT then That means I'm the killer.

664
00:41:51,003 --> 00:41:55,878
Speaker 1: then Oh cheap cheap murder mysteries that are like two pages long.

665
00:41:55,958 --> 00:42:02,499
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Then if Scott the burden of proof is on Scott because he has to prove that I ate the BMT.

666
00:42:03,222 --> 00:42:04,505
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, I don't have to prove anything.

667
00:42:04,546 --> 00:42:06,211
Speaker 0: I made a normal ordinary credit claim.

668
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:09,199
Speaker 0: I mean if I say yeah, I saw a cloud today.

669
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,846
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah I'm pretty sure you saw cloud today.

670
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:26,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, an ordinary claim is a claim that doesn't put forth any sort of extra Baggage, it's hard to really put it succinctly without using, you know, stupid logical terms that half of you would try not care about.

671
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:46,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if my claim does not affect your worldview does not affect the world does not counter any Widely held reasonably accepted claims and does not go against accepted scientific theory There is no reason to doubt it and there is no reason for me to have to back it up Every time I say 2 plus 2 is 4.

672
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:47,994
Speaker 0: I don't have to prove that 2 plus 2 is 4.

673
00:42:47,994 --> 00:42:48,154
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

674
00:42:49,661 --> 00:42:51,427
Speaker 0: Now let's go to Scott's claim about Hitler.

675
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:54,719
Speaker 1: I I'm the fifth resurrection of Hitler now one.

676
00:42:55,723 --> 00:43:00,885
Speaker 0: If Scott's claim is true, then the following are also true Resurrection is possible.

677
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:02,349
Speaker 0: Hitler is back.

678
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,615
Speaker 0: Scott is the resurrection of Hitler.

679
00:43:04,635 --> 00:43:06,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm Jewish.

680
00:43:07,322 --> 00:43:10,932
Speaker 0: Now this this has all sorts of ramifications for the world.

681
00:43:10,972 --> 00:43:12,677
Speaker 0: it has all sorts of baggage.

682
00:43:12,997 --> 00:43:14,983
Speaker 0: it goes against Accepted theory.

683
00:43:15,003 --> 00:43:16,508
Speaker 0: it goes against accepted knowledge.

684
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,533
Speaker 0: It goes against accepted everything.

685
00:43:18,553 --> 00:43:20,840
Speaker 0: the burden of proof is on Scott.

686
00:43:21,343 --> 00:43:24,680
Speaker 0: I don't have to prove that he's not Hitler because that's just stupid.

687
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:31,060
Speaker 0: Scott has to prove that he's Hitler or his claim is effectively to be ignored by anyone who has a brain.

688
00:43:31,561 --> 00:43:35,573
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if it's basically what is it false by default?

689
00:43:35,934 --> 00:43:37,218
Speaker 1: or is it true by default?

690
00:43:37,379 --> 00:43:40,430
Speaker 1: and generally everything in the whole universe?

691
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:50,479
Speaker 1: any statement or claim you can make is Automatically, I don't know by default Technically speaking and then yeah, we're not gonna get into Gnosticism.

692
00:43:50,559 --> 00:44:11,920
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, but the point is when you say something even if it's a negative something like let's say I say that A red mushroom gives you an extra life in Mario 1 and rim says no a red mushroom does not Give you an extra life in Mario 1. those are both claims even though one of them is a negative claim.

693
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:17,435
Speaker 1: If you make a claim you have to provide evidence for your claim.

694
00:44:17,816 --> 00:44:21,005
Speaker 1: if you do not provide evidence Then you got nothing.

695
00:44:21,607 --> 00:44:31,420
Speaker 0: So if I say that I am actually an elf let's say mm-hmm Now I've got to prove that I'm actually an elf because that again has all this baggage and I'm the one making the claim.

696
00:44:31,842 --> 00:44:42,407
Speaker 0: I'm the one asserting that there's a truth in the world a truth that has far-reaching ramifications Yep, and therefore you must provide the evidence now Even if it doesn't have far-reaching ramifications.

697
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:50,028
Speaker 0: if it's an ordinary claim, let's say I say I am a man Or now to bed the same.

698
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:51,151
Speaker 0: it's the same argument.

699
00:44:51,312 --> 00:44:53,579
Speaker 0: I'm making a claim and I have to back it up.

700
00:44:54,100 --> 00:45:01,180
Speaker 0: However, because it's an ordinary claim my claim does not in any way impede or go against accepted knowledge.

701
00:45:01,943 --> 00:45:05,336
Speaker 1: I don't have to back it up because there's already so much evidence out there.

702
00:45:05,396 --> 00:45:06,280
Speaker 1: It's just already.

703
00:45:06,401 --> 00:45:09,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't matter if my claim is true or not.

704
00:45:09,381 --> 00:45:17,914
Speaker 0: So if you want to challenge my claim you can but I'm not forced by default to back it up because he's already got a Mountain of existing evidence, which is pretty obvious.

705
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:19,020
Speaker 1: It's obvious evidence.

706
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,449
Speaker 0: The key here is extraordinary claims.

707
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:24,120
Speaker 0: that the quote that says it best is very simply.

708
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,832
Speaker 0: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, right?

709
00:45:28,912 --> 00:45:35,273
Speaker 1: Let's say I make an extraordinary claim like I can fly without you know, I can fly.

710
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:36,759
Speaker 1: I like Superman, right?

711
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,942
Speaker 1: Now rim will come up and say you can't fly like Superman can't fly like ten Superman's and I'll say yes I can.

712
00:45:44,003 --> 00:45:46,939
Speaker 1: I'm just not doing it right now and I'm not gonna do it when anyone can see.

713
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:48,547
Speaker 1: You can't prove.

714
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:51,220
Speaker 1: you can't prove that I can't fly like Superman.

715
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:53,826
Speaker 1: Therefore I can fly like Superman.

716
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:56,354
Speaker 1: and well, it is possible that that could be true.

717
00:45:56,595 --> 00:45:58,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is indeed a possibility.

718
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:00,173
Speaker 1: However, you don't believe me.

719
00:46:00,596 --> 00:46:01,220
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

720
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:07,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I believe if I take Scott's claim without him providing evidence for it because it's an extraordinary claim.

721
00:46:08,078 --> 00:46:08,680
Speaker 0: I'm an idiot.

722
00:46:09,362 --> 00:46:14,055
Speaker 1: Yep, it's up to me with my crazy claim to provide evidence.

723
00:46:14,095 --> 00:46:22,120
Speaker 1: if I can't provide any evidence That's that proves and at least partially proves if not fully proves that I can indeed fly like Superman.

724
00:46:22,221 --> 00:46:28,290
Speaker 1: For example flying like Superman when someone can see Then I'm full of crap.

725
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:29,920
Speaker 1: and that's how it works.

726
00:46:30,342 --> 00:46:36,973
Speaker 1: So next time you argue with someone and they say you can't prove me wrong You say no, the burden of proof is on you.

727
00:46:37,134 --> 00:46:38,259
Speaker 1: You made a claim.

728
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:42,112
Speaker 1: Therefore you must provide evidence to support that claim.

729
00:46:42,252 --> 00:46:47,112
Speaker 1: if you cannot provide evidence to support your claim You are wrong by default.

730
00:46:47,273 --> 00:46:53,697
Speaker 1: if your claim is extraordinary Yeah, in fact the only day I don't you know, you don't need there's nothing can be proven wrong.

731
00:46:53,758 --> 00:46:56,693
Speaker 0: a hundred percent I mean, well, no things can be proven wrong.

732
00:46:56,753 --> 00:46:57,940
Speaker 0: It's a lot of things, right?

733
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:04,452
Speaker 0: Basically you prove you you make an assertion Especially in science and you test it and ivory test you do.

734
00:47:04,472 --> 00:47:05,515
Speaker 0: you've done a thousand tests.

735
00:47:05,896 --> 00:47:08,511
Speaker 0: all say yes This looks like it's true.

736
00:47:08,552 --> 00:47:09,559
Speaker 0: The evidence supports it.

737
00:47:09,983 --> 00:47:11,519
Speaker 0: You can't ever prove it a hundred percent.

738
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:16,660
Speaker 0: But you can prove it wrong because the moment you have a counterexample the whole thing is proven wrong.

739
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:18,893
Speaker 0: Oh, look, it didn't work because of that.

740
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:25,040
Speaker 1: There is crap It's true, but just because you know, let's say you didn't do those a thousand yes tests, right?

741
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,344
Speaker 1: You just did.

742
00:47:26,364 --> 00:47:28,754
Speaker 1: you know the one other test.

743
00:47:29,156 --> 00:47:29,980
Speaker 1: am I thinking this right?

744
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:31,443
Speaker 0: You know what?

745
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:32,105
Speaker 0: It's very.

746
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:33,532
Speaker 0: it's much simpler if we go with.

747
00:47:34,195 --> 00:47:37,018
Speaker 0: there are two kinds of arguments You want to really get into it over?

748
00:47:38,061 --> 00:47:43,219
Speaker 0: The nature of something as it is or the nature of something as we have defined it.

749
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:45,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we're.

750
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:52,888
Speaker 0: if we're talking about, you know, if I say this thing I'm holding up as a picture of food from samurai Champloo, I am indeed holding up a picture of food right now.

751
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:56,340
Speaker 0: and see it is now because we both agree on what food is.

752
00:47:56,822 --> 00:48:00,720
Speaker 0: I can make the claim that this is food and it can be proven a hundred percent by evidence.

753
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:07,796
Speaker 0: Yep But natural world things can't be proven a hundred percent Because we don't have an objective viewpoint and we didn't make up the rules.

754
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:11,340
Speaker 0: Yep But that that's a whole topic for another day.

755
00:48:11,382 --> 00:48:22,232
Speaker 1: Yes So if I say I have magic powers and I say you can't prove I don't have magic powers And you can't because you can't prove I don't have magic powers.

756
00:48:22,292 --> 00:48:22,974
Speaker 1: It's not possible.

757
00:48:23,035 --> 00:48:24,540
Speaker 1: That doesn't mean I have magic powers.

758
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:29,341
Speaker 1: It means that I have to prove I have magic powers or else I don't.

759
00:48:29,843 --> 00:48:33,838
Speaker 0: the burden of proof is always on the person making the claim.

760
00:48:33,858 --> 00:48:40,120
Speaker 1: now Let's say I'm standing here and I you know just standing and rim comes up and says you don't have magic powers.

761
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:41,265
Speaker 1: And that's his claim.

762
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:41,748
Speaker 0: Yes.

763
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:42,914
Speaker 0: I've still made a claim.

764
00:48:42,974 --> 00:48:46,087
Speaker 0: I've made a negative claim I've stepped forth and made an assertion.

765
00:48:46,248 --> 00:48:49,280
Speaker 1: then he has to you know, then his claim requires evidence.

766
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,633
Speaker 1: I'm like do you have any evidence that I don't have magic powers?

767
00:48:51,653 --> 00:48:52,740
Speaker 1: because I'm not saying I do.

768
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:53,787
Speaker 1: He's just saying I don't.

769
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,460
Speaker 0: and of course then I can try it.

770
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,405
Speaker 0: I can try to force Scott to do all these magic tricks and he fails at all of them and I try to make him fly He can't and all these things.

771
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:08,839
Speaker 0: then I've effectively brought forth more and more evidence that my claim is in fact true and Like say it say in science.

772
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:09,883
Speaker 0: now We talk about evolution.

773
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:12,691
Speaker 0: people make the claim that evolution is happening.

774
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:18,870
Speaker 0: evolution has happened and we've studied it and studied it and we keep making Evidences like well, what about this situation?

775
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,392
Speaker 0: Hey, it works.

776
00:49:19,573 --> 00:49:20,396
Speaker 0: What about this evidence?

777
00:49:20,617 --> 00:49:21,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, it fits.

778
00:49:21,381 --> 00:49:26,280
Speaker 0: We're getting closer and closer to saying you know what it's very likely to be true when there's no reason to say it's not true.

779
00:49:26,481 --> 00:49:30,194
Speaker 1: Yes, you make a claim and the claim is backed up by evidence.

780
00:49:30,495 --> 00:49:31,720
Speaker 1: you make a negative claim.

781
00:49:32,121 --> 00:49:33,745
Speaker 1: The claim is backed up by evidence.

782
00:49:34,126 --> 00:49:42,795
Speaker 0: an extraordinary claim is one by which there for which there is not any Extant evidence or at least any known extent evidence as ghosts.

783
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:43,860
Speaker 1: The Ghostbusters are real.

784
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, saying evolution happened is not an extraordinary claim.

785
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:53,260
Speaker 0: There are mountains of science backing that up saying that the Markian evolution happened.

786
00:49:53,822 --> 00:49:56,880
Speaker 1: There's mountains of evidence against the Markian evolution.

787
00:49:57,001 --> 00:50:06,620
Speaker 0: So if I want if I if ice claim that Lamar can evolution happened I better provide some crazy freakin evidence to back that up because there's already all this evidence saying it isn't true.

788
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:09,789
Speaker 0: So it would require crazy extraordinary evidence.

789
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:13,460
Speaker 0: Yes, which I probably can't provide because Lamar can evolution probably didn't happen.

790
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,880
Speaker 1: So just because you have a claim that cannot be proven wrong doesn't make it true.

791
00:50:19,362 --> 00:50:31,554
Speaker 1: nothing is true unless it has evidence behind it and extraordinary things that are crazy and not normal require Incredible amounts of evidence because they're so crazy if it's a normal everyday thing.

792
00:50:31,574 --> 00:50:33,380
Speaker 1: You don't need so much evidence because it's not crazy.

793
00:50:34,421 --> 00:50:35,246
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

794
00:50:35,527 --> 00:50:41,174
Speaker 1: So next time if someone says something crazy If they you know, and then they say you can't prove it wrong.

795
00:50:41,215 --> 00:50:42,480
Speaker 1: Well, of course, you can't prove it wrong.

796
00:50:42,721 --> 00:50:44,269
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things you can't prove wrong.

797
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:45,395
Speaker 1: You can't prove that.

798
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:46,260
Speaker 1: I'm not God.

799
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,653
Speaker 1: You can't prove that rim doesn't have magic powers.

800
00:50:49,673 --> 00:50:51,600
Speaker 1: You can't prove that I totally have magic power.

801
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,363
Speaker 0: You can't prove that.

802
00:50:52,443 --> 00:50:55,094
Speaker 1: fairies, you know don't exist you can't.

803
00:50:55,435 --> 00:51:06,214
Speaker 0: you know, there's a lot of things You can't disprove that are all false because it's really hard to do things now And just to head off any people who might disagree with that bit right there.

804
00:51:06,676 --> 00:51:09,730
Speaker 0: We're talking about Pedantic and semantic arguments.

805
00:51:10,051 --> 00:51:11,880
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm the real I mean the real world is false.

806
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,186
Speaker 0: You can't ever prove anything.

807
00:51:13,226 --> 00:51:18,889
Speaker 0: a hundred percent due to a lot of very complicated Philosophical and scientific ideas.

808
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,960
Speaker 0: Yes, which we'll get into on another day.

809
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:23,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I know we've already gone long.

810
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we did two shows about how.

811
00:51:25,997 --> 00:51:26,740
Speaker 1: I don't think of it.

812
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,780
Speaker 1: Hey, I think it was the thing today about a kid on roller skates.

813
00:51:29,981 --> 00:51:30,382
Speaker 1: You know what?

814
00:51:30,663 --> 00:51:34,916
Speaker 0: We almost went into the similar thing about the marriage the household thing.

815
00:51:34,936 --> 00:51:36,080
Speaker 0: We just cut it short on purpose.

816
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:38,174
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could have done three episodes tonight.

817
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:39,767
Speaker 0: Uh That's fine.

818
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:40,393
Speaker 0: It's Thursday.

819
00:51:40,413 --> 00:51:45,256
Speaker 0: All right Once again, I'd like to say that we are going to uber con this weekend.

820
00:51:45,376 --> 00:51:46,160
Speaker 0: on Saturday.

821
00:51:46,782 --> 00:51:48,226
Speaker 0: We are at least I am a guest.

822
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:49,189
Speaker 0: Scott will be there.

823
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:51,196
Speaker 1: yeah, we'll see how this turns out.

824
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:52,460
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have words.

825
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:54,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll be fun.

826
00:51:54,689 --> 00:51:56,117
Speaker 0: I think uber con will be a fun time.

827
00:51:56,197 --> 00:52:00,020
Speaker 1: as always I just show up and be like, hey you sent him a one you didn't send me one.

828
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:04,000
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I would have gone to uber con even if they didn't want us to do a panel.

829
00:52:04,181 --> 00:52:05,809
Speaker 1: I also would we weren't getting in free.

830
00:52:06,131 --> 00:52:07,800
Speaker 0: So it's not a big deal at all.

831
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,251
Speaker 1: I'll just say something and if they go and no, I'll be like, alright fine.

832
00:52:11,272 --> 00:52:11,593
Speaker 1: I'll pay.

833
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,820
Speaker 1: Yep, but I'll still I'll say something.

834
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:16,173
Speaker 0: I think we're really gonna bust out at the next uber con.

835
00:52:16,193 --> 00:52:17,360
Speaker 0: I think we're gonna go the whole weekend.

836
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,087
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe want to see.

837
00:52:19,147 --> 00:52:19,850
Speaker 0: I really want to.

838
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:25,439
Speaker 0: yeah, it depends depends on a lot of things And also a lot of people in our forums have noticed that.

839
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:29,099
Speaker 0: well They were talking about the dice jewelry that our friend Nury was making.

840
00:52:29,584 --> 00:52:30,900
Speaker 0: Oh, there was talked about a while ago.

841
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:41,380
Speaker 0: The thread disappeared somewhat recently because people people in our forums are very fickle and a thread Will flash and get like 40 posts and then suddenly everyone forgets about it and it disappears.

842
00:52:41,942 --> 00:52:43,890
Speaker 0: Sorrow well sinks to the second page.

843
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,035
Speaker 1: what a neglected thread.

844
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:46,100
Speaker 0: where dragons sit.

845
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:50,499
Speaker 0: Dragons be there there be dragons on the second page of the forums there be.

846
00:52:51,523 --> 00:53:01,967
Speaker 0: But she now has her website up and you can buy custom and semi custom and not custom Dice earrings as in Dungeons & Dragons.

847
00:53:02,008 --> 00:53:06,680
Speaker 0: dice and dice jewelry that are really kind of cool and this isn't an advertisement or anything.

848
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,140
Speaker 0: It's actually really cool and she's a good friend of ours.

849
00:53:09,642 --> 00:53:10,907
Speaker 1: So many sided dice.

850
00:53:11,028 --> 00:53:14,904
Speaker 1: more than six sides sometimes less than six sides I mean one.

851
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:21,834
Speaker 0: Scott John from her got this giant d30 Hanging on a chain that he wears around.

852
00:53:21,854 --> 00:53:25,827
Speaker 0: It's kind of gaudy You know But it's gaudy in an awesome 70s way.

853
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:32,570
Speaker 0: imagine him at a nightclub with a polyester suit and is a big You know big collared shirt with the top.

854
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,520
Speaker 1: That's exactly the kind of gaudy it is.

855
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:38,100
Speaker 0: Yeah with the with the chest hair hanging out of the giant d30 hanging there.

856
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:41,896
Speaker 0: That is an awesome aesthetic for that kind of thing.

857
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:46,766
Speaker 1: it is D&D was made in the 70s.

858
00:53:46,826 --> 00:53:47,749
Speaker 0: So yeah.

859
00:53:47,889 --> 00:53:50,598
Speaker 0: Yeah plus I got to say I really like disco.

860
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:55,585
Speaker 0: Yeah I'll say straight up that I like disco and You know what?

861
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:59,695
Speaker 0: I'm making a claim disco is awesome and I have extraordinary evidence.

862
00:54:00,055 --> 00:54:01,940
