1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,971
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, November 3rd, 2021.

2
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:11,472
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:14,019
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nice.

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,180
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about the manga jujutsu kaisen.

5
00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:20,897
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:39,738
Speaker 1: So, uh in my continued exciting life of biking to and from work on city bikes as it's gotten colder so far There are no more city bikes than there were before like they run out at the same rate now that they did a month ago Despite the fact that it was 48 degrees when I didn't mean to work.

7
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:41,466
Speaker 0: Well 48 Fahrenheit.

8
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:42,169
Speaker 0: It's not that cool.

9
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:48,720
Speaker 1: You know, I mean it's cold for me, but I mean in the grand scheme It's not that I was a little chilly cuz I don't wear a coat Like I was just wearing my normal like work clothes.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,292
Speaker 1: I think I gotta get a biking coat out at this point.

11
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:55,448
Speaker 0: if you look at Number historical city bike numbers.

12
00:00:55,508 --> 00:00:58,840
Speaker 0: It's like they go down when it's cold, but they don't go down that much.

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,000
Speaker 1: Well, in fact, did we use this as the thing of the day to we just talk about it?

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,894
Speaker 1: I think we just talked about it.

15
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:20,734
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's a. there's a video that got into a lot of research and the conclusion of this research across multiple studies was that The weather in a place has zero impact on the rate of people commuting to work via bike Using bikes in summer winter different seasons or anything.

16
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:28,720
Speaker 1: the sole Correlation between people biking or not biking is if the place is more car friendly or more bike friendly full stop.

17
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:39,091
Speaker 1: So in like parts of London people bike everywhere even in the snow because there's bike lanes and then in place I mean, it's just no one bikes because Canada doesn't support bikes for shit.

18
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:42,503
Speaker 0: I mean, it's just it's just a matter of you know Attitude, right?

19
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:44,894
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you look at you know people in Netherlands.

20
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:46,280
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, oh, it's raining.

21
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,215
Speaker 0: I'll put on a big piece of plastic and I'll go bike right.

22
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:54,852
Speaker 1: so that European umbrella I use the weird one that I imported that I like and I talk about a lot.

23
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:56,818
Speaker 1: get this it actually has.

24
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:59,679
Speaker 1: I never bought This because this is a product aimed at Europeans.

25
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:08,479
Speaker 1: It is a mount so you can stick it on the front of your bike and because it's so aerodynamic You can bike up to 20 miles an hour without it having a problem.

26
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:12,700
Speaker 0: And if you also have a necessary when you could just buy, you know, the cloak thingy.

27
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,229
Speaker 0: That depends this.

28
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:28,251
Speaker 1: I say I saw videos of it And if you're the kind of person who's biking around a city in Europe where you're biking real slow on a real slow bike Like the same kind of bike you'd have like a coffee cup holder on And you have fenders and all that stuff.

29
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,860
Speaker 1: It looks like it works really well.

30
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:31,608
Speaker 0: The brand.

31
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:32,073
Speaker 0: Oh, that's right.

32
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:32,699
Speaker 0: That's the brand.

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,884
Speaker 0: so if you're looking for if you want to bike in the rain and not get wet and you're not like Biking fast.

34
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:40,547
Speaker 0: Yes bike.

35
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:41,391
Speaker 1: Yeah, biking fast.

36
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,362
Speaker 1: Just embrace wetness at that point Right.

37
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:44,845
Speaker 0: the.

38
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,800
Speaker 0: the brand that I have heard good things about is clever hood.

39
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:51,158
Speaker 0: So I've seen them around and they look pretty cool.

40
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,164
Speaker 0: actually You know, I should.

41
00:02:53,265 --> 00:03:01,129
Speaker 1: I should think I should actually maybe think about getting something cuz I now that now that there's really no reason To have an unlimited metro card anymore in New York.

42
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,740
Speaker 1: I just pay every time I ride the subway.

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,804
Speaker 1: You don't ride it that often.

44
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:09,159
Speaker 1: So maybe I'll just like double down on biking even more than I do now.

45
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:15,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, somebody I remember though that reminds me I can't find it's it's one of those things where it's like one tweet.

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:24,072
Speaker 0: it would be impossible to find again because Twitter search is so awful, right, but Somebody tweeted and they showed like an American children's school book.

47
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:28,964
Speaker 0: That was like, oh it's raining, you know Let's not go outside Right.

48
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:38,254
Speaker 1: Oh, it's you know, let's you know, but it's such an attitude That has bothered me my whole life that people will just like Avoid getting wet unless they have a good reason not to like.

49
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:44,300
Speaker 1: if you're wearing fancy clothes Yeah, like you want to avoid getting wet, but if I'm walking to work and it suddenly pours who cares?

50
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,190
Speaker 0: I'll just be wet like fine, but that but they.

51
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:47,531
Speaker 0: the.

52
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:57,206
Speaker 0: the children's book from you know The in Northern Europe was like Oh biking in the rain an adventure Like a different attitude.

53
00:03:57,226 --> 00:04:00,760
Speaker 1: I just imagined the one from Eastern Europe is like goblins will eat you.

54
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:07,600
Speaker 1: So anyway, I Once again have a minor city bike adventure.

55
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:14,480
Speaker 1: So I got a city bike in the middle of the day to go pick up my new glasses Bike over get the glasses bike back and there happened to be one e-bike.

56
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,769
Speaker 1: So I took it because it cost like 80 cents to use.

57
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,577
Speaker 0: that thing was a bat was the battery did.

58
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,884
Speaker 1: nope Totally fine.

59
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:20,909
Speaker 1: It was so.

60
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:29,088
Speaker 1: if you use those e-bikes often enough in New York The thing is about a third of them just don't work and you have to put them right back in the dock because you can't Bike that thing it weighs.

61
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:31,322
Speaker 0: I've never even tried to take the e-bike I don't know.

62
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:36,404
Speaker 1: real they're real good when they work but about a third of them just don't work and you just have to Pay extra.

63
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:40,800
Speaker 1: yeah, it's like four cents a minute and the first ten minutes are free or something.

64
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,704
Speaker 1: It's like almost nothing.

65
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:48,540
Speaker 1: It's zero cents a minute if I take the regular one and use my leg Yep, but if I don't want to get sweaty and I'm trying to get to work, it's so cheap.

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,433
Speaker 0: It's cheaper than the subway and faster than the other way, you know Another way to not get sweaty is don't pedal so hard.

67
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:54,835
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

68
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:55,799
Speaker 1: No, it's never gonna happen.

69
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,620
Speaker 1: Just chill plus if I pedal slow enough to not work up a sweat.

70
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:06,684
Speaker 1: The seven train is faster than a city bike, but an e-bike or my real body in a hurry I'm always in her.

71
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:07,146
Speaker 1: I always Lee.

72
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,195
Speaker 1: I if I need to be at work in 15 minutes.

73
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:10,038
Speaker 1: I leave with 13 minutes.

74
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,900
Speaker 0: I'm just enjoying going on my bike.

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,687
Speaker 1: I all I buy.

76
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,840
Speaker 0: why would I be in a hurry when I could bike more?

77
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,337
Speaker 1: No, I'll just I'll be in a hurry.

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,933
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I get on this thing.

79
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:23,659
Speaker 1: it's working fine.

80
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:31,309
Speaker 1: I'm biking like to the optic like the optics place in Kips Bay and I'm using only the front brake because really you only need A front brake on a bike.

81
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:32,400
Speaker 1: It's the better brake.

82
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,820
Speaker 1: We've talked about this before people who don't know how to use bike brakes.

83
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,618
Speaker 1: When I was turning a corner onto like Second Avenue I used work.

84
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,999
Speaker 1: No, I used the rear brake because I was turning and I just wanted to slow down because there's a bunch of traffic and shit.

85
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,734
Speaker 1: the rear brake screeched.

86
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:52,760
Speaker 1: now That happens like even a nice bike will like screech if it's a little wet or something.

87
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:57,918
Speaker 1: It was so loud the cars around me all like stopped.

88
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:02,250
Speaker 1: suddenly Everyone on the street like stopped and turned to look.

89
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:05,680
Speaker 1: a cop like started looking around like what's going on.

90
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:10,880
Speaker 1: It was so loud that it stopped traffic and people on Second Avenue.

91
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:19,289
Speaker 1: All right, and I was like what the fuck and I'm like, I just like I yell like sorry This city bike sucks shit and everyone starts laughing.

92
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:21,857
Speaker 1: and then I bike further and just to test I try it again.

93
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:22,900
Speaker 1: It's even louder.

94
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,411
Speaker 1: Okay, it hurt my ears.

95
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,660
Speaker 1: my ears were literally ringing.

96
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:30,593
Speaker 1: So I parked it and I reported it broken and I was like.

97
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,900
Speaker 1: it is dangerously loud if you use the rear brake.

98
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,175
Speaker 1: I don't know how this even happened.

99
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:36,823
Speaker 1: That's my story.

100
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:41,880
Speaker 1: that's the most exciting thing that's happened to me since Tuesday when I realized the next morning the episode didn't actually post.

101
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:47,899
Speaker 1: No It's on patreon, but it's still not on the Ignites website until Scott fixes it.

102
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:52,809
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I had to do something like that, yep No rush because it's it's the patreon.

103
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,498
Speaker 1: people all got it and no one complained yet.

104
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:58,833
Speaker 1: So Great, but yeah, there's some news.

105
00:06:58,933 --> 00:06:59,877
Speaker 1: I think the biggest news.

106
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:01,244
Speaker 1: there's a lot of news We could talk about.

107
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:04,100
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna say anything more about that cowboy bebop live-action.

108
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,813
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see it and then we'll just review it at this point.

109
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:16,920
Speaker 1: but in comic world The workers of image comics announced on November 1st two days ago that they have unionized.

110
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:20,020
Speaker 1: That is a big goddamn deal.

111
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:21,126
Speaker 0: So does that?

112
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,560
Speaker 0: so all the different comic publishers?

113
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,674
Speaker 0: right have different ways that they manage the Creators of the comics the writers artists colors inkers.

114
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:46,820
Speaker 0: Yeah and such right With like, you know in terms of like you make one-off deals you do contracts you do They're permanent, you know exclusive employees And some of them do this in combination.

115
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:59,140
Speaker 1: There's the way labor organizes like practically and theoretically is really complex and a lot of people especially tech bros Don't really appreciate the complexity of this space

116
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:06,380
Speaker 0: And I sort of forget all the different ways the different comic companies do it and they all have histories of good and or bad.

117
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:08,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's going on there, right?

118
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:11,960
Speaker 0: And Some of them, you know wax and wane, right?

119
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:22,881
Speaker 0: you'll see some like a company being really popular with creators and then doing someone dirty and then becoming really unpopular with creators and like Creators, you know artists writers know to stay away from that company Cuz.

120
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:27,380
Speaker 1: then you get the companies like the Tokyo pop era and like the obvious exactly.

121
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:34,227
Speaker 0: I wanted to stay away from right but you cannot you can usually tell because you look at the company and you can see Over time right?

122
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:40,232
Speaker 0: It's like oh in the in this year to this year Look at all those books that company published from all these great creators.

123
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:42,720
Speaker 0: and then why do they publish now like nothing?

124
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:50,480
Speaker 0: It's because they've done someone, you know They did something dirty and everyone left and knew to stay away from even case in point in the video game world.

125
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:51,595
Speaker 1: We'll talk about this next Tuesday.

126
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:58,660
Speaker 1: show Blizzard, you know We talked about them a bunch all the sexual harassment and nonsense that happens there as happens in every triple-a studio.

127
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:09,419
Speaker 1: But not only did they fire a ton of people which was the right thing to do But all the people who didn't seem to be bad and we're just good game designers have also quit during all of this.

128
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,707
Speaker 1: now a Bunch of their games are delayed and like.

129
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:15,119
Speaker 1: it's not clear if they'll even be able to keep making good games at this point.

130
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:16,464
Speaker 0: We'll see.

131
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:18,551
Speaker 0: But anyway, so this image union, right?

132
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:28,700
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if it includes Everyone right because usually the writers of an image comic aren't gonna be an employee of image comics, right?

133
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,666
Speaker 0: But the editors at image comics might be

134
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:33,315
Speaker 1: yeah, and I haven't read every people

135
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:46,995
Speaker 0: working on printing and Marketing and also, you know a lot they do have a lot of employees that are permanent full-time, you know, or even part-time Employees of image comics directly, but most of the people who are writing and drawing the books.

136
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:49,503
Speaker 0: I don't believe are Employees.

137
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:52,012
Speaker 0: Oh, here's what I can know if they are part of the year's.

138
00:09:52,032 --> 00:09:54,060
Speaker 1: what I can say now about what this union is?

139
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,269
Speaker 1: It is what is a larger union than normal.

140
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,740
Speaker 1: It is called the comic book workers United.

141
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:06,960
Speaker 1: But I'll actually read the statement they gave quote for years comics publishing have watched our professional efforts support creators and delight readers.

142
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:12,780
Speaker 1: Sadly, we have also watched the same labor be taken for granted at best and exploited at worse.

143
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:20,432
Speaker 1: Keeping our heads above water was the new normal before the pandemic and since it's on set We've been expected to take on even larger workloads with fewer resources.

144
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:21,576
Speaker 0: That's everybody.

145
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:22,560
Speaker 0: That's not just comic.

146
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:23,503
Speaker 1: That is literally.

147
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:35,255
Speaker 1: I mean I all laborers eyes it aside if any of you are a Product manager like literally like my level of seniority We're hiring like I'm hiring people to work next to me as a peer.

148
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,520
Speaker 1: We're hiring engineers.

149
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:40,280
Speaker 1: We're hiring fucking everything right now, and we can't fill these positions.

150
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:48,380
Speaker 0: There's definitely, you know the same amount of work to be done in businesses that haven't failed and less people doing that work.

151
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:59,707
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it's a thing Yeah everywhere and it also talks about how contract employees are particularly vulnerable and exploited in the comics industry Specifically extremely.

152
00:10:59,767 --> 00:10:59,968
Speaker 0: Yeah.

153
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:02,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, almost everyone in the comic industry is on some kind of contract deal.

154
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,859
Speaker 0: There's very few full-time employees situations only like, you know editors-in-chief and that sort of thing, you know.

155
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:32,940
Speaker 1: Yep, so I'll link to their official statement and a gizmodo article that goes into a lot of details But I say I encourage you to just read about this and understand exactly what this union is doing especially if you work in this industry because this is the time to Like work in solidarity with another group that is already Unionized to either make a bigger union or make a union structured.

156
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:37,120
Speaker 1: Similarly, there's like this is the moment if you work in this industry.

157
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:47,280
Speaker 0: Now the only thing about this particular case here of comic book industry in the United States Think might be an issue is that you look at these other unions we've been seeing right Yahtzee.

158
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:51,380
Speaker 0: It's like they're working on movies that have huge budgets and make a fortune.

159
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:53,550
Speaker 1: Comics don't really make that much money.

160
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,680
Speaker 0: right and fair, you know video game people, right?

161
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,974
Speaker 0: It's like there is you know blizzard or whatever right or any of these places there is.

162
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:14,460
Speaker 0: there are people at the top Right who are fucking loaded and this high, you know margins Somebody's ranking in the bank and the Union is just gonna you know Hopefully be able to take some of that money out from the top and distribute it down.

163
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:30,251
Speaker 1: but there are industries where there is not enough money and The entire industry disappears, I don't know if image comics can sustain not Exploiting the labor.

164
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:46,401
Speaker 0: Yep, while also having the same quantity and quality of work and Also not jacking up the price of comic books to ridiculous heights that almost no one would buy them though arguably the sort of a Catch-22.

165
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:56,682
Speaker 0: the price is like this product can only exist at an affordable price even forgetting inflation even without the Exploitation.

166
00:12:56,702 --> 00:12:57,946
Speaker 1: Well, there's a few things.

167
00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:01,717
Speaker 0: Well image comics just go like just go under like what's gonna happen?

168
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:10,163
Speaker 1: on one hand entertainment is Extremely cheap compared to the cost of creating entertainment Global.

169
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,909
Speaker 0: and is the problem with just comics?

170
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,936
Speaker 0: fundamentally and video games?

171
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:20,500
Speaker 0: you create movies Right, but but the difference is that if you create a video game, it creates an enormous amount of labor.

172
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:22,206
Speaker 0: It sells at a low price.

173
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:23,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it sell.

174
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:27,953
Speaker 0: if you you got a hundred years of selling this thing You sell so many copies.

175
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:33,939
Speaker 0: it sells forever It doesn't go away and you can also do gambling and other nonsense to bring in more money.

176
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:42,944
Speaker 0: with a comic book, you know to create even just a normal floppy 30 page color comic book is a Very large effort.

177
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:47,460
Speaker 0: it could take, you know, the artist all fucking months and people are willing to pay one a couple bucks for it.

178
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,665
Speaker 1: They read it in five minutes.

179
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:49,489
Speaker 1: They write away.

180
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,719
Speaker 0: They pay three dollars for it, right?

181
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,427
Speaker 0: As soon as it's a week old It's not worth the three bucks anymore.

182
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:07,165
Speaker 0: and it's like unless it was a seek some significant Incredible comic, you know, it's like, okay, maybe it'll sell again in trades digitally a little bit or

183
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:12,685
Speaker 1: like an option for a movie but even then that not a lot of money goes to the creators of Those comics when that happens

184
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:16,160
Speaker 0: and the quantity of them that's available is so high.

185
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,320
Speaker 0: So even really fucking good ones are just like, you know lost to time.

186
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:38,249
Speaker 0: basically, and even if one's a hit the market size the pie of Comic book readers in the United States who read, you know comic books that are made by people in English Originally, yeah is not that large to begin with.

187
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:45,387
Speaker 0: so even some comic book that gets a large portion of that pie for a week It's like, you know, this.

188
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:50,240
Speaker 0: was there even enough revenue to pay the creators alone for getting all the other people involved?

189
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:52,719
Speaker 0: You know a decent wage for the month.

190
00:14:54,083 --> 00:15:06,100
Speaker 1: so yep, so like We should be feel like a cop like a video game should cost Hundreds of dollars if we actually took into account inflation and labor and everything else comics in the same way.

191
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,788
Speaker 1: So we're gonna be in a situation.

192
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:09,214
Speaker 0: just do the simple math, right?

193
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:13,167
Speaker 0: It's like you want someone to make 70k a year median income.

194
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:14,853
Speaker 0: Yeah divide that by 12.

195
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:16,439
Speaker 0: Let me get my calculator.

196
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:17,082
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

197
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:18,209
Speaker 1: Well you do that.

198
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:19,296
Speaker 1: what I'll say is what connect?

199
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:19,698
Speaker 1: what's gonna?

200
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:19,960
Speaker 0: okay?

201
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,568
Speaker 0: So you need to make for the one person.

202
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,100
Speaker 0: you need to get about six thousand dollars, right?

203
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,824
Speaker 0: Yeah, so a month.

204
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,692
Speaker 0: so you've got how many people working on the comic book?

205
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:33,900
Speaker 0: you at least have writer artist color or letter.

206
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:35,061
Speaker 0: That's for $18,000.

207
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:44,260
Speaker 0: right for just those four people We're not talking about you know, the people at the print shop the people right because they're working on multiple books.

208
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:45,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know editor, I guess.

209
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:47,551
Speaker 0: so six people right?

210
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:50,099
Speaker 1: What about all the material costs printing?

211
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,910
Speaker 0: Yeah Exactly exactly Right, but so they're talking.

212
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:55,733
Speaker 0: Oh great now.

213
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:56,797
Speaker 1: So Amazon takes a cut.

214
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:57,399
Speaker 1: that doesn't help.

215
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:10,113
Speaker 0: yep, you need to sell tens of thousands of copies of your comic book and Give all of the revenue all of it to the creators to be able to make that.

216
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:15,205
Speaker 0: and now you still got the comic book Shops taking a cut.

217
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,333
Speaker 0: You've got the distributors taking a cut.

218
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,100
Speaker 0: You got the distributor giving out discounts.

219
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:24,354
Speaker 0: You've got the bosses at the comic company taking a cut, you know You might have licensing deals.

220
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:31,822
Speaker 0: like you know My Little Pony comic Transformers comic this licensing to fees to pay right for whatever the deal was Right.

221
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,314
Speaker 0: all this money's taken out of the three dollars.

222
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:35,419
Speaker 0: They're charging or whatever.

223
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:35,801
Speaker 0: but

224
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:54,300
Speaker 1: all of this combined me on this book is that if we truly want a labor movement that forces living wages for things a lot of things a lot of industries are literally going to go under and that is just Because those industries could not exist safely fairly or equitably under our current economic system.

225
00:16:54,741 --> 00:17:01,860
Speaker 0: So and if you you know, and even if you start you manage to kick-start the cycle of higher wages higher prices, right?

226
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,659
Speaker 0: So, okay people are getting paid more.

227
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:10,240
Speaker 0: You know things cost more but hopefully the only things that cost more are things like comic books and not things like food.

228
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:16,362
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you can get wages up keep the food price normal and you know It's okay.

229
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:21,619
Speaker 0: if the prices of luxury goods go up because the higher wage is everyone can live.

230
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,468
Speaker 0: Well, because the necessities are a good price.

231
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:28,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then yeah luxury goods are expensive there, you know, they're luxury goods.

232
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,151
Speaker 1: Well case in part, we always talk to Australia as an example.

233
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:32,940
Speaker 1: They have a very high minimum wage.

234
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:37,780
Speaker 1: Everything's really expensive except food unless that food is imported.

235
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:52,180
Speaker 1: so people have a pretty high average quality of life and Also, they can still afford things but they can't afford like Imported luxury IP goods like a my little pony backpack will cost them like a hundred bucks.

236
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:58,180
Speaker 1: So they can't buy as much crap like that, but food costs about what it costs here just in Australian dollars.

237
00:17:58,341 --> 00:18:01,900
Speaker 1: So it ends up being much better for the average person, right?

238
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,520
Speaker 0: But I think that's the situation in which you know, you have to get even if you get to that situation.

239
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:11,053
Speaker 0: Right, you know, there isn't an Australian comic books.

240
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:16,820
Speaker 0: There are Australian comic creators for sure Yeah, but there isn't an Australian comics publishing industry.

241
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,755
Speaker 0: That's big but like a machine the way the Japanese or French.

242
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:35,920
Speaker 1: if the Japanese European and American comics industries contracted massively due to a labor movement that would open up the global stage for More global comic production with less competition from these heavily subsidized by human misery companies.

243
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:37,625
Speaker 0: There I think it just makes.

244
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:46,740
Speaker 0: I think it just makes life better for the people who are making purely digital comics because all You you've so many you only have the craters to make money, right?

245
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,556
Speaker 0: You don't have to worry about all those other people there, you know, yeah

246
00:18:51,007 --> 00:19:07,080
Speaker 1: but in the short term Irrespective of the like broader meta consequences of organizing like that you as a worker should absolutely organize because whatever happens later Has to start with us Actually putting pressure on these companies and putting pressure on our broken capitalist system.

247
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:11,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if you destroy if you know, it's like if you're at a job where you're being exploited.

248
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,708
Speaker 0: Right, your choices are continued to be exploited.

249
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:21,093
Speaker 0: make a union and maybe you can not be exploited and keep your job Which would be I guess the best situation.

250
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:24,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, or You start the union and you destroy your company.

251
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:26,295
Speaker 0: It's like well at that point.

252
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:33,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Being exploited at this point go get a non exploit II job someplace else I guess.

253
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:39,399
Speaker 0: But you know, it's like some people could see that as worse than being exploited because now you have nothing.

254
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:41,103
Speaker 1: Yeah, but

255
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:42,387
Speaker 0: that worse right

256
00:19:42,487 --> 00:20:03,640
Speaker 1: also means that if like this is what leads up to critical moments in like labor policies large enough strikes force government or private equity action That's the whole point of direct action like a general strike is the Surest way to force a government to make drastic changes, even if the people in that government do not want to make those changes.

257
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:17,160
Speaker 1: Yeah But it's very hard to get a general strike because if not everyone is on board if the strike is not big enough the people Who scab come out on top in the end or they replace the people who are trying to fight for better wages.

258
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:24,500
Speaker 1: Wages actually drop even lower more workers are exploited more and the individuals who tried to organize are just left out of the economy forever.

259
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:29,820
Speaker 0: I mean you also might just end up causing yourself a lot of pain and misery for nothing.

260
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,737
Speaker 0: Right, if you look in New York strikes don't work.

261
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:37,783
Speaker 0: The cabbies are on a hunger strike down there to try to get the medallion loans Fits up right.

262
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:43,179
Speaker 1: normal people who are still down there not eating because the government doesn't care and people who?

263
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:47,458
Speaker 1: Use cars a lot also don't care because they all just use uber or something.

264
00:20:49,101 --> 00:20:52,857
Speaker 1: Nor they even know that this is happening because they don't read the news or like talk to people.

265
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,557
Speaker 0: So Anyway, and some other like if I don't understand like, you know, how cold is the mayor right?

266
00:20:58,637 --> 00:20:59,300
Speaker 0: if I was mayor?

267
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:01,170
Speaker 0: I'd be like, please don't die.

268
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,457
Speaker 0: Let's I'm gonna fix this right now.

269
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:10,486
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, New York mayors do not have a history of - I would have I would have fixed it long before they got the head Number.

270
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:13,697
Speaker 1: step one ban uber in New York City full stop.

271
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:17,317
Speaker 1: number two In New York City full stop.

272
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:23,367
Speaker 0: Step three cancel all medallion debt period just like student loan debt.

273
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:28,116
Speaker 1: fully nationalize the taxis and make them part of the NTA Mmm, something like that.

274
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:30,225
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's calm.

275
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's communism here on gig nights tonight.

276
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,414
Speaker 1: But one other little news.

277
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:35,560
Speaker 1: a Gretsuko did get picked up.

278
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,380
Speaker 1: They have announced that there is a fourth season coming.

279
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:40,186
Speaker 0: I only ever watched season one.

280
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:42,073
Speaker 0: I don't know what's even going on that they could.

281
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:47,489
Speaker 1: so what I will say is the show Definitely got better and better and better as it went on.

282
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:50,499
Speaker 1: season two was far superior to season one.

283
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,760
Speaker 1: season three Okay, it goes more serious it the issues that it kind like in season one.

284
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,575
Speaker 1: It really like danced around these babies first like workplace and sexism issues.

285
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:03,734
Speaker 1: season two was like nope Look that look at that guy right there.

286
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:04,399
Speaker 1: That's a problem.

287
00:22:04,882 --> 00:22:10,162
Speaker 1: Season three like she's got a stalker and like shit goes down Mm-hmm.

288
00:22:10,544 --> 00:22:13,840
Speaker 1: The show is getting more and more real as it goes on and it's not the best show.

289
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:14,384
Speaker 1: Like it's not.

290
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:16,540
Speaker 1: I'm not like heavily looking forward to this.

291
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:36,856
Speaker 1: But if season four were out right now I would probably watch an episode tonight because I've run out of all the shows I'm watching right now Speaking of shows that if you know that I might watch again and that you should watch A revolutionary girl Utena shoujo kakame Utena is now

292
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:37,417
Speaker 0: on

293
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:38,380
Speaker 1: crunchyroll

294
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:41,815
Speaker 0: Alright, so I mean this show hasn't really been hard to watch.

295
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,040
Speaker 1: It was on YouTube legally.

296
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:47,040
Speaker 0: It was on yeah, like it was on YouTube legally for quite a period of time.

297
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,239
Speaker 1: I've got three different DVD box sets of this fucking show.

298
00:22:51,381 --> 00:22:58,012
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if for some reason you still haven't seen it or you want to watch it again It's gone crunchyroll as of today.

299
00:22:58,073 --> 00:23:00,566
Speaker 0: supposedly I didn't actually go check But they say it is.

300
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:10,765
Speaker 1: and before you ask no We are not continuing the Utena analysis show even though it is one super fun to do and two Super popular.

301
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:19,952
Speaker 1: the problem is I have been threatened with lawsuits and had problems So many times that we're basically never gonna make anime content on YouTube ever again.

302
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,402
Speaker 0: Let's just make some you know, some non YouTube Right.

303
00:23:23,463 --> 00:23:24,970
Speaker 0: Well, we'll get video.

304
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,558
Speaker 1: It's not even worth the effort.

305
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:28,489
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll I could set it up.

306
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:28,851
Speaker 0: We'll see.

307
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:29,615
Speaker 1: you can set it up.

308
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:30,098
Speaker 1: You could do it.

309
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:35,239
Speaker 1: I've seen that people have been getting anime takedowns on Twitch and other platforms, too.

310
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:42,500
Speaker 0: I'm talking about like put videos mp4s in an s3 bucket, right and then use up, you know?

311
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,063
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to continue our anime reviews.

312
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:50,130
Speaker 0: bootleg style right an HTML 5 video tag, right embed it in the web page.

313
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:54,934
Speaker 1: Try to get a partnership where we sponsor the blab and the blab hosts it for us.

314
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:58,498
Speaker 0: Just get a CDN You know or we could put them on.

315
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,106
Speaker 0: Like what if you put it on?

316
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:03,780
Speaker 0: one of those people are using the the porn sites to host things.

317
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:12,300
Speaker 1: The other thing we could do is if we do it that way we could also get it on YouTube Via burner accounts and as they get sued, we just put up more burner accounts.

318
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:18,732
Speaker 0: Maybe that's what we should do like make a you know Go there's a guy teaching like calculus on one of the porn sites.

319
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,780
Speaker 1: I think yeah, we could make it it all.

320
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:26,164
Speaker 1: Straight-up only fans kind of thing where we'll do the Utena show for you If you're like in there.

321
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:32,766
Speaker 1: the other way we could do it, you know, it doesn't get copyright only fans and you pay The other place.

322
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:40,168
Speaker 0: we could actually do this if we made them unlisted but then put them to patreon only would yeah But unless it still gets flagged.

323
00:24:40,248 --> 00:24:42,240
Speaker 1: I had unlisted videos flagged and give me strikes.

324
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:57,279
Speaker 1: Okay Another way to go would be to host them Directly like we did but hide them and the only place that link exists is via Patreon and patreon actually has some deals with some streaming platforms that don't seem to have any sort of.

325
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,023
Speaker 0: We can make it.

326
00:24:58,043 --> 00:24:58,566
Speaker 0: we can put that.

327
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:01,359
Speaker 0: you can put them in like free patreon post that anyone could see.

328
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:05,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, you click this link and it goes just goes to a video file on a CDN.

329
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,138
Speaker 0: Well, I'll load it and watch it in VLC.

330
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:10,051
Speaker 1: yep, because I have a lot more legal avenues to protect us.

331
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:15,560
Speaker 1: if patreon gets a DMCA then if like YouTube does because YouTube I pay all patreon has is a link.

332
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,175
Speaker 0: They don't have the video that the DMCA would have to go to.

333
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:19,080
Speaker 0: who's hosting the video?

334
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:28,736
Speaker 1: It should be like Amazon Web Service nine proxies If there's no way something like that would get to the point in the court where the lawyer is literally like.

335
00:25:28,976 --> 00:25:38,902
Speaker 1: so this bootleg video That was linked to from a site that you control but you claim you have nothing to do with Clearly shows two individuals who look exactly like you Know.

336
00:25:38,942 --> 00:25:40,429
Speaker 0: we would say let's watch the video.

337
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:42,759
Speaker 0: Is this look like a bootleg of the anime utenna?

338
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:47,640
Speaker 0: The problem is reviewing at Cisco and Ebert style.

339
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:49,906
Speaker 0: What is not fair use about this?

340
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:52,414
Speaker 1: So the problem is because of the way fair use is.

341
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:59,511
Speaker 1: even if you have absolutely Sacrosanct fair use the courts often will just rule against you.

342
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,839
Speaker 1: Anyway, and you have no fucking recourse the courts.

343
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:02,543
Speaker 0: That's alright We'll get.

344
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:20,454
Speaker 0: we'll get causes an affirmative defense We'll get a lawyer who's had a fair use case victories before and you know, yeah anyway things Of the day.

345
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:21,738
Speaker 1: so check this out.

346
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:31,873
Speaker 1: I found this YouTube channel and it's just this dude Steve Wallace and what he seems to do is Try to camp in Places.

347
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:34,650
Speaker 1: you're not allowed to camp in novel ways.

348
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:49,521
Speaker 1: so like find a rich suburb just camp like in the street like in a u-haul in that suburb and Goes through all the techniques to like not die survive not get caught by the cops Not have a weird neighbor like come out with a gun and bother you.

349
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:56,824
Speaker 1: He does things like camp inside of a culvert Camp behind a police station and not get noticed by the cops.

350
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,330
Speaker 1: camp on the side of the freeway.

351
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:00,382
Speaker 1: I'm gonna link to one that was pretty fun.

352
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:01,206
Speaker 1: It's a little long.

353
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:10,230
Speaker 1: It's like a half hour u-haul stealth camping in a 30 negative 35 degree weather day in a u-haul.

354
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:15,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I watched part of it and I got worried when he was using a full of fuel burning heat.

355
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:17,410
Speaker 1: He covers that right away.

356
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:23,754
Speaker 0: He's like I got a carbon monoxide detector and I got a vent open and I'm like that's still probably not great But I guess you didn't die.

357
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:26,925
Speaker 1: He's also got a low oxygen shut off and a couple other things going on.

358
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:27,868
Speaker 0: Yep.

359
00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:28,290
Speaker 0: That's true.

360
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:29,977
Speaker 1: It's just a real fun kind of thing.

361
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:32,486
Speaker 1: It's it's very adjacent to the urban exploration stuff.

362
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,949
Speaker 1: I like to do and This kind of thing looks real fun.

363
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:44,009
Speaker 1: I would love to see some people like do this at nerd Conventions with the caveat that you've got to have a way to shower or I do not condone you doing this.

364
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:46,970
Speaker 0: So there's a my thing of the day.

365
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:59,384
Speaker 0: there's a thing that happens very often in this world where a book will have a very You know books in particular that just so many of them Will have you know such a small amount of interest and a small print run.

366
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:01,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, and never be printed again.

367
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:17,190
Speaker 0: but that book might be actually quite significant or important perhaps to a niche or even a larger group of people and If the book has never been scanned and put on the internet or is not like in enough libraries.

368
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:20,001
Speaker 0: it could be a very inaccessible book right.

369
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:30,416
Speaker 0: so such that people know it exists and You know new people come around and are born into the world who are interested in the topic of that book and just can't get It right.

370
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:35,862
Speaker 0: It's like cannot be gotten And but they know about the book and it's very frustrating.

371
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:38,430
Speaker 0: So this is one of those situations.

372
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:48,679
Speaker 0: There is a book called cartoon modern and it's basically a book all about basically mid 20th century, you know cartoon art.

373
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:49,802
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

374
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:52,350
Speaker 1: I love this UPA kind of style, right?

375
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:54,396
Speaker 1: Often in the style.

376
00:28:54,718 --> 00:29:02,490
Speaker 0: if you don't know what UPA style means Just click on my thing of the day and as soon as you see the images you'll be like, oh that aesthetic.

377
00:29:02,651 --> 00:29:05,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the best fucking aesthetic ever that one, right?

378
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:14,535
Speaker 1: You know, oh just type you and just type UPA style into Google Images and a Cornucopia will open for you.

379
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,040
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much.

380
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,709
Speaker 0: You'll know exactly, you know, what's being talked about here.

381
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:33,870
Speaker 0: So This is basically like the ultimate like, you know, sort of Holy Grail ask book about UPA style animation And the creator of that book Said on the internet, right?

382
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:36,940
Speaker 0: Man it's a shame that book isn't out there.

383
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:39,130
Speaker 0: I wish someone would just scan it and put it online.

384
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:55,208
Speaker 0: So if you go to this thing of the day this article written about the book they just scan that fucker in as best they could and you could just click and download a 319 megabyte PDF and get the damn book good as as it should be.

385
00:29:55,228 --> 00:30:01,919
Speaker 0: so Get this book before I Mean, I got the PDF.

386
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:04,690
Speaker 0: you can always get it from me, but you can still download it from this link.

Speaker 0: read the article that goes into great detail about.

391
00:30:15,426 --> 00:30:16,250
Speaker 0: you know, what the deal is.

392
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:17,810
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be reading the articles there.

393
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,630
Speaker 1: But after I look at all those beautiful image, I it's hard to express how much I love that style of animation in particular.

394
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,438
Speaker 0: That's the style.

395
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:23,801
Speaker 0: I don't know.

403
00:30:54,242 --> 00:31:00,819
Speaker 1: Atari game design from paxis online 2021 At least I not likely is like a 0.1% chance.

404
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,641
Speaker 1: Scott will be there too.

405

Speaker 1: Doing a panel which is a Updated rewrite of a panel.

408
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:21,470
Speaker 1: We did a draft version of years ago at magfest called rare game mechanics But I'm rewriting it based on like how that went the first time and focusing entirely on tabletop.

409
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:26,648
Speaker 1: I'm literally gonna roll into the con do this panel and Immediately go back home.

410
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:36,510
Speaker 1: It's up to you if you want to go to the con But I will tell you right now You do not need to go to packs unplugged to see this panel because of course, I'm gonna bring all the fucking equipment.

411
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,274
Speaker 1: I'm gonna record it.

412
00:31:37,515 --> 00:31:40,449
Speaker 1: It's gonna be on YouTube that weekend like by Sunday.

413
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:45,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, so yeah, I guess that that's what you want to do.

414
00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:46,486
Speaker 0: go ahead.

415
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:47,690
Speaker 1: it's like it's like an hour.

416
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,980
Speaker 1: It's just not a long drive.

417
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,210
Speaker 1: I'll just drive there do it and drive back.

418
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,518
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it's pretty much all we got.

419
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,589
Speaker 1: let's get ready to this main bit cuz I'm already getting a little hungry here.

420
00:31:57,011 --> 00:31:58,598
Speaker 1: So, uh, this is this.

421
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,070
Speaker 1: apparently this manga and anime are popular.

422
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:06,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what I did is I went and I was like, you know, hey Let's do an episode on something that you know.

423
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:12,170
Speaker 0: Usually it's like something that I was into and then I tell rim to watch or read it or vice versa, right?

424
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,549
Speaker 0: I'm like, let's go find.

425
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:20,270
Speaker 0: You know the popular thing these days that neither of us care about and we'll probably never read or watch otherwise.

426
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:26,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, and go go check it out and see what the deal is With judge anime by its cover.

427
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:31,230
Speaker 1: to ignore anything that doesn't isn't obviously good for you because the internet will tell you later.

428
00:32:31,551 --> 00:32:36,710
Speaker 1: So occasionally we have to make sure that we haven't missed something that like we're just everyone's talking about and we're ignoring.

429
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:40,419
Speaker 0: So I went to Amazon and I clicked on the.

430
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:49,843
Speaker 0: they have a page bestsellers in manga comics graphic novels And I guess right now jiu-jitsu cousin only has one entry in the top.

431
00:32:50,645 --> 00:33:01,910
Speaker 0: Oh, no has two entries in the top 20 number nine and number 17 But at the time that I checked it had several like four or five volumes were up there in the top 20.

432
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:07,735
Speaker 1: Oh and as of October 2021 as of last month jiu-jitsu kaisen.

433
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:15,730
Speaker 1: the manga has over five fifty five million copies in circulation and The prequel to it jiu-jitsu kaisen zero.

434
00:33:16,272 --> 00:33:21,690
Speaker 1: Combined with the the regular run make it one of the best-selling manga of all time.

435
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:26,630
Speaker 0: Right, so I don't know if it's at the my hero academia one piece level.

436
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,539
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's it my.

437
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,645
Speaker 1: I think I have the list.

438
00:33:29,685 --> 00:33:30,610
Speaker 1: I'm looking it up right now.

439
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:37,860
Speaker 0: I think it's a little bit behind chainsaw man a little bit but not much, you know It's basically one of the big shonen mangas these days, right?

440
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:39,466
Speaker 0: Yeah been around for a while.

441
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:39,927
Speaker 0: Actually.

442
00:33:39,947 --> 00:33:44,228
Speaker 1: It's not that new It's not in the top 20, but it's in the top 50.

443
00:33:44,228 --> 00:33:44,650
Speaker 1: Oh, you know what?

444
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,132
Speaker 1: You know what?

445
00:33:45,152 --> 00:33:49,005
Speaker 1: The next most popular manga is Initial D.

446
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:55,730
Speaker 0: No Okay, it's a. it's above Ranma 1/2 and below initial D, but you're looking at like an all-time list.

447
00:33:55,871 --> 00:33:57,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is an all-time list list.

448
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,748
Speaker 0: I'm talking about like the now list.

449
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:03,837
Speaker 0: Yep Regardless jiu-jitsu kaisen I all I knew was that yes I recognize that name.

450
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:14,118
Speaker 0: that is the name of a shonen anime manga that I have never watched or read and know nothing about other than that, it's a popular shonen and I said, well, it seems to be really popular.

451
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,583
Speaker 0: It's been around for a while.

452
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:21,846
Speaker 0: It's not super new but not super old and I could just get the first volume digitally and read it.

453
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:23,413
Speaker 0: and Why not it?

454
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:27,889
Speaker 0: what shouldn't take long a shonen manga doesn't take long to read it all and then we could do an episode on it.

455
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:28,793
Speaker 0: So that's what we did.

456
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:33,850
Speaker 0: We read the first volume of jiu-jitsu kaisen and I can tell you that it is indeed a shonen manga.

457
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:35,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's uh the end.

458
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:47,944
Speaker 1: it is so shonen manga that I could you could almost like predict exactly like when they go to meet the the principal of the magic school Who's gonna like determine if the guy gets to go into the magic school?

459
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:59,177
Speaker 1: as soon as I saw him I was like that's gonna be the guy who seems weird and flippant and not that powerful But actually is a big deal and there's gonna be like a big turnabout right there And they're gonna let him into the school.

460
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:07,288
Speaker 1: You can predict everything that's gonna happen Not the specific details of how fight unless this is a first shonen manga or that you've ever what read.

461
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:07,930
Speaker 0: there is an anime.

462
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,917
Speaker 0: I didn't watch that though.

463
00:35:09,198 --> 00:35:10,467
Speaker 0: I assume it's just the same thing.

464
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:18,450
Speaker 1: Yep I assume so too but reading it all it made me want to do is stop reading it and go read more chainsaw man.

465
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:25,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I think that's the thing, you know If you're talking about recent shonen mangas that are popular that we personally have read

466
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:29,490
Speaker 1: Anything that makes this stand out to me at all

467
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:35,070
Speaker 0: Those are those are the only two that we have experience with that are new and popular at shonen's.

468
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, and chainsaw man has some uniqueness to it, right?

469
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,355
Speaker 0: You know, it's not just you know.

470
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:47,614
Speaker 1: executing on the formula chainsaw man leaves mysteries early on unresolved that I'm interested in.

471
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:58,810
Speaker 1: it also goes a lot harder moves a lot faster and every time I think it's gonna follow a shonen trope it Like jumps miles past that what would I would expect to be an entire arc?

472
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:06,190
Speaker 0: Well, it also just you know, just visually chainsaw man the aesthetic right this dude with two fucking chainsaws coming out.

473
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know his face, right?

474
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:10,185
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you look at jiu-jitsu kaisen.

475
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:11,390
Speaker 0: It's very well drawn.

476
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,437
Speaker 0: The art is actually quite incredible.

477
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:17,230
Speaker 1: the faces jump around like there are really funny faces in the background often.

478
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:22,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think probably the thing that sells it the most is the art, you know, it really reminds, you know.

479
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:26,861
Speaker 0: Especially the backgrounds, you know are so, you know, beautiful architecturally.

480
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:29,428
Speaker 0: the way like the backgrounds and death note are yeah.

481
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:33,883
Speaker 0: Yeah But like nothing like is cool.

482
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:36,110
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, that's a anime monster.

483
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:39,762
Speaker 0: It's not particularly cool or memorable or awesome in it.

484
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:42,270
Speaker 0: It's just oh they're using some powers.

485
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:48,730
Speaker 1: Okay, their powers are strength and oh, look the protagonist is weirdly powerful and no one can explain why.

486
00:36:49,691 --> 00:36:52,721
Speaker 0: Yeah, so just short plot summary of volume one.

487
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:55,550
Speaker 0: there's a character who's clearly the protagonist the good guy.

488
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:57,895
Speaker 0: He's super strong for no reason.

489
00:36:58,577 --> 00:36:59,359
Speaker 0: He's in school.

490
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,604
Speaker 0: There's school shit going on, right?

491
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:06,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not a Transported to another world scenario.

492
00:37:06,797 --> 00:37:08,802
Speaker 0: It's the second thing where it's like.

493
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:14,369
Speaker 0: actually there's stuff going on in the real world But only some people see it and know about it.

494
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:24,110
Speaker 0: So even though we're not gonna physically transport you to a different world You're going to sort of enter this under society where this other stuff is happening.

495
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:26,763
Speaker 1: You you haka show did that to a degree?

496
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:28,330
Speaker 0: I'm a card cap to Sakura.

497
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,173
Speaker 0: There's this whole world.

498
00:37:29,234 --> 00:37:30,358
Speaker 0: go Sailor Moon.

499
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,149
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon fucking war is whole world, right?

500
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,129
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, you know of earth people do an earth shit.

501
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:43,130
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, there's this galactic battle happening and the normal earth people don't know about it.

502
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:51,328
Speaker 0: Right, it's you know The sailors are in this other world where they have to battle while still being in the normal earth world.

503
00:37:51,408 --> 00:38:00,248
Speaker 0: at the same time Same same old trope here There's a world of like these curses some excited demonic thing going on curse with a capital C.

504
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:06,970
Speaker 1: They're like Evangelion angel monster type things but most of them are really weak and there's a whole thing with them.

505
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,195
Speaker 0: That's not only some.

506
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:11,570
Speaker 0: people can see and detect them and fight them and they're bad.

507
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:17,363
Speaker 1: They're caused by Human, hope and human fear and traumatic events and all this generic stuff.

508
00:38:17,704 --> 00:38:17,904
Speaker 0: Yep.

509
00:38:17,944 --> 00:38:19,970
Speaker 0: They hang out near bad places, right?

510
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:22,118
Speaker 0: And there's this one mega demon.

511
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:23,785
Speaker 0: I guess this is this real similar.

512
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:24,870
Speaker 1: There's a Vecna.

513
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:28,201
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really similar to chainsaw man.

514
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:30,250
Speaker 0: Actually where they're collecting the pieces of the gun.

515
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:31,833
Speaker 1: That was soon.

516
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:36,630
Speaker 1: They were like he ate the finger and then they're like, oh, yeah, so there's a bunch more of these fingers.

517
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,579
Speaker 1: We got to collect them all.

518
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,750
Speaker 1: that's clearly the plot.

519
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:50,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like, you know, I guess at least there's less fingers than there are crystal shards and a new yasha But there's more than there are one pieces in one piece where there's only there's only one.

520
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:52,133
Speaker 1: there's one piece One piece.

521
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:53,197
Speaker 0: this is like I don't know what.

522
00:38:53,237 --> 00:38:54,681
Speaker 0: how many pieces do they say there were?

523
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:55,805
Speaker 0: I have four hands.

524
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:56,748
Speaker 1: Yes four arms.

525
00:38:58,191 --> 00:38:59,214
Speaker 0: So there's 20 fingers.

526
00:38:59,435 --> 00:38:59,595
Speaker 0: Yep.

527
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:00,879
Speaker 1: So there's 20 fingers.

528
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:04,410
Speaker 1: This kid has to physically eat and their Vecna looking fingers.

529
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:07,778
Speaker 1: They're just like these mummified Horrible little jerkies.

530
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, they belong to some old evil dude.

531
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:18,755
Speaker 0: So he's gonna get all the fingers and then he's got to somehow contain the evil dude within himself by will Or become the evil dude.

532
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:21,001
Speaker 0: Yeah, the evil dude takes over his body.

533
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:22,445
Speaker 0: He's already super strong.

534
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:26,448
Speaker 0: So that would be kind of bad If that happened, I'm sure it will.

535
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:33,850
Speaker 1: But yeah, yada yada yada He ends up being inducted into the magic ninja warrior school.

536
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:37,607
Speaker 1: That is just a normal high school, but everyone there is doing the same kind of thing.

537
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:38,090
Speaker 1: He's doing.

538
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:41,242
Speaker 0: Yep, it's right now.

539
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:42,126
Speaker 0: How did?

540
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:42,770
Speaker 0: the question is?

541
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:48,290
Speaker 0: Why is this such a ridiculously popular shonen manga among the shonen mangas?

542
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:55,130
Speaker 0: And the only things I can say is either a something must happen in a future volume that shakes it up, right?

543
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:03,790
Speaker 0: I don't know if there is such a thing because I haven't read past volume 1 but nothing in volume 1 suggests that's coming But I I'm open to that possibility.

544
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:10,715
Speaker 0: Clearly there's a twist where they write they started out following the formula and they said this isn't working Right.

545
00:40:11,037 --> 00:40:13,330
Speaker 0: Let's do something off the wall.

546
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,001
Speaker 0: And that's what made jiu-jitsu kaisen a big deal.

547
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:27,604
Speaker 0: and if that's the case and you know, it's the case Please tell me in which volume that occurs because if it's volume 2 I might read it Maybe but if it's 3 or higher no chance, I'm back.

548
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:36,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not happening Or it just follows the shonen formula and that's still a successful thing that you can do these days.

549
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:52,503
Speaker 1: the end Wikipedia now looking at like so far everything I've skimmed over giant long arcs does not imply that there is Anything different that's gonna happen from the kind of things we already read.

550
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,390
Speaker 1: It's you know, I describe it.

551
00:40:55,316 --> 00:41:02,098
Speaker 1: Take the feel of Naruto And cross it with the feel of chainsaw man.

552
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,370
Speaker 1: set it in modern-day Japan and make everything less extreme.

553
00:41:07,193 --> 00:41:18,769
Speaker 0: hmm, so I do want to say the the right the crater right gig a Akutami, which might be a pen name or mate might not be this creator.

554
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:26,550
Speaker 0: It says in the book here They published a few short works before starting jiu-jitsu kaisen which again and shown and jump in 2018.

555
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:36,677
Speaker 0: So this is this person's like first big real deal ongoing manga That they've ever made right.

556
00:41:37,098 --> 00:41:40,288
Speaker 0: so for them to get such a big hit off the bat?

557
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:41,233
Speaker 0: basically Right.

558
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:44,230
Speaker 0: The only things they did before this were little short short deals.

559
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:46,953
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

560
00:41:46,994 --> 00:41:49,160
Speaker 0: well that's actually you know, it's seeing the art.

561
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,450
Speaker 0: I guess that that might you know be a contributing factor.

562
00:41:55,207 --> 00:42:00,136
Speaker 0: But Yeah, I don't know I Guess if you really like the shonen formula.

563
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:04,790
Speaker 0: see I like the shonen formula, but only when there's an extra spice on it, right?

564
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get Jojo's gives you an extra spice of style, right?

565
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,470
Speaker 0: Yeah fist of the North Star gives you an extra spice of exploding heads chainsaw man extra spice of chainsaws.

566
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:15,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got.

567
00:42:15,937 --> 00:42:17,625
Speaker 1: it's got the music right.

568
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:25,870
Speaker 0: one punch man Started off with some special spice but lately it's been going, you know The only thing it has left really nowadays that they're sort of gotten away.

569
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:33,610
Speaker 0: I might stop reading it even even though that might sound horrifying Because they've really gotten away from the whole Saitama one punch man thing.

570
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:38,212
Speaker 0: it's not about all the other characters just doing shown in battle stuff and Those.

571
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:48,830
Speaker 0: the only thing that really has merit is the fact that all the characters are really well designed Interesting, you know fun characters right like poor you pretty prisoner and stuff, right?

572
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,760
Speaker 0: But I've seen enough of very pretty prisoner.

573
00:42:51,781 --> 00:42:53,085
Speaker 0: is you know, he's not as funny.

574
00:42:53,126 --> 00:42:56,285
Speaker 0: just showing him to me again And again, it doesn't stay funny.

575
00:42:56,385 --> 00:43:00,009
Speaker 0: So I don't know how long one punch man can hold out.

576
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:01,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's just.

577
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:02,178
Speaker 1: it's hard this.

578
00:43:02,398 --> 00:43:04,506
Speaker 0: this doesn't even hold out past volume.

579
00:43:04,546 --> 00:43:06,828
Speaker 1: what I do have a theory I've always thought about that.

580
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:19,994
Speaker 1: There's this ebb and flow of shonen where in general any random person who starts reading manga anywhere in the world If they've never encountered shown in before they often get into it like everyone gets into one Like it's a real.

581
00:43:20,115 --> 00:43:23,426
Speaker 0: it is a really good formula and you know the deal.

582
00:43:23,526 --> 00:43:24,670
Speaker 1: like you don't know what's coming.

583
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:27,845
Speaker 1: You just see it's like long power creep long arcs.

584
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:28,990
Speaker 1: you get into these characters.

585
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:30,756
Speaker 1: I see why people get pulled in.

586
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:34,851
Speaker 1: but then I thought then I see the second shown in manga the third one in the fourth One.

587
00:43:34,871 --> 00:43:35,814
Speaker 1: I see they're all the same.

588
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:44,449
Speaker 1: I think every time a shonen manga comes out the crucial factor is How big is the previous big one still?

589
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:48,490
Speaker 1: and Will new people getting inducted into the world of shonen?

590
00:43:49,150 --> 00:44:00,090
Speaker 1: Read the one that's already big or is there a lull and they read a different one and at my end then Whichever one is new that is the best or just there at the right time becomes the next big one.

591
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:07,845
Speaker 0: mmm, I mean To its credit while this is just you know, a standard shonen formula.

592
00:44:07,865 --> 00:44:09,730
Speaker 0: It is well executed.

593
00:44:10,352 --> 00:44:11,957
Speaker 0: It's like they are going quickly.

594
00:44:12,278 --> 00:44:13,301
Speaker 0: It has there's nothing.

595
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:14,805
Speaker 0: there's nothing like bad about this.

596
00:44:14,865 --> 00:44:17,370
Speaker 0: It's not like oh, there's this heart It's really poorly.

597
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:18,996
Speaker 1: Dialogues pretty good.

598
00:44:19,016 --> 00:44:21,009
Speaker 1: The characters are all really different and really funny.

599
00:44:21,952 --> 00:44:27,710
Speaker 1: The girl when the girl and the dumbass protagonist are both just petting the spirit dog instead of dealing with the crap.

600
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:32,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there is nothing bad about this shonen manga.

601
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:33,654
Speaker 0: It's just so.

602
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:43,685
Speaker 0: I've you know, because I'm old I've seen this a thousand times and there's nothing Special to recommend it Over any of the other options.

603
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,520
Speaker 1: in the same I'd almost say I wouldn't recommend reading it.

604
00:44:48,082 --> 00:44:53,284
Speaker 1: if you if you've never had shown and you think you might like shonen Read either one piece or Naruto and see if you like that.

605
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:57,809
Speaker 1: and if you do But you want or you wanted something a little more hardcore or weird.

606
00:44:58,392 --> 00:45:07,370
Speaker 0: I think if you want to me if you if you've never read a show them before you should stick to this the special ones That I mentioned right the ones that have something, you know extra going on, right?

607
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,645
Speaker 0: You don't want to read the boring everyday ones.

608
00:45:09,686 --> 00:45:17,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I guess if you like chainsaw man and Naruto and just want more of that kind of stuff This might be like the best possible manga for you.

609
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:18,591
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean there.

610
00:45:18,611 --> 00:45:25,910
Speaker 0: I guess there are people out there who just will eat up this formula no matter how many times it's Regurgitated and you could do worse than this one.

611
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:28,737
Speaker 1: This is one of the better ones by far.

612
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:32,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of garbage shonens out there that are poorly drawn.

613
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:33,413
Speaker 0: Right.

614
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:36,808
Speaker 0: that the plot doesn't make sense like bleach is way worse than this thing.

615
00:45:36,848 --> 00:45:37,229
Speaker 1: Oh my god

616
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:38,854
Speaker 0: Right, so

617
00:45:39,355 --> 00:45:53,941
Speaker 1: and at least this doesn't do the thing that I'm still mad at you you hawkish you for because that show persisted longer than most shonen do on being more about the school and more fun and Then it turned into shonen and I almost didn't realize it at first.

618
00:45:54,242 --> 00:45:59,607
Speaker 1: and I'm still mad at Naruto for giving up on Awesome ninja school hijinks and turning into a shonen fighting show.

619
00:46:00,813 --> 00:46:01,094
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

620
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:07,885
Speaker 1: if Naruto had just been ninja school over the years and then ninja school at the college years Might have kept reading and watching that.

621
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:12,390
Speaker 0: but yeah Yeah, I do feel you know, it's only based on volume one.

622
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:17,200
Speaker 0: So I guess you can't really you know Get a get a good feel for the pacing based on that.

623
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:17,682
Speaker 0: because you have all.

624
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:27,781
Speaker 0: the introductory part does move pretty quick right, but it's not a sequence of Fights right even when they start fighting monsters.

625
00:46:27,982 --> 00:46:30,370
Speaker 0: It doesn't feel like this is going to become.

626
00:46:31,093 --> 00:46:38,670
Speaker 0: You know the the the timing of it is gonna be like oh every chapter They're have to fight a monster like a tournament kind of deal.

627
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:53,216
Speaker 0: It feels like it's gonna you know, follow that sort of back and forth pattern where you know Here's the part where every you know, they're talking and working on things and then like the first fight They really have is with it.

628
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:56,630
Speaker 1: Actually one of the most dangerous possible things and it kind of leads to that

629
00:46:57,453 --> 00:47:13,846
Speaker 0: Right, so chainsaw man has that same structure right what you think is a more modern structure of okay Here's the downtime where all these characters talk and sort out their deal and whatever and then the thing happens And now they go into finally a nothing in the fighting chapters where there's an encounter.

630
00:47:13,887 --> 00:47:14,810
Speaker 0: It's almost like an RPG.

631
00:47:14,991 --> 00:47:17,022
Speaker 0: It's initial walking and talking in town.

632
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,449
Speaker 0: Did that the encounters?

633
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:29,675
Speaker 1: To an extreme degree initially is mostly talking in school stuff and then every several episodes They'll be the fight Not the race.

634
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:38,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, which always there's an episode that leads up to the race There's an episode that ends at the start of the race and then there's an episode that is the race.

635
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:43,990
Speaker 1: So it's three up three or two six episodes and out of the fun stuff and then three episodes of the race.

636
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:48,916
Speaker 0: right the opposite of that would be like Something like your pedal.

637
00:47:48,977 --> 00:47:52,627
Speaker 0: your pedal is like, you know school school school and then race.

638
00:47:53,811 --> 00:47:57,522
Speaker 0: There's a one race and that one race goes on for fucking ever.

639
00:47:57,682 --> 00:47:59,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just doesn't.

640
00:47:59,247 --> 00:48:02,210
Speaker 0: it's like just chapters And they break that race down.

641
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:07,530
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, you would get like one chapter for like a whole months of school, right?

642
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:12,549
Speaker 0: And then you'll get one chapter for like just it's the start of the race.

643
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:14,414
Speaker 1: Well, it's like Ophery.

644
00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:28,148
Speaker 1: that would literally be like here is every single pitch and every single at-bat for an entire Nine innings of baseball and then and then the same number of pages will be dedicated to like all of the school that happens between that.

645
00:48:31,758 --> 00:48:35,590
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah this was I'm gonna spend a while.

646
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:46,402
Speaker 1: It was almost kind of like when we started playing quake one deathmatch again recently and it's such a like bog standard Simplistic like no respawn invincibility like simple game.

647
00:48:46,903 --> 00:48:49,010
Speaker 1: and yet it was almost refreshing how simple it was.

648
00:48:49,472 --> 00:48:53,870
Speaker 1: I did have a feeling of how refreshing this was when I was reading it and it was just like yep.

649
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,180
Speaker 1: It's shown in ten pages still shown in.

650
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,270
Speaker 1: Oh, look, it just kept shown inning.

651
00:48:58,712 --> 00:49:02,429
Speaker 1: It was oddly refreshing but not to the point that I want to read more of it.

652
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:08,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess it's like, you know, it's like a you know, it's like a just a normal old burger, right?

653
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:08,752
Speaker 0: It's like.

654
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:14,943
Speaker 0: well, I'm not like a fancy burger at the Baroness not Fancy one where I'm gonna recommend it and be like.

655
00:49:14,963 --> 00:49:16,170
Speaker 0: you gotta eat this burger.

656
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:20,710
Speaker 0: It was something else but it wasn't a McDonald's burger that I would say poison don't know.

657
00:49:20,931 --> 00:49:27,750
Speaker 0: It's like if you're hungry, this will satisfy but there's no particular reason to seek it out nor avoid it.

658
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,289
Speaker 1: It's like a Shake Shack burger.

659
00:49:30,193 --> 00:49:31,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there.

660
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:33,490
Speaker 0: it is available tasty.

661
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:41,989
Speaker 0: Okay, you know If you got time and you really want to read a manga Just as a guy said it's a thing.

662
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:47,232
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess we'll end on really quick because with this show is a little shorter because there's not that much to say about This thing.

663
00:49:47,554 --> 00:49:50,050
Speaker 1: the listener actually has a question that we could both try to answer really quickly.

664
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:57,667
Speaker 1: Okay, if we could pick a Western novel to Western being a very vague category to get an anime adaptation.

665
00:49:58,168 --> 00:49:58,870
Speaker 1: What would we choose?

666
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:03,059
Speaker 0: Okay, so but I'm gonna change your Western.

667
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,263
Speaker 0: I'm gonna replace Western.

668
00:50:04,724 --> 00:50:05,126
Speaker 0: lately.

669
00:50:05,146 --> 00:50:06,490
Speaker 0: I've learned a cool thing.

670
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:09,086
Speaker 0: We're gonna replace the term Western.

671
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:14,330
Speaker 0: Yes Golf playing nation, I like golf playing nations a lot, right?

672
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,750
Speaker 0: So that does actually include Japan I guess but not that's fine.

673
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:29,569
Speaker 0: But yeah, but basically the golf the places on earth where golf is played are the wealthy places right, so and mostly, you know, Scotland UK you at right.

674
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:36,305
Speaker 0: so What most people would consider West yeah overlaps heavily with the places where golf is.

675
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,990
Speaker 1: I think a mine is actually really easy.

676
00:50:38,432 --> 00:50:47,878
Speaker 1: I would pick any culture series book and my rationale is They're so weird that Animation is probably the only way to do it effectively.

677
00:50:47,898 --> 00:50:49,443
Speaker 0: It's not a bad choice.

678
00:50:49,744 --> 00:50:49,925
Speaker 1: Also.

679
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:51,550
Speaker 1: I just why would I watch the shit out of that?

680
00:50:53,513 --> 00:50:57,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, I you know not having a lot of time to think about it.

681
00:50:57,626 --> 00:50:58,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went off the cuff.

682
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,722
Speaker 0: I'm sure I'm missing if I had more time to think about this.

683
00:51:01,822 --> 00:51:03,710
Speaker 0: I could probably give a fucking terrific answer.

684
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:06,219
Speaker 0: I'll probably come up with a terrific answer very soon.

685
00:51:06,279 --> 00:51:09,330
Speaker 1: Probably like 10 seconds after I hit stop stream, right?

686
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,560
Speaker 0: But obviously any Neal Stephenson book is gonna be on.

687
00:51:12,901 --> 00:51:14,727
Speaker 1: Oh diamond age the anime, right?

688
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:15,811
Speaker 0: It's just.

689
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:18,103
Speaker 0: you could even just do it's like you.

690
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,048
Speaker 0: can you go wrong?

691
00:51:19,108 --> 00:51:19,390
Speaker 0: Really?

692
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:20,132
Speaker 0: It's gonna work.

693
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:23,186
Speaker 1: snow crash would just do it like ghost in the shell.

694
00:51:23,207 --> 00:51:23,910
Speaker 1: Just go all y'all.

695
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:25,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

696
00:51:25,276 --> 00:51:25,778
Speaker 0: Just gets to.

697
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:27,043
Speaker 0: you know, you get production IG.

698
00:51:27,144 --> 00:51:28,630
Speaker 0: obviously no one else, right?

699
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:32,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I want diamond age over snow crash because diamond I do too.

700
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:35,350
Speaker 0: But I'm what I'm saying is that snow crash couldn't go wrong.
