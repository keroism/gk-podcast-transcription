1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,165
Speaker 1: It's Monday August 12th 2013.

2
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:16,229
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,430
Speaker 1: Scott and Google glass.

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,450
Speaker 1: Let's do this in front of a live studio audience.

5
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:32,110
Speaker 1: We've got some friends over in the other room probably listening to a shout into our microphones with the door open.

6
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:34,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that's how we roll here.

7
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:43,590
Speaker 1: So while we were at the beach Wildwood and I got to say I've been going to Wildwood, New Jersey, which used to have a pretty great arcade culture.

8
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:45,782
Speaker 1: In fact, I think we've talked about this on old geek nights.

9
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:49,690
Speaker 1: There used to be DDR machines up and down the boardwalk.

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,170
Speaker 1: We would literally spend the morning at the beach and spend the entire evening playing games in arcades.

11
00:00:55,812 --> 00:01:10,398
Speaker 1: I think I must have dumped hundreds of dollars over the years total in all these things police 9-1-1 DDR mostly DDR sometimes air hockey and Yeah as of last year there are exactly zero DDR machines on the boardwalk.

12
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:13,530
Speaker 1: In fact, the majority of the arcade don't even have a pump machine anymore.

13
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:16,830
Speaker 1: I know they don't even have in the groove machines.

14
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:17,812
Speaker 0: They don't have.

15
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:24,990
Speaker 0: the only game I saw that was like a real game was that one time crisis 3 machine that was for sale.

16
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, the arcade was trying to sell it.

17
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:27,641
Speaker 0: I guess there was a Ms.

18
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:28,565
Speaker 0: Pac-man I guess.

19
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:28,987
Speaker 1: Yeah that Ms.

20
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:29,670
Speaker 1: Pac-man didn't work.

21
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:30,318
Speaker 1: I checked it out.

22
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:37,000
Speaker 1: Oh There's also that Kind of all the really stylish looking Pac-man versus game.

23
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,365
Speaker 1: That's actually a shit game.

24
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:39,950
Speaker 0: Oh Pac-man battle royale.

25
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,336
Speaker 1: I feel like the arcade that bought.

26
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:43,103
Speaker 1: that feels really dumb about buying.

27
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,670
Speaker 0: No, they probably make a bunch of money on it.

28
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,521
Speaker 1: Oh, why didn't see anyone playing it?

29
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:47,850
Speaker 0: We were there for a minute.

30
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:49,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone is playing.

31
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,910
Speaker 0: the other the Pac-man with a million the air hockey Pac-man with a million pucks.

32
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,355
Speaker 1: Yeah, two little kids were playing that.

33
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:56,303
Speaker 0: Oh, how family was playing it.

34
00:01:56,464 --> 00:02:00,123
Speaker 0: Yeah that game not so great No, but it's good on paper.

35
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:02,374
Speaker 1: It's just so sad.

36
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:06,770
Speaker 0: I like Pac-man and I like air hockey, but that Pac-man game is butt.

37
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:09,464
Speaker 1: Yep, like the buttest of butt.

38
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:09,866
Speaker 0: Yep.

39
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,219
Speaker 1: But yeah arcades are dead at least in the US.

40
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:23,389
Speaker 1: but we can at least say one thing we went to our arcades in Australia and They were about at the level of the few remaining arcades in the US that aren't butt.

41
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:31,510
Speaker 1: Maybe slightly better because they had Mario Kart, but it doesn't count for much because the Mario Kart arcade machine is actually pretty butt.

42
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:35,492
Speaker 0: Yeah Arcades are pretty.

43
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:40,806
Speaker 0: I mean the saddest thing about the arcades is really the mobile iPhone game arcade versions.

44
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,390
Speaker 0: the temple run arcade machine.

45
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:42,969
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

46
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:45,599
Speaker 0: Arcade machine it's like that.

47
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:57,209
Speaker 1: at least there wasn't an Angry Birds arcade machine Especially because you look at this thing and it's clearly just one of those TV touch screens and an actual Regular old computer with a case around it and a dollar thing connected to it.

48
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably connected into a serial port in the back of said computer.

49
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:05,285
Speaker 0: It's really just a phone with a giant touchscreen and a coin slot.

50
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:09,602
Speaker 1: I might make some money I'll get some ooh, yes, and I'll just put those in arcades.

51
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:10,486
Speaker 0: Sure.

52
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,560
Speaker 1: Yeah But I have another problem in my life.

53
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:18,810
Speaker 1: I have I got a Nexus S Phone and it's pretty much the iPhone is pretty good.

54
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,930
Speaker 1: But I still think the Nexus S has the best physical form factor of any phone.

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:32,857
Speaker 0: I think the Nokia Lumia the smaller one has the best form factor of any phone because it's basically it's like an iPod nano Construction true true and it has the best camera.

56
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:35,263
Speaker 0: Also, that's you know, just fact.

57
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:41,583
Speaker 1: but I got a problem that I'm on Sprint CDMA 4g but it's ymax 4g.

58
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:44,514
Speaker 1: my phone does not support Switching to LTE.

59
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:49,050
Speaker 1: sprint has been switching for a long time and has not switched yet not completely.

60
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,342
Speaker 1: Basically there will be a time when my 4g will stop working.

61
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:54,105
Speaker 0: that is true.

62
00:03:54,366 --> 00:04:00,206
Speaker 1: and of the phones I can buy I mean, I own a Nexus 4 for world travel and I got to tell you motherfuckers who like your big phones.

63
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,779
Speaker 1: I Cannot sit down with that thing in my pocket.

64
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,175
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone finally wrote an article that was like, you know Look all these big phones.

65
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:08,837
Speaker 0: What the fuck.

66
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:12,450
Speaker 0: there's basically no small phones that are also top-of-the-line phones.

67
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:19,529
Speaker 0: All the small phones are basically gimped in terms of you know Having the fastest CPUs are the best GPUs are the best screens or whatever?

68
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,959
Speaker 1: No, it seems like that the iPhone consumer sentiment driving it.

69
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,090
Speaker 0: but it's weird because I think I think it's more marketing shaping consumer demand.

70
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,545
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean like with SUVs?

71
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:29,387
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah.

72
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:36,338
Speaker 1: But the people who say they prefer big phones and aren't just being facetious to troll me Seem to say one of two things.

73
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:50,645
Speaker 1: they either say I want a big screen because I play games and watch movies on it and use it as my primary computer when I'm traveling or They say Effectively I have bad eyesight and I can't see anything on tiny phones.

74
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:54,870
Speaker 0: go to the eye doctor If bad eyesight is hindering you in some way.

75
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:06,065
Speaker 0: The solution is never to change your technology like increasing the resolution on your screen to a resolution That is lower than the you know The native resolution of the display or any you know and not.

76
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:07,250
Speaker 0: that is never the right answer.

77
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,950
Speaker 0: The right answer is always go to the eye doctor.

78
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:17,437
Speaker 0: Right if you are modifying your technological purchasing decisions because of your visual Disability and it's not.

79
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:30,250
Speaker 0: I mean there could be a point at which you are like You know seriously visually impaired like you're blind or near blind and you need like the magnifying A large not a large majority but a large or you need some Braille shit, right?

80
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,761
Speaker 1: I think a surprising number of Americans for whatever reason have Significant uncorrected vision problems.

81
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:42,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you have you know Like there was a guy at RIT who lived on my floor in freshman year and he was almost blind, right?

82
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:48,710
Speaker 0: You basically had a giant magnifying thing in front of his monitor, right that dude needs technology to help him with his almost blindness.

83
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:56,200
Speaker 0: But if you you know live your daily life and you're not almost blind You don't have a white stick dragging on the ground, right?

84
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,410
Speaker 0: The eye doctor is your answer and not the best vibe.

85
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:06,430
Speaker 1: Well, I do know a lot of people who have Moderate myopia or light myopia but not enough to actually prevent them from living.

86
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,629
Speaker 1: so as a result they tend to not get glasses when they're young and get used to the world being just kind of fuzzy.

87
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:15,509
Speaker 1: and I think that's a problem because myopia is pretty common.

88
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:21,170
Speaker 1: And I guess I was lucky in the sense that when I was young I had myopia but it was just bad enough.

89
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:22,219
Speaker 1: So, you know wasn't?

90
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,309
Speaker 1: I could still live my life.

91
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:34,623
Speaker 1: But when I first put on a pair of glasses and I could see it was like seeing through the matrix I was like, oh fuck and I basically wouldn't take those glasses off again Even though the doctor only told me to wear him like occasionally.

92
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:43,054
Speaker 1: I was like fuck that I want to see the guys get glasses or contacts or LASIK Get something.

93
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:45,322
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I do whatever the eye doctor tells you to.

94
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:49,519
Speaker 0: All right, so news news One of the smartest news.

95
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:54,675
Speaker 0: one of the smartest news there is okay John Carmack Our guy.

96
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,383
Speaker 0: he was at the quake con and doing.

97
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:57,890
Speaker 0: he was talking about pretty much everything.

98
00:06:58,592 --> 00:06:59,634
Speaker 0: But then there was.

99
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:05,369
Speaker 0: he announced he's going over to oculus the people with the goggles and he's gonna be the CTO over there.

100
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:08,043
Speaker 0: I think he's still doing stuff at it.

101
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,270
Speaker 0: I don't think he's quitting there.

102
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:16,900
Speaker 1: I gotta say the oculus rift isn't really there yet, but in terms of 90s style immersive VR coming back.

103
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,013
Speaker 1: It is the furthest along of any consumer thing I have ever.

104
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:27,018
Speaker 0: basically, you know big he's winding down his little, you know space Thingy his armadillo air whatever his rockets.

105
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:27,980
Speaker 0: Yeah all the time.

106
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,184
Speaker 0: He was spending on the Rockets.

107
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:32,696
Speaker 0: He's now gonna spend on the you know, the Oculus rift.

108
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,490
Speaker 1: I actually suddenly have a lot more interest in the oculus.

109
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the oculus.

110
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:44,428
Speaker 0: basically I'm still poo-pooing it But there are so many people going in on it and giving it the thumbs up and like lifting it up.

111
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:47,077
Speaker 0: It's like well Maybe right.

112
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:48,528
Speaker 0: It's like I'm still poo-pooing it.

113
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:53,570
Speaker 1: but Well, I can say one thing and I did this a couple of times as an experiment.

114
00:07:54,173 --> 00:08:03,649
Speaker 1: But what I did back when we were playing cs16 is I set my monitor up so it was basically like right in front of my eyeball like if I couldn't really see anything but the monitor.

115
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,190
Speaker 1: and Then what I did and I have myopia so my eye focus is really close like it's one kind of nice side effect.

116
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:10,455
Speaker 1: So it kind of worked.

117
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:15,874
Speaker 1: and then what I did is I put on an eyepatch on one of my eyes Mm-hmm, and you know what that did.

118
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:22,310
Speaker 1: it made everything feel so crazy real in 3d that it was almost disorienting to play counter-strike.

119
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:28,601
Speaker 0: Well, I remember the first time I played descent one of the first 3d games I played on an old DOS PC back in the 90s like 97 or 98 whatever.

120
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:33,138
Speaker 0: I was getting dizzy because that's a full.

121
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:34,443
Speaker 0: that's a real 3d game.

122
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:35,929
Speaker 0: Like you can go in every facing.

123
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:41,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not disoriented like dizzy disoriented like it was too real and I would flinch when thing like bumped into things.

124
00:08:41,832 --> 00:08:42,494
Speaker 0: Oh that could happen.

125
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:43,035
Speaker 0: I could see that.

126
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:44,301
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's like.

127
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:51,610
Speaker 0: yeah, and the oculus is like full HD Right, and I'm pretty sure it's 3d like, you know a movie is you never put it on in a con.

128
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,417
Speaker 0: I think I put it on at PAX for a few minutes.

129
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,927
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's 3d right like a movie which is.

130
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,100
Speaker 0: you know that is an advancement right.

131
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,249
Speaker 0: those the the Basically the virtual realities of the 90s were just TV screens and your eyeballs that weren't HD and weren't 3d.

132
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:09,843
Speaker 0: So it is a significant improvement, but it's still this Gigantic thing you put on your face.

133
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:12,835
Speaker 0: fine with that It's too big.

134
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:13,700
Speaker 1: Why is it too big?

135
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:16,822
Speaker 1: but smaller than my monitor maybe.

136
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:20,722
Speaker 0: But I mean you're wearing I mean Google Glass.

137
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:20,903
Speaker 0: was?

138
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:25,670
Speaker 0: he weighs nothing on your face But Google Glass you were outside if you were oculus rift outside your moron.

139
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:32,710
Speaker 1: Obviously though Imagine this I could sit down with just a TV tray on an airplane or a train.

140
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,538
Speaker 0: Yeah on an airplane or in the park.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,350
Speaker 0: You need power for I think needs to be plugged in though.

142
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:39,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not sure about that.

143
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,610
Speaker 1: It's not yeah what you think it's gonna just be powered from USB.

144
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,285
Speaker 0: It could have a big-ass battery that you're wearing on your face.

145
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,936
Speaker 0: Not really Yeah, I don't know.

146
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:48,800
Speaker 0: I'm still just.

147
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,610
Speaker 0: I mean I've seen this before.

148
00:09:50,750 --> 00:10:01,007
Speaker 0: I think this can get to a point to where like if they shave like a couple inches off the front You know and a couple pounds off of it, then it'd be like holy shit, but it's not.

149
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:01,890
Speaker 1: I think it's there.

150
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:02,515
Speaker 1: It's just.

151
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:03,929
Speaker 1: it's only there right now.

152
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:13,433
Speaker 1: It's at the level that the hardcore like like the people who bought the super nice TVs Before they were cheaper and a little bit better Like the.

153
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:20,339
Speaker 1: the people are on the edge of that curve either because they really care about their PC gaming or they really care about These VR sort of experiences.

154
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,285
Speaker 1: It's there for them.

155
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:21,909
Speaker 1: It's already there.

156
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,839
Speaker 1: It's only not there for the kind of super mass market.

157
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,974
Speaker 1: for the reasons who said I have been considering getting one Go for it.

158
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:33,734
Speaker 0: The other thing about the oculus is that if you look at the games that are hot right now It's like sure.

159
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:35,139
Speaker 0: This is great for some Counter-Strike.

160
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,062
Speaker 1: I see we're getting at.

161
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:38,350
Speaker 0: what does this do for you in your League of Legends?

162
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,898
Speaker 0: It's nothing nothing.

163
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:41,970
Speaker 0: It does but nothing right?

164
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:50,806
Speaker 0: So I think either a there aren't gonna be the games that are with the first-person perspective oculus or be.

165
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:58,206
Speaker 0: There will suddenly be a bunch of people making more first-person perspective games to support the two things.

166
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:03,444
Speaker 1: one if you Remade tie fighter, of course where you could look around the cockpit.

167
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,207
Speaker 0: Are you kidding me?

168
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:07,867
Speaker 1: Yeah All my money just take it.

169
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:12,503
Speaker 1: But to with a MOBA or a 2d game.

170
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,590
Speaker 1: a clever person could use it.

171
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,201
Speaker 1: Imagine this you put oculus on right.

172
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:17,550
Speaker 1: it tracks your head movements.

173
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:21,870
Speaker 0: They already have things you can buy that are head trackers that aren't God.

174
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:39,772
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, but I'm saying having the goggles there basically means that you have an infinite canvas to put information and monitors and things around you spatially to where you look to the left and you've got like all the stats for the Game and you look to the right and you've got your map and you look to the middle and you've got your guy in the Fighting.

175
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:40,717
Speaker 1: you look up and you've got it.

176
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:54,709
Speaker 1: You could zoom in and out you could do cool stuff But I don't see these games doing those kinds of things Because the people who play these games seem to get off having one oculus Having one oculus rift can simulate having like ten monitors.

177
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:58,386
Speaker 1: Yes You can basically be like I want a monitor floating right here.

178
00:11:58,406 --> 00:11:59,170
Speaker 1: at this angle.

179
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,521
Speaker 0: You can see all the judges doing everyday computing.

180
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:05,437
Speaker 0: You can see all your virtual desktops are basically Splayed out in different areas.

181
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:06,220
Speaker 0: Oh, that's Adam.

182
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,983
Speaker 1: That's a future.

183
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,990
Speaker 1: I sit down at my desk and there aren't any monitors.

184
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,585
Speaker 1: Yep, and the real future is I'm wearing Google Glass version 5.0.

185
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:15,210
Speaker 0: that I think here's the thing, right?

186
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,450
Speaker 0: I think we better to not have this oculus rift for the weight is on your head.

187
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:30,310
Speaker 0: I think it would be better to have it more like in Ghost in the Shell or when they sit down in that one room And the basically the eyeball things are attached to the wall or the floor and they just sort of lean into it more like

188
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:31,700
Speaker 1: But they can't move their head around.

189
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,988
Speaker 1: you lose that spatial dimension.

190
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,610
Speaker 0: They're not playing FPS is they're computing by looking into that.

191
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,333
Speaker 1: But they're right.

192
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:43,410
Speaker 1: the ghost in the shell gets into the idea that they're doing that for a different reason.

193
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,987
Speaker 1: they bring this up several times at least in standalone complex that they do that just because there's.

194
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:56,007
Speaker 1: they're Overloading data into the optic nerve because that area is just the highest resolution interface into a human that is relatively safe.

195
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:56,769
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

196
00:12:57,796 --> 00:12:59,210
Speaker 1: But yeah, I think there's different cases for it.

197
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:06,100
Speaker 1: I think there's the the overlay view and then there's the immersion view and I think we will need dedicated hardware for that until we Have brain interfaces.

198
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,190
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I guess I still think it would be nice to go to work and just sort of you know Sit comfortably in a thing where the thing is in my face.

199
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:17,070
Speaker 1: When we used to geek knives, you'd like lay backwards with your eyes closed, right?

200
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,669
Speaker 0: I just don't like the idea of the weight being on my head neck, right?

201
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,267
Speaker 1: Boom that I pull down and attached to my face but still tracks my movement.

202
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:26,889
Speaker 0: I could be cool.

203
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,854
Speaker 0: It would just be.

204
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:33,010
Speaker 0: sort of you know, that would be clumsy like having the freaking racing seat in your house.

205
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:39,285
Speaker 1: You know with the for the racing games For someone like us where this shit matters and is a central part of our life.

206
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,450
Speaker 1: I want the Darth Vader pod.

207
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,203
Speaker 1: Anyway, I just want to be in the Darth Vader pod.

208
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:48,410
Speaker 1: I pull my helmet down I stick my hand and the whole thing seals you in yeah, and I move everything.

209
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,589
Speaker 1: I'm just moving my arms and hands around and everything's haptic and visual and immersive, you know Darth Vader doesn't there?

210
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:58,515
Speaker 0: Not what you're describing though.

211
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:02,953
Speaker 1: he is moving his arms around I know but I'm saying I want the equivalent of that and I'd be fine With that.

212
00:14:03,315 --> 00:14:03,939
Speaker 0: I'd be fine.

213
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,510
Speaker 0: Are you gonna put that in your tiny apartment?

214
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:11,330
Speaker 1: I would fill this room with it great and you'd get to the huge and it wouldn't matter if you're physically next to me anymore.

215
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:13,359
Speaker 1: You can sit in the other room already doesn't matter.

216
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,705
Speaker 0: I'm not physically next exactly.

217
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:15,730
Speaker 1: So I just run an excellent.

218
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,634
Speaker 0: I don't even come here.

219
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:19,990
Speaker 0: Let's just Skype for now on cuz Skype is shit audio quality.

220
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:25,128
Speaker 1: So very briefly I want to point out a couple little things.

221
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:30,289
Speaker 1: one The Department of Transportation in the US is actually doing something really cool to the federal DoT.

222
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:39,779
Speaker 1: yes in the US and I highly recommend all of you pay attention to this because this is gonna come sooner than you realize and Everyone who says privacy stuff shut up.

223
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,830
Speaker 1: I'm more as much as I care about the NSA stuff.

224
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:48,530
Speaker 1: This stuff is separate in the sense that we need this regardless of if we fix the NSA stuff.

225
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:56,872
Speaker 1: They want to standardize on the in the nation the way that cars communicate with each other and with the road reason point.

226
00:14:56,953 --> 00:15:09,850
Speaker 1: imagine if all the cars on the road were constantly generating telemetry data and traffic data and Automatically updating a standard interface for GPS direction navigation things to reroute cars if there's a problem.

227
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:14,098
Speaker 1: So if there's an accident cars Immediately are rerouted to alternate roads.

228
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,462
Speaker 0: This is your favorite thing.

229
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:19,113
Speaker 0: fixed protocol for cars exactly exactly I I.

230
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:36,510
Speaker 1: yeah 39 equals 3. so the other news I like to talk about is that there's been a rash of dark mail or silent mail or Secure email services going down either because of secret government bullshit that they can't talk about and wall.

231
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,619
Speaker 1: I think these people should fight so far.

232
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,149
Speaker 1: I saw one so another one shut down.

233
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:45,063
Speaker 1: They didn't say if it was because of the gut because it's a rash.

234
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:45,705
Speaker 1: Yes.

235
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:47,170
Speaker 1: I think there's gonna be more.

236
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:59,270
Speaker 1: I think what's going to see more spring up than shut down true, but the ones that spring up have to be Technologically secure not relying upon central servers doing one and mega has kept mega up.

237
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,788
Speaker 0: So there you go.

238
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:13,545
Speaker 1: I guess I bring this up only because those of you who are worried about privacy and all these issues These are little too little data points you can use to argue with other people as to why this NSA stuff is kind of toxic.

239
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:27,690
Speaker 1: because if the Government can tell someone to shut down something that has perfectly legitimate uses because someone might use it for nefarious purposes and simultaneously That person is not allowed to even talk about what happened and we don't even know if they fight it or not.

240
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:32,383
Speaker 1: I can't really fault the person for not fighting it because they're kind of.

241
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:35,734
Speaker 1: that's kind of like going up against the Stasi like yeah He's a guy who's fighting it.

242
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:36,779
Speaker 0: He just can't talk about it.

243
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:39,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how do you know if you thought it then?

244
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,475
Speaker 0: He's saying he fought it.

245
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, something happened.

246
00:16:42,244 --> 00:16:43,390
Speaker 0: I can't talk about but I'm fighting.

247
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,900
Speaker 1: And things of the day I'll let you guys know right now.

248
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,895
Speaker 1: you might have heard some clicking for the last few minutes.

249
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:59,372
Speaker 1: the The mixer the geek night's mixer might have just died.

250
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,575
Speaker 0: You don't hear any clicking right now.

251
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:01,558
Speaker 1: There's no more clicking.

252
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:02,100
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

253
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:11,657
Speaker 1: so we have plugged directly into my fire studio interface for the time being and We'll see if the audio sounds different cuz I'm gonna have to master everything very differently now.

254
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,567
Speaker 1: And yeah, I have to buy a new mixer.

255
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:15,832
Speaker 0: We'll see what happens there.

256
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:16,714
Speaker 0: We should kickstart it.

257
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:21,880
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, so thing of the day.

258
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:26,826
Speaker 0: We've been waiting a long time, but finally It's gonna happen.

259
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:27,849
Speaker 0: It's gonna happen.

260
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:38,041
Speaker 0: the English version of Hatsune Miku V3 English using Vocaloid 3 is now slated to be available for download on August 31st 2013.

261
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,007
Speaker 1: the I'm actually kind of excited about this.

262
00:17:41,248 --> 00:17:52,656
Speaker 0: the bundle with vocal editor Pia Pro Studio vsti and Presonus studio one artist Pia Pro Edition and over 200 virtual instruments.

263
00:17:52,877 --> 00:18:00,724
Speaker 0: Hopefully including the swan For immediate music production goes for 150 US dollars.

264
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:06,220
Speaker 0: that's basically zero for software like that for basically software that allow you to make all the musics.

265
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:08,368
Speaker 0: I don't know how to make the musics.

266
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:09,714
Speaker 0: I don't have the music skills.

267
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:11,260
Speaker 0: My music skills are very low.

268
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:22,359
Speaker 0: I mean, they're higher than you know zero but because I did a lot of musics when I was in elementary middle high schools But I haven't done any really since then unless you count like guitar here or DDR.

269
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:25,720
Speaker 0: So my music skills are pretty low.

270
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:30,080
Speaker 0: So I feel like if I bought it for 150 it would be sort of like up not using it for anything.

271
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,327
Speaker 0: What a waste of money that was.

272
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,560
Speaker 1: I could buy it, but I don't have a good project for it.

273
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:42,588
Speaker 1: I haven't written a long time and yes, I could transcribe Existing popular songs and do what everyone else is gonna do with it But I still feel like I should buy it.

274
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,034
Speaker 1: Anyway, you know we could do.

275
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,772
Speaker 1: we could use it Cleverly in geek nights, maybe yeah, I'll make the new geek.

276
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:49,556
Speaker 0: that's theme song.

277
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:50,540
Speaker 0: Miku will sing it for us.

278
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll use it as we could use it to add a third host.

279
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,595
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's some demo videos here on YouTube.

280
00:18:57,615 --> 00:18:58,480
Speaker 0: You can hear what it sounds like.

281
00:18:58,662 --> 00:18:59,637
Speaker 1: You know we could use it for this.

282
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,665
Speaker 1: It sounds kind of dumb.

283
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,140
Speaker 1: we could have it every time we want to quote something from an article.

284
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,857
Speaker 1: Just have Miku sing it on the show instead.

285
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:08,176
Speaker 1: Mmm, that might be really annoying really quickly.

286
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:08,799
Speaker 0: We'll see.

287
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:12,584
Speaker 0: But yeah Awesomeness times a million.

288
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:16,560
Speaker 1: All right, so this is a cool and creepy art installation.

289
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:35,500
Speaker 1: Someone took not one not two daddy three PP but a matrix of Three by I gotta expand this window to see how big it is three by five Teddy Ruxpin's 15 Teddy Ruxpin's and made an art installation where they just kind of say creepy stuff.

290
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,036
Speaker 0: Well, isn't he just a cassette player?

291
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,559
Speaker 0: So it's basically you're hanging a teddy bear shaped cassette player on the wall 15 of them and having them play.

292
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,190
Speaker 1: Teddy Ruxpin did more than just play tapes.

293
00:19:45,231 --> 00:20:00,180
Speaker 1: Teddy Ruxpin on one of the audio channels had someone telling a story and on the other audio channel had command and control for moving his eyes moving his mouth or Making another accessory another guy you could get that would connect to him also move around and do stuff.

294
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:06,192
Speaker 0: So basically it was had stereo audio but a mono speaker and the right or the left would have the.

295
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:09,770
Speaker 0: yeah when I was what he was saying it would just play It over the one speaker and the other.

296
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,019
Speaker 1: if you played the other side It would play this kind of like buzzing noise.

297
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:18,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other channel would just sort of you know play data that would make him move.

298
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:26,821
Speaker 1: exactly I bring it up one cuz it's kind of cool and two people are really into like chip bending or all these sort of you know Cool Things.

299
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:28,286
Speaker 0: you wouldn't even need a cassette tape.

300
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:31,215
Speaker 0: you'd be better off with sticking an Arduino inside.

301
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:32,740
Speaker 1: that appears to be what they did here.

302
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:42,676
Speaker 0: Okay, and just controlling him directly without shitty cassette tape exactly and then playing one audio track on speakers nearby With an mp3 or something.

303
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:53,120
Speaker 1: Yeah I just I bring this up only because it's kind of a cool way to use an old technology and to Whether or not you know or care who Teddy Ruxpin is I think says a lot about what year you were born.

304
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,712
Speaker 0: I should do the same thing with fucking glow worms glow worm and Teddy Ruxpin together.

305
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:58,358
Speaker 1: You gotta get every glow worm.

306
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:00,082
Speaker 0: is my boy Really?

307
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:01,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, you and glow worm.

308
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:02,472
Speaker 0: I like glow worm.

309
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:03,456
Speaker 1: I never like glow worm.

310
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,260
Speaker 0: Oh, it was the best.

311
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:05,380
Speaker 1: I was never a fan of me.

312
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:07,469
Speaker 1: I might have been a fan of glow worm in my pre.

313
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:17,158
Speaker 0: I had this awesome toy where there was basically a board with all these holes in it and he had a pen and the pen had a glow worm on top and you would put The pen in the holes and even put in the right hole to glow him light up.

314
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:24,277
Speaker 1: So yeah, but also you could just put other cassettes and Teddy Ruxpin and he would just kind of play him But he wouldn't move wouldn't really move.

315
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:27,308
Speaker 1: No So yeah, yeah, that's all I got.

316
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,332
Speaker 0: He was just a cassette player.

317
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,120
Speaker 0: All right time for the meta.

318
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,726
Speaker 1: The book of the book is Stazzyland.

319
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:33,669
Speaker 1: I'm mostly done with it.

320
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,800
Speaker 1: It's pretty good pretty relevant NSA scary spy shit.

321
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,027
Speaker 0: Pax prime is real soon the end of the month.

322
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,715
Speaker 1: We are presenting on Monday at noon in the Wolfman theater.

Speaker 0: We're gonna enjoy a bunch of packs and then sort of on this last lazy day before the omega-thon finale We're gonna do a panel.

326
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:54,480

333
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:17,930
Speaker 0: They are easy for you to find including one of them that is often forgotten our email newsletter Which has content that isn't really in other things.

334
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:22,729
Speaker 0: as I write a lot of stuff in there such as a Q&A That's easy where our Q&A section is gone.

335
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:26,866
Speaker 0: So if you want to ask us something and us to answer it That's really all in the newsletter now.

336
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:30,939
Speaker 0: So email us geek nights from a crew calm and then look for another newsletter.

337
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:37,430
Speaker 0: soon I'll mail one probably this month before Pax happens and you might be answered in there.

338
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:42,303
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright, that's the end of meta moment.

339
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:44,666
Speaker 1: So, uh Scott got Google Glass.

340
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:49,126
Speaker 1: I did I don't yet mostly because I Would really like to get the water.

341
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:50,551
Speaker 1: I can put prescription glasses in it.

342
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:52,820
Speaker 1: Yep, and that's not available yet.

343
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:58,680
Speaker 0: Well, you know actually it comes with the shields and shades is what they call it.

344
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:09,459
Speaker 0: It's basically sunglasses and also a clear glass that you can use just to protect your eyes if you say Biking and it in the night or something And they just sort of snap in in between the nose thingies.

345
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:10,870
Speaker 1: Yep No, I would with

346
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:20,476
Speaker 0: your pile of money You could get someone to make you prescription glasses that have like that little connector Thingy that would go in where the shades and shields go

347
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:24,553
Speaker 1: now that is true But that would be more money than I'm willing to pay especially already

348
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:25,176
Speaker 0: spending $1,500 in the gas.

349
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:31,737
Speaker 1: There are pretty good rumors that it'll be available more generally with the prescription glass option.

350
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:32,540
Speaker 1: Just kind of working.

351
00:23:33,864 --> 00:23:35,139
Speaker 1: Not that too far out.

352
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,860
Speaker 0: Yeah The rumor that's going around now is that it'll be available by the end of the year for 300 bucks and you know what?

353
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,086
Speaker 0: That's kind of annoying because I just spent 1500.

354
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:45,954
Speaker 0: It's been five times that right?

355
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:50,820
Speaker 0: not the early adopter tax Yeah, but I mean that's a huge early adopter tax.

356
00:23:51,302 --> 00:23:54,900
Speaker 0: It was like oh I paid five hundred and they paid three hundred or I even if I paid seven.

357
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:58,803
Speaker 1: I don't think the three hundred dollars is a legitimate rumor even if it is.

358
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:04,631
Speaker 0: I would be okay with it if because basically if you look at the updates that Google Glass gets they're all labeled as like.

359
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:07,233
Speaker 0: Let me look for a second.

360
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:07,879
Speaker 0: I'm loading it up.

361
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:13,136
Speaker 0: I'm currently running xe8, which is Explorer Edition 8, right?

362
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:21,162
Speaker 0: So if I continue to get Explorer Edition updates and everyone else gets sort of like less updates then it's like oh, okay I get it.

363
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:22,271
Speaker 0: I'm an Explorer Edition.

364
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,460
Speaker 0: I'm basically in the beta.

365
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,346
Speaker 0: I always get you know the sort of like.

366
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:29,059
Speaker 0: if you pay $100 to Apple to be a developer you keep getting more.

367
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:29,400
Speaker 0: you get.

368
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:35,620
Speaker 0: You know, you're using iOS whatever it is right now the new version, you know Because you have to make apps for it before it comes out.

369
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,432
Speaker 0: So you get the new version early when it's beta.

370
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:43,179
Speaker 0: that would be okay That would be yeah I spent more money on it and I basically ahead of the curve on my Google Glass.

371
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:47,277
Speaker 0: That is something I'm you know would not be upset if they even if they came out with $300 Google Glass.

372
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,900
Speaker 0: Also, you got to consider, you know, those shades and shields came in a separate thing.

373
00:24:53,683 --> 00:24:55,310
Speaker 0: You know, they're gonna charge extra for that shit.

374
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,820
Speaker 0: I basically got the full set like a fully loaded car.

375
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:04,180
Speaker 0: I think if you buy Google Glass at retail all that other stuff is gonna be like add-ons that cost more money.

376
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:15,813
Speaker 0: the only thing that was actually in the package with the Google Glass was like the carrying case and a USB cable and Not much else, right?

377
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:17,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much all you got.

378
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:22,060
Speaker 0: So everything else that you would want for Google Glass is gonna be probably separate monies.

379
00:25:22,642 --> 00:25:32,236
Speaker 0: So if you know, even if it is 300 if they charge like 50 bucks each shades and shields, it's really 400 You know, so hmm plus they could charge a lot more for that.

380
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:33,160
Speaker 0: sunglasses are expensive.

381
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, they could charge a hundred each for those who knows what they're gonna do.

382
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:38,713
Speaker 1: So it's hard to say what'll happen with that where I'm just gonna wait.

383
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:40,140
Speaker 1: I'm in no rush right now.

384
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:49,935
Speaker 0: Well, I'm in a rush, but I'm not in that much of a rush all right, so a lot of people now that I have the Google Glass and I've been using it for Week about yeah, I got it last Wednesday.

385
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:53,114
Speaker 0: I think yeah last Wednesday We can pretty much talk about.

386
00:25:53,155 --> 00:26:01,280
Speaker 0: a lot of people Really don't understand what it currently is what it is capable of what it does because they haven't had it.

387
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,269
Speaker 0: They haven't really read tech articles that really describe it.

388
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:08,080
Speaker 0: Even those articles don't really, you know fully explain it.

389
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:14,149
Speaker 0: Like I say it's not an augmented reality overlay Obviously right, so here's what Google Glass is.

390
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:17,400
Speaker 0: so it weighs about as much as glasses, right?

391
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:21,261
Speaker 0: It's not really bothersome to wear It's.

392
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:28,200
Speaker 0: and what it does is it basically puts a little tiny screen up in the top right corner of your vision, right?

393
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,285
Speaker 0: it's in your peripheral vision not in your main vision and most of the time it's just off.

394
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:43,287
Speaker 0: and when it's off basically and your peripheral vision is a little blurry spot where the piece of Glasses and that's all it does and only when you turn it on Which I'm just did.

395
00:26:43,307 --> 00:26:46,780
Speaker 1: I want so observations from someone around someone with the Google Glass.

396
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:50,679
Speaker 1: You will see Google Glass people periodically just jerking their net back like whoop.

397
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,747
Speaker 0: Yeah one way there are two ways to turn it on.

398
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:59,511
Speaker 0: one way to turn on is to jerk your neck backwards to look up at The sky and you can set the angle of sort of attack.

399
00:26:59,893 --> 00:27:01,859
Speaker 0: So I said I left mine to the default of 30 degrees.

400
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,999
Speaker 0: I tried lowering it because it wasn't working but then that was too much.

401
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:06,891
Speaker 0: I put it at 20. that wasn't good.

402
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:08,380
Speaker 0: So I put it back at 30 and it's okay.

403
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:14,439
Speaker 0: And basically I tilt my head back 30 degrees and it turns on right and I can now see basically a clock.

404
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,828
Speaker 0: Great it's 629.

405
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:18,390
Speaker 1: that was worth it.

406
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:18,712
Speaker 1: Isn't it?

407
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:19,034
Speaker 1: That is 629.

408
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:20,623
Speaker 1: That is correct One.

409
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:22,320
Speaker 1: you have a very expensive pocket watch.

410
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,131
Speaker 0: It is a very one thing Google Glass is is a watch.

411
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:31,298
Speaker 0: if you have a watch and you have Google Glass You don't need it and it prevents you from a having anything on your wrist.

412
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,534
Speaker 1: instead You have something on your head, but you have a pebble on your wrist.

413
00:27:34,815 --> 00:27:35,619
Speaker 0: I don't have it on now.

414
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:39,986
Speaker 0: The pebble watch is completely Unnecessary if you have Google Glass.

415
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,171
Speaker 1: I'll buy it from you for a dollar.

416
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:42,878
Speaker 0: No, they're mute now.

417
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:43,501
Speaker 1: 250.

418
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:46,112
Speaker 0: No, they're mutually exclusive devices, right and two.

419
00:27:46,152 --> 00:27:47,517
Speaker 0: you don't need to take your phone out of your pocket.

420
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:48,100
Speaker 0: Okay?

421
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:50,164
Speaker 0: So it's a wristwatch.

422
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:50,867
Speaker 0: That's one thing.

423
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:53,900
Speaker 0: it is right and all this is a little tiny rectangular screen.

424
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:57,260
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like, you know how you have a second monitor on your computer.

425
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,740
Speaker 0: It's like having a second monitor on your phone, but it's just always there.

426
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,460
Speaker 0: You don't have to pull your phone out of your pocket and look away, right?

427
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:03,983
Speaker 0: It's just there.

428
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:06,580
Speaker 0: the other way to turn it on is to tap the side of it.

429
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,734
Speaker 0: The front right side of it is basically this touchscreen.

430
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:18,645
Speaker 0: It's not a touchscreen it's a touchpad and it's sort of a long stick shaped touchpad and it only really has Four different things you can do.

431
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:24,059
Speaker 0: you can swipe forward swipe back right and that basically scrolls left and right or up and down.

432
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:32,040
Speaker 0: You can swipe downwards which is sort of like quickly and that is sort of like dismiss Which is like pushing the home button on your iPhone, right?

433
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:39,065
Speaker 0: So like go back go back or turn off and then you can also tap it and that's like clicking like select that option That I just looked at.

434
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,071
Speaker 0: select that option.

435
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:41,620
Speaker 0: All right, that's that's what that's all about.

436
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:46,040
Speaker 0: There are some apps where you do a two finger scroll like the web browser.

437
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,285
Speaker 0: That's pretty rare though.

438
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:56,151
Speaker 0: It's mostly just the one finger swipe forward swipe back down and tap Okay, so what do you use it for right now?

439
00:28:56,412 --> 00:28:58,780
Speaker 0: right now, this is the sad part of Google Glass.

440
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:04,129
Speaker 0: I can't use it for all that much because a Doesn't support Google Apps.

441
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,080
Speaker 0: It only supports regular Gmail.

442
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,000
Speaker 0: So if your Gmail account is at gmail.com then you're all set with Google Glass.

443
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,032
Speaker 0: You can use your Google+ and all that stuff.

444
00:29:13,113 --> 00:29:14,078
Speaker 0: I have to turn the Google+ off.

445
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:26,913
Speaker 0: I don't have to but if I Google+ and hung out and did all that stuff with my Google Glass it would be hanging out with my at gmail.com account or Posting to my geek G+ on my at gmail.com account.

446
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:28,420
Speaker 1: I'm not Google.

447
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,033
Speaker 0: I don't have anyone in my circles on my at gmail.com account.

448
00:29:32,073 --> 00:29:34,060
Speaker 1: Google, Google, Google, Moses.

449
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:37,398
Speaker 0: They always fuck the people using Google Apps.

450
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:42,440
Speaker 1: guys We who use Google Apps are your hardest core users.

451
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,479
Speaker 0: Yeah You should give the hardest core people to shit First not after everyone else or in the very least make it to where the apps.

452
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,113
Speaker 1: people Can enable that stuff if they want to.

453
00:29:52,194 --> 00:29:56,835
Speaker 0: even if it's off by default There is an option in Google Apps to be like give me the beta shit.

454
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:57,980
Speaker 0: if someone checked that box.

455
00:29:58,504 --> 00:29:59,919
Speaker 0: Give them the beta shit.

456
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:07,024
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I know for a fact a lot of nerds like us use Google Apps because we have a real domain But we really the

457
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:11,141
Speaker 0: only reason I use it is because I want my email address to not be at gmail.com But

458
00:30:11,262 --> 00:30:12,025
Speaker 1: I want to use

459
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:13,068
Speaker 0: all of Google services.

460
00:30:13,088 --> 00:30:16,220
Speaker 0: I want every Gmail Google service there is possible.

461
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,088
Speaker 1: I've basically doubled down on Google.

462
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:33,042
Speaker 0: I use Google for pretty much everything I do on the internet except Storing and sharing pictures yep, but yes because I'm use an apps account, and I can't link that to my You know Google glass I can't do the hangouts And I can't do there.

463
00:30:33,062 --> 00:30:40,471
Speaker 0: what the hangouts do is basically it's hangout and you can even do a video hangout where they see What you see right and you can do an audio hangout where you.

464
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:41,496
Speaker 0: this is a microphone.

465
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:44,731
Speaker 0: when you talk it hears you And you can I guess do it.

466
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:45,860
Speaker 0: Maybe a text hangout?

467
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:54,057
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if it does text to speech to text for a text hangout, but yeah You can hang out with it if you have that enabled and you can share things to g+ with it.

468
00:30:54,137 --> 00:31:00,481
Speaker 1: so one thing I notice You seem to be taking a lot of candid photographs that you wouldn't have otherwise taken because you always just kind of have it on.

469
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:08,009
Speaker 0: yeah, that is the one thing that I really do with it a lot is because it's not hooked up to my g+ and Because I turned off the Twitter app.

470
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:10,220
Speaker 0: even because the Twitter app is really annoying.

471
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:14,740
Speaker 0: It keeps showing you all these tweets, and it seemed to have randomly selected like four people.

472
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:22,765
Speaker 0: I was following and showed me all their tweets all the time and kept even beeping and saying hey tweet someone tweeted But it didn't show me all my tweets It just chose some people.

473
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:26,600
Speaker 0: and I'm like why did you choose those people and stop bothering me with these tweets?

474
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,106
Speaker 0: I just want to be able to tweet.

475
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:30,216
Speaker 0: I don't want to see tweets in my Google Glass.

476
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:31,060
Speaker 0: That's annoying as hell.

477
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:32,379
Speaker 0: So I turned off Twitter.

478
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:35,940
Speaker 0: So what I did is it made a tumblr because it also works with tumblr.

479
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:42,978
Speaker 0: So I made a tumblr just for Google Glass and I said I will share all the things From my glass to this tumblr.

480
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:49,786
Speaker 0: now You could make that another tweet, and then I used ifttt to make the tumblr Tumblr auto tweets on its own.

481
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:51,232
Speaker 0: Oh, well I used ifttt.

482
00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:51,855
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll go back.

483
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,020
Speaker 1: You can just do it in tumblr.

484
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,568
Speaker 0: I'll just turn that off and do it in time.

485
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:58,366
Speaker 1: if you notice how every morning at the exact same time There's I make a single tweet.

486
00:31:58,427 --> 00:31:59,431
Speaker 1: That is just whatever.

487
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:00,978
Speaker 0: I thought you might have been using ifttt.

488
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:11,057
Speaker 1: Nope I actually don't have an account on ifttt anymore because once they got rid of the other direction interface for Twitter Yeah, that was the most useful thing they had.

489
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:11,781
Speaker 1: all I used I have.

490
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:14,090
Speaker 0: that was Twitter's fault for removing that was.

491
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:22,308
Speaker 1: I would take everything anyone ever tweeted at me And if it had a link in it, I made myself a feed of those links in delicious Yep, and that was super useful.

492
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:24,600
Speaker 0: But anyway, so yeah taking photos.

493
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,994
Speaker 0: It is a camera obviously Google Glass right and there's two ways to take photos.

494
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:35,278
Speaker 0: is you can when you turn it on You can say okay glass and that brings up the voice activated menu, which works great And that's good if you're carrying stuff.

495
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:37,369
Speaker 0: but there's also the button you can press.

496
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:39,197
Speaker 0: there's a button on top of it and you press the button.

497
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:39,819
Speaker 0: it takes a photo.

498
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,180
Speaker 0: if You hold the button it takes a video and I just use the button a lot and You don't have to take your phone out of your pocket, right?

499
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,940
Speaker 0: Cuz think about if you see something and it's like for example I was walking down the street and those a Maserati.

500
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:54,014
Speaker 0: I'd take my phone out of my pocket aim it at the thing by.

501
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:55,140
Speaker 0: that time is gone, right?

502
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,844
Speaker 0: But instead I guys go.

503
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:56,710
Speaker 0: boop got it.

504
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:58,019
Speaker 0: boop got it.

505
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,139
Speaker 0: So even though the pictures are kind of shitty you can get a lot of pictures and stuff like that.

506
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:07,280
Speaker 0: That you can't you wouldn't normally get just because the camera is always out.

507
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,380
Speaker 1: Oh, I got this great picture of me looking really sad playing Hanabi at the show.

508
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:12,408
Speaker 0: That was a sad game of.

509
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:13,679
Speaker 0: Hanabi was the saddest.

510
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:16,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I tend to you know, I'm like, hey, this is kind of.

511
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:20,767
Speaker 0: I'll just take pictures of pretty much every sort of moderately interesting you know.

512
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:24,858
Speaker 0: moment and Tumble them into this tumbler and see what that's all about.

513
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:26,987
Speaker 0: the way the videos work is you?

514
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:34,935
Speaker 0: basically if you tell it to take a video it starts taking a video and Then it goes for 10 seconds, then it stops and then you can send the video can't?

515
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:36,826
Speaker 0: there's no YouTube at all Which is annoying.

516
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:38,738
Speaker 0: it only goes to like G plus and stuff like that.

517
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:43,293
Speaker 0: But if you tell it to if you tap it while it's videoing the video will.

518
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:47,930
Speaker 0: the video limit will be removed and it'll video Forever until you stop it or the battery runs out.

519
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,480
Speaker 0: The battery has been lasting pretty good.

520
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:55,904
Speaker 0: I'm basically charging it the same times that I would charge my phone, you know when I'm at work I don't put it on.

521
00:33:55,985 --> 00:33:58,114
Speaker 0: I'm not sitting with my at my desk wearing it.

522
00:33:58,134 --> 00:33:59,360
Speaker 0: That's pointless, right?

523
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,919
Speaker 1: See I plan to wear it all the time because I wear glasses.

524
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:09,858
Speaker 0: I wear pretty much when I get up from my desk or when I'm walking around town or you know Pretty much all those times but I don't wear it in the shower.

525
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:16,935
Speaker 0: or You know when I'm sitting at my desk and there's a computer in front of me There's no point in wearing the Google Glass with its current functionality.

526
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:22,880
Speaker 0: There could be Functionality for it that would enhance your sitting at the computer experience, but none of that exists.

527
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:24,385
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll make some.

528
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:25,491
Speaker 1: we need or we need.

529
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:28,199
Speaker 1: you know, we've always whenever a thing came out We're like, oh we should write some apps.

530
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:32,576
Speaker 1: We need to be the ones right glass apps because what I see people I'm gonna be writing some soon.

531
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:36,411
Speaker 1: what I see people working On or saying they want now is all bullshit.

532
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:38,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know what to do for glass.

533
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,139
Speaker 1: I've been thinking about this for most of my life exactly.

534
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:46,591
Speaker 0: So, yeah, so You know, I only wear it like.

535
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:47,639
Speaker 0: I don't wear it sitting at my desk.

536
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,485
Speaker 0: So it's charging.

537
00:34:48,605 --> 00:34:51,260
Speaker 0: so it you know between you know, the morning and the afternoon.

538
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,134
Speaker 0: It's like it doesn't really die, but the battery does not last long.

539
00:34:54,154 --> 00:34:57,251
Speaker 0: if you heavily use it Like I'm sure it packs it's gonna die.

540
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:00,705
Speaker 0: It's not gonna make it to the Micro USB, right?

541
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:02,132
Speaker 0: It's mmm.

542
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:03,840
Speaker 0: Yeah micro USB the same as the Kindle.

543
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:07,160
Speaker 1: Could you just wear an energy around your neck and have it plugged in?

544
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,660
Speaker 0: You thought you could put an energy in your pocket and have a cable going all the way up to the side of your head.

545
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:12,644
Speaker 0: And yes, that would.

546
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:13,568
Speaker 0: that will I will.

547
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:16,926
Speaker 1: I think one of the first things I'll do when I get it is try to rig Something like that up.

548
00:35:16,946 --> 00:35:17,792
Speaker 1: that isn't annoying.

549
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:24,280
Speaker 0: if you just get a long Micro USB cable put the energy in your pocket and if the cables long enough now if I just know no that wouldn't work.

550
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,966
Speaker 1: If you just did that what?

551
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:27,069
Speaker 1: where is the?

552
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,227
Speaker 0: the cable would be no more annoying than a headphone cable that goes to your pocket Your phone with your pocket.

553
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:33,100
Speaker 1: would it stick out the bottom of glass or the side?

554
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,357
Speaker 1: Let me look because if it sticks out the side There's no good because it would put it sticks out the bottom right here.

555
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:41,571
Speaker 0: So basically it would be like having a one headphone cable.

556
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:43,700
Speaker 0: Just go past your ear, right?

557
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,912
Speaker 1: It's your pocket cuz a lot of people make the mistake of plugging USB cables into things where there will be.

558
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:55,311
Speaker 0: Yeah, no go straight into the bottom.

559
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:58,425
Speaker 0: so it's all good in that respect Let's see.

560
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:00,320
Speaker 0: What else is there to say about glass?

561
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,000
Speaker 0: Oh, so some of the thing the apps that exists for it, right?

562
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,803
Speaker 0: So you can do.

563
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:07,414
Speaker 0: you can get Google now on it and the Google now.

564
00:36:07,514 --> 00:36:08,760
Speaker 0: it works for me, right?

565
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,047
Speaker 0: But the problem is that again It's using this other Google accounts.

566
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:17,245
Speaker 0: the Google now doesn't have enough information about me to really do it Now is like the best, right?

567
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:23,978
Speaker 0: Basically you would love it because you're basically your Google but your Google now is attached to your account.

568
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,792
Speaker 0: Yeah But basically it's your Google now, so it does all that stuff.

569
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:30,981
Speaker 0: Mostly what the Google now does for me is weather.

570
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:33,249
Speaker 0: it gives me the weather and it gives me.

571
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:40,560
Speaker 0: it always tells me what restaurants are nearby so I can just be like Boop and there's the nearby restaurants with their ratings and I can just call them right.

572
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:47,949
Speaker 1: I have a feeling if I have glass I'll use now a lot more because I only use now when I pull out my phone And think I'm gonna look at my phone.

573
00:36:48,149 --> 00:36:49,657
Speaker 0: Google now is basically incredible.

574
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:50,300
Speaker 0: the Google glass.

575
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:57,040
Speaker 0: I just don't have it really Using its full potential because it doesn't have enough data about me because it's using the wrong Gmail account.

576
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:05,680
Speaker 0: The other real thing that people don't understand about Google glass Is that other than being a wristwatch pebble watch replacement in that you?

577
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,867
Speaker 0: notifications come to your face and you don't take your phone out of your pocket and it's a you can see the time without taking Your phone in your pocket is?

578
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:15,480
Speaker 0: it is also a Bluetooth headset on crack.

579
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,567
Speaker 1: It's got that bone microphone.

580
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:27,527
Speaker 0: Well, so the bone microphone is Interesting because it's kind of incredible how there's nothing in your ear, but you can hear this noise as it makes But it can really only do beeps and bloops.

581
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:30,275
Speaker 0: It's really shitty at doing voice or music.

582
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,180
Speaker 0: basically awful at doing voice or music.

583
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:33,353
Speaker 0: I tried to make a phone call with it.

584
00:37:33,373 --> 00:37:36,263
Speaker 0: It's like Right.

585
00:37:36,363 --> 00:37:39,235
Speaker 0: I mean you could I could tell what they were saying, but no you use.

586
00:37:39,315 --> 00:37:42,560
Speaker 0: don't use it for phone calls But it is a Bluetooth headset.

587
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:47,140
Speaker 0: So someone calls you you see who's calling you in your eyeball, right?

588
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,240
Speaker 0: You tab to pick up then you just talk because the mic has a microphone in it and it has the bone speaker, right?

589
00:37:54,342 --> 00:37:55,860
Speaker 0: So there you go, right?

590
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,362
Speaker 0: It's it's.

591
00:37:56,503 --> 00:37:59,059
Speaker 0: it can even do video calls and and all kinds of you know.

592
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:02,400
Speaker 0: So you see that guy walking around with a Bluetooth headset?

593
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,219
Speaker 0: You don't really see that guy anymore, but Google glass is that it's pretty much the best one there is on earth.

594
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:14,480
Speaker 1: Oh So the other thing that you haven't pointed out because you have an iPhone you don't have access to everything.

595
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true, right?

596
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,618
Speaker 0: So there are some things that Google glass does that I can't do because I have an iPhone.

597
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:22,228
Speaker 1: for example Isn't it GPS and accelerometer data?

598
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,212
Speaker 0: I don't know.

599
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:23,854
Speaker 0: You might be able to.

600
00:38:23,975 --> 00:38:25,400
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about accelerometer data.

601
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,694
Speaker 1: That's what I read when I was reading the GPS.

602
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:28,600
Speaker 0: in the menu.

603
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:32,517
Speaker 0: It says like get directions and then whenever I choose that let me actually choose it right now.

604
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,540
Speaker 0: Okay I Get direction, so I chose get directions.

605
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:40,308
Speaker 0: Directions not available.

606
00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:43,060
Speaker 0: connect to my glass for Android for GPS service.

607
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:49,870
Speaker 0: So basically if an Android phone you run this my glass app on your Android phone right the Google Glass connects to it.

608
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:55,310
Speaker 0: the Android phone does all the GPS work and Sends the data of what to tell you to the glass.

609
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:58,180
Speaker 0: and the glass tells you, you know, turn left turn right?

610
00:38:58,241 --> 00:38:59,030
Speaker 0: Whatever, so, I don't know.

611
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,940
Speaker 0: I'm sure it works great.

612
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:03,252
Speaker 0: I just can't use it because I have an iPhone and I don't have an Android phone.

613
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:05,632
Speaker 1: doesn't the glass also have to tether via Wi-Fi?

614
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:11,275
Speaker 0: Okay so Google glass has Wi-Fi in it and it will always use Wi-Fi if it can find a Wi-Fi.

615
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:14,259
Speaker 0: and the way you add Wi-Fi is to it is pretty clever.

616
00:39:14,723 --> 00:39:14,884
Speaker 1: It'll

617
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:35,800
Speaker 0: always try to use an open Wi-Fi if it can right But if it can't then what you do is you go to the my glass app and which works on mobile or the website basically right and you type in the Wi-Fi credentials and then it shows a QR code and you look at it and It sends the Wi-Fi credentials into the Google Glass via QR code and then the Google Glass will now try to connect to that Wi-Fi.

618
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,627
Speaker 0: So it's on Wi-Fi right now in your house.

619
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,540
Speaker 0: So it really it is a standalone device.

620
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:43,340
Speaker 0: It gets its internet from Wi-Fi wherever you are.

621
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:53,118
Speaker 0: But you really need to have a phone to go with it because otherwise the Bluetooth headset part of it is useless Obviously right for making calls and doing all that sort of stuff.

622
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:57,298
Speaker 0: and B You want to tether it to your phone so that you can have data anywhere.

623
00:39:57,398 --> 00:40:01,093
Speaker 0: Otherwise Having it only do its thing when there's Wi-Fi nearby.

624
00:40:01,113 --> 00:40:02,960
Speaker 0: It's rarely gonna do its thing.

625
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,589
Speaker 0: It'll basically be turned into a useless wristwatch.

626
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:08,800
Speaker 1: if you want to try out the direction sometimes just borrow my Nexus 4.

627
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,290
Speaker 1: I mean the GPS data works even without a data connection.

628
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:13,037
Speaker 0: install the my glass app on there.

629
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:13,358
Speaker 1: I will.

630
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,086
Speaker 0: okay What else?

631
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:21,256
Speaker 0: Oh you add contacts to it So you can add basically 10 contacts to speed dial and those are like you.

632
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:27,640
Speaker 0: like if you called me I would see your face in the thingy because I added you is the one of the 10 speed dial people.

633
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,305
Speaker 0: alright See what other things are on here.

634
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:34,536
Speaker 0: There's an Evernote integration, which I haven't used because I don't know.

635
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:42,188
Speaker 0: cuz I don't use Evernote There's a New York Times thing which supposedly will tell you like when you know, there's a news alert It'll be like, oh my god crazy news just happens.

636
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,012
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what I have.

637
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:43,756
Speaker 1: that is called Twitter.

638
00:40:43,957 --> 00:40:47,008
Speaker 0: Yeah Path I don't know what app that is.

639
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:47,731
Speaker 0: I haven't used it.

640
00:40:47,852 --> 00:40:50,862
Speaker 0: CNN similar to New York Times Facebook.

641
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:54,180
Speaker 0: I have that enabled but all it really does is let you post to Facebook.

642
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,160
Speaker 0: It doesn't actually give you anything from now.

643
00:40:56,521 --> 00:41:08,498
Speaker 1: This is where really we have to write some apps because what I what with what this hardware actually is and what it does I want an app that will show me slides and speaking notes and help me control a speech.

644
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:09,682
Speaker 0: I'm giving yeah You can do that.

645
00:41:09,823 --> 00:41:11,832
Speaker 0: Yes with a Google Apps integration.

646
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:13,600
Speaker 0: Definitely is capable of doing that.

647
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is a hundred percent a thing.

648
00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:16,013
Speaker 0: This can do.

649
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:16,939
Speaker 1: that is thing.

650
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,943
Speaker 1: one I wanted to do that - I wanted to do is GPS directions.

651
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:25,100
Speaker 0: while I'm biking thing what I want to do is show me the date in addition to the time.

652
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,366
Speaker 1: I mean screen.

653
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:27,492
Speaker 0: It just shows you the time.

654
00:41:27,512 --> 00:41:28,296
Speaker 0: It doesn't show you the date.

655
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:29,040
Speaker 0: It's like what the fuck?

656
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,602
Speaker 0: I want to know what.

657
00:41:29,622 --> 00:41:34,379
Speaker 1: today's when the batteries get better or if I do rig up something cool with an energy battery to keep It going all the time.

658
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:43,932
Speaker 1: I would like to make an app because there's a ton of dashcam apps now for Android that do a really good job of Constantly recording like 10 minutes of video and cycling it.

659
00:41:44,193 --> 00:41:46,420
Speaker 1: but then you can hit a button and it's like oh fuck and it records.

660
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:47,286
Speaker 1: It keeps everything.

661
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:49,119
Speaker 1: It's the someone attacked me.

662
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:50,679
Speaker 1: I want all the police data app.

663
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:55,288
Speaker 1: I feel like you can make a really good app for glass But the battery would be the battery will tell you.

664
00:41:55,308 --> 00:42:03,193
Speaker 0: people seem to think that like this glass it can like camera all the time Like you're videoing your life like the same way if you were wearing like a Buy a GoPro.

665
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:04,704
Speaker 0: It's like yeah No, the camera will.

666
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:08,500
Speaker 0: the battery will die in like 20 minutes if you keep the video running, right?

667
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,491
Speaker 0: It is useless if you think you're gonna video your life with this thing.

668
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:14,000
Speaker 0: Don't even begin to think that's a remote possibility.

669
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:17,620
Speaker 0: There is forget it videoing for long periods of time.

670
00:42:18,022 --> 00:42:21,500
Speaker 0: No cannot do now what you can make lines with it with an app.

671
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:27,380
Speaker 1: You could do something clever where you have it wake up and automatically take a picture every five minutes.

672
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:31,049
Speaker 0: Even that would basically have the battery life.

673
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:31,711
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

674
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:34,480
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but if I'm gonna I'm gonna rig up my energy thing.

675
00:42:34,741 --> 00:42:39,440
Speaker 1: In fact, I'll rig up an energy thing and maybe I'll get someone else to kickstart a battery pack.

676
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,788
Speaker 0: The only reason the Google Glass battery lasts as long as it does is because it always Errors on the side of turning off right.

677
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:48,800
Speaker 0: their philosophy at Google is, you know, don't turn it on.

678
00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:51,080
Speaker 0: It should be sort of like an enhancement.

679
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,524
Speaker 0: It should never bother you right?

680
00:42:52,905 --> 00:43:03,040
Speaker 0: even if you have the Gmail enabled which I don't because it's again not using Google Google apps It will actually only tell you if you've got mail if Gmail considers it an important email.

681
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,500
Speaker 0: So you have to really pay attention to that and you know that feature in Gmail with the important and not important emails.

682
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:11,476
Speaker 0: You really have to train your Gmail saying this message is important.

683
00:43:11,496 --> 00:43:12,058
Speaker 0: This one's not.

684
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:12,600
Speaker 0: this one's important.

685
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,169
Speaker 0: this one's not so that it gets it right and will.

686
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:18,967
Speaker 0: only Google Glass will only wake up and tell you if it was an Important email.

687
00:43:19,008 --> 00:43:26,480
Speaker 0: it'll show you what it was and When it shows you something it turns off right away Like when I turn it on to see the clock it turns off and like a couple seconds.

688
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:28,267
Speaker 0: This thing just really loves to.

689
00:43:28,307 --> 00:43:34,030
Speaker 0: it doesn't turn off fully obviously, but it loves to go to sleep Like imagine if you turn right just like me then.

690
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just like it's like on off off off.

691
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:39,110
Speaker 0: It just doesn't want to stay on.

692
00:43:39,331 --> 00:43:40,960
Speaker 1: well remember what have we been saying?

693
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:49,007
Speaker 1: For since 2005 when we started doing gig nights publicly the biggest thing holding back all the cool things We want to do is technology.

694
00:43:49,048 --> 00:43:51,000
Speaker 1: battery is consumer battery technology?

695
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:56,734
Speaker 1: yep, and That stuff really has not progressed much in recent times because it can't.

696
00:43:56,874 --> 00:44:02,173
Speaker 0: if it progresses then we make tiny grenades And it would also be really heavy on the side of your head right.

697
00:44:02,213 --> 00:44:03,860
Speaker 0: the Google Glass is actually quite comfortable.

698
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,340
Speaker 0: I'm definitely used to it by now.

699
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,480
Speaker 1: We need local wireless power distribution coupled with you like in the smaller your back.

700
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:15,369
Speaker 1: You just carry a fucking battery Whatever it's gonna be.

701
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:19,300
Speaker 0: yeah, you go for it All right, I feel like we can.

702
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:21,740
Speaker 0: I'm trying to think of like other things.

703
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:26,800
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about it probably off and on and our Monday shows for a while now because Scott's gonna keep using it.

704
00:44:27,241 --> 00:44:28,525
Speaker 1: I've been playing with the API's.

705
00:44:28,605 --> 00:44:30,572
Speaker 1: I'm actually once I have glass.

706
00:44:30,812 --> 00:44:33,019
Speaker 1: I'm gonna write some fucking apps faster than you can blink.

707
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:45,540
Speaker 1: Really good examples, it's really easy to write stuff mmm Let's see and I'm not gonna write anything that requires a lot of complex software design.

708
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,100
Speaker 1: I'm writing things that are like show me the slides.

709
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:50,743
Speaker 0: Yeah Turn to these.

710
00:44:50,803 --> 00:44:54,916
Speaker 0: anything else I can say about it is it worth the monies?

711
00:44:55,177 --> 00:45:00,518
Speaker 1: well, maybe You know what it's where it'll be worth the money for me.

712
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:15,354
Speaker 1: Maybe Scott if you write an app or two, and it doesn't cost $300 a month from now If it costs like $800 a month from now or There's something that makes the Explorer Edition different like I what I could see.

713
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:23,277
Speaker 1: I'm guessing here totally shooting from the hip That they'll have consumer glass and Explorer glass with different update patterns or different things.

714
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:25,064
Speaker 0: who knows it's possible Whatever it.

715
00:45:25,245 --> 00:45:27,116
Speaker 0: just it would be nice if they did something.

716
00:45:27,136 --> 00:45:27,840
Speaker 0: you know.

717
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,048
Speaker 0: I mean there are some other benefits of the Explorer.

718
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:37,572
Speaker 0: like I got an email that was like private party at the Explorer place in New York City the place you picked up your Google Glass on The same day as packs.

719
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:42,240
Speaker 0: great guys Thanks come on over and hang out with the other glass explorers.

720
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,034
Speaker 1: Can't figure out the high correlation rate between people who care about glass and people who care about packs.

721
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:54,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, New York Yeah, all right, I kind of want to go hang out with the studio audience for a bit.

724
00:46:05,342 --> 00:46:07,308
Speaker 1: I gotta master this goddamn thing tonight now.

725
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:10,880
