1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,386
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, June 12th.

2
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:12,349
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,500
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:19,980
Speaker 0: Dodgeball Hit somebody.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:39,296
Speaker 0: so a lot of people have been wondering what exactly is going to happen with the geek nights book club now that we've switched to the Temporary sabbatical schedule.

7
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:40,722
Speaker 0: Yeah shows a week in our.

8
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:47,627
Speaker 1: in our eagerness to change up the show We made one change followed by another change that disrupts the first change.

9
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:54,887
Speaker 0: now We're still debating exactly what to do because we've realized a couple of other Minor flaws in our clever plan.

10
00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:00,890
Speaker 0: for one I don't want to make anyone feel bad, and I know people have lives and are busy and that sort of thing.

11
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,310
Speaker 0: But man do you people read slow?

12
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:15,410
Speaker 1: I mean I have a big long commute and I work and I do this show even though I'm doing the show less and I can read faster than all these kids who are like in school with hours and hours of free time.

13
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:20,008
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I think the problem was I remember thinking like alright a month.

14
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:24,170
Speaker 0: well They'll definitely read the first book and I'll bet they can pretty much read the trilogy.

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,880
Speaker 1: So let's just do the whole trilogy and I read it in a couple weeks.

16
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:27,683
Speaker 0: God.

17
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:29,570
Speaker 0: I read the third book in like three days.

18
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:30,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

19
00:01:30,494 --> 00:01:31,398
Speaker 0: That's cuz I went crazy.

20
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,025
Speaker 1: I met the whole trilogy in a couple weeks.

21
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:41,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah But no from from all the feedback We've gotten most of you have barely even gotten through the first book if you're even anywhere near finishing it.

22
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,470
Speaker 1: I mean on the one hand it's okay because you can not listen to the episode and then when you're ready listen to it.

23
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,899
Speaker 0: That would have been fine with the old schedule because whatever.

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,669
Speaker 0: but now Thursdays only come twice a month.

25
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:57,506
Speaker 1: Yes, you'll be missing like a whole month of Thursdays if you aren't ready yet.

26
00:01:57,947 --> 00:02:06,309
Speaker 0: plus at the same time I realized that what as much as I want to talk about the whole trilogy I have more to say about the first book than will fit in one show as it is.

27
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:15,405
Speaker 1: Yeah and at least the books something that usually like when I read something or watch something that's a bunch of Episodes or sequels or something the whole thing blurs into one.

28
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:19,318
Speaker 1: but with these books There's a very clear separation of the three.

29
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,983
Speaker 1: that really it makes it easier.

30
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:21,726
Speaker 1: We'll talk about.

31
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:27,590
Speaker 0: just thing is I forget Exactly where each book ends and I remember exactly where the first book ends.

32
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:28,174
Speaker 0: Well, I don't.

33
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:37,120
Speaker 0: I guess I read it longer ago than you But like I don't remember like okay, I think back it's like alright When exactly did this specific event happen?

34
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:41,416
Speaker 0: and I know it's in like either, you know late first book early second book But I forget exactly.

35
00:02:41,437 --> 00:02:59,690
Speaker 0: the thing is there are certain Demarcation points of knowledge whereby you can talk about a topic from the books But depending on how far other people have read in terms of which book they're on You certain there's a point in which you just can't talk about a topic anymore or a topic means something completely different.

36
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:02,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, like what are the non men?

37
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,926
Speaker 0: we can talk about what are the non men but we can only.

38
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:07,788
Speaker 0: but the context of that Is completely different by the third book?

39
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of difficult because even if we only talk about one book there might be spoilers for the second and thirds.

40
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:28,800
Speaker 0: It's very avoidable as long we just have to limit the number of people on the roundtable and Where I I can at least talk about the first book Can also talk about the first book without spoiling.

41
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,427
Speaker 0: their heads will probably just not include the rest of the crew in the discussion of the first book.

42
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:35,535
Speaker 0: There's no way to because they'll spoil.

43
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:36,097
Speaker 1: Yeah.

44
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,083
Speaker 0: Oh, well regardless.

45
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:40,310
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know exactly what we're gonna do.

46
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,648
Speaker 0: We're probably going to continue and do the review roundtable.

47
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:53,585
Speaker 0: final thoughts Whatever of the first book of the Prince of Nothing trilogy the darkness that comes before Next Thursday's episode which is Thursday after next Thursday.

48
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:54,690
Speaker 1: You got two weeks.

49
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:57,410
Speaker 1: So the next Thursday episode we're gonna talk about this book.

50
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,528
Speaker 1: So at least finish the first book if you're interested, I mean if you're not interested, you don't have to.

51
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:10,916
Speaker 0: yeah I don't know if we'll start the next book yet because I kind of want everyone to read all three of these books then talk About them as a whole.

52
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean we could do that sort of later.

53
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,490
Speaker 1: I kind of want to like if we're actually gonna have a book club.

54
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,079
Speaker 1: we should sort of he always have.

55
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:23,075
Speaker 1: there should always be at any point in time a Book that is the current book.

56
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:31,930
Speaker 0: but at the same time if we introduce a new book when half our listeners haven't even been Able to force their way through the first book then no one's ever gonna finish any of our books.

57
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,662
Speaker 0: They'll just ruin every like second or third Thursday.

58
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,611
Speaker 1: I know it's a tough choice I don't.

59
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:41,228
Speaker 1: I think we'll have to do it like every fourth Thursday, you know, we might just do it organically.

60
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:41,690
Speaker 0: I don't know.

61
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,036
Speaker 0: Read good God.

62
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:46,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we'll just have to say maybe what you know.

63
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:52,870
Speaker 1: If we just you know I mean Oprah doesn't slow down right and she does her book club thing and it sort of just forces people to read faster.

64
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,570
Speaker 0: Which how often does she do it though?

65
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,876
Speaker 1: I think it's every month isn't it?

66
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:57,806
Speaker 0: and how many episodes of Oprah are there?

67
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:58,490
Speaker 1: five a week?

68
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,023
Speaker 0: And also I'll bet a lot of people don't read the Oprah books.

69
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:02,230
Speaker 0: They just watch the next Oprah.

70
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:04,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have no idea what you know.

71
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,250
Speaker 1: But then again, maybe there's a lot of people out there aren't gonna read the book and they're just gonna listen to it.

72
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,029
Speaker 1: Take sort of you know, cuz they like listening to us talk about it.

73
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:15,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time well at least if we talk about just the first book, that's okay.

74
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:18,550
Speaker 0: But if we talk about the trilogy well pretty much ruin.

75
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,162
Speaker 1: I definitely think that you know for the whole book club thing.

76
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:24,510
Speaker 1: We have to keep everything to a single volume.

77
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,230
Speaker 1: You know, I mean if we want to do a whole series what we should do is we should do the first volume.

78
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,829
Speaker 1: Well, and then the problem is your volume should be sort of a special thing.

79
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:34,190
Speaker 1: later.

80
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:37,879
Speaker 0: I think the real problem is that a The majority of you seem to have.

81
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,717
Speaker 0: now you've been able to get through the first volume of this And maybe we should pick an easier book.

82
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,890
Speaker 0: All right next time one fish two fish.

83
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,835
Speaker 1: How's gonna do c-spot run?

84
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:47,779
Speaker 1: We gotta sit.

85
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:47,859
Speaker 1: mr.

86
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,248
Speaker 0: Happy might have to watch out though cuz there's spoilers.

87
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:53,710
Speaker 0: I mean I'm as much as I want to talk about the red fish.

88
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:57,009
Speaker 0: I think we have to wait cuz I don't know if you guys are gonna finish it in time.

89
00:05:57,731 --> 00:06:00,300
Speaker 0: Okay Okay, enough insulting.

90
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,047
Speaker 0: What do we got in the news?

91
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,190
Speaker 1: Okay, so check this out.

92
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,291
Speaker 1: I'm.

93
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:11,890
Speaker 1: actually it was hard to find a news today But then I sort of I'll take the news from like the front page of the newspaper.

94
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:19,369
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, so Supreme Court takes one step for further toward getting rid of this police state terrorism torture BS.

95
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:22,462
Speaker 0: Barack is gonna be the next president of the US.

96
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,150
Speaker 1: All right, so that's that's just fine.

97
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,084
Speaker 1: But what do I have to say about it other than yay for?

98
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,561
Speaker 0: Cub Scouts or Boy Scouts died in a tornado.

99
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:31,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz they were in a tornado.

100
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:32,153
Speaker 0: There was.

101
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:39,409
Speaker 1: there was something on FARC now, but the CEO those are all well and good news But I don't really have much commentary to add to any of them.

102
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:51,336
Speaker 1: You know, there is one news where I do have a lot of commentary to add and that is the news about the basketball now Of the sports that there are professionally Entertaining in the United States.

103
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:52,801
Speaker 1: that was that came off really poorly.

104
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:57,822
Speaker 1: of the major professional sports the United States Basketball is perhaps my least favorite now.

105
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:03,155
Speaker 0: I would rather watch curling Now that is to be.

106
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:05,468
Speaker 1: I say they're about equal curling.

107
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,461
Speaker 1: Basketball is fun to play.

108
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:08,869
Speaker 0: at least curling isn't rigged.

109
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:11,856
Speaker 1: Curling is fun.

110
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:14,230
Speaker 1: curling is less fun to play the basket.

111
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,336
Speaker 0: Curling is pretty fun.

112
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:19,406
Speaker 1: Anyway, well, I guess it could be fun.

113
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:21,858
Speaker 0: for the novelty of it It's a matter of opinion.

114
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,170
Speaker 0: We can't I can't say basketball is objectively bad.

115
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:31,082
Speaker 0: I just I find I find it incredibly uninteresting except I don't know the last 40 seconds of a game and only if it's closed.

116
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:32,689
Speaker 1: Well, basically here's the news, right?

117
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:40,228
Speaker 1: So in basketball when you're playing the game of basketball You're not really allowed to touch people hit people bump into people at.

118
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:43,082
Speaker 1: you know Grab people or else it's a foul.

119
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:46,399
Speaker 1: and there is a you know A rule of what is a foul and what isn't.

120
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,697
Speaker 1: and depending on how you commit the foul, you know There's a penalty that is exact it.

121
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:56,210
Speaker 1: usually the other team gets a number of free throws You know to score points or whatnot, right?

122
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:07,970
Speaker 1: And the thing is if you get a lot of fouls against your team that could basically makes you know No matter how well you play you're gonna lose because they got you know, like a zillion free points, basically.

123
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:20,512
Speaker 1: so The calling of fouls by referees in the NBA the you know Which is the professional basketball league of men in the United States is sort of Inconsistent.

124
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:22,178
Speaker 1: I mean hockey had ice.

125
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:27,573
Speaker 1: hockey is very similar with the calling of penalties, you know tripping Slashing etc.

126
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:40,429
Speaker 1: But for some reason while there's many bullshit penalty calls and also many penalties that go on called It doesn't feel rigged so much even though it can actually turn the tide of a game a lot more than it can in basketball.

127
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:48,557
Speaker 0: Well, and at least it's a sport like hockey while there's a lot of arbitrariness There's kind of this Accepted sense of justice.

128
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:56,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, like and you see this if you graph it out It's pretty clear that if the refs make a bad call one, they know they made a bad call immediately.

129
00:08:56,811 --> 00:09:08,950
Speaker 0: Yep, and what they do in hockey at least is if there's a bad call against one team You can guarantee there will be an equally bad call against the other team at a similarly critical moment before the game is out.

130
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's how they kind of regulate that.

131
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,989
Speaker 1: There's also you know the fans of hockey.

132
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:25,071
Speaker 1: You know while in an individual game you might call bullshit on this that or the other thing like you will at baseball saying Oh, no, he was safe There's a perception of objectivity in the penalty calling in Basketball.

133
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:28,942
Speaker 1: there is no perception of objectivity in the calling of fouls.

134
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:33,135
Speaker 1: It's pretty much completely subjective and It's real.

135
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:35,110
Speaker 1: I mean you're playing this game of basketball.

136
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:37,868
Speaker 1: It's pretty much impossible not to foul beat.

137
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:42,003
Speaker 1: mean I think they should just play basketball and I think they should just make it.

138
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:46,199
Speaker 1: you can't touch anyone period and just if you touch Anyone that's it foul even if you graze them.

139
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,927
Speaker 1: it would make it really, you know, they would.

140
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:49,215
Speaker 1: you know It's sort of.

141
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,410
Speaker 1: it's really the way the game is now.

142
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:54,510
Speaker 1: It's sort of broken and there's not much more I can say about that.

143
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:59,530
Speaker 1: But anyway the news the news is this guy Tim Donahue and he used to be a referee in the NBA.

144
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,415
Speaker 1: Then he turned out to be a felon.

145
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:02,599
Speaker 1: So he's going to jail.

146
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:06,414
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, he turned like it's kind of like he turned out To be a felon.

147
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:08,686
Speaker 0: All right, so he's a normal guy a normal guy and there's like wait a minute.

148
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:09,410
Speaker 0: You're a felon.

149
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:10,113
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

150
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:23,978
Speaker 1: I forgot exactly what he did, but it was a big scandal and he got in big trouble and According to him right now that he's you know already feloned if that's a verb Felonized yes in validated.

151
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,590
Speaker 1: There was a very important playoff games.

152
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:37,530
Speaker 1: There was rigging of the games as in the referees were calling fouls You know aggressively against one team in order to get the results to turn out a certain way.

153
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:39,436
Speaker 1: That would benefit the NBA.

154
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:50,870
Speaker 1: because think about this right if you're the NBA the league you're a for-profit league You know, you're interested in fair competition, I guess, you know theoretically, but primarily you're interested in making money.

155
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:57,210
Speaker 1: So wouldn't it be in your interest as the league to have the incredibly popular team?

156
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:13,246
Speaker 1: against the incredibly popular team in the finals or And as opposed to the team for the middle of nowhere versus the team from the middle of nowhere Like the NHL was much happier with Detroit Pittsburgh, then they would be with Florida Nashville And the Stanley Cup Finals.

157
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:24,201
Speaker 0: luckily We don't have to worry about that so much because subtle rules changes and subtle strategy changes have made it to the point that Offensive old-school teams have a clear advantage in hockey once again.

158
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:34,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, I should but the point is is that Basketball even if it is not rigged they give off this perception that it is indeed rigged.

159
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:46,062
Speaker 1: I mean there was a final and the NBA Finals are going on right now and it's the Lakers versus the Celtics Which is pretty much you couldn't ask for a better Combination of money-making for the NBA in terms of what teams are the finals.

160
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:50,302
Speaker 0: my whole life and to this day whenever someone says Celtics It bothers me a lot.

161
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:51,430
Speaker 1: That's what they are.

162
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:57,167
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm it's like alright, they just pretend it's someone with a Boston accent top pocket in the car.

163
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:58,270
Speaker 1: So the Celtics.

164
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:00,797
Speaker 0: So you pronounce your K's as C's.

165
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,366
Speaker 1: if your boss sees yeah, well, no, that's an X The Red Sox ease.

166
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:07,570
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway.

167
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:13,703
Speaker 1: so Basically, it's a huge deal now because everyone's like, ah, it's rigged.

168
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:14,104
Speaker 1: It's rigged.

169
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:15,710
Speaker 1: The guy says it's rigged and it's tough.

170
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,130
Speaker 1: Do you trust the guy who is the felon and got kicked out?

171
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:25,330
Speaker 1: It actually has a reason to sort of be vengeful and slander, you know his former employer?

172
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:30,548
Speaker 1: or Do you believe him because he's got the balls to?

173
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:30,850
Speaker 1: you know?

174
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:37,830
Speaker 1: Let out the truth that all the people who are still in the organization and it's really impossible to go either way without some more.

175
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:44,400
Speaker 1: But really all I say there needs to be some sort of independent investigation of some sort to figure out what the deal is.

176
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:57,922
Speaker 0: well because if it's rigged presents the fundamental problem in every possible whistleblowing event in the world where Anytime someone is a whistleblower a legitimate whistleblower.

177
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,270
Speaker 0: What what's like especially in the movies?

178
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,569
Speaker 0: You see this all the time, but also in the real world.

179
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:05,158
Speaker 0: What's the obvious thing you do to the whistleblower?

180
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:08,790
Speaker 0: you discredit them in some way in order to prevent people from believing them.

181
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:15,869
Speaker 0: We saw that in that this guy discredited himself, which is yeah, but we saw that in that liberal porn movie man of the year.

182
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:18,280
Speaker 0: It's like not the whistleblower.

183
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,190
Speaker 0: Let's fill her full of heroin.

184
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:23,424
Speaker 0: Yep, and that happens in the real world too.

185
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:29,423
Speaker 0: Anytime someone's a whistleblower Everyone tries to immediately discredit and you think oh, well, obviously they're just trying to discredit.

186
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:39,670
Speaker 0: but at the same time who has More to gain by discrediting than someone who is already in trouble with the organization and is only trying to get revenge.

187
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:40,974
Speaker 0: It's like it's.

188
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:42,540
Speaker 0: it's the least probable thing.

189
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,647
Speaker 0: That is also the most probable thing.

190
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:49,641
Speaker 1: So who you trust It's and that's why it's impossible to know without an independent investigation.

191
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:55,510
Speaker 1: and really for something like the NBA I mean normally I'd be like, you know, what do we care about?

192
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,549
Speaker 1: You know some sport who cares if it's rigged and I mean pro wrestling is you know, not a real sport.

193
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,880
Speaker 1: It's totally fake and no one cares.

194
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:04,070
Speaker 0: I'll say this I don't care if baseball is rigged.

195
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:04,330
Speaker 0: well

196
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,032
Speaker 1: The reason

197
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:06,396
Speaker 0: or basketball reason

198
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:24,050
Speaker 1: that it's important for the government's to check and see if these things is the US government to check and make sure that the major professional sports are rigged or not is because The stadiums for these sports are huge parts of the local economies and it's not government money that pays for these

199
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:25,575
Speaker 0: Disagree all.

200
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:33,944
Speaker 0: the only vested interest our government has is not whether or not the sport is fair But whether or not fans think it's fair and continue to attend.

201
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine, too.

202
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,850
Speaker 0: But you know the point is their prerogative is not necessarily to prevent cheating.

203
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,928
Speaker 0: It is just to make sure that no one thinks they're cheating.

204
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,600
Speaker 0: to that I mean you can argue if you're gonna make the money.

205
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,670
Speaker 1: solution either way is an independent investigation Investigation.

206
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:51,810
Speaker 0: Well, yes because here's the problem.

207
00:14:52,171 --> 00:15:03,621
Speaker 0: What if it appears to be rigged and it turns out that no, that's just the way it rolls Then you have to sack everybody anyway and say yeah, it was rigged now We fixed it and then rig it to make it look like it's not rigged.

208
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:11,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a really tricky situation But regardless it's hard to enjoy a sport when you have the perception that it's just both rigged.

209
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:18,649
Speaker 0: It's hard to enjoy a sport where both teams score Every 20 seconds for the entire game.

210
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:21,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you basically have people trying to get.

211
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:33,264
Speaker 1: I mean seriously, you know in basketball you could just you have five guys Five guys can hold hands and make a wall around, you know around the nets You can't get close to it without touching them and you're not allowed to touch anybody.

212
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,579
Speaker 1: Well, it's not quite that I know because they can just shoot over your head or whatever.

213
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:46,030
Speaker 1: but even then touching is not quite that cut and dry I know but it's a very very Difficult thing to judge and I think basketball in general needs some fixing.

214
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:49,370
Speaker 1: I think really the way to make basketball better is to raise the net.

215
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:53,150
Speaker 0: Just put him another 10 feet up because they got these tall guys.

216
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,190
Speaker 1: But the net isn't really any higher that much higher than it used to be.

217
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,937
Speaker 1: They should make it like 20 feet in the air.

218
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,289
Speaker 1: It's like no one can possibly reach it and you have to shoot.

219
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:02,977
Speaker 0: So, you know what I would do.

220
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:05,167
Speaker 0: I would make three pointers worth four points.

221
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:06,513
Speaker 1: that well I would make.

222
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,386
Speaker 1: actually I would say if you shoot from half-court, it's worth five points.

223
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:20,595
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, you get you get a percentage of points up to that would because then you'd actually the thing is right look at something like like Soccer or even better.

224
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:24,390
Speaker 0: Why don't I just have two nets the 10-foot net and the next to it the 20-foot net?

225
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,269
Speaker 0: That's worth twice as many.

226
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,216
Speaker 1: Then it gets kind of gimmicky.

227
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:30,712
Speaker 1: But yeah, the thing is you look at all these gimmicky sports Awesome.

228
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:31,315
Speaker 1: I know it's.

229
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:34,750
Speaker 1: it's really weird because you look at a gimmicky sport like watching slam ball.

230
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:36,017
Speaker 1: I know remember slam ball.

231
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,230
Speaker 1: It was so gimmicky with trampolines, right?

232
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:41,520
Speaker 1: The thing is the best sport the best team sport ever.

233
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:45,714
Speaker 1: ice hockey is the most gimmicky sport ever But it doesn't look gimmicky.

234
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,942
Speaker 1: But think of how gimmicky that is ice.

235
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:50,330
Speaker 1: It doesn't get gimmick here than ice.

236
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,560
Speaker 0: Why don't we just make basketball happen on ice?

237
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,824
Speaker 1: I'll play that shit.

238
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:55,867
Speaker 0: No, you wouldn't.

239
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:56,730
Speaker 0: you're afraid of skating.

240
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,141
Speaker 1: I'm not afraid of skating.

241
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,210
Speaker 1: I just have to learn skating.

242
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,556
Speaker 0: You want to learn skating.

243
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,970
Speaker 1: every time I've ever skated roller ice or otherwise, right?

244
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:15,349
Speaker 1: I do it and I get and I'll kind of wobble I wobble I wobble and after about an hour I'm kind of just whooshing around not super whooshing around but I can go in a circle without holding the railing and I can stop.

245
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:16,598
Speaker 1: It takes about an hour.

246
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,490
Speaker 0: It's hard to say because I've only ever seen you once.

247
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:25,680
Speaker 0: I remember you held on to the edge of the ice rink and you walked around it a one full Rotation around the entire thing and then you were done.

248
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,730
Speaker 1: No, it's not remember that.

249
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:30,186
Speaker 0: I was the one time we went with like half the crew we went.

250
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:30,690
Speaker 0: it was RIT.

251
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,439
Speaker 0: It was like free but free meant.

252
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:36,690
Speaker 0: Oh, there's no ice skates because everyone on campus is trying to ice skate.

253
00:17:36,992 --> 00:18:00,432
Speaker 1: Anyway, no when I when I ice skate a roller skate Generally What happens is I have to learn again from the beginning because I forgot everything because I don't do it often enough to develop the muscle memory and then I kind of go around like holding on for a while and then eventually like after maybe an hour or so I can skate in a circle and Then stop and that's all I can do is skate forward and stop without holding on to anything and that's as far as I've ever Gotten.

254
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:03,905
Speaker 0: Why don't we imagine if I one-on-one hockey in the street?

255
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:08,964
Speaker 0: I imagine if I And I just want someone to play one-on-one hockey with all right.

256
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,510
Speaker 1: Well, then we need some goalie action.

257
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:17,410
Speaker 0: No, no, you don't one-on-one hockey Is a. maybe it's just cuz where I grew up and it was a common sport of kids two kids.

258
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:20,640
Speaker 0: We'll just play hockey against each other with sticks nets and a ball.

259
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:23,650
Speaker 0: Uh-huh two on two is a lot better but one-on-one works.

260
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, well regardless.

261
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:27,261
Speaker 1: I'm sure if I skated every day.

262
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:29,769
Speaker 1: I eventually would be able to skate averagely.

263
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:32,690
Speaker 0: So this is a little out of the way.

264
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:41,501
Speaker 0: No None of you are gonna have seen this on Fark or slash dot or dig even though I don't think anyone Actually goes to dig anymore for news because dig is.

265
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:49,910
Speaker 0: you know, I've said dig is dead but I haven't been to dig in like two weeks and I went today and It was like there was nothing worthwhile.

266
00:18:50,412 --> 00:19:03,550
Speaker 0: I only go to dig like once every couple weeks if there's not enough videos to watch another site On day that I had not already seen somewhere else better and more reliable with a higher or better signal-to-noise ratio.

267
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,222
Speaker 0: I just dig is done.

268
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:06,390
Speaker 1: It is definitely done.

269
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,680
Speaker 1: I said just cut it out of my RSS feed.

270
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:14,390
Speaker 1: then I cut out and I stopped doing RSS and then I stopped checking dig and I don't miss it at all.

271
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:20,550
Speaker 0: I used to have that policy of in my account on dig to make it bearable anyone who posted anything stupid.

272
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:25,990
Speaker 0: I just immediately put on the ignore list and never look back and I'd added like 600 people to my ignore list.

273
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:31,616
Speaker 0: so I logged in to dig actually today, right and I decided all right.

274
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:36,816
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna look at comments and Ignore everyone to post something stupid.

275
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:47,470
Speaker 0: and as I began to click ignore on every single post I saw and I'm not kidding every single post I saw on the entire front page of two stories.

276
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:49,797
Speaker 0: Awesome, I'm done with dig.

277
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:50,258
Speaker 0: Yeah.

278
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:55,990
Speaker 0: So, uh, here's some news you will find and you might wonder why I'm bringing it up Partly because I'm a rollercoaster.

279
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:59,050
Speaker 0: Well, I was when I was a kid a rollercoaster enthusiast.

280
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,117
Speaker 1: When's the last time you rode a rollercoaster?

281
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:04,829
Speaker 0: the last time I rode something that I would consider a legitimate rollercoaster.

282
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:08,629
Speaker 0: Was the summer after my freshman year at RIT?

283
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,874
Speaker 1: We rode that thing in Wildwood.

284
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,022
Speaker 0: that thing was barely a rollercoaster.

285
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:13,524
Speaker 1: Was it?

286
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,090
Speaker 1: was it a train?

287
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:16,666
Speaker 1: Did it go up and down hills?

288
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:22,686
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah But it was a rollercoaster in the same sense that an Apple - could still be considered a computer.

289
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,190
Speaker 1: It is a computer technically.

290
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,618
Speaker 1: Yes, however, I was so fun.

291
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:29,328
Speaker 1: It's still fun to use an Apple - and play some Oregon Trail.

292
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:31,378
Speaker 0: No, it's not It's really not it is.

293
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,449
Speaker 0: it's much more fun to just play.

294
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:36,460
Speaker 1: It's not more fun to play Oregon trails.

295
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,890
Speaker 1: All right, but it's still fun to play the old Oregon Trail.

296
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:40,636
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

297
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,886
Speaker 1: I would never the price we had to pay good God.

298
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:43,790
Speaker 1: It was like 10 bucks.

299
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,426
Speaker 0: I would never go out of my way to use an Apple - if anything I would use an Apple - emulator.

300
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:49,069
Speaker 1: I would.

301
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:49,831
Speaker 1: yeah All right.

302
00:20:50,393 --> 00:20:50,614
Speaker 1: Yeah.

303
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,300
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's like playing man.

304
00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:01,010
Speaker 1: We could we have a big roller coaster and We use it to emulate smaller roller coasters, but not if but the track modifies itself.

305
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:06,362
Speaker 0: Anyway, I was somewhat of a roller coaster enthusiast.

306
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:15,109
Speaker 0: now part of this was because I grew up in the Midwest and I'm not saying that every roller coaster park in the world or roller coaster in the world is bad because that's absolutely not true.

307
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:27,550
Speaker 0: and but the deal is that there's this place called Cedar Point and a lot of people outside of The Midwest who aren't roller coaster enthusiasts like as a geekery don't really know much about Cedar Point.

308
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:30,526
Speaker 0: But basically it is the never heard of it.

309
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:31,089
Speaker 1: so I met you.

310
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it is the roller coaster capital of the world and has been for as long as there have been.

311
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:40,203
Speaker 1: Thing in Japan no Tokyo spotland that do you know.

312
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:42,330
Speaker 0: how few roller coasters are there, but they're crazy.

313
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:43,616
Speaker 0: They're not that crazy.

314
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,219
Speaker 1: They're that one.

315
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:44,802
Speaker 1: That's great.

316
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:46,590
Speaker 1: They like two or three that are stupid crazy.

317
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:47,901
Speaker 0: Not so much I could.

318
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:48,949
Speaker 0: I could talk about that.

319
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:54,930
Speaker 0: But anyway, Cedar Point is the roller coaster capital of the world and the amusement ride capital of the world.

320
00:21:55,291 --> 00:22:07,770
Speaker 0: They have like they have almost 80 real rides not counting like the kiddie rides and they have 17 Rollercoasters the weakest of which are better than the best roller coaster at the average amusement park.

321
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:09,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Six Flags.

322
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,960
Speaker 1: New England is pretty good But they've got let's see if I can cat last I checked.

323
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,786
Speaker 1: they had like one two three four five.

324
00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:20,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe six or seven roller coasters.

325
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:22,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, Cedar Point has like.

326
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:26,507
Speaker 0: Most of the roller coasters are over 200 feet like all the good one.

327
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:27,886
Speaker 0: Oh my god I don't want even get into it.

328
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:32,045
Speaker 0: But anyway Cedar Point is like the roller coaster place.

329
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,250
Speaker 0: if you like roller coasters.

330
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:35,621
Speaker 0: That is the like the only place in the world.

331
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:36,625
Speaker 0: Like if you haven't been there.

332
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:37,630
Speaker 0: There's no point in going anywhere.

333
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,696
Speaker 1: It's also the amusement park with Snoopy.

334
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:40,478
Speaker 0: Yes.

335
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:41,260
Speaker 0: It used to not be.

336
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,406
Speaker 0: that's a relatively recent change.

337
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:44,670
Speaker 0: It used to be Berenstain Bears.

338
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,870
Speaker 0: Yeah Berenstain bear country was there with all these learning science II exhibits.

339
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:53,176
Speaker 0: It was really cool and they tell you stories.

340
00:22:53,598 --> 00:23:01,666
Speaker 0: and then one year I went and it was gone and in its place was Snoopy Land and Snoopy land was nothing but kiddie rides and food.

341
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:04,397
Speaker 1: Wasn't that better than Berenstain bear country.

342
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:06,410
Speaker 0: No Berenstain bear country was much better.

343
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,458
Speaker 1: Well, if you're a kid, wouldn't you rather ride rides?

344
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:15,029
Speaker 0: then look at that because learning she I would ride the roller coasters Yeah, and then I'd go to Berenstain bear country and learn stuff.

345
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,697
Speaker 1: What what would you want to learn?

346
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:18,500
Speaker 1: and ride roller coasters.

347
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,887
Speaker 1: and he could ride roller coasters and ride roller coasters.

348
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:21,769
Speaker 0: I'm a nerd.

349
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:22,823
Speaker 1: anyway.

350
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:25,716
Speaker 1: Snoopy is way better than Berenstain bears.

351
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:25,997
Speaker 0: Yes.

352
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:26,619
Speaker 0: I agree.

353
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,967
Speaker 1: However, they gotta have Woodstock hockey rink.

354
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:31,570
Speaker 0: Let me put it this way Here's it looks like a giant bird bad.

355
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:37,381
Speaker 0: Here's why I had a problem with Snoopy Because Berenstain bear country and all that stuff is Cedar Point had this.

356
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:47,110
Speaker 0: it had this kind of old-school level of class like it was this kind of classy not Over-commercialized thing and there were no like gift shops or anything there.

357
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,130
Speaker 0: There weren't even that many gift shops in Cedar Point.

358
00:23:49,892 --> 00:24:00,523
Speaker 0: But when they brought Snoopy you the the amount of Snoopy merchandise that was being sold at Every turn like they replaced every science exhibit left in the park with a Snoopy like gift store.

359
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:05,797
Speaker 1: and now you know the The trials of Bill Watterson.

360
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:06,479
Speaker 0: Yes.

361
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,000
Speaker 0: Yes.

362
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,501
Speaker 0: I do.

363
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:08,945
Speaker 0: There's no Kelvin and Hobsland.

364
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:18,910
Speaker 0: Thank the gods, but Cedar Point Despite the I mean this is a place where you'd pay like 65 bucks to get in for one fucking day.

365
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:20,999
Speaker 1: That's about right for an amusement park.

366
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a major amusement park.

367
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:27,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was but for 17 roller coasters They gives it was only like a hundred bucks for a year pass.

368
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:33,568
Speaker 1: So that's the thing They always get you with the year passes where most people come there for a single day.

369
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:37,670
Speaker 1: most, you know I mean and this is Disney World we get like a three-day because you want to see everything.

370
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:39,836
Speaker 1: You know most most amusement parks.

371
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:44,250
Speaker 1: one day is enough to do everything once and very few people come back for a second day.

372
00:24:44,731 --> 00:24:51,775
Speaker 1: So they always give you that they always have the year pass on offer because it's basically if you're gonna stay more than one day You should buy the year pass.

373
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:58,210
Speaker 1: and if you get a year pass and you actually come a lot You're gonna spend a lot of money on those overpriced foods and gifts.

374
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:04,995
Speaker 0: And if you are just staying for two days because when you want to eat you go out of the park to the marina I needed that diner.

375
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:09,937
Speaker 1: Yep, and that's the cheap year pass That's always cheaper than two single-day passes.

376
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:17,029
Speaker 1: really entices people to buy it and thus stay for two days And that's what they make like twice as much money off of you.

377
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:23,330
Speaker 0: Anyway, attendance at San revenue at Cedar Point itself is down this year despite the bag.

378
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,615
Speaker 1: It's down in every news.

379
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:25,900
Speaker 1: No, it's not in parks.

380
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:27,305
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not.

381
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:38,833
Speaker 0: no not at all In fact on average not just the amusement parks owned by the company that deals with Cedar Point See and all that but all Amusement parks.

382
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:43,168
Speaker 0: on average their attendance is pretty much static and on the aggregate.

383
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:44,071
Speaker 0: They're doing fine Really?

384
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:46,241
Speaker 1: I was hearing that amusement parks were down.

385
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:46,924
Speaker 0: They're not.

386
00:25:46,984 --> 00:26:09,170
Speaker 0: what's down is individual parks are down but that's being made up for by other parks and The speculation is that basically people are going like they want to go to an amusement park But they're not willing to travel far or pay a lot of money to go to an amusement park Like they used to in the past because the economy's down and gas prices are up and all that.

387
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:15,110
Speaker 1: Mostly I think there's a lot of cheaper forms of entertainment than the music music part.

388
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're a lot less difficult and have a lot less stress involved.

389
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,516
Speaker 0: What people are doing is they're going to.

390
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:26,330
Speaker 0: they're going to less good closer amusement parks like splashdown Park.

391
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:28,720
Speaker 0: Yes, good God that place is like 40 bucks.

392
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,704
Speaker 0: It has like three.

393
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:31,998
Speaker 1: if it wasn't if it was ten bucks I would have gone there.

394
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:32,705
Speaker 1: but 40 bucks ten bucks.

395
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:38,750
Speaker 0: Everyone within 40 miles would be there and you'd have to wait two hours to ride the 20-foot slide.

396
00:26:39,312 --> 00:26:48,884
Speaker 1: I'm saying I would take a day off of work and you know, well, you know when no one was there and Scott I've driven past that place on work days even like hot days in the summer.

397
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:52,713
Speaker 0: The line is out the park Good God.

398
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:53,235
Speaker 0: All right.

399
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:57,290
Speaker 0: So anyway, but uh, yeah, that's pretty much it my that's my news.

400
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:02,500
Speaker 0: It's kind of excuse to point out that if you're a rollercoaster fan See your point is really the only place to go.

401
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,862
Speaker 0: but you know, I see your points down despite Despite being the rollercoaster capital of the world.

402
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:09,430
Speaker 0: It's in Ohio.

403
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:11,699
Speaker 0: Who's going to go to Ohio?

404
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,289
Speaker 0: except people are already in, Ohio?

405
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,042
Speaker 0: Michigan's Michigan, yeah, but they're right there.

406
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:24,629
Speaker 0: They're right next to it Indiana's and not so much because it's in the corner by the Great Lakes not the corner by Indiana by the other Great Lakes.

407
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:33,266
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

408
00:27:33,286 --> 00:27:39,720
Speaker 0: now someone's gonna say but Ren this was on dig Yeah, it was also elsewhere.

409
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:54,809
Speaker 0: Anyway on YouTube someone put up a long excerpt from one of Carl Sagan's things and it's basically about the library of Alexandria and the history of that and what it meant for the world and What happened to it in case you didn't know.

410
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:56,133
Speaker 1: and now we have Wikipedia.

411
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:57,759
Speaker 1: Let's hope it doesn't also burn down.

412
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:01,706
Speaker 0: I Don't know what I can say.

413
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:03,880
Speaker 0: Carl Sagan is one of my personal heroes.

414
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:07,553
Speaker 0: I have so much respect for that man and the things that he did.

415
00:28:07,573 --> 00:28:15,620
Speaker 0: I in a lot of ways Part of the rationale for doing geek nights and the reason we bring up certain topics so often is that in some small way?

416
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,659
Speaker 0: I want to spread his messages at least a tiny bit to the world.

417
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,699
Speaker 1: Well people's certain messages in general his messages being some of them.

418
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:27,840
Speaker 0: Well, it just so happens that his messages tend to very much coincide with my messages.

419
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:33,919
Speaker 0: Gee, I wonder how that could be partly because I remember reading cosmos as a kid and partly because he's right.

420
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:37,051
Speaker 0: Anyway, I highly recommend.

421
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:45,460
Speaker 0: if you don't know a lot about Carl Sagan Or if you don't know a lot about the library of Alexandria Or if you have never seen Carl Sagan talk about the library of Alexandria.

422
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:51,124
Speaker 0: This video is incredibly depressing And I'll leave it.

423
00:28:51,184 --> 00:28:54,799
Speaker 0: if it doesn't depress you fuck you if it doesn't depress you.

424
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,686
Speaker 1: Anyway All right, so check this out.

425
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:07,914
Speaker 1: I don't know what Forex is But I know it has something to do with trading of stocks and finance.

426
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:09,980
Speaker 0: I I cannot comment but continue.

427
00:29:10,961 --> 00:29:17,760
Speaker 1: The point is is that trading stocks and things if you're not actually risking your monies is pretty fun.

428
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,791
Speaker 1: I mean I played the stock market game was out in seventh grade.

429
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:21,333
Speaker 1: I won.

430
00:29:21,353 --> 00:29:23,160
Speaker 1: I went to the floor of the stock exchange.

431
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,708
Speaker 1: It wasn't that great.

432
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,980
Speaker 1: It's kind of boring down there a lot of paper on the floor.

433
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:29,529
Speaker 1: I think these like throwing paper on the floor for the aesthetic.

434
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:31,335
Speaker 1: Well, it's really not necessary.

435
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,830
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is It depends on what kind of exchange.

436
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,126
Speaker 1: and the guy yeah, but the guys who sweep up the floor They just like to keep their jobs.

437
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:38,990
Speaker 1: It's like a union thing.

438
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,176
Speaker 1: You gotta drop paper on the floor.

439
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,020
Speaker 1: So we keep my jobs.

440
00:29:42,743 --> 00:29:51,880
Speaker 0: But I gotta say cuz at work, you know Sometimes like we want to do a test or something and I can connect to the non-production Servers and I remember being one of my co-workers wanted to test something.

441
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:59,499
Speaker 0: So I bought 1 million shares of IBM And it was really fun anyway.

442
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:12,692
Speaker 1: And then when I was like high school When Yahoo Finance existed they had a stock market game on there and I played that I got crushed because I was versus the world Instead of versus the seventh graders in town.

443
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:14,460
Speaker 0: So well, here's the problem.

444
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:23,080
Speaker 0: If you look at the stock market in aggregate It pretty much looks like and emulates in a lot of ways white noise, yeah.

445
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:26,640
Speaker 1: So there's this program here.

446
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,168
Speaker 1: It's like a forex trading application right.

447
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:35,152
Speaker 1: and if you were actually interested in doing forex trading whatever that is Imagine it stands for finance.

448
00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:36,439
Speaker 1: No something something now.

449
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:44,674
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you're interested in doing that these people have a program that lets you do that And it looks like a pretty good program at least judging from looking at it.

450
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:45,940
Speaker 1: What do I know about this, right?

451
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:58,684
Speaker 1: But if you just want to pretend to do some forex trading You can sign up get a free account and use their application as a game for free Forever.

452
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:06,535
Speaker 1: so you can just pretend to be a forex trader and play it as a game Which I imagine is mad fun and also mad educational.

453
00:31:07,057 --> 00:31:07,680
Speaker 1: and it's free.

454
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,812
Speaker 1: So why the hell not?

455
00:31:09,832 --> 00:31:11,300
Speaker 1: I think it's a pretty damn good thing of the day.

456
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:13,805
Speaker 0: I'll explain a little bit at least.

457
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:17,917
Speaker 0: forex means or stands for foreign exchange.

458
00:31:18,598 --> 00:31:21,835
Speaker 0: Oh, yes It's pretty much just the currency market.

459
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:27,318
Speaker 0: Ah which is some buy ends sell euros is fun to think about.

460
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:42,371
Speaker 0: but Basically, all I can really say about this is that the margins on currency trading are very low and it's not A game you just pretend to have bajillion dollars.

461
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:42,753
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

462
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:44,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't know if they let you.

463
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:46,180
Speaker 1: I think they I don't know if it's actually a game.

464
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,556
Speaker 1: Maybe they start everyone off with the same amount of money or something.

465
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:49,120
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

466
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:50,728
Speaker 1: I don't know how it works either.

467
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:51,572
Speaker 1: I'd actually try it.

468
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:52,296
Speaker 1: It just looks cool.

469
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:53,040
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try it later.

470
00:31:53,482 --> 00:31:54,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

471
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:55,993
Speaker 0: It's that sort of thing is really fun.

472
00:31:56,013 --> 00:32:01,599
Speaker 1: I really can't comment too much Yeah, but it is fun to pretend to buy and sell stocks and things.

473
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:08,667
Speaker 1: I don't actually do this sort of thing unless it's your job because You're basically just risking a whole lot of money on nothing.

474
00:32:09,248 --> 00:32:18,959
Speaker 0: see my guess is that this is basically a Marketing ploy to trick people into thinking that they can make a bunch of money and look how easy it is.

475
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:22,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, I based is just on going to the website and looking.

476
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:23,398
Speaker 1: I mean that's what they did in the 90s.

477
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:30,100
Speaker 1: Well, I was like etrade and Ameritrade and all those other like online day trading programs who would quit their jobs.

478
00:32:30,421 --> 00:32:32,770
Speaker 1: They'd get these online day trading programs.

479
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:34,135
Speaker 1: They'd be like, ah, this is fun.

480
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:38,507
Speaker 1: They like watch little graphs Buttons and hope they could make money that way.

481
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:41,517
Speaker 0: I'm going to point out something that ruined the stock market.

482
00:32:41,557 --> 00:32:43,305
Speaker 0: that is on Wikipedia.

483
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:46,340
Speaker 0: I'm looking at it right now because I like this page.

484
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:57,119
Speaker 0: I find it funny that it's here, but there's a page on Wikipedia entitled Forex underscore scam And I will leave it at that.

485
00:32:58,322 --> 00:33:00,987
Speaker 1: But the game is free So it's not as big that's.

486
00:33:01,027 --> 00:33:01,992
Speaker 1: that part is not a.

487
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:03,580
Speaker 0: I can tell you about a much better game.

488
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,464
Speaker 0: That's also free.

489
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:05,851
Speaker 0: It's called dodgeball.

490
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:06,654
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

491
00:33:06,775 --> 00:33:07,217
Speaker 1: Oh, we're ready.

492
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,181
Speaker 1: We're getting into it Are we?

493
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:13,640
Speaker 0: dodgeball is a game of dodging balls in a non-homosexual way?

494
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:26,383
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is a dodgeball is that there's so many varieties of dodgeball and the exact rules But they all have one thing in common one person or one team throws balls at the other team until they are not Unconscious.

495
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:30,657
Speaker 1: Yes, and if you get hit with a ball, but you fail to also catch the ball.

496
00:33:30,918 --> 00:33:31,640
Speaker 1: That is bad.

497
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:32,666
Speaker 0: What if it's a trap though?

498
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:34,216
Speaker 0: What if you trap it between you and the wall?

499
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:34,880
Speaker 0: Are you in the floor?

500
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,790
Speaker 1: I don't know, but then we're gonna get into that.

501
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:46,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in Nowadays dodgeball is not allowed in many schools where safety Nazi parents have ruined fun for children.

502
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,971
Speaker 0: It's not for safety though, because dodgeball is super.

503
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:49,835
Speaker 0: you can't get hurt.

504
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:51,100
Speaker 0: playing for self-esteem.

505
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,432
Speaker 0: Yes, yes is for self-esteem is the same thing, but I don't understand.

506
00:33:55,472 --> 00:34:02,740
Speaker 0: like I can understand the same overprotective bullshit I'm okay with not making kids throw medicine balls around anymore.

507
00:34:03,763 --> 00:34:07,393
Speaker 0: I fucking hurt myself with a medicine medicine balls.

508
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:10,063
Speaker 1: Okay, but we're talking like foam balls here All right.

509
00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:12,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we play dodgeball with nerf balls.

510
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,847
Speaker 0: Well when the school made we played him with.

511
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:16,920
Speaker 1: they were nerf volleyballs, there are volleyballs, but they're made of foam.

512
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:19,812
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing when we were forced to play in gym class.

513
00:34:19,952 --> 00:34:21,699
Speaker 0: We played with this foam dodgeball crap.

514
00:34:22,263 --> 00:34:23,871
Speaker 0: We played on our own case balls.

515
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:26,963
Speaker 1: No volleyballs Volleyballs are okay, too.

516
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:27,425
Speaker 0: That's cuz.

517
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:28,127
Speaker 0: we were hardcore.

518
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:28,408
Speaker 0: Yes.

519
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:31,578
Speaker 0: Okay real men play with softballs.

520
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:32,219
Speaker 1: No, you know.

521
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,532
Speaker 1: Well, I guess softballs as in softball the game.

522
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:38,620
Speaker 1: No softballs and balls that are soft.

523
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:41,467
Speaker 0: Yes I know this is a cultural thing.

524
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:42,610
Speaker 0: like this happens in Japan.

525
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:47,952
Speaker 0: people play dodgeball in school and Jam and I know in America I don't know how much in the rest of the world.

526
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:49,320
Speaker 0: So I know we have a lot of foreign listeners.

527
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,737
Speaker 0: So basically dodgeball is a game that is played almost entirely by kids.

528
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:02,480
Speaker 0: We're forced to play it in gym class by gym instructors who are lazy Don't want to deal with teaching or anything at all

529
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:07,960
Speaker 1: And it's basically it's a special treat because usually they make the kids do something that is less fun like run laps

530
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:15,732
Speaker 0: Most as far as I've seen most gym classes in this country, especially in crappy schools You'll play dodgeball like every gym class now

531
00:35:15,793 --> 00:35:19,234
Speaker 1: and when I was in school That's all was a special treat in

532
00:35:19,294 --> 00:35:20,000
Speaker 0: good schools.

533
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:28,036
Speaker 0: But I went to a crappy elementary school for one grade in fifth grade and let me tell you We played dodgeball three out of five gym class.

534
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:37,699
Speaker 0: That'd be awesome Except no because basically the teacher would walk out and say dodgeball And he'd make it splits up into two teams and then he'd walk out of the room.

535
00:35:38,145 --> 00:35:38,473
Speaker 1: awesome.

536
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:45,600
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, the teacher definitely needs to be there to be constantly refereeing which is what always happened when I played dodgeball.

537
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:53,371
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I want to hear from people around the world Like how does the dodgeball you play if you played it work?

538
00:35:53,391 --> 00:36:00,120
Speaker 1: because there are different rule sets all over the place with huge Variations and it's not really played outside of schools.

539
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,722
Speaker 1: There's no real.

540
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:06,380
Speaker 0: there's not a lot of professional dodgeballs except at our IT where we had the intramural dodgeball.

541
00:36:06,521 --> 00:36:08,588
Speaker 1: I should have gotten into that but I didn't know.

542
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:14,334
Speaker 0: the only reason I didn't is because they always met or had their games During other things that I was more invested in.

543
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:14,737
Speaker 1: Yeah.

544
00:36:14,857 --> 00:36:19,297
Speaker 0: Yeah So you had no official responsibilities to the RIT anime club.

545
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:22,527
Speaker 0: no, but You were basically the vizier.

546
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:24,113
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was I gonna do that?

547
00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:25,579
Speaker 1: Who was I gonna play dodgeball?

548
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,411
Speaker 0: Yeah There was that one time we challenged the gaming club to dodgeball.

549
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:32,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, and no one from the anime club showed up.

550
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:34,653
Speaker 0: So we just all played dodgeball together for like two hours.

551
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:35,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was an okay time.

552
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:46,437
Speaker 1: so I played two different Varieties of dodgeball when I was in school and I'll share them with you because I really I really like explaining how these work because I We had some really good rule sets going on.

553
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:52,519
Speaker 1: The problem is these games only worked in a gymnasium with lots of with relatively lots of equipment, right?

554
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,012
Speaker 1: So the first kind of dodgeball we played was prisoner dodgeball.

555
00:36:57,032 --> 00:37:01,587
Speaker 1: the way it worked is you had a gymnasium Preferably as big as possible depending how many people.

556
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:12,360
Speaker 1: you had two teams, right and you can go anywhere you want But you can only go between the half-court line and sort of the the backcourt out of bounds.

557
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:18,560
Speaker 0: Well, I think we can skip all those specific because pretty much everyone played in a gym and you couldn't go over the middle line.

558
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:25,160
Speaker 0: Right, they line up like five balls or so I guess line the center like you realize all those lines on the floor?

559
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,542
Speaker 0: He's no.

560
00:37:25,602 --> 00:37:29,980
Speaker 0: like school gyms have like a million different lines and paying about sport you're playing use different lines.

561
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,568
Speaker 0: Yep, they all have names.

562
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:38,218
Speaker 1: I know I don't think our listeners know all the names So we won't use the center line as in if it was basketball the line that goes across the middle.

563
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:45,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Anyway, so basically they go go and then the game starts and you go and you try to grab the balls off the front.

564
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:50,499
Speaker 1: But of course running up to grab the balls first you risk someone getting there before you and then nailing you really easily.

565
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:52,049
Speaker 0: god That's gonna be in that thread.

566
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you just said good god.

567
00:37:54,141 --> 00:38:01,007
Speaker 1: Anyway, so run up and get the balls and then you pretty much just throw the balls back and forth and you try to hit People on the other team.

568
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:03,020
Speaker 1: and but if they catch it you're out.

569
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,065
Speaker 1: but if you hit them and they don't catch it, they're out.

570
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:09,190
Speaker 1: if you're out you raise your hand and You walk across.

571
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:14,004
Speaker 1: You know the other team zone and stand behind the enemy team.

572
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,215
Speaker 1: and when you're standing behind the enemy team You're in prison.

573
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:20,266
Speaker 1: and if you're in prison, you can't get out.

574
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:32,989
Speaker 1: you're basically stuck there But people on your team if they want to can attempt to throw the balls over the enemy team and if you in prison catch it, you're out of prison and you can bring the ball back to your team side.

575
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:35,559
Speaker 1: and That's pretty much it.

576
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,601
Speaker 1: the game doesn't really have an end Situation unless you get the entire other team into prison.

577
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:46,801
Speaker 0: and then here's here's the fundamental Problem with dodgeball as it is played by most people in schools.

578
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:49,550
Speaker 0: It is not designed to be a good game.

579
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:54,170
Speaker 1: It is designed to last a long time and it's designed to be fun throw balls people try to hit.

580
00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:04,550
Speaker 0: It's also designed to be fun for everyone and as opposed because if you play I mean the web I always want to play dodgeball on our own because we'd always like pretty much they'd make us play dodgeball in gym.

581
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,170
Speaker 0: We hated it, but then we go to recess and we'd all play dodgeball.

582
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:11,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, we played it real and we all like we got really into it.

583
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:13,755
Speaker 0: Like we all formed our teams We'd be running around.

584
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:16,670
Speaker 0: we had strategies where like one guy yells candy bar candy bar.

585
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,410
Speaker 0: I forget what candy bar was but that's the only strategy I remember.

586
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:26,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only other thing about prisoner dodgeballs that if you made a basket, you know Cuz they had the basketball nets down.

587
00:39:26,036 --> 00:39:29,390
Speaker 1: you basically had to make a basket from half court with a foam volleyball.

588
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:30,513
Speaker 1: Quite a feat.

589
00:39:31,175 --> 00:39:33,903
Speaker 1: the entire your entire team got out of prison, which is awesome.

590
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:35,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean what happened.

591
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:47,704
Speaker 0: it was like oh, man Shit gimmicky ways of playing and all that stuff and I don't want to get into all the different gimmicks cuz I'm up the mind that the best way to play dodgeball is just if you're out.

592
00:39:47,724 --> 00:39:52,045
Speaker 0: you're out last team, whatever Yeah, and you probably want at least two balls.

593
00:39:52,408 --> 00:39:56,181
Speaker 1: Yeah More balls, I actually think is better because he it's it turns.

594
00:39:56,201 --> 00:40:01,370
Speaker 1: yet less of that action where a guy just stands there with the Ball, he sort of hides it behind his back.

595
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:04,221
Speaker 0: Well, no Here's the problem that I always ran into.

596
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:13,510
Speaker 0: if there was just one ball pretty much I let my entire team get eliminated because I just kind of I would just like ignore everyone and just duck behind people or push Him in front of the ball or something.

597
00:40:14,072 --> 00:40:19,270
Speaker 0: And if I was the last one left, I just stand in the middle and there's only one ball and it's a big ball.

598
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:23,270
Speaker 0: No one can throw it so fast that I can't catch it or die.

599
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:26,203
Speaker 1: I see if you stand far away from the line, and I'm the only one left.

600
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,670
Speaker 0: So basically it's a standoff.

601
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:34,053
Speaker 0: I will stand there and if they throw it at me either catch it and they're out or it bounces doesn't do anything or They miss me.

602
00:40:34,275 --> 00:40:34,556
Speaker 1: You have.

603
00:40:34,576 --> 00:40:38,759
Speaker 1: the situation though is if you dodge it, then you pick it up You have to throw it at them without them catching.

604
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:42,409
Speaker 1: No, I would just roll it back over it back There you go.

605
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:48,710
Speaker 0: No, actually our gym had a good rule and we adapted this to the playground which was great because the playground wasn't even where.

606
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:53,330
Speaker 0: If the ball bounced as long as it was in the air when it hits you accounted.

607
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:59,269
Speaker 0: So if you bounced off the ground and that bounced up and hit someone in the nuts, that was totally okay.

608
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:06,929
Speaker 0: But by the same token if you trapped it against the wall or against the ground It was just a read like it didn't count for anything, huh?

609
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,037
Speaker 1: That's all right.

610
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:09,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, you come with everyone.

611
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:14,650
Speaker 0: So as a result my strategy is usually to kick the ball and just kind of randomly bounce around and being someone in the face.

612
00:41:15,315 --> 00:41:32,110
Speaker 1: See actually there was another variety of dodgeball We played and I remember I played it because I went to like They had like this summer program where you would go to the school Right if you go to one of the schools in the summer for a few weeks and like a little bus came to get you which is why my mom sent me there because then she didn't have to drive me and The.

613
00:41:32,352 --> 00:41:35,550
Speaker 1: basically you chose two activities and did one in the morning and one of the afternoon.

614
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,693
Speaker 1: So I just chose gym and computers Every time.

615
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:39,054
Speaker 1: see.

616
00:41:39,154 --> 00:41:42,949
Speaker 0: the funny thing is as athletic as I am and how much I like all that sort of stuff.

617
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:45,390
Speaker 0: I from from sixth grade.

618
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:54,441
Speaker 0: Until the one gym class I was required to take in order to graduate high school that I probably could have gotten out of If I pitched enough, I never took a gym class.

619
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:56,490
Speaker 1: We had to take gym class every single year.

620
00:41:56,691 --> 00:42:04,430
Speaker 0: We see if you were in the marching band You didn't have to take gym class and in middle school if you're in the band, you didn't have to take gym class.

621
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,275
Speaker 1: No in our school.

622
00:42:05,355 --> 00:42:07,789
Speaker 1: Everyone absolutely had to take physical education all the time.

623
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:11,466
Speaker 0: The worst thing was though you didn't have to shower in gym classes either.

624
00:42:11,526 --> 00:42:12,370
Speaker 0: so no one shower.

625
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,338
Speaker 1: We need to shower but we had to change clothes.

626
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:17,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, I often didn't just because I didn't care.

627
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:22,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the one gym class I took my senior basically your grade in gym was do you show up?

628
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:23,352
Speaker 1: Do you have?

629
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:24,381
Speaker 1: did you change your clothes?

630
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:30,686
Speaker 0: I decided to take Individual sports which was like a week of archery and a week of tennis.

631
00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:31,730
Speaker 1: We had options like that.

632
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:35,718
Speaker 1: You could have taken net games, which is volleyball table tennis You know what?

633
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:36,329
Speaker 0: I totally did.

634
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:46,750
Speaker 0: I played through the ping-pong part Because I was awesome at ping-pong and I played through the archery part because I think archery is really cool and I convinced the teacher For the rest of it that I was gonna go do martial arts upstairs.

635
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:54,085
Speaker 0: I didn't know any martial arts and I'd pretty much just sleep up there or play my gameboy or my name gear Awesome, or do my or go home.

636
00:42:54,388 --> 00:43:00,150
Speaker 1: Yep Anyway, so the other kind of vault dodgeball that I played which actually I like more was a really cool game.

637
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,916
Speaker 1: They had a name for it, but I forget what it was.

638
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:02,498
Speaker 1: I really like.

639
00:43:02,518 --> 00:43:15,024
Speaker 1: remember they actually had three different kinds of balls Right, they had the foam volleyball They had the void kick balls, ah the void kick ball.

640
00:43:15,044 --> 00:43:26,770
Speaker 1: and they had the nerve footballs right and they were sort of different distributions like there was only one or two nerve footballs and the rest were sort of half and Half the voids and the the foam balls, right?

641
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:32,656
Speaker 1: The foam balls were for nailing people and you would get a point if you nailed someone But no one got eliminated.

642
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:35,289
Speaker 1: if you caught one of those you also got a point, right?

643
00:43:36,254 --> 00:43:39,010
Speaker 1: The void balls were actually dual purpose.

644
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:44,370
Speaker 1: You could either peg someone but you got less points for that because it was easier to peg someone with it.

645
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:51,590
Speaker 1: But with those you could try to score a basket and get three points and with the football you could drop kick it between.

646
00:43:51,992 --> 00:43:58,665
Speaker 1: Like these the two things that the basketball net was hanging on, you know The two things that hang it from the ceiling and he scored a field goal.

647
00:43:58,705 --> 00:43:59,710
Speaker 1: It was like five points.

648
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:08,043
Speaker 1: It was crazy and that was really fun because you were getting all these different kinds of balls and like the Drop-kick was such a rare event that anyone even attempted it.

649
00:44:08,304 --> 00:44:09,550
Speaker 1: It was just sort of weird that way.

650
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:14,530
Speaker 1: So I would always try for the drop kick every time because it was like, oh man, someone's trying it.

651
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,835
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh, man.

652
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:31,385
Speaker 0: I just I like the much simpler course the one time we were playing dodgeball we had like four different balls out there and one single yellow nerf arrow from the bow and arrow because basically you could throw that thing and actually was really cool.

653
00:44:31,425 --> 00:44:39,923
Speaker 0: if you held it by the front and Threw it like tail forward like a dagger It would go out and then straighten itself out and just make a b-line.

654
00:44:40,104 --> 00:44:42,133
Speaker 1: Yeah, they throw it pretty high and hard though You did.

655
00:44:42,354 --> 00:44:44,330
Speaker 1: it's a lot of wrist action to get that to go quickly.

656
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,658
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but that arrow made that game.

657
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:48,143
Speaker 1: that arrow is good.

658
00:44:48,183 --> 00:44:50,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is it was really easy to catch.

659
00:44:50,631 --> 00:44:51,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's good.

660
00:44:51,674 --> 00:44:52,537
Speaker 1: You can't imagine going that.

661
00:44:52,738 --> 00:44:59,684
Speaker 0: I'm a big fan of the really simple because like simple just one touch You're out catching the other person's out four or five balls.

662
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:01,089
Speaker 0: and like ten people on a team

663
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:13,335
Speaker 1: I like having some of the complicated things, you know Cuz it sort of it sort of mixes it up gives you something interesting to think about like add some sort of you know strategic element there supposed to just the raw physical Dodging and catching.

664
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:21,350
Speaker 0: and there's so much strategy even in the raw game like for example All right, five balls, right if you've got an organized team and we would often plan this stuff in advance.

665
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:29,929
Speaker 0: We'd be like, all right we'd wait until we had like four of the balls on our side and usually at that point the other team realizes what's up and go crap and they hold on to that last ball.

666
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:31,575
Speaker 0: like What are we gonna do?

667
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:38,521
Speaker 0: and what we do is we'd go we'd shoot a volley The organized volley.

668
00:45:38,843 --> 00:45:44,350
Speaker 0: another great strategy We always had or we toss one up to get someone to go for a catch.

669
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:50,240
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, someone else had the little ball behind their back and as soon as the person's looking up to catch it Whap him in the face with that ball.

670
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:52,010
Speaker 0: They missed the ball in the air and they're out.

671
00:45:52,217 --> 00:46:00,990
Speaker 1: Yep Another good strategy we had is if you grab if you had a ball in your hands and someone threw a ball at you You could use it to bump that ball away.

672
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:01,934
Speaker 0: Yes, you could.

673
00:46:01,974 --> 00:46:02,456
Speaker 1: so it's like.

674
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:04,243
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna dodge throw that at me.

675
00:46:04,283 --> 00:46:09,900
Speaker 1: I dare you bump ha ha ha ha I'm using the ball as a shield and it's basically what you do.

676
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,570
Speaker 1: is you'd bump throw real quick while they weren't ready for it.

677
00:46:12,852 --> 00:46:17,689
Speaker 0: Well, no, don't bump throw Bump from the top down a little bit to bump it right back at him.

678
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:19,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that wouldn't really count.

679
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:21,447
Speaker 0: if you if they hit was he got to play with bounces.

680
00:46:21,728 --> 00:46:26,285
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I know the thing about playing with bounces is it's good and bad in a way.

681
00:46:26,506 --> 00:46:27,530
Speaker 0: I think it's nothing but good.

682
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,545
Speaker 0: I think it adds a lot to the game because then there's a lot more throws.

683
00:46:30,565 --> 00:46:31,449
Speaker 0: you can do a lot of moves.

684
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:32,695
Speaker 0: I like the idea of moves.

685
00:46:32,977 --> 00:46:33,801
Speaker 1: moves are okay.

686
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:34,504
Speaker 1: I like moves.

687
00:46:34,886 --> 00:46:35,469
Speaker 1: I like moves.

688
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:39,195
Speaker 0: But yes one one option.

689
00:46:39,215 --> 00:46:49,848
Speaker 0: we played a lot was we basically demarcate a circle, right and it was just either teams shirts and skins or every man for himself and that's it.

690
00:46:51,531 --> 00:46:52,695
Speaker 0: Then it gets crazy.

691
00:46:53,017 --> 00:46:54,241
Speaker 0: Someone's got a ball suddenly.

692
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:56,169
Speaker 0: There's basically a circle of people around him going.

693
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:56,510
Speaker 0: don't throw it.

694
00:46:57,456 --> 00:46:57,758
Speaker 1: We did.

695
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:05,249
Speaker 1: we did play circle dodgeball Which is where there's people standing around the circle and there's people in the circle and they the balls are coming at.

696
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:15,184
Speaker 1: you know There's balls two or three balls coming at you from all the people around the circle and they're throwing it at the people in the circle And if you get you're surrounded by people on all sides, so it's a game of.

697
00:47:15,505 --> 00:47:20,884
Speaker 1: it's coming at you from all 360 direction, you know degrees, you know, you got to dodge that shit.

698
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:31,250
Speaker 1: and then if you get hit, you know You got to go into the circle and now join the people, you know Attack the rest of the people still in the circle the other fun and the last person in the circle wins four square dodgeball.

699
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:35,950
Speaker 0: We're basically we just divide the gym into four equal corners and it was four teams playing dodgeball.

700
00:47:36,572 --> 00:47:41,030
Speaker 1: But the team diagonally from you would would sort of be like the last team sort of like warlords.

701
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:41,650
Speaker 0: Yeah.

702
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:46,078
Speaker 0: But at the same time if you were good enough You would eliminate the two teams either side.

703
00:47:46,098 --> 00:47:49,614
Speaker 0: if it came down to just two angle teams that we switch it to the whole gym Yep.

704
00:47:49,897 --> 00:47:50,119
Speaker 1: Yeah.

705
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's obvious.

706
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:53,789
Speaker 1: Dodgeball such a. I mean.

707
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:59,070
Speaker 1: There's something fundamental about the game of throw something at someone and try to hit them with it.

708
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:05,398
Speaker 1: It just allows for such a wide variety of games Without actually making a broken or stupid game.

709
00:48:05,438 --> 00:48:10,961
Speaker 1: because like the base concept is so good simple direct Competition between humans.

710
00:48:11,082 --> 00:48:12,189
Speaker 0: I very much enjoy.

711
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:12,710
Speaker 0: Yeah.

712
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:21,030
Speaker 0: Not indirect like two people running like a time trial but direct like two people Racing mountain bikes on the same single track.

713
00:48:21,218 --> 00:48:28,228
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like you have this sort of slight violent element to it which despite violence in general being abhorrent.

714
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:30,855
Speaker 1: is you know I mean violent cells right?

715
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:35,067
Speaker 0: possibly more so than say violence is abhorrent unless it's mutually consensual.

716
00:48:35,107 --> 00:48:35,829
Speaker 0: sport violence.

717
00:48:35,889 --> 00:48:39,523
Speaker 0: Yeah Hockey fires are so great because usually you want to fight.

718
00:48:39,744 --> 00:48:40,347
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

719
00:48:40,407 --> 00:48:44,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, and But at the same time no one's really getting hurt.

720
00:48:44,601 --> 00:48:45,545
Speaker 1: and it's kind of fun.

721
00:48:45,565 --> 00:48:50,972
Speaker 1: and you can be aggressive But you can also be defensive and it's not like I'm an offense now I'm a defense.

722
00:48:51,033 --> 00:48:53,282
Speaker 1: now you can play it as you go, you know, you can.

723
00:48:53,502 --> 00:48:55,772
Speaker 1: you can choose your own path you can.

724
00:48:55,792 --> 00:49:03,125
Speaker 0: problem is the best part of every game was always the initial moment when There's three balls lined up in the front and everyone starts to the back of their court.

725
00:49:03,345 --> 00:49:04,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like it's blown cuz.

726
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,480
Speaker 0: Usually there's always those few people who run for it.

727
00:49:09,312 --> 00:49:12,489
Speaker 0: But but and you always make the decision am I gonna run for it?

728
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:16,090
Speaker 1: What I would do is I would run for it right one time, right?

729
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:20,510
Speaker 1: I ran for it and I just ran as fast as I could because most people hesitate a little bit, right?

730
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:25,490
Speaker 1: I ran for it as fast as I could and when I got there, I just fucking kicked it really hard.

731
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,390
Speaker 0: Ha right.

732
00:49:26,732 --> 00:49:29,509
Speaker 1: So everyone just just like got out of the way like whoa.

733
00:49:29,811 --> 00:49:33,750
Speaker 1: Not because it would have counted because it kick doesn't count right slight kicks counted.

734
00:49:33,952 --> 00:49:36,290
Speaker 0: So the way we actually that was one of these strategies.

735
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:43,318
Speaker 1: It didn't matter if a kick counted or not because either way they tried that they dodged it because they didn't want to get hit By that because I kicked it really hard.

736
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:43,942
Speaker 1: that would have hurt.

737
00:49:44,102 --> 00:49:44,686
Speaker 0: but that was no.

738
00:49:44,706 --> 00:49:45,510
Speaker 0: that was our strategy.

739
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,517
Speaker 0: We say there were five balls up, right?

740
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:48,942
Speaker 0: We plan ahead of time.

741
00:49:49,424 --> 00:49:53,542
Speaker 0: five people will run Yeah And we'd pick which ball they're running to.

742
00:49:53,844 --> 00:50:04,270
Speaker 1: we'd always designate One person as he will kick the ball as cover for everyone else is gonna grab Yeah, so the fact that now the second time we did it they knew they thought that I was gonna kick it really hard.

743
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:14,735
Speaker 1: So when I ran full-on, no one went over there They sort of sort of shied away and I just talk I got I got close I walked up and I picked it up and I'm like, ah You know.

744
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:19,619
Speaker 1: and then of course the next time, you know It's sort of like the psychology of multiple rounds the rock-paper-scissors.

745
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:21,465
Speaker 1: psychology sets in.

746
00:50:21,505 --> 00:50:23,250
Speaker 1: so you got to stay one step ahead of the game.

747
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,090
Speaker 1: You know next time I don't run up really hard.

748
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:30,309
Speaker 1: I just sort of you know step a little bit and they go, huh, and then I run up and get it.

749
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:39,910
Speaker 0: Yep, the one strategy that was always key like my individual strategy was you know There's especially in gym dodgeball where everyone's kind of forced to play and there's always like half the people just don't want to be playing.

750
00:50:41,154 --> 00:50:43,601
Speaker 1: That is one problem I always had in gym classes.

751
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:51,668
Speaker 1: you since it's a class which is pretty much a Sized cross-section of you know your class of kids in school, right?

752
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,200
Speaker 1: There you're gonna get people who are really into it and people aren't.

753
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,730
Speaker 1: and really it would only be fun if everyone was in.

754
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,110
Speaker 0: But the trick was a lot of people would pick off the low-hanging fruit.

755
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:13,750
Speaker 1: No Leave hanging fruit to the end a screen or you bounce balls off of them and then you always get the stereotypical Situation of the one nerdy person who hates sports being all alone and dodgeball with everyone else on the other team.

756
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:14,214
Speaker 1: You know what?

757
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:19,913
Speaker 1: It sounds stereotypical, but it's So often especially, you know What it really happens.

758
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:25,070
Speaker 1: the most is when you get the kind of dodgeball where when you hit someone they come to your team.

759
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:27,980
Speaker 1: So one team that's winning just gets larger and larger.

760
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,024
Speaker 0: There's not a good way to play.

761
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,530
Speaker 1: the losing team gets smaller.

762
00:51:31,031 --> 00:51:39,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not the best way to play but it's quite humorous because it's the only one team of losers and one team of winners And then they just have fun picking off all the losers.

763
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:48,110
Speaker 0: I remember this one game who's in fifth grade and we were using our attrition strategy Which is we'd get all the balls or as many as we could and we'd throw a volley an event.

764
00:51:48,552 --> 00:51:51,630
Speaker 0: We only do this if we were up by it by at least like two people.

765
00:51:52,231 --> 00:51:58,349
Speaker 0: What we do is we'd all walk up to the front with all the balls pick one person and all throw with that person.

766
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:02,270
Speaker 0: now They might catch the one of the balls and one of us would be out but not the other one.

767
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:04,277
Speaker 0: They're definitely going to be out too.

768
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:10,557
Speaker 0: So basically every throw we would eliminate one more person But they wouldn't catch it every time.

769
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:15,190
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is there was this one kid who caught it every time.

770
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:15,471
Speaker 0: There are

771
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:27,468
Speaker 1: also those amazing moments in dodgeball where someone will catch more balls than it seems possible Like they catch a ball drop one and catch another one or they would catch one Put their arms out and catch another one between their

772
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:31,970
Speaker 0: arms Because most people they were afraid of getting out because they wanted to play.

773
00:52:32,512 --> 00:52:37,790
Speaker 0: So they were so afraid of the ball because they didn't want to get eliminated that they wouldn't go for the catch.

774
00:52:37,992 --> 00:52:39,987
Speaker 0: They'd be like, oh my god and try to dodge up.

775
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:40,792
Speaker 1: the worst Is it.

776
00:52:41,254 --> 00:52:44,950
Speaker 1: occasionally you would catch it and it would bounce out of you because you would do the chest catch.

777
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:50,322
Speaker 1: You know like you cup your arms and you catch it deep in there because you think it's gonna be a lock and then it Bounces out.

778
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:57,444
Speaker 0: No I always tell the good dodgeball players because they would put their hands out With both hands and hold it out in front of them.

779
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:57,927
Speaker 0: Yep.

780
00:52:58,349 --> 00:52:59,355
Speaker 1: Yep That's the way to do it.

781
00:52:59,557 --> 00:53:07,096
Speaker 0: or we had a couple of kids who were really good at volleyball And what they would do is when it came they'd bump it up and then someone else would catch it behind Every ball.

782
00:53:07,137 --> 00:53:11,700
Speaker 0: the one guy would stand in the front whenever they threw it He'd bump it up and then his friend behind would catch it.

783
00:53:12,384 --> 00:53:12,544
Speaker 0: Mmm.

784
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:13,650
Speaker 0: It was so perfect.

785
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:20,548
Speaker 0: There's a lot of good machine long debate in class where the gym teacher stops and we had to argue whether or not that was legitimate.

786
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:22,774
Speaker 1: It's good stuff.

787
00:53:23,035 --> 00:53:26,430
Speaker 0: of course that was only because we had a substitute gym teacher one day who was awesome.

788
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:29,483
Speaker 1: You know, maybe it's some anime convention or something.

789
00:53:29,503 --> 00:53:30,789
Speaker 1: We could have a dodgeball event.

790
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:34,376
Speaker 0: Most cons would not let us do that.

791
00:53:34,457 --> 00:53:37,810
Speaker 1: I know I know but I'm just if only we could do it at Otakon.

792
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:40,461
Speaker 0: You know, you know those kids are always fighting with the stupid sword.

793
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:42,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, they can play kendo out in that area.

794
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,796
Speaker 1: Why can't we play dodgeball?

795
00:53:43,816 --> 00:53:46,508
Speaker 0: Let's bring a kickball to Otakon and just see what happens.

796
00:53:47,673 --> 00:53:48,596
Speaker 0: I ordered a kickball.

797
00:53:48,836 --> 00:53:51,224
Speaker 1: So one is not enough that we need at least three.

798
00:53:51,244 --> 00:53:53,030
Speaker 0: We'll get some other people to bring.

799
00:53:53,391 --> 00:53:55,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, also they might go off the edge up there.

800
00:53:55,963 --> 00:53:57,510
Speaker 1: We might need to find a better place.

801
00:53:57,771 --> 00:53:59,036
Speaker 0: I think that place is fine.

802
00:53:59,056 --> 00:54:00,944
Speaker 1: You know, it might go over a pecs.

803
00:54:02,129 --> 00:54:04,345
Speaker 0: Oh Man, I'll bring it to play to dodgeball.

804
00:54:04,365 --> 00:54:08,342
Speaker 1: All right You got anything else to say about dodgeball then how awesome it is.

805
00:54:08,362 --> 00:54:10,010
Speaker 1: now everyone should play and it's a travesty.

806
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,176
Speaker 1: It's not played as much anymore.

807
00:54:11,196 --> 00:54:12,684
Speaker 0: I feel like in general.

808
00:54:12,845 --> 00:54:16,589
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know I actually have a somewhat tangent, but I'll go on this real quick.

809
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:21,730
Speaker 0: I feel and I made a thread about this that a lot of geeks and a lot of nerds.

810
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:23,250
Speaker 0: It's like they shoot sport.

811
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:55,060
Speaker 0: They're like ah sports and they get this bug up their butt like I don't like sports and usually it seems It's because they conflate the idea of physical fitness or sporting With bullies and that sort of thing because there is some a little bit of a correlation Partly just because of physicality of it, but I feel like a lot of geeks do themselves a grave Disservice by letting themselves become physically unfit or avoiding sports or physical competition because of these kind of Unrelated or conflated issues.

812
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not revenge of the nerds people.

813
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,655
Speaker 1: All right The Greeks had it right.

814
00:55:00,076 --> 00:55:04,750
Speaker 0: a well-rounded classical education is critical to being a good person.

815
00:55:04,911 --> 00:55:09,124
Speaker 0: Well, maybe not necessarily a good person because there were a lot of evil Greeks.

816
00:55:09,365 --> 00:55:11,050
Speaker 1: revenge of the nerds is the stereotype.

817
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,036
Speaker 1: You're not supposed to be the stereotype.

818
00:55:13,457 --> 00:55:16,987
Speaker 0: well-rounded education will do you nothing but good in the long run.

819
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:20,129
Speaker 1: I Mean look at all the things that you you know, look around.

820
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:22,810
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you might be a geek and dislike sports.

821
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:26,682
Speaker 1: But you probably think martial arts are cool and you probably think hockey is cool.

822
00:55:26,702 --> 00:55:27,805
Speaker 1: And you probably.

823
00:55:27,965 --> 00:55:31,854
Speaker 1: you probably think that Parkour is cool.

824
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,978
Speaker 0: do parkour.

825
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,127
Speaker 0: It's well, I was about to say it's easy.

826
00:55:35,187 --> 00:55:35,970
Speaker 0: No, it's not easy.

827
00:55:36,171 --> 00:55:38,949
Speaker 1: No, it's easy to get into it's easy to try.

828
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:43,425
Speaker 0: Well, you just got to start small yeah, and then we'll jump a little skateboarding.

829
00:55:43,545 --> 00:55:44,870
Speaker 1: right nerd is nerd sport.

830
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:47,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the skateboard nerds are.

831
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,286
Speaker 0: the snowboarding is nervous for it of themselves.

832
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,777
Speaker 1: I know I know I don't know about snowboarding.

833
00:55:51,797 --> 00:55:53,204
Speaker 0: I've never seen anyone actually do it.

834
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:54,430
Speaker 1: You never seen anyone snow?

835
00:55:54,430 --> 00:56:06,596
Speaker 0: No, no see that's a joke right because any time in my whole life when I was a kid and I'd go skiing and then when I Finally started skiing in last year the one time I went skiing see if I could still do it Snowboarders were never snowboarding.

836
00:56:06,837 --> 00:56:13,518
Speaker 0: They're always sitting halfway down like the bunny hill on their asses talking Yeah, never were they actually snowboard.

837
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:15,464
Speaker 1: I've seen him on TV in half.

838
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:15,825
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

839
00:56:15,845 --> 00:56:16,046
Speaker 0: Yeah.

840
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:17,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just I don't know.

841
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:21,949
Speaker 0: I really don't think snowboarding is that fun compared to skiing cuz it's a lot slower and you can't do as much.

842
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:22,814
Speaker 1: Yeah.

843
00:56:22,975 --> 00:56:23,177
Speaker 1: Yeah.

844
00:56:23,378 --> 00:56:25,310
Speaker 0: Anyway, you can do the little tricks and stuff, which is cool.

845
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,901
Speaker 1: But I like that 1080 snowboarding video game for the n64.

846
00:56:27,921 --> 00:56:28,705
Speaker 1: That was good.

847
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:29,870
Speaker 0: It was actually a pretty damn good.

848
