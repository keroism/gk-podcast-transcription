1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,137
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, August 21st, 2014.

2
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:10,579
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:14,467
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,510
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,590
Speaker 0: The angry video game nerd.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,777
Speaker 0: The movie.

7
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,170
Speaker 0: The experience.

8
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:24,628
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,420
Speaker 0: So, every year since the year 2000, I've gone to the Wildwoods, particularly North Wildwood.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:33,762
Speaker 0: Really?

11
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:34,186
Speaker 1: Even the year 2000?

12
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:35,740
Speaker 1: It wasn't 2001 or 2002?

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,266
Speaker 1: The first year.

14
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:37,340
Speaker 0: That first summer.

15
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,380
Speaker 1: I don't remember it being 2000.

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,721
Speaker 1: Maybe it was 2001.

17
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:41,609
Speaker 1: I graduated high school in 2000, so I guess that was the summer.

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,280
Speaker 0: So yeah, it was '01, because it was the summer after our freshman year.

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,779
Speaker 1: It had to at least be '01 at the earliest.

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,920
Speaker 0: Yep, because it was the summer after our freshman year.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,173
Speaker 0: Yeah.

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,472
Speaker 0: So, I've gone there every year, and it's this beach that I just love going to.

23
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:00,039
Speaker 1: It's not the greatest.

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,180
Speaker 0: Within a four-hour drive of New York City, there are almost no, I can name no better public beach on an ocean.

25
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:11,752
Speaker 1: I mean, beach-wise, right?

26
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:13,040
Speaker 1: If you discount the people on the beach.

27
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:14,549
Speaker 0: I'm just talking about the beach.

28
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,360
Speaker 0: When did I say anything but the beach?

29
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:17,804
Speaker 1: It's nice.

30
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,299
Speaker 1: There's nice sands and nice waters.

31
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:19,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,900
Speaker 1: Nice times, and there's some good stuff there.

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,879
Speaker 0: There's those little birds.

34
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:28,260
Speaker 1: And there's a nice bookstore, and a nice alumni grill.

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,214
Speaker 1: Nice Russos.

36
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:31,080
Speaker 1: Good times.

37
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, that Wawa right there that was replaced by the bigger Wawa.

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the Boardwalk.

39
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,417
Speaker 0: The Boardwalk has gone downhill, which is interesting.

40
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:43,380
Speaker 1: Every single year it's gone downhill, and it hasn't gone uphill in any way.

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,380
Speaker 0: But it's only gone downhill relative to what we want out of it.

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,618
Speaker 0: Because what did we want out of it?

43
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:50,018
Speaker 1: Arcades with decent games.

44
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,440
Speaker 0: And literally, the garbage-ist of the garbage pizza.

45
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:59,000
Speaker 1: And even one place to look at something remotely nerdy.

46
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:00,900
Speaker 1: Anything.

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,460
Speaker 0: Yep, but every year there were fewer arcades, and now the arcades are just dead.

48
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:06,479
Speaker 0: There's literally...

49
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,337
Speaker 1: There used to be a comic shop?

50
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:07,500
Speaker 1: Nope.

51
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,020
Speaker 0: There used to be like 15 or 16 DDR machines on that Boardwalk.

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,660
Speaker 0: I'm not even joking or exaggerating.

53
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:14,477
Speaker 1: And now, you're lucky if you can find one.

54
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,880
Speaker 0: Yep, there was one broken pump-it-up machine, and one in the groove machine that was too quiet and you couldn't hear it last year.

55
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:29,580
Speaker 1: The only current saving grace is that the place that used to have Fist of the North Star, which is not there anymore, now has play old pinball machines unlimitedly, basically.

56
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're talking old, like made-out-of-wood pinball machines.

57
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,980
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure every pinball machine, even the newest ones, is somewhat made out of wood.

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,880
Speaker 0: The flappers were made out of wood on a bunch of these things.

59
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,358
Speaker 0: Mechanical scoreboards.

60
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,039
Speaker 1: Yes, the good kind.

61
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what?

62
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,479
Speaker 0: You know how we always talk about how our one, like the biggest regret we both have in life, is not going to PAX as sooner than we did?

63
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:59,960
Speaker 0: I do have a second, like my second regret in life on that list, is not buying that Fist of the North Star cabinet when it was on sale.

64
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:02,098
Speaker 1: I do not regret not buying that.

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,451
Speaker 0: Come on, it was like 800 bucks.

66
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,579
Speaker 1: Okay, and getting it somewhere and keeping it somewhere, etc.

67
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,820
Speaker 0: If I saw that machine on sale in Wildwood for 800 bucks today, I would buy it and deal with all those consequences later.

68
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,339
Speaker 1: And it barely worked, and where would you put it?

69
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:18,280
Speaker 0: I would have fixed it, because that would have been awesome.

70
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,231
Speaker 0: Where would I put it?

71
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:19,759
Speaker 0: Living room.

72
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,559
Speaker 1: There's nowhere to put it in there.

73
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,520
Speaker 0: I could fit it in there.

74
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,539
Speaker 1: That would take up your whole living room.

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,499
Speaker 0: It's not that big.

76
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,820
Speaker 1: It would have to also be your television.

77
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:27,720
Speaker 1: It would be a vertical television.

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,060
Speaker 0: I would replace the wine cabinet.

79
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:30,660
Speaker 1: You could only watch it laying on your side.

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,660
Speaker 0: I could replace the piano or the wine cabinet.

81
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,800
Speaker 1: You could replace the piano, then no one can sit at the table.

82
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:39,859
Speaker 0: I just really want that thing.

83
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,391
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really want a DDR machine.

84
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:43,360
Speaker 1: You don't see me buying one.

85
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:48,859
Speaker 0: I had to book a place, because for the first time, I'm not just staying at a friend's house, because the friend had a baby.

86
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:54,879
Speaker 1: I feel like half the reason to go is because all these people I know are going, and spending time with them.

87
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,000
Speaker 0: Some of those people are going anyway, so that friend is going regardless.

88
00:03:59,363 --> 00:03:59,799
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

89
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:04,860
Speaker 0: But arriving Saturday, because for them, a day trip's fine, but a day trip for us sucks.

90
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:07,780
Speaker 0: So he's going to be there Saturday afternoon.

91
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,080
Speaker 1: Then why are you booking a place?

92
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,260
Speaker 0: Because we want to get there Friday.

93
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,880
Speaker 1: Okay, but he's only getting the place Friday?

94
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,076
Speaker 0: No, I'm going to Saturday, too.

95
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:15,528
Speaker 0: All right.

96
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:20,079
Speaker 0: Solves a few problems logistically and all that, but regardless.

97
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:33,120
Speaker 0: It's been a long time since I've had to arrange transportation, or hotels, or order food in a place where no one knows how to use the internet.

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,240
Speaker 0: Good God, can you not?

99
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,659
Speaker 0: I had to call hotels and be like, "What do your rooms cost?

100
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:42,620
Speaker 0: Do you have one available on this weekend?

101
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:43,747
Speaker 0: Do you have

102
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:44,010
Speaker 0: parking?".

103
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:46,730
Speaker 0: A lot of these people don't even have email addresses.

104
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,190
Speaker 0: Every hotel there, if they have a website, has a rates page.

105
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:53,516
Speaker 0: that is their gigantic page.

106
00:04:53,557 --> 00:05:01,529
Speaker 0: that explains this really convoluted system for what their rooms cost, and there's no way to know if they have vacancies or not other than calling them.

107
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:03,690
Speaker 0: A few places have email addresses.

108
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:15,158
Speaker 1: Let's contrast this to Australia, where we stayed at an equally tiny motel on some island in the off-season, and not only were we able to handle that entire thing technologically,

109
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:16,163
Speaker 0: but

110
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:24,028
Speaker 1: the dude, when we showed up there in the little motel office in the front, was able to use the internet on some sort of local island land

111
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:24,310
Speaker 0: or something.

112
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was like, "Here's the tide schedule in case you go

113
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:27,109
Speaker 0: hiking.".

114
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:33,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, he knew when the boat that went out to look at the seals was coming and leaving, a daily report came in.

115
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,289
Speaker 0: Yep, when he said, "One moment, let me see what the schedule

116
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,410
Speaker 0: is.".

117
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:44,730
Speaker 1: We could buy tickets to anything on the whole island at any other place on the island because they all partnered with each other technologically.

118
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,344
Speaker 0: Seriously though, and I was like, "Oh, maybe I'll just do

119
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:49,585
Speaker 0: Airbnb.".

120
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:53,825
Speaker 0: No one in Wildwood uses Airbnb.

121
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:54,669
Speaker 0: Zero.

122
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:03,490
Speaker 1: I feel like if you bought a hotel and just made it internet-y, that you could basically fill up immediately because you would get all the business from anyone who was internet-y.

123
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,925
Speaker 0: So I discovered something, and I kind of want to do some investigative journalism on this because I just booked directly with hotels on their websites.

124
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:09,529
Speaker 0: That's what you do.

125
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:14,130
Speaker 0: So I looked on Hotels.com, like one of those kinds of sites.

126
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,190
Speaker 1: Or Priceline or one of those.

127
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,590
Speaker 0: And they listed a lot of these hotels that don't have online registration.

128
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:26,130
Speaker 0: And they listed them at prices that were like $200+ above the rate if you call the hotel directly.

129
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:36,099
Speaker 0: I think these hotels are just smart enough to make a room online somewhere with a ridiculous price that no one will ever reserve.

130
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,870
Speaker 0: because if someone does, jackpot!

131
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:44,490
Speaker 0: And if no one does, free advertisement for the hotel on the site that internet people are looking at.

132
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,070
Speaker 1: You're neglecting another possibility.

133
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:59,850
Speaker 1: The Priceline, or whoever what site it is, sees this hotel as not internet-y and just fucking lists it at a ridiculous price, and if you buy it, that money is like a service charge that uses for them to deal with the bullshit of calling the hotel.

134
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:09,510
Speaker 0: You know, it is also possible, but based on reading some reviews people had on other sites, I saw that a common refrain... These hotels are like...

135
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:13,189
Speaker 1: I registered for this hotel at Hotels.com and I got there and they didn't know who I was?

136
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:19,717
Speaker 0: It was more the hotels themselves responding on like Yelp saying, "Yeah, just call us direct.

137
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,825
Speaker 0: Don't use the room that we put up on

138
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:22,688
Speaker 0: whatever.com.".

139
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:24,906
Speaker 0: So I think the hotels do it.

140
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,410
Speaker 0: No, it's weird.

141
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:44,010
Speaker 0: It's weird when I interact with a small business that seems to be like family-run, or the people who run it take things personally and take a personal interest in these really low-level things, and I kind of actually really prefer the faceless corporate interactions in these situations.

142
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,450
Speaker 1: That's why it's much better to have the management company and not a landlord as a human being.

143
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:58,729
Speaker 0: I like the fact that while we've had issues with our apartment, our landlord is a faceless company that gives zero fucks about us, which means they don't pry too much into my business.

144
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:03,110
Speaker 0: Unlike some other friends we know and their landlord issues.

145
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:18,010
Speaker 0: So yeah, the moral of the story, it really sucks when businesses don't do stuff on the internet, and there is a divide between businesses that are internet and businesses that are not, and I think the place that's happening first...

146
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,590
Speaker 1: There's a divide between the world that is internet and the world that is not.

147
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:30,070
Speaker 0: But in the US, like in New York, I think in the next few years, low, crappy-level Chinese places that aren't on Grubhub are just going out of business, unless they're in Chinatown.

148
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,110
Speaker 0: I think bit by bit, things that you can't order online are invisible.

149
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,052
Speaker 1: Maybe.

150
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:37,110
Speaker 1: Anyway.

151
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,481
Speaker 1: Anyway.

152
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:47,322
Speaker 1: So remember that deal where the guy was really upset, everyone was using his monkey photo on Wikipedia, and some of the Wikipedia editors were like, "We've got to take this down,".

153
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:50,767
Speaker 1: and some of them were like, "No, a monkey took the picture, therefore it

154
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:51,149
Speaker 1: stays.".

155
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:54,448
Speaker 0: And there was a pretty good debate in our forum about that shit, too.

156
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:03,930
Speaker 1: The Wikipedia people were fighting with each other, and then I guess the people on Wikipedia decided it would stay up, one, in the Wikipedia community, and then in our community.

157
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:13,910
Speaker 1: And it's like, while I'm not really a copyright fan, I was actually siding on, look, this dude set this shit up, right?

158
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:17,950
Speaker 1: He didn't take that specific picture, but he set this up.

159
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:20,869
Speaker 1: His effort went towards creating this thing.

160
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:29,770
Speaker 0: I could, for example-- Well, I think Luke Burge and a couple other people, they pointed out there's a common precedent for setting a trap that automatically takes a picture.

161
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:31,490
Speaker 0: The trap doesn't get copyrighted.

162
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:36,090
Speaker 1: If I use a lightning trigger to take lightning photos-- The lightning gets the copyright.

163
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,474
Speaker 1: Right.

164
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:37,044
Speaker 1: That's ridiculous.

165
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,490
Speaker 1: It's really hard to fucking take lightning photos.

166
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,370
Speaker 0: If I spend the money for a lightning trigger and set that shit up-- I want to send you a cease and desist from an individual photon.

167
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,170
Speaker 1: And set the exposure for the skyline and whatever.

168
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,490
Speaker 1: If you believe in copyright, which, you know, we're not going to discuss that right now.

169
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,190
Speaker 1: We're just assuming copyright is what it is and we believe in it.

170
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,652
Speaker 1: I believe

171
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:57,972
Speaker 0: in copyright in the same way that I believe-- We believe

172
00:09:57,992 --> 00:10:00,211
Speaker 1: in the current copyright law that exists in the U.S No, I'm

173
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:06,110
Speaker 0: saying I believe in it in the same sense that I believe that I'm holding a screw in my hand right now and a hair tie.

174
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,930
Speaker 0: Those are physical things that exist.

175
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,562
Speaker 1: If you agree with current U.S.

176
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:18,790
Speaker 1: copyright policy, under that law and policy, me doing that thing with the lightning trigger, I should own the copyright on that and be able to make money by selling that picture.

177
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,509
Speaker 1: That was quite a pain in the ass to take.

178
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,370
Speaker 1: It cost money, time, and effort.

179
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:24,030
Speaker 1: You know, it's not trivial.

180
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:32,770
Speaker 1: So, I was actually saying, well, yeah, you know, morally, whatever, copyright, I don't think anyone should copyright some freaking photo of a monkey, whatever.

181
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:39,190
Speaker 1: But, if you are going to say copyright, I was on his side that like, yeah, you own that monkey photo, dude.

182
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,270
Speaker 1: So I wasn't-- Just because a monkey pushed the button.

183
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,149
Speaker 0: But I'm going to say this.

184
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:49,290
Speaker 0: The only reason I wasn't is because I wanted to see a hilarious and fundamentally shaking court case.

185
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,810
Speaker 0: I wanted to see some weird, crazy challenge to copyright law.

186
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,769
Speaker 0: That's the only reason.

187
00:10:54,331 --> 00:11:16,490
Speaker 1: So, today, the Copyright Office, which I think is actually part of the Library of Congress, it's a weird thing, anyway, they released their third edition of their official practices, which is sort of a law, but part of it is a thing that says, here are the guidelines for what we will and will not register as copyrightable.

188
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,289
Speaker 1: And so, registering a copyright is not something you have to do.

189
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,590
Speaker 1: If you just make some art, like you just take some paint and throw it to canvas, you own the copyright on that.

190
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,569
Speaker 0: Copyright is automatic and intrinsic.

191
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:39,050
Speaker 1: You don't have to do anything, but if you do register it, which is optional, then that gives you some extra benefits, such as, you know, it gives you the right to sue and receive statutory damages.

192
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,590
Speaker 0: As opposed to just direct damages.

193
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,409
Speaker 1: As opposed to other damages, right?

194
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:52,830
Speaker 1: So, anyway, in this new official practices third edition, they gave some examples of things that they will not register.

195
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:55,990
Speaker 1: The first example is a photograph taken by a monkey.

196
00:11:56,772 --> 00:12:04,330
Speaker 1: Other examples include a mural painted by an elephant, because there is an elephant that paints, a claim based on the appearance of actual animal skin.

197
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:12,770
Speaker 1: So, it's like, I guess, if you see an animal and there's some art shaped in its skin, or like a cow where the black spot in the cow is shaped like something.

198
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,190
Speaker 0: Check out my cat that looks exactly like the Mona Lisa.

199
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:17,812
Speaker 1: Right.

200
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:20,750
Speaker 1: A claim based on driftwood that has been shaped and moved by the ocean.

201
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,510
Speaker 1: So, you find a piece of driftwood that just happens to be incredibly awesomely shaped.

202
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:26,109
Speaker 1: It was done by the ocean.

203
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,510
Speaker 1: A claim based on cut marks, defects, and other qualities found in natural stones.

204
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:37,190
Speaker 1: You find a rock that's just awesome, and you just try to copyright the shape of that rock, because it's an awesome, you know, make it tricky.

205
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,041
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, I found this rock.

206
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:40,450
Speaker 1: This is a sculpture that I made.

207
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,998
Speaker 0: I didn't read the whole thing.

208
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,970
Speaker 0: Did they give just examples or rationale?

209
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,350
Speaker 1: No, this is the list I'm seeing here, but it's like, this is a list of things they will not register.

210
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:58,890
Speaker 0: I was wondering what the rationale was, and I suspect that the monkey example, if that's actually in there, was added because of the current discussions.

211
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:07,349
Speaker 1: It just says, the law only protects the fruits of intellectual labor that are founded in the creative powers of the mind.

212
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,488
Speaker 1: Original intellectual conceptions of the author.

213
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:19,550
Speaker 1: If a human being did not create the work, the office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants.

214
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:34,310
Speaker 1: Likewise, the office cannot register a work purportedly created by divine or supernatural beings, although the office may register a work where the application or the deposit copies state that the work was inspired by a divine spirit.

215
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:44,909
Speaker 0: I was going to go with a much more direct challenge under the idea that they would have to argue whether or not the photographer intended to take the picture of the monkey or not.

216
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:48,290
Speaker 0: Like, did he leave it there for the monkey to find, or did the monkey just find it?

217
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:56,610
Speaker 1: I'm sure he intended for monkeys to come and take the picture, but that specific picture of monkey taking that pose was just, you know, the luck of the draw, right?

218
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,879
Speaker 1: He was going to get monkey pictures.

219
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,470
Speaker 1: He set it up as a monkey trap.

220
00:13:59,690 --> 00:13:59,872
Speaker 0: Maybe.

221
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,490
Speaker 0: He could have just been killed by monkeys.

222
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:13,890
Speaker 1: It's like, if I take pictures of lightning with a lightning trigger, it's like, yeah, I intended to take pictures of lightning in that frame with this exposure, but did I know that exact lightning bolt shape was going to happen?

223
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:14,692
Speaker 1: No.

224
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:15,538
Speaker 1: I can't.

225
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,189
Speaker 1: I'm not supposed to control the fucking light, Thor.

226
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:19,590
Speaker 1: If I was Thor, I wouldn't need a lightning trigger.

227
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,885
Speaker 1: I would just push the button and swing my hammer at the same time, right?

228
00:14:25,012 --> 00:14:27,130
Speaker 1: And the lightning would come down exactly the shape I want.

229
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,890
Speaker 1: It would be the big lightning, penis-shaped lightning.

230
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,429
Speaker 1: I get the greatest photo of all time.

231
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,709
Speaker 0: So this actually might have some interesting far-reaching consequences.

232
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:36,852
Speaker 1: It does.

233
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:42,474
Speaker 1: I wonder how many copyrighted things now we can just fucking say, "Oh, that's public domain.

234
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:45,590
Speaker 1: Fuck you," because it was made by animals or nature or something.

235
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,890
Speaker 0: Well, you know, there was another argument, too.

236
00:14:48,131 --> 00:15:01,510
Speaker 0: I was making a very side argument in the forum just for fun, that because of the debate around the picture, most uses of the picture were therefore fair use in discussion of the picture itself, because the picture was newsworthy and notable.

237
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:02,147
Speaker 1: Sure.

238
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,390
Speaker 0: So that was just kind of a side step.

239
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,389
Speaker 0: That's the kind of bullshit that the Supreme Court would do if they didn't want to rule on the actual issue.

240
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:10,988
Speaker 1: Anyway, so there you go.

241
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,909
Speaker 0: So I got a crazy story for you guys.

242
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,077
Speaker 0: So this is on FARC.

243
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:17,930
Speaker 0: I found this news, but this is legitimate news.

244
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:21,450
Speaker 0: A guy, I guess he's in the sneaker trade.

245
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,830
Speaker 0: Like, you know those kids who line up and buy those ridiculous, expensive sneakers?

246
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,270
Speaker 1: Oh, so he lines up, buys them, and sells them for more on eBay?

247
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:34,029
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what he actually does, but he's involved in that, and he went to his sneaker convention, and he made a lot of money at it doing his thing.

248
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,389
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I mean, that's his deal.

249
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,587
Speaker 0: So he posted on, it looks like, they say social media.

250
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,330
Speaker 0: I think it's Facebook.

251
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,437
Speaker 0: A picture of the money.

252
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,030
Speaker 0: It's a lot of money.

253
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,049
Speaker 1: Oh, it's all cash.

254
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:47,388
Speaker 0: It looks like 20, 25 grand just based on this photo.

255
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,750
Speaker 1: Now he's going to get robbed?

256
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,230
Speaker 0: He got murdered and robbed the next night after he posted the photo.

257
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, good job, dude.

258
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, the moral is, if you have 20 to 25 thousand dollars in cash...

259
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,749
Speaker 1: Armored car, bank, you know the bank has that weird thing, that metal thing?

260
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,730
Speaker 0: If you take a picture of it, post it to social media after you took it to the bank.

261
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,829
Speaker 1: Listen, someone might come...

262
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,530
Speaker 0: But that would not have stopped him from being murdered.

263
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,869
Speaker 1: Someone might come and murder you anyway, and then look for the money, and they can't find it.

264
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:20,769
Speaker 0: So, what's worse is that, I'm reading some follow-up here, because the story has more info since when I was first looking at it.

265
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:31,970
Speaker 0: The person who shot him and went to steal the money may have been there trying to steal his shoes instead, and may not have known about the money.

266
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:34,009
Speaker 1: Oh, and the money's still there?

267
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:48,590
Speaker 0: There's a, Fark is speculating that the guy might have sold shoes to this kid, and then when he saw the picture, became enraged that the kid made a lot of money and might have paid him a couple hundred bucks for these multi-thousand dollar shoes or something.

268
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,430
Speaker 0: But, I don't know, I have no idea.

269
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,150
Speaker 0: This is the kind of story where you will literally never find out what actually happened.

270
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:02,650
Speaker 0: But the moral is, if you have tens of thousands of dollars of cash, do not take a picture of it and just post it publicly on social media.

271
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,750
Speaker 1: I got two better morals.

272
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:09,770
Speaker 1: Moral number one, don't be involved in shady, stupid businesses like selling ridiculously overpriced sneakers.

273
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:18,170
Speaker 1: Number two, if you want someone to get killed, take a picture of money, hack their Twitter, just find out their password.

274
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,609
Speaker 1: You know, you can't hack this, right?

275
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:28,668
Speaker 1: Find out their password, post it on their Twitter with the GPS location of their house, and hope someone comes and robs them and kills them, and then you'll get away with it.

276
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:33,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that's just a twist on the old put child porn on someone's computer gag.

277
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:35,929
Speaker 1: It doesn't end with them dead.

278
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,370
Speaker 0: It ends up with them in jail forever.

279
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:40,570
Speaker 1: Maybe.

280
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:46,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, how Monte Cristoian is your revenge at this point?

281
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:56,950
Speaker 0: So things of the day!

282
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:00,390
Speaker 0: This is utterly, utterly wonderful.

283
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:07,830
Speaker 0: So apparently, people in Bulgaria are vandalizing old monuments to Soviet bullshit.

284
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:15,610
Speaker 1: Okay, well I mean, come on, if there were British monuments lying about in the US, and it was still, I mean, remember, this is recent history.

285
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:16,349
Speaker 0: Yes, and Britain.

286
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:17,361
Speaker 0: So in 1790-something.

287
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,365
Speaker 0: And Britain was being a punk on the international scene to us.

288
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:29,309
Speaker 1: Right, so it's 1790, you're in the US, there's British monuments, and you still don't like Britain and you live in the US, you are vandalizing the fuck out of those.

289
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:31,770
Speaker 0: So that is what's happening in Bulgaria.

290
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:33,029
Speaker 1: Of course, why wouldn't it?

291
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:44,650
Speaker 0: What these vandals are doing is painting statues that are parts of these monuments to be superheroes, like Superman and the Joker and Robin and Wonder Woman and Captain America.

292
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,329
Speaker 1: So not only are they vandalizing, they're excellent vandalizing.

293
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,590
Speaker 0: This is so high quality.

294
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,790
Speaker 0: My hat is off to you, Bulgarian punk kids with spray paint.

295
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:56,550
Speaker 0: These are amazing.

296
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:04,550
Speaker 0: And also, what's even more hilarious, Russia is legit angry about this and is demanding that Bulgaria take action.

297
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,770
Speaker 1: Demanding this other country take action to do something about some other person.

298
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,626
Speaker 1: It's like, you left, you gave me something, or I took it back from you.

299
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,590
Speaker 1: that was rightfully mine.

300
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,409
Speaker 1: It's in my house, and you don't like how I'm using it.

301
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:28,829
Speaker 1: I got my NES, it's actually your NES that you stole, and I got it back, and I'm playing Mega Man, and you're like, "Stop playing Mega Man on my NES.

302
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,305
Speaker 1: Buy the commando

303
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:30,668
Speaker 1: only.".

304
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:37,767
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "I'm in my house with my NES now, just because it used to be yours, because you were pointing a gun at

305
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:37,868
Speaker 1: me.".

306
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:40,190
Speaker 0: So there's a similar war crimes.

307
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,750
Speaker 1: I'm going to play Mega Man 2 extra, just to piss you off more.

308
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:48,248
Speaker 0: There is a war crime/monument incident that happened to me as a kid involving Mega Man 3. that's very relevant to this.

309
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:49,350
Speaker 1: War crimes?

310
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,830
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid, there was a kid in my neighborhood who was kind of a little shit.

311
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:54,236
Speaker 1: Okay.

312
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,482
Speaker 0: And there was another kid who was a...

313
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,570
Speaker 1: Did he get shot, because is it true?

314
00:19:59,710 --> 00:19:59,817
Speaker 0: No, no.

315
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:09,990
Speaker 0: So the other kid was one of those horrific lower-middle-class bullies, like stereotype to a T of this particular kind of bully.

316
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,169
Speaker 1: Like, was he like on The Simpsons, was he Nelson going, "Heh, heh,".

317
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,989
Speaker 1: or was he the older kids?

318
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,029
Speaker 0: He was more like Jimbo.

319
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:23,950
Speaker 0: So that kid actually, unrelatedly, was eventually shot to death by his mother after him and his father tried to light her car on fire.

320
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,290
Speaker 0: I learned that like five years after the fact.

321
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:27,188
Speaker 1: So, yeah, Jimbo.

322
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, beside the point.

323
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:42,329
Speaker 0: So the little shit one day came over to my house, and I'd hang out with this kid occasionally, just because, you know, when you're a kid in like middle school, you kind of hang out with a lot of kids in the neighborhood, regardless of whether or not you like them.

324
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:47,430
Speaker 0: This little shit was the kid who, like, we'd have a super soaker war, he'd show up with a super soaker backpack.

325
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, that means he had money.

326
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,439
Speaker 0: He did.

327
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:53,250
Speaker 0: So one day he comes over and we're playing NES games.

328
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,248
Speaker 1: More parents who spoiled him.

329
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,807
Speaker 0: And then he was like, "Hey, you want a trade

330
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:57,170
Speaker 0: game?".

331
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,650
Speaker 0: And he's holding Hydlide.

332
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,155
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Maybe.

333
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:05,748
Speaker 0: What do you want for that Mega Man

334
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:06,733
Speaker 0: 3?".

335
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:11,565
Speaker 0: And he looks down at the Hydlide he's holding, and he's like, "I'll trade you my Mega Man 3 for this

336
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:12,027
Speaker 0: game.".

337
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:13,890
Speaker 0: He'd never played Hydlide.

338
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,450
Speaker 0: He was looking just at the cover.

339
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:18,611
Speaker 0: So I said, "Yes," and I took Mega Man 3.

340
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,390
Speaker 1: And you gave him Hydlide?

341
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:20,289
Speaker 0: Gave him Hydlide.

342
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,282
Speaker 0: So you didn't get ripped off.

343
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:21,910
Speaker 1: He got ripped off.

344
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:22,728
Speaker 0: He got ripped off.

345
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:23,634
Speaker 0: So...

346
00:21:24,053 --> 00:21:24,570
Speaker 1: He got pissed.

347
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:29,970
Speaker 0: So then, later, he's over at our house, and I'm playing Mega Man 3, and I'm just cheating.

348
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,050
Speaker 0: So I'm doing that thing where you use the second controller, just like that awesome glitch.

349
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,810
Speaker 0: And he got really mad that I was playing the game wrong.

350
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:39,830
Speaker 0: And he wanted to trade back.

351
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,695
Speaker 0: And I was like, "No.

352
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:41,722
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

353
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:42,326
Speaker 0: We made a trade.

354
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:42,487
Speaker 0: It's

355
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:42,748
Speaker 0: over.".

356
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:43,490
Speaker 0: It's over.

357
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,388
Speaker 0: I'm sorry Hydlide sucks, but...

358
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:47,529
Speaker 1: You made mistakes were made.

359
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:49,149
Speaker 1: And they're gonna stay made.

360
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:56,088
Speaker 0: So then, the next day, the other bad kids, like, Jimbo's mom comes over.

361
00:21:56,792 --> 00:22:00,788
Speaker 0: And Jimbo's mom says that we stole something from her son.

362
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,830
Speaker 1: Oh, so the little shit took the Mega Man 3?

363
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,350
Speaker 0: The little shit had acquired that Mega Man 3 under dubious pretense and traded it to me for Hydlide.

364
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,130
Speaker 1: So he stole it from Jimbo and traded it to you for Hydlide.

365
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:18,330
Speaker 0: Yes, and then had the gall to try to get it back from me by claiming, falsely, that I was playing the game incorrectly.

366
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,310
Speaker 0: Take that, Russia.

367
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,890
Speaker 1: So you kept the Mega Man 3?

368
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:38,910
Speaker 0: Actually, because it appeared to be stolen, and because the advice that my dad gave me, which applies to times we've interacted with people in Beacon, is someone and/or their family poor and has likely nothing to lose of value?

369
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,649
Speaker 0: Do not antagonize them, even if you are correct.

370
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:46,189
Speaker 0: Because they will explode themselves to explode on you.

371
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:50,411
Speaker 1: Did your parents then buy you a Mega Man 3?

372
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,670
Speaker 0: I bought Mega Man 3 at a garage sale for, like, 20 bucks, three or four months later.

373
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,041
Speaker 1: There you go.

374
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:11,950
Speaker 0: But it's kind of like if someone crazy in a beat-up car messes with you and maybe bumps your car and runs away, if you call the police and try to sue them, and they find out who you are, they're going to key your car and egg your house for the rest of the time you live in that neighborhood.

375
00:23:13,752 --> 00:23:16,390
Speaker 0: So anyway, you got a thing of the day?

376
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,589
Speaker 1: I do have a thing of the day.

377
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,690
Speaker 0: After my long, rambling anecdote?

378
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,950
Speaker 1: So America's Test Kitchen did some testing, and they found something fascinating.

379
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:25,987
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.

380
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,230
Speaker 1: They saw it and I found it fascinating.

381
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,269
Speaker 1: So, steak.

382
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,430
Speaker 1: The thing that has been studied perhaps more than any other food ever.

383
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,750
Speaker 1: Common sense would be, if you have a steak and it's fresh, you just fucking cook that shit.

384
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,002
Speaker 0: No, you age steaks.

385
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:38,750
Speaker 0: That's common knowledge.

386
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,548
Speaker 1: Well, also that.

387
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,610
Speaker 1: But the point is, you cook it fresh.

388
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:43,710
Speaker 1: And they agree that is the best way.

389
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:44,869
Speaker 1: You cook a fresh steak.

390
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:45,264
Speaker 0: Okay.

391
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:50,008
Speaker 1: Let's say you have just too much steak, and you must freeze it.

392
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:59,269
Speaker 1: The common sense would be, if you have a steak that you had to freeze, you don't want to freeze it if you don't have to, but if you had to freeze it, you have a frozen steak already and you want to cook it.

393
00:23:59,630 --> 00:23:59,705
Speaker 0: Yep.

394
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,810
Speaker 1: People, the common sense would be that you would thaw that shit to bring it to room temperature and then cook it.

395
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,130
Speaker 0: That is in fact what most of my cookbooks recommend.

396
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,577
Speaker 1: That is what almost everyone... America's Test Kitchen tested.

397
00:24:15,863 --> 00:24:18,470
Speaker 1: what to do if you have already a frozen steak.

398
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,790
Speaker 1: And apparently, you do not let it thaw.

399
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,290
Speaker 1: You can cook it frozen, and it's better.

400
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:33,129
Speaker 1: Now, you have to freeze it in the correct way, which they also show you how to freeze it without it getting all frosty and shit.

401
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:36,910
Speaker 0: This is sounding pretty fascinating.

402
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,191
Speaker 0: But

403
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:53,789
Speaker 1: basically, the long and short of it is that when you cook it when it's already frozen, if you do it properly, the outside is going to heat up really fast and get cooked, and the inside is really cold, so as long as you cook it enough, and it does take longer to cook and more effort.

404
00:24:55,614 --> 00:25:16,108
Speaker 1: But because the inside was colder, basically, the non-pink area on the edge will be really thin, and the inside will be mad pink, whereas if you let it thaw, the gray area will be a couple of millimeters thick, and the pink area will be much smaller, and basically, all of their tasting...

405
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,209
Speaker 0: Do I need to cook it at a different temperature now?

406
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,850
Speaker 1: You have to follow the instructions in the video I'm linking you to.

407
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:22,146
Speaker 0: Okay.

408
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:23,306
Speaker 0: Okay.

409
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,990
Speaker 1: For both freezing and cooking.

410
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,390
Speaker 1: This is only if you have a frozen steak.

411
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,386
Speaker 1: If your steak is fresh...

412
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:32,590
Speaker 0: If you already found the war atrocity, and you're just trying to mitigate the damage.

413
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:37,709
Speaker 1: Or if you bought a whole ton of fucking steak, and you have to freeze some of it, right?

414
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,190
Speaker 1: Because you cannot cook it.

415
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,737
Speaker 1: You have too much.

416
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:40,489
Speaker 1: You can't cook it all.

417
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,129
Speaker 1: Fresh is still better.

418
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:43,365
Speaker 1: The end.

419
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,709
Speaker 0: I like how many times you had to qualify that.

420
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:52,650
Speaker 1: Because obviously, I don't want people coming up to me and being like, "No way frozen steak is better than fresh steak.

421
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,503
Speaker 1: I got to ward that

422
00:25:53,646 --> 00:25:53,727
Speaker 1: off.".

423
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,689
Speaker 1: Because you know someone's going to say that if I come and be like...

424
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, but blacked out of mine.

425
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,950
Speaker 0: I take quotes out of context in the community.

426
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,849
Speaker 1: You're overusing and sometimes really stretching your use of black dynamite.

427
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,069
Speaker 0: I like saying black... I just like saying black dynamite.

428
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,264
Speaker 1: You're supposed to say, "But black

429
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:09,770
Speaker 1: dynamite."

430
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:11,608
Speaker 1: I stretch and sometimes misuse.

431
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:17,630
Speaker 1: But black dynamite.

432
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:18,270
Speaker 0: Okay.

433
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,870
Speaker 0: So in about a moment, the Book Club book is a category for Leibovitz.

434
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,750
Speaker 0: Scott will probably read it when winter comes.

435
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,950
Speaker 0: So hang tight.

436
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,430
Speaker 1: It's coming.

437
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,410
Speaker 0: It's coming.

438
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,139
Speaker 0: Yeah.

439
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:29,829
Speaker 0: I've read a few more books since then.

440
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:30,303
Speaker 1: Okay.

441
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:32,090
Speaker 0: We are going to be at PAX Prime.

442
00:26:32,932 --> 00:26:37,685
Speaker 0: We are doing a lecture called "How to Win Every

443
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:38,389
Speaker 0: Game."

444
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,269
Speaker 0: Not just some games.

445
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,189
Speaker 1: Not just one game.

446
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:40,789
Speaker 1: Every game.

447
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,669
Speaker 0: It seems obvious that when playing a game of skill, one attempts to win.

448
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,588
Speaker 0: Interestingly, this is not often the case.

449
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,510
Speaker 1: Why are you reading the description from the PAX catalog?

450
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,970
Speaker 0: Even skilled gamers rarely analyze to any real depth the underlying mechanics of a given game, blah, blah, blah.

451
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,810
Speaker 0: We'll teach you specific examples like Stratego, Settlers of Catan, and even football.

452
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,250
Speaker 1: So not that you can change your mind about going to PAX at this point.

453
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,890
Speaker 1: At least 99.9% of people on Earth can't really suddenly decide to go now.

454
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,830
Speaker 1: Whoever's going is going.

455
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,110
Speaker 1: Whoever's not going is not going.

456
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:12,010
Speaker 1: But the guidebook came out, and the schedule is already up, but because the guidebook came out, I actually looked at the schedule.

457
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:13,027
Speaker 0: I was looking at it too.

458
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:14,469
Speaker 1: And I learned two things.

459
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:21,310
Speaker 1: Number one, the guy who created Final Fantasy is going to be there.

460
00:27:21,731 --> 00:27:25,030
Speaker 1: Not Nobu, who we've seen at every convention ever, who made the music.

461
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:27,310
Speaker 1: Not Amano, who made the art.

462
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:30,529
Speaker 1: The guy who made the game is going to be there.

463
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,448
Speaker 1: I never even thought of that.

464
00:27:33,032 --> 00:27:35,769
Speaker 1: It's like a guest I wanted to see, I didn't even know I wanted to see.

465
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:43,990
Speaker 1: Obviously, some of the big names that are always there are going to be there, like I think Inafune is going to be there again with his mighty numbers and whatever.

466
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:45,808
Speaker 1: I learned something else.

467
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:51,750
Speaker 1: The guy who made Tetris is going to be there.

468
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,690
Speaker 0: And somehow is not doing the keynote.

469
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:55,327
Speaker 1: Are you kidding me?

470
00:27:57,631 --> 00:28:00,649
Speaker 1: Someone I wanted to see, I didn't even know I wanted to see.

471
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,430
Speaker 1: And now I've got to wait up how long to go to that panel.

472
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,410
Speaker 1: And he also has an autograph thing that I'm not going to wait in line for.

473
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,250
Speaker 0: The thing is, ever since they stopped doing the Q&A...

474
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,510
Speaker 1: Should I go and buy on eBay a Game Boy Tetris really quick?

475
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:15,069
Speaker 1: I don't care about autographs, but just like, it's how you make Tetris.

476
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:16,688
Speaker 1: Are you kidding me?

477
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,770
Speaker 0: The third thing in my life that I regret is eating that food that gave me food poisoning.

478
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:31,710
Speaker 0: But the fourth thing is that we didn't get up a couple hours earlier so I could get my Zelda 2 signed by Miyamoto.

479
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,968
Speaker 1: I guess we could have done that.

480
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:34,778
Speaker 0: We could have.

481
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,630
Speaker 0: We should have.

482
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:42,070
Speaker 0: We chose not to, and we had to live with the decisions that we made because our lives are, in fact, the sum of the decisions we made.

483
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,569
Speaker 1: It just so happens, if you look at the PAX schedule this year, right?

484
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:48,430
Speaker 1: Let me just open my guidebook here for a second.

485
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,490
Speaker 0: I got my guidebook open.

486
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:50,629
Speaker 1: Hold on, let me open my guidebook.

487
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,370
Speaker 1: No, not MAGFest 12, PAX Prime 2014.

488
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,629
Speaker 1: Shows how many conventions I'm going to.

489
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:57,488
Speaker 1: My schedule.

490
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:01,010
Speaker 1: So, Friday, all I have in my schedule is a keynote.

491
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,230
Speaker 1: Saturday, there's a bunch of stuff I kind of want to do on Saturday.

492
00:29:06,531 --> 00:29:09,044
Speaker 1: There's a video game data panel, which I think is an update of that one.

493
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,250
Speaker 1: Alex went to that one time.

494
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,790
Speaker 1: And Alex Levitt has his Twitch Played Pokemon panel.

495
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,670
Speaker 1: And there's a Luke Crane panels twice on Saturday.

496
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:18,910
Speaker 1: But I'm probably going to spend all Saturday playing Netrunner.

497
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:25,030
Speaker 1: On Sunday, this Tetris panel, is it three on Saturday?

498
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,249
Speaker 0: I feel like we should go to that.

499
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Sunday.

500
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:29,170
Speaker 1: Is it three on Sunday?

501
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,350
Speaker 1: And the Pac-Man CEDX tournament is at seven on Sunday.

502
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:34,870
Speaker 0: Is that going to be your Sunday night?

503
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:40,587
Speaker 1: For once, the Pac-Man CEDX tournament does not conflict with anything else I could possibly want to do at PAX.

504
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,374
Speaker 1: This is the first time.

505
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:44,529
Speaker 1: They've had this tournament at every PAX I've been to.

506
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:47,926
Speaker 1: Maybe not Australia, but it is always conflicted with something.

507
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:48,810
Speaker 1: It does not conflict.

508
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,969
Speaker 1: I might have to go practice Pac-Man when I get home because I haven't played in months.

509
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,770
Speaker 1: And then, of course, our panel and Omegathon final on Monday.

510
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,708
Speaker 0: Monday, Sandworm Theater, noon.

511
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:00,734
Speaker 1: Noon.

512
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:01,769
Speaker 0: There you go.

513
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:02,331
Speaker 0: Yup.

514
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:05,310
Speaker 0: We'll try to do some video and cool other stuff from the convention.

515
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:12,270
Speaker 0: And if you're a Geek Nights fan and you want to hang out with us, we're going to basically do an official Geek Nights meetup.

516
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:16,350
Speaker 0: Come to our panel or hang around near it if you can't get in because it fills up.

517
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,670
Speaker 0: And after that, we can all sort of go into the Omegathon line together.

518
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:23,450
Speaker 1: Well, I was going to meet that guy for lunch after the panel.

519
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:24,889
Speaker 1: But we can do after that.

520
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:25,788
Speaker 0: Oh, which guy?

521
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:27,269
Speaker 1: The YouTube guy.

522
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:28,144
Speaker 0: Oh, that guy.

523
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:28,390
Speaker 0: Okay.

524
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, so our panel is going to go to one.

525
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:33,370
Speaker 1: Omegathon is at 5.30.

526
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:33,458
Speaker 0: Yeah.

527
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,569
Speaker 1: So we'll probably go eat lunch.

528
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:37,569
Speaker 0: So what I'm saying is...

529
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,270
Speaker 1: And then go to the Omegathon line and have a meetup.

530
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:47,469
Speaker 0: Meet us at or after the panel and we will provide the details of the actual, like, for real hangout Omegathon lineup.

531
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's still the best meetup location and time that we can give.

532
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:56,150
Speaker 1: That's a guarantee because we're going to be at the panel and we're going to be at the exit of the panel when it exits.

533
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:04,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you want to have an official meetup and hang out with cool Geek Nights listeners and fans and friends, that is the time to find us to figure out the rest of Monday at PAX.

534
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:05,310
Speaker 1: Yup.

535
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:07,895
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

536
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:08,599
Speaker 0: So we'll be there.

537
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,423
Speaker 0: I'll be at PAX Dev.

538
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:10,970
Speaker 0: If you're at PAX Dev, totally let me know.

539
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,190
Speaker 0: Maybe we can hang out and talk about it because we can't talk about it with anyone else.

540
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:28,170
Speaker 0: So we have been fans for a very long time of James Rolfe, also known as the Angry Nintendo Nerd, later renamed due to copyright issues, the Angry Video Game Nerd.

541
00:31:28,851 --> 00:31:33,310
Speaker 1: He is a person who is very similar to us in age and culture.

542
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,830
Speaker 0: Well, culture as it relates to console video games.

543
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:39,774
Speaker 1: Yes.

544
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:45,530
Speaker 1: And he enjoys many of the same works that we enjoy and he produces video content that we enjoy.

545
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,088
Speaker 1: And that's all there is to it.

546
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:48,910
Speaker 0: Yup.

547
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:55,790
Speaker 0: He's not like a lot of the other people on this level in the sense that he doesn't go to a lot of conventions when he does.

548
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,649
Speaker 0: He doesn't really do much or say much.

549
00:31:57,911 --> 00:31:59,294
Speaker 0: He's pretty narrowly focused.

550
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:04,990
Speaker 0: Not that often you see him, other than on YouTube, but he made a movie.

551
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:05,920
Speaker 1: He did.

552
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:10,450
Speaker 1: He made a movie about... And he actually finished the movie, made it, and put it in theaters for reals.

553
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,370
Speaker 0: Yes, and we went and saw it in a real theater in New York City.

554
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,850
Speaker 1: We had an opportunity to see it in New York City, just had to buy tickets, so I did.

555
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,910
Speaker 1: And it's going to be screened at PAX, by the way, but I don't have to waste my PAX time on that because I saw it already.

556
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:27,890
Speaker 0: I need at least one of you to go to the screening because at the end of this episode, I have a question for you.

557
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:29,898
Speaker 0: But the question is a spoiler.

558
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:32,430
Speaker 0: Not for the movie, but for something else.

559
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:32,847
Speaker 0: Okay.

560
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,532
Speaker 0: But, yeah.

561
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:38,441
Speaker 0: So, we're not going to spoil it because you should see it.

562
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:42,090
Speaker 0: If you're a fan of him at all, it's actually really worth watching.

563
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:42,911
Speaker 1: Right.

564
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:46,250
Speaker 1: I mean, this is not fucking Citizen Kane, obviously.

565
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,958
Speaker 1: But he knows how to make movies.

566
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:50,304
Speaker 1: That's his thing, right?

567
00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:51,730
Speaker 1: He's like his soul thing.

568
00:32:51,872 --> 00:32:52,770
Speaker 0: He's a movie nerd.

569
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,632
Speaker 1: He's a movie nerd.

570
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:56,199
Speaker 1: So, did he do a good job?

571
00:32:56,219 --> 00:32:56,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

572
00:32:56,961 --> 00:33:00,190
Speaker 1: I mean, it's pretty much exactly what I expected.

573
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:06,270
Speaker 1: It's like an Angry Video Game Nerd episode, only longer, only bigger production value.

574
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,634
Speaker 0: Surprisingly high quality.

575
00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:16,470
Speaker 0: Like, the production values in terms of just shooting and lighting and all the technical stuff, I was really, actually, seriously impressed.

576
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,030
Speaker 1: And it's almost two hours long, and it's not bad.

577
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:20,551
Speaker 0: Yeah.

578
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:22,395
Speaker 0: There's only a few things that drag.

579
00:33:22,415 --> 00:33:26,144
Speaker 0: Like, there's an on-running joke with one of the girls toward the end.

580
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:28,750
Speaker 0: that's just kind of a little overdone and a little bad.

581
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:37,510
Speaker 0: But at the same time, there's other jokes that took me by such surprise that I laughed out loud and almost hurt myself because I didn't expect the movie to be that good.

582
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:37,810
Speaker 0: Yeah.

583
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:40,157
Speaker 1: It is not without flaw, right?

584
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:44,310
Speaker 1: But it's the kind of movie where you're not going to be -- you will not regret going to see it.

585
00:33:44,951 --> 00:33:46,696
Speaker 1: It's going to be available digitally pretty soon.

586
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:49,746
Speaker 1: If you are a fan of Angry Video Game Nerd, you will want to see this.

587
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:50,950
Speaker 1: It's worth seeing.

588
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:59,570
Speaker 1: Some of the things that I think I didn't like were, like, they had this running joke where they would use -- like, they would explode a toy.

589
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,180
Speaker 1: Like, if a van was supposed to crash, they would have a toy van and crash it, and it would be shot in a way.

590
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,822
Speaker 1: that's obvious.

591
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:09,889
Speaker 1: it was a toy van and not the way Star Wars does it, where it's not obvious it's a toy.

592
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:11,810
Speaker 0: I liked that when it kept happening.

593
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,022
Speaker 1: Right, so it happened, like, once, and it's like, "Ah, I gotcha," right?

594
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,170
Speaker 1: But then it happened, like, a bunch more times.

595
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:26,030
Speaker 0: But every time it happened, because it was a different model, like, it got to the point where the colander and the missile thing, like, that was funny, even though it was the same gag again.

596
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,388
Speaker 0: It also -- I had a colander like that.

597
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:32,330
Speaker 1: The checkoff's gun was also really obvious, but that's okay.

598
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:32,846
Speaker 0: Yup.

599
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:37,389
Speaker 1: I still don't know -- even watching it, I don't know what the name of that big boss monster was.

600
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:39,101
Speaker 0: Something.

601
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:40,670
Speaker 0: Hell's garbage.

602
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:42,310
Speaker 1: I can't even remember.

603
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:42,652
Speaker 0: My brain can't.

604
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:44,250
Speaker 0: My brain just thinks of it as word mash.

605
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:46,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing, the bad guy thing.

606
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,770
Speaker 0: I like that bad guy thing, though.

607
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:48,070
Speaker 0: Right.

608
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:55,942
Speaker 1: But actually, I think, you know, it was funny, because everyone knows, if you know anything about it, right, the whole point of this movie is that he's going to review

609
00:34:56,022 --> 00:34:56,443
Speaker 1: E.T.,

610
00:34:56,763 --> 00:35:02,690
Speaker 1: which is the game he was never going to -- it's the unspeakable E.T So, you know, he saved it for the movie.

611
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:09,530
Speaker 0: But his moral was literally identical to what we have been saying in our bad games lecture for a couple years.

612
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, everything we have been saying about E.T.

613
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:13,718
Speaker 1: for all this time is exactly what he said about

614
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:14,179
Speaker 1: E.T.,

615
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,930
Speaker 1: which is really interesting, because it's only sometimes that we say the exact same thing he says.

616
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:20,430
Speaker 0: Yeah.

617
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,650
Speaker 0: So, like, I was really surprised that that was the moral, that the game wasn't actually that bad, guys.

618
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:26,269
Speaker 0: Seriously.

619
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,993
Speaker 1: But, like, the movie has -- It's like GameStop culture.

620
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:36,179
Speaker 1: It comments on, like, video game history.

621
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:40,110
Speaker 1: It comments on -- like, he comments on his own fans and, like, you know, their culture.

622
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,877
Speaker 1: It's like this movie, like, even though you could say the whole thing is a review of

623
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:45,418
Speaker 1: E.T.,

624
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:53,710
Speaker 1: it actually touches on, like, so many different things without, like, fucking up the pacing or anything like that or feeling, you know, too disjointed.

625
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,629
Speaker 1: It's also -- I don't think a lot of people -- Like, he manages to fit everything in very nicely.

626
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:58,031
Speaker 0: Yeah.

627
00:35:58,071 --> 00:36:01,225
Speaker 0: Like, it could have been cut a little bit shorter, I think, but not that much.

628
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:02,390
Speaker 0: Like, the editing was not bad.

629
00:36:03,071 --> 00:36:12,590
Speaker 0: And there were a surprising number of very apt and very subtle film references that I don't think most of the people in the audience got.

630
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,850
Speaker 1: Well, I think -- That's Terminator 2.

631
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,755
Speaker 0: That's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3.

632
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:17,329
Speaker 0: That's Vertigo.

633
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:24,370
Speaker 1: Well, there are certain things that, you know, if you're just watching this and you don't know tons about film, you're going to miss.

634
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:37,605
Speaker 1: But if you watch the videos on his site that are not Angry Video Game Nerd videos, if you're, like, a Cinemassacre fan and you've watched all of his content, all the Monster Madness and all his other stuff, then you're actually going to get a lot of that stuff.

635
00:36:37,685 --> 00:36:42,150
Speaker 1: if you're observant, you know, because he's taught it to you in the past already.

636
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:45,709
Speaker 1: So even if you're not a movie fan -- If you're a fan of him.

637
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,437
Speaker 1: If you're a fan of him, he's sort of bled his enough movie fandom onto you.

638
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:56,410
Speaker 1: There were quite a few things I noticed that I would not have noticed just based on my movie knowledge, but I noticed because I had watched a video that he did.

639
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,970
Speaker 0: Specifically the reference to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3.

640
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,070
Speaker 0: Yeah.

641
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,277
Speaker 0: That was really good when that happened.

642
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:05,829
Speaker 0: You'll know it when you see it, at least I hope you do.

643
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:13,250
Speaker 0: The critical response was kind of eh, but I don't really expect -- I wonder how this movie goes over with someone who knows nothing about him at all.

644
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:14,011
Speaker 0: Huh.

645
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:24,969
Speaker 0: Hollywood Reporter called it, quote, "an overly long and obsessively self-indulgent work with production value that hovers above home video quality by a few admirable

646
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:25,490
Speaker 0: notches.".

647
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,657
Speaker 1: So I do agree that it was -- there was a lot of self-indulgence.

648
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:36,730
Speaker 1: There were tons of stuff in there that was basically -- it wasn't self-indulgent as much as it was audience-pandering woo games.

649
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:37,329
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

650
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:38,629
Speaker 0: Which bothers me a lot.

651
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,270
Speaker 1: There was a section -- It bothers me a lot anywhere it appears, not just movies.

652
00:37:42,531 --> 00:37:50,530
Speaker 0: This is where we got to talk a little bit about the experience of being in this theater, because that -- I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more had I watched it alone at home.

653
00:37:51,154 --> 00:37:51,829
Speaker 0: Or with friends.

654
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,051
Speaker 0: Yeah.

655
00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:53,553
Speaker 0: Well, me.

656
00:37:53,654 --> 00:37:54,578
Speaker 0: Maybe not you as much.

657
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:57,210
Speaker 0: I was in a particularly difficult situation.

658
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,572
Speaker 0: I will get to --.

659
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:10,110
Speaker 0: so, whenever there was a joke that was obvious, like, people were not reacting heavily to most of the, like, more nuanced references.

660
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:15,562
Speaker 0: But when, like, some -- the equivalent of someone getting hit in the nuts happens, the entire crowd would go,

661
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:15,963
Speaker 0: "Ha!"

662
00:38:16,684 --> 00:38:19,390
Speaker 0: Like, one loud "ha" as loud as they could, and then clap and hoot.

663
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:26,050
Speaker 1: Also, when there was lots and lots of cameos from other Internet videos, celebrity-type people.

664
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:27,477
Speaker 0: And they were pretty well done.

665
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:30,090
Speaker 0: Like, they were integrated, I think, the best way you could do that thing.

666
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,910
Speaker 1: Sort of, but it's, like, you'd see, like, Doug Walker was on screen for, like, five seconds.

667
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:36,918
Speaker 0: Oh, my -- so -- And the whole place exploded.

668
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:40,210
Speaker 1: Just -- you didn't even -- it's, like, what he was doing wasn't even funny.

669
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,444
Speaker 0: His bit was, like, 12 seconds long.

670
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:48,830
Speaker 1: Just because he was on screen and he was Doug Walker, everyone in the place is, like, exploding, like, cheering and hollering and hooting.

671
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,053
Speaker 0: Hollering and hooting.

672
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:51,718
Speaker 0: The guy next to me just screeched.

673
00:38:51,939 --> 00:38:52,902
Speaker 0: He just went, "Ah!

674
00:38:53,404 --> 00:38:53,524
Speaker 0: Ah!

675
00:38:54,086 --> 00:38:54,226
Speaker 0: Ah!".

676
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:55,350
Speaker 0: I'm not even joking.

677
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,685
Speaker 0: And then, like, that cameo was maybe 12 seconds long.

678
00:38:58,725 --> 00:38:59,830
Speaker 0: The crowd goes apeshit.

679
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:09,190
Speaker 0: They stand up and then give, like, a standing ovation to the point that you couldn't hear the dialogue of most of the next cameo.

680
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:11,509
Speaker 0: Like, what the fuck, you kids?

681
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:18,089
Speaker 0: They did the same thing for most of -- like, Keith Apicary had a cameo, and it was the same thing.

682
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:23,430
Speaker 1: And just throughout the entire movie -- His cameo was actually probably one of the better ones.

683
00:39:23,512 --> 00:39:23,825
Speaker 1: It was.

684
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:29,230
Speaker 1: He just electrocuted himself, and it was satisfying to see him get harmed, even if it was fake harm.

685
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,330
Speaker 1: He was almost Ernest-esque in his cameo.

686
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,290
Speaker 0: So, this sold out, obviously.

687
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,750
Speaker 0: And we met some friends, and we went over to this thing, and, you know, the movie was at, what, like, 7?

688
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,924
Speaker 0: So, you guys got there, what, like, 45 minutes early?

689
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,837
Speaker 1: Something like that, yeah.

690
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:47,230
Speaker 1: I went to the Duane Reade, got a water.

691
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:55,550
Speaker 0: It is obvious that at least the first 100 or so, maybe 200 people in line had been there for four-plus hours.

692
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I noticed -- like, I saw how many people were in line in front of us, which is maybe 100 at most.

693
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:05,842
Speaker 1: And I checked the capacity of the place on the Internet, and I was like, "Oh, we're good.

694
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,489
Speaker 1: We can go even farther back in line.

695
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:08,730
Speaker 1: We'll be

696
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:08,850
Speaker 1: fine.".

697
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,414
Speaker 0: But, like, it was a sold-out show.

698
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:16,050
Speaker 0: Everyone had guaranteed tickets, and yet these people had been lined up, possibly all day, I get the impression.

699
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,281
Speaker 1: Well, there was actually -- we were at the second showing.

700
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:20,190
Speaker 1: Well, we were at the first showing that was offered.

701
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,598
Speaker 1: They added a second showing, and the first one sold out.

702
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:25,690
Speaker 1: That actually aired -- was before the one we saw.

703
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:31,630
Speaker 1: So, like, people had gone in, and other people were waiting outside while there were other people inside were watching.

704
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,448
Speaker 1: Those people left, and then we went in.

705
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:39,468
Speaker 0: Also, I ended up having an extra ticket, and what was interesting is that I tweeted, like, "Hey, I got this extra

706
00:40:39,508 --> 00:40:39,749
Speaker 0: ticket.".

707
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:44,081
Speaker 0: The people who responded to that were frightening.

708
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:47,350
Speaker 0: They really fucking wanted that ticket.

709
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:54,649
Speaker 0: But, luckily, one guy who seemed pretty cool was -- and he had Simon Belmont from Captain N. Avatar -- There you go.

710
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,840
Speaker 0: -- was like, "Hey, can I have

711
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:55,900
Speaker 0: it?".

712
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,324
Speaker 0: And I was like,

713
00:40:56,344 --> 00:40:56,505
Speaker 0: "Yeah.".

714
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,955
Speaker 0: But then he didn't show up in time.

715
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:00,941
Speaker 0: I told him to be there by 6.40.

716
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:01,462
Speaker 0: He wasn't.

717
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,505
Speaker 0: They let the line in.

718
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,110
Speaker 0: I didn't see his Chimchar.

719
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,856
Speaker 0: That's how he told me I'd find him.

720
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:07,444
Speaker 0: He was like, "Yo, I'll have a Chimchar,".

721
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:08,730
Speaker 0: and they sent me a link to a Chimchar.

722
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:10,050
Speaker 0: Like, dude, I know what a Chimchar is.

723
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,069
Speaker 1: You know what a Chimchar is.

724
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,570
Speaker 0: Luckily, I don't feel too bad because -- It's a fire monkey.

725
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,918
Speaker 0: After the movie, I saw on Twitter, he tweeted at me.

726
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:16,782
Speaker 0: He's like, "Hey, I got in.

727
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:16,922
Speaker 0: No

728
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:17,344
Speaker 0: worries.".

729
00:41:17,404 --> 00:41:18,910
Speaker 0: So, at least he got to see it.

730
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:19,508
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

731
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,752
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that worked.

732
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:31,750
Speaker 0: But the people in the line, mostly, like, the vast majority were, like, 14 to 19-year-old fat white guys.

733
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:32,372
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

734
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,363
Speaker 1: I saw e-cigs.

735
00:41:34,846 --> 00:41:35,630
Speaker 1: I saw fedoras.

736
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,213
Speaker 0: Trilbys.

737
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:47,170
Speaker 0: The Trilby e-cig pony shirts or AVGN shirt, you know, the equivalent of the guy wearing the T-shirt of the band at the concert that they're going to right now.

738
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,187
Speaker 1: Yeah, AVGN cosplays were not numbered in the zeroes.

739
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:59,610
Speaker 0: And I was walking up and down the line looking for Chimchar guy, and I started overhearing conversations with the people in line in front of us, the people who'd been there for a while.

740
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:03,586
Speaker 0: Those conversations -- there's only one word I can use to describe those conversations.

741
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:04,208
Speaker 0: That word is

742
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:04,650
Speaker 0: "choice.".

743
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:13,170
Speaker 0: There were these two guys who were talking about a video game, and I think they were talking about the Stanley Parable.

744
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:18,306
Speaker 0: But neither one of them knew what the name of it was, and the one guy was explaining what the game is like.

745
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:19,349
Speaker 0: he was an authority on it.

746
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:24,129
Speaker 0: But he was making shit up, and obviously had never actually played it.

747
00:42:24,551 --> 00:42:28,350
Speaker 0: And I hung around next to these guys just kind of listening to see where this conversation was going.

748
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,229
Speaker 1: This is like elementary school when there was no internet and you could just make shit up.

749
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like that's what was going on in this line in front of us.

750
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:40,130
Speaker 0: And then I walked to the back of the line, and yeah, that was a gigantic line wrapping around the block.

751
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:47,590
Speaker 0: There were dudes walking up and down the line, like one guy had a petition to get them to review some game.

752
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:50,900
Speaker 0: And then we go in.

753
00:42:51,323 --> 00:42:52,170
Speaker 0: We go in to see the movie.

754
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,760
Speaker 1: I think he wanted them to play Earthrealm Jim 3D.

755
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:57,090
Speaker 1: That was the game he wanted reviewed.

756
00:42:57,391 --> 00:42:58,577
Speaker 0: I like his reaction on stage.

757
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,622
Speaker 0: He was like, "Uh,

758
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:00,869
Speaker 0: okay.".

759
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:07,870
Speaker 0: So they let the line in, and the people in the front just basically fucking run to sit in the front center.

760
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:12,050
Speaker 0: So we just walk in casually, and we go in and we see there's a bunch of seats.

761
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:15,530
Speaker 0: So we kind of go around to the far right side instead of coming down the left side.

762
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,929
Speaker 1: We just sat down in pretty good seats.

763
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,072
Speaker 0: Yep.

764
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:19,817
Speaker 0: We start going in toward the center.

765
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,843
Speaker 0: I held up our group before.

766
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:24,250
Speaker 0: Two seats before the next person.

767
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:26,058
Speaker 1: Well, you want to leave a two-seat gap.

768
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,530
Speaker 1: Leaving a one-seat gap is jerky because it's a sold-out show.

769
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,089
Speaker 1: Someone's going to be all alone there.

770
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,950
Speaker 1: You leave a two-seat gap so a group of two can come in and fit in that slot.

771
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:43,490
Speaker 0: However, my real rationale was due to the size and enthusiasm of the gentleman who was sitting there, really wanted to be two seats away.

772
00:43:44,591 --> 00:43:55,888
Speaker 0: So we're sitting there fine, and then this other group of people who were slow-moving but had been pretty far ahead of us in line come around, and they asked the end of our group, "Hey, we're a group of four,".

773
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,389
Speaker 0: because there were two empty seats on either side of our group.

774
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:01,146
Speaker 0: And they were like, "Can you guys scoot over so we can fit our group of four

775
00:44:01,227 --> 00:44:01,267
Speaker 0: in?".

776
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:03,382
Speaker 0: And Scott and everyone's like, "All right.

777
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:03,926
Speaker 0: Whatever.

778
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:04,167
Speaker 0: Cool.".

779
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:06,301
Speaker 0: I'm looking at everyone like, "Please no.

780
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:07,066
Speaker 0: Please

781
00:44:07,086 --> 00:44:07,408
Speaker 0: no.".

782
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:09,290
Speaker 0: But I'm not going to be that asshole.

783
00:44:09,852 --> 00:44:11,690
Speaker 0: So we start to scoot over toward the middle.

784
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,640
Speaker 0: Then the guy's like, "Oh, no.

785
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,246
Speaker 0: We wanted you to scoot toward the end.

786
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:17,009
Speaker 0: We want to sit in the

787
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:17,230
Speaker 0: middle.".

788
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:18,584
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Go fuck

789
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:18,969
Speaker 1: yourself.".

790
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:20,519
Speaker 0: What did you say exactly?

791
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:21,224
Speaker 0: You said, "What?

792
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:22,109
Speaker 0: No.".

793
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:23,769
Speaker 0: And then we just sat back down.

794
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:24,727
Speaker 1: What's wrong with you?

795
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:32,197
Speaker 0: So for the next 20 minutes, this group of people, that guy keeps talking loudly to his friends like, "We saw those seats first.

796
00:44:32,238 --> 00:44:33,081
Speaker 0: They weren't using them.

797
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:34,768
Speaker 0: We got here in line before

798
00:44:34,808 --> 00:44:34,969
Speaker 0: them.".

799
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:38,710
Speaker 0: And I think he was mad and stewing about that for the entire movie.

800
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:48,394
Speaker 1: I should just go to the Major League Baseball Stadium, and I'll buy nosebleed seats, and then I'll just go down to the behind-the-home plate and be like, "Okay.

801
00:44:48,876 --> 00:44:51,888
Speaker 1: Can you guys move up to the upper deck so I can have these

802
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:52,190
Speaker 1: seats?".

803
00:44:53,111 --> 00:44:53,395
Speaker 1: "Cool.

804
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:54,043
Speaker 0: Thanks, bro.

805
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:54,549
Speaker 0: Yeah.".

806
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:54,844
Speaker 0: Yup.

807
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,747
Speaker 1: They'll be like, "Usher, how did this guy get

808
00:44:58,767 --> 00:44:58,888
Speaker 1: here?".

809
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:08,130
Speaker 0: So the guy next to me was oozed into my seat to the point that he was bodily leaning on me the entire time, and I kept sliding closer and closer to Scott, but I couldn't get away from him because the more--

810
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,446
Speaker 1: And you kept elbowing my arm off the

811
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:09,750
Speaker 0: armrest.

812
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the more I moved away from him, the more he came into my seat.

813
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:19,349
Speaker 0: And I thought maybe the passive-regressive model of not moving and letting him feel like, "Oh, I bumped into someone,".

814
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:24,349
Speaker 0: either he did not feel me or he gave no shits because he just oozed over me.

815
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:26,575
Speaker 1: The blob.

816
00:45:26,716 --> 00:45:27,946
Speaker 1: People are fans of James Rolfe.

817
00:45:27,966 --> 00:45:28,510
Speaker 1: We like the blob.

818
00:45:29,152 --> 00:45:38,849
Speaker 0: And I feel bad kind of calling this guy out, but every time something funny happened in the movie, he'd pump his arm and scream and kick me.

819
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:49,150
Speaker 1: Right, so we are not, me even less so than others, are not outwardly enthusiastic about things.

820
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,977
Speaker 1: We will clap politely.

821
00:45:50,997 --> 00:45:53,027
Speaker 1: We rarely cheer and scream and get crazy.

822
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,688
Speaker 0: And even when I cheer, there are things that weren't--.

823
00:45:56,111 --> 00:45:59,446
Speaker 0: For example, at a hockey game, I will jump up out of my seat and go, "Fuck

824
00:45:59,487 --> 00:45:59,908
Speaker 0: yes!".

825
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:00,337
Speaker 1: Yeah.

826
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,107
Speaker 1: But I won't do that-- It can happen.

827
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:08,270
Speaker 0: I won't do that every time a minor joke happens in a two-hour movie.

828
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:08,808
Speaker 1: Yes.

829
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:10,730
Speaker 0: Every single time.

830
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:20,850
Speaker 1: But this entire crowd, other than a few people, us included, was-- When James Rolfe came out at the end-- Basically, they celebrated like their team won the World Cup.

831
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,429
Speaker 0: With every dick joke.

832
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,348
Speaker 1: At every single thing.

833
00:46:25,513 --> 00:46:30,890
Speaker 0: And there was a point at the end where-- Every reference, every day, every everything.

834
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,464
Speaker 1: All you had to do was stay up there and basically go like,

835
00:46:34,149 --> 00:46:34,289
Speaker 1: "Ass!"

836
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,360
Speaker 1: And people would have gone like,

837
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:35,623
Speaker 1: "Whoo!".

838
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:39,658
Speaker 0: That actually pretty much directly happened during the Q&A, because James Rolfe was there.

839
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:40,649
Speaker 0: They did a Q&A at the end.

840
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:54,910
Speaker 0: And other than the fact that I missed a lot of dialogue from the movie because of the people screaming at every little joke, but the Q&A, when he came out on stage, the entire crowd stood up, and that was when we realized that to this crowd, he is their Jesus.

841
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:55,790
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

842
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,576
Speaker 0: And we looked around.

843
00:46:57,637 --> 00:46:59,025
Speaker 0: First, we all look at each other like,

844
00:46:59,206 --> 00:46:59,488
Speaker 0: "What?"

845
00:47:00,011 --> 00:47:05,990
Speaker 0: And then we look out in the crowd, and there are about 10 or 11 other people who we all kind of met eyes, sitting down.

846
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:06,637
Speaker 1: We're all sitting.

847
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,730
Speaker 1: We're the only people sitting.

848
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,819
Speaker 0: And we all look at each other like,

849
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:09,445
Speaker 0: "Wow.".

850
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:17,490
Speaker 0: And what followed was one of the saddest and most uncomfortable Q&A sessions I have ever witnessed.

851
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:24,385
Speaker 1: Well, we counted who broke Scott's rules with Q&A, and to be fair, people asked legit questions that were interesting.

852
00:47:24,486 --> 00:47:25,070
Speaker 1: There were a few.

853
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:27,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, not the first several, though.

854
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:33,390
Speaker 1: There were definitely questions that did not break the rules and were good questions, and I was actually interested to hear the answers, and they were good answers.

855
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:39,847
Speaker 1: But for the first thing, we had a streak going of not -- everyone was breaking the rules of Scott's Q&A.

856
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:42,826
Speaker 0: One guy right away was like, "Can I get your autograph right

857
00:47:42,887 --> 00:47:43,108
Speaker 0: now?".

858
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:47,441
Speaker 0: One guy was like, "I have a petition I want to deliver to you, blah, blah, blah, about the earthworms

859
00:47:47,482 --> 00:47:47,746
Speaker 0: thing.".

860
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:55,767
Speaker 0: And even then, I love these guys, but they don't really know how to work a crowd, so they didn't really repeat the questions.

861
00:47:55,788 --> 00:47:56,010
Speaker 0: very well.

862
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,740
Speaker 1: No, they make movies.

863
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,610
Speaker 1: They don't have stage skills.

864
00:47:59,971 --> 00:48:01,150
Speaker 1: When have they ever appeared on a stage?

865
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,687
Speaker 0: The way it went was eventually you'd just hear "mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble,

866
00:48:03,707 --> 00:48:03,949
Speaker 0: mumble.".

867
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:07,010
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, that was in fact a reference.

868
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,250
Speaker 0: You'd hear "mumble, mumble" and then an answer to a question you didn't hear.

869
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:18,589
Speaker 0: And the crowd would react to pretty much everything you said, and we realized after a while that this was going to go on for another hour.

870
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:20,889
Speaker 1: I was going to go on until they stopped it.

871
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was going to go for a while.

872
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,270
Speaker 1: And there was really no value to be had from staying there.

873
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of the questions could have been answered by Google.

874
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:29,449
Speaker 1: Yes.

875
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,424
Speaker 0: So we look at each other and we're like, "Bail?

876
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:31,889
Speaker 0: Bail.".

877
00:48:32,131 --> 00:48:33,309
Speaker 0: So we get up and we go to leave.

878
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:36,830
Speaker 0: We could not go to the left because of the excitable gentleman.

879
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,570
Speaker 1: And it was farther to go to the left anyway.

880
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:46,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we turn to the right to leave, and the guy, that group, the people that were mad at us, that guy looks at us and he's like, "What?

881
00:48:46,681 --> 00:48:47,766
Speaker 0: What do you mean you want to leave?

882
00:48:47,826 --> 00:48:48,147
Speaker 0: It's not

883
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:48,449
Speaker 0: over.".

884
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:59,370
Speaker 0: He was so visibly and viscerally offended that we were going to leave during the Q&A that they refused to get out of our way.

885
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,248
Speaker 0: They refused to move.

886
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,423
Speaker 0: He literally, they're like, "Well,

887
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:02,908
Speaker 0: bleh.".

888
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:09,030
Speaker 0: And they sat there, stopped looking at us, they faced forward, planted their feet, and refused to move their entire party.

889
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:11,669
Speaker 0: So we just stepped over them and left.

890
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,350
Speaker 0: It was amazing.

891
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:17,310
Speaker 0: I've never seen, I've never experienced something like that before.

892
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,304
Speaker 0: What's your life like that?

893
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:20,989
Speaker 0: this is what you do?

894
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:24,090
Speaker 1: Rewatching AVGN episodes every ten times a day?

895
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:35,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh, and during the Q&A, I think the most interesting part was that they didn't really have a process for it, so people would just raise their hands.

896
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:40,530
Speaker 0: I would say 80% of the crowd was Milhousing it the entire time.

897
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,730
Speaker 0: Like jumping up and down, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

898
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:51,469
Speaker 0: The excitable gentleman next to me, large excitable, maximal in both those areas, elbowed me in the head like nine times.

899
00:49:52,813 --> 00:49:54,330
Speaker 0: He just kept waving his arm around.

900
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:57,070
Speaker 0: Eventually, I just started ducking under him every time.

901
00:49:57,534 --> 00:49:58,830
Speaker 0: It was time to ask more questions.

902
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,290
Speaker 0: And then there was a moment where there's too many sad stories.

903
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,547
Speaker 0: I just won't even tell the rest of them.

904
00:50:04,892 --> 00:50:06,289
Speaker 0: You can imagine what this was like.

905
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:11,490
Speaker 0: So my task to you, tell us if it's like that at the PAX screening or not.

906
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:12,569
Speaker 1: Tell us if it's like that.

907
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,709
Speaker 1: If you went to any of the other screenings in any of the other states, tell us how it was like.

908
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:21,030
Speaker 1: And also, you know, this movie is going to come out digitally.

909
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:23,070
Speaker 1: It's worth watching.

910
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,490
Speaker 0: It is absolutely worth watching.

911
00:50:25,753 --> 00:50:27,369
Speaker 1: I'll watch it once again even.

912
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:28,690
Speaker 0: There's a joke in the beginning.

913
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:33,830
Speaker 1: I'll watch it once again with people who haven't seen it and it will be a worthwhile expenditure of two hours.

914
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:45,729
Speaker 1: Whoever it was who played the manager of that GameStop, it looks like it's going to be a-- That's one of those pot of gold, guy who can't get work, amazing actors who does one thing that they found in Hollywood when they were there.

915
00:50:45,852 --> 00:50:46,288
Speaker 0: That guy.

916
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:47,107
Speaker 0: Doing casting.

917
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:52,550
Speaker 0: Like he was average funny and then he took it up to maximum.

918
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:56,749
Speaker 1: I think if you go in Hollywood, there's all these desperate actors everywhere working nothing, right?

919
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:02,010
Speaker 1: But a lot of them have some kind of talent that just isn't like a movie for them or, you know, whatever.

920
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:04,550
Speaker 1: But if you go there, you can find these people.

921
00:51:04,952 --> 00:51:07,649
Speaker 1: And it's like I kind of just wish I had enough money to go there.

922
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:08,690
Speaker 0: Get all those people.

923
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:14,189
Speaker 1: Maybe not even make a movie, but just make something with a bunch of those people like that all together, right?

924
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:21,690
Speaker 1: Like those talented-- Because people have like a hidden amazing talent at like a certain kind of character or something, you know, where like their performance really stands out.

925
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,070
Speaker 1: The one I always think of, right, is when I went to see Les Mis.

926
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:28,950
Speaker 1: like in the '90s, the master of the house is just like this incredible dude.

927
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:29,390
Speaker 1: Yep.

928
00:51:30,112 --> 00:51:33,530
Speaker 1: Was it like an all-time fucking greatest actor or anything?

929
00:51:34,095 --> 00:51:34,669
Speaker 1: Probably not.

930
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:42,290
Speaker 1: But it's like dude got more applause than anyone else at the end because he was just so good at that thing right there, being that person.

931
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:46,150
Speaker 0: If you're the right kind of person, that's not a role.

932
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,569
Speaker 0: There are just people who are kind of like that.

933
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,890
Speaker 1: Right, obviously the role does part of the work as well, right?

934
00:51:50,771 --> 00:51:52,930
Speaker 1: You know, you need to get both things combined.

935
00:51:53,390 --> 00:52:06,730
Speaker 1: Like imagine if you went to see a show of some kind, play TV show, movie, whatever, and everyone in the whole thing was fucking like that ace character, you know, all across the board, you know?

936
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:13,950
Speaker 1: And even in things like, you know, Fullmetal Alchemist, like the Hughes character, it's just like the guy who's the best.

937
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:14,530
Speaker 1: Yeah.

938
00:52:15,652 --> 00:52:18,210
Speaker 0: So in the end, this movie definitely worth seeing.

939
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:21,470
Speaker 0: I went into it with what I thought were like reasonable expectations.

940
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:25,949
Speaker 0: This movie actually far exceeded them and was like really worth watching.

941
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,510
Speaker 1: I think it just matched my expectation precisely.

942
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,741
Speaker 0: I expected less and I got more.

943
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:32,230
Speaker 0: I'm actually really happy about that.

944
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,585
Speaker 1: Wow, you expected less than me.

945
00:52:33,605 --> 00:52:33,990
Speaker 1: That's rare.

946
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:35,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is rare.

947
00:52:35,058 --> 00:52:36,010
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

948
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:39,009
Speaker 0: Maybe just I've been jaded recently by stuff.

949
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:42,549
Speaker 0: Apparently used a Panasonic AGAF100 camera for a lot of this.

950
00:52:44,993 --> 00:52:47,070
Speaker 0: Wikipedia has a lot of info on the movie already.

951
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,669
Speaker 1: That was the camera they were using on the stage.

952
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,269
Speaker 0: And also has a notability warning on it.

953
00:52:52,816 --> 00:52:53,670
Speaker 1: I think it's notable.

954
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:56,570
Speaker 0: Nope, this article relies on all primary sources.

955
00:52:57,172 --> 00:53:01,750
Speaker 0: There are no references yet except James Rolfe himself about this movie.

956
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:02,390
Speaker 0: That's why.

957
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,170
Speaker 1: Let's do Wikipedia policy.

958
00:53:05,872 --> 00:53:06,943
Speaker 1: Someone's reviewed the movie.

959
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:07,650
Speaker 1: That's got to be enough.

960
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:09,047
Speaker 1: IMDb page, come on.

961
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:14,610
Speaker 0: Seriously, according to Wikipedia, the budget was around three or four hundred thousand dollars.

962
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:15,181
Speaker 1: Yeah.

963
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:24,446
Speaker 0: That, if this is the kind of movie that four hundred grand makes, we are in for a like platinum age of cinema in about ten years.

964
00:53:24,466 --> 00:53:25,149
Speaker 0: Seriously.

965
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:30,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, because in ten years you could take three or four hundred grand and make something even better than this.

966
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,390
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

967
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:43,530
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

Speaker 0: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
