1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,668
Speaker 1: It's Monday April 21st.

2
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:12,490
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:15,260
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,940
Speaker 1: We talk a bit about the fears and misconceptions surrounding RFID and privacy.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,931
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:36,080
Speaker 1: I know we've been saying this sort of thing a lot lately But I got to say once again welcome to all the new listeners.

7
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,266
Speaker 0: Hopefully there are some.

8
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:40,235
Speaker 1: I can already see a couple.

9
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:41,280
Speaker 1: someone was in the forum.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,235
Speaker 1: We got some emails and someone already sent me a picture They'd taken.

11
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:51,300
Speaker 1: but Yeah, for those of you who are at the event at Kinokuniya by Bryant Park on Sunday We were there with a TM revolution.

12
00:00:51,423 --> 00:00:52,139
Speaker 1: We did something fun.

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:01:03,429
Speaker 1: But we're actually not going to talk about that until Wednesday because geek nights is actually four nights a week and you know Mondays are science and tech and Tuesdays are gaming and Wednesdays are the anime manga comic show that you're interested in.

14
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,373
Speaker 0: yep, so today.

15
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:08,827
Speaker 0: We're just gonna talk about computers and shit You're probably not interested in.

16
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:11,000
Speaker 1: yeah, but if you're a geek you might have some overlap.

17
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:14,415
Speaker 1: I know a lot of people in that line waiting to see TMR.

18
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:16,423
Speaker 1: I saw some DS's Action in there.

19
00:01:16,503 --> 00:01:22,740
Speaker 0: It still shocks and amazes me like like how many people are like geeks like they are geeky peoples.

20
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:24,850
Speaker 0: They're in the same culture as us yet.

21
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,040
Speaker 0: They do not have the technology knowledges.

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,591
Speaker 0: It's like I feel well because well hand in hand, but I would they.

23
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:33,220
Speaker 1: why would someone be an anime geek and be a computer?

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,873
Speaker 1: I am yeah, but that doesn't mean everyone else is.

25
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:37,160
Speaker 0: I know it's like it goes one.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,834
Speaker 0: It feels like it's one direction, but not the other.

27
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:43,828
Speaker 0: like if someone's a computer geek They probably seen and enjoyed some animes.

28
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,920
Speaker 1: how many people on slash job complain about how much they hate anime all the time?

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,004
Speaker 1: There's a lot of them.

30
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:50,169
Speaker 0: I know, but it's it.

31
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:50,831
Speaker 0: They've seen it.

32
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:51,413
Speaker 0: They know of it.

33
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:53,140
Speaker 1: You know yeah, they know about it.

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,747
Speaker 1: They don't like it.

35
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:54,819
Speaker 1: They don't care about it.

36
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,547
Speaker 1: They know that it exists, and that's it.

37
00:01:56,627 --> 00:02:00,422
Speaker 1: much like someone might know that computer technology exists But they don't care.

38
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:01,085
Speaker 0: they gotta.

39
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:02,710
Speaker 0: you gotta cross it over people.

40
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,540
Speaker 0: you can't be just like doing one part not the other.

41
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:07,319
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah.

42
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,732
Speaker 1: Anyway before this event.

43
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:25,440
Speaker 1: This is somewhat more relevant to Monday We were hanging out in Brian Park since we Despite being press at the New York Comic Con we avoided most of our Presley duties because there wasn't that much of interest to cover And the only people I wanted interviews with declined interviews with anyone.

44
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:27,759
Speaker 1: So that was the end of that.

45
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:31,894
Speaker 1: But we left and we're waiting by Brian Park before our call up to go.

46
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:32,978
Speaker 1: do the TMR thing.

47
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:37,705
Speaker 1: in Kinokuniya We see some punk kids who were obviously Anonymous.

48
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:42,366
Speaker 0: yeah, it was pretty much like oh, hey There's anonymous people who happen to be here like.

49
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:46,280
Speaker 0: I recognize some of them from pictures on the internet like I've seen you before.

50
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:51,013
Speaker 1: Also, they had a little sign that pretty much said we're anonymous and they had their cards.

51
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:52,076
Speaker 1: and who else?

52
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:53,260
Speaker 0: where else would you see?

53
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:05,080
Speaker 0: Multiple v-masks a laughing man hat and other such things all on Young punk kids together in a group in the city, so I'm still dressed like press and I'm ready for this TMR event.

54
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,920
Speaker 1: So as a result, I'm dressed up really nice, and I look like a businessman.

55
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:22,351
Speaker 1: I got my little thing and I walk over and like excuse me and they all shut up and they stared me with this dubious look of what's this guy want a Scientologist oh, man, and I was like I'm a member of the press.

56
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:26,484
Speaker 1: and then there's this double look of oh oh oh oh It's like.

57
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:33,894
Speaker 1: and then I stopped and I realized they're all kind of afraid like wait right now I'm cool with you guys, and then they get they raise the eyebrow like no seriously.

58
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:35,780
Speaker 1: I just I want to talk a little bit.

59
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:45,537
Speaker 1: Hey, they're like hey, and then we start talking and I can say one thing they were pretty much anime manga Geeky people like everyone else like that seemed to be their primary thing.

60
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,784
Speaker 0: no shit You really you think so?

61
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:48,988
Speaker 0: 4chan people's.

62
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:55,047
Speaker 1: well the fun like in the anime gasp the funniest thing was so Alright, and they're telling me.

63
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:55,368
Speaker 1: I'm like.

64
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,111
Speaker 1: so what's going on?

65
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:59,445
Speaker 1: you guys doing one of your anonymous protests Is there a special occasion?

66
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:08,918
Speaker 1: it turned out that they said that weekend was like Dianetics push weekend And they were gonna be there kind of pointing out to people that Dianetics is just Scientology and everything that means.

67
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:09,883
Speaker 1: alright Which you know.

68
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:10,709
Speaker 1: I'm cool with that.

69
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,832
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then they're like hey Why don't you come cover it?

70
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:14,860
Speaker 1: and I was like well?

71
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:34,198
Speaker 1: I'd love to but actually in about an hour TM revolution and a hair squeak from this little crowd of people but I keep talking is gonna be in the Kinokuniya, and we're gonna be interviewing them for Japanese radio and The squeak happens again, and there's this one girl who bore a remarkable resemblance to knives.

72
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:37,386
Speaker 1: chow Basically said that's trouble.

73
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:38,209
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

74
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,900
Speaker 1: I'm like the biggest TMR fan ever I can't.

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,708
Speaker 1: He's really gonna be there, and I was like yeah.

76
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:43,452
Speaker 1: He's gonna be there.

77
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:44,999
Speaker 1: He's really gonna be the.

78
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:45,999
Speaker 1: yeah He's really gonna be there.

79
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:53,149
Speaker 1: and she was obviously torn 50/50 between continuing in her anonymous duties and Going to squeak at TMR.

80
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:53,792
Speaker 0: Yep.

81
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:55,259
Speaker 0: There are plenty of people squeaking.

82
00:04:56,182 --> 00:05:00,976
Speaker 1: It was quite an event that I've never seen that many people in such a small space before.

83
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:10,900
Speaker 0: all I have to say about it Now I mean I'm probably gonna say this every time we talk about this that guy is really small But at the same time there's so much energy.

84
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,950
Speaker 1: It's like the per pound energy in.

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,240
Speaker 1: that guy is probably the most energy any human has ever had.

86
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,406
Speaker 0: I'm not saying anything.

87
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:26,193
Speaker 1: It's good or bad, or I'm just saying he is a small Dude, I'm just saying that it's so like the smile never wore off.

88
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,179
Speaker 1: that guy is like concentrated like let's go.

89
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:28,958
Speaker 1: Let's go Let's go.

90
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:35,020
Speaker 1: But we'll talk about that more on Wednesday because we we got some interesting answers out of him to some of the questions.

91
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,852
Speaker 1: Yeah, the least yeah, it was a lot unlike what I expected.

92
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,183
Speaker 1: You know usually when you interview Japanese celebrities It's like well.

93
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:43,588
Speaker 1: What is your inspiration?

94
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,875
Speaker 1: Oh generic answer about my inspiration?

95
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:47,300
Speaker 1: What do you think about your fans?

96
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,674
Speaker 0: Serious and flat answer that I've been told to say.

97
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:58,145
Speaker 1: and when he said Something about if I had known that I would have my own Gundam when I was a kid I probably would have peed myself.

98
00:05:58,445 --> 00:05:59,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

99
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:00,191
Speaker 1: it was pretty fun.

100
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:03,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't know how the anonymous protests went out.

101
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,870
Speaker 1: I didn't see any mass media coverage, so I don't know.

102
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:15,030
Speaker 0: it wasn't a big anonymous protest obviously but really what they should just do is they just hold hands and make a little wall around the Stress testing booth, that's all they should do.

103
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,699
Speaker 0: that might be illegal is it?

104
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:23,560
Speaker 1: But what I will say I have a little bit of advice for anonymous But let people through if they ask because you know no you can't really do it that way.

105
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know we talked and they actually wanted geek nights fliers.

106
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:29,660
Speaker 1: I gave him a whole handful of them, and they seem pretty cool.

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,567
Speaker 1: But I know a lot of you were probably listening now anonymous, and I have.

108
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:34,650
Speaker 1: I have a little bit of advice.

109
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:50,880
Speaker 1: I Look at the way for those of you who were there that I was dressed and you guys I mean the the whole anonymous V laughing man thing works in his cool, but if you dressed like me And you were standing there looking very professional as opposed to

110
00:06:52,320 --> 00:07:01,032
Speaker 0: Look at the Scientologists right they're wearing like really nice pants and tucked in like button-down shirts like all the girls are wearing like dresses and whatnot.

111
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:08,690
Speaker 0: and So when someone goes up to them they you know they are crazy And you're not but you look crazy, and they don't.

112
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:14,289
Speaker 0: so someone who knows nothing about this whole situation Are they gonna trust the crazy punk kid?

113
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:14,750
Speaker 0: or they get it.

114
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:17,500
Speaker 0: it's like the socialists at all in college.

115
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,294
Speaker 0: They would always protest like you know out by the library.

116
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:21,460
Speaker 1: is there were always three of them?

117
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:29,271
Speaker 1: They're always like shirtless with dreadlocks yelling and screaming They smell bad that you know.

118
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:32,079
Speaker 0: and they they had like you know hemp hats and whatever.

119
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:56,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know, but it's like even if what they're saying is true or has merit they basically discredit themselves by acting hobos, so if you guys anonymous guys You know you have that little logo of like that little you know tuxedo that has no hands or a head or feet You should go where like you know your best Sunday clothes or whatever.

120
00:07:56,595 --> 00:08:06,128
Speaker 0: and you know act very serious and Polite and businesslike and friendly and then people will take you way more Seriously, and you'll be much more effective.

121
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:17,657
Speaker 1: because I will say watching that as the group grew And they're all these anonymous kids kind of hanging out in Brian Park getting ready to do their thing They were acting pretty much identically to the crowd at any anime convention.

122
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:21,014
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty anywhere It was I could have been in anime convention.

123
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:21,718
Speaker 0: They were having fun.

124
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,483
Speaker 0: They're having fun, but yeah, and they were probably somewhat effective But they could be.

125
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:32,909
Speaker 0: they could have fun and then also be more effective at the same time Seriously rock the blazer, and you'll get a lot more people.

126
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,400
Speaker 1: yeah ties work - ties do work not bow ties though.

127
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,812
Speaker 1: No bow ties the mark of a crazy man.

128
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:40,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's quite crazy.

129
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,118
Speaker 0: All right, you want to hit news all right?

130
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:49,144
Speaker 1: Scott will groan and moan about this, but I think this is grown so Zombie.

131
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:57,804
Speaker 1: I have to say very much that tomorrow is the Pennsylvania primary Democrats in America.

132
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,148
Speaker 1: this is critical.

133
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,080
Speaker 1: I cannot stress to you how much I support Barack Obama.

134
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:04,287
Speaker 1: It's not critical.

135
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:05,916
Speaker 0: He's already mathematically won.

136
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:06,700
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

137
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:11,374
Speaker 1: No, he hasn't because the super delegates could just vote for Hillary, but then the primary doesn't matter.

138
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,079
Speaker 1: yes the primary doesn't matter.

139
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,800
Speaker 0: So why was this critical part?

140
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,624
Speaker 1: No, no the whole primaries as a whole.

141
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:26,895
Speaker 1: the problem is if he wins this then pretty much the super delegates would have to stab Themselves it politically in order to actually vote.

142
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:30,408
Speaker 0: if you're a super delegate You're not also a pot like they're we.

143
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,733
Speaker 0: no one knows who those people are.

144
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:33,780
Speaker 1: you mean most of them are high-ranking Democrats.

145
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,429
Speaker 1: You can go look at the list of all of them.

146
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,520
Speaker 1: a lot of them are people who are well-known.

147
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:42,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean no one's gonna be like oh, you're a super delegate, and you voted for Hillary, but now I'm not voting for you.

148
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:45,097
Speaker 1: well actually that will happen but more beyond that.

149
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:53,380
Speaker 1: the problem Is that it's as a group if as a group they vote for a candidate that otherwise in terms of the media perspective lost the primary.

150
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:59,840
Speaker 1: Then a lot of people who voted in the primaries to suddenly feel betrayed, it's kind of like the Democratic Party falling.

151
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,840
Speaker 0: Yes, I don't think the super delegates themselves will take a hit.

152
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:06,200
Speaker 0: I think the Democratic Party will lose a lot of credibility.

153
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,280
Speaker 1: Individual super delegates will also take big hits.

154
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,227
Speaker 1: Maybe that's happened in the past.

155
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:18,067
Speaker 0: maybe if the media brings enough attention to specific ones then yes You realize that it's also within the party that.

156
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:19,312
Speaker 1: and what are you?

157
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:20,857
Speaker 1: you don't even know anything about politics.

158
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:21,800
Speaker 0: I know plenty.

159
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:28,911
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway if you live in Pennsylvania I encourage you to vote and you're a Democrat, and you had.

160
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:31,740
Speaker 1: you didn't miss the deadline to be a Democrat temporarily.

161
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:34,480
Speaker 1: I highly recommend you vote for Barack Obama.

162
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:43,583
Speaker 1: but that aside The debate that happened right ABC had a big debate and they'd so many debates that they had already 11.

163
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,168
Speaker 0: I think yeah, that's a lot.

164
00:10:45,570 --> 00:11:03,420
Speaker 1: yeah, I've watched most of them on YouTube yeah, but anyway I didn't watch the most recent one, but ABC because they staged the debate set down some guidelines Because the debate happened on the East Coast and live, but they had obligations to their West Coast affiliates.

165
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:05,267
Speaker 1: So what they said?

166
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:18,220
Speaker 1: this I'm gonna quote the New York Times here quote ABC's guidelines said that news organizations could select one 30-second sound bite to use on television radio or the web Between 11 p.m.. Wednesday and 5 a.m.. Thursday mm-hmm.

167
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:29,119
Speaker 1: So they basically said you can't show the debate you can't show any big clips from it You can't really do anything with it until we've been able to show it on the West Coast.

168
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,372
Speaker 1: Uh-huh luckily now.

169
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:32,520
Speaker 1: I have a lot to say about that.

170
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,217
Speaker 1: I mean yeah.

171
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:39,622
Speaker 1: Why don't they show at the same time on both coasts because then it it's at a time when no one's gonna watch it on The West Coast.

172
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,993
Speaker 0: have shit for living on the West Coast.

173
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:45,178
Speaker 0: you'll there'll be a West Coast debate later And you'll see that one, and we'll see.

174
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:48,035
Speaker 0: well Late to watch there won't be any more West Coast debates.

175
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:48,618
Speaker 0: well there were.

176
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:50,185
Speaker 1: Those didn't matter.

177
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:53,359
Speaker 1: well you had your chance and actually the debates were mostly out here.

178
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,148
Speaker 1: Anyway that they deal is that one.

179
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:02,487
Speaker 1: this smacks of media not understanding the world in that It's a global medium now.

180
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:05,399
Speaker 1: I can get information from anywhere in the world at the same time.

181
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:11,500
Speaker 1: so It'd be like if there was a hockey game in New York and there were fans of that hockey game in, Arizona.

182
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,340
Speaker 1: So they weren't allowed to broadcast the hockey game live.

183
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:24,478
Speaker 1: Instead they filmed the hockey game and wouldn't let anyone talk about their results Until it was prime time later, and then they showed it.

184
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:28,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, or they showed it on the East Coast But no one was allowed to talk about.

185
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:33,705
Speaker 0: of course people on the Internet people who are at the event live just go on the Internet and say what happened.

186
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:35,474
Speaker 1: yeah, but they can't show clips from it.

187
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:36,880
Speaker 1: They can't show highlights.

188
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,496
Speaker 1: They can't show a long like.

189
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:54,298
Speaker 1: well This is what Barack said blah blah blah blah, but it turns out that pretty much every news organization other than ABC Completely ignored this rule and showed very long Segments from the debate basically told ABC to piss off and cited fair use.

190
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,206
Speaker 0: yeah I say fair use.

191
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:57,873
Speaker 1: I'm so happy about that.

192
00:12:58,135 --> 00:12:59,280
Speaker 1: the way this has been handled.

193
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:03,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the timezone thing is gonna be an issue nowadays.

194
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:05,780
Speaker 0: You know the information travels so quickly.

195
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:09,660
Speaker 0: You know is you're gonna have events happening at times that are inconvenient for you.

196
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:15,360
Speaker 0: I mean just look there were a bunch of basketball and hockey games over the weekend right some of which I watched.

197
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:18,530
Speaker 0: But like there was some West Coast basketball games.

198
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,460
Speaker 0: They were late at night for me, and I didn't watch him.

199
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:22,799
Speaker 0: You know I just went to bed.

200
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:29,368
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess I only paid attention to the debates that were near me because they're actually 21. the rest of those must have been Out on the West Coast or something.

201
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:31,399
Speaker 0: yeah, when they would have been late at night for you.

202
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:34,751
Speaker 0: And at the same way when some you know some things will be.

203
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:39,551
Speaker 0: you know while West Coast people are still at work But they're prime time for us, and that's just.

204
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:41,500
Speaker 0: it's gonna be in the end.

205
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:45,040
Speaker 0: You know New York is on this side of country and LA is on that side of the country.

206
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:46,464
Speaker 0: It's gonna even out.

207
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,008
Speaker 0: people just have to deal with it.

208
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:51,980
Speaker 0: time shift get your TiVo's get your internets and everything will be cool.

209
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,763
Speaker 0: Whatever the thing

210
00:13:52,863 --> 00:14:06,342
Speaker 1: is part of the problem is that like these West Coast affiliates or whoever it is who isn't in the prime time zone Have a problem in that There's no point in them showing the debate because when it happens no one will watch it and no one's gonna watch it after the Fact because I

211
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:08,730
Speaker 0: don't show it just talk about it on the evening news,

212
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,300
Speaker 1: but then they lose a lot of the ad revenue They could have gotten by show it like having the right.

213
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,439
Speaker 0: But then there'll be another event that happens on the West Coast of the East Coast affiliate won't get.

214
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:18,881
Speaker 1: yeah That's.

215
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:27,880
Speaker 1: the problem is that in the global world people are trying to have it both ways where these West Coast affiliates want the benefits The global media and the fact that they can cover everything in the world.

216
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:32,580
Speaker 1: But they also don't want to have to compete with the media all around the world.

217
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:32,781
Speaker 1: Well,

218
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:50,999
Speaker 0: I think the real problem is that we still have you know these this idea of the local affiliate And I mean that was the reason that there are local affiliates is from a time where you needed an antenna to broadcast television into a local area and Now really the only reason you need a local affiliate is to make the local news everything

219
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:51,220
Speaker 1: else.

220
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:54,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the primary reason why we still have local affiliates.

221
00:14:54,226 --> 00:15:04,578
Speaker 0: Yeah They should really just have Like places around the country that make the local news and then everything else is just nationally controlled And they just say okay put all the local news is on at the right time.

222
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:06,124
Speaker 0: Because why do we need these?

223
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,515
Speaker 0: you know local affiliate that actually programs a whole thing?

224
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:10,579
Speaker 0: It's really just a waste.

225
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:16,180
Speaker 0: I mean, that's why cable TV has been rocking so much because cable TV is just same thing in the whole country.

226
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:17,869
Speaker 0: It's interesting thing in the whole world.

227
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,520
Speaker 1: It's interesting because all the cable debates We're pretty much broadcast live across all time zones and no one cares.

228
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,073
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean tell you the Fox News the CNN news is all those channel.

229
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:30,921
Speaker 0: the cable news channels are kicking the ass of the local Newses.

230
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:33,148
Speaker 0: all right, so yeah, it shows you

231
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:50,738
Speaker 1: but it was just I find that really interesting that it seems like ABC and actually multiple of the news stories that I read about this pointed out that ABC in all of their coverage and all of the ways they dealt with this tried to treat it like it was a TV show Like a television event as opposed to news.

232
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then all the cable networks treated these as news as a real-world thing.

233
00:15:56,673 --> 00:16:01,418
Speaker 1: that matters at ABC like even though in The end they were all just trying to make money.

234
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:02,423
Speaker 1: ABC.

235
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:11,520
Speaker 1: it was like if ABC was like yeah, we're trying to make money and everyone else was like yeah We're trying to cover the news and make money and as a result ABC just looks really really bad.

236
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:13,871
Speaker 0: No, ABC is Disney whatever.

237
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:14,896
Speaker 0: They're all bad.

238
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:19,219
Speaker 0: I Don't think any of them are good, okay, which one's good?

239
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:20,948
Speaker 1: Anyway, what do you got in the news?

240
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:22,575
Speaker 1: since you obviously don't care about this at all?

241
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:23,540
Speaker 0: no not really all right.

242
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:32,882
Speaker 1: So I still don't get how you cannot be so activist about everything yet not care about politics on any level local national state anything cuz like That.

243
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:33,544
Speaker 0: better things to do.

244
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:36,633
Speaker 0: the point of politics is in the perfect political world right?

245
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:38,398
Speaker 0: imagine if all politics is perfect.

246
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:42,914
Speaker 0: every Representative was was perfectly in line with what I wanted right.

247
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:45,887
Speaker 0: the goal the goal The perfect world would be.

248
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:48,400
Speaker 0: I just mind my own business and everything's great.

249
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:54,880
Speaker 0: And I realize hey I can just pretend mind my own business and pretend everything's great, and it'll be just like that.

250
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,320
Speaker 0: I just have to ignore all the bullshit, and it's like the bullshit uses in there uh-huh, and it's much better that way.

251
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,574
Speaker 1: Okay, I can't I couldn't disagree with you enough, but anyway go on.

252
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:10,117
Speaker 0: if I just turned off the news I would think the world was perfect, so I turn off the news, and I think the world is perfect.

253
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:14,449
Speaker 1: all right You're willing to go with the whole ignorance is bliss thing then go nuts.

254
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,633
Speaker 0: it works pretty well.

255
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:20,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway anyway, so Speaking of some bullshits.

256
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:26,108
Speaker 0: right we've been complaining about patents for 10 years 20 years 100 years I don't know.

257
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,020
Speaker 0: Patents are sucking especially the software patents.

258
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:38,039
Speaker 0: You know every day There's another story some company that doesn't actually make anything has a patent on some bullshit That shouldn't have been patentable in the first place.

259
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:51,333
Speaker 0: Then some other company that actually makes something like I don't know rim the blackberry company not rim the person over there or You know someone else has to pay a bajillion dollars or SEO.

260
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:52,777
Speaker 0: How long did that thing go on?

261
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:53,840
Speaker 0: remember rambas?

262
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, rambas all right.

263
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:56,768
Speaker 0: It's just a bunch of bullshit, right?

264
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:10,275
Speaker 0: well the head of the US patent office John Dudas the same guy apparently who was recently Trying to promote like an educate a patent educational curriculum for children.

265
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:11,920
Speaker 0: those things are always great, right.

266
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:15,673
Speaker 0: That was telling children that every inventor needs a patent.

267
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,119
Speaker 0: that yet, which is not true.

268
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:27,260
Speaker 0: This guy recently said that Yeah, the patent office is getting a bunch of really really shitty patents, and they're getting shittier by the day.

269
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:32,300
Speaker 0: That's a paraphrase, but he's basically saying the quality of patent applications is decreasing.

270
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:36,780
Speaker 0: huh He's just realizing this now.

271
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:42,637
Speaker 1: Well, I think the reason that patents are getting the way they are is that the reward for like.

272
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:43,680
Speaker 1: the reward for me.

273
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:50,640
Speaker 1: Oh, it's obvious why no, but the specific reward for making a broad patent is very very high.

274
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:53,093
Speaker 1: But the cost of making that patent is very very low.

275
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:58,476
Speaker 1: so all you have to do is Think about or look at what anyone else in any competitive arena is doing.

276
00:18:58,496 --> 00:18:59,319
Speaker 1: and then?

277
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:04,335
Speaker 1: Try to patent as many things as you can because you don't need to prove that something works to patent it.

278
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:16,198
Speaker 1: patent everything related To all the technology in the realm you compete and then just hope that something one of your competitors does in some vague way Overlaps that patent and then sue them for licensing fees.

279
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,203
Speaker 0: yeah And it's in.

280
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:22,085
Speaker 0: judges have been constantly deciding on the side of patent holders Which you know really?

281
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:24,994
Speaker 0: you know it used to be you didn't patent something so you actually had it.

282
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:29,560
Speaker 0: like you know Alexander Graham Bell He had a working phone, and then he ran to the patent office.

283
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:35,720
Speaker 0: You know Thomas Edison had a working light bulb And then he beat the other guy up on his way to the patent office, and he ended his in first.

284
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:37,011
Speaker 0: You know you they don't go.

285
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:42,214
Speaker 0: aha I have you know I've thought maybe we could have a light bulb and then patent it.

286
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:43,498
Speaker 0: that wasn't how it was done.

287
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:46,308
Speaker 0: and now Suddenly nowadays people are patenting things.

288
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:49,559
Speaker 0: I just thought of like yeah, I'm patenting the idea of a light bulb.

289
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:53,513
Speaker 0: I Don't even know how it's gonna work yet, but the real can't?

290
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:54,297
Speaker 0: anyone makes the one.

291
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:54,920
Speaker 0: I get the money.

292
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,186
Speaker 1: There's no simple solution.

293
00:19:56,226 --> 00:20:03,940
Speaker 1: I mean some people have said oh, we'll make the fee to apply for a patent hire But then that just prevents anyone who isn't a major corporation from ever getting a pen.

294
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:14,262
Speaker 0: Well, I actually think patent applications should be free like it shouldn't cost anything to apply But you should actually you should have to submit the working Invent.

295
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:24,238
Speaker 1: you know what I was about to say if you hadn't interrupted me was that Forcing someone to present the working invention is equally bad because a lot of times you can design something that will work.

296
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:32,325
Speaker 1: you can engineer Something and that's most of the effort, but the cost to actually build the thing you have engineered is Extremely prohibitive.

297
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:42,819
Speaker 1: so someone who's very intelligent who makes something good like a chip There's no way if I designed a chip that I could get someone to fabricate it Quickly and probably in a way that I could afford.

298
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:45,700
Speaker 0: Hmm that is a tough situation there.

299
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:54,570
Speaker 0: I think maybe you just had to either if you could prove that the cost of developing the Invention you know producing one was too high.

300
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:57,180
Speaker 1: How do you prove that proving that would cost a lot of money?

301
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,036
Speaker 0: No, if you could you would have to somehow prove that it was possible that it would actually work.

302
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:03,819
Speaker 0: how though?

303
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,531
Speaker 0: well If you can't prove that it works, then you know what.

304
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:08,439
Speaker 0: how difficult was it to come up with it?

305
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,163
Speaker 1: How can you?

306
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:09,946
Speaker 1: but what do you mean?

307
00:21:09,987 --> 00:21:12,780
Speaker 1: How do you prove that engineering design works without building it?

308
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:18,120
Speaker 1: With math that doesn't prove anything actually?

309
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,110
Speaker 0: Uh-huh not really well then what is?

310
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:23,099
Speaker 0: how good is your invention if we can't even prove that?

311
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:23,380
Speaker 0: was it?

312
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,524
Speaker 0: Why should we give you a patent?

313
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,775
Speaker 0: We can't even prove this thing you came up with actually works.

314
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:27,860
Speaker 0: What's it worth?

315
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,487
Speaker 1: Okay, so what do you propose?

316
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,394
Speaker 0: I do exactly what I just said.

317
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:34,040
Speaker 1: I just think it's a terrible idea.

318
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:35,448
Speaker 0: What's your great idea?

319
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:35,870
Speaker 0: genius.

320
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,956
Speaker 1: there is no great idea?

321
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:37,700
Speaker 1: That's what I was saying.

322
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,120
Speaker 1: We need a more fundamental reform than simply changing the patent application process.

323
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:56,579
Speaker 1: I think we need a clearer definition of The exact social and economic purpose that patents are intended to enact and then from there Go on to come up with policies that enact that idea as best as we can.

324
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,800
Speaker 1: I think opposed to trying to reform kind of the interface with the system.

325
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,748
Speaker 0: I think another problem that's been happening more recently.

326
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:12,186
Speaker 0: Is that it's a very it's tough to tell like where invention stops and where Innovation the Microsoft Word begins.

327
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:19,308
Speaker 0: like if if you know if I invent an improvement to something that already exists like, you know Is that really a new invention?

328
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:20,814
Speaker 0: Well, how obvious was it?

329
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,220
Speaker 0: What if it was a little bit obvious?

330
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,677
Speaker 0: What if it was really, you know?

331
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:27,209
Speaker 0: Is this sliding scale and we have to sort of figure out?

332
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,297
Speaker 0: where do we draw the line as to okay your?

333
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:39,420
Speaker 0: Contribution was significant enough to where you deserve some sort of rights to money or or you know, monopoly or something.

334
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:42,076
Speaker 0: Your contribution was not significant.

335
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:42,780
Speaker 0: You don't get anything.

336
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:49,520
Speaker 1: Well, frankly, I think the best way to go about it would be to reform the system So that the limited monopoly is reduced sharply to a very small span.

337
00:22:49,620 --> 00:23:07,851
Speaker 1: Like maybe you apply for a patent and you don't have to submit a working model but the patent guy takes effect and starts working when you produce the thing and then from that point and obviously a time delay whereby if you don't get it produced between when you submit the patent and This arbitrary deadline say

338
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:08,414
Speaker 0: I'll see that.

339
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:09,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, those are those it first.

340
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good one.

341
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:14,040
Speaker 0: If you don't if you don't make it then you lose the patent.

342
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,280
Speaker 1: Well, if you let me finish there's a lot more to it than that.

343
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:25,879
Speaker 1: So first you submit the patent and then if the patent is accepted then from that point You have an arbitrary span of say up to a year to get someone to produce whatever it is.

344
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:33,603
Speaker 1: And if you do then from the time it is produced you have a temporary monopoly of say another short term like two years Maybe at most.

345
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:46,046
Speaker 1: but going along with this we add much stronger protections on trademarks of branding and that sort of thing so that you get the actual monopoly for a short term.

346
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,954
Speaker 1: you get the buffer time to prove that it was viable.

347
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:51,059
Speaker 1: because if it was viable you patent it.

348
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:53,852
Speaker 1: Someone will decide that it's worth investing in.

349
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:59,173
Speaker 1: if no one decides it's worth investing in then Obviously your patent was either ahead of its time or in other ways wouldn't work.

350
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:04,655
Speaker 1: and then obviously the patent expires Maybe with a clause that it can be reapplied for again in the future.

351
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:05,679
Speaker 1: doesn't some sort of delay?

352
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:15,407
Speaker 1: So, alright so now after you build it you that company that built it and you get a temporary monopoly of a couple of years to milk It for money and to establish your brand.

353
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,936
Speaker 1: but then after that short monopoly the monopolies gone.

354
00:24:19,237 --> 00:24:20,300
Speaker 1: anyone else can compete.

355
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:23,553
Speaker 1: but you still have the soft monopoly that you were there.

356
00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:32,300
Speaker 1: first you have the branding and It'll kind of it caused this long trail off of your monopoly instead of the hard long term.

357
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:35,640
Speaker 0: I think I think that's a good idea for consumer type products.

358
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:41,514
Speaker 0: But actually I see a problem in that There are things in this world which take a very long time to make.

359
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:49,194
Speaker 0: if I patent some sort of new Like, you know equivalent of you know, the Hadron Collider It's gonna take a lot like ten years to build it.

360
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,360
Speaker 0: if we do build it, right?

361
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:52,751
Speaker 1: Like that should really be patented.

362
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:57,816
Speaker 0: maybe maybe but you know There are some things which take an incredibly long time to actually make.

363
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,950
Speaker 0: or you know Maybe we make one.

364
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,360
Speaker 1: you want me to go into more detail.

365
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:10,420
Speaker 1: I think not so simple as just it came off the production line But you set up a stipulation whereby the infrastructure is being built to put it in place.

366
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:13,600
Speaker 0: I think what you need to do actually is the pat.

367
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,597
Speaker 0: I think you need to actually give the patent examiners more, you know leeway you don't set.

368
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:20,002
Speaker 0: you know this long It's.

369
00:25:20,022 --> 00:25:24,060
Speaker 0: they look at the patent and they say this should take, you know, no more than X years.

370
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:31,879
Speaker 1: I hate to say it but I think that's an almost ludicrous idea because that implies that you have to have the patent examiners be experts in every possible field.

371
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,003
Speaker 0: Well, there are.

372
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:35,813
Speaker 0: they have a zillion patent examiners and they're each.

373
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:41,711
Speaker 0: they have whatever you're submitting a patent for They should have at least one expert in that field, but that's prohibitively expensive.

374
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,693
Speaker 0: That's what.

375
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:43,796
Speaker 0: that's how that?

376
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:45,080
Speaker 1: I don't think that's a good idea.

377
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:56,720
Speaker 1: I think that the patent office should be fairly liberal with this kind of system in awarding patents because a patent that is to blur Fluous will either be ignored by investors or will not be enacted.

378
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:56,861
Speaker 1: But

379
00:25:56,881 --> 00:26:11,815
Speaker 0: I don't think if there's a pet if they're no matter what the system is if you have some sort of Patenting if the person who approves or denies the patent isn't incredibly knowledgeable in the topic at hand I don't think they're qualified to make a judgment as a yes

380
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:15,067
Speaker 1: or no about the way My system was put in the way it is set up.

381
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:22,760
Speaker 1: Even if a bad patent gets in it's a very short span and With the trademark protection and all that it I think it would work out really well.

382
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:36,440
Speaker 0: I also think that you know some like if the patent office doesn't have someone who's an expert right there should be some sort You know like they already have sort of a system where you know citizens can go and look at patents and make comments on them.

383
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:39,311
Speaker 0: I really think that should be expanded like huh?

384
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:41,400
Speaker 0: I'm not a hundred percent sure on this.

385
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:47,127
Speaker 0: I'm going to mail it to an incredibly smart college professor who's an expert in this area And then he will mail it back.

386
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:57,260
Speaker 1: a big problem with that is once you give people that sort of Scientific or knowledge based control over the system you have those people are often engaged in the industry anyway.

387
00:26:57,622 --> 00:26:59,412
Speaker 0: That's why you don't do just one person.

388
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:02,423
Speaker 0: you do like a. you know a bunch of Review action.

389
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:14,377
Speaker 1: all of those people are engaged in the industry and unlike the side the hard sciences when you're getting into consumer technology Finding even a quorum of people who are not biased is pretty much impossible.

390
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:15,260
Speaker 0: It's very difficult.

391
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:25,780
Speaker 1: I think the easiest way to fix it for the least amount of reform and effort and problems is simply to have the very short Monopoly coupled with the buffer period before going building a proof of concept.

392
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:38,480
Speaker 0: I don't think if nothing else we agree that the time and the amount of monopoly the patents give you has to be much shorter Especially considering the speed at which you know technology is advancing compared to say you know the the early 1900s.

393
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:44,769
Speaker 1: well honestly I'm also of the mind more and more that Only physical things should be able to be patented.

394
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,660
Speaker 1: absolutely not just not just like oh software patents are bad.

395
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,615
Speaker 1: But I don't think you should even be able to patent a business process or a business plan.

396
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:54,989
Speaker 1: I know only Physical engineered objects.

397
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,114
Speaker 0: yes absolutely.

398
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,288
Speaker 0: if something is an idea I mean all software is a number.

399
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:01,236
Speaker 0: so saying you can patent that no good.

400
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:02,220
Speaker 0: now see here's the end.

401
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,350
Speaker 0: You should also not be able to.

402
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,540
Speaker 0: it should only be man-made objects.

403
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,832
Speaker 0: I don't like this patenting jeans stuff, right, but what if I made the gene?

404
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:11,960
Speaker 1: if you chemically that which is that's how we do.

405
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,780
Speaker 0: We make you chemically engineer something in a chemical plant right you make it then that's a man-made chemical.

406
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:21,799
Speaker 0: But if you just take it out of my arm and look at it in a microscope you didn't make it.

407
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,622
Speaker 0: So it doesn't count.

408
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:24,710
Speaker 0: yeah, that's how I say it should be.

409
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,877
Speaker 1: well even then you don't patent the end result.

410
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:27,760
Speaker 1: you patent the process.

411
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:28,443
Speaker 0: That's fine.

412
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:41,449
Speaker 0: as long as there's a process involving the business process the engineering process As long as you're making a physical thing like if you figure out how to make you know the same Gene that comes out of my arm right and you make it.

413
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,720
Speaker 0: you can patent though the you know chemical process of how you made It.

414
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,202
Speaker 0: that's fine.

415
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:54,508
Speaker 1: plus regardless the short-term monopoly with the buffer period and all that Basically makes it so that no matter how bad.

416
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:56,113
Speaker 1: the mistakes are in the patent office.

417
00:28:56,394 --> 00:29:01,633
Speaker 1: they get resolved relatively quickly And a cycle of two years is the longest.

418
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,400
Speaker 1: well even with the buffer period alright.

419
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:08,995
Speaker 1: So a bad patent gets through worst-case scenario three years of misery, and then everything's fine.

420
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:09,898
Speaker 1: I'm cool with that.

421
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:10,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's fun.

422
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:22,917
Speaker 1: Anyway things of the day nothing is funnier to me than cats confronted with obstacles They cannot understand.

423
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,030
Speaker 0: did you see that one a couple weeks ago?

424
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:37,082
Speaker 0: That was like the guy had a glass door in front of you know at his front door You know we have a screen door beat a glass screen door, and he took the glass out But the dog like wouldn't go through unless he actually opened the door.

425
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:37,885
Speaker 1: cuz think about that.

426
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:39,630
Speaker 1: the dog knows better if he just runs At.

427
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:45,370
Speaker 0: that thing hit something, but then the guy himself walked through the hole and the dog still didn't get it.

428
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,635
Speaker 1: Well, that was just a dumb dog.

429
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:49,246
Speaker 0: I know, but you know what I'm saying, but that's funny.

430
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:50,574
Speaker 1: basically This is.

431
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:52,528
Speaker 1: I don't know the exact story, but you know those.

432
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:58,390
Speaker 1: Uh I'm gonna call this is an inside joke for those archangel dark angel cakes the ones you get it like a grocery store.

433
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,398
Speaker 1: It's like a big.

434
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:02,335
Speaker 0: you go to the grocery store, and you say hey I see that blank cake there.

435
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,584
Speaker 0: write this on the right archangel dark angel.

436
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:05,849
Speaker 1: Lend me thy ear on it.

437
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:13,687
Speaker 1: no That's a story from the guy kind of the golden age of the front row crew something like that.

438
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,384
Speaker 1: well Maybe the Silver Age.

439
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:15,768
Speaker 1: I don't know.

440
00:30:16,252 --> 00:30:16,754
Speaker 0: Definitely.

441
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:20,149
Speaker 0: that was definitely like pre goes the ancient times.

442
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:26,990
Speaker 1: But uh by the way just so you know those cakes in the grocery store are full of trans fat.

443
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,061
Speaker 0: Don't eat those cakes don't want to get.

444
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:35,430
Speaker 1: those aren't good cakes cuz we One of the FRC people had a birthday a few months ago, and I was like we should buy a cake.

445
00:30:35,571 --> 00:30:36,277
Speaker 1: We used to do that.

446
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:37,570
Speaker 1: We used to always get one of those cakes.

447
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:43,867
Speaker 1: It was like a big deal when I remember to Which what we get them all the time at our IT because ice cream cake is a good way to go.

448
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,112
Speaker 0: a little carvel get The whale.

449
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:45,917
Speaker 0: I like the whale.

450
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,230
Speaker 1: I think those have trans fat - I also like the watermelon.

451
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:54,749
Speaker 1: But anyway those things as we discovered recently are like loaded with trans fat.

452
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,795
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm no fan of you know.

453
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:57,638
Speaker 0: you know I'm not.

454
00:30:57,678 --> 00:31:00,085
Speaker 0: I'm not big on the nutrition, but trans fat.

455
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:13,308
Speaker 1: I mean it's pretty much poison Followed closely by high fructose corn, but anyway those trans fat cakes always come with this big plastic Shell to keep them fresh even though if you take that shell off that thing is never gonna rot.

456
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:15,816
Speaker 0: nope But so much preservatives in there.

457
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:18,384
Speaker 0: I mean the frosting will get hard and crusty, but that's about it.

458
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:20,310
Speaker 1: now cats love these things.

459
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,935
Speaker 1: I've experienced this firsthand.

460
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:27,410
Speaker 1: cats like a lot of things, but particularly those archangel dark angel cakes cats.

461
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:29,157
Speaker 1: We'll just go nuts over these things.

462
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:32,670
Speaker 1: if you leave one out, and you have a cat that cake is forfeit.

463
00:31:33,313 --> 00:31:37,170
Speaker 1: But uh if you leave the shell on it the cat can't get to the cake.

464
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:39,422
Speaker 1: But that doesn't mean he isn't gonna try.

465
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:40,930
Speaker 1: and that's my thing of the day.

466
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:48,929
Speaker 1: This is hilarious because he's just like Homer when he's trying to get to that almost there almost there.

467
00:31:49,010 --> 00:32:04,849
Speaker 0: All right my thing of the day my thing of the day is going to be a a Shakespearean performance by me and rim here rim and I and If you don't know which actually Scott it would be by me and rim.

468
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:07,621
Speaker 1: Yeah, by rim and me because you know you said two.

469
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:09,630
Speaker 0: so it would be by rim and myself.

470
00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:10,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, there we go.

471
00:32:11,186 --> 00:32:16,804
Speaker 0: so If you don't know which Shakespearean play we are performing.

472
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:18,289
Speaker 0: you're a moron.

473
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:23,659
Speaker 1: well I'll be more to the point if you don't get the joke from the very first line.

474
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,854
Speaker 1: you obviously Didn't get it.

475
00:32:26,075 --> 00:32:30,688
Speaker 0: Yeah, um and Then we're gonna link you to the the script for this.

476
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:34,030
Speaker 0: this year We're just gonna do a very small part like not even like a scene.

477
00:32:34,191 --> 00:32:35,236
Speaker 0: It's gonna be like a piece of a scene.

478
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:42,203
Speaker 1: I uh I'll admit I laughed out loud Before I finish reading the first line because suddenly I realized what this was.

479
00:32:42,223 --> 00:32:44,350
Speaker 0: I don't screw up the lines like you did last time.

480
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,392
Speaker 1: What last time?

481
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:46,836
Speaker 0: but the first time.

482
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:55,143
Speaker 0: okay, yeah, all right all right, so I'll begin and Knowest thou what the French name cottage pie say.

483
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:56,950
Speaker 1: they not cottage pie in their own tongue.

484
00:32:57,231 --> 00:33:02,010
Speaker 0: But nay their tongues for speech and taste alike are strange to ours with their own history.

485
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:04,437
Speaker 0: Gall knoweth not a cottage from a house.

486
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:05,520
Speaker 1: What say they then?

487
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:08,790
Speaker 1: pray hatches permentier hatches permentier.

488
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,057
Speaker 0: What name thy cream cream is but cream only.

489
00:33:12,097 --> 00:33:13,480
Speaker 0: they say la creme.

490
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,466
Speaker 1: What do they name black pudding?

491
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:16,551
Speaker 0: I know not.

492
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:17,876
Speaker 0: I visited no in.

493
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:18,700
Speaker 0: it could be bought.

494
00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:22,329
Speaker 0: Do you want to keep going?

495
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:23,720
Speaker 1: I think we can do the second one.

496
00:33:23,861 --> 00:33:25,028
Speaker 0: We're gonna do the second scene.

497
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:26,174
Speaker 0: We might mess this one up though.

498
00:33:26,194 --> 00:33:27,120
Speaker 0: We didn't practice this one.

499
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,711
Speaker 1: Do you want to be the awesome part or the get shot part?

500
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:31,955
Speaker 0: I will do.

501
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:33,680
Speaker 0: I was doing the awesome part.

502
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,565
Speaker 0: I could keep doing the awesome.

503
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,389
Speaker 1: Okay, you'd better do it.

504
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:36,595
Speaker 1: Well, all right do it.

505
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:41,440
Speaker 0: Well young My Pardon, did I break thy concentration?

506
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,622
Speaker 0: Continue.

507
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:44,728
Speaker 0: Ah, but now thy tongue is still.

508
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:46,794
Speaker 0: allow me then to offer a response.

509
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:48,920
Speaker 0: describe Marcellus Wallace to me.

510
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,026
Speaker 0: Pray what.

511
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,299
Speaker 0: what country dost thou hail from?

512
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,121
Speaker 0: What.

513
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:54,265
Speaker 0: how passing.

514
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:57,798
Speaker 0: strange for I have traveled far and never have I heard tell of this.

515
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:58,160
Speaker 0: what?

516
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,046
Speaker 0: What language speak they in the land of what?

517
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:05,058
Speaker 0: what the Queen's own English-based knave dost thou speak it?

518
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,589
Speaker 0: I Then harken to my words and answer them.

519
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,440
Speaker 0: describe to me Marcellus Wallace what?

520
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,764
Speaker 0: Speak what again thou cur cry.

521
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:15,386
Speaker 0: what again?

522
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:20,340
Speaker 0: I dare the utter what again but once I dare thee twice and spit upon thy name.

523
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:26,620
Speaker 0: Now paint for me a portraiture in words if thou hast any in thy head, but what of Marcellus Wallace?

524
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,123
Speaker 1: He is dark.

525
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:33,254
Speaker 1: I and what more his head is shaven bald.

526
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,079
Speaker 0: Has he the semblance of a harlot?

527
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:35,520
Speaker 0: What?

528
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:39,367
Speaker 0: ah Has he the semblance of a harlot?

Speaker 0: Oh, I thou didst thou hope to rape him like a chattel whore and south Lord Wallace is displeased to bed with anyone but she to whom he wed This?

532
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:58,063
Speaker 0: I I don't know.

533
00:34:58,104 --> 00:34:59,226
Speaker 0: I think that's all there is.

534
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:00,409
Speaker 1: I love this sort of thing.

535
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:08,032
Speaker 0: I We're gonna link to it anyway to give credit where credit is due.

536
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:09,258
Speaker 1: credit is indeed to mr.

537
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,662
Speaker 0: Cerulean st.

538
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:15,614
Speaker 0: On the live journals or perhaps Darth Paradox.

539
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:18,122
Speaker 0: I can't tell I don't get live journal No, whatever.

540
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:27,360
Speaker 1: All I know is that it bothers me that now it asks me if I am if I am 14 before I'm allowed to view certain live journals whatever.

541
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:30,893
Speaker 1: So, uh, what shall we talk about?

542
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:32,340
Speaker 0: I do want to talk about the RF IDs.

543
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:35,575
Speaker 1: I think we should because there was a. this will be a kind of short show.

544
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:36,580
Speaker 0: I won't be that short.

545
00:35:36,982 --> 00:35:39,432
Speaker 0: Well, I think you could go as long as you wanted to.

546
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:41,360
Speaker 1: actually I'm kind of hungry and I am hungry.

547
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:44,483
Speaker 1: I actually want to skip all the technology I want to.

548
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:45,428
Speaker 0: I want to talk about you guys.

549
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:46,535
Speaker 0: only cover the basic.

550
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:48,160
Speaker 0: that way they understand All right.

551
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,952
Speaker 1: So an RF ID is very simply a small it will.

552
00:35:52,212 --> 00:35:54,058
Speaker 1: there are common misconceptions about RF IDs.

553
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:57,069
Speaker 1: one Is that they broadcast information about you?

554
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,197
Speaker 0: They do not broadcast information about you.

555
00:35:59,338 --> 00:35:59,780
Speaker 0: what they do?

556
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:05,627
Speaker 1: They're a little inert piece of metal and a chip Yeah and a little antenna and all they do.

557
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:07,092
Speaker 1: it's called RF ID.

558
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:16,880
Speaker 1: if an RF signal is present it has to be a fairly strong one because Remember RF will if there's a wire a conductor cause a small amount of current to go across it.

559
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,187
Speaker 1: exactly kind of like if you take a magnet and you move it back and forth or spin it in the presence of a wire a Charge will appear on that one.

560
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:25,380
Speaker 0: You take an extension cord need to play jump rope with it.

561
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:33,117
Speaker 0: You can actually I get a light bulb to light up Standing if you're standing in the right orientation to the the gravitation the magnetic field of the earth.

562
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,220
Speaker 1: Yes, not gravitation.

563
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you had somehow linked you have to be standing what east-west or north-south?

564
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,161
Speaker 0: I forget.

565
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:47,640
Speaker 1: if you had somehow linked the gravitational forces with the electromagnetic forces You would have just achieved the holy grail of all sighs.

566
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:52,920
Speaker 1: Better than Einstein would have solved the most fundamental problem physics has ever offered unto man.

567
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,194
Speaker 0: But anyway, but anyway, so RF ID.

568
00:36:55,214 --> 00:37:11,752
Speaker 1: you basically have this Simple in the presence of an RF field a Current will go through this chip which will cause it to broadcast in a very small span through its little antenna Powered by the RF signal a small series of bits.

569
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:20,159
Speaker 0: in other words radio goes into the chip onto across an antenna powers it at each the chip powers up and then radio comes out.

570
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:25,533
Speaker 0: and Actually if you put more radio in you can get more radio out.

571
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,680
Speaker 0: so theoretically, you know, it's the same radio.

572
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:30,503
Speaker 0: It's not gonna change what it's broadcast It's just gonna.

573
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:34,119
Speaker 1: it's like if I'm the brought the thing and Scott is the RF ID.

574
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:36,449
Speaker 1: I go Hey, and Scott goes what.

575
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:38,740
Speaker 1: and I go hey, he goes what?

576
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:49,320
Speaker 0: Exactly the louder you yell at it the louder it yells back But it's always gonna yell back less than you yelled at it because it's a tiny little thing that's powered only by the RF.

577
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,780
Speaker 0: That's why RF IDs don't have batteries in them.

578
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,683
Speaker 0: They don't need batteries.

579
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:57,420
Speaker 0: all the the the radio waves coming at it provide all the power that is needed.

580
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,742
Speaker 1: You know what?

581
00:37:57,782 --> 00:38:00,013
Speaker 1: The nicest thing is about farting in an air on chair.

582
00:38:00,636 --> 00:38:01,360
Speaker 0: It goes right through.

583
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:03,545
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm sorry about that.

584
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:07,275
Speaker 0: So our FID technology has been used in many places.

585
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:14,620
Speaker 0: in many places is replace the barcode Right because now instead of having to turn something over and finding the barcode or whatever, right?

586
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:21,283
Speaker 0: All you do is you zap an RF radio wave at it and then wherever the RF ID is, you know It's in there somewhere.

587
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:23,149
Speaker 0: It'll broadcast back.

588
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:31,363
Speaker 0: Hey, here's my ID number and then you say, okay and then you know what it is and you look it up in the database and you charge them the right amount of money or It's great.

589
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:33,940
Speaker 1: Like my badge for work has an RF ID, right?

590
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,437
Speaker 0: So rim goes up to his office and the thing near his office says, you know, it's always going.

591
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:39,139
Speaker 0: Hey RF ID.

592
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,403
Speaker 0: Hey, hey and rim waves his RF ID near it and then he's I don't even do that There's multiple of them.

593
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:48,280
Speaker 1: Actually, there's there's turnstiles to even get to the elevator to get to my part of the building.

594
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:53,940
Speaker 1: Oh, wow, and when I walk up the turnstile says oh, it's rim and it opens and I walk in and it closes behind.

595
00:38:54,061 --> 00:38:56,100
Speaker 0: No, that's a more powerful one than what we got.

596
00:38:56,261 --> 00:39:05,723
Speaker 1: It's actually really cool because it's timed so perfectly that only One dude is getting through that thing and I see people try to get through it and it just hits them right in the mean Mean machine.

597
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:07,232
Speaker 0: Oh, it's so excellent.

598
00:39:07,252 --> 00:39:08,560
Speaker 1: Yeah people get hit by that thing.

599
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:12,796
Speaker 0: Yes, so it's it's rim has a little RF ID that he carries to work, you know, and they have.

600
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:13,720
Speaker 0: they have a database.

601
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:20,098
Speaker 0: Yep, they have a database that says this number is allowed in this number is not allowed in and then rim walks up.

602
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:22,206
Speaker 0: the RF ID is somewhere on rims body.

603
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:33,007
Speaker 0: He doesn't have to whip it out because it's really powerful and it says hey Hey, and then rims RF ID goes I'm rim and their database says rims allowed into the door opens the rim walks into the door closed and then

604
00:39:33,027 --> 00:39:40,053
Speaker 1: I go upstairs and I stand outside the door of my office and then the Door unlocks because it knows it's me now depending on the employee.

605
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:44,090
Speaker 1: It looks up and says, oh, it's rim He's allowed to come in 24/7.

606
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,518
Speaker 1: Oh, it's so-and-so the janitor He's not allowed to come in except between these hours and these hours.

607
00:39:49,538 --> 00:39:51,540
Speaker 0: or yeah Oh, that's all in the database.

608
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:57,083
Speaker 0: You know the RF ID just has an ID number and that's the primary Misconception.

609
00:39:57,123 --> 00:40:02,276
Speaker 1: that why so many people are afraid of RF IDs that it'd be broadcast in my business.

610
00:40:02,437 --> 00:40:03,560
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's my business.

611
00:40:04,122 --> 00:40:05,409
Speaker 0: Now there is that.

612
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:07,177
Speaker 0: that's not to say the RF ID is perfect.

613
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:07,800
Speaker 0: there are problems.

614
00:40:07,962 --> 00:40:09,360
Speaker 1: I mean, we'll cover this first.

615
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:18,430
Speaker 1: Remember the key here is that in General the way an RF ID works is that it'll be a number like a serial number like I have my number two four six Oh one and great number.

616
00:40:18,913 --> 00:40:22,400
Speaker 1: That's one of my favorite numbers Other than e to the XC anyway.

617
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,009
Speaker 1: So this number doesn't tell you anything about me.

618
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,995
Speaker 0: It's just my silver plate asshole.

619
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:29,820
Speaker 1: It's just and candelabra.

620
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:31,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just my number.

621
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:42,740
Speaker 1: and Knowing that number doesn't help you on a Getting my business information unless you also have access to the back-end database system.

622
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is why RF ID security is really just database security.

623
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,579
Speaker 0: I mean if you know different than a key.

624
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:56,920
Speaker 1: It's no different than because a key is just a look-up except the database is physical and local and trivially broken.

625
00:40:57,282 --> 00:41:00,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean are it has one it is a key.

626
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:08,560
Speaker 0: All of the Most of the privacy concerns with RF ID are really just database privacy concerns.

627
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:17,714
Speaker 1: They're really not any different, you know, yeah, I mean say alright So I've got the number and I'm walking around the anime con that's using the numbers.

628
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,653
Speaker 1: someone snooping Well just could say, huh?

629
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:30,894
Speaker 1: Well, like we can see that this RF ID went into this room and went into this room or this RF ID was standing here Or if they were snooping on the con goer level like they walk around.

630
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:40,490
Speaker 1: they're like well rims numbers 2 4 6 0 1 and Scott's number is negative 8 and and that girl's number is 4009 but that number doesn't tell them anything now here.

631
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,240
Speaker 0: Here are some situations where it could get a little tricky, right?

632
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:48,614
Speaker 0: Let's say someone at rims work the person who say managed this RF ID system.

633
00:41:48,995 --> 00:41:50,780
Speaker 0: They know what rims number is, right?

634
00:41:51,342 --> 00:42:07,440
Speaker 0: So they go to some say I don't know Political event and they just walk around to the little radio looking for RF IDs and they're picking up numbers and suddenly they pick up a number and it's rims number and they can sort of figure out which direction is coming from kind of.

635
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,300
Speaker 0: so They yeah, and then sure enough there's rim, right?

636
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,667
Speaker 0: So now they they sort of know rims.

637
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:16,540
Speaker 0: rims at this event rims a Barack Obama supporter, right?

638
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,144
Speaker 0: So they go.

639
00:42:17,366 --> 00:42:21,624
Speaker 1: he's at an ACLU meeting Expected that what it does.

640
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:24,232
Speaker 0: the the the real thing to worry about.

641
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:50,897
Speaker 0: it's not really anything to worry about but the the theoretical dangers of RF ID are that someone who gave you an RF ID someone who already has a match of Your RF ID to their database can then if they are physically near enough to you Right sort of track your general location, you know and add that location Data to their existing database of information about you.

642
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:59,740
Speaker 1: now In terms of I think the way this show is going now that we've talked a bit is we're only gonna talk about Not the technology and not even the good uses of it so much.

643
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:02,097
Speaker 1: I think I just want to talk about all the security concerns.

644
00:43:02,157 --> 00:43:03,204
Speaker 0: pretty much Yeah, I could do.

645
00:43:03,244 --> 00:43:09,943
Speaker 1: we could do a whole show on the awesome and privacy also Yeah, but just in terms of security and privacy I mean the.

646
00:43:10,164 --> 00:43:12,972
Speaker 1: here's the biggest real concern you could have.

647
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:18,055
Speaker 1: but I think I want to point out at the end Why I don't think it's as big a concern as people are making it out to be.

648
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:22,493
Speaker 1: so let's say RF IDs eventually and this will happen will be in everything.

649
00:43:22,514 --> 00:43:27,290
Speaker 1: every article of clothing I mean tires for cars already have RF IDs in them.

650
00:43:27,511 --> 00:43:30,240
Speaker 1: Yep, but products will start to have RF IDs.

651
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:36,557
Speaker 1: now It won't be linked like I buy a shirt and it has a number that says this is rimmed shirt in it.

652
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:40,679
Speaker 1: every Hanes Whatever shirt will probably have the exact same number.

653
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:44,033
Speaker 1: So even if you try to cross-link database is like alright.

654
00:43:44,615 --> 00:43:45,880
Speaker 1: rim bought a Hanes t-shirt.

655
00:43:46,462 --> 00:43:50,072
Speaker 1: Oh, look a Hanes t-shirt walked by my RF day ID reader.

656
00:43:50,433 --> 00:43:52,580
Speaker 1: So did a thousand other Hanes t-shirts.

657
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, and even if they did have different numbers, right?

658
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,460
Speaker 0: Let's say each Hanes t-shirt had a unique number, right?

659
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:58,595
Speaker 0: It was like IPv6, right?

660
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,667
Speaker 0: Okay, so, you know that a Hanes t-shirt went by.

661
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:09,189
Speaker 0: unless you have access to the Hanes t-shirt database or perhaps the retail store Database rim bought the t-shirt.

662
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:10,779
Speaker 1: even I could have paid cash.

663
00:44:11,229 --> 00:44:11,620
Speaker 0: That's right.

664
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:18,840
Speaker 0: So unless rim work it rim paid with a credit card and you either have the Kohl's database or the Hanes database.

665
00:44:19,463 --> 00:44:22,699
Speaker 0: You're not gonna know that the Hanes t-shirt that just walked by was rim.

666
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:35,138
Speaker 0: You know to have access to the databases, which means you really only have to worry about Hanes or Kohl's Following you around or something or being you know Broadcasting RF IDs in areas where you go and

667
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:50,110
Speaker 1: also the people who are so afraid about the stores finding out what you buy if You use credit cards at all Then all those concerns are out the window because they already know everything about you And you know what they do track that data stores constantly track what credit.

668
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, are you are using a little fun saver card at the grocery store?

669
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,754
Speaker 0: Cuz even if you pay with cash use that little, you know Club Savings Card Guess what?

670
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:01,190
Speaker 1: Of course, I use one that I found on the ground a number of years ago.

671
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:10,319
Speaker 0: So does Scott and so does Emily and so does Alex sometimes Yeah, and you can just you if you want one of those things at the grocery store You can just fill out false information.

672
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:11,103
Speaker 0: They'll hand you one right.

673
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:12,510
Speaker 1: then depends on the groceries.

674
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:22,353
Speaker 0: It does depend on the grocery store, but in my experience you can just go up and be like, I'm Joey Jojo Shabdo I live on five Pine Street in this town that this grocery store It's now.

675
00:45:22,373 --> 00:45:25,687
Speaker 1: they'll only give you a temporary one and then they'll mail you the real one.

676
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:26,410
Speaker 1: That's fine.

677
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:30,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll use the temporary one and every time I come to the store I get a new temporary one.

678
00:45:30,598 --> 00:45:32,590
Speaker 1: that but you were gonna go for all that trouble.

679
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:38,668
Speaker 1: I'll just get the thing cuz I don't care if the food line knows that I buy hams every Thursday.

680
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:43,449
Speaker 0: actually It's really yet to decide, you know, do you care more about them?

681
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:49,996
Speaker 0: you know look using your information against you as a way to sell you more shit or The other way to look at it.

682
00:45:50,076 --> 00:45:53,030
Speaker 0: is you know, are they gonna make your shopping experience better?

683
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:59,207
Speaker 0: I kind of want them to know that I buy this bread every week because then they'll keep that bread in stock and it won't Sell out of it.

684
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:07,070
Speaker 1: Yeah or this group of people always buy all this Asian food and They also tend to buy the very expensive things in the other part of the and they come on Friday.

685
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:12,349
Speaker 1: so what if we stock more of these ramens that they're always buying and we make sure they're in stock on Friday?

686
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,872
Speaker 1: and They'll?

687
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,399
Speaker 1: because we know that they're big spenders.

688
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:17,247
Speaker 1: Anyway, they're more likely to buy that stuff.

689
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:21,057
Speaker 1: Yep but here's the more paranoid.

690
00:46:21,097 --> 00:46:23,503
Speaker 1: can security concern and this is the.

691
00:46:23,984 --> 00:46:32,570
Speaker 1: if I were doing the evil nefarious things how I Would use RF IDs so I can't easily track someone without knowing their database, whatever.

692
00:46:32,852 --> 00:46:34,729
Speaker 1: So let's say the databases are secure.

693
00:46:35,652 --> 00:46:44,003
Speaker 1: What if I spend a lot of time around you and I grab RF IDs whenever I can near you And I get my agents to grab them near you.

694
00:46:44,023 --> 00:46:46,357
Speaker 1: I know where you work I know the things you walk by.

695
00:46:46,377 --> 00:46:48,449
Speaker 1: so, you know, I'm already spying on you.

696
00:46:48,952 --> 00:46:52,950
Speaker 1: So I try to gather over a long period of time your RF ID profile.

697
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:54,742
Speaker 1: You tend to wear these brands of clothes.

698
00:46:54,762 --> 00:46:57,074
Speaker 1: you tend to wear these kinds of shoes Most people only hit.

699
00:46:57,094 --> 00:47:04,069
Speaker 1: well most guys who work in the business world only have one or two pairs of shoes at most and they Wear them every day and they don't change them often.

700
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:13,523
Speaker 1: So over time I can build an RF ID profile Whereby I could figure out where you are by having RF ID sensors in key places.

701
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:20,140
Speaker 1: based on the likelihood of well The it's 80% likely that this is rim because it is wearing.

702
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:25,255
Speaker 0: it has 90% match ratio with as you rim shoes and rim Cellphone in the same place.

703
00:47:25,516 --> 00:47:34,602
Speaker 1: Well, I see the brand of shoes rimmed wares and the brand of cell phone rim wears and 70% of these general articles of clothing that he wear matches.

704
00:47:34,662 --> 00:47:40,330
Speaker 1: profile odds are it's rim And that sort of tracking is very interesting.

705
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:47,618
Speaker 1: But I am personally not afraid of that kind of tracking because there are many many non Technological ways to do that kind of tracking.

706
00:47:47,638 --> 00:48:04,630
Speaker 0: and if someone is spending that amount of time tracking you That's the least of your concerns, yeah, I know right and really all the data they can get about you is you where you are Now beyond that the the and if you're going to nefarious places, right?

707
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,070
Speaker 0: Let's say you're going to some embarrassing places like say a strip club, right?

708
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,950
Speaker 0: You know the real interesting and you know, you don't want your wife to know right?

709
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:16,030
Speaker 0: I don't imagine you know strip clubs will be looking at everyone's RF IDs.

710
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:20,130
Speaker 0: They'll probably be in fact blocking, you know, just to be like, ah, we protect you.

711
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:30,130
Speaker 1: Well, it's like the scary porno shop on West Henrietta Road that we don't Right, you know every porn stop has parking in the back where people can hide their cars.

712
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:40,357
Speaker 0: yep, also what you could worry about though is the porn store could are could get all the RF IDs of people coming into their store and then blackmail you.

713
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:42,430
Speaker 1: it's like that Futurama where he's like.

714
00:48:42,932 --> 00:48:45,001
Speaker 1: Respect the privacy of my customers.

715
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:46,186
Speaker 1: Lila's like I'll beat you up.

716
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:47,070
Speaker 1: He's like fine.

717
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,404
Speaker 1: I videotape all my customers and blackmail them later.

718
00:48:49,424 --> 00:48:49,987
Speaker 1: Who do you want to see?

719
00:48:56,152 --> 00:48:57,760
Speaker 1: That's horrible, what do you expect?

720
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:02,388
Speaker 1: I'm some horrible space monster Who runs a porno star?

721
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:08,338
Speaker 1: but the other thing is RFID is RF.

722
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,912
Speaker 1: It is so trivial to block RFID.

723
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know tinfoil a little one of those little, you know, those little baggies.

724
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,096
Speaker 0: They go around your easy pass.

725
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:18,960
Speaker 0: that works.

726
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:21,050
Speaker 1: Not even that the range is not so great.

727
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:23,369
Speaker 0: Well, you can pump up the range with more power.

728
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:29,310
Speaker 1: No But upping the power one makes you more noticeable by people who might not want you to be doing what you're doing.

729
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:31,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, like in the FCC.

730
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:44,190
Speaker 1: Well, no like in a snow crash where that gargoyle guy gets totally fucked by the fact that because he's spying on everyone with his High-powered equipment, he's kind of broadcasting the fact that he's spying on everyone with his high-powered equipment.

731
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:46,890
Speaker 0: And they yeah, it's like, you know, they have a high-powered thing.

732
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:49,462
Speaker 0: You're gonna need like to carry a car bat around you, huh?

733
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:50,789
Speaker 0: Who's that guy with a car?

734
00:49:51,470 --> 00:50:01,869
Speaker 1: Battery and a ghostbuster device just like in silent service, you know sonar Active sonar lets you see the enemy sub But it also tells the enemy sub exactly where you are.

735
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:11,501
Speaker 1: And now you both have a firing solution and only Sean Connery can save the day by going full speed ahead Before the torpedo arms, but yeah passive sonar for the win.

736
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:22,330
Speaker 1: that the thing is it it's difficult because alright So you up the power now, especially as RF IDs get more widespread you get so many responses from all the Hanes t-shirts.

737
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,584
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean like if you're in Times Square and you turn this thing on you don't really.

738
00:50:26,645 --> 00:50:30,822
Speaker 0: you might be able to tell Generally, which direction they came from.

739
00:50:31,344 --> 00:50:32,510
Speaker 0: but you don't you don't really know.

740
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:34,669
Speaker 0: All you know is that they're within range.

741
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,136
Speaker 0: That's all you really know.

742
00:50:36,236 --> 00:50:39,330
Speaker 0: is that this RFID is within range of where I am right now?

743
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:43,244
Speaker 1: Not even that because they respond in the same signal space and because they're the same.

744
00:50:43,304 --> 00:50:45,790
Speaker 1: all the Hanes t-shirts that are gray of the same response.

745
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:47,839
Speaker 1: They overlap they collide.

746
00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:49,850
Speaker 1: you might not even be able to read any of the data.

747
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:51,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, you also might not eat.

748
00:50:51,478 --> 00:50:52,062
Speaker 0: you might know.

749
00:50:52,323 --> 00:50:53,610
Speaker 0: there are Hanes t-shirts.

750
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:58,470
Speaker 0: You don't know how many you know, you could be one it could be a hundred and you just you just get this number back.

751
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:09,120
Speaker 0: Maybe one RFID broadcasted ten times or maybe ten of them broadcasted once you don't know and doing it directionally is Theoretically possible but difficult and of dubious.

752
00:51:09,301 --> 00:51:14,490
Speaker 0: It is much more difficult to get any sort of direction But I think it is theoretically possible with triangulation.

753
00:51:14,651 --> 00:51:29,029
Speaker 1: I think I mean to sum this up in my estimation Scott and I are fairly well versed in technology and the two of us despite being very Protective of certain kinds of privacy and also look at other people are in the know.

754
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:31,689
Speaker 1: None of us are really afraid of RFID.

755
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:35,963
Speaker 0: Well, there are a few situations in which it is a good.

756
00:51:35,983 --> 00:51:38,109
Speaker 0: there are some reasons to be afraid of RFID.

757
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:43,025
Speaker 0: For example, if they were they were talking about putting RFID in US passports, right?

758
00:51:43,346 --> 00:51:45,756
Speaker 1: I just have a Mesh bag.

759
00:51:45,816 --> 00:51:46,520
Speaker 1: I keep it right.

760
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,945
Speaker 0: if you keep it in a little bag with a little you know That filters out RF which is what I would do anyway, which is what you would do.

761
00:51:52,106 --> 00:51:52,548
Speaker 0: You're fine.

762
00:51:52,688 --> 00:51:53,030
Speaker 0: Perfect.

763
00:51:53,431 --> 00:51:59,590
Speaker 0: But if someone's dumb and they don't let's say you're in a place that's not so friendly to the US say Quebec.

764
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:07,189
Speaker 0: All right, you go to Quebec Right and you have your US passport in your pocket But you're pretending to be Canadian because you don't have to be pissed off at you.

765
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,765
Speaker 0: All right, someone's got a little RFID reader and they go haha.

766
00:52:10,946 --> 00:52:11,970
Speaker 0: This is a stupid American.

767
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:14,078
Speaker 0: I will go beat him up now.

768
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,450
Speaker 0: then this is a slight cause for worry.

769
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,020
Speaker 0: But you put your passport in a little protect II thing.

770
00:52:19,462 --> 00:52:19,663
Speaker 0: good.

771
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:20,064
Speaker 0: You're done.

772
00:52:20,185 --> 00:52:20,526
Speaker 0: Whatever.

773
00:52:20,546 --> 00:52:21,390
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't matter.

774
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,821
Speaker 0: now They can have the biggest radio in the world.

775
00:52:22,882 --> 00:52:23,507
Speaker 0: It won't mean shit.

776
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:28,310
Speaker 1: plus I'm not afraid in a more general sense because like people think oh they can track me.

777
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:35,053
Speaker 1: But then if this technology gets widespread enough to where that'll happen RFID will be everywhere It'll be ubiquitous.

778
00:52:35,354 --> 00:52:40,710
Speaker 1: and then the value of tracking you goes down as opposed to the value of trying to track anyone.

779
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:48,330
Speaker 1: It's no different than it's just technology advancing and it's kind of the idea that you really can't expect privacy in public places.

780
00:52:48,691 --> 00:52:55,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially as information becomes, you know so much more easier to collect and transmit more information is gonna be out there.

781
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:59,074
Speaker 1: Just I guess don't do anything Nothing else.

782
00:52:59,455 --> 00:53:08,001
Speaker 1: my opinion if you trust my opinion personally as a as a person who understands technology I am not in the least afraid of RFID technology.

783
00:53:08,142 --> 00:53:17,250
Speaker 1: I welcome its inception and in the future I think we'll do a show on the like billion awesome things we could do if RFID became widespread.

784
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:28,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not afraid of it for myself because in any of the few situations in which it might prove, you know somewhat troubling I know I would be smart I would just you know, I'd put my passport a little baggie and I'd be safe.

785
00:53:28,851 --> 00:53:32,478
Speaker 0: But I do slightly worry for some of the unawares.

786
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:37,790
Speaker 0: less, you know I don't want to say inept more inept peoples or more ignorant.

787
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:47,564
Speaker 1: But at the same time, you know the US like if travelers were going overseas and this is an issue in the future They would issue the standard warning like got to get your malaria shot got to get you whatever.

788
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:56,382
Speaker 1: don't watch out for terrorists and Don't forget to use your handy-dandy Special protect me from the terrorists mesh bag for your passport.

789
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:56,804
Speaker 0: Yep.

790
00:53:57,466 --> 00:53:57,948
Speaker 0: Yeah be fun.

791
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:00,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only thing you really had to.

792
00:54:00,535 --> 00:54:06,670
Speaker 0: the thing about RFID is that because you know RFID sort of has people spooked, right?

793
00:54:07,673 --> 00:54:21,770
Speaker 0: And they sort of come up with all these, you know This and this and this that all the this is and this is that they're worried about are really database, you know Aggregation privacy and security issues, which is actually a separate issue.

794
00:54:22,152 --> 00:54:24,589
Speaker 0: It's just because of the fear of RFID.

795
00:54:25,212 --> 00:54:37,259
Speaker 0: light is being shined on this separate database issue and being attached to RFID and there is some stuff to worry about when you know people with big databases put them together, but Not right now.

796
00:54:37,782 --> 00:54:38,849
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that some other day.

797
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:48,431
