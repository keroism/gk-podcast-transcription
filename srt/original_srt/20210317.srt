1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,266
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, March 17th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:10,667
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:14,387 --> 00:00:14,920
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,222
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:24,281
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about the 1977 anime, Vultus 5.

6
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:25,318
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:35,599
Speaker 0: So a few of you pointed out, and I was aware of this when I switched to having that fancy, completely black background behind me recording Geek Nights on the livestreams.

8
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:40,540
Speaker 0: I was also using that at work to, like, get rid of the background, and it's nice.

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,380
Speaker 0: But you might have noticed, I was a little bit washed out and white.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,220
Speaker 0: The problem I ran into that I had to actually spend some time to figure out and deal with was- Was because it was black, the camera was trying to adjust the exposure?

11
00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:03,160
Speaker 0: Yup, because the camera is a webcam, and it's trying to be clever and not too professional, it tried to do a bunch of too clever crap, and it was a terrible idea.

12
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,618
Speaker 0: But it wasn't just a simple thing of going and like-

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:14,640
Speaker 1: If you're calculating exposure to choose black, I mean, you could also tell the webcam to, you know, if you had a real camera, you could tell it, hey, when you're calculating exposure, just look in this area of the frame.

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,659
Speaker 1: You know, spot, you could do spot metering, center-weighted metering, or you could just do exposure compensation and be like, yeah, minus, you know-

15
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,582
Speaker 0: Yup, basically,

16
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:24,224
Speaker 1: because

17
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:29,161
Speaker 0: this webcam doesn't have, like, the controls on a regular ass, like, professional camera- It should

18
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:31,598
Speaker 1: have, there should be software that comes with it that can let you-.

19
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:37,119
Speaker 0: So that was the thing, I had to install that Logitech software that I've never used in my life.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,900
Speaker 1: Yup, yup, and there's a little slider you can slide.

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:50,260
Speaker 0: Yup, and I slid the slider, and it was amazing, because when I slid the slider by default, it didn't actually change anything, it kept me washed out, but the background got darker.

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:02:01,260
Speaker 0: Like, it did something weird, because it had some automated logic in it, it was trying to prioritize for "exposure," in quotes, instead of doing the thing I would expect a camera to do.

23
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:06,339
Speaker 0: So I had to turn off, like, all the automation and make it all 100% manual, and then I could fix it.

24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:24,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, even the world's most expensive, best cameras that you can buy, right, are only so smart at figuring out, you know, ah, there's a person there, expose for the person and let the background be- Yup.

25
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:32,500
Speaker 1: That is why you need to, no matter what best automate camera you have, you need to understand photography to some extent.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:51,480
Speaker 0: Yup, but there is this weird danger zone on the lowest end of prosumer and the highest end of consumer, where you'll need those kinds of capabilities, but the interface is still simplified and automated in a way that either you can't access that functionality directly, or it tries to abstract it away.

27
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:58,820
Speaker 0: And even if you know about real cameras, you have to figure out what this slider that has weird labels is actually doing before you can-.

28
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:06,220
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, like, if you want to take a photo of, like, you know, the classic example is, like, there's just snow everywhere, so it's frickin' white everywhere, right?

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:18,600
Speaker 1: And if you just take out a camera and just take pictures, no matter, even the world's best camera or an old iPhone, it doesn't matter, it's gonna make the snow look gray, even if your eyeballs tell you the snow is white, just 'cause that's how it works, right?

30
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:21,219
Speaker 0: It's like taking a picture of fire, good luck.

31
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,401
Speaker 1: Right.

32
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:36,860
Speaker 1: On your iPhone, you're gonna have to, you know, there's, like, you can drag up and down in the camera app, the default one at least, to, you know, there's a little picture of a sun, and you can drag it up and down, and you're gonna have to, you know, probably drag it up to fix your snow and make your snow white, right?

33
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:37,839
Speaker 1: Snow white.

34
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,084
Speaker 1: You know, there's nothing you can do about it.

35
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:47,480
Speaker 1: Even the smartest iPhone can't determine that it's, you know, supposed to- it's not actually a gray wall and that it's snow.

36
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:47,760
Speaker 1: Yep.

37
00:03:48,722 --> 00:04:00,720
Speaker 0: So I did sort all that out, and the other problem I was having is that because my microphone arm isn't long enough, because it's the cheapest one, I have to sit really close to my monitor, and the problem is, I have a really fancy monitor.

38
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:08,851
Speaker 0: So the other thing that was messing this up is, if I have a white tab open in front of my face, it's like a spotlight.

39
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:11,835
Speaker 0: Like, it's so bright.

40
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:15,660
Speaker 0: But it was all easily fixed, and now I have a pretty good setup, so now I'm good to go.

41
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:35,600
Speaker 0: I was only mildly annoyed that I had to actually install the software, because I generally have this- I know you do this to a degree, but if I buy like a Logitech mouse, or like anything fancy, like a fancy keyboard, and it has some software that you need to use to configure it or set it up, I try to avoid installing that software to my detriment and at all costs.

42
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:43,000
Speaker 1: I do try to avoid installing that software, but more recently, I have had to basically relent, for example.

43
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,441
Speaker 0: Yep.

44
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:44,011
Speaker 0: Between the 8-bit dose.

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:53,600
Speaker 1: My mouse has LEDs in it, and I need the software to change the color or to disable the LEDs in the mouse.

46
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:56,371
Speaker 0: Once I install the software, guess what I could do?

47
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,860
Speaker 0: I could turn off the fucking light on my mouse.

48
00:04:59,501 --> 00:04:59,943
Speaker 1: Right.

49
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:04,580
Speaker 1: The cooler on my CPU, the software for that, that will let me turn off those lights.

50
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,602
Speaker 0: There's two softwares.

51
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:13,160
Speaker 0: There's the NZXT one, if you have NZXT stuff, and there's also the like, uh, Asus Armory that controls like, the lights that are on RAM now.

52
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:14,718
Speaker 1: I don't have that.

53
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,660
Speaker 1: Well, Emily's motherboard has lights on it.

54
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,999
Speaker 1: I only needed the- I only needed the NZXT one.

55
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,900
Speaker 0: The RAM that had lights on it was significantly cheaper than identical RAM with no lights.

56
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:33,120
Speaker 1: I could, uh, my motherboard, if my motherboard has lights, I think they're adjusted in the UAFI directly.

57
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,619
Speaker 1: I don't think I have to install Windows software to deal with that.

58
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,040
Speaker 1: Yeah.

59
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:40,840
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's life.

60
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,380
Speaker 0: So yeah, in the news, there's actually a lot to talk about today, so we might give a few of these things a short shrift.

61
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:53,180
Speaker 0: But first off, Wolfwalkers, if you're not aware, like we reviewed it, it is one of the better animated films ever made.

62
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,209
Speaker 0: Like, it is a phenomenal film.

63
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:57,640
Speaker 0: It's one of the best animated films I've seen in recent memory.

64
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:04,259
Speaker 0: And of course, it got nominated for a bunch of Oscars, well, a bunch of Annie's, and it got nominated- You know, it's not Akira, but it's up there.

65
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:12,420
Speaker 0: But, uh, I hate to say this, on one hand, it is significant that it was nominated for Best Animated Feature, as it should have been.

66
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:21,160
Speaker 0: But I am confident it will not win it, and that regardless of the relative merits of these two films, I'm pretty sure Soul's gonna get it because it's Disney.

67
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,158
Speaker 0: Regardless.

68
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:27,660
Speaker 1: Because the way the stupid Academy Awards work is they let you vote on things you haven't seen, right?

69
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,360
Speaker 1: And it's just mostly old white guys voting, you know, people who are members of the Academy voting, right?

70
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:44,960
Speaker 0: I'll never forget when Song of the Sea was nominated, and then Big Hero 6, which, not saying Big Hero 6 is a bad movie, but it isn't even in the same, like, remote tier of what Song of the Sea was.

71
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:46,700
Speaker 1: No, not even close.

72
00:06:46,920 --> 00:07:00,899
Speaker 0: And when that one unnamed Academy member said the words that they didn't vote for the Chinese movie, and they voted for the Disney Pixar, whatever, whatever Disney Pixar thing comes out is what a lot of these Academy members vote for without even watching them.

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,191
Speaker 1: Yeah, and not even what the nomination process is, right?

74
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:07,960
Speaker 1: And it's, like, not shitting on Shaun of the Sheep.

75
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's probably a fine movie.

76
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,872
Speaker 1: The people who worked on that probably worked very hard and probably made something.

77
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,260
Speaker 1: I've obviously never seen it and probably won't ever see it.

78
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,738
Speaker 0: But I doubt I would watch it and say, "Wow, that blows Wolfwalkers out of the

79
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:20,019
Speaker 0: water.".

80
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,920
Speaker 1: Right, I'm sure children would watch it and enjoy it, and it's probably, you know, very well done and such, but is it Oscar-worthy?

81
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:38,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, because whatever the Oscar ostensibly is, do experts agree that of all the films in this category in this whole year, this one was the best of them?

82
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,596
Speaker 0: There might be a year where all the movies are shit, and best feature is a garbage movie.

83
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:43,560
Speaker 0: Like, that could happen.

84
00:07:44,181 --> 00:08:08,480
Speaker 1: But, right, ideally speaking, if you made good awards and not shitty ones, and you were going to use the same sort of nomination and then award process, because there are other processes you could use that look nothing like that, but that's, you know, the process that most of these awards have come to, you should look at every category and basically, like, every single nomination should be a hard choice, right?

85
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,174
Speaker 1: And if something obviously, like, is like, "No, no way that could win,".

86
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:15,160
Speaker 1: why is it, it shouldn't even be nominated?

87
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,371
Speaker 1: I think they have a thing where, like, they have to nominate, like, a certain number.

88
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:20,880
Speaker 1: Like, you know, it's always five, I think, right?

89
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,513
Speaker 1: It already seems like it's five, at least.

90
00:08:22,614 --> 00:08:23,260
Speaker 1: I'm probably wrong.

91
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:36,008
Speaker 1: But it's like, you should, it shouldn't, if you're going to use a nominate and then award process, if there are only, like, two things that, like, could win, you should only give out two nominations, right?

92
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,837
Speaker 1: You shouldn't be like, "Well, we have to nominate five just because arbitrary

93
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:40,139
Speaker 1: number.".

94
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:47,420
Speaker 1: Well, I could argue that- If there are ten things and it's a tough choice between all ten, you should have ten nominations, right?

95
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,354
Speaker 0: Well, the other thing, I think we even talked about this at Geek Nights.

96
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:50,160
Speaker 0: that would be interesting.

97
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:56,040
Speaker 0: One, you gotta find a way to make the Academy Awards, at least, like, force these people to watch the movies.

98
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:06,700
Speaker 0: Like, they should all have to take a test, like, at some point to prove that they saw the movie, and if they fail that test on any movie that they had a say in the vote for, all their votes get discounted.

99
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:11,008
Speaker 1: I think they should just do it- Like, name one character from Wolfwalkers.

100
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:13,580
Speaker 0: If you can't do that, your animated feature vote doesn't count.

101
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:17,566
Speaker 1: I think it should just be done, you know, if I was in control, right?

102
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:26,780
Speaker 1: What I would do is I would get together, right, this audience, right, of a diverse audience representing, like, the general populace.

103
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,340
Speaker 1: People who know about movies, people who don't, people of all sorts of colors, shapes, sizes, ages, right?

104
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,060
Speaker 0: Like, nominate the Academy every year.

105
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:37,056
Speaker 1: And I would pay them money, right?

106
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:37,639
Speaker 1: You get paid.

107
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,539
Speaker 1: 'Cause we're gonna make you watch a lot of movies, that's time, you should get money for that, right?

108
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:46,840
Speaker 1: And the Oscars bring in a ton of money, so they have money to pay these people, right?

109
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:52,700
Speaker 1: And what you should do is you should randomly assign the people to a category, right?

110
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,460
Speaker 1: So, you might randomly get assigned to a category you're familiar with, or one you're unfamiliar with.

111
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,320
Speaker 1: You should get a nice mix of people who are familiar and unfamiliar.

112
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:10,860
Speaker 1: And then, you sit the people down, and we can go by something, we can't make them watch, say, for example, in a category, every animated feature film from the whole year.

113
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,980
Speaker 1: That would be impossible, right?

114
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:18,940
Speaker 1: But we can obviously pick based on some other factor, like maybe gross, right?

115
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:24,560
Speaker 1: The top ten grossing ones to even qualify to get watched or something from anywhere in the world, right, you know?

116
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:39,239
Speaker 1: And then, we would say, "Okay, you're gonna have to sit here over the course of two, three days, maybe, and watch all these movies, and you're just gonna fill out little survey cards after each movie, and then at the end, a final survey

117
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:39,539
Speaker 1: card.".

118
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:44,800
Speaker 1: And that will, you know, will then use that to determine who won.

119
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,499
Speaker 1: And that's, you know, something like that.

120
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:55,698
Speaker 0: But I guess, Wolfwalkers honestly, like for real, deserves this Oscar, and I am so confident that Soul's gonna get it instead, even though, like, I watched Soul.

121
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,660
Speaker 0: It's a fantastic movie.

122
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:11,820
Speaker 1: I don't think that, I mean, I also agree that the probability is in Soul's favor, knowing how the Oscars work, but I am not giving Wolfwalkers a 0% chance, because there is Apple money behind it, right?

123
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:13,430
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, that is true.

124
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not 0%.

125
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,538
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it's, you know, it's not 0%, but I'm saying it's less than...

126
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,540
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, I am in a pessimistic mood.

127
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,628
Speaker 1: I'm thinking like 80/20, 80/20 for Soul?

128
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,500
Speaker 0: Just because of the fact that the exact same thing happened with Tom Moore's previous movie?

129
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,761
Speaker 1: Of course.

130
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:31,365
Speaker 1: Alright, so, other anime news.

131
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:39,600
Speaker 1: If you don't know, Discotek has been saving the US anime world for the past however long they've been doing it.

132
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:48,220
Speaker 1: And they love, lately, what they've been doing is sort of, you know, Apple-esque sort of keynotes where, you know, they're not at a convention.

133
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,220
Speaker 1: They're just dropping, like, big piles of licensed news all at once, right, in these tweet threads.

134
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,960
Speaker 1: And the last time they did one, we reported it on the news, and we're doing it again.

135
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,670
Speaker 1: So, good marketing job, Discotek.

136
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,200
Speaker 1: So, what did Discotek drop on us this time?

137
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,820
Speaker 1: Number one, they licensed brother, dear brother, they're gonna make boullés.

138
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:13,071
Speaker 0: You don't have to like this show, but this show is very important.

139
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:16,480
Speaker 0: This is one of those shows, I think we've reviewed it on Geek Nights in an ancient time.

140
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,180
Speaker 1: The manga for brother, dear brother is made by the same person who made the manga for Rosa Versailles.

141
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:33,140
Speaker 1: It's legendary in many ways, it is not up everyone's alley, but, you know, if you're a Rosa Versailles liker like I am, you know, it's like I've known about brother, dear brother.

142
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:35,120
Speaker 0: I watched it all.

143
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,580
Speaker 1: And I've always kinda wanted to see the deal, but I never did, but maybe now's the chance, maybe, you know, it's 'cause it's coming.

144
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:43,880
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna buy boullés, obviously.

145
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,800
Speaker 0: It's one of those shows where you may like it, may not like it, just like Evangelion.

146
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:58,580
Speaker 0: I respect that some people, like, people don't necessarily like Evangelion, but it is important to anime and animation in ways that unless you see it, you might not realize.

147
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,460
Speaker 0: Brother, dear brother inspired a lot of anime that came long after, and the echoes of this show still reverberate today.

148
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:17,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, they said that the license period is unusually short, so that means that they're basically gonna release boullés and then their license might expire pretty much immediately.

149
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,960
Speaker 1: So you have to buy those, you know, I wouldn't buy boullés, but you're gonna have to jump on this while you can, right?

150
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:32,360
Speaker 1: Other news, a show that doesn't seem old but actually is ancient and also legendary, Sergeant Frog, they licensed that.

151
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:44,700
Speaker 1: They're gonna release all 358 episodes in successive SD boullés, 'cause you can fit a lot of episodes on an SD boullé, and the show wasn't in HD to begin with.

152
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,487
Speaker 1: That is 2.7 Sailor Moons.

153
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:48,801
Speaker 1: Right?

154
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:54,253
Speaker 1: So, Sergeant Frog is just, you know, a legendary kids parody comedy show.

155
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:57,660
Speaker 1: You know, it's been around a super long time.

156
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,008
Speaker 0: I've seen, like, a smattering of random episodes.

157
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,040
Speaker 0: It's funny, it's not something I would necessarily seek out and watch all of.

158
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,171
Speaker 1: But I think it's just a significant show, whether you care about it or not, right?

159
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:10,399
Speaker 1: So to release all of it in English is something.

160
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,320
Speaker 0: It's funny, you know, one thing that is significant to that show in terms of, like, anime fandom, especially in America, but also in Japan, is that the closers were notable for having dances that people would emulate.

161
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:26,858
Speaker 1: Some other small shows, they got Kashimashi something, I don't know what that is.

162
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:33,774
Speaker 1: They're releasing Nyanbo, which is basically a cat version of Cardbo, Cardbo from Yotsuba, right?

163
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:36,280
Speaker 1: It has this, like, a little CG anime, Nyanbo.

164
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:38,639
Speaker 0: Oh, Magical Girl Ore.

165
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:41,512
Speaker 1: Magical Ore, right?

166
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:42,780
Speaker 1: Some other stuff, right?

167
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:58,800
Speaker 1: The big news, which we talked about last time, how they couldn't find the original masters for Project Eiko, so they were using, like, this magical restoring device that would basically, you know, do the best job it could with the best laser disc sources they had available.

168
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:15,339
Speaker 1: What happened is Robert Woodhead, if you don't know Robert Woodhead, Robert Woodhead is a legend in the US anime industry, created Anime Ego, which I'm pretty sure is gone now, but Anime Ego was basically making the best legal anime releases back in the 2000s, 90s even, right?

169
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,019
Speaker 1: Very legendary, important person.

170
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,772
Speaker 1: Robert Woodhead went to some film vault somewhere, and apparently there was just, like, the way it was organized.

171
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:31,760
Speaker 1: there, like, the catalog or something was messed up, I don't know, a misspelling or a miscategorization?

172
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:41,640
Speaker 1: And Robert Woodhead knew how to find the Project Eiko masters that were definitely in that vault and were just, you know, not labeled or placed properly for some reason.

173
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:53,840
Speaker 0: Which means the Project Eiko re-release will now be from the original 35mm print instead of that very clever previous solution, which was pulling the raw data off of the laser discs and doing the best they could.

174
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,560
Speaker 1: Yep, so we're looking forward to this Project Eiko release here.

175
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,960
Speaker 0: Project Eiko was the third anime I ever saw.

176
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:04,780
Speaker 1: Maybe when it comes out, Geek Night's Time.

177
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,206
Speaker 0: I think it still holds up.

178
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:08,980
Speaker 0: I have not seen it in, like, a decade, I'm pretty sure.

179
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,260
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it in forever.

180
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:14,300
Speaker 0: I am confident it will be just as funny to me now as it was when I was in fourth grade.

181
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,679
Speaker 1: We need Eiko to go outside and find whoever's car alarm keeps going off.

182
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,260
Speaker 1: Of course, Eiko could just probably throw the car into the river and then we'd be fine, right?

183
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,020
Speaker 0: The fact that as a kid I didn't get that it was a comedy and I kind of just treated it as a superhero movie.

184
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:29,240
Speaker 1: Hmm.

185
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:31,739
Speaker 1: Alright, other news.

186
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,460
Speaker 1: So, everybody knows about, you know, you think about, like, legendary anime, you know, directors.

187
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,878
Speaker 1: We got our Satoshi Kans, you got your Miyazakis, obviously, right?

188
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,540
Speaker 1: All those people.

189
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:49,860
Speaker 1: There was a person that is not often mentioned, right, who was named Yasuo Otsuka.

190
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,440
Speaker 1: And Yasuo Otsuka wasn't, like, a director, it was like an animation director, right?

191
00:16:55,062 --> 00:17:00,060
Speaker 1: But Yasuo Otsuka was sort of like even the before times, right?

192
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,000
Speaker 1: You know, he was like, you know, the mentor to the Miyazakis and the Isao Takahata's of the world, right?

193
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:13,200
Speaker 0: He joined Toei when it had a different name in 1956.

194
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,619
Speaker 1: Right, so he was like, you know, he gets to Toei and it's like, you know, Miyazaki's working on Horace, Prince of Sun.

195
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,440
Speaker 1: And it's like a young guy when Otsuka is already the old guy there, right?

196
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:29,840
Speaker 1: He worked on a lot of Lupin movies, you know, Future Boy Conan, right?

197
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,380
Speaker 1: All these, like, super old, you know, much older anime and then retired at some point.

198
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,070
Speaker 1: But yeah, the news is that he passed away at the age of 89.

199
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,280
Speaker 1: I'll take 89.

200
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,804
Speaker 1: I can't complain about that.

201
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:53,620
Speaker 1: But still a sad news, you know, such a legendary figure in the anime industry who does not get the deserved attention, right?

202
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:01,059
Speaker 1: Not being a, you know, primary director of super popular things that people know about today, right?

203
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:03,540
Speaker 1: But super important.

204
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:11,500
Speaker 1: The same way that, like, you know, Ip Man, who supposedly taught Bruce Lee, right, didn't get the attention, right?

205
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,579
Speaker 1: Bruce Lee got all the attention until more recently.

206
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,019
Speaker 1: People are like, oh, Ip Man, because someone made a good Ip Man movie, right?

207
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:18,739
Speaker 1: This is sort of that kind of deal.

208
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:26,940
Speaker 0: So instead of news, I've actually got three Geek Bytes because I've been watching a lot of animation lately, and there's a lot of really good stuff out there.

209
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:31,559
Speaker 0: I'll go brief on these because I'm pretty sure we'll review all three of these on Geek Nights at some point.

210
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,600
Speaker 0: But first, I know I mentioned this, I've seen an entire arc now of The Great Pretender, a recent anime.

211
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:39,680
Speaker 1: It's on the Netflix.

212
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:40,439
Speaker 0: It's on the Netflix.

213
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:44,540
Speaker 0: It's got Cowboy Bebop vibes, like, for real.

214
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:51,160
Speaker 1: The live-action Cowboy Bebop from Netflix has finished filming, supposedly, for a season.

215
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,740
Speaker 0: It's also got some big Lupin vibes.

216
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,140
Speaker 0: And what I'll say about it is that it is one of the better anime I've seen in a long time.

217
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:04,760
Speaker 0: You know that feeling when you're watching a show and you kind of like it, you watch a few episodes, you pause, maybe finish it later.

218
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,520
Speaker 0: But you know when you watch a show and an episode ends and all you think is, I just want to watch the next episode.

219
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:12,720
Speaker 0: This show is that.

220
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:22,240
Speaker 0: This is the kind of show where if we were still running RIT anime, we would have shown the first four episodes and would have probably done the marathon the following weekend.

221
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:29,560
Speaker 1: If we were running an anime club, though, today, how would it work getting Netflix permissions to screen things?

222
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,346
Speaker 0: You know what we should do?

223
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:31,940
Speaker 0: We should ask the RIT anime club.

224
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,047
Speaker 0: I got a lot of contacts there.

225
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:33,893
Speaker 0: Let's see how they do it.

226
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:34,719
Speaker 0: I'm curious what they do.

227
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm curious what the deal is now.

228
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,180
Speaker 0: I mean, we definitely flew fast and loose.

229
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:47,600
Speaker 0: One of our favorite techniques was to send a letter to the anime studio or the company that had the rights who we knew would probably say no.

230
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,794
Speaker 0: And we'd basically say, "Hey, we're going to show this on this date in our club.

231
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:52,778
Speaker 0: Let us know if that's not

232
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:53,120
Speaker 0: cool.".

233
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,138
Speaker 0: And either they wouldn't respond or the letter would come after we had already shown it.

234
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're not going to, you know, you're basically betting.

235
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,200
Speaker 1: Like if they came after you with a lawyer, it's like the court would obviously see that you were doing this not in good faith.

236
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:11,233
Speaker 0: Yep, and if the court came after me, I would say, "This is a club and a college.

237
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,377
Speaker 0: I hereby resign from the

238
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:12,638
Speaker 0: club.".

239
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,720
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm not legally responsible for the thing.

240
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, guess what, anime kids?

241
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:23,500
Speaker 0: Now that it's been 20 years, I can spill the sausage on how we actually ran the RIT anime club.

242
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the school is the one who's going to have to pay, not me.

243
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:31,478
Speaker 1: I guess they could academically kick you out of the school, right?

244
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:36,954
Speaker 0: I was just the facilities coordinator.

245
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:38,680
Speaker 0: I had no idea what the librarian was doing.

246
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:48,940
Speaker 0: But The Great Pretender is real good, and it is apparent how good it is from the first episode.

247
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:55,060
Speaker 0: I promise you, if you watch one episode of this, you're probably going to be into it.

248
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,089
Speaker 1: What are they pretending?

249
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:58,708
Speaker 0: They're con men.

250
00:20:58,929 --> 00:20:59,552
Speaker 0: It's The Sting.

251
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:01,320
Speaker 0: This is a con artist show.

252
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:08,994
Speaker 0: The show starts following a small-time con artist in Japan who gets conned himself by a bigger con artist.

253
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,420
Speaker 0: And it just escalates and escalates and escalates.

254
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,740
Speaker 1: And then learns from the master con artist.

255
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:29,699
Speaker 0: This show goes from "I am pretending to be the water inspector to try to trick you into buying a filter," to "breaking bad with even bigger stakes within a couple

256
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:29,880
Speaker 0: episodes.".

257
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,000
Speaker 1: I am pretending to be the Prime Minister and getting away with it.

258
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:43,780
Speaker 0: Episode two, they're running a scam prop plane racing company in Singapore, and it is just going off the charts.

259
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:47,260
Speaker 0: The show is great.

260
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,578
Speaker 1: What else did you watch?

261
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,525
Speaker 0: So we watched a movie, a recent movie.

262
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:53,054
Speaker 0: This is a Chinese animated film from 2019, The Legend of Hei.

263
00:21:57,243 --> 00:22:00,240
Speaker 0: We watched it, I think, with G-Kids and the Children's International Film Festival.

264
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,080
Speaker 0: I don't know how to watch it otherwise, because that's done now.

265
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,426
Speaker 1: There's an official trailer.

266
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:07,860
Speaker 1: That's a nice movie poster with a cute little kitty.

267
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,309
Speaker 0: This movie is about that kitty.

268
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,314
Speaker 0: It is beautiful.

269
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:12,760
Speaker 0: The characters are great.

270
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:14,486
Speaker 0: The dub, good enough.

271
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:18,639
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good dub, because the subtitle version wasn't available, at least when we watched it.

272
00:22:20,102 --> 00:22:21,388
Speaker 0: I highly recommend this movie.

273
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,760
Speaker 0: I think it is specifically up Scott's alley.

274
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:28,014
Speaker 0: I have very little bad to say about this movie.

275
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:29,040
Speaker 0: I enjoyed it to the end.

276
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,824
Speaker 0: The ending was good.

277
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:30,468
Speaker 0: The plot was good.

278
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:31,454
Speaker 0: The characters were great.

279
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:32,440
Speaker 0: It moved quick.

280
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:36,760
Speaker 0: It had a lot of anime tropes that were good, but it also did its own thing.

281
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,120
Speaker 0: It's very clearly a Chinese movie, informed by Chinese sensibilities, Chinese animation.

282
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:47,240
Speaker 0: You should watch it, and I'd like to say a lot more about it that I think we should save for a review.

283
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:49,747
Speaker 0: This is a must-see movie.

284
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,720
Speaker 0: If you like animated movies, there's no reason not to watch this movie.

285
00:22:53,660 --> 00:23:10,780
Speaker 1: It does appear that on the New York International Children's Film Festival.org website, nicff.org, you can still buy and watch movies from the festival this year, because it was online.

286
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:14,797
Speaker 0: I think what expired for us is we bought access to the festival itself.

287
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:15,560
Speaker 0: We watched all the shorts.

288
00:23:16,782 --> 00:23:21,460
Speaker 1: You can get an encore pass for $60, an all-access pass for $100.

289
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,123
Speaker 1: Take your time.

290
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:25,558
Speaker 1: Watch the whole slate whenever you want with an all-access pass valid through March 21st.

291
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:34,319
Speaker 1: So if you buy it for $100, you've got three or four days, basically, depending on where you live and when you hear this, or maybe zero days.

292
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:37,716
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll have to watch The Legend of Hey real soon.

293
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,240
Speaker 0: I think you will specifically like many parts of this movie.

294
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:48,480
Speaker 1: I guess Sunday would be the end, but yeah, it looks like you still have time.

295
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:49,320
Speaker 1: That's the point.

296
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,220
Speaker 0: And third, I watched Raya and the Last Dragon, the new Disney movie.

297
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:56,519
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

298
00:23:57,101 --> 00:24:00,031
Speaker 0: It is, honestly, pretty fantastic.

299
00:24:00,132 --> 00:24:02,340
Speaker 0: There's a lot to recommend this movie.

300
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,820
Speaker 0: I think the things that I would want to say about it are that one, it's got a really cool dragon character design.

301
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,680
Speaker 0: Who is featured prominently.

302
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,080
Speaker 0: Two, mostly female cast, like it's mostly women.

303
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:17,820
Speaker 0: There aren't like main dudes in this movie, which I think is a good step for Disney.

304
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:20,980
Speaker 0: And three, it's just beautiful.

305
00:24:21,722 --> 00:24:24,516
Speaker 0: I want to watch this on the big screen once.

306
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:31,100
Speaker 0: that's safe to do, because I don't think our little shitty 1080p failing television really did this movie justice.

307
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:42,120
Speaker 1: It is actually sort of eh, because the TV we have, the 1080p TV we have, it's 50 something, maybe it's 50 inch, I guess, I don't know.

308
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,112
Speaker 1: But it's plenty good, right?

309
00:24:44,152 --> 00:24:45,300
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with it.

310
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:48,800
Speaker 0: Not like mine that is actually failing bit by bit.

311
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:55,220
Speaker 1: But I bought a 4K monitor, so 4K content is still quite rare.

312
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:03,478
Speaker 1: But occasionally, there's like a YouTube video that's 4K, and it's like, wow, is it nice to watch it in 4K.

313
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:13,480
Speaker 0: I got these 4K monitors a while ago, and you came over, and you saw how long ago this was, and I had Auto Chess open before Geek Nights, because I was finishing a match.

314
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,720
Speaker 1: Why does your Auto Chess look so good?

315
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, you were like, and I was like, Scott, it's 4K.

316
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:31,260
Speaker 1: But it's like, yeah, I'm still not going to get a 4K TV, though, until that one breaks, or until lots and lots of content is 4K, and not just the occasional YouTube video, or Netflix.

317
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:39,313
Speaker 0: But this movie is good, I like this movie a lot, not just because, if you know me at all, you know how into dragons I am, but I like that.

318
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:45,340
Speaker 0: dragons featured prominently, and didn't just die at the end of the movie, like usually happens with dragon stuff.

319
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:55,519
Speaker 0: But the ending is good, and I like what they did with it, and I'm being obtuse on purpose, because obviously, let's go see this movie, I'm not going to spoil it for you.

320
00:25:56,661 --> 00:26:11,080
Speaker 0: But the other thing I'll say about it is that I saw a lot of people online complaining that the dragon was too cutesy, too feminine, or too My Little Pony looking, and I would say that the dragon character design is what makes this movie great instead of just good.

321
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:15,379
Speaker 0: This is a My Little Pony looking character design, and I am here for this.

322
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,459
Speaker 1: Anyone who makes that kind of complaint is just telling it on themselves.

323
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,980
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep, those are the literal words I was about to say, and you preempted me.

324
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:28,520
Speaker 1: Come on, let me know what kind of person you are once you say something like that.

325
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:49,920
Speaker 0: Yep, but the last thing I'll say is that the character, the dragon, when she comes onto the scene, like appears in the movie, you know that archetype character like Eda in The Owl House, or Ryoko in Tenchi Muyo, like someone who is ancient and powerful, and she's kind of dangerous, but she's also kind of a disaster and a fuck-up.

326
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,660
Speaker 0: Like, that archetype of character is one of my favorite tropes, and the dragon in this movie is that.

327
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,160
Speaker 0: The dragon is kind of like the fuck-up dragon, and it's good.

328
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,960
Speaker 1: How would it be if you made a story where there's like four of those characters?

329
00:27:07,082 --> 00:27:07,913
Speaker 0: That's Tenchi Muyo.

330
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:10,485
Speaker 1: Is it?

331
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,299
Speaker 1: I thought there's only a couple, anyway.

332
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,340
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess Owl House, there's only one, like Eda, like it's the character who is that, and everyone else around her.

333
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,689
Speaker 1: I guess El Hazzard, aren't there.

334
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:19,837
Speaker 1: like the several...

335
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,840
Speaker 0: You know what, the three priestesses are all kind of like that.

336
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,496
Speaker 1: That's right, the three priestesses in El Hazzard, but there's sort of like one character?

337
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:27,280
Speaker 1: I don't know, anyway.

338
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,939
Speaker 0: Also, the teacher, it's not like the female version, but he's the male equivalent of that.

339
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,925
Speaker 0: What does that say?

340
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:39,240
Speaker 0: He's like the late 30s kind of a fuck-up, but actually does the right thing.

341
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:47,800
Speaker 0: Out of that whole space of flawed disaster characters who do the right thing in the end, but are actually kind of evil sometimes, too.

342
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,420
Speaker 0: There's something going on that I like about that kind of character.

343
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,059
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

344
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,510
Speaker 0: Scott called dibs on this thing of the day, so I'll let him go second.

345
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:02,664
Speaker 0: I did.

346
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:07,450
Speaker 0: I was hoping he'd forget, like I had it open in a tab, because it's so good.

347
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:14,239
Speaker 0: So I had to bring the most powerful thing I could bring, and the best I got is... You know the game Among Us?

348
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:15,470
Speaker 0: There's an imposter.

349
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:17,090
Speaker 1: It's pretty popular.

350
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,888
Speaker 0: Go Google, I'm not going to explain what Among Us is.

351
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:25,950
Speaker 0: Another channel I've done before, TwoSet Violin, those two cool violin dudes who talk about violins and like violin playing.

352
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,237
Speaker 0: They did a video.

353
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:30,750
Speaker 0: This is so perfect.

354
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:38,050
Speaker 0: They made their own version of Among Us that can only be played by classical string musicians.

355
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,661
Speaker 0: They got a bunch of musicians together.

356
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:42,009
Speaker 0: They're going to play a piece.

357
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,148
Speaker 0: Four of the people in this group, or two depends, like they have a bunch of different modes.

358
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:54,750
Speaker 0: they tried, have the same sheet music, except there are specific sections in red that are wrong.

359
00:28:55,453 --> 00:28:59,150
Speaker 0: They have to play the wrong parts and not get caught.

360
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,315
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.

361
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,968
Speaker 0: But everyone else can be like, "Nope, I'm calling a meeting.

362
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,835
Speaker 0: I heard Joey Jojo.

363
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:07,959
Speaker 0: I think they played a flat...".

364
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,359
Speaker 1: But maybe you just fucked up.

365
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:16,440
Speaker 0: If you just fuck up, think about it, Among Us, if you just fuck up, you're going to get voted off the island anyway.

366
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,802
Speaker 1: Exactly.

367
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:21,380
Speaker 1: So if you get to the end of the piece and there are still imposters alive, then they win?

368
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:23,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this video is 30 minutes long.

369
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,400
Speaker 0: They made up good rules.

370
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:27,825
Speaker 0: Watch the video to see.

371
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:33,680
Speaker 0: They made the rules sufficient to make this work for real, and that is legitimately impressive.

372
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:40,619
Speaker 0: Most of the time when someone says, "Oh, let's make Among Us but fa, like fubar, like make my own rules, it's always

373
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:41,040
Speaker 0: garbage."

374
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:41,964
Speaker 0: Or, "It's just a

375
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:42,286
Speaker 0: joke.".

376
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:45,280
Speaker 0: They did this for real, and I'm very impressed by that.

377
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:47,347
Speaker 1: It sounds fun.

378
00:29:47,447 --> 00:29:49,780
Speaker 1: Something for musicians to do because they can't hold any concerts.

379
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,891
Speaker 1: Did you know that Met Opera laid a bunch of people off?

380
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,597
Speaker 1: I think some large percentage, I heard as high as 40% of people just left New York City, 10% retired.

381
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:06,740
Speaker 1: They're basically threatening if they come back to negotiate.

382
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:11,460
Speaker 1: I think I was reading, if they come back to negotiate, they're going to offer them partial money.

383
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:14,299
Speaker 1: They don't even want to go back because then they'll have a shit deal.

384
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,640
Speaker 1: It's like they're better off just holding out.

385
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,992
Speaker 0: The New Republic Library, this is a total aside, they have a kit.

386
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:23,040
Speaker 0: If you have a library card, you can just go get it.

387
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:24,526
Speaker 0: Anyone in New York can get this.

388
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:40,660
Speaker 0: The kit is if you are a performer or musician of some kind, and you need hardware to be able to stream yourself and create from your house, they'll give you a fancy keyboard, a bunch of recording equipment, lights, cameras, everything in a kit.

389
00:30:41,082 --> 00:30:44,860
Speaker 1: What does that have to do with the people at the Met Opera being screwed out of money?

390
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:54,000
Speaker 0: Because the rationale for this kit is that a lot of creators in New York City have left New York City or otherwise can't create.

391
00:30:55,762 --> 00:31:07,040
Speaker 0: There's a situation around New York's going to be struggling to find even backup musicians or studio musicians, people to fill in all the creative gaps that currently were previously filled.

392
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,704
Speaker 1: I think that's an incentive to stay.

393
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:20,620
Speaker 1: If you can hold out through the end and people don't come back so quickly, you can then demand higher wages at the point where it's like, "Who else are you going to

394
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:20,700
Speaker 1: get?".

395
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,859
Speaker 1: All the other people who play this instrument have left town.

396
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,648
Speaker 1: Who are you going to find to play an oboe in five minutes?

397
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:26,813
Speaker 1: It's me.

398
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:28,620
Speaker 1: I'm the only oboe in town now.

399
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:38,880
Speaker 0: Currently, the whole reason a lot of things are in New York is because you can literally say, "I need extremely long, detailed set of skills," and there are like 10 people who can do that for you.

400
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:47,277
Speaker 1: I need someone who can play an oboe at a master level and weighs less than this amount because the stage is shoddy.

401
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,580
Speaker 0: Suspended from the sky, and they have to be able to play DDR because we're making a movie.

402
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they have to speak this language, and they have to learn this piece or already know it.

403
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:00,829
Speaker 1: It's like, "Okay, we found two candidates.

404
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:01,332
Speaker 1: You want to do whole

405
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:01,794
Speaker 1: auditions?".

406
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,020
Speaker 0: So you got a thing of the day?

407
00:32:07,981 --> 00:32:08,343
Speaker 1: Oh, I do.

408
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:08,786
Speaker 1: I forgot.

409
00:32:08,806 --> 00:32:10,900
Speaker 1: I was going meta moment land there.

410
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:18,679
Speaker 1: This thing of the day, it's from that website, The Hard Times, which is basically the onion of video game nerdery.

411
00:32:20,843 --> 00:32:22,599
Speaker 1: I think we've used it for things of the day before.

412
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:31,760
Speaker 1: But this particular article is that case where parody approaches reality, but you can't tell the difference between parody and reality.

413
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,203
Speaker 1: It's usually a bad thing.

414
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:39,796
Speaker 1: Someone's making a satirical parody about something awful in the world, and it's like, "No, actually, that's real,".

415
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:41,880
Speaker 1: and you'll get not the onion.

416
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,395
Speaker 0: Or the joke is just the headline, and the article isn't actually funny.

417
00:32:47,456 --> 00:32:48,640
Speaker 0: It's just to support the joke.

418
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:55,740
Speaker 1: Right, so this article here, a parody article, supposedly, is about one of my favorite scenes in anime.

419
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:10,380
Speaker 1: It's actually a scene that happens in many anime, the scene where they're just showing an empty street or terrain in Japan somewhere, usually including homes, trees, power lines, very frequent.

420
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:15,480
Speaker 1: And you're hearing the noises of the cicadas as they sound in Japan.

421
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:24,020
Speaker 1: If you're watching an anime, what this scene is supposed to tell you is A, we're filling up time in the episode.

422
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:29,780
Speaker 1: B, we're pacing the episode with some environmental storytelling.

423
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:33,069
Speaker 1: And C, it's summer and it's hot.

424
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:36,059
Speaker 1: We're letting you know what the weather is and the time of year is.

425
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:50,200
Speaker 1: The only one I've seen where it has even further meanings are in Lain, because the power lines in Lain have an additional meaning, and those are a bigger focus in the visual aspect of the scene.

426
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:58,220
Speaker 1: And in Evangelion, because in Evangelion, I don't know how many people watch Evangelion and don't realize this, it's always summer.

427
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:00,864
Speaker 1: Winter has been destroyed.

428
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:02,889
Speaker 1: No one's having any babies.

429
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,299
Speaker 1: It's a semi-apocalyptic situation that they are stuck in.

430
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,105
Speaker 1: No humans are being born.

431
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:11,935
Speaker 1: It's super hot everywhere on Earth.

432
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:13,159
Speaker 1: Is there even precipitation?

433
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,560
Speaker 0: The end of summer is an endless summer, and there is nothing coming after that.

434
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:25,935
Speaker 1: Right, so that's why there's always cicadas in Evangelion, reminding you it's still hot.

435
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:28,460
Speaker 1: The hotness has not stopped.

436
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:34,755
Speaker 1: And then the scenes of characters wiping sweat off all the time because it's so hot out and drinking beers.

437
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:35,859
Speaker 1: It's hot.

438
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:36,239
Speaker 1: Anyway.

439
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,388
Speaker 1: So here, the article that they made is what?

440
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:44,040
Speaker 1: Top 10 power lines and cicada noises?

441
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,580
Speaker 0: Static shots of power lines with cicada noises.

442
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,748
Speaker 1: Right, so it's like, for them, they're like, "Ah, it's a joke.

443
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,933
Speaker 1: Lots of anime have this

444
00:34:52,973 --> 00:34:53,254
Speaker 1: scene.".

445
00:34:53,313 --> 00:34:55,260
Speaker 1: But for me, it's like, sincere.

446
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,083
Speaker 1: It's like, I love those.

447
00:34:57,545 --> 00:35:00,313
Speaker 1: I love static shots of power lines and cicada noises.

448
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:02,840
Speaker 1: Those are a good, somewhat good top 10.

449
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,719
Speaker 0: I have very little disagreement with this list.

450
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:08,039
Speaker 1: There's a few of the shows I've never heard of.

451
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,947
Speaker 0: But the commentary is real.

452
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:13,039
Speaker 0: Like, there's a real commentary on each one of these.

453
00:35:13,621 --> 00:35:16,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, you read an Onion article.

454
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:18,172
Speaker 1: Usually, not the Onion article.

455
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:20,738
Speaker 1: It's like, you're reading a true story and you're like, "This should be on the

456
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:21,059
Speaker 1: Onion.".

457
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,205
Speaker 1: This is, I'm reading something on an Onion equivalent.

458
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:28,171
Speaker 1: They're writing it as a joke, but I take it completely at face value.

459
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,414
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Yeah.

460
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,137
Speaker 1: Power lines and cicada noises.

461
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:31,798
Speaker 1: That's my jam.

462
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:32,339
Speaker 1: Pick me

463
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:32,519
Speaker 1: up.".

464
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,175
Speaker 0: Now to see a top 10 "I haven't yet shown you my full

465
00:35:36,215 --> 00:35:36,517
Speaker 0: power.".

466
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:39,438
Speaker 1: I would agree with that also.

467
00:35:41,963 --> 00:35:43,512
Speaker 1: I love "I haven't yet shown you my full

468
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:43,793
Speaker 1: power.".

469
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,348
Speaker 0: In the meantime, we can't go anywhere, but our panels can.

470
00:35:48,428 --> 00:36:02,880
Speaker 0: So if you missed the Judge Anime by its Cover panel that we did for the Crunchyroll Expo, well, basically because we couldn't redistribute that on our YouTube channel, almost the exact same panel is going to be at Zenk icon online this weekend.

471
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:05,380
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.

472
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:13,340
Speaker 0: Because it's basically, we did 45 minutes of talking about how to judge anime by its cover, and then we only actually talked about shows in the very end.

473
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,279
Speaker 0: And I went back and actually looked at how we judged those shows.

474
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,150
Speaker 0: Gibiade wasn't as good as we hoped it would be.

475
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:22,459
Speaker 0: But otherwise, we were pretty spot on as far as I could see.

476
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:35,780
Speaker 1: Otherwise... Oh, so the Book Club book after a year plus, who knows how long, is still The Tale of Genji, the first novel ever written by humans.

477
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:38,280
Speaker 1: And the human who wrote it is Murasaki Shikibu.

478
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:46,500
Speaker 1: I read a significant portion of the next chapter that I was reading last night where progress is being made.

479
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:52,500
Speaker 0: I did not read more since we did a show on Monday, but I'm continuing at a steady pace.

480
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,875
Speaker 1: I am getting close to 10% complete.

481
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:58,115
Speaker 0: Alright, maybe 10% is a good point.

482
00:36:59,762 --> 00:37:02,739
Speaker 0: 10-12% is a good point for us to do a little brief chat in the moment.

483
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,658
Speaker 1: Are we going to just do 10 episodes instead of one?

484
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:09,694
Speaker 1: I feel like we can just do one episode when we're done reading 100% like we usually do.

485
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:16,172
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you want to read along with us, you can.

486
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:19,220
Speaker 1: Or, you know, wait and we'll do an episode.

487
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:32,560
Speaker 1: And then, I promise after that, I'm going to at least... I can't help what rim picks for Book Clubs, but I will make a concerted... You know, after this incident of the Book Club that went on too long and a pandemic, right?

488
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,213
Speaker 1: I'm going to basically be like, "Well, a pandemic can happen at any time,

489
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:36,097
Speaker 1: again.".

490
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,580
Speaker 1: So therefore, we're going to do more rapid book clubbing, at least I hope, afterwards.

491
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,280
Speaker 0: The key is I can get outside, I can sit in a park and read a book, and that really accelerates my book reading.

492
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:49,820
Speaker 1: Or a beach, hopefully.

493
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,040
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I just want to lay on a beach all day reading books.

494
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,062
Speaker 1: Yep.

495
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,520
Speaker 1: Well, anyway.

496
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:03,041
Speaker 0: Alright, so, Vultus 5 is an anime from 1977.

497
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:09,920
Speaker 1: So this anime was made, basically, you know, there was a whole bunch of robot shows made back in the day, right?

498
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,060
Speaker 1: And a lot of them were made by the same company.

499
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:19,060
Speaker 1: They would make one, it would end, you know, for the kids, right?

500
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,140
Speaker 1: And then they would come and they'd make another one for the kids again, right?

501
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,000
Speaker 1: So, you know, there was a lot of studios involved.

502
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:33,414
Speaker 1: If you look at Wikipedia, it's like, "Studios, Tohoku Shinsha Nippon Sunrise Toei

503
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:33,835
Speaker 1: Company.".

504
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,320
Speaker 1: It was on TV Asahi, it was the broadcasting company.

505
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,760
Speaker 1: And it's created by Saburo Yatsude.

506
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,739
Speaker 1: Saburo Yatsude is not a person.

507
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:58,715
Speaker 1: It was basically a made-up name that they would put as the creator of several things, indicating that basically the same team of people was basically creating the show, but they didn't actually put an actual creator's name on it.

508
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:03,980
Speaker 1: the way that, you know, Leiji Matsumoto is a real person or Kiyo Hayamezaki is a real person.

509
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:07,340
Speaker 1: And there were several such shows made by the same people.

510
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,900
Speaker 1: The one you're probably most familiar with is Voltron/Beast King Go Lion, right?

511
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,419
Speaker 1: Which we can do a show about someday if we haven't already.

512
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,610
Speaker 1: Voltron came out in 1980, early '80s, right?

513
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,320
Speaker 1: So this preceded Voltron by quite a few years, for four years maybe.

514
00:39:25,302 --> 00:39:37,000
Speaker 1: But you cannot help but compare the two shows because there are so many similarities, but enough differences that are significant and worth discussing, right?

515
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:42,620
Speaker 1: So it's a show, there's 40 episodes, it is made to sell toys to children.

516
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,920
Speaker 0: Yup, Judy, you cannot escape that fact.

517
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:53,239
Speaker 0: In literally every episode, The Volt is Five, it'll form, or if it doesn't form, there's a reason why it didn't form.

518
00:39:53,663 --> 00:39:55,559
Speaker 0: And then it's gonna basically spin tops.

519
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:06,220
Speaker 1: It'll use all of its special attacks, which are advertising the features of the toy, it will use the same special moves, right, or get new special moves.

520
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:13,980
Speaker 1: There's, you know, stock animation sequences of it transforming or doing special attacks that are repeated every episode.

521
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,100
Speaker 1: Sometimes more than once per episode will have to combine.

522
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:32,420
Speaker 1: You know, it's basically showing kids all the different ways they can play with this toy, The Volt is Five, which is five vehicles, right, formed that you can combine into a robot in kind of a not great way.

523
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:39,300
Speaker 1: You know, it's like I think at this point in time, like they probably still weren't great at making the combining toys, right?

524
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:44,700
Speaker 1: This predates like the Transformers Devastator, it predates Voltron obviously, right?

525
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:49,019
Speaker 0: A mask which had the most complex transforming toys.

526
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,200
Speaker 1: It predates Matt Cross Valkyries, right?

527
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:59,220
Speaker 1: So it's the way in which the toy functions and thus the way it appears in the show is very inelegant, right?

528
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,439
Speaker 1: It's like the legs and the waist are just like one big U-shaped boat thing.

529
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,320
Speaker 0: They go to great pains to show you like, "No, this makes sense," when like the cockpit of the main guy will like rotate twice.

530
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:18,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, the feet are like come off and combine into a vehicle and then separate and just stick on the bottom as the two feet.

531
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,320
Speaker 1: Like the ninja girl's job is to pilot the feet.

532
00:41:23,702 --> 00:41:27,120
Speaker 1: The two arms are vehicles and the rest of it is just one vehicle.

533
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,940
Speaker 1: The head and torso is all one vehicle.

534
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:31,360
Speaker 1: So it's not very elegant.

535
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:33,312
Speaker 1: It's kind of cool, right?

536
00:41:34,181 --> 00:41:35,440
Speaker 1: It's called the Volt is Five.

537
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,660
Speaker 1: I think that might have been just some, they tried to use English.

538
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:44,040
Speaker 1: and it's just the Volt's Five, like Volt as in electricity because it's powered by electromagnetism.

539
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,040
Speaker 0: Yup, the translation of the name is Super Electromagnetic Machine, Volt's Five.

540
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,739
Speaker 1: Right, Volt is Five.

541
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,540
Speaker 1: And it's called Volt is Five because it has five pilots just like Voltron.

542
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:58,520
Speaker 1: It even has, slash go lion, this main white dude, right?

543
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,200
Speaker 1: There's big dude.

544
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,900
Speaker 1: There's jerky dude in blue.

545
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:04,420
Speaker 1: It's even the same colors, right?

546
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,720
Speaker 1: Main dude is red.

547
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, little kid, right?

548
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,180
Speaker 1: And there's the lady.

549
00:42:08,044 --> 00:42:11,220
Speaker 1: Little kid is in green and then girl, right?

550
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,701
Speaker 1: It's from 1970.

551
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:19,540
Speaker 1: The sexism and other problems of 1970s Japanese kid show cannot be overlooked.

552
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,178
Speaker 0: They're there.

553
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:22,499
Speaker 1: They are there in full force.

554
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:25,839
Speaker 1: And that's what the show is.

555
00:42:26,364 --> 00:42:28,040
Speaker 1: It's monster of the week, right?

556
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,260
Speaker 1: How do they, they form a team to fight an alien invading force that sends evil beast knights, right?

557
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,040
Speaker 1: In Voltron, it was Robeasts, I guess, that came in those awesome coffins that would land.

558
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:45,140
Speaker 1: Here, the bad guys basically are just building beast knights and sending them to fight.

559
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,658
Speaker 1: Monster of the week.

560
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:52,740
Speaker 1: And Volt's Five wins every week somehow, unless it's a two-parter or something.

561
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:55,840
Speaker 1: And then that's the show.

562
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,914
Speaker 1: I don't know what happens at the end because I'm only 17 episodes in.

563
00:42:59,105 --> 00:42:59,719
Speaker 1: I'm seven.

564
00:43:01,243 --> 00:43:05,640
Speaker 0: And I guess what I, I don't think we want to explain the plot and the characters to you.

565
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:07,799
Speaker 1: I explained the plot just now.

566
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,800
Speaker 0: But there's like the nuances, like each character has their deal.

567
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:17,840
Speaker 0: Like the jerky guy on the team is an American cowboy who uses a whip.

568
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,080
Speaker 0: And he's a jerk, but then he becomes less of a jerk.

569
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,680
Speaker 1: I don't know if he's Japanese and he spent time in the US or if he's actually American.

570
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,380
Speaker 0: Wasn't super clear, actually.

571
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

572
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:29,973
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

573
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,540
Speaker 0: Well, his mom blew herself up to kill those wolves.

574
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:33,777
Speaker 1: That's true.

575
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,300
Speaker 0: But the impressions I had were that, one, I want to get back to this after we talk about more impressions.

576
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:50,920
Speaker 0: The meta plot is shockingly more complex than it possibly even, like, they did not need to have that much backstory in the show.

577
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,619
Speaker 0: Or that much consistency.

578
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:59,760
Speaker 0: Like early parts of the show, because I do know some things that happened toward the end of the show, just from knowledge of the show.

579
00:44:01,702 --> 00:44:04,620
Speaker 0: The meta plot is way more complex than you'd realize.

580
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,360
Speaker 0: And every episode reveals little bits of it.

581
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,919
Speaker 0: Like early on, like these beast nights come down.

582
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:20,960
Speaker 0: But then you learn, I want to say in like episode three or four, that the evil aliens put brains of people, of their own people, into these things.

583
00:44:23,022 --> 00:44:25,770
Speaker 0: And that is not a piece of information to forget.

584
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,859
Speaker 0: That actually seems to matter a lot as the plot goes on.

585
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:37,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I think that's the two significant things about this show that make it stand out from your typical fight monsters every week.

586
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,980
Speaker 1: Because I actually think in a lot of ways this show is, despite being older and having a crappier toy...

587
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,140
Speaker 0: Oh, it's better than later Monster of the Week shows.

588
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, is more advanced even than Go Lion and other shows.

589
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:55,820
Speaker 1: And for these reasons, number one, you know, Voltron takes place in like this future, you know, like empty planet basically.

590
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,468
Speaker 1: This bad guy's attacking.

591
00:44:57,568 --> 00:44:59,560
Speaker 1: It's literally just Monster of the Week.

592
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,140
Speaker 0: It's a lot like Thundercats, or even Eman to a degree.

593
00:45:04,883 --> 00:45:07,539
Speaker 1: Thundercats has more of a plot that goes on, right?

594
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, but very little of that is revealed episode by episode.

595
00:45:12,582 --> 00:45:14,420
Speaker 1: I remember you didn't see the beginning of Thundercats.

596
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:18,375
Speaker 0: After the beginning, a lot of the later shows were refined.

597
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:19,560
Speaker 0: They'd have the beginning episodes.

598
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,940
Speaker 1: Thundercats has the pattern of plot episodes and non-plot episodes, right?

599
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,034
Speaker 0: Voltron has almost no plot episodes.

600
00:45:27,302 --> 00:45:29,100
Speaker 1: Voltron has almost no plot episodes.

601
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,158
Speaker 1: In Volt is Five, every episode I've seen is a plot episode.

602
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:40,080
Speaker 1: There is not just a Monster of the Week, but something significant happens in every episode.

603
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,240
Speaker 1: Sometimes the significant thing is simply character development, but it's not little character development.

604
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,600
Speaker 1: It'll be like big development for one character, right?

605
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:55,900
Speaker 1: In some episodes, it will be like, okay, it was just Monster of the Week, but there was a significant danger.

606
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,632
Speaker 1: Like they were not even, they were like getting really ruined.

607
00:45:59,913 --> 00:46:01,479
Speaker 1: Like the base got messed up.

608
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,080
Speaker 0: Well like episode two, the base almost collapses.

609
00:46:04,401 --> 00:46:10,580
Speaker 0: Their mom, I guess spoilers, fucking gets into a fighter jet and kamikazes the beast to buy them time.

610
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:12,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the thing.

611
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:13,920
Speaker 1: Some episodes, characters die.

612
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,396
Speaker 1: And it's like, yeah, Voltron, there's like one guy who dies.

613
00:46:16,496 --> 00:46:16,960
Speaker 1: Spoilers.

614
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,044
Speaker 1: But then that's kind of it.

615
00:46:18,506 --> 00:46:21,740
Speaker 1: Here, someone died and someone else died.

616
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,000
Speaker 1: It's like significant primary characters are getting the axe, right?

617
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,239
Speaker 1: Like shit goes down in Volt's Five on a frequent basis.

618
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:36,340
Speaker 1: And it's like, there is like stuff that like messes with you all the time.

619
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,860
Speaker 1: Like, whoa, this show is really going hardcore.

620
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,727
Speaker 1: There was one episode, right?

621
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:43,380
Speaker 1: And is the second significant thing.

622
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,926
Speaker 1: I'll tie it in here, right?

623
00:46:45,228 --> 00:46:53,760
Speaker 1: Is that this show actually takes place on an earth, a theoretical future earth that looks a lot like not really that far future an earth.

624
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,700
Speaker 1: But like the earth actually matters.

625
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,760
Speaker 1: There was a whole episode that was political where like the UN equivalent gets together and they can't agree.

626
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,880
Speaker 1: And then the diplomats all get endangered, right?

627
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,019
Speaker 1: And Voltus has to come and save them.

628
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,473
Speaker 1: And then they all agree to like actually ally against the aliens.

629
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:21,620
Speaker 0: And in the beginning, it's like there's a lot of science fiction and environmental storytelling and like world building.

630
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,320
Speaker 0: Like the global militaries are aligned differently from the current like real world.

631
00:47:26,664 --> 00:47:27,979
Speaker 0: And they all try to fight these things.

632
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:31,245
Speaker 1: It's like, is it deep?

633
00:47:31,627 --> 00:47:35,640
Speaker 1: No, but for a selling kids toys show, it's deep, right?

634
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,519
Speaker 1: Well, it's deeper than you might realize.

635
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,792
Speaker 1: It's like if you went to a kiddie pool, right?

636
00:47:40,852 --> 00:47:42,900
Speaker 1: And it's like, yes, this is a kiddie pool.

637
00:47:43,221 --> 00:47:44,608
Speaker 1: This is not the real pool.

638
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:45,693
Speaker 1: It's not the deep end.

639
00:47:46,136 --> 00:47:46,900
Speaker 1: It's a kiddie pool.

640
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,311
Speaker 1: But you get in and suddenly a kiddie pool usually is like what?

641
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,720
Speaker 1: Not even a foot deep usually, right?

642
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:55,740
Speaker 1: Imagine if the kiddie pool you stepped in and you were up to your waist.

643
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:56,985
Speaker 1: Like that's surprising.

644
00:47:57,547 --> 00:48:00,620
Speaker 1: Like, you know, you don't expect a kiddie pool to be that deep.

645
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:05,519
Speaker 0: What I know about the actual show, because I had had the plot described to me before I watched it.

646
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:09,120
Speaker 0: But what was described to me is like way later plot.

647
00:48:10,002 --> 00:48:12,360
Speaker 0: The home planet of these aliens matters a lot.

648
00:48:13,202 --> 00:48:14,049
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, it does.

649
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:14,492
Speaker 1: There is.

650
00:48:14,754 --> 00:48:15,600
Speaker 1: there is basically.

651
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,190
Speaker 0: How did Dr.

652
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,520
Speaker 0: Go know that they were coming?

653
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:20,640
Speaker 0: That is like a whole fucking thing.

654
00:48:21,422 --> 00:48:32,620
Speaker 1: Three of the people in there in the robot, the three are basically sons of these two scientists, one of whom is that mom who mentioned doing kamikaze.

655
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,225
Speaker 1: And the other one is Dr.

656
00:48:34,285 --> 00:48:37,620
Speaker 1: Go, who you never see in the show, at least not at the start.

657
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:41,640
Speaker 1: And you know that he knew the aliens were coming.

658
00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:46,680
Speaker 1: And therefore he built volts five to defend the earth from the aliens he knew were coming.

659
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:48,760
Speaker 1: And then he went off into space.

660
00:48:48,901 --> 00:48:52,740
Speaker 1: And you got to assume he went to meet the aliens out there in space.

661
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,506
Speaker 1: And then stuff happens in episodes.

662
00:48:56,626 --> 00:49:01,018
Speaker 1: I saw recently that show that the aliens at least know Dr.

663
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:01,680
Speaker 1: Go exists.

664
00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:05,378
Speaker 1: And nobody looks like and something is up.

665
00:49:05,498 --> 00:49:05,740
Speaker 1: Right.

666
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,119
Speaker 1: And it's like Voltron doesn't have anything like that.

667
00:49:08,421 --> 00:49:09,065
Speaker 1: I don't know.

668
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,420
Speaker 0: And in a lot of ways, it's the biggest takeaway.

669
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:14,780
Speaker 0: Watch that for even if you don't want to watch a stupid kid show like this.

670
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:21,000
Speaker 0: Watch the first episode and then go rewatch the first episode of Evangelion.

671
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:24,878
Speaker 0: They're honestly almost the same thing.

672
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:34,680
Speaker 0: Like the base they're defending is nerve to a T. Like the way they defended the dynamic of like all the people.

673
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,242
Speaker 1: It's also.

674
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:37,835
Speaker 1: I think the difference is the base is clearly a toy.

675
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:38,800
Speaker 1: Nerve is not a toy.

676
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,184
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, but it's still like.

677
00:49:40,846 --> 00:49:45,320
Speaker 0: those scenes are very similar to the scenes when nerve headquarters is under attack.

678
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:46,862
Speaker 0: The Dr.

679
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:52,439
Speaker 0: Go big gendo vibes in terms of the militaries of the world all trying to fight this new menace and they can't.

680
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:57,000
Speaker 0: And then they turn to that scientist who had a secret project going all along.

681
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,438
Speaker 0: There are so many parallels.

682
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:06,659
Speaker 0: Evangelion was 100% riffing on like the setup of this show and shows like it.

683
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,264
Speaker 1: Yep.

684
00:50:08,324 --> 00:50:13,620
Speaker 1: The last thing I got to say about the show is that, you know, it is significantly hardcore.

685
00:50:15,021 --> 00:50:20,880
Speaker 0: When Voltus 5 kills a beast knight, like that is a brutal scene with that sword.

686
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:21,922
Speaker 1: Right.

687
00:50:21,942 --> 00:50:25,940
Speaker 1: Voltus 5 takes out a sword just like to cut the bad guy as like it's finishing blow.

688
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:29,320
Speaker 1: You know that when the sword comes out, like the bad guys get the beast knights going down.

689
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:37,300
Speaker 1: Voltus 5, when he does the V attack with the sword, hits the beast knight in its shoulder or whatever its shoulder.

690
00:50:37,822 --> 00:50:41,220
Speaker 0: We learned later these beast knights have sentient brains implanted into them.

691
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,282
Speaker 1: Right.

692
00:50:42,302 --> 00:50:45,140
Speaker 1: These beast knights also come in, they're really fun and creative.

693
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,160
Speaker 1: The lots of different shapes and sizes.

694
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,220
Speaker 1: The episode I just watched, the beast knight was a flying triceratops.

695
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,138
Speaker 1: Voltus eventually eclipses its wings and it becomes a regular triceratops.

696
00:50:57,062 --> 00:51:01,620
Speaker 1: But there's like, they're always an interesting shape and size and they always like animate them.

697
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:06,640
Speaker 1: Like there's the stock footage of the combinations, but the battles are not stock footage.

698
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,767
Speaker 1: They're not great animation.

699
00:51:07,808 --> 00:51:08,231
Speaker 1: It's 1970s TV animation.

700
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,420
Speaker 1: But they're like real fights.

701
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,700
Speaker 1: But yeah, they're animating kind of in a pro wrestling kind of fashion.

702
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,101
Speaker 1: Right.

703
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:17,200
Speaker 1: You know, the pro wrestling vibe in the battles.

704
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:28,460
Speaker 1: But yeah, Voltus will take its sword, hit the enemy in its shoulder equivalent, slice down at an angle to near its groin, navel area, twist the sword around.

705
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,940
Speaker 1: And they show this to you like a visceral highlight.

706
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,420
Speaker 1: They highlight the twisting of the sword like it's just a mat.

707
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:46,423
Speaker 1: You imagine like a sword twisting in your guts like, oh, and then we'll pull the sword back up and out the other shoulder, making a V shaped cut because it's Voltus five Roman numeral V. Right.

708
00:51:47,006 --> 00:51:49,540
Speaker 1: And it's like the V, the sword V attack or whatever.

709
00:51:50,043 --> 00:51:52,840
Speaker 1: And then the enemy will explode like it just got fist of the North Star.

710
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:54,593
Speaker 1: And this happens every episode.

711
00:51:54,734 --> 00:51:55,420
Speaker 1: It is brutal.

712
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:59,740
Speaker 1: But not just that brutality, but like characters are getting shot.

713
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,440
Speaker 1: They're like times where like, you know, that the enemies will be like stabbing.

714
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:09,360
Speaker 1: And you'll see like the enemies, like stabs, like come into the cockpit and almost hit the pilots.

715
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,839
Speaker 0: Or remember, there's the sword wielding demon knight that has that sword, the special magic sword.

716
00:52:16,382 --> 00:52:19,740
Speaker 0: And the one dude has to train to learn how to fight the sword.

717
00:52:20,401 --> 00:52:21,171
Speaker 0: And that training is him.

718
00:52:21,211 --> 00:52:21,819
Speaker 0: get it like that.

719
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:29,940
Speaker 0: He, the amount of physical injury that is animated on him in that episode is very surprising.

720
00:52:30,742 --> 00:52:35,119
Speaker 1: Now the one, the one in Congress, there's a lot of incongruous things because it's a kid's show.

721
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:42,380
Speaker 1: But the biggest one for me is that the start of the show, not a spoiler, the bad guys invade and they destroy the shit out of earth.

722
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:44,750
Speaker 1: Like they wreck it.

723
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:46,960
Speaker 1: It's like what is even left on earth, right?

724
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:53,620
Speaker 1: And then in another episode, it's like the kid goes to a model boat sailing contest in Tokyo.

725
00:52:54,582 --> 00:52:59,560
Speaker 1: And it's like, you're having model boat sailing contest, Tokyo still exists?

726
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:01,099
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it got destroyed.

727
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,039
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, the kids were still going to school in Evangelion for some reason.

728
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,680
Speaker 1: Maybe, but they were going like the nerve school in the protected area, right?

729
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,900
Speaker 1: Not in the city, you know, not in Tokyo.

730
00:53:11,061 --> 00:53:15,960
Speaker 1: Anyway, but then, uh, fricking Tokyo gets destroyed, right?

731
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:18,440
Speaker 1: And it's like, okay, well now Tokyo is destroyed.

732
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,980
Speaker 1: It's like, no, then it's back to normal.

733
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,460
Speaker 1: They don't seem to like keep like that world is destroyed thing.

734
00:53:23,842 --> 00:53:27,060
Speaker 1: The way that like space battleship Yamato is like, yeah, the world is destroyed.

735
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:33,300
Speaker 0: Part of the way that seems to fit in is that they, the aliens show up and are fucking up earth and ready to rock.

736
00:53:33,621 --> 00:53:37,280
Speaker 0: But then when Volt is five, the Evangelion appears, they back off.

737
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:41,160
Speaker 0: They're like, oh shit, there's, there's a danger and actually dangerous thing here.

738
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:42,779
Speaker 0: We can't just take over.

739
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:48,940
Speaker 0: And they sort of like retreat to their sanctum to deal with that threat before they resume the invasion.

740
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:56,478
Speaker 1: Right now, the final thing that really makes me like the show quite a bit is that, you know, when you watch a kid's show, right?

741
00:53:57,121 --> 00:53:59,900
Speaker 1: It's like, why don't the bad guys just do this?

742
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,680
Speaker 1: Why don't the bad guys just do that?

743
00:54:03,381 --> 00:54:09,880
Speaker 0: It's like, I was watching an episode and I thought, wow, the way the show is structured, if they just sent two beast knights at one time, like they're fucked.

744
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,288
Speaker 0: It's over.

745
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:10,739
Speaker 0: Game over.

746
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,100
Speaker 0: That's, this is a kid's show.

747
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,900
Speaker 0: They should just send two beast knights, literally the next episode.

748
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,839
Speaker 0: They send two beast knights and they almost win because of that.

749
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:18,980
Speaker 1: Exactly.

750
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,718
Speaker 1: That's what it's like.

751
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,700
Speaker 1: The bad guys in this show are not fools, right?

752
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,120
Speaker 0: They are actually not Skeletor fucking up over and over and over again.

753
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,799
Speaker 0: Imagine if Skeletor was like, well, that didn't work.

754
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,739
Speaker 0: Let's try a different plan.

755
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:36,280
Speaker 1: They're not failing from incompetence, right?

756
00:54:36,381 --> 00:54:43,020
Speaker 1: They're failing, you know, due to simply, you know, volt is five and the Falcon team Falcons, the base, right?

757
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:53,460
Speaker 1: Like going all out and using, you know, the ingenuity and strength and whatever of humanity, um, to like come through the impossible odds.

758
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:53,800
Speaker 0: Right.

759
00:54:54,381 --> 00:54:55,840
Speaker 1: The bad guys are not fools.

760
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,660
Speaker 1: Like they're constantly, they're like, what if we could just stop voltage five from combining?

761
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:01,520
Speaker 1: It would be five separate shitty vehicles.

762
00:55:01,947 --> 00:55:02,598
Speaker 1: They do it.

763
00:55:02,825 --> 00:55:02,889
Speaker 0: Yup.

764
00:55:03,204 --> 00:55:03,400
Speaker 1: Right.

765
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:03,897
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait.

766
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,140
Speaker 0: The kid's off on his own.

767
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,017
Speaker 0: They, they send a beast knight literally just to murder the kid.

768
00:55:08,923 --> 00:55:09,999
Speaker 1: Like, they're like, Ooh, what?

769
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,080
Speaker 1: They're like, Oh, why did that one vehicle leave the base to go on its own?

770
00:55:13,463 --> 00:55:14,476
Speaker 1: Let's go get it.

771
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:15,780
Speaker 1: It's separated.

772
00:55:15,984 --> 00:55:16,658
Speaker 1: Let's go, go, go.

773
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:17,000
Speaker 1: Right.

774
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,000
Speaker 1: The, the bad guys are not fools.

775
00:55:19,464 --> 00:55:20,640
Speaker 1: They go all out.

776
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:29,960
Speaker 1: They do not hold back in trying to destroy volt as five, you know, and volt is five, you know, comes really close to losing compared to other big robots I've seen.

777
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:33,779
Speaker 1: And it only wins by like the skin of its teeth.

778
00:55:34,382 --> 00:55:38,540
Speaker 0: Uh, obviously like in one episode, like actually breaks through that shield.

779
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:48,799
Speaker 0: You know, that scene in Ava near the very end where an angel busts into the room and it's like, like Misato's looking up at it and they, everyone just freezes and it's, it's about to do its thing.

780
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:54,140
Speaker 0: One of the beasts kind of does the same thing to the base and they barely survive.

781
00:55:54,362 --> 00:55:56,080
Speaker 0: And it's, it's, it's a pretty good scene.

782
00:55:56,582 --> 00:55:59,999
Speaker 0: They animate that beast, like beating the shit out of the base too.

783
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:07,200
Speaker 1: So, uh, and like the base like got messed up, like they had to, they couldn't get out from one scene I watched recently.

784
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:07,897
Speaker 1: You didn't see this.

785
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:13,459
Speaker 1: The, they couldn't open the gates to get the, you know, to fly the voltage vehicles out of the, I saw that one.

786
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:15,379
Speaker 0: I think that happens in an episode I saw.

787
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:16,740
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

788
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,459
Speaker 0: And then they're like, shoot missiles at it and they blow up the gate.

789
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:20,240
Speaker 1: Exactly.

790
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,659
Speaker 1: They shot, they just blew up the front of the base and flew out.

791
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:28,039
Speaker 1: And then later, uh, the front of the base is like still blown up.

792
00:56:29,241 --> 00:56:33,280
Speaker 0: Or also like one episode I was thinking, why do they even have all these defenses?

793
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:35,780
Speaker 0: They just animate these defenses of getting destroyed by the beast.

794
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,079
Speaker 0: Every episode, the next episode, they had a stronger missile that actually like gave the beast pause.

795
00:56:42,294 --> 00:56:42,399
Speaker 1: Yeah.

796
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,507
Speaker 1: And they have like the tops.

797
00:56:43,688 --> 00:56:45,540
Speaker 1: at first, the tops kind of are garbage.

798
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,000
Speaker 1: I'm like, well, I just pull out the sword right away.

799
00:56:47,401 --> 00:56:49,539
Speaker 1: Sometimes they do just pull out the sword right away.

800
00:56:49,861 --> 00:56:51,919
Speaker 1: Sometimes they do just combine right away.

801
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,629
Speaker 1: Sometimes sometimes they don't even need to combine.

802
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:55,372
Speaker 1: the other items work.

803
00:56:57,741 --> 00:56:59,740
Speaker 0: They spin a different thing, not the top.

804
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,319
Speaker 0: They spin like some projectile that the beast shot at them.

805
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:03,220
Speaker 1: Right.

806
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:08,140
Speaker 1: It's like, they're getting creative and not just doing the same stuff every time in the battle portions.

807
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:13,280
Speaker 1: Um, cause usually, you know, this kind of show, you just want to see the other parts and fast forward the battle.

808
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:15,259
Speaker 1: Cause the battle is the same boring thing every time.

809
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,759
Speaker 1: Um, so yeah, volt is five has a lot going on.

810
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:25,798
Speaker 1: I think, you know, I'm not going to say I recommend it cause it is a kid's show to sell you a toy.

811
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,900
Speaker 0: I would watch this before I would watch go lion.

812
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:30,019
Speaker 1: Yeah.

813
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,020
Speaker 1: I mean, this is a show so far from what I seen.

814
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:37,940
Speaker 1: If you're gonna watch a show to sell kids toys, why not this one?

815
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:38,518
Speaker 1: Right.

816
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:40,739
Speaker 1: And you're not going to watch such a show.

817
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:42,338
Speaker 1: Don't watch any of them.

818
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:53,680
Speaker 0: But if you're an anime fan at all, like if you actually like think about and care about anime specifically, watch one episode of this and watch the first episode of Evangelion again and do a compare and contrast.

819
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,817
Speaker 0: Like, trust me.

820
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:55,939
Speaker 1: Or watch it.

821
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:56,260
Speaker 1: Watch it.

822
00:57:56,421 --> 00:57:58,292
Speaker 1: Go one episode of go lion also random one.

823
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,018
Speaker 1: Cause there are a lot of them are more similar to each other.

824
00:58:02,461 --> 00:58:05,680
Speaker 0: But this show, like if you skip, like I thought like I watched seven episodes.

825
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,480
Speaker 0: I was like, I should skip ahead and watch like a random episode from like a few later.

826
00:58:08,883 --> 00:58:10,439
Speaker 0: so I could like have more to talk about on the show.

827
00:58:10,942 --> 00:58:13,740
Speaker 0: I skipped a few episodes ahead and I have no fucking idea what's going on anymore.

828
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:14,850
Speaker 1: Yeah.

829
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,920
Speaker 1: Like I said, the status, there is no like solid status quo.

830
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,378
Speaker 1: It's like they keep changing it.

831
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:25,740
Speaker 1: And that, you know, under normal, more normal circumstances of this kind of show wouldn't have kept watching.

832
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,180
Speaker 1: But, uh, this one I did.

833
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:33,160
Speaker 0: So the fact that we both kept watching and didn't just watch the minimum four and then do this show is telling.

834
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:33,600
Speaker 1: Right.

835
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:33,793
Speaker 1: Yeah.

836
00:58:33,922 --> 00:58:34,920
Speaker 1: So it's on crunchy roll.

837
00:58:35,283 --> 00:58:36,317
Speaker 1: Uh, you can just go watch it.

838
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:39,360
Speaker 1: Um, and that's that volt is volts five.

839
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:40,616
Speaker 1: However you want to pronounce it.

840
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:43,599
Speaker 1: Um, Chodenji machine volts five.

841
