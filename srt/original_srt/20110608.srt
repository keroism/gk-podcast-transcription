1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:08,840
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,716
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, June 8th, 2011.

3
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:12,578
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:13,239
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,603
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:17,690
Speaker 1: Tonight's double feature, Wakfu and Hippy-a-ra.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,848
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,485
Speaker 0: So did you see Steve Jobs?

9
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:32,731
Speaker 0: He was all going to the Cupertino town council and showing him the building he wants to build to put all his people in.

10
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:34,300
Speaker 1: I did not see that.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,540
Speaker 0: Oh, because basically what happened there, right, is the Apple's got too many people now for their campus, right?

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,789
Speaker 0: So HP is leaving to go to a different town.

13
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:50,717
Speaker 0: So they basically, HP's moving out and he's buying HP's land and he wants to build this gigantic 12,000 person circular building.

14
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:51,480
Speaker 0: Actually looks pretty cool.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,032
Speaker 1: Oh, you realize that's one RIT.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,063
Speaker 0: Yeah.

17
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,953
Speaker 0: You know, and it's actually a pretty good plan.

18
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:00,440
Speaker 0: I was like, oh dude, that's sweet, right?

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Speaker 1: Alright, but there's clearly a but here.

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,769
Speaker 0: So my office is doing a similar situation, right?

21
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:15,500
Speaker 0: Where it's like, basically this, you know, a company bought us and they have another office in town, but our office is better, so they want to move their people in their other office in town into our office.

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,316
Speaker 1: We did a similar thing before where we basically bought as much of our floor as we could.

23
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:21,380
Speaker 1: We have like most of the floor.

24
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:30,608
Speaker 1: And then we were doing all this renovations, we needed all this space, and then now that we laid off a quarter of the company, we don't need that space anymore.

25
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,460
Speaker 1: So now, after a long time, they're kind of down renovating.

26
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:44,349
Speaker 0: But anyway, so for like months, there have been people coming in, because we work in an area of the office that was sort of empty, and it was just us and a bunch of empty space.

27
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,820
Speaker 0: So that was clearly the space to be renovated.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,244
Speaker 1: I mean, it was like that in the IBM.

29
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:50,652
Speaker 1: I mean, my hallway was like half empty.

30
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:54,458
Speaker 1: in the building and the floor under us, there were just like empty locked rooms.

31
00:01:54,821 --> 00:02:09,306
Speaker 0: Right, so, you know, that's the space they were going to move into, so people have been walking around us and whispering and all this kind of, you know, and like, we've noticed people walking around with measuring tapes and blueprints and all sorts of stuff for months and weeks, but no one told us dick.

32
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:11,640
Speaker 0: And it's like, uh...

33
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:19,800
Speaker 1: I'm starting to get sick of, it's weird how all the smaller companies I've worked for are like, they're so secretive about everything.

34
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:21,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I really want to talk about, right?

35
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:27,120
Speaker 0: Because basically, you know, we found out, you know, I don't care what they decide, put me in a tiny box, put me in a big office, I don't really care, right?

36
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,160
Speaker 0: But it's like, they just wait till the last second to tell you anything, and they're just so discourteous and secretive for no reason.

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,635
Speaker 0: But look at Steve Jobs, the most secretive guy in the universe, right?

38
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:45,387
Speaker 0: He doesn't want anyone to know anything, but he'll go to the town council, a public forum, and see, here's the giant building I want to build, here's the blueprints, here's what we want to do, right?

39
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:49,906
Speaker 0: He's out about it, you know, stuff like that, stuff that affects the employees.

40
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:54,740
Speaker 0: He's going to tell the employee what the employee needs to know, and the people in the town what they need to know.

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,791
Speaker 0: He's not going to, you know, keep things secret just for no reason.

42
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,060
Speaker 0: He has at least what he thinks is the reason most of the time.

43
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,624
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's a more general problem.

44
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:07,973
Speaker 1: There are a lot of, I'm feeling like secrets are one of the biggest problems we've got right now, because secrets cause corruption.

45
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, we talk all about the time, mostly what we talk about is that government unnecessarily keeps too many things confidential.

46
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:30,380
Speaker 0: But it's not just government that has a problem with secrets, and it's not just companies either, it's just people in general keep things secret unnecessarily for no reason and often cause more harm than, you know, that didn't need to be caused.

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:44,700
Speaker 0: If they would just share information, basically people follow a policy of keep everything secret except for what you absolutely can't keep secret, where what you should do is keep everything public except for what you absolutely cannot make public.

48
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,560
Speaker 0: That is the policy you need to follow.

49
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:54,120
Speaker 1: But specifically with the corporate stuff, like in jobs, it's really weird to me that the mundane stuff is usually a better kept secret.

50
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:59,080
Speaker 1: Like, I didn't even know about the layoffs back when we had all the layoffs until the day it happened.

51
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:01,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, that's an HR thing.

52
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,420
Speaker 0: There's sometimes legal reasons you have to keep that secret.

53
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,169
Speaker 1: But simultaneously, there's a corporate move.

54
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,100
Speaker 1: To this day, I don't officially know that we're moving offices and they're moving stuff around.

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,094
Speaker 1: I know no, because I know shit, but I don't officially know.

56
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:16,680
Speaker 1: No one has officially informed me of anything.

57
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:18,380
Speaker 1: It's annoying.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
Speaker 0: It is, it's very annoying.

59
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,940
Speaker 1: Much like how the anime industry is super secretive about everything for no reason.

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:38,059
Speaker 0: And it's totally, you know, in a situation like I'm in where it's like, I'm working here, you're someone who's moving in, this affects me and the people I'm working with, and it's just, you know, it's just discourteous not to tell us.

61
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,279
Speaker 1: At the same time.

62
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,149
Speaker 0: It's like, you're not obligated to tell me.

63
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:43,580
Speaker 0: You don't need to make me a part of the decision making process.

64
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,180
Speaker 1: More than once.

65
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,743
Speaker 0: But you know what?

66
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,880
Speaker 0: But the fact that you don't tell me makes me think you're a jerk.

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,740
Speaker 0: It's like, the only really harm you've done is make me hate the upper management and think they're all jerks.

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,920
Speaker 1: But at the same time, are you not simply a mercenary?

69
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, the point is, you know.

70
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,612
Speaker 1: I mean, you don't tell the mercenaries the strategy.

71
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:01,740
Speaker 1: You don't care.

72
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,276
Speaker 0: But if they just told me, I wouldn't think they were jerks.

73
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:04,839
Speaker 0: I would like them.

74
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:09,700
Speaker 1: Ah, but does you thinking someone's a jerk in any way materially impact anything?

75
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, it makes me want to get out of there.

76
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you- And they don't want me to leave.

77
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:15,399
Speaker 1: Ah, we'll see what happens.

78
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:23,120
Speaker 0: The other thing, right, the other situation is, right, is like when a big higher up guy, right, gets a gigantic office and everyone else is stuck in tiny cubes, right?

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,091
Speaker 0: And it's like, okay, you're the highest up guy.

80
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,840
Speaker 0: You have a right to do that, right?

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,940
Speaker 0: That is your privilege for being, you know, the top CEO or whatever you are.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,199
Speaker 1: Or I can understand situations where there are people who have enough responsibility to where they need kind of a private large office with just space to have meetings and do stuff in.

83
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:43,780
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't need to host private meetings often enough to have my own dedicated space.

84
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:46,440
Speaker 1: I can go, you know, check out one of the conference rooms.

85
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:56,340
Speaker 0: Of course, but by doing so, right, by having an excessively large office, what message did that send to the rest of the employees, right?

86
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,284
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

87
00:05:57,344 --> 00:06:00,115
Speaker 0: basically you're saying, I'm a big jerk.

88
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:01,380
Speaker 0: Who cares about myself?

89
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,187
Speaker 0: Fuck you all.

90
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:03,079
Speaker 0: Get in the tiny cube.

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,720
Speaker 0: You know, it's like you have a right to put me in a tiny cube.

92
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,160
Speaker 1: What if it's meritocracy, Scott?

93
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Speaker 1: What if it's where the people whose jobs are most important have the nicest offices?

94
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:11,580
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

95
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,458
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, what if?

96
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,260
Speaker 1: Would you be mad if it was a meritocracy?

97
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:16,980
Speaker 0: You know, it depends.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,320
Speaker 1: I mean, the people who are better get paid more.

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,180
Speaker 1: How is that different than having a bigger office?

100
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,680
Speaker 0: Actually, I think that it shouldn't be secret when people get paid either.

101
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:27,239
Speaker 1: I'm very open about what I get paid.

102
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:27,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too.

103
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:41,059
Speaker 1: Except at work because everyone's like, well, actually everyone I know outside of like the geek community and outside of like, you know, my circle of friends, people are super cagey and really don't want other people to know what they make.

104
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,480
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's actually that is sort of a conspiracy by companies.

105
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,400
Speaker 0: They don't what they want.

106
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:53,696
Speaker 0: They someone intentionally back in the day wanted some company wanted to make it a stigma to let people know what you made.

107
00:06:53,736 --> 00:07:03,620
Speaker 1: because not to not to name names, companies I have worked for or may currently work for have stipulations in contracts stating that I cannot disclose to other employees how much I make.

108
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,699
Speaker 1: Or other benefits that I have.

109
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,158
Speaker 1: That's right.

110
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,420
Speaker 1: Like, for example, I have stock options in my company, right?

111
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:08,798
Speaker 1: Yeah.

112
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,680
Speaker 1: Most of my co-workers don't even know stock options were an option.

113
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:15,500
Speaker 1: And I'm not allowed to tell them that I have them.

114
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,060
Speaker 0: It's only a benefit to employees to know what your fellow employees make.

115
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:26,247
Speaker 0: If you all shared, if everyone told everyone else what you made, then, you know, you might.

116
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:30,020
Speaker 0: someone might be upset at finding out that they're being paid a lot less than someone else.

117
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:34,500
Speaker 0: But since everyone knows how much everyone's contributing, right?

118
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,380
Speaker 0: It's like if I get paid a little less than this other guy who does more work than me, it's like we look at each other and we're like, yeah, all right, you do more work.

119
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,820
Speaker 1: But usually what happens is a company has someone who's been there a long time.

120
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:44,697
Speaker 1: They need them.

121
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:47,180
Speaker 1: So they're giving them increasing salaries to keep them around.

122
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:48,619
Speaker 1: And then they hire someone new.

123
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:54,200
Speaker 1: And because that person might not be familiar with the pay grades of that industry, they pay them the minimum possible.

124
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,860
Speaker 0: Exactly.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,240
Speaker 0: So sharing information, someone might be upset at finding out the truth.

126
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:06,800
Speaker 0: But then if you actually had balls and would go to the people who make the decisions to be like, hey, we've discovered this is unfair.

127
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,760
Speaker 0: Fix it, asshole.

128
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:08,640
Speaker 0: Right.

129
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,080
Speaker 0: Then suddenly they're in the ones who are in the deep shit and the employees become empowered, even without unionizing.

130
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:19,920
Speaker 0: Just by sharing information, you could empower yourselves and get more money for everyone.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,519
Speaker 0: You're not going to get less money for anyone.

132
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:22,220
Speaker 0: Right.

133
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:29,640
Speaker 0: You're just going to get more money by sharing this information at the expense of, you know, some people who are really sensitive, you know, being upset.

134
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,320
Speaker 0: But I'm sure they won't be upset if they had the balls to go and fight for their money.

135
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:41,539
Speaker 1: But I foresee the people who are most likely to be upset are the ones who aren't paid that much and who probably don't have any sway to be paid anymore.

136
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:42,320
Speaker 0: Right.

137
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,460
Speaker 0: So then it's just, hey, you know, you've there was a truth that you aren't really worth that much to us.

138
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:48,479
Speaker 0: And now it is revealed.

139
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:49,358
Speaker 0: Great.

140
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:49,956
Speaker 1: Yeah.

141
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,959
Speaker 0: And your choice is to continue working here or not get a job somewhere else because you suck.

142
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,439
Speaker 1: I will at least for now continue to make my one hundred and thirty five thousand dollars a year.

143
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:58,793
Speaker 0: Yeah.

144
00:08:59,163 --> 00:08:59,832
Speaker 0: I make 70 something.

145
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,317
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

146
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:01,796
Speaker 0: Wow.

147
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:03,679
Speaker 1: I make almost double what you make.

148
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:06,239
Speaker 1: And yet you probably do more work than me.

149
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:06,876
Speaker 0: No, no.

150
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,660
Speaker 0: But you're going to watch out.

151
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,339
Speaker 0: I'm going to fight next.

152
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,220
Speaker 0: Because the thing is, I'm so I'm too nice.

153
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,328
Speaker 0: Right.

154
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,080
Speaker 0: As much as I say the balls to fight for whatever.

155
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,519
Speaker 1: I've been thinking about that lately because I know my problem.

156
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:17,820
Speaker 1: I've been seriously debate doing the same.

157
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I think that's that's what you know, how we always talk about, you know, the nerds who could be the most dangerous, who could bring society crashing down or too nice.

158
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:27,320
Speaker 0: That's why we don't do terrorism, even though we could.

159
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:27,740
Speaker 0: Right.

160
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:28,940
Speaker 0: And it's the same thing.

161
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:29,739
Speaker 0: It's like I'm a nerd.

162
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,338
Speaker 0: I'm too nice.

163
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:33,620
Speaker 0: I don't go in there and be like, give me more money.

164
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:34,194
Speaker 0: Asshole.

165
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,140
Speaker 1: It depends.

166
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,280
Speaker 1: It depends on how much you care.

167
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,240
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll be honest.

168
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:46,859
Speaker 1: When I worked at my previous job hospital, I went into my boss and I was like, look, unless you give me a hundred percent raise, I'm going to give you my two weeks notice.

169
00:09:48,142 --> 00:09:51,460
Speaker 1: And then, yeah, the guy was like, yeah, that was me.

170
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:52,260
Speaker 0: That was quitting.

171
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:52,558
Speaker 0: Right.

172
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,039
Speaker 0: That wasn't actually negotiating.

173
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,162
Speaker 1: Well, I gave.

174
00:09:55,183 --> 00:10:05,660
Speaker 1: I gave an ultimatum because had he doubled my salary, I might I probably would have stuck around a little while longer than quit anyway after I had a pile of money.

175
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:06,980
Speaker 1: But that's a separate problem.

176
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:07,460
Speaker 0: Right.

177
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,619
Speaker 0: But the point is, I'm too nice.

178
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:15,020
Speaker 0: I've never once actually negotiated or fought because everyone who's ever paid me has paid me enough to live.

179
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,131
Speaker 0: Right.

180
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:15,919
Speaker 0: I'm paying the rent.

181
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:23,260
Speaker 0: I'm buying everything I could possibly want to buy, you know, giant boxes of comic books every month, computers, anything I need an Amazon.

182
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,259
Speaker 0: I just buy it without thinking I pay the rent, I pay all the bills and my bank account balance just keeps going up.

183
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:30,880
Speaker 0: So I'm like, I'm so non greedy.

184
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:32,139
Speaker 0: I'm just like, whatever.

185
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:34,760
Speaker 0: So I never fight for more money or anything.

186
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:37,260
Speaker 0: But next time I decide, you know, it's been too long.

187
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:39,940
Speaker 0: I realize you don't get anywhere without fighting.

188
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,479
Speaker 0: So now I'm going to fight the next time I get a chance when there's a review or whatever there is that ever.

189
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,600
Speaker 1: Ah, my company is very smart about that.

190
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,299
Speaker 1: They stopped giving reviews years ago.

191
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,900
Speaker 0: So that's a genius move.

192
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:50,479
Speaker 1: So that way.

193
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,239
Speaker 1: Because think about this.

194
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:52,620
Speaker 1: No one ever asks you anymore.

195
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:54,179
Speaker 1: Hey, are you happy?

196
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:55,339
Speaker 1: What's going on?

197
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,920
Speaker 1: So you never have an excuse to be like, yeah, I'm kind of bored.

198
00:10:58,302 --> 00:10:59,020
Speaker 0: But it doesn't matter.

199
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,409
Speaker 0: There is going to be some sort of H.R.

200
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,555
Speaker 0: event at some point.

201
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:06,259
Speaker 0: that will give me an opportunity to negotiate in some form.

202
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,100
Speaker 0: But when that comes, I'm basically going to be like, look, I want 30 vacation days.

203
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,080
Speaker 0: I know I've been joking about 30 vacation days, but now I'm actually serious.

204
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:14,979
Speaker 0: I want 30 vacation days.

205
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:15,844
Speaker 0: No, I'm not.

206
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:18,500
Speaker 0: I'm not getting if you don't give me 30 vacation.

207
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,360
Speaker 1: Well, your logic is sound because to summarize it, you basically pointed out that, all right, you could make more money elsewhere.

208
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:24,312
Speaker 1: Both of us could.

209
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:24,719
Speaker 0: Yeah.

210
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,740
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's a pain in the ass to switch jobs and all that sort of thing.

211
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:30,560
Speaker 1: And anyone can just offer more money.

212
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:34,139
Speaker 1: So there's no benefit to fighting for more money one place versus another place.

213
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,800
Speaker 1: But nobody, for some reason, the American like industry system is fucked up to where nobody gives anybody shit for vacation days.

214
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,268
Speaker 0: That's right.

215
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:42,858
Speaker 0: Even me.

216
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,732
Speaker 0: But in Europe.

217
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,080
Speaker 0: Right.

218
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,400
Speaker 0: It's 30 days minimum and no one has any jobs.

219
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,660
Speaker 0: There are some places where it's like 60 days minimum.

220
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,859
Speaker 1: Scott, most people have three hundred and sixty five days.

221
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,189
Speaker 0: Whoa.

222
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:54,639
Speaker 1: Yeah.

223
00:11:54,921 --> 00:12:01,540
Speaker 0: Oh, well, you know, the so the idly wealthy and the unemployed.

224
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:07,040
Speaker 1: So because no one gives anyone vacation days, I mean, I don't even get as many as I want.

225
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,558
Speaker 0: If they gave me 30 vacation days, I basically would have to stay there for less pay.

226
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:18,180
Speaker 0: for, you know, as long as I could do to come to gave me 30 actual vacation days going anywhere else would reset me to 10.

227
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,500
Speaker 1: Well, the biggest thing I realize the real problem here is pretty fundamental.

228
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:24,880
Speaker 1: I would take a 50 percent pay cut to work 50 percent of the time.

229
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:25,806
Speaker 0: Yep.

230
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:26,998
Speaker 1: And that would be awesome for me.

231
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:27,620
Speaker 0: Yep.

232
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:33,109
Speaker 1: And no one is going to pay me seventy thousand dollars a year to only work six months out of the year.

233
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,900
Speaker 0: No, but here's the other.

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,202
Speaker 0: Right.

235
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:35,879
Speaker 0: So they could give me more money.

236
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:40,665
Speaker 0: But like I said, even at my current pay, my bank account is increasing because I'm so frugal.

237
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:41,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you're so great.

238
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,940
Speaker 1: We're so rich and we're just rubbing it into all the listeners faces.

239
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:50,524
Speaker 0: Listen, if you guys go and study computer science and are good at it, you can end up in the same way, too.

240
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,302
Speaker 1: But you also got to be lucky and for, you know, you want to the real secret.

241
00:12:53,362 --> 00:13:02,401
Speaker 1: But then what we should get onto the actual show, you know, and the real secret is one, actually be smart to learn computers, because that's where you make all the money.

242
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:02,844
Speaker 1: Yeah.

243
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:07,080
Speaker 1: There are a few other specialty fields you can make equal money in, but three live in New York computers.

244
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,824
Speaker 1: The ones that we know.

245
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:10,100
Speaker 1: you don't have to live in New York for a major city.

246
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,601
Speaker 1: Yeah.

247
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:15,842
Speaker 1: But the biggest thing, too, is you've got to be willing and able to sell yourself.

248
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:30,639
Speaker 1: You've got like everyone I see when I interview people to hire, like to work for me, they're like they're so cookie cutter, like I don't remember their names, like everyone looks the same, talks the same, wears the same suit with the same like color, like the power tie and the earth tone.

249
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,340
Speaker 1: The resume is all like identical.

250
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,000
Speaker 1: It's like nobody stands out.

251
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,840
Speaker 1: No one's willing to let their real personality show through.

252
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,722
Speaker 1: In an interview, everyone always acts the way they expect corporations to expect them to act.

253
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:43,379
Speaker 1: You realize every interview I've ever done, I act like me.

254
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:45,609
Speaker 0: That's like the other day when I was in the.

255
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,624
Speaker 1: I'm like, yeah, I do a podcast called Geek Knives about nerdy shit.

256
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:56,200
Speaker 0: We usually eat in the park outside of Barclays, which is, you know, it's one of those public private parks like they own it, but it's public.

257
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,740
Speaker 0: Oh, speaking of which, and there were these guys walking around with name tags.

258
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,098
Speaker 0: They're all wearing the same suit.

259
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:04,339
Speaker 0: And it was like I was like, oh, my God, I'm so glad we're not those guys.

260
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,804
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's actually the fact that my company doesn't have a dress code because I wear suits like every day.

261
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:17,523
Speaker 1: But now that it's warm today and I was biking to work until my fucking bike got stolen, I stopped wearing suits and started wearing just T-shirts.

262
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:24,500
Speaker 1: And I kind of don't want to go back to wearing suits ever again, even though I really like wearing suits because I get, you know, it'll never get cold again.

263
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,658
Speaker 1: It's going to be warm like this forever.

264
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:32,080
Speaker 1: Anyway, so anime, manga, comics, news.

265
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:33,404
Speaker 0: Yep.

266
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:34,860
Speaker 0: Oh, you want some news?

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,150
Speaker 1: I think we should actually talk about.

268
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,280
Speaker 1: we don't want to be Dave and Joel here.

269
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:37,603
Speaker 1: All right.

270
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:39,320
Speaker 0: So there was a gigantic comics news.

271
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,610
Speaker 0: I don't know if we've talked about it on the show.

272
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,438
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure we haven't.

273
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,042
Speaker 0: All right.

274
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:43,759
Speaker 0: It's pretty much the biggest comics news ever.

275
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:47,680
Speaker 0: DC Comics is going to relaunch.

276
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,060
Speaker 0: Some people are saying reboot, but the official word is relaunch.

277
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:53,050
Speaker 1: That's the distinction.

278
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,760
Speaker 1: there matters a lot to people who care.

279
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:55,122
Speaker 1: Right.

280
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:57,880
Speaker 0: So about this is this is actually what is happening.

281
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,504
Speaker 0: They're going to.

282
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:04,140
Speaker 0: in a couple of months, every comic, every single DC comic will end.

283
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:10,379
Speaker 0: And instead, there will be fifty two new DC comics that will all be number one in the same month.

284
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,380
Speaker 0: And those will be the DC Comics.

285
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,519
Speaker 0: There'll be fifty two of them.

286
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,359
Speaker 0: They will start with number one all over again.

287
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,897
Speaker 0: The thing is, it's a relaunch.

288
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:18,180
Speaker 0: Right.

289
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:25,177
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, they're restarting, but they're not completely restarting right from nothing.

290
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:25,760
Speaker 0: Right.

291
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:27,099
Speaker 0: But they're sort of restarting.

292
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,720
Speaker 0: So it's like theoretically, if you've never read the comic before, you should be able to read this comic.

293
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,679
Speaker 0: But that's not like they're throwing all the history away in the incinerator.

294
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:37,599
Speaker 0: At the same time, they're doing something else.

295
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:43,620
Speaker 0: And I'm not even going to bother talking about like which titles or who's drawing and writing which ones.

296
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:51,308
Speaker 0: The only one that I think is a big deal is the Jeff Johns, who I hate, and Jim Lee, who I like, are doing Justice League, which I think is like the big one.

297
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:51,994
Speaker 0: they're trying to push.

298
00:15:52,377 --> 00:16:01,880
Speaker 0: But anyway, they're going to also make every comic digital available on the same exact day that it's available on the newsstand.

299
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:03,290
Speaker 1: Oh, shit, son.

300
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,240
Speaker 0: For the same price.

301
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:06,839
Speaker 0: But there's no more details than that.

302
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,380
Speaker 0: There's probably going to be all sorts of DRM and whatever.

303
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:16,700
Speaker 1: This would have been a stupid idea a long time ago, but there are enough iPads and high resolution phones out to where you can look at color images like that and do OK.

304
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:23,859
Speaker 0: But anyway, and then like a couple of weeks after the comic comes out, it's going to go down from because the comics are going to be three dollars and so with the digital ones.

305
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:28,680
Speaker 0: But a couple of weeks when the comic becomes old, the digital one will go down in price to two dollars.

306
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,550
Speaker 0: So this is like it's.

307
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:33,620
Speaker 0: it's yet another example.

308
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:34,764
Speaker 0: Right.

309
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:42,264
Speaker 0: Of comic, you know, company that is was didn't update his business model for the digital age when it should have in nineteen ninety nine.

310
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:44,200
Speaker 0: It's currently twenty eleven.

311
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:47,019
Speaker 0: They're they're, you know, eleven years, twelve years too late.

312
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:52,540
Speaker 0: But most companies, the mistake they make is they dip the toe in the water.

313
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:53,811
Speaker 0: They say, oh, it didn't work.

314
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:54,840
Speaker 0: And they pull the toe out of the wall.

315
00:16:55,142 --> 00:17:01,040
Speaker 1: You realize the reason they do this is not because they're incompetent on that front, they're incompetent, but not in this specific way.

316
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,779
Speaker 1: It's not like they think these forays into the digital world, these toe dippings are going to work.

317
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,987
Speaker 1: They know they're going to fail.

318
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:08,579
Speaker 1: They're engineered to fail.

319
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,040
Speaker 1: They set them up to where they tip in a little bit and then it fails.

320
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Speaker 1: And they can go back to all the people who matter and say, look, it doesn't work.

321
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,397
Speaker 1: Nobody can do this.

322
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:20,640
Speaker 1: And they're trying to make sure that nobody ever does it except steam.

323
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,579
Speaker 0: iTunes all do it just fine.

324
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:24,040
Speaker 1: What superhero comics are doing.

325
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,301
Speaker 1: Right.

326
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:25,634
Speaker 0: But but anyway, the point is this.

327
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,480
Speaker 0: I got to commend them while simultaneously admonishing them.

328
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:29,702
Speaker 0: Right.

329
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,779
Speaker 0: I commend them because this is not a toe dip.

330
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,073
Speaker 0: This is a foot dip.

331
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:33,620
Speaker 0: Right.

332
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,034
Speaker 0: Or maybe a down to the knee.

333
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:35,640
Speaker 0: Right.

334
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:41,016
Speaker 0: It's like maybe you're sitting on the edge of the pool and you put both feet in and you're you're thinking about sliding off the edge.

335
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:41,580
Speaker 0: Right.

336
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:47,419
Speaker 0: So it's like they're making a bigger move for the modern world than anyone has ever done before.

337
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:47,600
Speaker 0: Right.

338
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,300
Speaker 0: They're resetting everything to number one.

339
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:50,476
Speaker 0: That's you know, I like that.

340
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,096
Speaker 0: Making the comics more accessible, if not completely accessible.

341
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:54,800
Speaker 0: Right.

342
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,580
Speaker 0: They're making it digital, available on the same day.

343
00:17:58,221 --> 00:17:58,859
Speaker 0: That's all great.

344
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,440
Speaker 0: But I can still have to admonish them because it's not far enough.

345
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,634
Speaker 0: Here's what they should do.

346
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:05,040
Speaker 0: Ready?

347
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,040
Speaker 0: Number one, forget about the frickin issues entirely.

348
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:10,860
Speaker 0: Only digital comics.

349
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,155
Speaker 1: They should try it out now.

350
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:12,439
Speaker 1: Why?

351
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,440
Speaker 1: Because they're going to make money off of it from the nerd trades only.

352
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:17,580
Speaker 1: Why not just make the money off the nerds?

353
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,699
Speaker 1: It doesn't cost you anything to do.

354
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:19,780
Speaker 1: It's just guaranteed profit.

355
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,579
Speaker 0: Because they don't make that much money off the nerds.

356
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:22,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they make something.

357
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,519
Speaker 1: The other the other rationale they probably will come up with is that that would end all comic book stores.

358
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,868
Speaker 0: That's a tough shipper.

359
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:29,738
Speaker 0: That doesn't matter to DC.

360
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:39,760
Speaker 0: This is already crushing the comic book stores, because every single person who switches away from comics to digital is now giving their three dollars directly to DC, bypassing the retailer.

361
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,260
Speaker 0: This already really hurts comic book stores.

362
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,840
Speaker 1: I don't think it does, because the primary audience currently of comic books are people who buy them because they're collecting.

363
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,740
Speaker 0: But then why the reset to number one?

364
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,720
Speaker 0: Clearly, that is an appeal to the masses.

365
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:55,439
Speaker 1: It is, perhaps, but I don't know how successful it will be.

366
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,940
Speaker 0: And plus resetting to number one like this.

367
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:05,100
Speaker 0: If you look online at the sort of the fan reactions on many forums, I've looked at two or three and I've looked at comment threads on a couple of comic news sites.

368
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:06,788
Speaker 0: It's really mixed.

369
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:08,500
Speaker 0: Like you can't even measure it.

370
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,659
Speaker 0: There's some people who are like, well, I'm done reading DC Comics now.

371
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:12,577
Speaker 0: And there's other people.

372
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

373
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:14,180
Speaker 1: And then other people.

374
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,720
Speaker 1: Dude in your Green Lantern underwear and Green Lantern sheets, who has every Green Lantern ever.

375
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is what drove you to quit.

376
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:20,939
Speaker 1: I'm sure.

377
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,820
Speaker 0: But you know, the thing is, you'd be surprised.

378
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,260
Speaker 0: These people do actually, right?

379
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,066
Speaker 0: When Spider-Man...

380
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:25,511
Speaker 1: No, they don't.

381
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:26,420
Speaker 1: They keep buying it.

382
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:34,914
Speaker 0: No, you'd be surprised when Spider-Man had that thing a while ago where they took away, where they, you know, revealed who he was and then unrevealed who he was.

383
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:35,035
Speaker 0: Right.

384
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,980
Speaker 0: The sales on Spider-Man, there are tons of fanboys stopped buying it and other people started buying it.

385
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,080
Speaker 0: It was like this big shift.

386
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:47,999
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, the new people are going to come in and start reading it and other people are going to stop reading it.

387
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,440
Speaker 0: And there are the fanboys who keep reading it no matter what.

388
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,959
Speaker 0: But there are a lot of half fanboys who, you know, they can, they change what they do.

389
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,200
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll stop buying one comic, start buying another.

390
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:00,060
Speaker 0: You know, they're buying, they're going to buy a comic.

391
00:20:00,642 --> 00:20:02,840
Speaker 0: But what comic they buy is up in the air, right?

392
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,893
Speaker 1: I do think the loser in all this in the long run, though, will be the comic book stores.

393
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:07,400
Speaker 0: Oh, definitely.

394
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,619
Speaker 0: Comic book stores lose no matter what.

395
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:11,100
Speaker 1: The thing is, comic book stores and gaming stores are in the same boot.

396
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:11,970
Speaker 1: In that boat.

397
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:12,760
Speaker 1: Das Boot.

398
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,840
Speaker 1: In that neither one of them is getting the presence it used to, partly because people are buying stuff online.

399
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't buy board games digitally.

400
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:20,940
Speaker 1: But you know what?

401
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,699
Speaker 1: Amazon is cheaper than any gaming store I've ever been into.

402
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,203
Speaker 1: Yeah.

403
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:24,579
Speaker 0: And you know what?

404
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,519
Speaker 0: What if, you know, if Wii U was something that you were going to buy?

405
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,480
Speaker 0: We'll talk about Wii U and some Tuesday in the future.

406
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:30,264
Speaker 1: Oh, Wii U.

407
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:33,260
Speaker 0: And what if there were actual real board games on Wii U?

408
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,140
Speaker 0: Would that hurt sales of physical board games?

409
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:38,680
Speaker 1: See, it's hard to say because that's just an example.

410
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,900
Speaker 1: Because board games are kind of the same thing as comics.

411
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:51,260
Speaker 1: The people who care about European style, you know, hardcore German board games are the same kind of nerd, like the same type as the hardcore comic book fans.

412
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:59,160
Speaker 0: All I'm saying is that if they don't want any admonishment from Scott Rubin, what they have to do is they have to make the reset an actual reset.

413
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:06,860
Speaker 0: Throw away all of the history of all of the superheroes and never, ever, ever, ever go back to it.

414
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,180
Speaker 0: Make it completely gone, set on fire.

415
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,360
Speaker 0: Not, OK, we'll change the costumes and we'll change some things and keep it familiar.

416
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,960
Speaker 0: No, get rid of it entirely.

417
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,418
Speaker 0: So it never comes back.

418
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,920
Speaker 0: Number two thing they have to do to remove all admonishment.

419
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:25,000
Speaker 0: Don't charge me three dollars for a fucking digital comic.

420
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,367
Speaker 0: Netflix pricing, right?

421
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,600
Speaker 0: At the current pricing, three dollars a comic.

422
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:29,645
Speaker 1: Oh, duh.

423
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:35,640
Speaker 1: If there was a Netflix of comics, you just subscribe to Spider-Man for twelve bucks a year or whatever.

424
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:36,102
Speaker 1: Yup.

425
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:40,580
Speaker 0: For even if I wait and buy these digital comics at two dollars each.

426
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,201
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

427
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:46,320
Speaker 0: If they have fifty two titles, I would pay ten bucks a month, one hundred and twenty dollars a year.

428
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:53,872
Speaker 0: If that meant that I could read every DC comic ever, whenever I wanted it, any device ever with no DRMs, I would pay one hundred and twenty dollars a year.

429
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:54,459
Speaker 0: And you know what?

430
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:56,111
Speaker 0: I'm paying them zero right now.

431
00:21:56,454 --> 00:21:57,320
Speaker 0: That's one hundred and twenty.

432
00:21:57,461 --> 00:21:58,180
Speaker 1: I'd go a little further.

433
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,739
Speaker 0: It doesn't cost them anything because they're only giving me digital copies, which cost them nothing.

434
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,499
Speaker 0: Now, if I were that many people would pay that one hundred and twenty dollars, I guarantee at least a million people would pay one hundred and twenty dollars a year.

435
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,159
Speaker 0: That's a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.

436
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:26,360
Speaker 1: And I would basically what I would do is, you know, the new comics, I'll go into this, but I'd make the price a little a lot higher, maybe double, triple, but I'd sell it on digitizing the entire backlog and putting all of those up for free.

437
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,779
Speaker 0: See, I was just talking one hundred and twenty dollars a year for starting at these number ones.

438
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:39,419
Speaker 0: If you're going to give me the entire history of DC Comics, all the way back to Action Comics number one or even earlier and all the new stuff, I pay two, three hundred a year.

439
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:46,620
Speaker 0: If that meant always have all the access to everything forever, you know, like that forever, forever.

440
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,283
Speaker 0: Yes.

441
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:50,160
Speaker 0: Unless I don't pay my three hundred dollars, then you can cut me off.

442
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,075
Speaker 0: But you know the point.

443
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:51,279
Speaker 0: Right.

444
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:53,031
Speaker 0: But yeah, they need to do that.

445
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:53,920
Speaker 0: Then I'll be impressed.

446
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,740
Speaker 1: So speaking of comic book shops being driven out of business, Kevin Smith wants to do something and I'm going to quote the article.

447
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,017
Speaker 0: He owns some comic shops, doesn't he?

448
00:23:01,602 --> 00:23:05,360
Speaker 1: So he wants to do, and it looks like he is doing, they did a casting call.

449
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,059
Speaker 1: Everything's pretty much going along.

450
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,890
Speaker 1: Reality show.

451
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,679
Speaker 0: You mean game show?

452
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:11,559
Speaker 1: About a comic book store.

453
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:12,188
Speaker 0: All right.

454
00:23:12,229 --> 00:23:12,740
Speaker 0: What's it about?

455
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:17,220
Speaker 1: The day to day goings on of a comic book store.

456
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:17,845
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's not.

457
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,160
Speaker 0: it is actually a reality show.

458
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,320
Speaker 0: It's just going to be like, watch what happens in this comic book store.

459
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:22,742
Speaker 1: Yeah.

460
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:24,340
Speaker 1: Watch what happens in this comic book store.

461
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,543
Speaker 1: Now, I can I can spoil the first season of this because I've been in comic book stores.

462
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:30,880
Speaker 1: It's mostly very quiet.

463
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:34,120
Speaker 0: But but the thing is, it's going to be his comic book store probably.

464
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,442
Speaker 0: Right.

465
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:35,960
Speaker 0: Which is actually a pretty nice shop.

466
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:36,321
Speaker 0: Yes.

467
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,540
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, yeah, it's sort of like Midtown Comics.

468
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:38,804
Speaker 0: Right.

469
00:23:38,824 --> 00:23:39,413
Speaker 0: It's very nice.

470
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:39,839
Speaker 0: Yeah.

471
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:41,200
Speaker 0: Or Forbidden Planet.

472
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,529
Speaker 1: You've been to Midtown Comics.

473
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,800
Speaker 1: What's usually going on in there?

474
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:48,020
Speaker 1: It's quiet and there's like 20 nerds looking at stuff quietly.

475
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:49,463
Speaker 0: Yeah.

476
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:51,659
Speaker 0: But the thing is, because this is going to be a TV show.

477
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're going to get.

478
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:56,559
Speaker 1: they're going to get personalities in there and they're going to get them to argue about stuff and do, you know.

479
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,639
Speaker 0: Plus, nerds will go in there intentionally thinking they're going to be on TV.

480
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:00,604
Speaker 1: Of course.

481
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:03,820
Speaker 0: And when this event's like a free comic book day, stuff will happen.

482
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,226
Speaker 1: I'm just I'm not there.

483
00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:07,140
Speaker 0: Imagine gathering tournaments.

484
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,460
Speaker 1: I'm not feeling this too much.

485
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,740
Speaker 0: Plus, they're going to stage a lot of things to happen in there.

486
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,357
Speaker 0: You know, they'll have creators coming to do signings and they'll be.

487
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,750
Speaker 0: they'll talk to people, you know, they'll.

488
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,620
Speaker 0: they'll interview people about what they're buying.

489
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:22,660
Speaker 0: You could you could do this for 12 episodes, I think.

490
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:26,780
Speaker 1: The thing is, this would be better off not being on TV, being a YouTube show.

491
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,440
Speaker 0: Actually, there is a web comic if I written by a guy who works in a comic shop.

492
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:39,420
Speaker 0: And basically whenever a customer says something really stupid, he makes a like a one or one panel or three panel comic of whatever stupid thing the customer said.

493
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:40,980
Speaker 0: It is hilarious.

494
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:44,460
Speaker 0: I forget what it is, but I'm going to try to find it and get a link out there.

495
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,040
Speaker 0: But that is what the the reality show should be.

496
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:59,779
Speaker 0: If you show all the moronic customers saying stupid shit like they say in that comic, that'll be a winner because to actually see the people's faces and to see them saying that while the camera's pointed at them.

497
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:01,952
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

498
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:03,040
Speaker 0: That would double the hilarity.

499
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,420
Speaker 0: And the comic is already literally, laugh out loud, hilarious.

500
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,140
Speaker 1: Now, to quote the article, because this really sums up what this is all about.

501
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,598
Speaker 1: I'm just quoting the last sentence here.

502
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:21,762
Speaker 1: Regardless, it'll be nice to see Smith pushes boundaries and get out of his comfort zone by finally doing a project centering on a couple of dudes making pop culture references.

503
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,960
Speaker 1: So I got one more little thing that I just happen to see.

504
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:34,680
Speaker 1: You know, there's this whole foreskin circumcision debate going on, San Diego campaign to ban it and whatever.

505
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,240
Speaker 0: But I'm indifferent on that whole issue.

506
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,847
Speaker 0: I abstain.

507
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:37,740
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not indifferent.

508
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:39,278
Speaker 1: I'm actually yeah, I'm torn.

509
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,103
Speaker 0: I abstain.

510
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:42,520
Speaker 1: I'm ambivalent, but weakly ambivalent.

511
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:51,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, because ambivalent implies, you know, ambivalent that I've got like you like you could be ambivalent by having two very powerful opposing opinions that you can't reconcile.

512
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:56,800
Speaker 1: But in this case, I'm ambivalent in that I have like one weak argument for and like one weak argument against.

513
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,117
Speaker 0: I've got I've got like medium arguments on both sides and they're not.

514
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:03,580
Speaker 0: they're not principles that I hold very close to, like far away principles.

515
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,120
Speaker 1: So I noticed this article is anti circumcision comic, anti Semitic.

516
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:14,597
Speaker 1: There's a comic force within it, so there's a comic foreskin man.

517
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:15,664
Speaker 1: that's about this debate.

518
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:17,560
Speaker 1: I was going to fight to save people's foreskin.

519
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:26,240
Speaker 1: And this article, you know, I just saw that like the headline and I saw like a first sentence or so of it and I'm like, all right, probably not.

520
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:36,140
Speaker 1: It's probably just pro foreskin and someone's making a leap that, yeah, because a Jewish tradition is to circumcise boys, that obviously it's anti Semitic.

521
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,226
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, yeah.

522
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:38,960
Speaker 1: And I was going to brush it off.

523
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:43,059
Speaker 1: So then I click on the article and you know what's on the cover of the second one.

524
00:26:43,761 --> 00:27:01,360
Speaker 1: So here's foreskin man, Aryan, beautiful, blonde hair, chiseled behind him is what I can only describe as the stereotypical Jew with horrible razor blades ready to circumcise a baby against the wishes of the mother.

525
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,119
Speaker 1: And there's like the Jewish Hasidic mafia behind him.

526
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,749
Speaker 0: So it is.

527
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:05,138
Speaker 0: So it is.

528
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:08,125
Speaker 0: Then why is there even a?

529
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:16,575
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, usually when the title of the article is is X anti Semitic, you expect to see something that's questionable.

530
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:21,480
Speaker 1: like if a headline ever says is X, Y, that headline is bullshit and that article is bullshit.

531
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,122
Speaker 0: I know.

532
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:27,340
Speaker 0: But the point is, is except in this case with a headline like that, you would think it would be a questionable situation.

533
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,960
Speaker 0: It's like it's like, huh, is this gay?

534
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:38,407
Speaker 0: And you open it up and the show tunes and penises and, you know, it's like, gee, no, I don't know.

535
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:39,559
Speaker 0: But now look at this picture.

536
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,361
Speaker 0: Maybe.

537
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,170
Speaker 1: OK, it's it's pretty great.

538
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:49,789
Speaker 1: So I'll leave it at that.

539
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,513
Speaker 1: You know what?

540
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:53,530
Speaker 1: This comic probably is a little anti Semitic.

541
00:27:54,352 --> 00:28:02,689
Speaker 0: The name of the web comic about the comic book shop, which is still updated as recently as today, is called Our Valued Customers and I will link to it.

542
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,497
Speaker 1: So things of the day, it's, you know, summer.

543
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:13,739
Speaker 1: ish.

544
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:21,340
Speaker 1: This is right around that time of year when a lot of high school seniors and people like that skip school to go to amusement parks, ride some roller coasters.

545
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:21,902
Speaker 1: Yeah.

546
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,380
Speaker 1: And I thought we'd done a show on roller coasters.

547
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,825
Speaker 0: I thought we did also.

548
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:30,526
Speaker 1: I could not find it after like 10 minutes of digging around our listeners.

549
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:31,620
Speaker 0: Go tell us if we did one.

550
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,720
Speaker 0: I have a feeling it might have been a show you recorded and did not post.

551
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,000
Speaker 1: That's possible.

552
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:36,805
Speaker 1: Yeah.

553
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:37,779
Speaker 1: Or the search is broken.

554
00:28:39,063 --> 00:28:39,652
Speaker 0: Less likely.

555
00:28:39,957 --> 00:28:40,140
Speaker 1: Yeah.

556
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:46,423
Speaker 1: So, you know, we were talking to in the forum recently about geekeries that you grow out of.

557
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:47,680
Speaker 1: And there's a whole debate there.

558
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:55,940
Speaker 1: But one geekery I kind of grew out of, partly just because I am an adult and have access to much more exciting and worldly things because I have more money.

559
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:02,200
Speaker 1: But when I was a kid, you know, middle school, high school, I was a suit like I would consider myself a roller coaster nerd.

560
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,560
Speaker 1: Like I knew the intimate motherfucking details about roller coasters.

561
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,646
Speaker 1: You take me to Cedar Point.

562
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:08,720
Speaker 1: I can tell you when the roller coasters were built.

563
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:14,199
Speaker 1: I can tell you about like, well, that's technically, you know, that's a wooden looking coaster, but technically it's a steel coaster because the rails are like this.

564
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,920
Speaker 1: And yeah, so really into roller coasters.

565
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:26,440
Speaker 1: And I was looking around online trying to figure out, like, all right, it's been about a decade since I've ridden a real roller coaster.

566
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,439
Speaker 0: You got to go to international roller coaster database.

567
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:32,259
Speaker 1: Except for that one roller coaster we rode that one year in Wildwood, which was OK.

568
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:36,560
Speaker 0: You know, I mean, it was OK for not having ridden a roller coaster in a long time.

569
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,939
Speaker 1: It was like a three out of 10 roller coaster that got a plus five bonus for the fact that I had ridden a roller coaster in half a decade.

570
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,642
Speaker 0: Yep.

571
00:29:42,662 --> 00:29:49,740
Speaker 1: And minus one hundred bonus from costing ten bucks to ride one minus another one, because remember that year that was when I had Lyme disease and didn't know it yet.

572
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,478
Speaker 1: So I had a wicked headache the whole time.

573
00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:55,260
Speaker 0: It's only minus one, but the ten bucks was more minus.

574
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:55,943
Speaker 1: Yeah.

575
00:29:55,964 --> 00:29:57,538
Speaker 1: Ten bucks back then meant a lot to me.

576
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:07,760
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day is a POV of what I consider to this day, there may be a better roller coaster, at least a better contiguous roller coaster.

577
00:30:08,104 --> 00:30:09,440
Speaker 0: The best roller coaster you've ridden.

578
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:09,900
Speaker 1: Yes.

579
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:24,240
Speaker 1: Now, I argue this partly because people have made taller and faster roller coasters, but this is a contiguous closed circuit steel coaster as opposed to the kind of BS cheating coaster that's really big, but basically shoots you up one big thing and over it.

580
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,863
Speaker 1: And that's it.

581
00:30:24,883 --> 00:30:25,044
Speaker 0: Yeah.

582
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:28,388
Speaker 0: You know, it's sort of like, you know, it's like a drag, you know, some cars.

583
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:29,137
Speaker 0: It's funny.

584
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,095
Speaker 0: Isn't the name of that real dragster drag?

585
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,060
Speaker 0: It's like a drag racing car.

586
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:36,360
Speaker 0: It's like let's make a car that goes straight really fast.

587
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:36,703
Speaker 0: Great.

588
00:30:36,744 --> 00:30:37,480
Speaker 0: But it can't turn.

589
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,619
Speaker 0: An F1 car is much more impressive, right?

590
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:45,141
Speaker 0: Even though it might not have a top speed as high as the drag car, it can turn and it's useful.

591
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:51,800
Speaker 1: But there are many different styles of roller coasters and like wooden coasters and steel coasters and different kinds of steel, whatever.

592
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,600
Speaker 1: But the Millennium Force at Cedar Point is a particular kind of steel coaster.

593
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,940
Speaker 1: A similar coasters would be like the Magnum XL 200, which was also at Cedar Point.

594
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:12,320
Speaker 1: The steel coaster that has one very tall, very straight hill, and then it has a lot of very high up and downs, not doesn't go upside down and a lot of turn left and rights.

595
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:12,821
Speaker 1: Yep.

596
00:31:12,861 --> 00:31:15,000
Speaker 1: But usually the turn left and right is minimized.

597
00:31:15,261 --> 00:31:19,740
Speaker 1: And the biggest thing is it'll have like three huge hills and rapid succession.

598
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:23,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe it's a combination of hills and turns and banked turns.

599
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:37,080
Speaker 1: Their primary benefits are high top speed, coupled with very strong sideways and top wise Gs, especially at the peak of the second hill of a coaster like this, you'll pretty much like if you don't have your seatbelt on, you're dead.

600
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,421
Speaker 0: Yeah.

601
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:39,900
Speaker 0: Those are my favorite types of roller coasters, hands down.

602
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,019
Speaker 1: Because now I used to be, you know, it's too bad there's no YouTube.

603
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:43,579
Speaker 0: I actually want a really good one.

604
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,124
Speaker 0: It's not as high or as fast, but there is a Superman roller coaster at Six Flags New England.

605
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:49,099
Speaker 1: I've heard Superman's OK.

606
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,285
Speaker 0: It is it is quite good.

607
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:51,852
Speaker 0: It's about 100 feet less than the Millennium Force.

608
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:53,800
Speaker 0: So

609
00:31:53,820 --> 00:32:10,497
Speaker 1: the Millennium Force has been voted so many times by various kind of international and national roller coaster organizations as the best steel coaster in the world that I find it hard for anyone to argue to me that there is, in fact, a better roller coaster, at least a better contiguous closed loop steel rail coaster, which

610
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:11,200
Speaker 0: is my favorite kind.

611
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:11,640
Speaker 1: Yes.

612
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:17,063
Speaker 1: So the Millennium Force POV, if anyone knows of a better coaster, I dare you to tell me.

613
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:18,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are higher there.

614
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:19,245
Speaker 0: Look at this.

615
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:20,980
Speaker 0: But they do not have as much action.

616
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,979
Speaker 1: When this was built, it was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world.

617
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:25,782
Speaker 1: Yeah.

618
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:34,659
Speaker 1: And when it was built, its third peak, the third highest part of it was taller than the Magnum XL two hundred's highest peak.

619
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:40,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a pretty damn good coaster is to this day the longest steel roller coaster in the world as well.

620
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:40,798
Speaker 1: Yeah.

621
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:42,798
Speaker 0: So I got a really good thing today.

622
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:43,565
Speaker 0: You do?

623
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:44,051
Speaker 0: Yeah.

624
00:32:44,071 --> 00:32:44,780
Speaker 0: It's hockey related.

625
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,660
Speaker 0: So we tend to look down on people who are sort of the drunken frat guys.

626
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:55,346
Speaker 1: Only because, you know, the only reason I ever looked down on someone like that because you're fucking loud.

627
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:58,040
Speaker 0: But they're also pretty much the opposite of geeks.

628
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,560
Speaker 0: Right.

629
00:32:59,003 --> 00:33:08,660
Speaker 1: But at least these guys, how do you know they're not geeks like they're really into how you know, they're not at home with like three different red solo cups, like training and practicing because beer pong.

630
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:14,424
Speaker 0: If this game of beer pong odds are one guy is actually a beer pong geek and the other guys are just want to get drunk.

631
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:19,003
Speaker 0: And, you know, you could be a getting drunk geek, but you know what?

632
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:21,319
Speaker 0: If you're doing it with Bud Light, you're not a getting drunk geek.

633
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:24,239
Speaker 1: No, you're getting drunk geek, but you're not a beer geek.

634
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,759
Speaker 0: That's like saying you're a video game geek and all you ever play is Mario.

635
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,249
Speaker 1: You're not even getting drunk geek because getting drunk geeks know that Vodak is the way to go.

636
00:33:32,371 --> 00:33:32,780
Speaker 0: I know that.

637
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,599
Speaker 0: Or perhaps gin.

638
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:41,585
Speaker 0: The point is, here is an epic tale of some hockey Canadian hockey geeks who are fans of the Vancouver Canucks.

639
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:44,320
Speaker 0: This is one of the most epic tales I've ever read.

640
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,100
Speaker 0: It involves, I'm not going to tell you the story because then what's the point?

641
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,880
Speaker 0: You have to read it for yourself to get the full effect.

642
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,999
Speaker 0: But it involves, right, a one thousand mile road trip from Vancouver to L.A.

643
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,120
Speaker 0: to see a hockey game or San Jose to see a hockey game.

644
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,461
Speaker 0: Sorry.

645
00:33:58,681 --> 00:34:16,760
Speaker 0: The Sharks and Jose getting so drunk, you end up in the hospital drinking some of those alcoholic beverages with the owner of the Canucks and his hot ladies going back to Vancouver, escaping the hospital and many other epic things happening.

646
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:20,239
Speaker 0: It is so epic and it's all true.

647
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,639
Speaker 0: One hundred percent true photo evidence, not Snopes, not bullshit.

648
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,960
Speaker 0: It really happened, as is told in this article.

649
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,228
Speaker 0: One hundred percent.

650
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:29,300
Speaker 0: I confirmed it.

651
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,108
Speaker 0: It's for real.

652
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:31,120
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

653
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:35,806
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing that you'd see in a movie and you would be like, oh, that's a stupid movie.

654
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:36,699
Speaker 1: It's like contrived.

655
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,739
Speaker 0: Similar things have happened to us.

656
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:50,280
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, oh, remember that, you know, when we were driving back from Otacon and we needed to get off the highway in the dark to get gas, you know, and like, this is like one of those stories times a hundred.

657
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,800
Speaker 1: Our midget hookers playing settlers really doesn't even come close.

658
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,219
Speaker 0: It's like that times 20.

659
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:56,322
Speaker 0: Right.

660
00:34:56,382 --> 00:34:57,159
Speaker 0: It's that awesome.

661
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,960
Speaker 0: So check out this story of epic epicness.

662
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,404
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is still Isaac Asimov's foundation.

663
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:08,019
Speaker 1: The unofficial book club book is still all of the R. Scout Backer, Prince of Nothing books.

664
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:10,920
Speaker 1: We will not be at Otacon because they didn't invite us back.

665
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:12,597
Speaker 1: So you can tell them if you want us to be there.

666
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,219
Speaker 1: PEX will be at Connecticut is coming up.

667
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,778
Speaker 1: We'll be there running the panel's department.

668
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:20,689
Speaker 0: E-commerce room.

669
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:21,920
Speaker 1: that's coming along.

670
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,404
Speaker 0: We're pretty sure.

671
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:23,980
Speaker 0: you said you were going to mail the things tomorrow.

672
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:24,723
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

673
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:28,521
Speaker 1: Oh, and the only new update on the e-commerce is that we're almost out of shirts.

674
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:33,397
Speaker 0: But I thought you said after a previous show that you were going to mail something the following day.

675
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:33,599
Speaker 1: Yeah.

676
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:34,368
Speaker 0: Did you do that?

677
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:34,651
Speaker 1: Yeah.

678
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:35,218
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

679
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:35,804
Speaker 0: What do you?

680
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:36,959
Speaker 1: that's why it's not a news.

681
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,040
Speaker 0: I'm just verifying that you mailed like you said you would.

682
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,149
Speaker 0: There was a non shit talk.

683
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:42,560
Speaker 0: That is a news when it comes to RIV.

684
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:43,532
Speaker 0: A non shit talk.

685
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:44,160
Speaker 0: Oh, my gosh.

686
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,922
Speaker 1: Speaking of non shit talks, you might have noticed we launched a new spin off front row.

687
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:50,960
Speaker 1: Crew geek night show called Radio Free Equestria.

688
00:35:51,922 --> 00:35:59,319
Speaker 1: It is about nothing but my little pony friendship is magic and the intimate Gandalf girthings that are going on there in.

689
00:35:59,661 --> 00:35:59,802
Speaker 1: Yep.

690
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:04,239
Speaker 1: I think it's a pretty good show, actually, and it's going to go up pretty much weekly for a while, at least pilots.

691
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,452
Speaker 0: Brony seemed to like it.

692
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:05,939
Speaker 1: Yep.

693
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,800
Speaker 0: Well, I was I was worried.

694
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,980
Speaker 0: I was you know, I didn't know what the reaction was going to be, but Brony's actually were excited for more.

695
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,564
Speaker 0: I was like, really?

696
00:36:12,664 --> 00:36:12,966
Speaker 0: OK.

697
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:14,960
Speaker 1: The reaction was pretty overwhelming, actually.

698
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,605
Speaker 0: From Brony's.

699
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:15,909
Speaker 0: Yeah.

700
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,820
Speaker 0: I don't know about normal people.

701
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,924
Speaker 1: We have more list, more viewers of this at its start than geek nights had for like the first year.

702
00:36:22,205 --> 00:36:25,440
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's it's a targeted community effort.

703
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

704
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:27,760
Speaker 1: We got to do more targeted community efforts.

705
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,100
Speaker 0: Well, that was always the strategy.

706
00:36:29,201 --> 00:36:31,640
Speaker 0: We just haven't found enough communities that are ripe for targeting.

707
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:38,599
Speaker 1: So to put another thing out there, like I said before, there is a another a third thing that we are working on.

708
00:36:39,002 --> 00:36:40,932
Speaker 1: I don't know when it'll be up, but it's it's coming.

709
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:47,780
Speaker 1: We have a third show unrelated to ponies and not directly related to geek nights that will also be on YouTube.

710
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,880
Speaker 1: So keep an eye out on my YouTube channel, Geek Nights Rim.

711
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,279
Speaker 1: So we got two shows for you, but one of them we haven't seen a lot of.

712
00:36:56,641 --> 00:37:01,240
Speaker 1: And we're going to talk about fairly briefly, just because it's something kind of different and cute and neat.

713
00:37:01,341 --> 00:37:04,400
Speaker 1: And we're always a big fan of those kind of short, cute anime.

714
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:13,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're big on the the animes that are, you know, made up a lot of short tiny episodes like Damakoto and such, because it doesn't take that much effort to watch them.

715
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,739
Speaker 0: And if you have a short attention span, you can totally burn through it really quick.

716
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:19,459
Speaker 0: And, you know, risky safety really got us hooked.

717
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:20,322
Speaker 1: Yeah.

718
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:23,820
Speaker 1: So Hippyra, the little vampire, or I guess vampire.

719
00:37:24,783 --> 00:37:25,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not.

720
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:31,920
Speaker 0: You know, I know vampires are a thing lately, but it, you know, which sort of, you know, it's annoying like, oh, another vampire thing.

721
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,299
Speaker 1: Oh, you're mad because someone else likes something.

722
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:37,120
Speaker 1: This bothers you that someone else is a fan of something.

723
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:41,022
Speaker 0: No, I'm just saying it's like, you know, when they're seen, there was like a zombie.

724
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:43,560
Speaker 1: Vampires were cool before other people were into.

725
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:47,060
Speaker 0: No, I'm just saying there was a zombie glut and then there was a vampire glut.

726
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:50,036
Speaker 0: And it's and it's like, well, you would you would think, oh, it's.

727
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:55,520
Speaker 0: you think, right, maybe if there's another when any new thing comes out during a glut.

728
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:55,862
Speaker 0: Right.

729
00:37:55,902 --> 00:38:00,997
Speaker 0: And it wasn't the thing that inspired the glut or kicked it off like Walking Dead kicked off the zombie glut.

730
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:01,340
Speaker 0: Right.

731
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:04,720
Speaker 0: But so a lot of other things just came in from the side.

732
00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:08,020
Speaker 0: And it's like, OK, obviously you didn't put a lot of effort into this.

733
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,559
Speaker 0: You're just trying to ride the wave.

734
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,586
Speaker 0: So you would think a new vampire thing coming out in a vampire glut is just trying to ride the wave.

735
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:17,780
Speaker 0: But you'd be skeptical that it actually has merit.

736
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,323
Speaker 1: There's one thing that makes this kind of stand out, a little one tidbit that you might not notice.

737
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:25,940
Speaker 1: The story is done by one Katsuhiro Otomo.

738
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,069
Speaker 0: Oh, the Akira guy?

739
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Akira guy.

740
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,200
Speaker 0: Yes, he just wrote the story, though he didn't animate it or anything else.

741
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:42,179
Speaker 1: It was directed by some other guy, not a huge cast of people working on it, because it's a short, cute little show about a little vampire boy in a place where the sun never rises.

742
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically it's.

743
00:38:44,266 --> 00:38:46,959
Speaker 0: it's a vampire town named like Salta.

744
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:47,481
Speaker 0: Right.

745
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:49,980
Speaker 0: And he's a cute little vampire guy.

746
00:38:50,221 --> 00:38:51,719
Speaker 0: He lives in the cute little vampire town.

747
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,706
Speaker 0: All the little vampires.

748
00:38:52,726 --> 00:39:03,480
Speaker 1: He has a friend that's a soul because one of his one of the adults in the village collected hundreds of thousands of human souls and tried to mash them together into something he could bite so he could go to hell, because hell is heaven for vampires.

749
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,167
Speaker 0: That's right.

750
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:04,999
Speaker 1: And he fucked it up.

751
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,240
Speaker 1: And one little leg of his soul popped out and is hanging around with Hippy Ra.

752
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:08,922
Speaker 0: Yep.

753
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:10,840
Speaker 1: And there's not much else to say.

754
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,780
Speaker 1: It's just kind of cute, goonie.

755
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,145
Speaker 0: And yeah, it's not.

756
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:21,360
Speaker 0: it's usually the shows that are really short like this have just really intense, strong jokes.

757
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,446
Speaker 0: They they come hitting hard with the comedy nonstop because they've only got like five minutes.

758
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:26,900
Speaker 1: This is more slice of life.

759
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:28,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a little quieter.

760
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,699
Speaker 1: I guess slice of death.

761
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,833
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, undeath.

762
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,660
Speaker 0: But it's like cute, funny.

763
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:33,042
Speaker 0: Right.

764
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:37,220
Speaker 0: And all the funniness is just like seeing how the cute vampire world works.

765
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,020
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, I got myself some blood orange juice.

766
00:39:40,202 --> 00:39:41,779
Speaker 0: It's like, lol, blood orange juice.

767
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:43,376
Speaker 0: OK, it's cute.

768
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:46,240
Speaker 0: Oh, we got to take biting lessons in school.

769
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:47,919
Speaker 1: I love taking biting lessons.

770
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,479
Speaker 0: You know, it's stuff like that.

771
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:55,220
Speaker 1: It's not like or like the subway pulls up and there's some people sitting and then there's some people who are bats hanging from the straps.

772
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:57,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's all environmental.

773
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,260
Speaker 0: Like what would happen in a friendly vampire town?

774
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:00,641
Speaker 0: Funny.

775
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:04,180
Speaker 0: It's not like Domic Adobutu where they come hitting hard with drunk unicorns.

776
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:05,185
Speaker 1: Right.

777
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:06,119
Speaker 1: Drunk unicorns.

778
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,759
Speaker 1: It's just sort of, you know, someone's got to mash up My Little Pony and Domic Adobutu.

779
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,884
Speaker 0: Not a bad choice.

780
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,220
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know, the show is really short.

781
00:40:15,823 --> 00:40:17,559
Speaker 0: It's all CG, but it's pretty good.

782
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:21,280
Speaker 0: But the download, the quality of the downloads hurts it quite a bit.

783
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,679
Speaker 0: You have to find in higher resolution downloads than we had.

784
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:25,618
Speaker 0: But then again, the Mac Mini was pretty weak.

785
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:26,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, Cor Solo.

786
00:40:27,313 --> 00:40:27,880
Speaker 1: You can find it.

787
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,302
Speaker 1: It's cute.

788
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:36,320
Speaker 1: But our main topic tonight is the thing that, you know, after ponies ended in the Fur Roku forum, there's about how many thousand posts in that thread.

789
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,220
Speaker 1: But there's one other thread that's been kind of plugging along.

790
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,579
Speaker 1: There's like a hundred posts in it about wakfu.

791
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,423
Speaker 0: So I'm like, hey, there's a show that I've never heard of that has all these posts in a thread.

792
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:48,099
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe it's worth checking out.

793
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,007
Speaker 1: On Geek Nights a while ago, because I've been watching it with Emily and I've seen a decent amount of it.

794
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:53,360
Speaker 0: I've seen three or four episodes.

795
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,250
Speaker 1: It's OK.

796
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:55,020
Speaker 0: Yeah.

797
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,780
Speaker 0: I mean, like people made a thread about it.

798
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,120
Speaker 0: So I said, oh, I got to check that out to see what the deal is.

799
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:03,080
Speaker 0: So I checked it out and I was like, you know, I was like, well, it wasn't bad.

800
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:06,039
Speaker 0: But why are people getting so incredibly excited about it?

801
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,600
Speaker 1: Are they getting so incredibly excited about it?

802
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,203
Speaker 1: I don't think they are.

803
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:13,540
Speaker 1: I think they're excited about it at the same level that, say, people are like when we're watching Slayers way back.

804
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,779
Speaker 1: We just, oh, let's watch some more Slayers.

805
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Slayers is way better than wakfu.

806
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're similar genre at least.

807
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,020
Speaker 0: They are similar in genre.

808
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,020
Speaker 1: Is one of those like might as well be a game?

809
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,239
Speaker 1: Oh, well, it is a game, but we'll skip that for now.

810
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:36,920
Speaker 1: It's basically a generic JRPG style plot of a hero and his party going on adventures in a world that is surprisingly video game like.

811
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:37,867
Speaker 0: Yeah.

812
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:38,557
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

813
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:38,740
Speaker 0: Right.

814
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,496
Speaker 0: There was a game called Dofus, which is a Flash based MMO.

815
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,580
Speaker 1: It's the thing that Scott never noticed at all the gaming cons.

816
00:41:47,023 --> 00:41:48,271
Speaker 0: Yeah.

817
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:49,439
Speaker 0: And then.

818
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:50,002
Speaker 0: Right.

819
00:41:50,062 --> 00:41:53,580
Speaker 0: And that Dofus game had some sort of world that they created for.

820
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,003
Speaker 0: Right.

821
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:55,320
Speaker 0: So Wakfu was another.

822
00:41:56,481 --> 00:42:00,040
Speaker 0: It was basically Wakfu is an MMO Final Fantasy Tactics game.

823
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:00,524
Speaker 0: Right.

824
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,520
Speaker 0: That was in the same world as Dofus.

825
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,700
Speaker 0: So there's a video game that created a world.

826
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,980
Speaker 0: Then there was another video game, Wakfu, that took place in the same world.

827
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,501
Speaker 0: Right.

828
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:10,860
Speaker 0: So he's the same universe for two video games.

829
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,699
Speaker 0: And then what we're talking about today is an animated series based on.

830
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:16,423
Speaker 0: Right.

831
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:20,180
Speaker 0: The Wakfu game, which is placed in the same world as the Dofus game.

832
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:29,281
Speaker 0: So the first season of 26 episodes began airing in '08, according to Wikipedia, and new episodes continued into January 2010.

833
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:30,046
Speaker 0: And it's French.

834
00:42:30,388 --> 00:42:30,831
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

835
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:32,080
Speaker 0: is all this stuff is French.

836
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,205
Speaker 0: Right.

837
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:35,440
Speaker 0: The video games, all this stuff were made by French people.

838
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,119
Speaker 0: I think Square Enix actually is helping them publish.

839
00:42:39,582 --> 00:42:47,640
Speaker 0: All of the production for the TV show was done in Flash in France, except for I think two episodes are done in Japan, whatever that kind of stuff.

840
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,485
Speaker 0: Isn't that important?

841
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:50,640
Speaker 0: But yeah.

842
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,937
Speaker 0: And they're coming out with a season two.

843
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,640
Speaker 0: So the thing that's really impressive about the show is that it's all done in Flash.

844
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,200
Speaker 0: My Little Pony is also all done in Flash, but My Little Pony looks really impressive.

845
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,200
Speaker 0: Wakfu, if you just look at still shots, looks way more impressive than My Little Pony.

846
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,259
Speaker 0: It's like you look at My Little Pony and you're like, oh, my God, that's the best thing, the highest quality Flash animation I've ever seen.

847
00:43:12,942 --> 00:43:21,920
Speaker 0: But Wakfu is even better, except for the fact that he's personally, while the art and visual imagery is way better than ponies.

848
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,740
Speaker 0: I actually think the animation, the movement is a little jerky.

849
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:34,993
Speaker 1: Well, there's two things going on, because I've noticed it's like 50/50 some aspects of the animation, especially when there's some sort of CG thing like flying by action, action, super well animated.

850
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:44,519
Speaker 1: But when when a character is like turned into another character to talk, it's it's like they they're like it's almost like stop motion like it.

851
00:43:45,862 --> 00:43:50,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's strange, like for action scenes or fighting or casting magic spells or anything like that.

852
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,419
Speaker 0: The animation is super awesome.

853
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:54,300
Speaker 0: And it's like, whoa, this is really done in Flash.

854
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,579
Speaker 0: You shitting me, right?

855
00:43:55,981 --> 00:44:00,319
Speaker 0: You'd expect them to use, you know, whatever they use for like, you know, all the other digitally animated shows.

856
00:44:01,524 --> 00:44:03,560
Speaker 1: But Flash is surprisingly used more often than you think.

857
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, but when somebody is just sitting there talking like their head, it moves in weird sort of jerky ways.

858
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,599
Speaker 1: Well, it moves exactly the way you see characters move in JRPGs.

859
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,341
Speaker 0: Yeah.

860
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:23,460
Speaker 0: Or the way that like people move in like old crappy FMV's and old PlayStation video games or really old CG movies that were done really poorly before technology was good.

861
00:44:23,982 --> 00:44:27,660
Speaker 0: And, you know, but it's only the movement like the character still looks amazing.

862
00:44:28,243 --> 00:44:34,040
Speaker 0: It's just the movement of the character in the scenes where they're just talking is often kind of weird.

863
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,099
Speaker 0: It's almost like uncanny valley, but not I don't know.

864
00:44:37,664 --> 00:44:42,219
Speaker 1: So it follows the plot of a young boy named Hugo, who has the portal gun in his hands.

865
00:44:43,345 --> 00:44:43,466
Speaker 1: Yep.

866
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:45,360
Speaker 1: And is the descendant of dragons or something.

867
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,560
Speaker 1: We don't know what the deal is, but it opens.

868
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,099
Speaker 0: He's the magical mystery dude.

869
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:49,521
Speaker 1: There's.

870
00:44:49,541 --> 00:45:00,140
Speaker 1: there's definitely some homage because the whole show opens right with like a flash of magic in this village, this random village and this lone wolf and cub looking duo walks out of it.

871
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:00,540
Speaker 1: Yeah.

872
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:04,939
Speaker 1: Just guy who looks super dangerous pushing a carriage with a baby in it.

873
00:45:05,782 --> 00:45:10,380
Speaker 1: And something attacks him and he totally kicks its ass because he's lone wolf.

874
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,100
Speaker 1: I guess he's a dragon.

875
00:45:12,741 --> 00:45:15,740
Speaker 1: And the thing that attacks him is like, oh, he's so full of walk through.

876
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,514
Speaker 1: I want to eat it.

877
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,579
Speaker 0: You know, walk through is like the generic life energy that everyone, you know, the bad guys want to collect.

878
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:26,800
Speaker 0: And, you know, as an aside, this show and the bad guy is some sort of walk through powered robot who can travel.

879
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,699
Speaker 1: Definitely some sort of precursor technology situation going on in this world.

880
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,299
Speaker 1: I love shit like that.

881
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,642
Speaker 0: Yeah.

882
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:36,180
Speaker 1: But there's this maybe magic tech.

883
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:42,354
Speaker 1: They like the Prince of Nothing has a lot of proper nouns, made up gobbledygook, proper noun.

884
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,000
Speaker 1: that's just there.

885
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,458
Speaker 1: You know, that's high, don't you?

886
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:53,538
Speaker 0: And then, you know, the difference between the nursery and the in the in the Keonene Beach of a wookie chigra.

887
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:54,020
Speaker 0: Right.

888
00:45:54,601 --> 00:46:02,760
Speaker 1: But and I understand more French than I expected watching this because it's in French and French is something I studied in like high school.

889
00:46:02,882 --> 00:46:03,632
Speaker 1: And at RIT.

890
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:03,875
Speaker 1: Yeah.

891
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,300
Speaker 1: But I'm hampered by the fact that they use a lot of silly made up proper nouns.

892
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,780
Speaker 0: And, you know, I've noticed a lot of them are very Marduk and Gardakhan.

893
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,688
Speaker 0: Have you noticed that?

894
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:17,051
Speaker 1: Marduk.

895
00:46:17,313 --> 00:46:17,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are.

896
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:24,379
Speaker 0: That's hilarious for me because of because of that other the names to Princess Amalia Charan-Charmes.

897
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,478
Speaker 1: Sir Sedleygrove Persedal.

898
00:46:30,363 --> 00:46:31,219
Speaker 0: And Senor Gardakhan.

899
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:33,578
Speaker 0: Rubillax and Boba Fett.

900
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:38,977
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah, the thing is, you know, it's not it's.

901
00:46:39,017 --> 00:46:39,720
Speaker 0: you know, it's not bad.

902
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,057
Speaker 0: It's like, hey, it's it's a fantasy plot, right?

903
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:42,460
Speaker 0: It's fun.

904
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:42,802
Speaker 1: It's cute.

905
00:46:42,822 --> 00:46:45,179
Speaker 1: The main character totally just goes for it.

906
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:48,800
Speaker 0: But it's so generic in its fantasy plot.

907
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,322
Speaker 0: Is it like?

908
00:46:49,362 --> 00:46:55,340
Speaker 0: it doesn't have anything special that makes it stand out above all the other JRPG fantasy plots in the universe.

909
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,259
Speaker 1: Characters are all fun.

910
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,420
Speaker 1: Like I like the individual characters, but they're not great characters, at least not yet.

911
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,779
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of episodes, but it doesn't grab me as much as other things have grabbed me.

912
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:14,400
Speaker 0: It's like what makes this JRPG story better or different than a JRPG story from any Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, Valkyrie profile, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger story?

913
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,100
Speaker 1: Of course, it does get points for being very JRPG.

914
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,960
Speaker 1: Like early on when they're good, they go to the shop to try to buy a, quote, world map.

915
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:26,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, the map is pretty cool.

916
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,460
Speaker 1: And actually, I like that episode because one, the cat girl and her husband were pretty funny.

917
00:47:29,928 --> 00:47:30,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were right.

918
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,259
Speaker 1: And while the twist at the end was pretty obvious at the same time.

919
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:35,640
Speaker 0: It was Captain Obvious.

920
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,719
Speaker 1: It was also kind of funny.

921
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:37,693
Speaker 0: It was OK.

922
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,620
Speaker 1: Though the way it resolved at the end when he's like, how do you think I'm going to keep getting stuff for the shop?

923
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:44,056
Speaker 1: And she's like, darling.

924
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is, it's not, you know, it's like.

925
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:50,380
Speaker 0: it's not like ecstatically funny.

926
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,160
Speaker 0: It's just sort of like ha ha funny, you know, a little bit ha ha.

927
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:53,823
Speaker 0: It's not like.

928
00:47:54,346 --> 00:47:56,760
Speaker 0: it's not like, oh, my God, I need to watch more of this so bad.

929
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:57,120
Speaker 0: Right.

930
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:57,843
Speaker 0: That's how you know.

931
00:47:57,863 --> 00:48:02,220
Speaker 0: when something's good is when you absolutely cannot resist watching the next one.

932
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,948
Speaker 1: I know I often forget that, like because I watched.

933
00:48:04,988 --> 00:48:15,940
Speaker 1: there's this era from like 2003, 2004, when there was we were watching a lot of kind of generic anime because we almost felt obligated to, you know, anime club and everything like scryed and all that shit.

934
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:25,240
Speaker 1: And I just remember I'd be watching like a lot of anime and it'd be like, it's sure like, oh, no, I'll watch one more episode, then I'll go do something real and something actually fun.

935
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:30,199
Speaker 1: And then not that long ago, we were hanging out at someone's house a few years ago and maybe a year ago.

936
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:32,960
Speaker 1: And someone there hadn't seen Cowboy Bebop.

937
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,580
Speaker 1: So like, oh, just put on the first couple episodes.

938
00:48:36,642 --> 00:48:40,400
Speaker 1: And then I thought, oh, I'll half ignore it because I've seen Cowboy Bebop three times.

939
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,320
Speaker 1: I'll just play a board game.

940
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:47,300
Speaker 1: Now, I watched every second of Cowboy Bebop and desperately wanted to watch all of it immediately.

941
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:47,980
Speaker 0: Yeah.

942
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:56,780
Speaker 0: You know, Hajime no Ippo, I started, you know, I picked it up because it was in my queue and I burned through it like, you know, I don't know, phosphoric sulfuric acid.

943
00:48:57,061 --> 00:49:00,160
Speaker 1: My little pony, I watched as soon as I could.

944
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:00,941
Speaker 0: Yeah.

945
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:04,060
Speaker 0: As soon as the new pony episode came out, I was desperate to go and watch it.

946
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,320
Speaker 0: You know, Full Metal Alchemist, when it was coming out, we did that.

947
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:07,962
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

948
00:49:07,982 --> 00:49:12,080
Speaker 1: When Full Metal Alchemist was coming out, it was like the mad rush to see you could get it first.

949
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:12,701
Speaker 0: Yeah.

950
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:15,560
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, so that's how, you know, something's really good.

951
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,920
Speaker 0: Wakfu, I've watched a handful of episodes and really I would be just fine not watching any more ever.

952
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,418
Speaker 0: Like, if one was on, I would watch it.

953
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,802
Speaker 0: But it's not like.

954
00:49:23,842 --> 00:49:28,373
Speaker 0: I don't have this desperate need to see more, which puts it, you know, it's like, well, I'll just go to.

955
00:49:28,473 --> 00:49:31,300
Speaker 0: I'll definitely go to something else before I go to Wakfu.

956
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,061
Speaker 0: Right.

957
00:49:32,443 --> 00:49:34,315
Speaker 0: Not that it's not bad, but it's just not.

958
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:35,120
Speaker 0: it's not great.

959
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:35,464
Speaker 0: I don't know.

960
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:36,499
Speaker 0: It doesn't stand out.

961
00:49:36,621 --> 00:49:37,313
Speaker 0: It's not amazing.

962
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:37,760
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

963
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,560
Speaker 0: It's just another JRPG plot.

964
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,682
Speaker 1: You probably won't be happy.

965
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:48,179
Speaker 1: It gives me the same level of enjoyment as an individual episode of, say, Fist of the North Star.

966
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:51,580
Speaker 1: Individual episode for individual episode.

967
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,540
Speaker 1: Now, the overall enjoyment of Fist of the North Star is higher because there's this compounding as you watch more episodes.

968
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,261
Speaker 0: That is the thing.

969
00:49:59,301 --> 00:50:07,180
Speaker 0: I think what Wakfu could have done to make me more interested, right, was to actually bring more heat on that initial plot.

970
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:07,680
Speaker 0: Right.

971
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:16,440
Speaker 0: Because it's that typical JRPG stuff where, you know, there's a hidden great power and we give you a hint of it at the beginning and then it's hidden away.

972
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:20,300
Speaker 0: And as the episodes go on, it won't be revealed until the very end.

973
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,285
Speaker 0: And then it will come back.

974
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:23,719
Speaker 0: You know, every JRPG does that.

975
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,687
Speaker 0: And it always bothers me.

976
00:50:25,747 --> 00:50:27,500
Speaker 0: The worst one of those is Luffy.

977
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,260
Speaker 0: You ever play Luffy?

978
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:30,380
Speaker 1: I tried to play Luffy.

979
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:33,816
Speaker 0: At the very beginning of Luffy, you are right.

980
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,740
Speaker 0: The great, heroic, epic party of legend in your super high level.

981
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:43,200
Speaker 0: And you go and you play out basically the legend.

982
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:50,320
Speaker 0: It would be like if there was a pony RPG and level one was like, you are Celestia, use the elements of harmony to stop Nightmare Moon.

983
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:58,360
Speaker 0: And then as soon as you beat that first level, you're like the great, you know, descendant of that party's leader.

984
00:50:59,163 --> 00:51:00,680
Speaker 0: And you're just some punk kid with nothing.

985
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:02,337
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, what the fuck?

986
00:51:02,418 --> 00:51:02,620
Speaker 0: Right.

987
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,680
Speaker 0: And it takes until the end of the game to get back to the epic shit.

988
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,760
Speaker 0: It's like, give me something that's epic the whole goddamn time, asshole.

989
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,580
Speaker 0: See, look at Fist of the North Star.

990
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,500
Speaker 0: It's epic the whole time.

991
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:19,020
Speaker 0: You don't get to start, you don't see the nuclear war that much, but you see it's always Kenshiro and Kenshiro is the guy.

992
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:19,800
Speaker 0: Right.

993
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:23,759
Speaker 0: It's not like the real guy was Kenshiro's ancestor and Kenshiro is just sort of...

994
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,340
Speaker 1: See, you don't always need epic.

995
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,288
Speaker 1: Look at Cowboy Bebop.

996
00:51:26,308 --> 00:51:27,540
Speaker 1: There's no epic plot.

997
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,520
Speaker 0: Look, I'm on heroin here.

998
00:51:29,702 --> 00:51:29,904
Speaker 0: Right.

999
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,199
Speaker 0: Your methadone ain't going to work.

1000
00:51:32,944 --> 00:51:34,439
Speaker 0: I need that big shit all the time.

1001
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:35,681
Speaker 0: Right.

1002
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:39,580
Speaker 0: Don't give me the dragon in the first episode and then not give me the dragon in the fourth episode.

1003
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,140
Speaker 1: I want more dragon stuff.

1004
00:51:41,521 --> 00:51:41,762
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1005
00:51:41,802 --> 00:51:48,580
Speaker 0: You know, don't bring out the time shifting bad guy in episode one and two and then hide him away until later.

1006
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:48,881
Speaker 0: Right.

1007
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:49,465
Speaker 0: Bring him out.

1008
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:51,479
Speaker 0: I want to, you know, let's see what he's up to.

1009
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:58,280
Speaker 1: But seriously, like if you enjoy shows like Slayers or Goku-Do, you know, any of those...

1010
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,854
Speaker 0: I think it's exactly equal to Goku-Do, I think.

1011
00:52:00,955 --> 00:52:01,800
Speaker 0: That's exactly right.

1012
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,480
Speaker 1: Because Goku-Do was a little like it had his great moments, but overall it started to peter out.

1013
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,771
Speaker 1: It wasn't quite as good as Slayers.

1014
00:52:07,093 --> 00:52:07,860
Speaker 1: And also, I got to qualify.

1015
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:08,984
Speaker 1: I really like Slayers.

1016
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:13,100
Speaker 1: It is a great show, but simultaneously has its problems.

1017
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,780
Speaker 0: Slayers is not perfect.

1018
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:24,210
Speaker 1: Slayers actually has a surprising amount of shounen style fighting Dragon Ball Z where people stand there going, "Oh, is he going to use this power?

1019
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,138
Speaker 1: Is he going to use that

1020
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:25,319
Speaker 1: power?".

1021
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,731
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it doesn't last more than an episode.

1022
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:27,740
Speaker 0: It's within the episode.

1023
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,720
Speaker 1: And it always cuts to, you know, someone praying to Zormo Gooster.

1024
00:52:31,383 --> 00:52:32,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, Zormo Gooster.

1025
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,240
Speaker 1: I love Zormo Gooster.

1026
00:52:33,863 --> 00:52:34,296
Speaker 1: The best guy.

1027
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,920
Speaker 0: Zormo Gooster is better than all of Wakfu added together.

1028
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:41,439
Speaker 1: Zormo Gooster is pretty much the god of the gods.

1029
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,059
Speaker 0: Zormo Gooster could beat Kenshiro.

1030
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,847
Speaker 1: Oh, easily.

1031
00:52:44,234 --> 00:52:44,559
Speaker 1: Easily.

1032
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,940
Speaker 1: But Kenshiro could definitely beat Gov, the Demon Dragon King.

1033
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,700
Speaker 0: Well, that's not even a contest.

1034
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,360
Speaker 1: In fact, the Demon Dragon King, Gov, is already dead.

1035
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:54,858
Speaker 1: Yep.

1036
00:52:56,241 --> 00:53:01,800
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah, if you're the kind of person, you know, because I know those people exist, where it's like you can't get enough of JRPGs.

1037
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:09,180
Speaker 0: Like, a JRPG comes out and you just play it like crazy, you know, and you just get hooked into every old JRPG on the planet or anything with that kind of story.

1038
00:53:09,943 --> 00:53:10,318
Speaker 0: Or, you know.

1039
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,720
Speaker 1: Or if you like procedural adventurer drama.

1040
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if adventurers are going on a fantasy quest, you just really can't get enough of that.

1041
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,479
Speaker 0: Then you can't get, then Wakfu is another one of those for you.

1042
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:24,860
Speaker 0: And the best part is you don't have to press A to, you know, to fight random encounters.

1043
00:53:24,941 --> 00:53:25,960
Speaker 0: You just get the story part.

1044
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:35,860
Speaker 0: The only, I think the real weakness of Wakfu is that the characters, they're okay, but they're not like, they're not really strong, you know?

1045
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,960
Speaker 0: It's like, they have their personalities, right?

1046
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,220
Speaker 0: But they're not strong personalities in one direction or another, right?

1047
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,200
Speaker 0: It's like, this money guy, the main character is really, like, has no personality whatsoever.

1048
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,400
Speaker 0: He's so nothing.

1049
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:55,240
Speaker 0: You know, there's the, actually the best of the whole main characters is the little sword that the knight has to fight with.

1050
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,080
Speaker 0: Oh, the shabu, I forget what the demons are called.

1051
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,620
Speaker 0: The knight is pretty boring, but his sword is actually pretty cool.

1052
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,740
Speaker 1: George just wants to fuck shit up, that's all he cares about.

1053
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,140
Speaker 1: He's like, come on, come on, let me take over, it'll be fine.

1054
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,000
Speaker 0: And the two princesses, you know, the princess and her assistant, it's like, they're all right.

1055
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,840
Speaker 0: And they have, you know, they're, you know, whatever.

1056
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,440
Speaker 0: But they're not, like, strong.

1057
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,140
Speaker 0: Look at the ponies, the ponies are strong characters, right?

1058
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,620
Speaker 0: It's like Twilight Sparkle, the nerd, right?

1059
00:54:18,081 --> 00:54:20,000
Speaker 1: Also the Jean Grey, but we'll talk about that later.

1060
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:26,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that's why people always compare it to, like, Team Fortress 2, which also has the strong personalities in the characters, you know?

1061
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:30,840
Speaker 0: And that's, you know, I guess that just works for me, when the characters are like that.

1062
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,240
Speaker 0: How'd you mean if it was the same thing, right?

1063
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:33,479
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I was looking for it.

1064
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:38,998
Speaker 1: The best Gardakhan name in Wakafu is Grogologran.

1065
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:40,312
Speaker 0: Wow.

1066
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,647
Speaker 1: G-R-O-U-G-A-L-O-R-A-G-R-A-N.

1067
00:54:47,304 --> 00:54:48,119
Speaker 1: That's pretty great.

1068
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,879
Speaker 0: It's Grogologran.

1069
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,330
Speaker 1: Grogologran.

1070
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:57,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's even better than Gardakhan, or Marduk.

1071
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,239
Speaker 1: Noximilian is pretty good, too.

1072
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,779
Speaker 0: There's also, right underneath that, is Cabrock.

1073
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:04,200
Speaker 0: Cabrock is very Marduk.

1074
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,160
Speaker 1: You're looking at the Wikipedia.

1075
00:55:05,741 --> 00:55:06,245
Speaker 0: So are you.

1076
00:55:06,266 --> 00:55:08,000
Speaker 0: Master Goldtard, yeah.

1077
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,679
Speaker 1: Breadnaught.

1078
00:55:08,961 --> 00:55:09,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're done with this.

1079
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're done with that.

1080
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,908
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's a fine show.

1081
00:55:11,928 --> 00:55:19,197
Speaker 1: It's like a solid B. I'd say B- because I consider Scrap Princess to be a solid B. I have a pretty nice scale.

1082
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:19,523
Speaker 0: Really?

1083
00:55:19,544 --> 00:55:20,660
Speaker 0: I think it's equal to Scrap Princess.

1084
00:55:21,081 --> 00:55:22,240
Speaker 1: No, Scrap Princess is better.

1085
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:22,840
Speaker 1: Anyway.

1086
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,460
Speaker 1: Because Scrap Princess is a better animation.

1087
00:55:25,624 --> 00:55:27,100
Speaker 1: And I think better characters.

1088
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,020
Speaker 1: And actually was a pretty great show.

1089
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:35,620
Speaker 1: Except for the fact that Scrap Princess pulled the biggest "Let's figure it all out" at the end I've ever seen.

1090
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,840
Speaker 1: Even worse than Paranoid Agent, which is a great show.

1091
00:55:38,303 --> 00:55:39,560
Speaker 0: I'll agree with your B- rating.

1092
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:47,480
Speaker 1: Because Scrap Princess, the entire plot is revealed after the eye catch in the last episode.

1093
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,022
Speaker 0: Not as bad as Alien 9.

1094
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:50,848
Speaker 1: Where the big-?

1095
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:53,330
Speaker 1: well, because Alien 9 was kind of like in media res.

1096
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:54,199
Speaker 1: You gotta give it that.

1097
00:55:56,287 --> 00:55:56,598
Speaker 0: Uhhh... no.

1098
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,029
Speaker 1: Plus, that wasn't even a plot.

1099
00:55:58,089 --> 00:56:01,053
Speaker 1: It was just, "Oh, if you happened to watch the credits, that poor girl

1100
00:56:01,093 --> 00:56:01,455
Speaker 1: died.".

1101
00:56:02,181 --> 00:56:02,224
Speaker 0: Oh.

1102
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,360
Speaker 0: By getting squished in a very Wicked City kind of way.

1103
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,840
Speaker 1: Alien 9 is pretty awesome.

1104
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,837
Speaker 1: I feel like we should watch it and review it.

1105
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,680
Speaker 1: Because I haven't seen it since we used to hang out with Luke.

1106
00:56:16,821 --> 00:56:19,500
Speaker 0: I only saw it because I was in a room when someone else was watching it.

1107
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,420
Speaker 1: Gaby was watching it and then we went to play board games.

1108
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:22,689
Speaker 0: I didn't actually watch it.

1109
00:56:22,729 --> 00:56:24,120
Speaker 0: I was just in a room when it was being watched.

1110
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,336
Speaker 1: I have a manga from it, too, laying around.

1111
00:56:26,376 --> 00:56:26,880
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

1112
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:27,859
Speaker 1: I don't know where I got it.

1113
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:30,000
Speaker 0: I can't even remember this shit.

1114
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:39,950
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1115
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:45,090
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
