1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,205
Speaker 1: Bunnies and flying.

2
00:00:09,628 --> 00:00:11,700
Speaker 1: Bunnies like flying less than they like most things.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,840
Speaker 0: Lucky rabbit's foot in Vegas.

4
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:16,999
Speaker 1: You know, the lucky rabbit's foots are really unlucky for the rabbits they get them from.

5
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:21,199
Speaker 0: Rabbit doesn't need money.

6
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:24,540
Speaker 1: How's a rabbit gonna get all that swag of hay?

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,817
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,780
Speaker 0: It just grows out of the fucking ground.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, where are they gonna get it?

10
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:32,060
Speaker 1: Rabbit in the city, not a lot of good grass.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,100
Speaker 1: You need money.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,805
Speaker 0: You gotta move.

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,594
Speaker 0: You're a rabbit, you're quick.

14
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:35,160
Speaker 0: You can get there.

15
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:36,860
Speaker 1: But you wanna leave New York?

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,008
Speaker 1: You wanna leave New York?

17
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,179
Speaker 1: That's where all the jobs are.

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:39,824
Speaker 0: You're a rabbit?

19
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:41,079
Speaker 0: There's no rabbit jobs in New York.

20
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,600
Speaker 1: I think there are plenty of rabbit jobs in New York.

21
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:43,943
Speaker 1: Really?

22
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:45,460
Speaker 0: What's a rabbit job gonna get for a job?

23
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,759
Speaker 1: Eat all the dandelions.

24
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:47,526
Speaker 1: Where?

25
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:48,459
Speaker 1: Get 'em out of the park.

26
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,170
Speaker 1: No more dandelions.

27
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,059
Speaker 0: Rabbit live in the park?

28
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:52,268
Speaker 1: Uh, be cute.

29
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:52,854
Speaker 1: Photo ops.

30
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:53,400
Speaker 1: Rabbit model.

31
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:58,860
Speaker 1: If the internet has taught me anything, being cute is a business model.

32
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,179
Speaker 0: Alright, well, how come you're not taking advantage of that?

33
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:07,600
Speaker 1: Uh, there is no way to read that but you having just said that I'm cute.

34
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:09,620
Speaker 0: Oh, 'cause you own rabbits.

35
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:13,820
Speaker 0: You're not selling your rabbits for cute photo ops.

36
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,220
Speaker 1: So, uh, the other day, I was biking home from work.

37
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,158
Speaker 0: We did an intro to this show.

38
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:19,666
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I guess we didn't.

39
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:21,800
Speaker 1: It's mechanical for Liebowitz.

40
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:24,539
Speaker 1: We recorded this way later than normal.

41
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:27,120
Speaker 1: It's October 2nd, Geek Nights.

42
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:28,358
Speaker 1: Great.

43
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,699
Speaker 1: Yeah.

44
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:34,659
Speaker 1: So, uh, anyway, so I'm biking home from work.

45
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:39,339
Speaker 1: And because they've added, like, three stop signs and a new light to my old way home.

46
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:39,851
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

47
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,279
Speaker 1: So now, I actually go out of my way to take the bike path along the East River, like, all the way home.

48
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:48,340
Speaker 1: 'Cause that's just way... It's actually faster now most of the time.

49
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:51,080
Speaker 1: Unless I run every stoplight.

50
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:52,488
Speaker 1: But, which is fine.

51
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,100
Speaker 1: Like, I'll do the Idaho whatever protocol.

52
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,340
Speaker 1: But lately, there's been cops there, like, hanging out at the intersections.

53
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,020
Speaker 1: And I saw a biker getting a ticket.

54
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,740
Speaker 1: So, gonna just let that hang out for a while.

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,337
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,586
Speaker 1: So, I'm biking on the bike path.

57
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:08,360
Speaker 1: It's a separated, two-lane bike path.

58
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:08,713
Speaker 0: Yep.

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,779
Speaker 0: A green painted one.

60
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,919
Speaker 0: It has some shitty areas, though, but most of it's okay.

61
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,733
Speaker 1: And they've actually, they've fixed it bit by bit.

62
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:14,560
Speaker 1: Like, it's getting better and better.

63
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,880
Speaker 0: Some of the good parts are even better than they used to be, but the shitty parts are still shitty.

64
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,380
Speaker 0: Like, the part by the power plant where it's really narrow.

65
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:20,648
Speaker 1: Yep.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Speaker 0: And the part by the little warehouses where the street is, you're basically just going on this beat-up old sidewalk.

67
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,579
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the worst.

68
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,096
Speaker 0: And the part where you have to go onto First Avenue because it ends and the

69
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:30,237
Speaker 0: U.N.'

70
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:30,720
Speaker 0: 's on the way.

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,075
Speaker 1: Yep.

72
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,149
Speaker 0: I don't know, I just don't go around the U.N So, I'm biking and there's a thing.

73
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,480
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, you're thinking of the East River Bikeway.

74
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:38,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

75
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,919
Speaker 1: I'm on the opposite side of the river.

76
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:40,265
Speaker 1: Oh.

77
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:42,599
Speaker 1: There's another, there's a bikeway right there, too.

78
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,240
Speaker 0: And it has the same properties as the one on the other side of the East River?

79
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,480
Speaker 1: Yes, it took three properties.

80
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:50,898
Speaker 0: It has a power plant that doesn't exist with a narrow bridge.

81
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:55,880
Speaker 1: So, it has a bunch of old warehouses and, like, generating stations that are being torn down.

82
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, by the sugar factory.

83
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,313
Speaker 1: Yeah.

84
00:02:57,622 --> 00:02:57,800
Speaker 1: Yeah.

85
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,920
Speaker 1: So, anyway, so it took a couple of aspects.

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,520
Speaker 1: I was like, I think he's talking about the wrong, anyway.

87
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,639
Speaker 1: So, I'm biking there.

88
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,260
Speaker 1: I'm going, like, 24-ish miles an hour.

89
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,080
Speaker 1: I'm going pretty fast because it's, like, downhill.

90
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,759
Speaker 1: And this woman just literally steps out between two cars jaywalking right in front of me.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,169
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

92
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:17,580
Speaker 1: So, I swerve to the right because she doesn't even notice me and she keeps walking.

93
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,200
Speaker 1: And then her hand is back and she pulls into my path her young daughter.

94
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,010
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

95
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,020
Speaker 1: So, now I literally almost flipped over my handlebars trying to not hit her daughter and probably severely injure her.

96
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,620
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

97
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:35,079
Speaker 1: I considered just slamming into the woman because I figured she could take it.

98
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:37,059
Speaker 1: There's no way to avoid them both.

99
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:39,280
Speaker 1: I almost flipped over my handlebars.

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,860
Speaker 1: I stopped.

101
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,958
Speaker 1: I barely avoid them.

102
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:44,359
Speaker 1: She screams and starts yelling at me.

103
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:44,832
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

104
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,220
Speaker 1: And for once, like, usually I just ignore people when that happens.

105
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,160
Speaker 1: I just, like, keep biking.

106
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,593
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

107
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,440
Speaker 1: But I was like, "Listen, lady, you almost got your daughter killed.

108
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:53,780
Speaker 1: You're a terrible mother.

109
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:54,464
Speaker 1: Don't

110
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,013
Speaker 1: jaywalk.".

111
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:55,755
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

112
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:59,080
Speaker 1: And she was stunned into indignant silence.

113
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:02,697
Speaker 1: And then her daughter was like, "Mommy, you should really listen to the

114
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:03,119
Speaker 1: man.".

115
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:03,817
Speaker 1: Yeah.

116
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:07,240
Speaker 1: And then I started laughing so hard that I almost cried.

117
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,100
Speaker 1: And I biked away because she was so curious.

118
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,820
Speaker 0: You should have high-fived the little daughter and then biked away.

119
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:17,100
Speaker 1: But it was, like, it was the kind of thing that normally only happens in movies.

120
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,298
Speaker 1: Like, it was too perfect.

121
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:18,933
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,877
Speaker 0: Go, little daughter, go.

123
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,326
Speaker 0: Yup.

124
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,380
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get killed once you cross the street on your own.

125
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:26,193
Speaker 1: Yup.

126
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,200
Speaker 1: Though, funnily enough, I saw a video this morning.

127
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,676
Speaker 1: The Gothamist was like, "This is what it looks like when a pedestrian

128
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:32,219
Speaker 1: jaywalks.".

129
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,539
Speaker 0: Well, that guy, did you read that?

130
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:34,059
Speaker 0: Yeah.

131
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,579
Speaker 1: That guy had a car horn.

132
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,136
Speaker 0: Well, no.

133
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,980
Speaker 0: He saw this dude coming because he had a light on his bike like he's supposed to.

134
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,277
Speaker 0: Yup.

135
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:43,059
Speaker 0: And he knew the guy wasn't looking, and he knew he wouldn't hit him.

136
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,120
Speaker 0: So he intentionally made it a close call to teach the guy a lesson.

137
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,618
Speaker 1: You know what?

138
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:47,660
Speaker 1: I approve.

139
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,543
Speaker 0: Eh.

140
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:49,899
Speaker 1: You know what it's like?

141
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:53,100
Speaker 0: It's like- I think that was just an old guy who's not, can't learn a lesson.

142
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:53,778
Speaker 0: He's too old.

143
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:54,228
Speaker 1: Yeah.

144
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,220
Speaker 1: The look of terror on his face, though, was kind of beautiful.

145
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:58,892
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

146
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,875
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

147
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,580
Speaker 1: It's Thursday.

148
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,539
Speaker 1: It's the lounge.

149
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:02,600
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

150
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,300
Speaker 0: Talk about anything.

151
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,779
Speaker 0: You don't have book clubs in a lounge.

152
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,229
Speaker 0: Yeah?

153
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,040
Speaker 0: Imagine a lounge with a book club in it.

154
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,198
Speaker 0: Not getting out of a good mix.

155
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,880
Speaker 0: Your book club belongs in the library or the Barnes and Noble.

156
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,300
Speaker 1: There actually is a writer's lounge near our building.

157
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's not a lounge like the kind of lounge that- That's the kind of lounge I'm thinking about.

158
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,260
Speaker 0: A lounge is the place where you have a lounge singer.

159
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,140
Speaker 1: I was thinking about the book lounge.

160
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,218
Speaker 0: That's not a lounge.

161
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,959
Speaker 1: I guess in the Midwest, you could have the lounge as a room separate from the family room.

162
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,955
Speaker 0: A lounge is a place with leopard print couches and alcohol and a small tiny stage with a shitty keyboard on it.

163
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:41,680
Speaker 0: Possibly an organ with one of those circle curtains that goes around it.

164
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,880
Speaker 1: Now, if it's fancy, it'll be a real piano and there'll be a lady singing.

165
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,359
Speaker 0: That might be more of a club.

166
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,020
Speaker 0: If it gets too good, it's no longer a lounge.

167
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,719
Speaker 0: It becomes a club.

168
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,880
Speaker 1: Thing is, nowadays, club means bad music, playing so loud you can't talk to anyone.

169
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,139
Speaker 0: Well, there are many kinds of clubs.

170
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,420
Speaker 0: There's an anime club too, right?

171
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,780
Speaker 0: A lounge is much more specific.

172
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,438
Speaker 1: So, if you hit someone with a club- That's right.

173
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:04,539
Speaker 1: All right.

174
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,015
Speaker 1: All right.

175
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:08,019
Speaker 1: So, anyway, it's the lounge.

176
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,740
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

177
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,700
Speaker 1: And recently, a time capsule was unearthed in New York.

178
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,173
Speaker 1: This is a time capsule from 1950, buried in Brooklyn.

179
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,177
Speaker 1: I think it was buried by the MTA or by the organization that became it.

180
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:25,580
Speaker 1: Time capsule buried beneath old Metropolitan Transportation Authority headquarters in downtown Brooklyn.

181
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:28,200
Speaker 1: They cracked it open yesterday.

182
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:37,779
Speaker 1: And what they found inside was basically a note to the past saying, "Time capsules need to be waterproof,

183
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,220
Speaker 1: motherfuckers.".

184
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,640
Speaker 1: It was just a rotten mess of garbage.

185
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,040
Speaker 0: You got to make a high-quality time capsule.

186
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,180
Speaker 0: That's what makes it a capsule.

187
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,740
Speaker 1: So, the funniest thing, everything was ruined.

188
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,860
Speaker 1: The microfiche, the document, it was all just this tomato soup-looking rust sludge.

189
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:55,900
Speaker 1: The line at the bottom of this article is beautiful.

190
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,939
Speaker 1: The line at the bottom of this article is why I made this my news.

191
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:08,498
Speaker 1: Quote, "The capsule itself might, however, be salvageable and will be put on display at the New York Transit

192
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:08,899
Speaker 1: Museum.".

193
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:10,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what?

194
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,760
Speaker 1: Unless the caption is just the word "fail" in impact fonts.

195
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:20,520
Speaker 0: Out and flushing at the World's Fairgrounds in the park, there's a real time capsule that is definitely still in one piece.

196
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:21,440
Speaker 1: I know about that time capsule.

197
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,980
Speaker 0: It's not supposed to be open until well after we're dead.

198
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:27,397
Speaker 0: We should sneak there at night with jackhammers and get it.

199
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:29,147
Speaker 1: Hold it hostage?

200
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,760
Speaker 1: Scott, that's some Lupin shit.

201
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,780
Speaker 0: That's what I'm talking about.

202
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,239
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I could pull that off.

203
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:35,560
Speaker 0: Do you know how to use a jackhammer?

204
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,659
Speaker 0: Do you know how to make it so no one will hear it?

205
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,599
Speaker 1: I know how to use a jackhammer.

206
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:44,060
Speaker 1: Maybe put a silencer on it.

207
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,860
Speaker 0: There's a concrete sidewalk with a metal plaque thingy, and then underneath that is a bunch of dirt.

208
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,000
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's directly underneath that or not.

209
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,367
Speaker 0: It might be offset slightly.

210
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:55,539
Speaker 0: If we dig straight down, we might not find it.

211
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:59,060
Speaker 1: There is a better time capsule that we could steal.

212
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,514
Speaker 1: Where?

213
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:02,720
Speaker 1: Oh no, it's the same one.

214
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:11,880
Speaker 1: The people who made the Westinghouse time capsule, the one in the Corona Meadows Park, they used that design to make a couple other ones as well.

215
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,834
Speaker 0: The quality ones.

216
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,938
Speaker 1: You know how these things work?

217
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:21,200
Speaker 1: They're suspended by a string, like a big metal cable, so they're just floating down in a deep pit.

218
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:28,980
Speaker 1: They're covered in this alloy that's designed to last 5,000 years without any sort of measurable corrosion.

219
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,584
Speaker 1: They're shaped like a missile.

220
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:34,480
Speaker 1: They have glass, wool, nose cushions, and all these things in case they break.

221
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,240
Speaker 1: The inside is actually Pyrex glass, and then inside of that is a ridiculous amount of shit.

222
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,504
Speaker 0: Actually, we don't have to dig.

223
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:46,740
Speaker 0: We just have to basically flip the lid open, grab the hook that it's hanging on, and lift it up.

224
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:48,768
Speaker 1: I think the lid is sealed.

225
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:49,912
Speaker 1: Look, here's what it looks like.

226
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:50,655
Speaker 1: The lid is sealed.

227
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:51,780
Speaker 1: You have to jackhammer this thing off.

228
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,430
Speaker 0: That is not sticking out of the ground anymore.

229
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,100
Speaker 0: You can't see that part there now.

230
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,467
Speaker 1: No, this is the exhibit.

231
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:57,879
Speaker 1: This just shows you what they look like.

232
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,340
Speaker 0: If you go there now, it's a piece of metal on the ground.

233
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:01,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, there it is.

234
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:06,180
Speaker 1: You have to bust the concrete up, and then winch it out of the ground.

235
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,820
Speaker 0: Why don't we just get a crane?

236
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:10,868
Speaker 1: No one will notice that.

237
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,740
Speaker 1: There's the problem with this time capsule.

238
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:15,659
Speaker 1: Here's a picture of what's in it from when they buried it.

239
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:16,284
Speaker 0: Yeah.

240
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:18,200
Speaker 0: Sure.

241
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,260
Speaker 1: It's got to last a thousand years, and no one's going to care, because here's the picture.

242
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:22,978
Speaker 0: But we could have that stuff.

243
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,462
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

244
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:24,904
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

245
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:29,420
Speaker 1: I saw this exact camera for sale at a lomography shop in Brooklyn.

246
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that camera has film in it.

247
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,744
Speaker 1: That is true.

248
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,400
Speaker 1: These three things are reels of film.

249
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,139
Speaker 0: Yes, we could watch those films.

250
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,000
Speaker 1: That looks like a computer mouse, but obviously it's not.

251
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,020
Speaker 0: There's good stuff in there.

252
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,578
Speaker 1: So, anyway, got any news?

253
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,780
Speaker 0: I mean, well, I guess it's not really much news, but Windows 10, Windows 9 got skipped.

254
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,006
Speaker 0: I don't know.

255
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:53,060
Speaker 0: There's nothing really to say about it.

256
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,361
Speaker 1: Did you see?

257
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:57,780
Speaker 1: I saw an article where someone posited why Windows 9 was skipped.

258
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:58,659
Speaker 0: It's a bad number.

259
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:00,019
Speaker 1: No, here's the deal.

260
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:03,020
Speaker 1: And they showed some code examples, so there's some plausibility to this.

261
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,317
Speaker 0: The catch up to Apple, which is OS X.

262
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:09,630
Speaker 1: A lot of Windows version detection functions.

263
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:14,780
Speaker 1: look for Windows space nine dot star.

264
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:15,457
Speaker 0: Why?

265
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,700
Speaker 1: Because they're trying to detect Windows 95 or 98.

266
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:19,743
Speaker 0: Oh.

267
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:22,680
Speaker 1: That might be the only reason.

268
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:23,820
Speaker 0: That's a good reason, though.

269
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:24,639
Speaker 1: It is actually a good reason.

270
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,553
Speaker 0: Also, you know, 10's a much better number.

271
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:27,540
Speaker 0: It catches up to Apple.

272
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,440
Speaker 0: Apple has been on OS X for a thousand years.

273
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,560
Speaker 1: Remember when Winamp went one, two, three, five?

274
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:37,262
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know, the thing about it is I'm still using Windows 7.

275
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:37,878
Speaker 1: As am I.

276
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,980
Speaker 0: And it still feels perfectly new.

277
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
Speaker 0: It doesn't feel like there is a newer Windows.

278
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:45,000
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, yeah, Windows 8 is a thing that exists.

279
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:45,540
Speaker 1: Right.

280
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:49,260
Speaker 1: Well, I would have gotten Windows 8 if I built a new computer.

281
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:50,900
Speaker 0: Maybe, I guess.

282
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,840
Speaker 1: Since Windows 7 came out.

283
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,602
Speaker 0: But it's like, until there's a reason to get a new computer, it's like there's no reason for me to spend money on Windows 10.

284
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,599
Speaker 0: And I'm definitely not going to get a shady pirated one.

285
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:02,156
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, that's the thing is with Windows.

286
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:02,820
Speaker 1: now is that desktop.

287
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,260
Speaker 0: And everything that you still use your computer for, Windows 7 is totally fully supported.

288
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:08,860
Speaker 0: It supports everything.

289
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,980
Speaker 0: Every hardware is supported.

290
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,099
Speaker 1: On a desktop computer.

291
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,400
Speaker 0: All new software supports Windows 7 and all the hardware I already have is supported by Windows 7.

292
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,461
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, here are the reasons to buy Windows 10.

293
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,000
Speaker 1: One, you build a new computer.

294
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,880
Speaker 0: And you can't get a copy of Windows 7.

295
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,840
Speaker 1: And you can't transfer your license that you already paid for because you bought the OEM license or whatever.

296
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:28,338
Speaker 0: Maybe.

297
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:32,960
Speaker 1: Two, your current version of Windows is actually out of support.

298
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:33,568
Speaker 0: Maybe.

299
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:36,219
Speaker 1: Those are all the reasons.

300
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:40,140
Speaker 0: So, I don't, you know.

301
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,080
Speaker 1: The thing is I feel like Windows 8 was the, it's not ME.

302
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,340
Speaker 1: Like people always talk, like I saw all these charts.

303
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,900
Speaker 1: It's like everyone's so young.

304
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:49,380
Speaker 1: They don't understand or remember Windows.

305
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,640
Speaker 1: They're like, man, every other version of Windows sucks.

306
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,160
Speaker 1: Like the TikTok with the Apple phones.

307
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,480
Speaker 1: They're like, Windows 95 sucked and 98 was awesome.

308
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,180
Speaker 1: I was like, alright kid, already you're stupid.

309
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,380
Speaker 1: Windows 95 was possibly one of the most revolutionary operating systems in modern history.

310
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,460
Speaker 0: If I was Microsoft, what I would do is I would just be like, alright, you know what the fuck?

311
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,280
Speaker 0: It's called Windows.

312
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:09,560
Speaker 0: It's free for everyone except businesses.

313
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,379
Speaker 0: Businesses have to pay a fucking fortune.

314
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:12,336
Speaker 0: The end.

315
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:19,399
Speaker 0: And then the business windows, the only differences would be things that businesses absolutely need that no human being.

316
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,059
Speaker 1: Well, you know what I'd sell?

317
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,920
Speaker 1: I'd sell things like holding, staging, and pushing patches.

318
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:25,859
Speaker 1: Security restrictions.

319
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:40,080
Speaker 0: No, I would just be like, yeah, uh, what's, what makes windows 10 like business-y, not windows 10, but like the business version, the business version, these applications that we also make that you absolutely need will refuse to run on the regular one.

320
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,516
Speaker 0: So it's like, oh, you need SharePoint that absolutely will just refuse to run on the free one.

321
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:50,460
Speaker 1: It's just really a shame that, I mean, there's Apple, which is always on hardware.

322
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,939
Speaker 1: There's windows and that's it.

323
00:12:55,722 --> 00:13:00,240
Speaker 1: That in all this time there is still no BOS, Linux.

324
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,778
Speaker 1: So at my company, we were talking about, you know, like charting frameworks and whatever and all this stuff.

325
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:12,899
Speaker 1: And we were looking at compatibility and at one point we're like, wow, that framework is great, but it only works on windows.

326
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:17,500
Speaker 1: And then we were all quiet for like several seconds.

327
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:22,420
Speaker 1: And then our new developer heard is like, do we support the client on Linux?

328
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,900
Speaker 1: And I was like, well, yeah, it's Java, so it runs.

329
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Speaker 1: And he was like, does any, has anyone ever used it on Linux?

330
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:36,140
Speaker 1: And I was like, my QA team, Linux desktop is a joke.

331
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:36,835
Speaker 0: Yes.

332
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:38,499
Speaker 1: But it's not Monday.

333
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,718
Speaker 1: It's Thursday.

334
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:41,916
Speaker 0: This shows you how little news there is.

335
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:43,880
Speaker 1: Well, there's plenty of news.

336
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:44,520
Speaker 1: It's just not news.

337
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:46,059
Speaker 1: We like, what am I going to say about Ebola?

338
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:47,035
Speaker 0: Don't get it.

339
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,579
Speaker 1: You know what you can learn about Ebola?

340
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,416
Speaker 1: Go to CNN.

341
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:52,540
Speaker 1: My opinion, don't touch people who look like they have Ebola.

342
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,200
Speaker 0: Don't go anywhere that you've heard about Ebola being.

343
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,740
Speaker 1: Unless you are an altruist who really wants to go help and make a difference.

344
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,480
Speaker 0: If you are a doctor, not just a dumb altruist who's not a doctor.

345
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,759
Speaker 1: I don't want, I don't want some like lame-o.

346
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,059
Speaker 0: And also a real doctor, not a made up doctor.

347
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,440
Speaker 1: Hi everybody.

348
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,135
Speaker 0: Yes.

349
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:13,480
Speaker 0: And like you actually know something about viruses too.

350
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,180
Speaker 0: If you're some other like an orthopedist, you're not going to be able to help.

351
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:23,379
Speaker 1: I'd happily talk about the fact that Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un, might have broken his ankles because he's fat.

352
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,500
Speaker 0: He's just walking around?

353
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, like he might have fractured his ankles.

354
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,580
Speaker 0: He must have been doing something.

355
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,420
Speaker 0: Isn't he always riding horses and shit?

356
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,259
Speaker 0: He probably fell off one.

357
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:31,509
Speaker 1: No.

358
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,260
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of video evidence that he's been gaining a lot of weight.

359
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,819
Speaker 0: Well, wouldn't you if you were eating the whole country's worth of food and everyone else was starving?

360
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,220
Speaker 1: I have access to infinite numbers of calories compared to what my body could consume.

361
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,458
Speaker 1: I ate seven or eight hundred calories of cookies right before we did the show and I'm drinking a beer.

362
00:14:53,060 --> 00:15:01,200
Speaker 1: I consume as much calorie as I can on an hourly basis and I've weighed 150 pounds since like I was 16.

363
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,719
Speaker 0: Right, but he's eating food for an entire country of people to make sure that they continue to starve.

364
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:07,259
Speaker 0: That's a lot more than 700 calories.

365
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,800
Speaker 1: In a way, that noble man is protecting his people from obesity and type 2 diabetes.

366
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,800
Speaker 0: Yes, instead giving them things like scurvy.

367
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:19,920
Speaker 1: I would love to talk about Ukraine, but you don't know or care.

368
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,519
Speaker 1: I need Andrew.

369
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:22,320
Speaker 1: Andrew's my Ukraine buddy.

370
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,158
Speaker 0: Don't go there.

371
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:26,160
Speaker 0: Any place that's in the news is usually a place you don't want to go.

372
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,479
Speaker 0: That's my news.

373
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:28,800
Speaker 0: Oh, that's my advice.

374
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,020
Speaker 1: Oh, trying to think of an exception to that.

375
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,619
Speaker 1: PAX isn't really in the news.

376
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,440
Speaker 1: New York Comic Con is in the news and you don't want to go to that.

377
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,219
Speaker 1: It holds out.

378
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,155
Speaker 1: It holds up.

379
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:42,139
Speaker 0: Usually 9 times out of 10 or even more than that.

380
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,000
Speaker 0: If a place of a location is in the news, don't go there.

381
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,840
Speaker 1: So anyway, things of the day.

382
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:54,359
Speaker 1: This is cute and weird.

383
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:56,439
Speaker 1: So bear with me here.

384
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,660
Speaker 1: There is a pop song apparently called Anaconda that I'd never heard of.

385
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,720
Speaker 0: I didn't hear this either, but apparently it's just a Sir Mix-A-Lot remix.

386
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:08,035
Speaker 0: Yes, so it's basically Sir Mix-A-Lot, but with girls.

387
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:12,980
Speaker 1: It's not the greatest thing in the world.

388
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,200
Speaker 1: But the reason I found out about it is because CollegeHumor posted Anaconda, the educational version.

389
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:27,319
Speaker 0: So I saw this and I thought it was just a remix of Sir Mix-A-Lot because I didn't know that it was a remix of a remix of Sir Mix-A-Lot.

390
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,677
Speaker 1: So that is very much like the people who quote the phrase, "We don't need no stinking

391
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:34,359
Speaker 1: badges."

392
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:36,280
Speaker 1: And they don't know where it's from.

393
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,040
Speaker 1: That is from Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

394
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,559
Speaker 0: They think it's from Blazing Saddle.

395
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:42,799
Speaker 1: Actually, I've seen conversations.

396
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:46,280
Speaker 0: Which it is from, but it's also from Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

397
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:49,480
Speaker 1: I witnessed a conversation several years ago at a convention.

398
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,855
Speaker 1: The conversation went like this, "We don't need no stinking

399
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:53,398
Speaker 1: badges.".

400
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,113
Speaker 1: And then the guy was like, "Ah, The

401
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:58,037
Speaker 1: Simpsons.".

402
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:02,111
Speaker 1: And the guy was like, "Uh, no.

403
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:03,457
Speaker 1: It's from Blazing

404
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:03,979
Speaker 1: Saddles.".

405
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,698
Speaker 1: And then this other guy who was sitting nearby at a table looks up and he's like, "You two are

406
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:10,339
Speaker 1: children.".

407
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,740
Speaker 1: And he did not explain what he meant by that.

408
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,960
Speaker 0: That is the person that you should sit down and have a conversation with.

409
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,400
Speaker 1: That's the person you go sit and play Hanabi with right away.

410
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:19,997
Speaker 0: That's right.

411
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:25,498
Speaker 0: Anyone who has listened to this who has not seen Treasure of the Sierra Madre, that movie is...

412
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,429
Speaker 1: So anyway, this is a parody of a song.

413
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,535
Speaker 1: that is a remix of a song.

414
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,260
Speaker 1: And it's kind of cute and funny because it's basically just a sexy, rappy kind of music video.

415
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,260
Speaker 1: Except it's literally about anacondas, the snakes, and sexual dimorphism.

416
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:49,558
Speaker 1: And it's just... I don't know.

417
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:53,980
Speaker 1: All my other things of the day would require way too much explanation.

418
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,400
Speaker 1: And I gotta save them for an appropriate... Like, I need them to segue into something.

419
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,240
Speaker 0: So, continuing my hockey-themed things of the day this week.

420
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:03,519
Speaker 0: Here's another hockey-themed thing of the day.

421
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,440
Speaker 0: The Dallas Stars, who are not very good at hockey right now.

422
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,999
Speaker 0: Not the worst!

423
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,500
Speaker 0: No, I mean, you know, it's still pre-season hockey.

424
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,357
Speaker 0: We don't know how... They could suddenly be great this year.

425
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:12,780
Speaker 0: Unlikely.

426
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,479
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, Scott, I read a headline today.

427
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:17,549
Speaker 1: And it was basically like, "Rangers!

428
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:20,097
Speaker 1: Not seeing the Stanley Cup this

429
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:20,398
Speaker 1: year!".

430
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,486
Speaker 0: No kidding.

431
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:26,100
Speaker 0: It's pretty much probably going to be the West again.

432
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,937
Speaker 0: Because all the good players are still in the West.

433
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:28,260
Speaker 0: Anyway.

434
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:44,420
Speaker 0: So, the Dallas Stars, during their pre-season hockey game, on the scoreboard, put up memes that came up with making fun of the fans of opposing teams that were in the stands.

435
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,046
Speaker 1: The winter is coming one is great.

436
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:46,950
Speaker 1: Brace yourselves.

437
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,320
Speaker 1: Bandwagon Blackhawks fans are coming.

438
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:51,771
Speaker 1: You know what this is?

439
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,140
Speaker 1: This is Anime News Nina.

440
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,479
Speaker 1: For those of you who don't listen to the Anime Night.

441
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,420
Speaker 1: The Anime News Network, which is pretty much the Reuters press of anime.

442
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,399
Speaker 1: Well, in an English-speaking world.

443
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:06,340
Speaker 1: Like, outside of Japan.

444
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:13,500
Speaker 0: If you want anime news, or news about anime, manga, Japan stuff in the US, Anime News Network is the place.

445
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,770
Speaker 1: It is pretty much the top.

446
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:16,060
Speaker 1: Like, the top top.

447
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:19,209
Speaker 1: One step under that is, like, Anime World Order.

448
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:22,240
Speaker 1: Another step under that is, like, Oz and Dave and Joel.

449
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:23,760
Speaker 0: Uh, Taku USA Magazine?

450
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:31,640
Speaker 1: Uh, I put them on the level of... Halfway between Anime News Network and Anime World Order.

451
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,699
Speaker 1: Because there's a Venn diagram at that point.

452
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:33,986
Speaker 0: Anyway.

453
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:34,821
Speaker 1: Anyway.

454
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:40,400
Speaker 1: But they had a comic, Anime News Nina, that was pretty sardonic and funny.

455
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,620
Speaker 1: But the point was that it made fun of itself and of the thing that the organization was about.

456
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,280
Speaker 1: It's like the company making fun of itself and making the kind of humor that might offend really offendable people.

457
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:55,119
Speaker 1: But is actually funny.

458
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:56,443
Speaker 1: This is that.

459
00:19:56,765 --> 00:20:00,060
Speaker 1: This is the kind of thing that I wish more everythings did.

460
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:01,587
Speaker 1: Actually be funny.

461
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,060
Speaker 1: Don't be completely corporate lame humor.

462
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,260
Speaker 1: And also just don't be, like, racist and sexist.

463
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,600
Speaker 0: Just hire young people and let them have control and don't put stupid restrictions on them or punish them for being cool.

464
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:11,960
Speaker 1: Yeah.

465
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:21,289
Speaker 1: Because seriously, if you're old, like, over the age of 40, and you're 21 year old, like, just out of college, motion graphics guy says, "Trust me, this is

466
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:21,831
Speaker 1: hilarious.".

467
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:24,040
Speaker 1: I guarantee it is hilarious.

468
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:26,600
Speaker 1: At least to the people who are at your hockey game.

469
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,800
Speaker 0: Just verify that it's not also offensive.

470
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:29,543
Speaker 1: Yeah.

471
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:34,160
Speaker 1: Because the other problem with that person is that he is trying to sneak the goatee in.

472
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:34,783
Speaker 0: That's right.

473
00:20:34,804 --> 00:20:36,540
Speaker 0: There could be a hidden goatee there.

474
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,679
Speaker 1: You know how hard I'm trying to sneak the goatee into everything I ever do?

475
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:41,700
Speaker 0: Have you snuck the goatee into anything at work?

476
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:45,339
Speaker 1: No, I have not, but I've snuck a whole bunch of pony in.

477
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:45,840
Speaker 1: Alright.

478
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,959
Speaker 1: Lots of pones.

479
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:49,259
Speaker 0: Metamoments?

480
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,923
Speaker 0: In the metamoment.

481
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:51,413
Speaker 1: The Book Club book is Can it Go for?

482
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:52,560
Speaker 1: Leave It, which we're going to talk about it.

483
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,740
Speaker 0: What's the next Book Club book?

484
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,878
Speaker 1: I don't know.

485
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:55,760
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

486
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,400
Speaker 1: I'm debating whether or not to punish Scott for taking so long.

487
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
Speaker 0: Summer, would you want me to read books when the sun is out?

488
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:16,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, to be fair, it's a little one-sided because the reason I read seven novels since I finished Can it Go for Liebowitz, well, six and a half, I'm not done with the seventh one, is because I've had a number of transatlantic flights.

489
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:16,937
Speaker 0: On your own.

490
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:17,495
Speaker 0: Yes.

491
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:18,280
Speaker 0: With no one else.

492
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:30,999
Speaker 1: So, if you're not flying with a friend and you're flying, like, nine hours multiple times over the course of a month, you're going to read a lot of books because you can only watch so many cut-down shitty movies on the back of a headrest and your laptop only lasts a few hours.

493
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,720
Speaker 1: So, uh, I gotta pick a book and I gotta decide how much I want to punish Scott.

494
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,580
Speaker 0: Alright, so in the metamoment, I want to talk about just a few events that are happening in and around New York City and other nerdy places, I guess, mostly New York City.

495
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,260
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a secret burger crawl next weekend in New York City that you should go to.

496
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:50,438
Speaker 0: Okay, that's good to know.

497
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,849
Speaker 0: Yeah.

498
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:57,900
Speaker 0: So, most of these things are actually happening, like, October 11th, 12th, when we're at a wedding in Albany.

499
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,660
Speaker 0: It's Columbus Day weekend, I guess.

500
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:04,620
Speaker 0: Fuck Columbus Day, but, you know, that's a day off for work.

501
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,859
Speaker 0: Anyway, so here's the thing.

502
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:17,720
Speaker 0: So, first of all, because New York Comic Con is also that weekend, I'm pretty sure, there's a bunch of crazy nerdy events going on surrounding New York Comic Con that are vastly superior to New York Comic Con itself.

503
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,740
Speaker 0: So, I think the Ghibli movie is now screening in New York City.

504
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,160
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I think Emily might have bought tickets for that.

505
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,519
Speaker 0: Okay, that's number one.

506
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:38,480
Speaker 0: Number two, there's the Hatsune Miku Expo in New York City, which includes Hatsune Miku concert in the Nokia Theater, which is 11th and 12th, but then there's also this, like, art exhibit you can just go to, so we can go to that later.

507
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:39,499
Speaker 0: That's open for longer.

508
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,179
Speaker 0: There is New York City, this is unrelated to nerdery.

509
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:50,820
Speaker 0: It's like New York City open house, where you can sort of sign up and go to things that are normally not open.

510
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,018
Speaker 1: That's super nerdy.

511
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,041
Speaker 0: Sort of.

512
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:58,800
Speaker 0: So, I really wanted to go to the CWA terminal at JFK, which you can go to.

513
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,220
Speaker 0: I think you can also go to, like, Woolworth Building and other shit.

514
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,339
Speaker 1: I was thinking about going to the onion domes, the digesters.

515
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,088
Speaker 0: Oh, you can just go there.

516
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,000
Speaker 0: That's not a special day, but yeah, we can go there.

517
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:12,759
Speaker 0: So, the website to sign up for those things is open now, but I'm not gonna be here.

518
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,332
Speaker 0: And the last one, I don't think it's that weekend.

519
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:17,998
Speaker 0: I think it's maybe November 1st.

520
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,080
Speaker 0: I gotta check the actual date and provide a link at some point.

521
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,140
Speaker 0: I'll mention this one again, because there's more time between now and it.

522
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,722
Speaker 0: College Humor.

523
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:33,200
Speaker 0: Super Art Fight team up to bring you Super Art Fight vs College Humor in Brooklyn.

524
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:33,956
Speaker 1: Guys.

525
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,259
Speaker 0: Super Art Fight in Brooklyn for the first time ever.

526
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,920
Speaker 1: If you don't know what Super Art Fight is, go to this thing.

527
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:41,494
Speaker 1: If you know what it is, go to this thing.

528
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:42,400
Speaker 1: Seriously.

529
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:43,079
Speaker 0: It's happening.

530
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,479
Speaker 1: The College Humor team, like the people from College Humor.

531
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:51,440
Speaker 1: If anyone's gonna take down some of these long-reigning champions of Super Art Fight.

532
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,440
Speaker 0: I mean, Caldwell is not new to the Super Art Fight, you know, canvas.

533
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,220
Speaker 1: No, he is not, but I imagine Caldwell teamed up with, I'd have to pick who I'd team up with.

534
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,886
Speaker 1: You know what we need?

535
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:00,960
Speaker 1: You know what we should make?

536
00:24:01,661 --> 00:24:03,359
Speaker 1: Fantasy Super Art Fight League.

537
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:07,019
Speaker 0: You get points whenever they get a win.

538
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:07,411
Speaker 0: Yeah.

539
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,159
Speaker 0: Every time they draw a monocle, it scores a half point.

540
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,418
Speaker 0: Two points for a top hat.

541
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:13,664
Speaker 1: Yeah.

542
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:16,420
Speaker 1: Man, then you have a separate scoring system for, like, if someone does a webcomic.

543
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:21,400
Speaker 1: When those elements are included in the media they're publishing elsewhere, it's like the fantasy player.

544
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:24,139
Speaker 1: Someone else make that.

545
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:24,878
Speaker 0: Yeah.

546
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:28,900
Speaker 0: That's all the things I can think of right now, but I'm sure there's more going down.

547
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:34,300
Speaker 1: So, in a few weeks, October 31st through November 2nd, Halloween, the anniversary of Geek Nights.

548
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:38,220
Speaker 1: I will be live at PAX Australia without Scott.

549
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,079
Speaker 0: Unless someone wants to give me, like, a real lot of money right now.

550
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,420
Speaker 0: It's still theoretically possible if I'm given enough money in some currency.

551
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,060
Speaker 0: What's the number?

552
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,680
Speaker 0: That is legit.

553
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,260
Speaker 1: Would you go if someone gave you two grand?

554
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:49,879
Speaker 0: Well, no.

555
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:50,956
Speaker 1: Two grand would...

556
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:52,280
Speaker 0: I need a price of a plane ticket.

557
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,820
Speaker 1: I'm saying two grand would cover the plane tickets.

558
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:04,300
Speaker 0: Alright, and then I need a hotel to stay there, and then enough money to go from PAX, because I'm basically, if I'm going to go there, I'm going to go to PAX Aus, and then leave Melbourne immediately to go to the coral reef area.

559
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,093
Speaker 1: See, I'm landing in Sydney first, and I'm doing a professional conference.

560
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,200
Speaker 1: I'm lecturing, actually, on games at that.

561
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,436
Speaker 1: So, I'm doing a lecture called, I think, Games, Trades, Regulation.

562
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:15,040
Speaker 1: I forget what I'm doing.

563
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,479
Speaker 1: I've got to make slides for that.

564
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,260
Speaker 0: But, yeah, I want to go to PAX Aus, basically, like, a day before.

565
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,680
Speaker 0: See, you know, see the Melbourne stuff that now I'm familiar with.

566
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,160
Speaker 1: Yup.

567
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:23,540
Speaker 0: Right?

568
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:26,300
Speaker 1: I'm going to go to Wilson's fucking Promontory this time.

569
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:26,860
Speaker 1: Sure.

570
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:31,200
Speaker 0: And I'm going to go to PAX Aus, and then I want to go to the coral reef area, which is far away.

571
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,955
Speaker 1: Uh-oh, I typed Wilson's into Google, and it didn't say Promontory.

572
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,320
Speaker 1: It said, uh, disease.

573
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,025
Speaker 0: Great.

574
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:37,619
Speaker 0: Don't get that.

575
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:39,480
Speaker 0: Uh, just like, don't get your bullet.

576
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,240
Speaker 0: Go to the coral reef, hang out there for, like, a week or two, and then come back.

577
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,359
Speaker 0: So, that's how much money I need.

578
00:25:44,482 --> 00:25:45,200
Speaker 1: Oh, also known as the prom.

579
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:47,480
Speaker 0: And to make up for the money I'm going to lose not working.

580
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,640
Speaker 1: Wilson's Promontory, also known as the prom, is Victoria's most loved place.

581
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:52,319
Speaker 0: Sure.

582
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:52,745
Speaker 1: Huh.

583
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:53,684
Speaker 1: Ooh.

584
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:55,459
Speaker 1: We really should have gone here.

585
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,520
Speaker 0: Well, you know, we were only there for so long.

586
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,380
Speaker 1: Take that Phillip Island hike we did and just multiply it by, like, a hundred.

587
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:01,735
Speaker 0: Uh, that's too long.

588
00:26:01,816 --> 00:26:02,040
Speaker 0: Alright.

589
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,860
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I will be at PAX Australia on Saturday presenting losing, and on Sunday presenting winning.

590
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,419
Speaker 0: I'll be in the United States chilling out, maybe streaming something, playing Netrunner, baking things.

591
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:20,674
Speaker 0: Someone at work today said, "Put cheddar cheese on an apple pie," and I said, "Fuck

592
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:20,855
Speaker 0: no.".

593
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:26,059
Speaker 1: That, I would do Swiss if I was going to do that.

594
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:29,960
Speaker 1: No, I would do Port Salut.

595
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:31,819
Speaker 0: I would not do any cheese.

596
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,580
Speaker 1: Port Salut.

597
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,760
Speaker 0: The only dairy product that belongs in apple pie is an ice cream.

598
00:26:37,203 --> 00:26:38,419
Speaker 1: So, in Albany, right?

599
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:44,940
Speaker 1: Pete and Nury, they asked me if I wanted apple pie, and then they looked at each other like he doesn't know.

600
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:49,100
Speaker 0: How would they have apple pie that would be gluten free?

601
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,640
Speaker 1: You can make apple pie that's gluten free.

602
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:51,040
Speaker 0: Okay.

603
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:53,620
Speaker 1: Pie crusts are actually one of the easier things to make gluten free.

604
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,179
Speaker 0: Why would you want a gluten free pie, though?

605
00:26:56,502 --> 00:26:57,815
Speaker 1: Apples are the primary part of the pie.

606
00:26:57,937 --> 00:26:58,260
Speaker 1: It's a good pie.

607
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,439
Speaker 0: Well, just have baked apples, then.

608
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:05,200
Speaker 1: So, instead of ice cream, they gave me white chocolate mousse.

609
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:06,579
Speaker 0: That's not a bad choice.

610
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:09,399
Speaker 1: It was dangerously good.

611
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:10,058
Speaker 1: Yeah.

612
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,499
Speaker 1: To the point that I ate so much.

613
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,679
Speaker 0: Was it actual white chocolate, or?

614
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,080
Speaker 1: It was actual white chocolate.

615
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,306
Speaker 1: Whoa.

616
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,223
Speaker 1: White chocolate mousse.

617
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:18,460
Speaker 1: It was so thick with caloric joy.

618
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:20,500
Speaker 0: Where do you get white chocolate mousse from?

619
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:23,280
Speaker 1: A mother makes it, is how you get that.

620
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,179
Speaker 0: That's how you get that.

621
00:27:25,662 --> 00:27:28,460
Speaker 0: That mother doesn't have accurate recipes that I can follow.

622
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,296
Speaker 1: In fact, I asked, "What's the

623
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:31,519
Speaker 1: recipe?"

624
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,798
Speaker 1: Which was followed by more laughter and, "Will you take some amount of

625
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:36,060
Speaker 1: cream?".

626
00:27:36,182 --> 00:27:36,840
Speaker 0: That's right.

627
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:38,719
Speaker 0: I don't know.

628
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:39,779
Speaker 0: I can get the internet.

629
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,254
Speaker 0: The internet will help.

630
00:27:47,743 --> 00:27:49,259
Speaker 1: So, the book club.

631
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:52,380
Speaker 1: A canticle for Leibowitz, which Scott chose.

632
00:27:52,741 --> 00:28:04,539
Speaker 0: So, I chose this because, based on my knowledge of it, I thought it was in the genre of, it is a post-apocalyptic story, which it is, where specifically society has been sealed in.

633
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:11,180
Speaker 0: Such as in Logan's Run, or Phoenix Future, or Fallout, where the character, you're in a vault.

634
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,019
Speaker 1: Well, knowledge was sealed in.

635
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,365
Speaker 0: Yes.

636
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:18,539
Speaker 0: So, in the first chapter, it sort of is in that genre, right?

637
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:23,160
Speaker 0: Where it's about monks in a monastery that's far away from everything else.

638
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,460
Speaker 0: They're basically sealed.

639
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:30,440
Speaker 0: They encounter a vault where people were sealed at one point.

640
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:35,620
Speaker 0: But really, it's not about a society that is sealed in.

641
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,280
Speaker 0: It's about something completely different.

642
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,760
Speaker 0: So, I think it is not actually in that genre.

643
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,740
Speaker 1: I'm going to start off by saying that.

644
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,200
Speaker 1: It is definitely post-apocalyptic.

645
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,838
Speaker 0: It is the most post-apocalyptic.

646
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:48,860
Speaker 1: And it is one of the earlier instances of what we would call modern post-apocalyptic.

647
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,008
Speaker 1: Because I've heard most apocalypse stories before.

648
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:56,580
Speaker 1: books like this were floods, and mythology, and those kinds of things.

649
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:06,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a pretty typical old-school sci-fi book in a post-apocalypse on Earth with a dystopian society and whatnot.

650
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:13,280
Speaker 1: Arguably, I guess, Mary Shelley's The Last Man is the first work in this genre of post-apocalypse.

651
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,440
Speaker 1: mechanical for liebowitz is widely regarded to be one of the earliest modern takes.

652
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,000
Speaker 1: A lot of people point to this as being the precursor.

653
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,000
Speaker 1: Like, a lot of books are based on this book in some fashion.

654
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,860
Speaker 1: Though, I suspect that that number is dwindling because this book seems to be increasingly unknown.

655
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:31,822
Speaker 0: I don't know.

656
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:32,909
Speaker 0: I heard more about it.

657
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:33,653
Speaker 0: That's why it came up.

658
00:29:33,694 --> 00:29:34,740
Speaker 0: It came up in so many places.

659
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,282
Speaker 1: I don't know.

660
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:38,458
Speaker 1: It seems to come up in the same circles that a lot of our Book Club books come up in.

661
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,420
Speaker 1: That is not pop nerd culture at all.

662
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:52,160
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the book is really sort of these three books that are loosely tied together, covering three periods in history of this post-apocalypse world.

663
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,800
Speaker 0: So the first one is still long after the apocalypse, but not so long after it.

664
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,100
Speaker 0: The second part is hundreds of years after that.

665
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:03,160
Speaker 1: It's like Renaissance, and then Space Future.

666
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,816
Speaker 0: And then the third part is way after the apocalypse.

667
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,314
Speaker 1: Now, if you guys read it, it's the Book Club.

668
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,039
Speaker 1: Spoilers.

669
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,159
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about the book and assume you read it.

670
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:18,760
Speaker 1: So if you didn't read A Canticle for Leibowitz, you should go read it before you listen, because we're not going to explain any of the plot.

671
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:20,318
Speaker 1: We're assuming you read it.

672
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:25,540
Speaker 1: Also, I read it a long-ass time ago, so my memory might be fuzzy.

673
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,960
Speaker 1: I already lost -- like, I had a bunch of specific parts I wanted to quote.

674
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,240
Speaker 1: I don't remember any of that anymore.

675
00:30:30,486 --> 00:30:31,040
Speaker 0: That's okay.

676
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:44,800
Speaker 1: But if I had to summarize it, the moral of the first one, the Fiat Homo, is basically the church survives Renaissance dark ages, humans always have dark ages.

677
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:46,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

678
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,220
Speaker 1: And then monks in monasteries and staticness.

679
00:30:49,400 --> 00:31:01,340
Speaker 1: The feeling of Fiat Homo, it feels like it's the idea of being static, that whenever there's a dark age, whenever society falls behind, parts of it wall themselves off, and they can't innovate.

680
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,940
Speaker 1: They become entirely static.

681
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,100
Speaker 1: So these monks, generation by generation, nothing changes.

682
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,859
Speaker 1: Nothing changes.

683
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:16,220
Speaker 1: That chapter drills it into your head that fucking nothing has happened as far back as anyone can remember.

684
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:25,360
Speaker 0: Right, he's making a commentary on the history of our existing world by showing you this new history of a world that happens after our world ends.

685
00:31:26,462 --> 00:31:31,700
Speaker 0: A human society emerges after ours, presumably the real one that we live in now, ends.

686
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,640
Speaker 0: And then it's like, oh, it goes through the same exact shit that this one went through.

687
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:44,080
Speaker 0: And the first chapter goes through the dark age where there is still some sort of intelligence, but really it's a dark age and there isn't any overall.

688
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,360
Speaker 0: So the people who have it need to wall off and protect it and weather the storm.

689
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,919
Speaker 1: It's static and ritualized.

690
00:31:52,743 --> 00:32:08,177
Speaker 1: The spores of society become static, become unchanging, become ritualized, and their only purpose is to replicate that data such to the point that when society catches up to where they can understand its meaning, you get chapter two.

691
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:10,699
Speaker 0: In a way, they're a time capsule.

692
00:32:13,086 --> 00:32:14,858
Speaker 1: That story was actually my favorite.

693
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:18,319
Speaker 1: I enjoyed the book less as it went on.

694
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:19,480
Speaker 0: I agree.

695
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:20,511
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess I cared less.

696
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:29,300
Speaker 1: I like the interplay between the guy who runs the monastery and the main character because the main character was way smarter than everyone gave him credit for.

697
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,279
Speaker 0: But he was so humble.

698
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:31,060
Speaker 1: Exactly.

699
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,015
Speaker 0: But the other thing, that first chapter, I think the other reason I liked it more is because it gives you the world-building.

700
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,719
Speaker 0: The second and third chapters, the world has already been built by the first chapter, so they sort of just take it for granted.

701
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:43,980
Speaker 0: Whereas the first one's a bit longer.

702
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:49,940
Speaker 0: It's sort of explaining to you, introducing you to this post-apocalyptic world, and that part is just really interesting.

703
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,436
Speaker 0: So you're like, "Oh, it went down like

704
00:32:51,477 --> 00:32:51,679
Speaker 0: this.".

705
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:58,100
Speaker 1: It's definitely, I believe, the first novel like this to use in this post-apocalypse.

706
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:01,720
Speaker 1: the idea of the reader knows more than the characters.

707
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:09,880
Speaker 1: So there's one point where they're obviously referring to resistors, like the resistors that actually most of you Geek Guys listeners have probably never seen.

708
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,680
Speaker 1: So that reference would be lost.

709
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:24,328
Speaker 1: But the kinds of resistors I played with when I was a kid that I'd buy at Radio Shack with little colored bands, there are a lot of references like that that are obviously looking to the reader and going, "You know what these are.

710
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,955
Speaker 1: You know what's going

711
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:26,677
Speaker 1: on.".

712
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:32,639
Speaker 1: And I see that trope used a lot recently in stories like this.

713
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,720
Speaker 0: He's making a bunch of little points along the way.

714
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:40,615
Speaker 0: When he's talking about the blueprints, like, "Why did they put white on

715
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:41,117
Speaker 0: blue?"

716
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,375
Speaker 0: It's like, "It makes no

717
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:43,699
Speaker 0: sense.".

718
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:51,440
Speaker 0: And he's coloring in the whole thing, trying to reproduce, just assuming that the people from the ancient pre-apocalypse smarter times knew better.

719
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,385
Speaker 1: I mean, think.

720
00:33:52,546 --> 00:34:03,660
Speaker 1: Say I didn't know anything about computers and I found a computer in a post-apocalypse and I was trying to make it work again and make a new one, I would copy it exactly, not understanding why I was doing what I was doing.

721
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,418
Speaker 0: And do a lot of things that are dumb and be like, "Why did they do it this

722
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:07,700
Speaker 0: way?".

723
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,275
Speaker 0: It's like, "Well, because there's other things you don't

724
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:09,476
Speaker 0: know.".

725
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:17,239
Speaker 0: It's just interesting to think about recovering, just having the artifacts and then trying to recover the knowledge.

726
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:24,600
Speaker 0: That's what we do with archaeology in this world, when we look at ancient artifacts from some old civilization.

727
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:35,119
Speaker 0: We think we get it right, but you look at them and it's like, "Oh, it's obvious he's doing archaeology on our artifacts and look at him fucking

728
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:35,280
Speaker 0: up.".

729
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,279
Speaker 0: But it's sort of obvious how he fucks up, but we're fucking up in that same way with the archaeology that we do.

730
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:49,719
Speaker 0: We're probably much better at it than them because we are more advanced, looking at something less advanced, but even so.

731
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:58,280
Speaker 1: In a way, I found this interesting because most of the stories I read like this, the future society doesn't understand that the past was more advanced.

732
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,920
Speaker 1: In this story, every character is like, they know pretty much what went down.

733
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:06,860
Speaker 1: They know that there was a nuclear war.

734
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,619
Speaker 1: They understand the danger of those things.

735
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,699
Speaker 0: It's sort of like Adventure Time, like the Mushroom War.

736
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,619
Speaker 0: They have funny names for it, but they sort of know.

737
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:25,900
Speaker 1: How Liebowitzch is basically just like this nuclear engineer, just worked in the facility and had some personal drama, and how he became a saint, and I like that whole story there.

738
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,852
Speaker 1: I was disappointed, however, that St.

739
00:35:29,872 --> 00:35:32,858
Speaker 1: Liebowitzch was a legit supernatural entity, as far as I can tell.

740
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, from what I can tell, he was as well.

741
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:38,300
Speaker 1: That is the only part of this book I did not like.

742
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,157
Speaker 0: It didn't really seem to matter too much because he hardly appears or does anything notable.

743
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you could try to make an argument about maybe it was an allegory or something, but I just don't see that having been Walter Miller's intent.

744
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:52,310
Speaker 0: No.

745
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:56,740
Speaker 1: I feel like these books were written semi-rambly.

746
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:11,779
Speaker 1: I feel like when he was writing them, he was exploring these ideas, and I think his main goal was just to impress upon people the cyclical nature of human society, and how we're on the edge of a dark age again.

747
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,020
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, this was written in a Cold War time.

748
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,684
Speaker 1: I mean, it was written in, what, 1960?

749
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:16,813
Speaker 0: Yeah.

750
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:21,680
Speaker 1: That was one of the most dangerous times in all of human history.

751
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,940
Speaker 0: Right, so he's writing like, "Don't have nuclear war, guys," and that was the time that we could have had it.

752
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,640
Speaker 1: But at the same time, he was almost arguing that it's inevitable.

753
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it wasn't yet.

754
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,339
Speaker 1: Because look at the third part at the end.

755
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:35,840
Speaker 1: The spaceship goes into space.

756
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,080
Speaker 1: It's a monastery in space now because the second chapter will always happen.

757
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:54,120
Speaker 1: The Fiat Lux, the second chapter is basically suddenly the world catches up, and smart people can figure out what this shit all meant, but how the monasteries on their own were not capable of doing it on their own.

758
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,000
Speaker 1: They were only doing it for academic purpose.

759
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:04,019
Speaker 1: Someone has a practical purpose, and suddenly the world advances very quickly, and then the third chapter is they're going to nuke again and monastery in space.

760
00:37:05,242 --> 00:37:07,531
Speaker 0: You wonder, was there a monastery in space the first time, right?

761
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:23,660
Speaker 0: Because this is the second nuclear war that happens on this planet Earth, this fictional Earth, and the second one, they have nukes, and they have spaceships at the same time, and the first one, didn't they have spaceships and nukes at the same time or not?

762
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:35,159
Speaker 1: If it was written in 1960, at that time, we did not have spaceships that were really capable of anything like that, and it seems like the nuclear war happened around that time.

763
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:42,260
Speaker 1: They had not gotten too far, as far as I could tell, technologically, beyond what was predicted in the near future.

764
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:48,500
Speaker 0: The technology in that third chapter is a bit weird, where some things are way advanced, like you can just walk onto the spaceship in your sandals.

765
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,477
Speaker 1: But his conception of a computer.

766
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,259
Speaker 0: It has a nuclear drive, and you can just go.

767
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:56,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, the computer is like ENIAC, and it draws instead of having a monitor.

768
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,299
Speaker 1: Well, that part made sense, because computers were kind of like that back then.

769
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:01,101
Speaker 0: But

770
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:21,540
Speaker 1: it's interesting how they implied a lot of highly advanced capabilities to a lot of other things, but computers, as he envisioned them, were not significantly advanced in any interesting way beyond what existed at that time, and yet simultaneously had a few powers that to this day are basically impossible.

771
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:30,940
Speaker 0: Right, but it's like he could somehow imagine technologies being super advanced in some aspects, but couldn't imagine them being advanced at all in other aspects.

772
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, though it seems like the space stuff was the only thing that was really super advanced.

773
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, the medicine wasn't advanced, really, at all.

774
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,580
Speaker 1: It was partly just because he needed that for his plot at the end, I think.

775
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,325
Speaker 0: I guess so.

776
00:38:43,346 --> 00:38:44,600
Speaker 0: Anyway.

777
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:48,640
Speaker 0: So, yeah, the first chapter is pretty much this dark age.

778
00:38:49,003 --> 00:38:54,457
Speaker 0: The second chapter is this renaissance, where people suddenly actually care what the monks are up to, right?

779
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,199
Speaker 0: But the monks are only inventing light bulbs and getting all Thomas Edison, because research.

780
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,280
Speaker 0: They don't actually want anyone to have light bulbs everywhere.

781
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,598
Speaker 0: But then, of course, the dude from far away comes, and he wants light bulbs everywhere, and he's like, "Oh,

782
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:08,780
Speaker 0: shit.".

783
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:32,040
Speaker 0: But the one thing in that chapter that actually stood out as interesting to me, because the rest of it was kind of eh, was the fact that it's like that guy, you know, the guy who thought he was the hot shit, I forget his name, he realized, you know, he was all proud of being a smart inventor, but because this was the second society, he was really only a discoverer.

784
00:39:32,281 --> 00:39:33,340
Speaker 0: He couldn't be an inventor.

785
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,660
Speaker 0: There was no way he could be an inventor of anything.

786
00:39:36,282 --> 00:39:38,980
Speaker 0: All he could do is rediscover things that were already invented.

787
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:40,577
Speaker 0: And it's like, whoa.

788
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:45,458
Speaker 0: Imagine, like, your whole life, you spend discovering shit, but it's like, no.

789
00:39:47,446 --> 00:39:57,100
Speaker 0: Your whole life has to go into this, and knowing that you put all this hard work in, but there were previous people who were way ahead of you, and you will never catch up to them ever.

790
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:58,018
Speaker 0: There's no chance.

791
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:01,980
Speaker 0: And all you're doing is you're discovering and not actually inventing.

792
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,201
Speaker 1: Yup.

793
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:13,719
Speaker 1: And also, simultaneously there, the idea that if secular, there's definitely this vibe that if secular, pragmatic uses of technology are brought about, nuclear war is inevitable again.

794
00:40:14,363 --> 00:40:15,477
Speaker 1: There's no way around that.

795
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,915
Speaker 1: That's definitely heavily implied by the way the book is put together.

796
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:30,780
Speaker 1: Though, the third chapter felt really rambly, like the section about whether or not to let the woman commit suicide.

797
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:31,123
Speaker 0: Right.

798
00:40:31,184 --> 00:40:32,137
Speaker 0: I mean, like, half--.

799
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,940
Speaker 1: It really zoomed in on that for a long time.

800
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:42,540
Speaker 0: So that third part is like 50% nuclear war, and 50% let's talk about abortion and euthanasia.

801
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:43,899
Speaker 0: And it's like, what?

802
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:46,980
Speaker 0: Was he trying to tie them together?

803
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,700
Speaker 0: Because he really didn't tie them together at all.

804
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,080
Speaker 0: They were just sort of like two separate topics.

805
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,000
Speaker 1: The best way I could tie them together, this is kind of--.

806
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,320
Speaker 0: Does he want to say that God is punishing everyone with nuclear war?

807
00:40:57,381 --> 00:40:57,685
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

808
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:58,700
Speaker 1: This is kind of a stretch.

809
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:18,800
Speaker 1: So here's the way, if I were in high school, and I had to write a paper on this book, what I would say is that the woman deciding whether or not to euthanize herself and her child is basically an allegory for society, because the woman knows she will die horribly.

810
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:23,580
Speaker 1: Society knows if it continues, it will nuke itself.

811
00:41:24,841 --> 00:41:35,860
Speaker 1: Her choice is to stop the cycle and not exist, or accept her fate and die by the nuclear flame, knowing that society will be rewarded.

812
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,099
Speaker 1: That's where the analogy starts to break down already, because her kid won't survive if she does that.

813
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,380
Speaker 1: But at the same time, if everybody committed suicide, there'd never be another nuclear war.

814
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,959
Speaker 1: If society did not advance, if the second chapter didn't happen, you can never have a nuclear war.

815
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,440
Speaker 1: But it's hard to say what the author was advocating.

816
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,359
Speaker 0: Well, he's definitely advocating against nuclear war.

817
00:41:58,045 --> 00:41:59,820
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone's advocating for nuclear war.

818
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:02,840
Speaker 1: But was he pro- or anti-euthanasia, the author?

819
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,839
Speaker 1: Because the character, the priest, was against it.

820
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:07,999
Speaker 0: And the priest stayed against it.

821
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,819
Speaker 0: It wasn't one of those obvious ones where the priest sees the light at the end.

822
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:16,880
Speaker 1: And also, the whole thing was futile at that point anyway.

823
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:22,560
Speaker 1: And the priest was not portrayed terribly sympathetically in the book.

824
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,220
Speaker 1: He's kind of portrayed as this old, crufty priest.

825
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:36,079
Speaker 0: Well, the first thing they say in that third chapter is, "Yeah, this abbot was quick to action and didn't sit around thinking about things for a long

826
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:36,280
Speaker 0: time.".

827
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:43,000
Speaker 0: And the other ones in the first two chapters were the kind of person who would think, and is very impulsive and whatnot.

828
00:42:43,421 --> 00:42:45,720
Speaker 0: And then you see him exhibiting those characteristics.

829
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,640
Speaker 1: Him and the church are kind of portrayed as adding to the suffering here.

830
00:42:50,222 --> 00:42:52,939
Speaker 1: The book is very ambivalent on the issue.

831
00:42:53,844 --> 00:42:54,879
Speaker 1: At least as far as I could read.

832
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:57,719
Speaker 1: Again, this is going from- I read this a long time ago.

833
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,114
Speaker 0: But also, at the same time, they're the ones who are saving, I guess, whatever.

834
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:17,100
Speaker 0: But what I find interesting is that- So, in the very first chapter, they're all about protecting the memorabilia, the things from the first civilization that are so important.

835
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,360
Speaker 1: Because they know that one day they'll be able to figure out what they are.

836
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:20,959
Speaker 0: Exactly.

837
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,500
Speaker 0: At the end of the third chapter, they go into space again.

838
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,838
Speaker 0: And what do they bring with them?

839
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,380
Speaker 0: The shit from the first civilization.

840
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,800
Speaker 0: They didn't bring memorabilia from their own second civilization.

841
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,234
Speaker 0: Right?

842
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:39,195
Speaker 0: The history of the second civilization is just, like, unimportant.

843
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:45,660
Speaker 0: It's like the first civilization is the one that, I guess, matters.

844
00:43:47,163 --> 00:43:49,800
Speaker 0: Anything that happened in the second one, they couldn't even remember.

845
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:57,699
Speaker 0: They had all this history of the first civilization, but you see him lying there at the end, and he's got a bone with an arrow in it.

846
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,059
Speaker 0: It's clearly- we know who that is.

847
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,260
Speaker 1: What's his name from the first book?

848
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,580
Speaker 0: Right, but they don't have their own history down.

849
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,500
Speaker 0: They didn't record any of their own history.

850
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,800
Speaker 0: They were so obsessed with the history of that first civilization.

851
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,540
Speaker 1: Well, that's where this book gets complicated.

852
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:20,980
Speaker 1: Because there's a way to read this, I think, where if you look at the second chapter and really think about it, the church's preservation of the previous era was irrelevant.

853
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,340
Speaker 1: Those smart people were discovering these things and inventing them.

854
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,120
Speaker 1: The only reason they couldn't invent new things is because the knowledge already existed.

855
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,680
Speaker 1: But look at how far they'd gotten before they got access to that memorabilia.

856
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:41,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy was on the verge of lightbulb, and they only barely beat him to the punch on lightbulb because they had the memorabilia.

857
00:44:41,683 --> 00:44:42,860
Speaker 0: It was barely helpful.

858
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:49,040
Speaker 1: Whether or not it's intentional, this book is arguing that the preservation aspect of the church is irrelevant.

859
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,716
Speaker 0: As long as you preserved humans, right?

860
00:44:53,064 --> 00:44:54,600
Speaker 0: And they can live and have resources.

861
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,452
Speaker 0: They're going to figure out the same things humans figured out again with just enough time.

862
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:09,040
Speaker 1: I don't know if the author intended this to be read this way, but it's very easy to interpret this book as though- Doesn't matter what the author intended, right?

863
00:45:09,564 --> 00:45:11,540
Speaker 1: I think this is the one case where it does.

864
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:24,640
Speaker 1: Not the one case, but the reason I think it matters is that the book is obviously the author exploring these ideas at a time when the world is literally actually dealing with these ideas.

865
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,741
Speaker 0: Right.

866
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:29,760
Speaker 0: If we were in the '60s, this book would be a completely different read if we read it when it was written.

867
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:31,867
Speaker 0: Yes, because in the '60s- What is this book?

868
00:45:31,887 --> 00:45:32,714
Speaker 0: We don't care about the '60s.

869
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,268
Speaker 0: We care about today.

870
00:45:34,288 --> 00:45:35,499
Speaker 0: We don't care about then.

871
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:37,118
Speaker 0: Then doesn't matter to us.

872
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:39,032
Speaker 0: We're reading this book.

873
00:45:39,053 --> 00:45:39,760
Speaker 0: We're alive today.

874
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:41,140
Speaker 0: That's what is important.

875
00:45:41,562 --> 00:45:44,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also, I was reading his history.

876
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,716
Speaker 1: He converted to Catholicism after the war.

877
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:59,120
Speaker 1: I think he was a tail gunner and a radio man in bombers, and he bombed a Catholic church as part of his duties being a bomber.

878
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,160
Speaker 1: Some other guy said- That's definitely irrelevant.

879
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,500
Speaker 1: That he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

880
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:06,451
Speaker 0: Makes sense.

881
00:46:06,694 --> 00:46:06,957
Speaker 0: I would too.

882
00:46:10,063 --> 00:46:19,020
Speaker 1: This is a man who saw the horrors of war, perpetuated them, not saying the war was bad or unjustified, but saying that he was a bomber.

883
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:19,876
Speaker 1: That's what he did.

884
00:46:21,662 --> 00:46:26,359
Speaker 1: He lived in the shadow of nuclear annihilation, and he wrote a book about it.

885
00:46:27,461 --> 00:46:32,360
Speaker 1: You cannot read this book, but in the context of the world at that time.

886
00:46:32,546 --> 00:46:32,778
Speaker 0: Sure.

887
00:46:33,263 --> 00:46:46,180
Speaker 1: Because a lot of the stuff in the third chapter, there's a lot of terminology that I think would not be recognized by kids today because kids today don't really think about nuclear war the way that our parents thought about it.

888
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:46,999
Speaker 0: Isn't that a good thing?

889
00:46:47,381 --> 00:46:48,859
Speaker 1: I think it is definitely a good thing.

890
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:57,640
Speaker 1: I feel like human society got to at least one major precipice, and we all collectively said, "Okay, guys, let's just back up a little

891
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:57,720
Speaker 1: bit.".

892
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,959
Speaker 0: Actually, I read something recently.

893
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,980
Speaker 0: The US was going to basically dismantle a bunch of nukes like we do because we don't really need them.

894
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:03,343
Speaker 1: And we didn't.

895
00:47:03,444 --> 00:47:04,699
Speaker 1: in case we have to blow up an asteroid.

896
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,559
Speaker 0: But you know what?

897
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,080
Speaker 0: I'm sure some nut out there is going to be like, "Oh, see?

898
00:47:09,862 --> 00:47:11,738
Speaker 0: They're just making up excuses to keep a bunch of nukes

899
00:47:11,778 --> 00:47:11,980
Speaker 0: around.".

900
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,099
Speaker 0: But actually, I kind of believe that.

901
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:13,411
Speaker 0: Yeah.

902
00:47:13,761 --> 00:47:17,360
Speaker 1: I feel like we should still keep the nukes that we have right now.

903
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,519
Speaker 0: I don't really believe that nukes are definitely going to save us from an asteroid, but what else do we have?

904
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:25,540
Speaker 0: I'd rather shoot them and try than just sit there and get hit by an asteroid.

905
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:30,560
Speaker 1: I still think we need to keep them from a complicated geopolitical game theory perspective.

906
00:47:30,743 --> 00:47:31,131
Speaker 0: Maybe.

907
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:31,375
Speaker 0: Sure.

908
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:31,640
Speaker 0: Whatever.

909
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:33,060
Speaker 1: That's a separate discussion.

910
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:34,059
Speaker 1: But think about it.

911
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:46,660
Speaker 1: We just read a book on the horrors of nuclear war and the inevitability of nuclear war so long as humans make nukes, yet I still feel like we should not destroy all the nukes we have because I don't trust everybody.

912
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:54,799
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the one thing in this book that really kind of -- I had no idea what it was there for, but it was fun -- is the poet guy.

913
00:47:55,182 --> 00:47:55,859
Speaker 1: That poet guy.

914
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,520
Speaker 0: That poet guy is kind of awesome.

915
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,000
Speaker 1: He reminded me of the poet in Hyperion.

916
00:48:00,202 --> 00:48:00,465
Speaker 1: He did.

917
00:48:00,646 --> 00:48:04,298
Speaker 0: We all felt like the Hyperion poet, and he felt like a little bit of choose goose going on.

918
00:48:05,605 --> 00:48:06,360
Speaker 0: I can see that.

919
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,360
Speaker 0: A little bit of choose goose.

920
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,280
Speaker 1: I can totally see that.

921
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,920
Speaker 0: I was kind of into him as a character.

922
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,660
Speaker 0: He was all cool and, you know, whatever.

923
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:22,020
Speaker 0: But at the same time, I couldn't understand what his meaning was to anything whatsoever, and then they bring him up again in the third chapter as sort of another one of those.

924
00:48:22,342 --> 00:48:27,660
Speaker 0: they don't know their own history, they don't remember who the poet was, you know, the poet of the eyeball or something.

925
00:48:28,507 --> 00:48:30,080
Speaker 0: What is the meaning of the glass eye?

926
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:30,979
Speaker 0: I have no fucking clue.

927
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:32,498
Speaker 0: I couldn't even guess.

928
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,740
Speaker 1: The eye of knowledge.

929
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:38,779
Speaker 1: I had a bunch of notes I wrote down, but they don't make sense to me now because I read the book a while ago.

930
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,320
Speaker 0: Right, and is there -- the only thing I could think of was like -- so the poet was sort of like the guy without an eye.

931
00:48:43,702 --> 00:48:47,860
Speaker 0: was the sort of poet character of the third chapter, the lady with two heads?

932
00:48:48,723 --> 00:48:49,834
Speaker 0: Was that sort of like the --?

933
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:52,380
Speaker 0: and then who was the poet character of the first chapter?

934
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:52,796
Speaker 0: I don't know.

935
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,939
Speaker 1: Well, the lady with two heads and the quote "miracle" there was interesting because -- That could have easily been a hallucination, too.

936
00:49:00,342 --> 00:49:00,430
Speaker 0: Yes.

937
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:06,260
Speaker 0: I was half -- you know, going on the hallucination -- or he was already in some sort of afterlife seeing that shit.

938
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,420
Speaker 1: So let's go yet again to reading this book in a particular way.

939
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:22,020
Speaker 1: So we have -- you know, Leibowitz becomes a saint, and there's this mythology around his life and his wife and all those things based on incomplete knowledge.

940
00:49:22,761 --> 00:49:26,200
Speaker 1: There's the skull of the guy who got shot with the arrow.

941
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:27,680
Speaker 1: There's all these legends -- the eye.

942
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:45,120
Speaker 1: The fact that the eye thing was, from a literal reading, a totally just generic -- you know, the guy just had the eye, and the famous guy tried to give it back to him and couldn't, and you can see how later there became a mythology around this completely mundane and kind of humorous event.

943
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:52,119
Speaker 1: A mundane and humorous event became a for real serious mythology once enough time had passed.

944
00:49:53,542 --> 00:50:17,019
Speaker 1: So the miracles of the Bible and all the times before these books even take place could easily be misinterpretations and failings of human memory from mundane events of that era, and him seeing that vision at the end could just be him hallucinating or interpreting something in a way that would make sense in light of his mythology.

945
00:50:18,904 --> 00:50:24,720
Speaker 1: There's a lot of ways to read this book that basically really put down religion, the church, and preservationism.

946
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,460
Speaker 0: For someone who converted to a Catholic.

947
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:34,700
Speaker 1: But even though on a surface level, I think people who read this book and don't think about it too much would say it says the exact opposite.

948
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:41,980
Speaker 0: A deeper read -- it's almost like -- I almost feel like -- You can read it either way, and maybe that was intentional, right?

949
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:54,900
Speaker 0: Whether you're Catholic or not or anything else, religious or non, you'll read it and you can basically feel like it was telling you that you're right, but it's always telling you you're right, nukes are bad.

950
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:02,120
Speaker 1: Yep, I found some essays where people very passionately argued opposite positions on whether or not the book was pro or anti-euthanasia.

951
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,160
Speaker 1: I think Luke Burge even posted some of that stuff.

952
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:05,958
Speaker 1: That's why I was reading it.

953
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:13,020
Speaker 0: But either way, it makes you think about it, and it presents pretty much all the arguments both ways.

954
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,439
Speaker 1: May I present a crazy idea?

955
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:21,580
Speaker 0: It presents religious arguments a lot, but it presents secular arguments in both directions as well.

956
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,600
Speaker 1: I wonder if Miller, writing this book -- Didn't have a firm conviction himself?

957
00:51:28,181 --> 00:51:38,080
Speaker 1: Or even if he thought he did, in actually exploring the idea, he went from optimistic to cynical in every chapter.

958
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:47,159
Speaker 1: That him writing, he started to see the flaws in the optimistic or religious arguments, and then started undermining them either consciously or not.

959
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:52,300
Speaker 1: Also, a note here about his life that might be relevant.

960
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,519
Speaker 0: It's going to be.

961
00:51:54,424 --> 00:51:58,580
Speaker 1: After the success of Mechanical for Leibovitz, Miller never published another novel or story in his lifetime.

962
00:51:58,947 --> 00:51:59,198
Speaker 0: Okay.

963
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:02,320
Speaker 0: In Miller's later years -- How successful was it when he wrote it?

964
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,197
Speaker 0: Really successful.

965
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:03,569
Speaker 0: Okay.

966
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:10,379
Speaker 1: He became a recluse, avoided his family, lived alone, never talked to his literary agent, never let him meet him.

967
00:52:10,904 --> 00:52:12,100
Speaker 0: He was protecting the memorabilia.

968
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:20,639
Speaker 1: Struggled with depression, wrote a 600-page manuscript as a sequel to Mechanical for Leibovitz, and then took his own life with a gun.

969
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:21,660
Speaker 0: Where's the manuscript?

970
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,040
Speaker 1: In 1996.

971
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,148
Speaker 1: The sequel, St.

972
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:29,761
Speaker 1: Leibovitz and the Wild Horsewoman, was completed and published in 1997.

973
00:52:29,761 --> 00:52:29,903
Speaker 0: Oh.

974
00:52:30,431 --> 00:52:31,080
Speaker 0: We should read the sequel.

975
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:31,887
Speaker 0: No, we shouldn't.

976
00:52:31,928 --> 00:52:32,497
Speaker 0: It's 600 pages.

977
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:41,400
Speaker 1: Set 80 years after the events of the second part, so it takes place between the second and third part, so I feel like this is gonna be a fall of Hyperion.

978
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,294
Speaker 0: I feel like there's no reason to read 600 pages.

979
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all about Texark stuff.

980
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:50,820
Speaker 0: That are written by a guy who is a crazy hermit in the woods.

981
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:57,300
Speaker 1: This looks like pulpy drama rather than serious exploration of nuclear holocaust.

982
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:02,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you sort of had that sort of, you know, that Texarkana.

983
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:04,319
Speaker 0: That really felt more like a fallout.

984
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,500
Speaker 0: Like, you could see hints of that coming in, the plot of a fallout kind of world.

985
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,159
Speaker 0: When they were talking about the different bandit groups out there.

986
00:53:15,122 --> 00:53:26,300
Speaker 0: There was this other universe where fallout kind of stuff was happening, but it was far away, and it only barely interacted with the characters of any of these chapters.

987
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:33,660
Speaker 1: So, I'm glad I read it, because it's such a precursor work to a lot of other things.

988
00:53:34,901 --> 00:53:37,079
Speaker 1: I don't know if I enjoyed it that much.

989
00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:41,019
Speaker 0: I mean, it didn't just take me a long time to read, because it was summertime.

990
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:47,260
Speaker 0: It's because any time I was sitting there, and there was a list of media to consume, it did not rank highly at any given moment.

991
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,399
Speaker 0: I mean, once I actually started, the first chapter went by pretty quickly.

992
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,839
Speaker 0: Then I didn't start the second one.

993
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:03,100
Speaker 0: And I feel actually the fact that it was split into chapters also sort of delayed the reading, because once I finished a chapter, it's like I didn't want to start the next one.

994
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,039
Speaker 0: But once I started one, I was able to go through it.

995
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,059
Speaker 1: But then again, look at books that are written, like The Prince of Nothing is an example.

996
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:11,979
Speaker 1: A lot of times, they're reading a chapter that follows a character, and I'm really invested in that.

997
00:54:12,501 --> 00:54:15,840
Speaker 1: And then the chapter ends, and the next chapter is about a character I don't care about.

998
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:17,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good time I'll stop.

999
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,840
Speaker 1: But, if I read more than one paragraph of that next page, Oh, forget it.

1000
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,599
Speaker 1: Now I'm invested.

1001
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:25,640
Speaker 0: And then, if you finish that chapter, it goes back to the other character.

1002
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,797
Speaker 1: And then you're like, "Oh shit, Ryan, I wonder what Kellis is up

1003
00:54:27,817 --> 00:54:27,918
Speaker 1: to.".

1004
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:28,333
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1005
00:54:30,145 --> 00:54:31,380
Speaker 0: But this is completely different.

1006
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:40,400
Speaker 0: It's like three stories in one that are barely, they're not barely related, but it's not like you're skipping around different characters at the same point in the same story.

1007
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:43,998
Speaker 0: It's really three short stories in the same universe with a tiny thread connecting them.

1008
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,359
Speaker 0: And each one makes a lot of subtle and disparate points.

1009
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,200
Speaker 1: I like Robotechs.

1010
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,880
Speaker 1: Well, look at when the guy, I keep thinking, it's maybe not Catterley, but I was thinking of him as Catterley, the smart dumb monk in the beginning.

1011
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:55,459
Speaker 0: Oh, I forget.

1012
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,540
Speaker 1: You don't remember his name either.

1013
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,540
Speaker 0: I don't remember names from people in books.

1014
00:54:58,601 --> 00:54:59,599
Speaker 1: He's surviving the war.

1015
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,839
Speaker 1: Albertian order of Leibovitz.

1016
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,540
Speaker 1: What's the guy's fucking name, Wikipedia?

1017
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,700
Speaker 1: What's the guy's fucking name?

1018
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,620
Speaker 1: Doesn't say whatever.

1019
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,359
Speaker 0: I can just look through the book here, but it's an e-book, so it's kind of hard.

1020
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:19,020
Speaker 1: So, reading the book from, just reading that first section, there's a bit about how he goes to the pope.

1021
00:55:20,203 --> 00:55:20,839
Speaker 0: Oh, yep, yep.

1022
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:36,860
Speaker 1: And that long section about how overwhelming the experience of being in that place is and how different it is from the monastery and how it overwhelms the senses and it's so large and powerful and thick with portents.

1023
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,999
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it's sort of run down.

1024
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:46,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then after he's not overwhelmed by it anymore and he talks to the pope, he realizes that it's not any different.

1025
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,739
Speaker 1: It's just more worldly.

1026
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,339
Speaker 1: Everything's run down.

1027
00:55:50,884 --> 00:55:56,980
Speaker 1: The symbols are more powerful than the reality and the idea that that's why people are hustled in and out.

1028
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:05,879
Speaker 1: The church has all this symbolic power, but no real power, but the symbolic power works unless you let people hang around too long or look too closely.

1029
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:17,880
Speaker 1: It also has the whole bit about, not iconoclasm, but the book-leggers trying to save knowledge from the fact that when the apocalypse happens, there's a lot of survivors.

1030
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:25,397
Speaker 1: It's a much more realistic nuclear war than most stories and the survivors destroy all knowledge because fuck those guys.

1031
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:30,119
Speaker 1: And that whole section has a lot of interesting ideas, but again, they're all over the place.

1032
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:35,760
Speaker 1: The rampaging mobs who call themselves simpletons, it's a lot like the Luddites.

1033
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's in a way, right?

1034
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,700
Speaker 0: The book is, again, you can find things in this book to support.

1035
00:56:43,341 --> 00:56:45,157
Speaker 0: Whoever wrote this book was a Luddite.

1036
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:47,000
Speaker 0: He wanted anti-technology.

1037
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,660
Speaker 0: You could also say the opposite.

1038
00:56:49,221 --> 00:56:52,960
Speaker 0: He shows how awesome all that technology is in the third chapter, except nukes.

1039
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,480
Speaker 1: He was a sad, disturbed, complicated person.

1040
00:56:55,881 --> 00:57:02,880
Speaker 1: Who had a complicated, evolving view of what all these things meant.

1041
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,419
Speaker 1: And this book is him exploring these ideas.

1042
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:06,839
Speaker 1: And that's all it is.

1043
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,820
Speaker 1: It's him exploring the ideas.

1044
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:13,040
Speaker 1: The book, the chapters don't end with like, "Oh, that is what I should think.

1045
00:57:13,344 --> 00:57:13,854
Speaker 1: That is the

1046
00:57:13,895 --> 00:57:14,140
Speaker 1: moral.".

1047
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,988
Speaker 1: The book ends with, "Wow, that's a lot of ideas and things are

1048
00:57:18,008 --> 00:57:18,633
Speaker 1: complicated.".

1049
00:57:19,987 --> 00:57:21,000
Speaker 1: So I guess I like it on that front.

1050
00:57:21,723 --> 00:57:24,939
Speaker 1: It's a lot like trying to interpret the man who was Thursday.

1051
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,091
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1052
00:57:27,108 --> 00:57:27,620
Speaker 1: In that regard.

1053
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,559
Speaker 0: Only a lot less action.

1054
00:57:29,982 --> 00:57:35,960
Speaker 1: Though at the same time, the action in The Man Who Was Thursday was largely incomprehensible, but that's just an artifact of the writing.

1055
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:37,877
Speaker 1: Thaddio.

1056
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:38,936
Speaker 1: That's the cool guy.

1057
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,557
Speaker 1: Thon Thaddio.

1058
00:57:41,162 --> 00:57:41,733
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1059
00:57:42,162 --> 00:57:42,919
Speaker 1: I like Thon Thaddio.

1060
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:43,777
Speaker 0: That's a good name, too.

1061
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:52,260
Speaker 1: I like how Thon Thaddio was, he realized the danger of what he was doing, but he did it anyway, but he tried to be honorable.

1062
00:57:53,244 --> 00:57:54,180
Speaker 1: He's just a fun character.

1063
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:54,929
Speaker 1: I liked him.

1064
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:56,760
Speaker 0: All right.

1065
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,479
Speaker 0: Is there anything else to say about this book?

1066
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,217
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

1067
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,800
Speaker 0: It's relatively short, actually.

1068
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,316
Speaker 0: I shouldn't have taken that long to read it if I actually tried.

1069
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,199
Speaker 0: I mean, once I started reading the third chapter, it took literally like a day.

1070
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,519
Speaker 0: Not even, like a couple hours.

1071
00:58:09,381 --> 00:58:12,840
Speaker 0: So you could probably read the book in eight hours total.

1072
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:13,820
Speaker 1: Yep, easily.

1073
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,510
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1074
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:27,610
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1075
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:33,010
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1076
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,970
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1077
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:40,689
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1079
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,510
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1080
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:51,650
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
