1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,486
Speaker 0: It's Monday January 19th.

2
00:00:11,787 --> 00:00:12,329
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,720
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight the overclocking.

4
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:34,475
Speaker 1: Well, I duly celebrated the day of the dr.

6
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:53,444
Speaker 1: Reverend Martin Luther King jr By going skiing which as a guy at the ski resort said to me when they were celebrating MLK day Celebrate the blackest day in the world in a good way because he was this awesome black guy By doing the whitest thing in the world This big black dude.

7
00:00:53,464 --> 00:01:00,303
Speaker 0: apparently that this awesome like I'm the only kind of guy because at the same time right it's like Skeeto is good.

8
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:04,275
Speaker 0: Dad's got the double meaning of skiing snow white.

9
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:18,949
Speaker 0: but also Stereotypically white people are way more skiing than black Even though obviously that is not a hundred percent true because there was a black guy at the ski resort This guy was one of those like his face.

10
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,094
Speaker 0: It wasn't a resort as a mountain.

11
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:21,240
Speaker 1: No, it's also a resort.

12
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:21,803
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

13
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:22,446
Speaker 0: Can you stay there?

14
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:23,289
Speaker 0: Yeah in the cabin.

15
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:28,480
Speaker 1: In fact it because of the economy It's you can get a nice condo like on the slopes.

16
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:33,774
Speaker 1: I don't want a condo on a log cabin for like the weekend Log cabin for the weekend is like a hundred bucks a person.

17
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:34,700
Speaker 1: really her night.

18
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:35,866
Speaker 0: Oh a per person.

19
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:39,780
Speaker 0: so ten people in one cabin is the same as ten people If you go in the normal ones.

20
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,067
Speaker 1: You can also rent just a cabin and it's not that much like maybe For four or five hundred bucks total.

21
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:48,340
Speaker 1: we can have it for as many people as we can cram in for like a whole weekend.

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,152
Speaker 0: See if you're all shushing, but I was sitting in the cabin going.

23
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,215
Speaker 0: I like having.

24
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:54,620
Speaker 1: actually they got this big.

25
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:56,477
Speaker 0: There's not much that I like.

26
00:01:56,517 --> 00:02:00,480
Speaker 1: better They got all these like indoor pool.

27
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,259
Speaker 0: I don't trust that because it might tip me out and spill me down the mountain while I'm sitting on the toilet.

28
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:09,359
Speaker 1: They also have for people who don't want to ski tubing with lifts.

29
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:11,283
Speaker 0: That's not too bad.

30
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:14,314
Speaker 1: you can like sled in two, but it's not even more dangerous though.

31
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:15,960
Speaker 1: It's on this tiny little like.

32
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:18,728
Speaker 1: You can't hurt yourself on that thing.

33
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,220
Speaker 1: That's me like the kids are there while the day.

34
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,417
Speaker 0: It's like if you do that on a ski hill you're gonna die.

35
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:27,026
Speaker 0: I like sitting in log cabins going.

36
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,958
Speaker 0: ah and I you know put on my little top hat pretend to be Abraham Lincoln.

37
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:44,900
Speaker 1: nope But this dude was like one of those old-school skiers like he had non-shaped skis But he had like these old like non-shaped skis which like I can't deal with those anymore.

38
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,978
Speaker 1: Like I don't even understand how people can ski on them.

39
00:02:47,804 --> 00:02:50,800
Speaker 1: And he there was this crowd like they had this cool event last night about it.

40
00:02:50,820 --> 00:03:03,698
Speaker 1: They had fireworks on the slopes right after and then today at 4 I left before you know the slopes closed But then they had a rail jam which was basically come and show off in the terrain park on your snowboards.

41
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:14,740
Speaker 1: Oh They have the halfpipe finished and all the awesome stuff, uh-huh yeah But I came home because I didn't want to be there all night especially in the dark in the cold outside.

42
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:19,038
Speaker 1: Well when I was a kid I never got to ski during the day because my parents didn't want to pay the 50 bucks.

43
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:24,460
Speaker 1: So they'd send me at night, and I'd ski from like 5 p.m.. To 10 p.m.. In the dark.

44
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:27,559
Speaker 1: I had a full face mask.

45
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:38,780
Speaker 1: What it's cold, but skiing was a little easier this time since actually People were saying that it was like the nicest day of skiing Hunter Mountain has had in like five years.

46
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:50,470
Speaker 0: It was like it did like it snowed like a bunch, and then it snowed a little bit and then yeah The snow is so powdery that the shovel guys used Leaf blowers instead of shovels.

47
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,425
Speaker 1: cuz I gotta tell you that when I got there You know I got there early.

48
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:59,492
Speaker 1: people don't usually show up to ski into like 10, so it was me like 15 other people in that first half hour.

49
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:01,480
Speaker 1: it was virgin powder.

50
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,589
Speaker 1: There was about three inches of that powder.

51
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,453
Speaker 1: It was beautiful.

52
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:06,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I understand.

53
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:09,420
Speaker 1: I really understand now why people are like all the powder all the powder.

54
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:22,140
Speaker 0: Thing is I watched a video of skiing in Iran and that is it was like a dollar and it was like He's just like mountain with like a crappy old lift and like a shit ton of snow.

55
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:28,040
Speaker 1: Well the cool thing was it sucked because it was a holiday technically so I had to pay the extra couple bucks.

56
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:35,007
Speaker 1: It was like 65 bucks for my lift ticket mmm, but I could about a video game But good about two video games.

57
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:39,700
Speaker 1: it was MLK day like hardly anyone gets it off So there weren't that many people.

58
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,600
Speaker 0: Okay, the thing is the train station was like empty and they ran a weekend schedule and the trains were empty.

59
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,997
Speaker 0: So someone must have had the day off.

60
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:51,219
Speaker 1: yeah Well like a lot of people in urban areas get the day off, but like not everyone does I?

61
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,135
Speaker 1: Met like four different people today who all work in the stock market.

62
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:57,420
Speaker 1: They're like yeah stock holiday here.

63
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, they all drove up from New York like well two of these people.

64
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,200
Speaker 1: they work down the street for me.

65
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:04,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, there you go.

66
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,717
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was cool.

67
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:09,329
Speaker 1: But I Heard the same shoulder that I heard last time.

68
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,533
Speaker 1: I just healed it.

69
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:12,140
Speaker 0: Maybe you should get a soldier surgery.

70
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:14,327
Speaker 0: No, get the baseball shoulder surgery.

71
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,010
Speaker 0: It'll be stronger.

72
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,250
Speaker 0: There's.

73
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:15,672
Speaker 1: no it's.

74
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:20,991
Speaker 1: it's not the same thing, but you know, what's dumb I was doing like the Black Diamonds and I did.

75
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:26,960
Speaker 1: I got in over my head a little bit But I never fell once and all the crazy hard slopes because I was trying real hard.

76
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:28,406
Speaker 1: I was real careful.

77
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:31,480
Speaker 0: Then you went on the bunny hill and you fell over during a lot of these hard slopes.

78
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,277
Speaker 1: I was thinking the whole time don't fall don't fall don't fall.

79
00:05:34,397 --> 00:05:38,920
Speaker 1: Oh shit Once I came around on a it looked like it was an easy one.

80
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:45,530
Speaker 1: It was this Black Diamond, but like goes around this nice gentle like around the corner There's moguls, but I can just kind of avoid the moguls.

81
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:53,215
Speaker 1: and then I come around the corner like around this sharp Like hairpin turn and I turn and it's like straight down and I couldn't stop in time.

82
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:54,720
Speaker 1: So I went straight down.

83
00:05:55,245 --> 00:06:02,303
Speaker 1: I must have been going like 50 miles an hour and then at the end there was a bump and I jumped like six feet in the air and In the air.

84
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:04,594
Speaker 1: my brain thought like like time slowed down.

85
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:13,347
Speaker 1: It was like heartbeat fuck heartbeat fuck Heartbeat, I think I'm gonna make it heartbeat.

86
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,029
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

87
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:15,673
Speaker 1: There's another bump heartbeat.

88
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:16,857
Speaker 1: I'm in the air again.

89
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:22,748
Speaker 1: I totally made it and I thought alright that was that was too much.

90
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:23,752
Speaker 1: That was I risked it.

91
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:24,494
Speaker 1: I made it.

92
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:26,400
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go eat some lunch.

93
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,731
Speaker 1: so I go past the ski lift and I take like the easy bunny trail down and Then I totally fall out of my ass and hurt my shoulder.

94
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:38,427
Speaker 1: I'm like the bunny is bunny trail I told you because I wasn't paying attention.

95
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:45,005
Speaker 1: I was like, oh man, I'm such an awesome ski up BAM No one even saw it.

96
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:48,180
Speaker 1: I was all alone like in this little bunny trail like off by the side.

97
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,597
Speaker 1: There's like the go slow family skiing area there.

98
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:52,240
Speaker 1: It's like man.

99
00:06:52,281 --> 00:07:00,389
Speaker 0: That's something though If you're up on the mountain with not a lot of other people The ski patrol might not notice if you hurt yourself Because someone's gonna patrol will notice.

100
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:06,480
Speaker 1: in fact because they patrol all the slopes like on a regular Basis and they spend a lot of time in the places where people tend to hurt themselves.

101
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,320
Speaker 1: And actually I was riding up with the ski patrol guy.

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,340
Speaker 1: It was funny because the whole time like someone got hurt real bad actually.

103
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:18,636
Speaker 1: But I got to listen to his radio and he was like, yeah I can ignore it until I get to the top because what am I gonna do?

104
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:19,219
Speaker 1: I'm on the lift.

105
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:21,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's the fastest way to the top.

106
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,399
Speaker 0: It was constantly was like should have like an emergency button though that makes the lift go fast.

107
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,554
Speaker 1: like Well, there is one lift that goes real fast.

108
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:35,623
Speaker 1: All the other ones go kind of slow but the whole time it was like Level whatever.

109
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:38,751
Speaker 1: someone reported hurt on this trail on this trail.

110
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,075
Speaker 1: send one guy send two guys.

111
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:42,040
Speaker 1: people got hurt like every two minutes.

112
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:46,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's how it's a dangerous thing shushing on the van.

113
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,780
Speaker 1: But I feel like if I had needed help on that bunny trail.

114
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:54,480
Speaker 1: I don't think they're patrolling that bunny trail because you can't hurt yourself on the bunny trail.

115
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:59,540
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean you could have landed face first in the snow and like just twisted your neck the wrong way by random chance.

116
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,660
Speaker 0: I'm like maybe a hidden rock and then your face would have been in the snow.

117
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,949
Speaker 0: You've been suffocating and bleeding and your teeth falling out.

118
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,956
Speaker 1: There's no hidden rocks on the bunny.

119
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:07,820
Speaker 0: There's a hidden rock.

120
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:08,903
Speaker 1: There's nobody.

121
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:13,035
Speaker 1: I put it there but yeah as a result, you know skiing.

122
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:14,780
Speaker 1: I've only skied a couple times this winter.

123
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:22,600
Speaker 1: I'm 27 now and I feel like that's old and I feel like my body I don't recover as quick like when I was a kid.

124
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,049
Speaker 1: Like I would go skiing like from 5 p.m.

125
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:25,692
Speaker 1: To 10 p.m.

126
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:32,054
Speaker 1: Like I'd fall over like a hundred times Like I would push myself to the limit and be on cartilage first bone.

127
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:33,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, we know about this.

128
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:34,845
Speaker 1: the next day I'd feel great.

129
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:40,288
Speaker 1: In fact when I got home at like midnight, I'd feel great And then I'd stay out playing like the realm or something.

130
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,573
Speaker 1: I don't feel so high right now.

131
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:43,777

146
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,468
Speaker 1: Oh back when he was doing awesome.

147
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,940
Speaker 0: Yeah back when he was doing awesome before he started doing poop, right?

148
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:49,760
Speaker 0: So this interview with this adware guy is like one of the most fascinating Articles that I've read in a long time because this guy is clearly a high quality computer scientist, right?

149
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:58,519
Speaker 0: He talks about like and the way I can tell is because apparently he deployed scheme With the adware and he's pretty sure that's the largest scheme deployment ever.

150
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:17,205
Speaker 0: But he talks about how the adware worked and how they avoided removal and detection and how they were able to remove the other adwares and how Their adware was actually a little bit, you know still shady but a little bit more legitimate than the other adware Which is just blatantly hacking you.

151
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:26,698
Speaker 0: this would basically install when you installed it and uninstall when you uninstalled it It's just when it was installed it, you know kicked your ass and filled you with ads and shit.

152
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,336
Speaker 1: Wow So there's a tiny amount of honor among thieves the funniest.

153
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:37,810
Speaker 0: the funniest thing He talks about actually that I thought was the most interesting was how when he on when you uninstalled Right, which you could only do through their uninstall process.

154
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,460
Speaker 0: No adware removers didn't do the trick, right?

155
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,848
Speaker 0: They would put a registry key in.

156
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:54,880
Speaker 0: they had registry keys while it was installed But when they uninstalled they removed all the registry keys But they put one behind they left one behind and that one was so that their program would never install again.

157
00:10:55,603 --> 00:11:01,819
Speaker 0: You know because if someone you know, so let's say you uninstalled and then you try to install again It would see that registry key and you'd be safe.

158
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:07,819
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, right, but adware removers were stupid and the adware removers would remove that registry key.

159
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:16,000
Speaker 0: Thus if you would uninstall it by the normal means then use an adware remover and then it would install again.

160
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:21,917
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah, I can still only blame the spyware and not the adware removal software.

161
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,774
Speaker 0: Of course, of course But you know, it's weird how the world went from.

162
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:32,060
Speaker 1: adware removal Didn't need to exist - it existed in works - it really just doesn't work anymore.

163
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:42,040
Speaker 0: Like if you really get if you get any virus or any adware or anything You can use a tool to remove it and you might be pretty sure that it's removed.

164
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,840
Speaker 0: You can do a lot of things to look and see if it's removed, you know, you can do some Wireshark.

165
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:50,980
Speaker 0: I guess it's called to look at you know, your network traffic to see if any spyware is going out.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,860
Speaker 1: Yes, Ethereal was renamed to Wireshark due to a - I should tell that story on a Monday show sometime.

167
00:11:56,021 --> 00:12:03,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, but you know, you can do all sorts of things to check if the adware was removed But you can't be a hundred percent sure.

168
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:11,320
Speaker 0: you could be a hundred percent sure you've got it But no matter how many cleaners you run you can never be a hundred percent sure you've gotten rid of it.

169
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,640
Speaker 0: You can be like 90% sure like hey, I ran three adware removal tools and two virus tools.

170
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:18,548
Speaker 0: They don't detect anything.

171
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:20,901
Speaker 0: You can be 90% sure you got rid of it 100%.

172
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:29,816
Speaker 1: the ways to be 100% sure are ways that involve external checking that are also 100% impractical.

173
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:43,587
Speaker 0: Yes so if you get any virus or any malware any adware my recommendation to you is to just erase your entire hard drive and then reinstall your operating system and You should have backups right because they.

174
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:46,956
Speaker 0: installing an operating system like takes 20 minutes.

175
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:48,260
Speaker 0: It takes no time at all.

176
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:49,580
Speaker 0: It's really really easy.

177
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:58,280
Speaker 0: I mean Windows 7 actually like it still is not as easy as Ubuntu because you have to restart a few times But the it was really easy.

178
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:07,375
Speaker 0: It was like they definitely learned from Ubuntu's installer and it's just as good as the Ubuntu installer despite having a couple extra Restarts and take it a little bit longer.

179
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:08,140
Speaker 0: That's the only difference.

180
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,501
Speaker 0: so

181
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:23,134
Speaker 1: people one thing to keep in mind if you've got a Windows box, I've said this before ever everyone smart says this but Install Windows on the C partition and give it enough space and always give it a bunch of extra because it's gonna need more Space and like temp files and things.

182
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:24,000
Speaker 1: you don't want to mess with that.

183
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:25,212
Speaker 1: There are ways around that.

184
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:33,360
Speaker 1: but don't bother Make another partition and put all your other data like your mp3s and crap there.

185
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:42,463
Speaker 1: Yep, that way you can reinstall without losing any of that And as long as nothing on that drive is executables or even if they are Executables.

186
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:46,100
Speaker 1: if they don't get run again, then you can just reinstall the OS and not lose anything.

187
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,770
Speaker 1: But you know all the application stuff you've got to reinstall.

188
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's reinstalling applications is cake.

189
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,675
Speaker 0: I mean, what do you really have to install like Firefox an instant message clients?

190
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:57,020
Speaker 0: Let's say pigeon, right?

191
00:13:57,862 --> 00:14:03,649
Speaker 0: You know some Firefox extensions flash Maybe a bit torrent client right.

192
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,258
Speaker 0: that takes what like 20 minutes?

193
00:14:06,202 --> 00:14:09,969
Speaker 1: Well, you might have some specialized stuff But even then even then you don't install it.

194
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:16,830
Speaker 0: see people make the mistake when they reinstall their OS They sit there for hours and hours reinstalling every single program.

195
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,311
Speaker 0: Don't do that.

196
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:20,660
Speaker 0: Just reinstall the programs as you use them.

197
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,786
Speaker 0: So you're sitting at your computer.

198
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:23,213
Speaker 0: It's a brand new Windows, right?

199
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:27,010
Speaker 0: First thing you got to do I got to go to the web install Firefox.

200
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:29,580
Speaker 0: Oh, man, this ads install adblock.

201
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:32,239
Speaker 0: I got to talk to my friend now install aim.

202
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:38,817
Speaker 1: I want to sync my iPod now install it and automatically make sure that you and it's kind of like.

203
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:46,126
Speaker 1: one of the main reasons reinstalling Windows always makes it fast like people say Vista or you know The new Windows 7 beta are super fast.

204
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:50,700
Speaker 1: take Windows 2000 and install it fresh and it's real fast.

205
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, any windows is real fast - it's a fresh install.

206
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,454
Speaker 0: It just slows down over time.

207
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:57,520
Speaker 1: any NT based window, right?

208
00:14:57,941 --> 00:15:02,778
Speaker 0: I mean Windows 7 if you actually used it for a long time might get slow might?

209
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:05,974
Speaker 0: we don't know I mean, but every other Windows has.

210
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:08,825
Speaker 1: yeah, but It's kind of like.

211
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:11,260
Speaker 1: part of what reinstalling does is you start with the clean slate.

212
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:15,120
Speaker 1: So why not always try to keep your computer as clean slate as possible?

213
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,689
Speaker 0: Oh the one thing you should yeah The one thing you shouldn't wait on is Windows updates.

214
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:21,540
Speaker 0: do every single Windows update immediately all the time.

215
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:23,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much when I install a computer.

216
00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:26,300
Speaker 1: It's all the windows updates and you know.

217
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:36,640
Speaker 1: Well first if they're you know, the motherboard driver if you have a motherboard driver or any of those things Yeah, and then well Windows update now actually takes care of your drivers like it takes care of like from my computer.

218
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:38,846
Speaker 0: It does the real Nvidia driver.

219
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:41,975
Speaker 0: It does like the real network card driver.

220
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:42,577
Speaker 0: It does like.

221
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:43,580
Speaker 0: it takes care of that shit.

222
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,145
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

223
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:47,489
Speaker 1: But yeah, anyway This is a real.

224
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,519
Speaker 1: I actually read this too.

225
00:15:49,081 --> 00:16:08,207
Speaker 0: The computer science parts of the article are just really fascinating like how the like the windows process security flaws and All these, you know file system tricks where he's like using Unicode in the registries that the keys can't be seen and it's While he's doing evil things.

226
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:12,300
Speaker 0: the techniques that he's using are like like really amazing.

227
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:18,784
Speaker 1: It's just really cool to see it from this perspective where it's not like reverse engineering or speculating or you know Figuring out what they did.

228
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:22,478
Speaker 1: It's someone saying this is what we did and why check it out.

229
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:31,372
Speaker 1: Yep but in other news this I don't want to talk about this in super depth because the issues that would be brought up are many.

230
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:45,970
Speaker 1: I mean we could do a whole show about this, but There is a a problem that Barack Obama is Running into whereby due to the way our government works and the way technology is and the way politics are He has a blackberry.

231
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,680
Speaker 1: he's a hip tech guy like he's.

232
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:58,000
Speaker 0: Yes, people I mean he's probably not a computer science genius, but I think he has some Smart tech people working for him and he knows enough.

233
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,481
Speaker 0: He's not.

234
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:10,579
Speaker 0: he doesn't know as much as us but he knows more than any president ever and possibly and significantly more than most other Federal elected officials, he knows more than most of the congressman and he knows a lot.

235
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,150
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I would call him computer literate.

236
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:13,732
Speaker 0: Definitely.

237
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:15,780
Speaker 1: In fact, he's probably above average in that regard.

238
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,446
Speaker 0: But yeah, he can rock the face.

239
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:18,570
Speaker 0: He can make a podcast.

240
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:20,900
Speaker 0: He can rock a Facebook and he can send a blackberry.

241
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,638
Speaker 0: That's more than George Bush with his AOL's.

242
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:25,983
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

243
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:34,013
Speaker 1: He uses a blackberry and the Secret Service and the government and everyone are basically saying Barack You can't keep using the blackberry.

244
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:40,759
Speaker 1: for all these reasons Security is a concern and data retention is a concern and privacy is a concern.

245
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:47,540
Speaker 1: and He got a bunch of lawyers together and he was trying to fight to say look how can we get around this?

246
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,967
Speaker 1: I really want my blackberry.

247
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,160
Speaker 0: I like to see the thing was he got a bunch of lawyers.

248
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,987
Speaker 0: He should have gotten a bunch of computer scientists.

249
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:54,633
Speaker 0: They would have figured it out.

250
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:56,560
Speaker 1: No, it's not a matter of figuring it out.

251
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,950
Speaker 1: It's not a matter of having a technological solution.

252
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,215
Speaker 1: This is the root problem here.

253
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:04,540
Speaker 1: No Technological solution is even on the table.

254
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:16,592
Speaker 1: The problem is the politics and the bureaucracy and the fact that our government is a government of Luddites, I mean Congress is so technologically archaic.

255
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:17,997
Speaker 1: It's not laughable.

256
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:22,431
Speaker 1: It's frightening and What bothers me and this just kind of brings it all to light.

257
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:22,713
Speaker 1: is that?

258
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:24,240
Speaker 1: why isn't there?

259
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,040
Speaker 1: Why do people need to use a blackberry if you're the president or you're in Congress?

260
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:42,800
Speaker 1: Shouldn't there be a blackberry equivalent that is just for people in the federal government in that is Encrypted and controlled by the government and everything's archived and you know keeps it forever super secure?

261
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:49,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean every even the crappiest offices in you know, like just just normal offices have exchange servers, right?

262
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,892
Speaker 0: Why doesn't Congress at least have an exchange server?

263
00:18:53,193 --> 00:18:53,796
Speaker 1: But what no?

264
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:54,680
Speaker 1: go one step further?

265
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,340
Speaker 1: Why don't they at least at least I'm talking about portable.

266
00:18:57,821 --> 00:19:09,475
Speaker 1: Imagine if and this wouldn't even cost that much to do the government designed or hired people to design a Blackberry like device that was only to be used by high government officials.

267
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:10,860
Speaker 0: You wouldn't even need a different device.

268
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:16,206
Speaker 1: No, no make up make a new device, you know that way it meets all though There's a lot of weird standards and things.

269
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:24,695
Speaker 1: you just put different software on an existing device you could but then they always worry about Who makes the devices and they could be compromised at the hardware firmware level.

270
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:25,619
Speaker 0: and oh, it's BS.

271
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,549
Speaker 1: No stuff like that has happened before.

272
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,635
Speaker 0: let's get the palm free.

273
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:29,460
Speaker 0: No one knows about it.

274
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:36,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, the idea is what if every member of Congress had a special blackberry like device that was super RSA style.

275
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,455
Speaker 1: Whatever encryption, you know three-factor authentication, you know thumbprint pin.

276
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:43,000
Speaker 0: No Congress people would know how to use it.

277
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,259
Speaker 0: It'd be like that doctor who threw his printer in the garbage.

278
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:51,859
Speaker 1: Well, you force them to use it and you make it anyway Even if they don't use it eventually they'll all die and there will be people who will use it.

279
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think of this.

280
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:54,591
Speaker 0: by then though.

281
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,717
Speaker 0: We won't have that anymore.

282
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,460
Speaker 0: We'll have something better.

283
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,282
Speaker 0: So it would have been a waste?

284
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:08,814
Speaker 1: no wouldn't because then that member Congress will still be a whole technological generation behind and having this Even in a primitive form in the future is better than what they'll have.

285
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,878
Speaker 1: Otherwise in the future.

286
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:19,720
Speaker 1: Yeah But I mean imagine if right now if Congress is out of session and there's an emergency What the president can do something but it's gonna take a while to get Congress together.

287
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,336
Speaker 1: What if they all got paged on a little blackberry?

288
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:28,898
Speaker 1: they open it They can read these super secret important thing and then they can like vote on the emergency thing right then and there

289
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,038
Speaker 0: because we wouldn't be on c-span

290
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:38,816
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter it's archived and then have the semi live redacted RSS and Twitter feed of what's going on in Congress.

291
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:48,733
Speaker 1: Yeah Just this the fact that this is an issue Opens up a whole bunch of problems that are just.

292
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:53,719
Speaker 1: our government does not use technology efficiently and if it did we could solve all of these problems trivially.

293
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:58,957
Speaker 1: and I don't want to talk about this news anymore because I really think we just need to have a computer.

294
00:20:59,017 --> 00:20:59,680
Speaker 0: be the government.

295
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:11,072
Speaker 0: You know like in every bad sci-fi where eventually the computer decides to kill everyone like paranoia or you know, Phoenix future It'll take it a while before it tries to kill everyone.

296
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:11,534
Speaker 1: Yeah.

297
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:11,915
Speaker 0: Yeah.

298
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:12,960
Speaker 0: So in the meantime, it's great.

299
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,120
Speaker 0: I mean, how do you think those places end up like that?

300
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,547
Speaker 0: You know, how do you end up in Logan's run?

301
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:21,350
Speaker 0: because the computer is great for a long time So everyone loves it and then eventually it turns evil.

302
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:23,660
Speaker 1: Are you are you implying that the computer is evil?

303
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,607
Speaker 1: Do you not trust the computer?

304
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:27,213
Speaker 1: Are you not a happy citizen?

305
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,782
Speaker 0: No, because by the time the computer turns evil I'll be dead.

306
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,047
Speaker 0: So it's all good.

307
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:33,294
Speaker 1: But implying that the computer could turn evil.

308
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:35,020
Speaker 1: Are you a communist?

309
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:43,306
Speaker 1: No I Deny the fact that they're communist.

310
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:43,908
Speaker 0: Well, I like.

311
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,753
Speaker 0: I like free market computing.

312
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:47,820
Speaker 0: you like equal opportunity computing.

313
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:59,480
Speaker 1: But yeah I want to do a show about this sometime in the future because I have like six points That each of which will take me a while to get out related to this article.

314
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,140
Speaker 1: But suffice to say read this article and read all the concerns that they have pointed out.

315
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:33,700
Speaker 1: I mean, there are a lot of concerns rain and the one that bothers me is they're worried that If the president uses something like a blackberry then everything he does personal would be recorded somewhere and then later Maybe that could all be dug up in case he was doing shady stuff to which I say good Transparency, I feel like if you're a government official There should be a certain expectation that you give up a lot of your privacy as long as you are Something like a president or a member of Congress.

316
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:39,360
Speaker 1: Like I feel like one of the prices of doing the job is think about a lot of your rights while you're doing the job.

317
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,767
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean think about this right?

318
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:43,060
Speaker 0: I work for my boss, right?

319
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,053
Speaker 0: Well while I work for you know, my boss my boss can look at my work email.

320
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:50,200
Speaker 0: All right, and whatever right?

321
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,585
Speaker 0: now if You're the president Everyone is your boss.

322
00:22:57,067 --> 00:23:00,740
Speaker 0: So everyone should be able to see your work email.

323
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:01,765
Speaker 0: Now you do have.

324
00:23:02,106 --> 00:23:05,020
Speaker 0: there are no email for example outside of work.

325
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:16,640
Speaker 1: There are other exceptions to for example the email that you send saying effectively So the agents that are stationed in X are doing Y for Z right now, correct?

326
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,993
Speaker 1: We got to hold off on that until that situation is resolved.

327
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:21,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm okay with that.

328
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,312
Speaker 0: You don't need to show it to everyone.

329
00:23:23,412 --> 00:23:25,784
Speaker 0: You just need to Put it somewhere.

330
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:29,558
Speaker 1: Yes on a hard drive and then wait until you know, it doesn't matter anymore.

331
00:23:29,598 --> 00:23:30,240
Speaker 1: then reveal it all.

332
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:35,114
Speaker 0: Our government in general is just terrible about waiting and then showing.

333
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:36,438
Speaker 0: it's like they just wait forever.

334
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:37,080
Speaker 0: They never show.

335
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:38,465
Speaker 0: There's like World War one shit.

336
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:39,028
Speaker 0: They haven't shown.

337
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:40,614
Speaker 0: it's like what the fuck guys is.

338
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:41,940
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter anymore.

339
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,485
Speaker 0: Yes cough it the fuck up.

340
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,311
Speaker 0: It's of historical significance.

341
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,375
Speaker 1: what so we betrayed?

342
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:48,000
Speaker 0: it's not historically significant.

343
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,344
Speaker 0: What's your reason to hide it?

344
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,471
Speaker 1: So we betrayed the Prussians.

345
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:54,400
Speaker 1: so under whoopty freakin do there's no more Prussia.

346
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:57,512
Speaker 0: Yeah, what are they gonna do about it once something's old?

347
00:23:57,573 --> 00:23:58,818
Speaker 0: I don't care how secret it is.

348
00:23:58,878 --> 00:23:59,340
Speaker 0: cough it up.

349
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:03,780
Speaker 1: But anyway read the articles and sometime in the future we're gonna talk about this in more depth.

350
00:24:10,206 --> 00:24:12,020
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

351
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:14,960
Speaker 1: We'll see how long we go in this episode since we're both kind of fading fast.

352
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,531
Speaker 0: Well speaking of government not doing so well with technology FCC.

353
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:24,206
Speaker 1: Ah the FCC You should be disbanded and remade.

354
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:26,211
Speaker 0: Yeah, did I use this already?

355
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:26,773
Speaker 0: Oh crap.

356
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:28,016
Speaker 1: Ah, good job.

357
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:28,698
Speaker 0: Let me go check.

358
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:29,600
Speaker 0: good game.

359
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,167
Speaker 1: Alright, I'll talk about mine.

360
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:32,935
Speaker 1: So this is just a picture.

361
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:33,860
Speaker 1: That's all it is.

362
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:37,411
Speaker 1: It's I'm pretty sure it's World War one vintage.

363
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:40,440
Speaker 1: I'd imagine it's in Britain.

364
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:41,605
Speaker 1: Just this.

365
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:45,020
Speaker 1: I'm guessing that it's in Britain, but it could theoretically be somewhere else.

366
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:58,980
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go with Britain and it's a whole bunch of kids and a few soldiers and things all wearing gas masks Doing a parade and they've got a little like machine gun and a bunch of flags and a little armored car.

367
00:24:59,822 --> 00:25:00,849
Speaker 0: I'm not an armored car.

368
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,340
Speaker 1: I'm not really sure of the context.

369
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:04,480
Speaker 1: I'm not really sure what's going on.

370
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:11,519
Speaker 1: If this is a demonstration a photo op a drill what but it is one of the creepiest pictures I've ever seen.

371
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:23,394
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm World War one gas masks are one of the few things that creep me out just a little bit Like it's very scary like it may if I woke up, you know Just like I woke up in the morning and I saw a World War one gas mask.

372
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:26,511
Speaker 1: I might yell At least a little.

373
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:31,535
Speaker 0: I should get one Hanging on the ceiling in your room or wear it in the morning.

374
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:32,279
Speaker 0: wake you up.

375
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:33,118
Speaker 1: Well, it's like that.

376
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:47,279
Speaker 1: We had a friend at RIT was afraid of clowns and we always had this sinister idea of getting a little chip with a speaker That would play very quietly And just leave it somewhere in his bedroom to activate like a week later.

377
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:53,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's very much like truck one of those things that's funny, but you never actually do it because it doesn't actually work.

378
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:54,225
Speaker 0: It could work.

379
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,359
Speaker 1: I've never seen truck work.

380
00:25:56,641 --> 00:25:59,838
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the FCC if I did this already, fuck you.

381
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:00,220
Speaker 0: I'm tired.

382
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:12,319
Speaker 0: Basically we complain about the FCC now because of stupid shit like, you know Censorship of radio and broadcast television, which is I say not their area.

383
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,159
Speaker 0: But they should not be dealing with that.

384
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,547
Speaker 0: All right, they should only be concerned with.

385
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:31,395
Speaker 0: you know, two people on the same frequency fucking each other up, you know They also have a lot of other problems, you know allowing cable television cartels Not doing net neutrality and making you know, ISPs utility.

386
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:33,000
Speaker 0: Oh, they're they're not so great.

387
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:52,860
Speaker 0: Right a lot of problems, but apparently most of these problems we see in the context of you know, the now apparently way back in 1974 as Former FCC general counsel Henry Geller did a paper called a modest proposal to reform the Federal Communications Commission.

388
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,675
Speaker 0: So this shit has been fucked up for a long time like before cassette tapes.

389
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:59,360
Speaker 0: a long time, right?

390
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,873
Speaker 0: 1974 man, that's ancient.

391
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:04,065
Speaker 0: It's like Disco.

392
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:10,800
Speaker 0: and he was saying man FCC's fucked up when all they had was radio Speaking of which though disco needs to come back in a big way anyway.

393
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:18,859
Speaker 0: Well, the FCC can take care of that cuz they'll just regulate the radio and say no music except this But all this music can be yours.

394
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:27,033
Speaker 0: Anyway, only disco No, so there's this website called FCC dash reform org.

395
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:45,350
Speaker 0: that has this paper from 1974 which is just revealed as well as a lot of other videos and papers by prominent people of you know former FCC people intellectuals professors lawyers all kinds of people and they all say Basically FCC's corrupt got to fix it.

396
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:46,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's wrong?

397
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:47,619
Speaker 0: Come on, let's go.

398
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:55,305
Speaker 0: So you know if you ever want to argue with someone or you know or want to have a discussion about the FCC and why it Needs to be reformed.

399
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:57,980
Speaker 1: point out that in our world have a discussion means argue.

400
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:05,637
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you if you will thinking about writing a letter to like the FCC or your congressman to talk about reforming the FCC Cuz you know, there's a new Congress right now.

401
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:07,228
Speaker 0: Go to this site.

402
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:07,932
Speaker 0: Do your research.

403
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:08,536
Speaker 0: write a little letter.

404
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:14,879
Speaker 0: You're all good All right All right, so I'm pretty sure we didn't do a show on this already.

405
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:21,800
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk that long about it either because we're fading fast But we'll probably do another show along similar lines in the future.

406
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,294
Speaker 1: But got to talk a little bit about the OC the OC the overclock.

407
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:37,586
Speaker 1: You see I could make a graph of it's a graph that shows usefulness on one on the X Y axis and Year on the X axis.

408
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:47,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, see a lot of people out there, you know, they like computer hardware They like buying parts on Newegg putting a computer together, right and they like to overclock.

409
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,785
Speaker 0: They overclock the video card.

410
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:49,709
Speaker 0: They overclock the CPU.

411
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:52,560
Speaker 0: They do a little RAM clock, right?

412
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:59,720
Speaker 0: You know and I did that back in the day and I understand, you know how it could be sort of interesting and maybe fun.

413
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:22,419
Speaker 0: But from a practical perspective if you are in the current day 2009 if you want to build a personal computer on the x86 platform All right, pretty much any plan actually any common personal computer architecture And you want to actually use that computer for a long time and get your money's worth.

414
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,040
Speaker 0: Overclocking is really stupid.

415
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:31,138
Speaker 1: Now before anyone gets, you know, I'll get their pennies in a wad or any of that.

416
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:34,474
Speaker 1: just Hobbyist overclocking is cool.

417
00:29:34,494 --> 00:29:35,018
Speaker 1: Like any other.

418
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:43,540
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean when you see like, you know new egg guys doing a Demonstration where they get like the liquid nitrogen out and they get the CPU up to like eight gigahertz.

419
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,005
Speaker 0: So some crazy shit going on.

420
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:49,640
Speaker 0: That's cool, but they never intended that computer to actually be used.

421
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:58,940
Speaker 0: They just did it for you know, the demonstration purposes, you know That wasn't a computer that you saved up fifteen hundred dollars for and bought and now plan to play games on for five years.

422
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:05,040
Speaker 0: All right, that was a computer for a cool demonstration in which case overclocking is a pretty neat demonstration.

423
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:09,813
Speaker 1: Now the reason overclocking isn't really why it's not useful anymore.

424
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,300
Speaker 1: Is that one for most purposes?

425
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:25,191
Speaker 1: Computers are a lot faster than you need them to be and for gaming It's so cheap to upgrade like the time it takes to overclock and set up the cooling and then the risk Versus buying a new component like a good example is.

426
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:28,120
Speaker 1: I did try overclocking my video card my current video card.

427
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:30,709
Speaker 1: I have a g4 7900 whatever.

428
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,900
Speaker 1: No, and it's it's not really fast enough.

429
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:47,117
Speaker 1: like if I play left for dead every now and then my frame rate will drop and And like fallout 3 the frame rate drops in like four different places where it really gets to me Like four parts of the game like in the tree plays like I can't walk around in there.

430
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:47,920
Speaker 1: It's really bad.

431
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,593
Speaker 1: You can turn the settings down, you know, yeah, but I didn't really want to do that.

432
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:53,580
Speaker 0: So that's what they're there for.

433
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,786
Speaker 1: So for on a lark I use the utility and I overclock my video card and I got about 10 more frames a second.

434
00:31:00,388 --> 00:31:07,759
Speaker 1: and then I looked online and I can buy a video card that will get me Way more than 10 more frames a second for like 80 bucks.

435
00:31:08,271 --> 00:31:14,880
Speaker 1: Yep See like back in the day and while it was overclocked my case overheated an hour later.

436
00:31:15,201 --> 00:31:20,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, while right back in the day like a quality video card was $300.

437
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:22,729
Speaker 0: But right now you can go and buy an Nvidia 9800 GT for like 120 bucks.

438
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:24,293
Speaker 0: That's pretty much.

439
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:36,440
Speaker 0: I have an 8800 GT with my 8800 GT and my middle-of-the-road core to duo I think three gigahertz core to duo no overclocking whatsoever.

440
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,089
Speaker 0: Completely standard retail cooling equipment, right?

441
00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:44,100
Speaker 0: I can play the crisis demo the infamous crisis.

442
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:53,187
Speaker 0: I played the demo with everything turned all the way up at 1680 by 1050 at Vertical sync with no drop-offs.

443
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:58,226
Speaker 0: if I would have had a 9800 GT instead of the 8800 GT It would only be better than that.

444
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:02,902
Speaker 0: And this is also on the infamous Vista, which is less performance Right.

445
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:07,459
Speaker 0: So why would I overclock if I can get you know max?

446
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,372
Speaker 0: Basically performance in what I'm gonna do with Standard equipment in this case.

447
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:20,798
Speaker 1: There is one Situation where overclocking might be somewhat useful But then again, it's a calculated risk and you really got to think about it.

448
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:31,094
Speaker 1: Say you're in late high school or early college and you all your gamer Gaming PC's a little old and you're real poor like right now for us.

449
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:32,940
Speaker 1: We have plenty of money in no time.

450
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,440
Speaker 1: So overclocking is completely dumb because for the time it takes to overclock I could make enough money in my job.

451
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,166
Speaker 1: You just buy all the components.

452
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,935
Speaker 0: and I mean if I bought nothing but computers.

453
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,210
Speaker 0: Oh My god, I could buy like five computers a month.

454
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:49,860
Speaker 1: and I remember like one thing I did at RIT a couple times.

455
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,680
Speaker 1: I just sat down and thought and they would all be the god of God.

456
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:55,967
Speaker 1: I thought if money were no object What kind of computer would I build?

457
00:32:55,987 --> 00:33:00,820
Speaker 1: I would build like an $8,000 computer online and just look at it nowadays.

458
00:33:02,128 --> 00:33:05,067
Speaker 1: even then $4,000 is a supercomputer.

459
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:10,785
Speaker 0: I bought an $800 desktop and I bought it about a $2,000 laptop But it's not $2,000 anymore.

460
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:14,297
Speaker 1: My current computer is $1,200 including the widescreen.

461
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:15,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that's tough.

462
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:23,513
Speaker 0: Yeah If I'm not counting my monitor or my speakers or any of my other equipment that I brought over from the past plus I went Real high-end on this computer when I bought it.

463
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:27,573
Speaker 1: so not on the video card though No, but at the time this computer is real old.

464
00:33:27,694 --> 00:33:29,803
Speaker 1: actually now, it's over a year old You should just buy the 9800 GT.

465
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,549
Speaker 0: I was talking about I'm going to.

466
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,600
Speaker 1: actually I bought this computer the one I'm using now.

467
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:40,253
Speaker 1: That's still stupidly fast When I still work to that hospital, it's been way over a year.

468
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:42,000
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and it's doing fine.

469
00:33:42,060 --> 00:34:02,339
Speaker 1: but yet if you if you have a lot more money than time and You're willing to either spend the time to research and make sure that your cooling is set up, right and you're willing to risk possibly having to reinstall windows after you screw it up and You are willing to risk the fact that you may screw up your hardware

470
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:04,928
Speaker 0: And have to buy a new computer then.

471
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:14,947
Speaker 1: Yeah overclocking isn't that bad of an idea But really only if you have more money than time or you're a hobbyist and you're doing it for the sake of doing it As opposed to for a practical reason, I

472
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:25,960
Speaker 0: guess there's also the case right where let's say you're poor right and but you have a computer, but it's not fast enough and You're willing to lose the computer, right?

473
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,485
Speaker 0: So it's an old computer.

474
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:33,620
Speaker 0: you can overclock that beast and maybe try to make it more useful than it currently is.

475
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,280
Speaker 0: You know, it's already old, you know.

476
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,570
Speaker 0: But I guess you just have to be willing to recognize.

477
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:47,179
Speaker 1: you might break it and have to buy a new one like old Athlon Like, you know the k7s the 800 megahertz the the durons and all those you can overclock the hell out of them.

478
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,783
Speaker 0: I'll see that's the.

479
00:34:47,803 --> 00:34:51,300
Speaker 0: that's the thing right back in our day in the earlier part of the decade.

480
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:54,940
Speaker 0: Right the Athlon era the Pentium 4 era, right?

481
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,587
Speaker 0: It was like getting a chip.

482
00:34:57,627 --> 00:35:00,840
Speaker 0: That was one step faster was a lot of money.

483
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:03,411
Speaker 0: Oh, and it wasn't just because we were poor in those days.

484
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:04,917
Speaker 0: It actually was a lot more money.

485
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:19,180
Speaker 0: So Overclocking, you know, if you looked at the price and performance and the risk of things and then that time in history Overclocking was a great idea because more likely than not it was gonna work, right?

486
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:31,440
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean think you're gonna get a huge performance increase in a time where software was a lot more demanding than Hardware could put up and you could hope like there were avenues of overclocking that don't matter as much now like back then.

487
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:37,118
Speaker 1: There were like the front side bus was like the biggest bottleneck in the world.

488
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,947
Speaker 1: now It's not as much of a yeah.

489
00:35:38,987 --> 00:35:42,503
Speaker 0: now with DDR like DDR3 It's not really a problem.

490
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:51,491
Speaker 0: so much the RAM speed, you know, but now with PCI x16 and you know instead of oh You know AGP 2x that's not really a problem either.

491
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:51,932
Speaker 1: Yep.

492
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:52,595
Speaker 1: Plus.

493
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:56,830
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember very specifically I had an Athlon 800 megahertz.

494
00:35:57,452 --> 00:36:03,210
Speaker 1: the Athlon like gigahertz Was more than twice as much money at the time.

495
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:11,934
Speaker 1: so I could buy two of the chip I got and Wreck one of them and still be still and I could overclock it to be faster than the chip I didn't buy because it was too expensive.

496
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:12,984
Speaker 1: Yep So I did.

497
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:15,603
Speaker 1: I overclocked my 800 to about 933.

498
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:27,954
Speaker 0: but nowadays unless you're doing like Pixar type work or running Maya or something crazy or deck of like a giant painting in Photoshop or something like You like to play the benchmark game though only if you're playing it as a game.

499
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:29,700
Speaker 1: benchmarks are basically useless.

500
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless you're doing something like that, right like a core 2 duo is gonna do everything you need hardware.

501
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:38,387
Speaker 0: these days It's way ahead of the software.

502
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:45,754
Speaker 0: That's why we're seeing this netbook surgeons because 90% of what people do can be accomplished with really low horsepower.

503
00:36:45,814 --> 00:36:52,473
Speaker 0: So getting more horsepower Especially at the risk of having to spend more money is really bad idea.

504
00:36:52,513 --> 00:37:02,318
Speaker 0: when you don't need the extra horsepower is suddenly Applications started getting more demanding again and suddenly, you know The chips weren't fast enough to do everyday things like they.

505
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:07,460
Speaker 0: you know They weren't fast enough in the olden days right where you'd get skipping just like watching a video or something.

506
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:12,915
Speaker 0: Then maybe overclock would become a good idea again, but it's not so it's not.

507
00:37:13,256 --> 00:37:13,577
Speaker 1: of course.

508
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:18,180
Speaker 1: remember to I Like I did the crazy air cooling and like I set my case up awesome.

509
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,149
Speaker 1: It sounded like a jet engine and I overclocked my AMD quite a bit.

510
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:32,273
Speaker 1: I also overclocked my video card quite a bit and that computer crash About twice a week when it was overclocked and it didn't.

511
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:44,085
Speaker 1: when it wasn't overclocked it also My windows installation due to these crashes would become corrupt to the point that I would have to reinstall About once every four months.

512
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:47,072
Speaker 1: Yep, and it was clearly due to the overclocking.

513
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:57,649
Speaker 1: and in fact the overclocking and the heat Accelerated the death of my motherboard when eventually the capacitors exploded due to the Unrelated Chinese bootleg problem back in the day.

514
00:37:57,669 --> 00:38:05,680
Speaker 0: Yeah nowadays if you get a motherboard with the solid-state capacitors That specific problem will be less but the unreliability is still a major issue.

515
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:09,614
Speaker 0: the other thing you got to worry about when the overclocking is the cooling.

516
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:14,173
Speaker 0: the cooling is big because You know when you overclock something it's gonna make more heat.

517
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:15,900
Speaker 0: That's the reality of physics, right?

518
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:18,748
Speaker 0: So you want to make sure you have more cooling.

519
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:22,720
Speaker 0: if you overclock that way, you know, you got that extra safety there.

520
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,683
Speaker 0: Maybe it'll even be a hundred percent reliable.

521
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:25,605
Speaker 0: Maybe right.

522
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:31,367
Speaker 0: The thing is if you buy say a Quad-core right it comes.

523
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:33,676
Speaker 0: if you buy a retail one it comes with this heatsink.

524
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:37,256
Speaker 0: that heatsink It comes with that has the Intel sticker on it.

525
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:37,920
Speaker 0: It's the Intel.

526
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,342
Speaker 0: I guess it's.

527
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:40,954
Speaker 0: I don't know if Intel makes those things but it's Intel brand.

528
00:38:40,974 --> 00:38:46,500
Speaker 0: heatsink is Super-quiet and can cool the chip perfectly if you don't overclock.

529
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:50,579
Speaker 0: So there's no reason to use anything else unless you overclock.

530
00:38:51,581 --> 00:39:02,280
Speaker 0: Anything else is gonna be bigger and louder Unless you get water cooling in which case it will be quieter But it'll be a pain in the ass.

531
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,936
Speaker 0: You're gonna risk getting water everywhere if you don't know what you're doing and it's gonna be real expensive.

532
00:39:07,437 --> 00:39:19,680
Speaker 0: and you know Even with water cooling right water cooling might, you know be quieter and cooler But you have used more electricity on the stupid condenser thingy that cools the water.

533
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:32,400
Speaker 1: Well, the main reason I ever had for water cooling when I really thought about doing I ended up not doing it Was that I wanted a computer that was quiet so I could use it as a media PC, but now a Mac Mini is silent

534
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:41,394
Speaker 0: yeah, but even so if you have a computer in your room in the same room that you sleep in or even a different room than You sleep in it's still really like people don't you know?

535
00:39:41,434 --> 00:39:46,138
Speaker 0: know until they have a quiet computer It's real nice to have a computer that doesn't make a lot of noise.

536
00:39:46,198 --> 00:40:08,020
Speaker 0: I mean If you start like when I start playing a game, you know like when I play Fallout 3 the video card fans start going faster and faster and faster and they start to make a little bit of noise and it is Bothers them because like I hear them and they sort of interfere with the game I'm playing where I want to hear what's in the game, you know, so a quieter computer is always better.

537
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:13,620
Speaker 0: Oh, unless it's like a server rack kind of computer in which case, you know, it could be fucking loud as you want.

538
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:17,235
Speaker 0: Oh my god, every rack about computer is loud as all work.

539
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:18,400
Speaker 1: They were setting up some switches.

540
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,840
Speaker 0: They're like new Cisco things and you turn them on and they're just so fucking loud.

541
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,622
Speaker 1: Well when you turn them on at first because they have variable fan speed depending on the environment So they'll.

542
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:31,636
Speaker 0: they'll when they have variable span fan speed between jet engine and Concorde.

543
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:32,900
Speaker 1: No, they're actually pretty quiet.

544
00:40:33,462 --> 00:40:38,200
Speaker 1: But when you turn them on before you can figure them they default to the fastest.

545
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:44,239
Speaker 1: So literally I hear this jet engine take off and everyone the whole office is looking like what the fuck is that?

546
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, my computer when you turn it on like for a few seconds It goes full speed but then it comes back down.

547
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:54,778
Speaker 0: once the BIOS gets going, you know back to normal manage speed.

548
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:56,949
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, I'll see.

549
00:40:56,969 --> 00:41:02,720
Speaker 0: you gotta remember, you know your power supply Your video card and your CPU fan are the sources of most of the noise.

550
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:06,279
Speaker 0: So you really want to get quiet power supply quiet video card?

551
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:18,797
Speaker 0: standard retail comes with the chip CPU fan for the maximum quietness and if Overclocking gets you like five frames a second, but as a result, everything's louder or more expensive.

552
00:41:19,178 --> 00:41:20,020
Speaker 0: Was it really worth it?

553
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:29,191
Speaker 0: I mean you could pay $50 for you know a water cooling kit or you could pay $50 For one chip faster than what you got.

554
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:30,094
Speaker 0: so what?

555
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:31,700
Speaker 0: why did you buy the water cool?

556
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,999
Speaker 0: Okay, you could have just gotten a faster chip in the first place.

557
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:40,139
