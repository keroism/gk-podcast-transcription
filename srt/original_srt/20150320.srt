1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,478
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, March 19th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:10,799
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:13,649
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,029
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, our review of San Antonio, Texas.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,590
Speaker 1: The geographical, political place.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,408
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,220
Speaker 0: Of course, once again, no shows next week because I'm going to London, like, Monday.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,180
Speaker 1: Why don't you just move there?

9
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:34,870
Speaker 0: Actually, you know what?

10
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:35,800
Speaker 0: I can live in London.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:45,620
Speaker 0: London is alongside New York City as the only two, like, global alpha cities in the world by that whatever, like, academic group that studies cities.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,059
Speaker 1: Isn't there way less freedom there?

13
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:50,800
Speaker 0: Arguably, it's pretty similar to what we have here.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,697
Speaker 0: I mean, the real difference is...

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,189
Speaker 1: I mean, there's no freedom of speech.

16
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:54,900
Speaker 1: There's not even Miranda rights.

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,847
Speaker 0: Well, here's the problem.

18
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,076
Speaker 0: Practically, yes.

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,940
Speaker 0: Well, practically, they're very similar, but, like, ideologically and law-wise, they're very different.

20
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:09,100
Speaker 0: The only things that practically affect, like, you and me if we were living there is the fact that truth is not defense against libel, meaning we would be fucked.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,369
Speaker 1: Really?

22
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:18,757
Speaker 1: If I'm in the UK and I say, "Rim eats poops," and I have a video of Rim eating poops, and I publish that in the newspaper...

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,220
Speaker 0: Yes, I could go after you for defamation of character by distributing that true information if I did it with intent to harm.

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,460
Speaker 0: You did it with intent to harm.

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,480
Speaker 1: My intent was to make fun of Rim because he eats poops and to let everyone know so that no one goes near him because he's dangerous with his poop eating.

26
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,503
Speaker 0: This is why there is a... But it's true.

27
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,280
Speaker 1: Here's a video that's unaltered of him literally eating poops.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:54,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, so truth is not defense for that in the UK, which is why many, many, many people around the world will never go there because they have lost a case that they never went to testify in and don't want to deal with because someone else engaged in libel tourism.

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,885
Speaker 1: Let me ask a question.

30
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:58,620
Speaker 1: In the UK, do they have warning signs on dangerous things?

31
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, the pit cannot say... Here's the other problem, Scott.

32
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:11,980
Speaker 0: Because it's like British-English common law shit, the judges could just be like, "Yeah, that's stupid," in a way that we can't hear, the argument you were about to make.

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,299
Speaker 1: Good reason not to go there.

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:23,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time, imagine there's a lot of cases where our judges should be able to say, "That is stupid," but instead they don't because they can't because we have a constitutional system.

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,044
Speaker 0: It goes both ways.

36
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:34,400
Speaker 1: In our courtrooms with their big, tall, magistrate, scary things on the side with really hot tie-up.

37
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:37,559
Speaker 1: You always see them in the historical-type movies.

38
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:42,059
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure they're not actually like that anymore, but maybe they are.

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:43,959
Speaker 0: Sophie!

40
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, that kind.

41
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,282
Speaker 1: Yeah.

42
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:48,147
Speaker 0: Oh, my gosh.

43
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:49,892
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's Thursday.

44
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:52,780
Speaker 0: You got any news for the Geek Nights Lounge?

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,640
Speaker 1: There's not really any news, and it's not a lounge.

46
00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:56,739
Speaker 0: There's a lot of news.

47
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:58,340
Speaker 1: So, I had to steal Monday's news.

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,879
Speaker 0: All sorts of shit's going down.

49
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,808
Speaker 1: Not really, no.

50
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:01,840
Speaker 1: There's nothing going down.

51
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,383
Speaker 1: So, Monday's news.

52
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:08,820
Speaker 1: Windows 10, which is coming, which is looking to be the next legit Windows.

53
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,140
Speaker 1: I mean, even if Windows 7 is still just fine, which it is, you're probably going to need to bail on it at some point.

54
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:19,760
Speaker 1: Windows XP is just fine, but you kind of need to bail on it at some point.

55
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,869
Speaker 0: It's not just fine.

56
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:21,920
Speaker 0: A lot of shit doesn't work on it.

57
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,083
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

58
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:25,129
Speaker 1: It's still perfect.

59
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:29,240
Speaker 1: There's nothing quality wrong with it, other than the fact that they stopped maintaining it, and now it's too old.

60
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:30,281
Speaker 1: Right?

61
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:31,590
Speaker 1: Just like Windows 2000 is great.

62
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:33,200
Speaker 1: You can't use it anymore.

63
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,812
Speaker 0: It's got performance and memory.

64
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:35,920
Speaker 0: It's not... anyway.

65
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,970
Speaker 1: But Windows 7 is nearing that too old point.

66
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:40,677
Speaker 1: It's still usable today.

67
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:41,480
Speaker 1: I still use it today.

68
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,538
Speaker 1: But it's getting to be too old sometime soon.

69
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:44,980
Speaker 0: Well, I've moved to a point in my life...

70
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,912
Speaker 1: So, like it or not, you're going to have to go to Windows 10.

71
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:48,420
Speaker 1: You're not going to want to go to 8.

72
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,080
Speaker 0: You know, in the old days...

73
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,093
Speaker 1: Not that there's that much wrong with 8 either, just as a bad rep.

74
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:53,560
Speaker 0: The same way Vista had a bad rep.

75
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,264
Speaker 0: I went and bought Windows 2000.

76
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,940
Speaker 0: I would upgrade my operating system, and in the modern era, I only upgrade my operating system when I buy a brand new computer.

77
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,879
Speaker 1: So anyway, Windows 10 is coming, and they're going to make it what they should have done a zillion years ago.

78
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:14,280
Speaker 1: Well, they're not doing it exactly the way they should, but it's going to be a free upgrade to anyone who's got Windows 7 or 8 or whatever.

79
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:21,238
Speaker 0: There's a pointed, important piece of what you just said, though, that even pirated copies...

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:21,701
Speaker 1: Yes.

81
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:25,580
Speaker 1: Even if you have pirated Windows 7, you can still upgrade to Windows 10.

82
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,635
Speaker 1: But, if your copy of Windows is not genuine, your Windows 10, you'll upgrade to it.

83
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:33,860
Speaker 1: It still won't be genuine.

84
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:43,932
Speaker 1: So the thing is, what they're going to be doing with Windows 10 is updating it and making sure everyone's got the newest, best... Basically trying to get everyone on the same Windows.

85
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:45,220
Speaker 1: Really, that's their goal with this.

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:54,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is actually a really good idea, because a lot of the bad things that are happening out in the wild west of the internet is because most of the world is running pirated Windows XP.

87
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,660
Speaker 1: The thing is, there's a question of if people have the ungenuine Windows 10, are they going to get updates or not?

88
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:03,568
Speaker 0: Yep.

89
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,720
Speaker 1: Because it's ungenuine.

90
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,583
Speaker 0: Also, Microsoft's fucked either way.

91
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:13,759
Speaker 0: If they say no, then half the internet is going to say, "Look at you, making the internet less secure by denying security

92
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:14,140
Speaker 0: updates.".

93
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,820
Speaker 1: Also, it's not free for business, but that makes sense.

94
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,000
Speaker 1: And, the other thing is that it's only going to be free for like a year, and then they're going to start charging for it like normal.

95
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:26,343
Speaker 1: This really doesn't make sense to me.

96
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:36,020
Speaker 1: Really, Microsoft, you want people to use your shit, you should make Windows 10 free, you should make Office 50 bucks or less for the whole thing.

97
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,779
Speaker 1: You shouldn't have all these different versions.

98
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,419
Speaker 0: Well, the target customer for Office really is businesses.

99
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should only charge... Continue to charge the businesses an arm and a leg.

100
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,317
Speaker 1: But, for regular old people, you should just make all your software way cheap and people actually buy Office.

101
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:51,160
Speaker 1: if it was affordable.

102
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,660
Speaker 0: Well, I would charge businesses.

103
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:53,965
Speaker 1: I have Office.

104
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:56,756
Speaker 1: I got one of those cheapo deals for 10 bucks or something.

105
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:58,879
Speaker 0: That's also how I have Office.

106
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,096
Speaker 1: I basically never use it.

107
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:03,500
Speaker 0: I use it all the time, but I don't ever upgrade it.

108
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,099
Speaker 1: I use the Excel spreadsheet sometimes.

109
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,420
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, because the Google spreadsheet is not...

110
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,021
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

111
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:15,278
Speaker 1: But, if you said that the brand new Office was like 30 bucks, I'd be like, "I never used that, but why

112
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:15,498
Speaker 1: not?"

113
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:16,964
Speaker 1: Just to have it.

114
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:18,593
Speaker 1: You never know when you're going to need that.

115
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:19,920
Speaker 1: It helps.

116
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:20,517
Speaker 0: Yeah.

117
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:23,500
Speaker 1: But, Microsoft, you know, you're screwing things.

118
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,839
Speaker 1: Plus, some guy out there has a Mac and they want to do boot camp, pick up a copy of Windows for nothing.

119
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,280
Speaker 1: That'd be real useful.

120
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,320
Speaker 1: But, they don't do it.

121
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:39,240
Speaker 0: I feel like we could have a long conversation about this on a Monday because there's a lot... I could talk for a good hour about just what we're talking about right now.

122
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,940
Speaker 1: But, yeah, interesting stuff going on with the Windows 10.

123
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,000
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll upgrade for free probably on my laptop or HDPC to test it out.

124
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,363
Speaker 0: My laptop, I'll upgrade.

125
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:54,240
Speaker 0: My PC, I'm pretty much buying a new PC after Windows 10 comes out because this thing, it's getting near the end.

126
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,219
Speaker 1: Mine's just fine.

127
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,159
Speaker 1: When did you make your computer?

128
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,518
Speaker 1: A few years ago.

129
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, mine's from 2009.

130
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,809
Speaker 1: Mine's not that much older.

131
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,153
Speaker 1: Anyway...

132
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:03,746
Speaker 0: My CPU is only 2.97 gigahertz.

133
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,263
Speaker 1: Mine, probably three.

134
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:08,705
Speaker 1: I don't know.

135
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:14,480
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'll upgrade to one computer to see how it goes and then do the rest if it's good.

136
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:21,540
Speaker 0: So, there is a lot of news that Scott doesn't want to talk about, like, you know, global politics and all the real stuff.

137
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,340
Speaker 1: Something doesn't matter.

138
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:29,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there is something interesting going down, not just in the Windows world, but to kind of take a page from, oh, we're slipping all our tech news into Thursday.

139
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:42,000
Speaker 0: So, there's a little, like, slap fight going on between, like, Elon Musk and Lyft CEO and the people who do Uber and Google people.

140
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:45,060
Speaker 1: He's making cars and they're driving cars.

141
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, so think about this.

142
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,260
Speaker 1: And Google is making cars that drive themselves.

143
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,059
Speaker 0: So, think about this.

144
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,820
Speaker 0: Why are they fighting?

145
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,759
Speaker 0: Let's say I make the self-driving car that works and, like, the government says, "Okay, those are allowed on the

146
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:57,980
Speaker 0: road.".

147
00:07:58,165 --> 00:07:58,379
Speaker 0: Sure.

148
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,920
Speaker 0: Only, like, how long will it be before no one ever fucking needs a cab with a driver again?

149
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:04,570
Speaker 0: Not long.

150
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,445
Speaker 0: Uber drivers are fucked.

151
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:09,980
Speaker 0: Anyone who drives cars, as far as a job, no longer has a job.

152
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,316
Speaker 0: Sure.

153
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:10,980
Speaker 0: Yeah.

154
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:22,920
Speaker 0: So, at the same time, Uber and Lyft both basically are going after the same market of you don't have a car and you need someone to drive you somewhere and you can't afford, like, a chauffeur.

155
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,540
Speaker 0: Uber is going down the road of, yeah, eventually Uber will just be nothing but self-driving cars.

156
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,339
Speaker 0: It's going to be fucking awesome.

157
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,979
Speaker 0: Oh, my gosh, no one needs to own a car.

158
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:42,960
Speaker 0: Lyft, the CEO, basically, like, a couple days ago went online and basically tried to make this argument that self-driving cars are not the future and never will be.

159
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:43,578
Speaker 1: All right.

160
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,709
Speaker 0: And it seems like he is trying to placate his drivers because they need --.

161
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:58,180
Speaker 0: basically, all the people who drive cars for a living are really -- and pay attention -- are afraid of Uber, but they're also afraid of self-driving cars.

162
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:01,480
Speaker 0: So, Lyft is trying to get all those people on their side.

163
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,728
Speaker 0: See, these companies -- Because the statement, like, what he said is ridiculous.

164
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:09,980
Speaker 0: The idea that self-driving cars won't be the only cars on the road within 100 years is ludicrous.

165
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,899
Speaker 0: 100 years?

166
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:11,991
Speaker 0: Within 100 years?

167
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:14,734
Speaker 1: He said 100 years?

168
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,094
Speaker 0: No, I said within 100 years.

169
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:16,664
Speaker 1: Oh.

170
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,899
Speaker 1: His exact -- There might be someone out there driving a car for fun.

171
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe, but maybe not on public roads.

172
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:22,679
Speaker 1: Who knows?

173
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:33,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he's basically -- a prominent CEO is taking a ridiculous position on this just to cater to people who are afraid of losing their buggy whip manufacturer jobs.

174
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,003
Speaker 1: That's not the thing to point out.

175
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:42,580
Speaker 1: The thing to point out is that these CEOs in particular, right, are, like, the most -- you know, they came out with these arguments, right?

176
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,820
Speaker 1: It's like you look at Uber and Lyft and those companies.

177
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,047
Speaker 1: Yup.

178
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:46,920
Speaker 1: You know, even Tesla, right?

179
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,483
Speaker 1: They're coming out with these arguments.

180
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:51,969
Speaker 1: When they make their company, they're like, "Oh, we're going to disrupt the market.

181
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:58,020
Speaker 1: We don't care about your law that says we can't sell cars direct to the public," even though New Jersey just flipped and is letting them do it.

182
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder who got bribed there.

183
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,456
Speaker 1: You know, Uber and Lyft are like, "We don't care about your taxi medallion laws and shit.

184
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,359
Speaker 1: We're just going to taxi

185
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:08,740
Speaker 1: anyway.".

186
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,947
Speaker 1: You know, Airbnb, they're like, "We're just going to hotel anyway.

187
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:14,117
Speaker 1: We don't care about your regulation laws and

188
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:14,458
Speaker 1: such.".

189
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:16,732
Speaker 1: Yup.

190
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,366
Speaker 1: "We'll let the free market decide.

191
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:21,337
Speaker 1: If the free market's going to decide self-driving cars, fuck

192
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:21,578
Speaker 1: you!".

193
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:22,658
Speaker 1: Yup.

194
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,941
Speaker 1: Tough shit, right?

195
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:35,498
Speaker 1: So, you know, they're fine with their philosophy when it suits them, but as soon as the philosophy's not working in their favor, then they want to be all like, you know, "Oh, we better ban that self-driving car.

196
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:36,280
Speaker 0: That's going to hurt our

197
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,540
Speaker 0: business."

198
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,540
Speaker 0: Except, I think, self-driving cars, you know, I used to be worried that governments were going to fight them.

199
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,299
Speaker 0: Like, I think New York City is going to fight self-driving taxis more than, like, some nations have waged war.

200
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:49,398
Speaker 1: Why don't we just wage war then?

201
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:59,800
Speaker 1: If all the taxi drivers go to City Hall and try to fight the self-driving car, we'll just program our self-driving car to run them over.

202
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,440
Speaker 1: There'll be a lot less votes for the anti-self-driving car crowd.

203
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:06,580
Speaker 0: I thought you were a pacifist and you were anti-murder.

204
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,728
Speaker 1: Listen, there's only one way to get things done quickly.

205
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:11,740
Speaker 1: You either wait for the old people to die or you make the old people die.

206
00:11:12,282 --> 00:11:12,980
Speaker 1: I'm in a hurry.

207
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:13,700
Speaker 0: I think...

208
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,500
Speaker 1: When you're not in a hurry, then you can wait for the old people to die.

209
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:17,640
Speaker 0: I think the old people...

210
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,591
Speaker 1: When you're getting old, well...

211
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,204
Speaker 0: Self-driving cars, this is kind of what I'm getting at.

212
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:29,439
Speaker 0: I'll link to these three articles because it's just kind of interesting to see, like, basically the Uber CEO was like, "Self-driving cars are definitely the

213
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:29,800
Speaker 0: future.".

214
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:32,318
Speaker 0: So Lyft was like, "They are definitely not the

215
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:32,520
Speaker 0: future.".

216
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:37,479
Speaker 0: And meanwhile, Musk is like, "Yeah, we're just making the Teslas better and better because fuck

217
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:37,680
Speaker 0: everybody.".

218
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:40,019
Speaker 1: Well, he should make a self-driving Tesla.

219
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,799
Speaker 0: Well, we'll give it time.

220
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,539
Speaker 1: They actually added a really interesting thing to the Tesla.

221
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:45,900
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I saw that on Slash.

222
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:53,638
Speaker 1: If you're driving a Tesla, the number one thing you worry about is, "Am I going to run out of power and be impossible for me to reach any power station for my

223
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:54,039
Speaker 1: Tesla?".

224
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,530
Speaker 1: So they have a new system.

225
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,700
Speaker 1: they just put out in an upgrade.

226
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:08,894
Speaker 1: And the new system will basically warn you if you're driving somewhere and it's like, "Listen, if you drive any further, you will not be able to recharge fucking anywhere and you will run out of battery.

227
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:11,157
Speaker 1: Turn around and go this way.

228
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:13,600
Speaker 1: That way you will stay in range and not be

229
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:13,960
Speaker 1: screwed.".

230
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,240
Speaker 0: Definitely a needed thing.

231
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:23,920
Speaker 1: So as long as you have the newest upgrade and you're not a dumbass, you will never have the situation of dead, uncharged Tesla out in the middle of nowhere.

232
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:30,480
Speaker 0: Honestly, if I have to buy a car ahead of self-driving cars, I'll probably buy a Tesla or something like that.

233
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:32,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually.

234
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:34,180
Speaker 0: They're not that expensive.

235
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,419
Speaker 1: If I had to buy a car today and I could afford any car...

236
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,539
Speaker 0: If I had to buy a car today, I would buy a Tesla.

237
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:41,580
Speaker 1: I would probably just buy like...

238
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,659
Speaker 0: Because I still live here.

239
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:44,710
Speaker 1: They have that electric BMW.

240
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,160
Speaker 1: that's probably way more practical.

241
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,946
Speaker 0: I don't know.

242
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:49,789
Speaker 0: Maybe I'd get a hybrid.

243
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:50,069
Speaker 0: I don't know.

244
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,215
Speaker 0: Maybe I'd just get like a fucking Miata Roadster.

245
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:53,559
Speaker 0: I don't know.

246
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,880
Speaker 1: I'm just going to wait for the self-driving car and then not buy a car.

247
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:06,780
Speaker 0: To turn this into Thursday news, I think this is the one and possibly only technological issue where the old people are going to be our allies.

248
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,919
Speaker 0: Not the rich people, the old people.

249
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,139
Speaker 1: Why would the old people like self-driving cars?

250
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,900
Speaker 0: Because right now...

251
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,160
Speaker 1: They're going to be afraid the self-driving cars will kill people.

252
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:17,860
Speaker 0: Old people have a lot of trouble driving and lose autonomy.

253
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,200
Speaker 1: But old people like driving despite the fact that they can't.

254
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,551
Speaker 0: But at the same time...

255
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,220
Speaker 1: And they're going to be mad if you have some newfang or a whippersnapper self-driving car that's going to kill everybody.

256
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,620
Speaker 1: More so than they're going to kill everyone driving with bad eyesight and no reflexes.

257
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,959
Speaker 0: But at the same time, I think it'll be a pretty easy sell to a lot of old people, especially like one more generation out.

258
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,867
Speaker 1: I'm sure there will be some old people who basically are having... Because it's garbage.

259
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,480
Speaker 1: And cabs are expensive.

260
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,060
Speaker 1: Exactly.

261
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,675
Speaker 1: They will be happy at a self-driving car, but...

262
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,980
Speaker 0: Enough old people... Because there is an increasing backlash against elderly drivers and the problems they're causing.

263
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:10,820
Speaker 0: I think if that backlash pushes a little bit further, once self-driving cars are feasible, that is a huge way for really old people to maintain the autonomy they had for most of their entire lives.

264
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,780
Speaker 1: But people don't vote for what's good for them.

265
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,638
Speaker 1: And the same old people, it's like, "Man, that healthcare would really help them

266
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:15,840
Speaker 1: out."

267
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,060
Speaker 1: And they vote against it anyway.

268
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:20,440
Speaker 1: So that's the reason that old people are a fucking problem.

269
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they vote against that kind of stuff because it's a very abstract problem.

270
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,760
Speaker 0: This is a very direct problem.

271
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,700
Speaker 1: They're old people.

272
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,532
Speaker 1: You basically...

273
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:28,025
Speaker 0: No!

274
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,320
Speaker 0: Scott, you don't pay attention to enough politics.

275
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,297
Speaker 0: When you put old people in front of something that directly affects them in a way that they can see...

276
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,537
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they'll say, "Oh my god, it's an evil self-driving

277
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:38,859
Speaker 1: car!".

278
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the kind of things they do.

279
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,160
Speaker 0: if it directly affects them and hurts them, or at least they think it hurts them.

280
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,419
Speaker 1: They will think that it hurts them.

281
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:46,118
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

282
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,300
Speaker 1: And they will be easily swayed by people like the Lyft CEO because they're old people.

283
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,200
Speaker 0: No, because I think there's a lot more money on the side of...

284
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,979
Speaker 1: Where is this sudden hope coming from?

285
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,200
Speaker 0: Because this is one area where those people do have real problems.

286
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,799
Speaker 1: I'll believe it well after I see it.

287
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,180
Speaker 0: You're, you know, I'm pretty fucking cynical, but you've kind of gone off the deep end of cynicism.

288
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:14,340
Speaker 1: The fact that old people are afraid of a car that drives itself, I'm pretty sure that is the much more likely scenario than old people loving some newfangled technology.

289
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, but when the choice becomes, you don't get to go anywhere ever, or...

290
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,983
Speaker 1: That choice they won't have.

291
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:24,560
Speaker 1: They'll just keep fighting to keep their driver's license, which is they have successfully done for a very long time.

292
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,995
Speaker 0: That is true, but what might also cause this is who manipulates the old people?

293
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:30,340
Speaker 0: Who does that?

294
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:33,600
Speaker 0: It's pretty much Fox News and Republicans in Congress, right?

295
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,815
Speaker 1: And why would they be in favor of the self-driving car?

296
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:36,460
Speaker 1: Because they are not.

297
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,420
Speaker 0: A lot of them don't actually have chauffeurs and drive themselves.

298
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,960
Speaker 0: All you need to do is get every one of those old-ass members of Congress free self-driving cars.

299
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,880
Speaker 1: You mean the same ones who will make laws about banning insider trading and then insider trade?

300
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,583
Speaker 1: They don't give a shit.

301
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:56,752
Speaker 1: They don't care if self-driving cars are illegal.

302
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,620
Speaker 1: They'll make them illegal and then fucking have one.

303
00:15:59,022 --> 00:15:59,699
Speaker 1: They don't give a fuck.

304
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:00,883
Speaker 0: No, but here's the problem.

305
00:16:01,104 --> 00:16:12,960
Speaker 0: If you bribe them with self-driving cars and they give them to their old relatives and all that kind of stuff, they might try to manipulate the laws to make sure they can keep playing with their toys and their families can keep playing with their toys.

306
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,534
Speaker 0: You gotta go for old, rich self-interest to then manipulate old, scared, non-self-interest.

307
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,620
Speaker 1: The old, rich self-interest is to have the toy that no one else has and make it illegal and still have it.

308
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:27,199
Speaker 0: Except on public roads, it's kinda hard to get away with that.

309
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:36,540
Speaker 1: How many Congress people have been homosexual and adulterous and then while simultaneously railing against that in Congress itself?

310
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,460
Speaker 0: However, I think that's different because a lot of those people are also religious and self-hating.

311
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,400
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

312
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:44,040
Speaker 0: I mean, they're the ones who think that up.

313
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:50,039
Speaker 0: If gay marriage were legal, then wouldn't we all just be having sex with men all the time?

314
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:59,400
Speaker 1: You were basically describing a scenario in which people who are advanced in age and/or evil are agreeing with things that young and smart people agree with.

315
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,359
Speaker 1: Sometimes that happens.

316
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,019
Speaker 1: And that is not a scenario that will ever happen.

317
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,440
Speaker 0: It only happens if the thing is in the direct self-interest of the older, rich people.

318
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:10,560
Speaker 1: 'Cause all the times when it is not in their self-interest, they still don't do it.

319
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,020
Speaker 0: Well, because the voters are manipulated.

320
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,619
Speaker 1: What is the time that this happened?

321
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:16,319
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are examples of this happening.

322
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:17,285
Speaker 1: One time.

323
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:18,271
Speaker 1: Any one time.

324
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,740
Speaker 1: Even on the tiniest issue.

325
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:21,239
Speaker 0: Alright, alright.

326
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,999
Speaker 1: The most insignificant thing.

327
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,948
Speaker 0: The most insignificant thing.

328
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:26,959
Speaker 0: Can it be on a local level or does it have to be?

329
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,460
Speaker 1: It could be like one of those fucking bills in Congress that doesn't even count for anything.

330
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:36,020
Speaker 1: Like, we're going to declare something national hoozits day in honor of this little Timmy who had cancer or something.

331
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,642
Speaker 0: Alright, you know what?

332
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:42,059
Speaker 0: Old people are generally actually really against Daylight Saving Time and yet we still have it.

333
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,420
Speaker 1: Since when are old people against Daylight Savings Time?

334
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:46,345
Speaker 0: Actually, they are.

335
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:48,780
Speaker 0: Old people and parents tend to be against Daylight Saving Time.

336
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,360
Speaker 1: I thought parents are the ones who are for Daylight Savings Time.

337
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,960
Speaker 0: No, they're for not switching and for never being in the current good time where we have more daylight at night.

338
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,113
Speaker 1: Oh, so they're for the bad thing.

339
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,442
Speaker 0: Yes.

340
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,599
Speaker 0: And they got what they wanted.

341
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:08,300
Speaker 1: Well, they got what they wanted, which is to keep the switching happening.

342
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:10,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is, I guess, they got half what they wanted.

343
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,600
Speaker 1: Which is the opposite of the smart thing, which is to only have Daylight Savings Time.

344
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,839
Speaker 0: The problem is no one's for that except, like, us.

345
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:21,720
Speaker 1: Listen, your example is not an example that met the requirements.

346
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the national level is real hard to come up with that on the fly.

347
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,820
Speaker 1: But you're saying that this one is going to happen.

348
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,860
Speaker 1: I think this one is going to happen.

349
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,357
Speaker 1: You don't have one example of it in all history, but this one, you're confident.

350
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,703
Speaker 0: Because I feel like, unlike most other political things... Rym feels it, everybody.

351
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:40,958
Speaker 1: Rym feels the world is changing, old people are suddenly smart and rich people aren't evil.

352
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:41,600
Speaker 1: It's going to happen.

353
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,899
Speaker 0: Like, you forget that, like, when it comes to computer stuff, for example...

354
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,579
Speaker 1: You heard it here first.

355
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,485
Speaker 0: It's abstract.

356
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,299
Speaker 0: Like, they have no idea what these things are.

357
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,760
Speaker 0: And 99% of what our government does is abstract, so people will vote based on...

358
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,296
Speaker 1: Because the old people are so in favor of drones delivering them goods by sky.

359
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,900
Speaker 0: They're not really comfortable with the idea of delivery, so I don't think that's even a factor.

360
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:03,385
Speaker 0: Just saying.

361
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:05,413
Speaker 1: Old people are afraid of technologies.

362
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:06,217
Speaker 1: Period.

363
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:07,000
Speaker 1: End of story.

364
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,504
Speaker 0: But you just put them in one of the cars... My mom.

365
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:14,473
Speaker 1: My grandparents.

366
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:16,160
Speaker 0: My grandpa was using the internet.

367
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,340
Speaker 1: I meant... I didn't mean an individual old person.

368
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,349
Speaker 0: That's what you said.

369
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:21,160
Speaker 0: Those are examples.

370
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,179
Speaker 1: I meant old people as a whole.

371
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,179
Speaker 0: Old people as a whole?

372
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:27,549
Speaker 0: You know what they really like?

373
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:29,840
Speaker 0: Medical technology that makes them be older.

374
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:31,420
Speaker 1: Except all they do is complain.

375
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:34,046
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what?

376
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:38,780
Speaker 0: They want hospitals, they want Social Security and Medicare to keep taking care of them, and they get that.

377
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:43,240
Speaker 0: And actually those things are probably, on the average, good things.

378
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:45,800
Speaker 1: Exactly, and they vote against those things even though they say they want them.

379
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,229
Speaker 0: No, they vote for those things because they have a good name.

380
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,940
Speaker 0: They vote against the abstract changes to those things.

381
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:52,618
Speaker 1: Let's move on to...

382
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:53,500
Speaker 0: Okay, to what?

383
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,576
Speaker 1: Something that makes sense.

384
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,734
Speaker 0: So, things of the day.

385
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:08,578
Speaker 0: I linked to an episode in a conversation on Twitter that we did back in like 2007.

386
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:10,130
Speaker 0: Because it was relevant to a discussion.

387
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:19,350
Speaker 0: Partly because a friend of ours, who we both know and hang out with often, had never seen or heard of Odoru Daiso-Sasen.

388
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,070
Speaker 0: Odoru Daiso-Sasen?

389
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,790
Speaker 0: And I realized that that is some pretty fucking vintage geek nights there.

390
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:29,850
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people we know who we did not know back when we first watched that movie.

391
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:31,138
Speaker 1: That is good shit.

392
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,670
Speaker 1: Movie, TV show, it's all good.

393
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

394
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,430
Speaker 1: The first movie's the best.

395
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,557
Speaker 1: The first movie's amazing.

396
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:36,784
Speaker 0: The TV show's really good.

397
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:37,710
Speaker 0: The second movie's okay.

398
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,790
Speaker 1: The second, I think the later seasons of the TV show, not as good as the early first season.

399
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,490
Speaker 0: I only watched like the first five episodes and it was great.

400
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,368
Speaker 1: I saw all of them.

401
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I should watch that whole thing.

402
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,829
Speaker 0: We should do a show on that show.

403
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:58,348
Speaker 1: You know, the later seasons are not... It sort of has a similar... You know, the quality of it sort of matches up nicely with the quality of another somewhat comedic police drama,

404
00:20:58,408 --> 00:20:58,869
Speaker 1: "Patlabor."

405
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:01,247
Speaker 1: Or, "You're Under

406
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:01,430
Speaker 1: Arrest.".

407
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:05,666
Speaker 1: I haven't seen... I've seen as much "You're Under Arrest" as you've seen "Odoro

408
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:06,249
Speaker 1: Daiso-Sasen.".

409
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:10,249
Speaker 0: You at least saw the episode with the hurricane and the speeder?

410
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:12,250
Speaker 1: I remember something about a hurricane.

411
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,748
Speaker 0: Every time a hurricane comes to the city...

412
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,570
Speaker 1: This was like last decade, all right?

413
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:16,837
Speaker 1: Yeah.

414
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,149
Speaker 1: More than 10 years ago.

415
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:29,919
Speaker 0: So anyway, in this conversation, it turns out that the person I mentioned this to comes back to me and basically says, "Man, what I really want to see is that catwash

416
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:30,060
Speaker 0: video.".

417
00:21:33,432 --> 00:21:35,566
Speaker 0: And I go to the actual episode page that I linked to.

418
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,050
Speaker 0: Fucking every link is broken.

419
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:38,770
Speaker 0: Of course.

420
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,269
Speaker 0: And I poked around a little bit.

421
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:46,570
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure two-thirds plus of anything we've ever linked to on Geek Nights is a broken link now.

422
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,010
Speaker 1: Probably.

423
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,869
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is I found that video again.

424
00:21:52,498 --> 00:21:52,749
Speaker 1: Okay.

425
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,970
Speaker 0: And I'm not going to go back and fix that link because that sets a precedent that I will never follow through on.

426
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:07,532
Speaker 0: But my thing of the day today was my thing of the day from 2007 re-uploaded in 2009.

427
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:08,508
Speaker 0: The catwash.

428
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:11,269
Speaker 1: Okay.

429
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:19,570
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is this dude biking on a bicycle in a ridiculously dangerous place.

430
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:19,839
Speaker 1: Nope.

431
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:20,865
Speaker 1: Nope.

432
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,160
Speaker 1: Nope.

433
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:21,445
Speaker 1: Nope.

434
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,039
Speaker 1: Nope.

435
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,850
Speaker 0: Well, Scott shows me the video.

436
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,604
Speaker 0: I'm like, "That looks pretty

437
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:24,849
Speaker 0: fun.".

438
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,250
Speaker 0: And then the camera pans around.

439
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,944
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Whoa.

440
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:27,999
Speaker 0: Never

441
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,369
Speaker 0: mind.".

442
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:28,667
Speaker 0: Nope.

443
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:34,030
Speaker 1: I don't know how this guy doesn't fall to his death, but that is why it is a video you should watch.

444
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,669
Speaker 0: You know what it's like?

445
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:38,610
Speaker 0: It's like the goats that walk on the sheer cliffs.

446
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,230
Speaker 1: I don't know how the fuck they do that.

447
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,569
Speaker 1: But this guy's on a bicycle.

448
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:42,990
Speaker 1: Bicycle.

449
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:45,149
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

450
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,429
Speaker 1: On a near horizontal, near vertical slope going sideways across it.

451
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:54,269
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, we're going to be this weekend.

452
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,643
Speaker 0: Well, next weekend.

453
00:22:56,572 --> 00:22:57,029
Speaker 0: Next weekend.

454
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,810
Speaker 0: Next weekend, the 26th or whatever, at Zenkai Con doing a bunch of panels on Saturday and Sunday.

455
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,570
Speaker 0: And then the weekend right after that, we're going to be at Anime Boston doing a bunch of panels Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

456
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:11,210
Speaker 1: You mean just Saturday and Sunday, not Friday?

457
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:14,470
Speaker 0: We'll have some panels Friday, but not in the morning.

458
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:17,110
Speaker 1: I guess if we leave early Friday morning.

459
00:23:17,332 --> 00:23:17,770
Speaker 0: We already booked.

460
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,290
Speaker 0: We're going there Friday early morning.

461
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:20,070
Speaker 1: Oh, okay then.

462
00:23:20,238 --> 00:23:20,470
Speaker 0: Yeah.

463
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,063
Speaker 1: Alright.

464
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:22,590
Speaker 0: You don't remember?

465
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,581
Speaker 0: We're taking like a 6 a.m.

466
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:24,230
Speaker 0: fucking train.

467
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:24,987
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens.

468
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,849
Speaker 0: Oh, you're going to not take that train?

469
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:28,450
Speaker 1: No, I have to take that train.

470
00:23:30,473 --> 00:23:32,670
Speaker 0: But we don't know our schedule yet for Anime Boston.

471
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:35,148
Speaker 1: Good job, Anime Boston.

472
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,210
Speaker 0: I assume we're going and presenting.

473
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,210
Speaker 0: And Zenkai Con, we know our schedule and I guess we'll link to it.

474
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,509
Speaker 0: I think it's up by now or whatever.

475
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:44,389
Speaker 0: And the Book Club book is still a water ship down.

476
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,648
Speaker 0: Scott has to read it.

477
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,370
Speaker 0: It's about rabbits.

478
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,028
Speaker 0: Pretty awesome.

479
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,110
Speaker 1: Rabbit.

480
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:48,725
Speaker 0: Yeah?

481
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,268
Speaker 0: Yeah.

482
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,768
Speaker 0: You obviously haven't read any of it yet.

483
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,510
Speaker 1: I haven't read any recently.

484
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:57,490
Speaker 0: Oh, actually one of these things today is still there.

485
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,869
Speaker 0: The Cthulhu Quiz Show.

486
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,809
Speaker 1: I don't even know what the hell that is.

487
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,389
Speaker 0: Lovecraft was a category on a mastermind in the UK.

488
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:06,290
Speaker 1: Alright.

489
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,929
Speaker 0: So that is still there.

490
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:09,527
Speaker 0: And I just liked it.

491
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:10,147
Speaker 0: So there we go.

492
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:10,808
Speaker 0: There you go.

493
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:13,030
Speaker 1: Alright.

494
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,830
Speaker 1: So we're going to talk about El San Antonio Tejas.

495
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:21,850
Speaker 0: It's kind of weird to review a place, but we ended up spending a lot of time in that place.

496
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:29,150
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I'd never been to Tejas, despite it having so many stereotypes and portrayals in media.

497
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:31,129
Speaker 1: I thought I knew stuff about it.

498
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,570
Speaker 0: I knew about it from watching Davy Crockett, particularly the Alamo.

499
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:39,989
Speaker 0: I knew about it from high school social studies class.

500
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:46,069
Speaker 1: So thanks to Pac South, we went to San Antonio and thanks to the weather in New York, we ended up staying there for an extra day or two.

501
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:54,350
Speaker 0: Now, I took a bunch of notes and I found them the other day because, you know, it's been a long time since Pac South and we didn't do a bunch of shows in that interim.

502
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:03,510
Speaker 0: So I don't have my notes on me and I'm not worried about that because there's only like two things to say about San Antonio.

503
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:10,730
Speaker 1: So, I mean, basically, you know, despite the name of the place and the fact that it's in Texas, there aren't a lot of cowboys roaming around.

504
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,228
Speaker 1: There were some.

505
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:12,610
Speaker 1: There are definitely not zero.

506
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:14,250
Speaker 0: There were a lot of cowboy hats around.

507
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:20,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it wasn't like super cowboy town, yee-haw, giddy-up, saloon action.

508
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:25,250
Speaker 1: That's a, you know, the stereotype is there and only small parts.

509
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,930
Speaker 1: It's about the same as if you come to New York.

510
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,070
Speaker 1: How many New York guys you meet on the street?

511
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:30,069
Speaker 0: Like eight or nine.

512
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:32,609
Speaker 1: Not too many.

513
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:35,488
Speaker 0: You want to get to Midtown, you got to take the BRT to the MIM.

514
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,385
Speaker 1: The BMT.

515
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about the same, right?

516
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:39,128
Speaker 0: BRT, BMT.

517
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:39,780
Speaker 1: Yeah.

518
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,010
Speaker 1: Yeah.

519
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,550
Speaker 1: You know, if you go to Boston, how many Boston, Harvard Yard guys you can see there?

520
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,370
Speaker 0: Everyone there.

521
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,609
Speaker 0: Everyone in that city is like that.

522
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,430
Speaker 1: It's about the same percentage, right?

523
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:51,889
Speaker 1: So, you know, that's different about it.

524
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:52,850
Speaker 1: The weather.

525
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,830
Speaker 1: The first day we got there, I mean, it was winter.

526
00:25:55,615 --> 00:25:56,589
Speaker 1: It was a little bit cold.

527
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,489
Speaker 0: Way too cold.

528
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,890
Speaker 1: Still warmer than New York was, which had a crazy snowstorm at the time.

529
00:26:01,914 --> 00:26:02,768
Speaker 1: But then it warmed up.

530
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:06,829
Speaker 1: It wasn't shorts weather, but, you know, for winter, I'll take it.

531
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:08,010
Speaker 0: So we'll tell the story.

532
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:18,830
Speaker 0: Before they announced where PAX was, other than that people, you know, people who was in Texas, all the people who don't know better assumed it was going to be in like Austin because that's where they know the nerds are and they like Austin.

533
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:24,070
Speaker 0: But turns out that most of the cities in Texas, despite being pretty big, are garbage for conventions.

534
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,930
Speaker 0: And Austin is like super garbage for conventions.

535
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, Austin does not have the hotels necessary to support a PAX-like convention.

536
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,250
Speaker 0: Yep, let alone the convention center space and the infrastructure.

537
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:37,490
Speaker 1: Antonio has a convention center and a lot of hotels.

538
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:39,570
Speaker 0: A really nice convention center, actually.

539
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, very nice.

540
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,750
Speaker 0: Like, I would, I prefer that convention center over PAX East convention center.

541
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:48,730
Speaker 1: I guess it has a little, it's a little more complicated to get around, but it had enough space.

542
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,930
Speaker 0: And the spaces were better in some senses.

543
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,130
Speaker 0: The expo hall was not, but at the same time, I don't like the expo halls, though.

544
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,129
Speaker 0: You can see my bias there.

545
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:05,470
Speaker 0: But we, because we'd never been to Texas, thought, all right, we'll get there like Thursday night, we'll do PAX, and then we'll stick around for a couple days and do Texas.

546
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:05,845
Speaker 0: Yep.

547
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,270
Speaker 0: That was a fucking mistake.

548
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,830
Speaker 1: And the weather kept us there an extra day.

549
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:15,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought there would be enough things to occupy a whole day of visiting San Antonio, and I actually ended up with two days to visit San Antonio.

550
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:23,670
Speaker 0: Well, first, the problem was our friends showed up like early on Thursday, spent like four hours doing everything there is to do in San Antonio, and then played board games.

551
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:24,490
Speaker 0: Yep.

552
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,690
Speaker 0: Then they all left, and we were in Texas with like two of our friends, alone.

553
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,360
Speaker 1: Yeah.

554
00:27:31,354 --> 00:27:32,269
Speaker 0: And then we both got sick.

555
00:27:32,872 --> 00:27:36,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, we ran out of things to do very quickly, and that was it.

556
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:43,650
Speaker 1: So San Antonio is a relatively high population city, but it doesn't seem like a lot of people live in the city part.

557
00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:45,829
Speaker 1: They live, you know, outside the city.

558
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,161
Speaker 0: Yeah.

559
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:50,170
Speaker 1: And it's really wide and really flat and not very tall.

560
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,149
Speaker 1: There are a few tall buildings, but not that many.

561
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,570
Speaker 1: But like the downtown, despite the fact that- Seattle had more tall buildings, despite being less populous.

562
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,290
Speaker 0: Like the population is one and a half million, like it's a huge city population-wise.

563
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:07,250
Speaker 0: But like walking around, it felt like a dumpy, Lancaster-type place.

564
00:28:07,993 --> 00:28:10,910
Speaker 0: Like walking around the streets at night, they were empty, pretty much everywhere.

565
00:28:11,631 --> 00:28:12,614
Speaker 0: All the shit was closed.

566
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:17,070
Speaker 0: A lot of places looked like Hartford-style, like you can't even go into them.

567
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:25,150
Speaker 0: And aggressive and otherwise ne'er-do-wellish characters were hassling and being around on the street all over the place.

568
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:31,350
Speaker 1: Well, part of the reason for this is because the highlight in all of San Antonio is this thing called the Riverwalk.

569
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,970
Speaker 1: So the Riverwalk is basically, there's these rivers that go around San Antonio.

570
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,290
Speaker 1: There's like a big river, and then it sort of branches off and loops around the city a bit.

571
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:42,090
Speaker 1: And that Riverwalk is like below street level.

572
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,030
Speaker 1: So all around the city, you'll see stairs that go down to the Riverwalk.

573
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:52,230
Speaker 1: And you can walk around down there, and there's a river, and you can get a boat that'll take you around that river.

574
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:56,310
Speaker 1: And it's got these nice walking paths on both sides of it.

575
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:57,850
Speaker 0: And there's a bunch of restaurants.

576
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, and all that's down there is basically tons of restaurants.

577
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:12,910
Speaker 1: And of course, if you want to walk around the city, it's easier to just go down to the Riverwalk, walk along it, not have to worry about street crossings or anything, and then go up the stairs close to your location.

578
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,590
Speaker 0: But like most of the city that we saw, we pretty much went everywhere that was in walking distance of PAX.

579
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:19,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is pretty much all of downtown.

580
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,830
Speaker 1: Every place that there was real stuff in San Antonio.

581
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,410
Speaker 0: If you leave the Riverwalk, a lot of really shitty places.

582
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:37,150
Speaker 0: And if you get to the places that have stuff going on, most of them are just parking garages and office towers and businesses you can't get into and no one on the streets.

583
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:45,150
Speaker 1: Right, well what the Riverwalk does, you gotta understand, so you'll be on the Riverwalk, and you'll see a restaurant on the Riverwalk directly.

584
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:47,696
Speaker 1: That restaurant is part of a building.

585
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:51,970
Speaker 1: If you look up at that building at street level, you'll see it's kind of tall.

586
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,109
Speaker 1: Maybe there's apartments in it or something, or offices.

587
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,784
Speaker 1: But if you go up to street level to that building, you can't really get in.

588
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:00,350
Speaker 1: There's no entrances or anything.

589
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,130
Speaker 0: There'll be a sign that's like, "Go to the Riverwalk," and a barred up door.

590
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:20,049
Speaker 1: Right, and the reason is because the restaurants are on the Riverwalk, instead of having the storage in the basement, the actual restaurant is in the basement, and the first floor is what would be the basement of any other restaurant in, say, New York City or any other city.

591
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:28,670
Speaker 1: So, on the street level where the sidewalks are and the cars are, there's a lot less storefronts and a lot less stuff in general.

592
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:41,710
Speaker 0: The other ramification of this, and this might sound very oddly specific, is that there are vents in the street around the outside of the Riverwalk, pumping out frightening quantities of foul-smelling air.

593
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:48,950
Speaker 0: Like, high pressure, like enough to, like, you will be surprised by it, and it smells like ass.

594
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,010
Speaker 1: I smelled it in a few places, not that many, though.

595
00:30:52,450 --> 00:31:03,730
Speaker 0: I bumped into it more when I, 'cause remember, I walked off a couple times at night to try to get coffee, 'cause it turns out that all the Starbuckses are, like, in office towers and in malls and things, and you just can't get coffee anymore.

596
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,898
Speaker 1: It's very Hartford-like in that sense.

597
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:09,070
Speaker 1: It's not a place, I saw one grocery store, I think.

598
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, the downtown, like, clears out.

599
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,218
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem to be a place where people live.

600
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:22,150
Speaker 1: Most of the people seem to be working, staying in hotels, going to PAX, or waiting to get some sort of public transportation or car to get in or out to go to where people actually live.

601
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,930
Speaker 0: What was really interesting is walking around the Riverwalk, 'cause, like, a lot of PAX people didn't seem to go down there for dinner.

602
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:39,670
Speaker 0: Like, we did, and, like, a lot of the enforcers did, a lot of the speakers did, but, like, the average attendees seemed to come in, do PAX, eat lunch at, like, a local place, and drive home, because 90% of PAX felt like locals.

603
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,635
Speaker 1: It was very local PAX.

604
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:46,890
Speaker 1: Not, it didn't seem like a very large number of people at all had traveled any distance to get to this PAX.

605
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,383
Speaker 0: The hotels were dead at night.

606
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:50,630
Speaker 0: Like, no one was gaming.

607
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,790
Speaker 1: Uh, no, the lobby of Hartell was pretty crazy every night.

608
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,556
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't.

609
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:56,190
Speaker 0: There were, like, 15 people down there.

610
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,701
Speaker 1: No, it was a lot, but they were all drinking.

611
00:31:57,741 --> 00:31:58,869
Speaker 1: There wasn't a lot of gaming going on.

612
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,595
Speaker 0: There was no gaming.

613
00:31:59,615 --> 00:32:01,609
Speaker 0: There were, like, 15 or 20 people standing around drinking.

614
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,250
Speaker 1: There were a lot more than 15 or 20 people getting drunk in the hotel.

615
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,590
Speaker 0: Unless you count the restaurant.

616
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, the whole, yeah, the lobby didn't have anything.

617
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,550
Speaker 1: They were all in the hotel/restaurant area getting wasted.

618
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,185
Speaker 0: Well, there was that little bar, and then there was the restaurant.

619
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:12,830
Speaker 0: The restaurant was crowded.

620
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,390
Speaker 0: The bar didn't have that many people there, 'cause it had very few tables.

621
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was no tables, but people were getting drunk instead of gaming at night.

622
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:21,110
Speaker 1: And the PAX people were still rocking the bottom of the hotel.

623
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,115
Speaker 0: No, they were not rocking it.

624
00:32:23,195 --> 00:32:28,450
Speaker 0: The people who were down there was also a lot of non-PAX people, and no one was really gaming that much.

625
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:30,770
Speaker 1: They definitely weren't gaming, 'cause there were no tables.

626
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,470
Speaker 1: But there were PAX people, you know, filling the bottom of the hotel every night of PAX.

627
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:36,590
Speaker 0: I think you misremember, there were very few people down there.

628
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,329
Speaker 1: There were people down there.

629
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:37,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

630
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,470
Speaker 0: Not that many.

631
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,190
Speaker 1: There weren't plenty.

632
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,416
Speaker 0: Noooo.

633
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:42,424
Speaker 0: I probably took some pictures with my phone.

634
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:42,989
Speaker 0: I can go look.

635
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:43,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

636
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:50,690
Speaker 0: I'm highly dubious of your accounts, 'cause I went down there to try to get a drink, and I went back upstairs because there wasn't much going on on Saturday.

637
00:32:50,851 --> 00:32:51,343
Speaker 0: Or Sunday.

638
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:51,650
Speaker 0: Sunday.

639
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,510
Speaker 1: Well, Sunday, everyone already left already.

640
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, Sunday, yeah, no one from PAX stuck around except us and the people who were stranded by the blizzard.

641
00:32:58,152 --> 00:32:59,609
Speaker 1: They bailed the hell out of that PAX.

642
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:05,708
Speaker 0: But then walking around on the riverwalk, almost everyone we ran into who was not from PAX... Was old people.

643
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:15,030
Speaker 0: Was, like, 40s and up, like, families with kids who had obviously driven in for, like, the afternoon and dinner and then were driving out.

644
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,325
Speaker 0: Yep.

645
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,921
Speaker 0: Or really, really old people, like, having dinner together.

646
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,070
Speaker 0: Or tourists taking pictures of everything.

647
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:32,170
Speaker 1: There were also a lot of military people, 'cause apparently there's a military base nearby, and when you go on leave, the thing to do is to, you know, find your family and hang out in San Antonio.

648
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,610
Speaker 1: And go get dinner on the riverwalk.

649
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:33,990
Speaker 1: Right.

650
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:38,097
Speaker 1: So, you know, the riverwalk itself is kinda nice.

651
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:39,882
Speaker 1: You walk along a river and there's restaurants.

652
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:43,650
Speaker 1: The restaurants aren't, you know, we ate at a whole bunch of 'em, not all of 'em, obviously.

653
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,250
Speaker 0: They were okay.

654
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:44,732
Speaker 1: Yeah.

655
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:47,321
Speaker 1: I mean, none of them were like, "Oh my god, this is amazing.

656
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:48,486
Speaker 1: Like, I remember that restaurant.

657
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:49,088
Speaker 1: I have to go back

658
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:49,309
Speaker 1: there.".

659
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:51,903
Speaker 1: But none of them were like, "Oh my god, it's disgusting.

660
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:52,688
Speaker 1: I'll never go back there

661
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:52,909
Speaker 1: again.".

662
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:53,351
Speaker 0: Yep.

663
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:54,855
Speaker 0: They were all, like, really average-y.

664
00:33:54,936 --> 00:33:59,610
Speaker 0: Like, I'd say a step or two down from Providence in terms of, like, the restaurant feel in that area.

665
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:10,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, you would think that, like, you know, since it was so close to Mexico, there'd be, like, some amazing fuckin' Mexican foods or really good Texas barbecue or, you know, Texas foods would be amazing.

666
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, the barbecue was okay.

667
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we had a barbecue.

668
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,179
Speaker 1: It was edible barbecue.

669
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,465
Speaker 1: I found Mexican foods.

670
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:18,130
Speaker 1: We tried, like, at least two different ones.

671
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,467
Speaker 0: We had so much free time.

672
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,730
Speaker 1: The one we had on the last night with Katsu.

673
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,859
Speaker 0: What was that place called?

674
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:23,929
Speaker 0: The Cafe Rosario?

675
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:31,250
Speaker 1: No, I forget what it was, but that was, like, the giant restaurant that had, like, rooms and rooms and rooms and it was super crowded.

676
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:42,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically, we had so much time to kill that me and Scott and Katsu, we were just, like, Googling and doing research, like, "What is the best barbecue in San Antonio?

677
00:34:42,328 --> 00:34:43,168
Speaker 0: What is the best

678
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:43,550
Speaker 0: Mexican?".

679
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,589
Speaker 0: 'Cause when we did that for PAX Australia...

680
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,409
Speaker 1: It worked really well.

681
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, we looked for... We found the best teppanyaki restaurant in Melbourne, and you know what?

682
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,830
Speaker 1: It was the best teppanyaki I've had, period.

683
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,130
Speaker 0: It was, like, a hundred bucks each.

684
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,007
Speaker 1: You get what you pay for.

685
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:57,510
Speaker 0: Oh my god, it was amazing.

686
00:34:57,798 --> 00:34:57,948
Speaker 0: Right.

687
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,170
Speaker 0: Did you go back there?

688
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:00,924
Speaker 0: The best... I didn't go back there.

689
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:01,590
Speaker 0: I went to other places.

690
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,489
Speaker 1: Mistakes.

691
00:35:04,391 --> 00:35:09,665
Speaker 0: While I had very, very good food, I felt like I did not need to have hundred dollar food.

692
00:35:09,685 --> 00:35:11,510
Speaker 0: I had, like, forty dollar sushi.

693
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,744
Speaker 1: I feel like I need that every night.

694
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:13,310
Speaker 1: Alright, anyway.

695
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:21,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, so actually, near in Melbourne by the new convention center, the food scene is the best food scene of any PAX ever.

696
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:22,869
Speaker 0: Better than PAX Prime.

697
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:29,510
Speaker 0: The food around PAX Australia in Melbourne, there is a sushi place that is fucking legit.

698
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,270
Speaker 0: And it's right there, and it was, like...

699
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:31,809
Speaker 1: Nothing's on the water.

700
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you can just walk right in, too.

701
00:35:34,855 --> 00:35:35,869
Speaker 1: More close to the New York.

702
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,569
Speaker 0: A lot closer to the New York.

703
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,493
Speaker 0: So, we were like,

704
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:38,794
Speaker 0: "Alright.".

705
00:35:38,934 --> 00:35:42,667
Speaker 0: Everyone said, like, everything on the internet said this place was the Mexican food place.

706
00:35:42,748 --> 00:35:43,370
Speaker 0: The cantina.

707
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:47,990
Speaker 0: So, we're walking there, and it's a long walk because everyone drives everywhere.

708
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:48,327
Speaker 1: Yep.

709
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:49,670
Speaker 0: And we pass.

710
00:35:49,871 --> 00:35:53,241
Speaker 1: We weren't really in downtown San Antonio anymore at this point.

711
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:56,430
Speaker 1: It was basically, like, outside of the downtown by a few blocks.

712
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,986
Speaker 0: It reminded me of a quiet version of, like, Fitzroy or, like, the weird parts of Williamsburg.

713
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,230
Speaker 0: They're kind of off the strip.

714
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:02,621
Speaker 0: Yeah.

715
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:09,126
Speaker 0: So, we're walking, we walk past a ton of, like, farm to table or wine bar.

716
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:10,830
Speaker 0: Like, the kind of places we eat at in, like, Queens.

717
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:12,495
Speaker 0: And they're all empty.

718
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:15,870
Speaker 0: Like, they're open, and there's, like, one couple eating in the restaurant.

719
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:20,162
Speaker 0: One restaurant was completely empty, and there's a waiter, like, standing outside.

720
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:22,710
Speaker 0: And he looked at us, and he didn't even try to, like, make us come in.

721
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:24,030
Speaker 1: I guess they don't do that there.

722
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:31,107
Speaker 0: So, and we're getting worried, like, "Whoa, this is all empty and scary and dark, and what's going on?

723
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:31,648
Speaker 0: Why is no one

724
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:31,929
Speaker 0: out?".

725
00:36:32,531 --> 00:36:34,722
Speaker 0: And then, we see this place in the distance.

726
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:36,310
Speaker 0: It is enormous.

727
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:39,090
Speaker 0: It had extra- Hundreds of tables.

728
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:47,530
Speaker 1: It had a back room with, like, a zillion tables that wasn't even filled yet, and there was, like, one party of, like, ten in there using a big long table, and that was it.

729
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, hundreds of tables.

730
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,430
Speaker 0: This place was enormous.

731
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,636
Speaker 1: While it was enormous, it was crowded.

732
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:57,670
Speaker 1: In the main area where the bar was and all the TVs were, it was, like, every table had people at it.

733
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,815
Speaker 0: And it was super loud, but not because of music.

734
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:02,622
Speaker 0: Just from, like, the boisterous people all talking.

735
00:37:02,642 --> 00:37:05,790
Speaker 0: And it was actually, like, it was the right volume level for that environment.

736
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,774
Speaker 0: Like, it wasn't too loud.

737
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:07,296
Speaker 0: We could talk.

738
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,910
Speaker 0: That was, like, the third best Mexican food I've ever had.

739
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it wasn't Cafe Maya.

740
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it was close, though.

741
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:18,503
Speaker 0: It's the first place I've eaten at in a long time that is even in the running.

742
00:37:19,385 --> 00:37:21,410
Speaker 0: Like, it was really, really good food.

743
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:25,110
Speaker 1: But I thought there would be a preponderance of quality Mexican, but there wasn't really.

744
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:40,369
Speaker 0: I mean, we have weird tastes because we particularly seek out, like, Yucatan-style Mexican food, which is, like, a weird, like, that is not well represented in Mexican restaurants in the U.S Anyway, but yeah, the food, alright, you know.

745
00:37:40,995 --> 00:37:42,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, hard to get breakfast.

746
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,876
Speaker 1: Very hard to get breakfast.

747
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:46,248
Speaker 1: There were not, like, diners or, you know.

748
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,657
Speaker 0: There was one diner.

749
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,170
Speaker 0: We ate there, like, three times.

750
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was one place we ate at a lot.

751
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:53,090
Speaker 1: Very frequently.

752
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:56,904
Speaker 1: You know, it also had, you know, it was like a German kind of place.

753
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:57,567
Speaker 1: It had, you know.

754
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,348
Speaker 0: Shiloh's you're thinking of.

755
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, it had wieners.

756
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:03,405
Speaker 1: They had, you know, pancakes.

757
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:04,590
Speaker 1: They had all that kind of good stuff.

758
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:08,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, just, like, good old, like, German/diner food, like, comfort food.

759
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:08,750
Speaker 0: That was a really good place.

760
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a deli situation.

761
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:12,390
Speaker 1: It was right next to our hotel and the convention center.

762
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:15,810
Speaker 1: So, it was very crowded there on the PAX days, on the good hours.

763
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:18,358
Speaker 1: But it was very good.

764
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:21,290
Speaker 1: But it wasn't like any food you can't get anywhere else.

765
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:25,130
Speaker 1: It was just a really convenient, good place to eat at for that location.

766
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:30,090
Speaker 0: So, I feel like there is, at most, one and a half days of stuff to do in that city.

767
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,970
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, there are things that you could do there that would take longer, right?

768
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,300
Speaker 1: So, we saw that they had, like, a big concert hall.

769
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,610
Speaker 1: So, it's like we could have gone to see, like, performances there.

770
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there wasn't much on the schedule.

771
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,678
Speaker 1: There's the Alamo Drafthouse.

772
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,490
Speaker 1: You can go see a movie there and it's all fancy.

773
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,150
Speaker 0: They were showing, like, boob animes that we didn't bother.

774
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was actually an anime night because we were there an extra day.

775
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,686
Speaker 1: But it was, like, Funimation's night and it was garbage anime.

776
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,610
Speaker 1: So, and whatever.

777
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, really booby.

778
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,579
Speaker 1: You can see the Alamo itself.

779
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,470
Speaker 1: That takes about an hour if you take your time.

780
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,810
Speaker 0: Well, if you really, really, you could get maybe two hours out of that place.

781
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,630
Speaker 1: If you read every single plaque.

782
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:03,210
Speaker 0: Which we did.

783
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,437
Speaker 1: So, the Alamo is a famous place.

784
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:07,245
Speaker 1: Not going to talk about the history of the Alamo.

785
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:08,250
Speaker 1: You can Wikipedia that.

786
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:15,303
Speaker 1: But the thing they don't tell you because they don't allow video or photos of the inside is that inside of it is pretty much a gun museum.

787
00:39:15,846 --> 00:39:16,450
Speaker 1: It's just guns.

788
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,162
Speaker 0: Well, there was a special gun exhibit.

789
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:19,028
Speaker 0: That's what was going on.

790
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:19,848
Speaker 0: Oh, was it?

791
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,590
Speaker 0: That's not permanent.

792
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,050
Speaker 1: Oh, what's usually in there then?

793
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:22,495
Speaker 0: I don't know.

794
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:23,670
Speaker 0: They move stuff around, I guess.

795
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:28,970
Speaker 1: Inside the Alamo itself, the main building, I mean, I guess the whole thing is the Alamo, right?

796
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,136
Speaker 1: Yeah.

797
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,190
Speaker 1: It was mostly just guns in cases.

798
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was a special exhibit.

799
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:39,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, you know, the rest of it is just, like, is the history of the Alamo and there's a gift shop and there's a library and there's a nice garden.

800
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,290
Speaker 0: It was, like, really balanced and interesting.

801
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,930
Speaker 1: It doesn't cost anything to go in there?

802
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,741
Speaker 0: Yeah, it set up, like, the history before and after and during.

803
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:47,047
Speaker 0: It was a really good museum, actually.

804
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,646
Speaker 1: It's not a waste of your time to go see it.

805
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:56,750
Speaker 1: And the history that they presented there was not, like, a ridiculous made-up history like some museums in other countries.

806
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:57,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, Turkey.

807
00:39:58,251 --> 00:40:00,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it just doesn't take a lot of time.

808
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:01,870
Speaker 1: It's, like, a quick stop.

809
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:07,050
Speaker 0: I think we burned about three and a half hours in there, but that involved, like, an hour of just sitting in the very pleasant gardens.

810
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:10,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just sat in the garden, like, "Ah, wow, it's nice and warm.

811
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:10,387
Speaker 1: Isn't this

812
00:40:10,427 --> 00:40:10,708
Speaker 1: great?".

813
00:40:11,131 --> 00:40:12,830
Speaker 1: Right now in New York, there's a horrible snowstorm.

814
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:19,288
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're in San Antonio, like, take half a day in the Alamo area and just literally, like, hang out in those gardens and just relax.

815
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:19,930
Speaker 0: It's really pleasant.

816
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,530
Speaker 1: There's not much else you're going to do anyway.

817
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:21,990
Speaker 0: Yeah.

818
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:24,608
Speaker 1: We went to, like, every museum in the whole city.

819
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:27,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, we even went to -- so we're walking around.

820
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,130
Speaker 0: So we went to -- they have, you know, the World's Fair there a long time ago.

821
00:40:30,392 --> 00:40:31,069
Speaker 1: Super long time ago.

822
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:37,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they had this tower, and it's one of those, like, "We made this tower for the World's Fair,".

823
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,270
Speaker 0: but they kept it going.

824
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,541
Speaker 0: And there's this whole, like, Tower of the Americas park around it.

825
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:45,330
Speaker 0: that's kind of like if Queens was in more repair.

826
00:40:46,453 --> 00:40:47,910
Speaker 0: And it was pleasant.

827
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:48,890
Speaker 0: Yeah.

828
00:40:49,392 --> 00:40:51,990
Speaker 0: That killed two hours walking around.

829
00:40:53,210 --> 00:41:04,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went to the -- I think it was a mine or something like that.

830
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,232
Speaker 0: Or, like, a refinery.

831
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:13,550
Speaker 0: Like, we couldn't really tell, but it was really big to the point that we were trying to, like, figure out how far away it was to make sure it wasn't as big as we thought it was.

832
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,450
Speaker 1: We put some money in, like, the binocular machine to see this thing, and it was enormous.

833
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, enormous enough to be startling.

834
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:22,129
Speaker 0: Yeah.

835
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:27,990
Speaker 0: And because it's so flat and nothing's tall, like, you can see things that are really far away, and it's so dry.

836
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:33,890
Speaker 1: And there was a lot of stuff between us and this thing, but it was really tall, like, above the horizon.

837
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,764
Speaker 0: And really just blocky and huge and awesome.

838
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:37,830
Speaker 0: Like, that's where Ava's are.

839
00:41:37,972 --> 00:41:38,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

840
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,268
Speaker 1: There's some kind of infrastructure mine thing out there.

841
00:41:42,308 --> 00:41:42,570
Speaker 1: I don't know.

842
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:48,849
Speaker 0: So then, like, we come out of that thing, and we're kind of walking around with Katsu, and we pass by this museum, and we're like, "Whoa, what's

843
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:49,050
Speaker 0: this?".

844
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:49,739
Speaker 1: It's free!

845
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,369
Speaker 1: Let's go in!

846
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, we go in, and -- The guy who's in there was so happy that someone was coming in.

847
00:41:53,753 --> 00:41:54,089
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

848
00:41:54,254 --> 00:41:54,789
Speaker 0: It was a free museum.

849
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was beside himself.

850
00:41:56,797 --> 00:42:00,570
Speaker 0: We go in, it was, like, this awesome, like, Mexican-American art and culture museum.

851
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, we saw lots of cool Mexican-American arts in there.

852
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:04,130
Speaker 1: It was really nice.

853
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:08,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are all these exhibits and, like, different movements in, like, Mexican art specifically.

854
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:17,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, because the place is so close to Mexico, right, San Antonio, there's a lot of Mexican things there besides food, and especially museums and the arts.

855
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:21,203
Speaker 1: So it's, like, a lot of Maya, Inca, Aztec-type art exhibits and things.

856
00:42:21,284 --> 00:42:23,030
Speaker 1: If you're going to museums, you're gonna see a lot of it.

857
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:30,430
Speaker 1: You don't see too much of it just out and about in the city, but as soon as you go in anywhere, you see a lot of that, a lot of that everywhere.

858
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:34,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we also went to, like, the big art museum, which was, like, a city art museum.

859
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:42,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, but since we had the extra day, we just went walking on the Riverwalk as far as we could because nothing else to do, and we stumbled across, like, the main art museum.

860
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,586
Speaker 1: It was, like, the, you know, the big one of the city.

861
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,810
Speaker 0: The thing is, it was a long walk away.

862
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:52,369
Speaker 1: We didn't even see it, and this is a real-sized museum, the kind you can't see all of in one day unless that's all you do.

863
00:42:53,090 --> 00:43:02,010
Speaker 1: You know, they had some Greeks and Roman statues, and they had, you know, actual old, you know, Aztec Maya arts and Native American stuff.

864
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the special exhibit was the Rockefellers had commissioned a bunch of Picasso tapestries.

865
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:15,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, they commissioned this French weaver to weave tapestries that were the same as Picasso paintings, and they were in this museum, and that was pretty cool.

866
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:17,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott got in trouble for taking pictures of him, though.

867
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:18,830
Speaker 1: I didn't actually take a picture of one.

868
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:19,569
Speaker 1: You were going to.

869
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,046
Speaker 1: I was gonna.

870
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:22,730
Speaker 0: To be fair, the guy got kind of surly with us.

871
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,041
Speaker 1: The guy got surly, and I was like, "I didn't see any sign.

872
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:25,764
Speaker 1: that said I can't,".

873
00:43:25,784 --> 00:43:26,989
Speaker 1: and he's like, "Yeah, there's two signs out

874
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:27,110
Speaker 1: there.".

875
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:27,762
Speaker 0: He was like, "There's signs

876
00:43:27,823 --> 00:43:28,170
Speaker 0: everywhere.".

877
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,790
Speaker 1: When I went out there, there were two signs out in the front, just by the door.

878
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:33,389
Speaker 0: On either side of the door, far apart.

879
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:35,202
Speaker 1: One of them didn't say anything about photos.

880
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:36,270
Speaker 1: It said something about something else.

881
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,970
Speaker 0: It said, "No food or drink," and the other one looked identical unless you got way close to it.

882
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:49,230
Speaker 1: It was a small sign, maybe four inches to six inches square, and in a relatively small font.

883
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:53,709
Speaker 1: It should have had a picture of a camera with a big red circle with a line through it.

884
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,762
Speaker 1: It just said, "Yeah, no photography in

885
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:57,043
Speaker 1: here.".

886
00:43:58,631 --> 00:44:00,059
Speaker 0: See, think about this UX experience.

887
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,050
Speaker 0: You have two signs that look identical from a distance.

888
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,882
Speaker 0: One of them says, "No food," and one of them says, "No

889
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:04,446
Speaker 0: photography.".

890
00:44:04,487 --> 00:44:04,890
Speaker 0: Guess what?

891
00:44:06,112 --> 00:44:10,470
Speaker 1: If you go to museums in New York, they have the picture of the camera with the big red Ghostbusters thing around it.

892
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,686
Speaker 1: They put it on fucking every wall like, "Fuck

893
00:44:12,706 --> 00:44:12,868
Speaker 1: you.".

894
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,605
Speaker 0: "It's right

895
00:44:13,626 --> 00:44:13,730
Speaker 0: there.".

896
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,095
Speaker 1: "No excuses, assholes.

897
00:44:15,377 --> 00:44:18,328
Speaker 1: We're an asshole museum that won't let you take pictures when we should just let

898
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:18,449
Speaker 1: you.".

899
00:44:19,175 --> 00:44:20,690
Speaker 0: It was a pleasant museum.

900
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:21,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, very nice.

901
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,542
Speaker 0: Very, very standard museum.

902
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:24,390
Speaker 0: I saw a bunch of stuff.

903
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:25,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, cool stuff.

904
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:32,590
Speaker 0: I spent a lot of time trying to place what was going on in these Inca Aztec Mayan times next to what was going on in other parts of the world.

905
00:44:32,811 --> 00:44:45,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, since there aren't a lot of arts from that particular region up in this part of the country, we were able to look and see timelines of like, "Oh, at the same time, Aztecs doing this, Romans doing

906
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:45,969
Speaker 1: that.".

907
00:44:46,613 --> 00:44:49,489
Speaker 1: Ooh, history books don't usually teach you that very well.

908
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:49,881
Speaker 1: Yeah.

909
00:44:50,192 --> 00:44:50,681
Speaker 1: I get it.

910
00:44:50,762 --> 00:44:51,190
Speaker 1: All right.

911
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,358
Speaker 0: That killed four hours.

912
00:44:52,378 --> 00:44:54,010
Speaker 0: That was a pleasant time, and the walk was pretty good.

913
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:54,257
Speaker 0: Yeah.

914
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:59,430
Speaker 0: Though the Riverwalk pretty much is just a jogging trail after a few blocks of restaurants.

915
00:44:59,651 --> 00:45:09,370
Speaker 1: The part of it that's a circle that goes around the inside of the city and is in near the hotels and everything, that part has all the restaurants and everything, but it keeps going.

916
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:13,990
Speaker 1: The river keeps going, and there's even locks and stuff where it hits the real river.

917
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:15,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had so much time.

918
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,850
Speaker 0: We saw the locks were going to be used.

919
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,804
Speaker 0: We waited and watched the full locking process.

920
00:45:19,824 --> 00:45:20,870
Speaker 0: What else are we going to do?

921
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:24,130
Speaker 1: But when you go there, there's no restaurants anymore.

922
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,070
Speaker 0: There's nothing.

923
00:45:26,213 --> 00:45:29,530
Speaker 0: You go up out of the Riverwalk, and there's just the backs of condos.

924
00:45:31,091 --> 00:45:34,729
Speaker 0: What's weird is that biking, they encourage like, "Oh, yeah, it's also a bike

925
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:34,970
Speaker 0: path.".

926
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just want to fall in the river, don't you?

927
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,170
Speaker 0: That thing is not a bike path.

928
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:43,330
Speaker 0: One, if we were biking, it would have taken us like four minutes to get to that museum.

929
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:44,127
Speaker 1: Also the stairs.

930
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,335
Speaker 0: But yet we saw tourists.

931
00:45:48,158 --> 00:45:52,050
Speaker 0: I can't imagine tourists don't fall into that river every day somewhere.

932
00:45:52,634 --> 00:45:53,704
Speaker 1: I didn't see anyone fall in.

933
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:54,410
Speaker 1: I was waiting for it.

934
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,138
Speaker 0: I was amazed.

935
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:55,745
Speaker 0: no one fell in.

936
00:45:58,092 --> 00:46:01,207
Speaker 1: San Antonio otherwise just didn't have anything going on.

937
00:46:01,227 --> 00:46:01,790
Speaker 1: that was memorable.

938
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:12,050
Speaker 0: It has a huge population, and it has some of the things that come with a huge population, like relatively good restaurants and concentration, art big for real museums.

939
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,148
Speaker 1: A convention center.

940
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:18,190
Speaker 0: But it didn't have any of the other things that big cities have.

941
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:23,230
Speaker 0: Boston is a way, way smaller city, both by size and population.

942
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:25,850
Speaker 0: Yet Boston feels like a city.

943
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,050
Speaker 0: Boston feels like there's stuff around you, like I can find a restaurant and a bodega.

944
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:34,170
Speaker 1: Basically, even during weekdays, there were really no cars.

945
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,949
Speaker 1: I mean, there were cars, but it wasn't high traffic ever.

946
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,269
Speaker 1: Whereas in Boston, it's like cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars, cars.

947
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,649
Speaker 1: Constantly, and all the roads.

948
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:47,790
Speaker 1: Also, they have a sports team, the Spurs.

949
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,270
Speaker 0: I just saw the Spurs get their asses kicked by the Knicks.

950
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:53,550
Speaker 1: But that stadium is well out of the town.

951
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:56,029
Speaker 1: It's not like it's in downtown or anything.

952
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:02,650
Speaker 1: Boston, a smaller city, has a baseball stadium right in the city.

953
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,370
Speaker 1: And that causes a lot of happening stuff to happen.

954
00:47:06,111 --> 00:47:19,770
Speaker 0: What was interesting though, I remember we went up into that tower, and there were people who have houses, like regular old houses with yards, like I lived in suburbia, that were easily like a 10-minute bike ride from the center of downtown.

955
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,446
Speaker 1: Yup.

956
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:21,464
Speaker 0: That was weird.

957
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:22,910
Speaker 1: Houses with backyards.

958
00:47:23,912 --> 00:47:24,086
Speaker 0: Yeah.

959
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,190
Speaker 0: And I looked at like, they're not even that expensive.

960
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,010
Speaker 1: The Alamo Dome was there.

961
00:47:30,071 --> 00:47:30,728
Speaker 1: We can see that.

962
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:35,210
Speaker 1: That's where, I forget which college football team, it belongs to a university.

963
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:37,950
Speaker 1: But it's ginormous because it's college football, right?

964
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:40,450
Speaker 1: And that's just outside the city near those houses.

965
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:44,450
Speaker 0: There was that weird building that had all the defensive-looking berms around it and things.

966
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,190
Speaker 0: We didn't quite figure, it was like some cultural institute.

967
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:49,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then there's like a judge training center or something.

968
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:49,635
Speaker 1: Yeah.

969
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:56,630
Speaker 1: It got all kinds of, you know, there's stuff there, but it's very wide, very spread out, very not-.

970
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:04,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get the impression that the nightlife there is, if you live out in the suburbs, and you drive into the downtown to do stuff, and then drive back home.

971
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,530
Speaker 0: So you don't get like the benefits of living- Or you do stuff out in that suburb.

972
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,270
Speaker 1: You don't really need to come all the way to the downtown.

973
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'd be like living in Beacon if Beacon were closer to like a place with jobs.

974
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:16,447
Speaker 1: Yup.

975
00:48:17,011 --> 00:48:18,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are definitely places to work there.

976
00:48:18,903 --> 00:48:19,110
Speaker 0: Yup.

977
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:22,950
Speaker 0: But like the downtown just felt really hollow and empty.

978
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:28,510
Speaker 0: And we spent a lot of time walking around like during weekdays, during weeknights, weekend days, weekend nights.

979
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:30,530
Speaker 0: They all felt pretty much the same.

980
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:34,890
Speaker 0: Like rush hour, you didn't see more people, you just saw like more traffic leaving.

981
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:40,450
Speaker 0: And like restaurant time, it got crowded, but it was only like tourists and like- PAX people.

982
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, tourists and PAX people and old people and families.

983
00:48:44,271 --> 00:48:47,809
Speaker 0: It is weird that we saw a lot of people who were obviously like on vacation there.

984
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:48,670
Speaker 0: Yeah.

985
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:52,910
Speaker 0: Like I can't imagine going there just to be there.

986
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,490
Speaker 0: Like unless I was on a road trip on my way to somewhere else, I would not go to San Antonio.

987
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:00,290
Speaker 1: Well I imagine that kind of vacation isn't like you come spend a week in San Antonio.

988
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:03,070
Speaker 1: It's like maybe you live in Dallas.

989
00:49:03,512 --> 00:49:03,688
Speaker 0: Yeah.

990
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:08,410
Speaker 1: And it's like alright, why don't we go, you know, have a nice weekend, let's go to San Antonio.

991
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:08,700
Speaker 1: Yeah.

992
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:09,790
Speaker 1: It's nicer than Dallas for a weekend.

993
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:16,110
Speaker 0: But like I like Providence, but I would only ever visit Providence primarily to see some friends, not to see the Providence things.

994
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:16,729
Speaker 1: No.

995
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,730
Speaker 1: But if you're old and you're retired, what else are you going to do?

996
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:20,449
Speaker 0: Play games.

997
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:21,007
Speaker 1: Yes.

998
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:31,450
Speaker 0: So yeah, San Antonio, I'll probably see you again next year because I guess I'll just go to PAX again, but- Yeah, but otherwise- Yeah, I'm coming in Thursday night and I'm leaving Monday morning.

999
00:49:32,713 --> 00:49:34,529
Speaker 1: I might even leave Sunday night just to get the hell out.

1000
00:49:34,936 --> 00:49:35,227
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

1001
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,190
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1002
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,929
Speaker 0: I like having dinner and hanging out after a PAX.

1003
00:49:38,432 --> 00:49:39,910
Speaker 1: I can get a really late flight.

1004
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,110
Speaker 1: I still won't go to work Monday.

1005
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:43,586
Speaker 0: True.

1006
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:44,368
Speaker 0: I've done that.

1007
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:47,530
Speaker 0: I don't like having the flight hanging over my head.

1008
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:48,760
Speaker 1: Anyway.

1009
00:49:49,255 --> 00:49:49,322
Speaker 0: Yup.

1010
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,120
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
