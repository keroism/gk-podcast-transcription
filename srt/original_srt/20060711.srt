7
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:36,630

19
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:32,414
Speaker 2: We have a forum front row crew.com slash forum where you talk about stuff.

20
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:33,878
Speaker 1: It's real happening.

21
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:38,336
Speaker 1: in fact right now There's a huge flame war going on about libertarianism and jury nullification.

22
00:01:38,657 --> 00:01:50,919
Speaker 2: awesome and Yeah, that frapper map is like a. you just add little push pins to it so we know where the listeners are and Email us if you want to tell us something or have us say something on the show or anything at all.

23
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:53,417
Speaker 2: It's geek nights at front row crew.com.

24
00:01:54,503 --> 00:02:04,120
Speaker 1: Yep, and actually in relation to that we got some feedback from The news story I covered yesterday on open DNS, and I'm not really gonna go over it.

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:15,676
Speaker 1: We're gonna save this for probably next Monday, but the guy the open DNS guy Who was all over slash shot was all over geek nights, and he posted in our forums.

26
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:17,020
Speaker 1: They emailed us like three times.

27
00:02:17,463 --> 00:02:21,488
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know how he found us from Wherever he was.

28
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,100
Speaker 2: I mean what did we link to slash that right?

29
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,459
Speaker 1: I linked to the slash dot article unless slash dot told him or he happened already be a listener geek nights Which I guess we'll find out because I'm talking about it today.

30
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:37,318
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess if he's a listener geek nights, or maybe he just started listening because you know, but we'll find out.

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,605
Speaker 1: yep That was a nice add-on to that.

32
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:44,420
Speaker 1: we got all the equipment finally to integrate Skype into our daily podcasting.

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:52,240
Speaker 1: So we might try to get this guy on the show as a test and just to hear what he has to say Or we might get do a whole Thursday of prank calls.

34
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:54,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that is gonna be great.

35
00:02:55,381 --> 00:03:05,400
Speaker 1: But I mean we go four nights a week Monday and every day every night is a different topic or set of topics And there's a different RSS feed both in iTunes and on the website for each one of the days.

36
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:12,660
Speaker 1: So if you don't like anime But you like video games and technology you can just listen to Monday Tuesday and Thursday or just Monday or whatever you want.

37
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:27,231
Speaker 2: Yep, or you of course there is the mega feed which gives you all of the geek nights Which is the most popular feed scarily enough yep, and that also includes the unscheduled special geek night specials of which there has been One special geek night special special.

38
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,300
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's not gonna be too many of those.

39
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:32,410
Speaker 1: No, those are when we cop out or out of town or something weird.

40
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,112
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

41
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:46,375
Speaker 1: All right, so then without further ado I'll jump right into the news because There's been a lot of ongoing debate in our forums and with our listeners as to the relative merits of the Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP.

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,140
Speaker 1: Now one the observation I would like to make that I'll talk about a lot more tomorrow.

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,210
Speaker 1: But because this is gaming day and we were at Kinetic on over the weekend.

44
00:03:55,631 --> 00:04:12,539
Speaker 1: I can say that the DS was Crazy at Kinetic on Larry crazy or so than any convention I've been to yet during the big uber web comics panel Which is one of the big like well-known draw events of this con.

45
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:22,591
Speaker 1: channel a on DS picto chat was completely full and it was like there was a simulcast of The entire panel in picto chat while it was going on.

46
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:24,317
Speaker 2: Was there any overflow to channel B?

47
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:25,020
Speaker 1: I don't know.

48
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,067
Speaker 1: I was in channel a Awesome where all the cool people were.

49
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:30,400
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah channel B people can go to doesn't it?

50
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,072
Speaker 2: Like, you know kind of hang up and you can't send so many messages.

51
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:36,018
Speaker 1: No, it worked perfectly.

52
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:37,183
Speaker 2: really I think.

53
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:42,891
Speaker 1: what it is is that every time we've had trouble it's because there's someone's Misconfigured or annoying Wi-Fi in the area.

54
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,920
Speaker 2: It could be we need to do some experiment.

55
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,422
Speaker 1: I remember it.

56
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:48,692
Speaker 1: Otakon channel D worked real well, but channel a just.

57
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:50,799
Speaker 2: but the Nintendo store remember it was sucking.

58
00:04:50,819 --> 00:05:01,140
Speaker 1: bad Yeah, but that might also be like there was a perfect number of DS's and the big thing was they were all in the same Room, except for one guy who was doing security on the other side of a flimsy wall.

59
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:10,496
Speaker 1: The picto chat only seems to break down if you've got like one or two people who are real far away or breaking up Or if it starts relaying or anything bad starts going on.

60
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:11,059
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

61
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:17,016
Speaker 1: But yeah, in fact, I did not see a single PSP, but I saw at least 50 DS's.

62
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:19,989
Speaker 2: no exaggeration Alright, so what's the news?

63
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,135
Speaker 2: Well, this isn't news.

64
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,140
Speaker 2: This is common sense

65
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:43,096
Speaker 1: Yeah but the news here is that a lot of our listeners had been arguing earlier that that while the DS is Farring away the winner in Japan and while the DS is the winner in the United States by a significant margin that is growing every day In Europe the DS wasn't doing so well and the PSP was winning.

66
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:50,970
Speaker 1: and the actual numbers which are not too easy to verify because Nintendo says how many units they sell and Sony shows.

67
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,256
Speaker 1: that says how many units they ship to retailers.

68
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:54,400
Speaker 1: big difference there.

69
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:58,473
Speaker 1: But the actual numbers show that the DS and the PSP were pretty much neck-and-neck.

70
00:05:58,895 --> 00:06:12,320
Speaker 1: the DS lite which was released I think 10 days ago in Europe in the EU has sold I think 200,000 already and the DS is now far and away the winner in the European market.

71
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:20,519
Speaker 1: Also, the the nice interesting bit about this release was that the new black DS light was released there and currently only there.

72
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:36,285
Speaker 2: Aha, so, of course the people are thinking hey Maybe the only reason so many DS lights sold in Europe is because people from America and Japan are buying black DS lights and having them imported back to US and Japan.

73
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:40,040
Speaker 1: now, it sounds like a real intriguing idea and Scott and I were talking about this before the show.

74
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,290
Speaker 1: Well, we were actually cooking dinner and one it.

75
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:48,580
Speaker 1: while that may be true The number of people who do that sort of thing is very small compared to the number of gamers.

76
00:06:49,021 --> 00:07:05,700
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know whenever I go to a con or some event like waiting in line at the Nintendo Store There's always maybe two guys at most five would be like a crazy Over-estimation of how many people have crazy imported stuff.

77
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:14,890
Speaker 2: most people just have what's available in their country and a very very few people actually pay a Tajillion dollars for crazy imports like that.

78
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:21,207
Speaker 1: Yep, so it really couldn't have been a big impact You know, what was more it's definitely not anywhere near 200,000 maybe a thousand.

79
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:26,071
Speaker 1: there was a case with this whole release of 12,000 DS's that were stolen.

80
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:33,020
Speaker 1: They were in such high demand that these were stolen and may or may not have been sold on the black market.

81
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:36,278
Speaker 2: Additionally, yeah, they stole like a whole boatload, right?

82
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:40,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, like 12,500 I believe is the number or a truckload or it's crazy.

83
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:42,358
Speaker 1: It's a lot of DS lights.

84
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:42,980
Speaker 2: That is.

85
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:45,675
Speaker 1: How did anyone stealing any PSP's?

86
00:07:47,561 --> 00:08:02,560
Speaker 2: In fact, there's a. there's a picture of a PSP being used in a Japanese convenience store as a little Advertising display and it's just showing a rotating ad to buy some insoles for shoes.

87
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:07,685
Speaker 2: now pretty Creative use of the BSB.

88
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:07,966
Speaker 2: Yeah.

89
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:12,840
Speaker 1: Now the news is simply that the the DS is now winning in every global market.

90
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:13,943
Speaker 1: I mean Sony.

91
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,028
Speaker 2: well Japan US and Europe.

92
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:17,672
Speaker 2: It's not winning in Africa.

93
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:18,634
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing.

94
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:31,751
Speaker 1: South America is the thing Russia Sony the the only number they were released is they claim that they have shipped six million PSP's to Everywhere in the world other than Japan and the United States of America.

95
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:40,318
Speaker 1: So that includes South America, Canada all of Europe all of Africa Australia everywhere except Japan in Mexico the Caribbean.

96
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:50,936
Speaker 1: and Yet the number of units Nintendo has sold as in consumers purchased Five million four hundred thousand something DS is just in Europe.

97
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,467
Speaker 2: Oh Yeah, yeah.

98
00:08:53,527 --> 00:09:02,757
Speaker 1: Yeah now couple this with the news It's old news that the UMD format is basically being discontinued for absolute lack of sales.

99
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:06,142
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and the fact that Really?

100
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:08,831
Speaker 1: No, almost no games have come out for the PSP in a while.

101
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:11,300
Speaker 2: now that I think games are coming out for it.

102
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,767
Speaker 2: The thing is is that none.

103
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:13,149
Speaker 2: it's like.

104
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:15,219
Speaker 2: the DS has a shit ton of games, right?

105
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:18,060
Speaker 2: But people only talk about the big games.

106
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,513
Speaker 2: They're mountains and mountains of crap games that no one talks about.

107
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:23,400
Speaker 2: But if you go to GameStop you see him on the shelf.

108
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,074
Speaker 2: Yeah, but no one Has a whole bunch of games.

109
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:30,020
Speaker 2: There's some mega There's like two Megaman games and all kinds of stuff.

110
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:37,580
Speaker 2: But people only talk about like three or four of them and I haven't seen any talk about any newer games at all.

111
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,211
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean new games come out.

112
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:40,500
Speaker 1: just no one talks about them at all.

113
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:45,000
Speaker 2: I should go look at a PSP blog and see if there's any good stuff on it.

114
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,326
Speaker 2: Someone send me a link to a good PSP blog.

115
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:57,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, honestly, I'd consider buying a PSP just so I could talk about it more Erudite Lee, but I would consider buying it if the price is much much less maybe under 100 bucks.

116
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,843
Speaker 1: Yeah, look at this way.

117
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,877
Speaker 1: We just bought a Mac Mini and we still think the PSP is overpriced for what it does.

118
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:13,800
Speaker 1: Yeah The Mac Mini was a little overpriced Yeah, but I get the fact that it also replaced our broken DVD player as venerable and awesome as it was in its day.

119
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,224
Speaker 1: Fastest Prime.

120
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:18,595
Speaker 2: Yeah, it actually you know, while it's an expensive DVD player.

121
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:23,272
Speaker 1: It is a pretty good DVD player Yeah, and it does a lot of other things we needed and it's quiet.

122
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:25,260
Speaker 2: Yeah, very quiet and very small.

123
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:27,942
Speaker 1: I mean I could have made a Micro ATX.

124
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:31,612
Speaker 2: maybe we should get a new like better stand for the TV.

125
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:37,529
Speaker 2: that'll look better with such little small amounts of equipment Like a shiny black or brushed steel or something.

126
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:42,222
Speaker 2: Yeah, something like that only with like thin shelves or something, you know or less shells You know what?

127
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:46,659
Speaker 1: The only reason I haven't done that yet is that the TV stand we have is free.

128
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,093
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is and it's perfectly serviceable.

129
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:57,100
Speaker 2: I know I Have a. really everything we've ever bought seems to be something new or something broke and we're replacing it.

130
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,955
Speaker 2: We've never replaced something that was working and functioning perfectly.

131
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:03,500
Speaker 2: There was one something better.

132
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:04,519
Speaker 1: There is one case.

133
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,153
Speaker 1: Alright We had an RIT.

134
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:10,874
Speaker 1: My dad before I went to college for my apartment gave me a couch and a loveseat.

135
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:12,880
Speaker 1: with a couch and loveseat were white.

136
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:18,234
Speaker 1: They were put into our apartment at RIT when we moved out several years later.

137
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:22,280
Speaker 1: They were no longer white They were far from it.

138
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,560
Speaker 1: They were this dark shade of gray and I didn't realize how bad it had gotten until we brought them somewhere with better lighting.

139
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:32,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I flipped over a cushion and it was all this white and it was whoa.

140
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:47,550
Speaker 1: So we threw away the couch, but we only threw it away because Emily and her family and their infinite generosity gave us a better couch for free Which is good because this couch has a bed in it.

141
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:49,860
Speaker 1: Yes, the couch also has many fond memories.

142
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:52,009
Speaker 2: It is also called the fucker.

143
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:54,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if we told that story on the show or not.

144
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:55,285
Speaker 2: We'll hold it off.

145
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:55,969
Speaker 1: We'll save that.

146
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,680
Speaker 1: Let's just someone put that in the thread.

147
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:01,712
Speaker 2: Yeah, remind Rem and Scott to talk about the couch named the fucker.

148
00:12:01,873 --> 00:12:04,160
Speaker 1: now, I will say the the story there.

149
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,480
Speaker 1: I won't tell the story but the couch almost killed us almost.

150
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:17,859
Speaker 1: In fact, if our friend Pete had not been there Scott and I would probably have died probably have died Under the weight of the evil couch, but I gotta say I mean our TV.

151
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,807
Speaker 1: I mean we're such geeks used to have.

152
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:23,681
Speaker 1: I mean, you know the old penny arcade comic about the guy who died behind the TV Cuz.

153
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,628
Speaker 1: there's so many wires.

154
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,140
Speaker 1: our TV was like that.

155
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,806
Speaker 1: I mean we had an intent the NES.

156
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:29,573
Speaker 1: we had the Atari.

157
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:31,500
Speaker 1: we had a VCR that barely worked.

158
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:32,579
Speaker 1: We didn't have a remote to it.

159
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:39,560
Speaker 1: We had the original DVD player which was an overheating region-free cracked apex with a case open so it wouldn't overheat.

160
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:40,512
Speaker 1: It was 40 bucks.

161
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,006
Speaker 1: Yeah We had the GameCube.

162
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:44,171
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had.

163
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:46,060
Speaker 1: we didn't have a computer hooked up to it at that time.

164
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,328
Speaker 1: No, we had the busted old TV.

165
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,095
Speaker 1: We had all those wires.

166
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,259
Speaker 1: We're really sure what they did.

167
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,806
Speaker 1: Yep, and we've.

168
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:55,699
Speaker 1: and we had the PlayStation one that didn't do anything or some play DDR.

169
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:04,127
Speaker 1: Yeah Now all we've got connected to our TV is a Mac Mini a Mac Mini and a GameCube and the GameCube We don't even really use so much right now.

170
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:05,996
Speaker 2: You know, we get a Wii that GameCube.

171
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:06,800
Speaker 2: We don't need it anymore.

172
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:07,924
Speaker 1: No, we don't the game.

173
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:08,807
Speaker 1: I'll probably keep it.

174
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:11,135
Speaker 1: But yeah, are we gonna sell it?

175
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:12,440
Speaker 2: - I don't know.

176
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,854
Speaker 2: But it'll go in the closet or something and then in like 30 years.

177
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:18,840
Speaker 2: I'll whip it out and people be like, holy shit.

178
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:24,750
Speaker 1: The hell is that I'd say oh we'll just bring it to conventions But we're bringing the frickin we to conventions.

179
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,700
Speaker 1: if we bring anything you damn, right?

180
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:27,843
Speaker 2: All right.

181
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:29,128
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you got a news.

182
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:29,550
Speaker 2: I do.

183
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,714
Speaker 1: is it video game related?

184
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:32,100
Speaker 2: It sure is outstanding.

185
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:34,979
Speaker 2: When did the Atari die?

186
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:43,847
Speaker 1: See, I know the answer to the hypothetical question or the rhetorical question because we already did pre-production But I'm gonna say in the 80s.

187
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:45,552
Speaker 2: Yeah sometime in the 80s.

188
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:48,221
Speaker 2: They just stopped making games to the Atari 2600.

189
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:48,905
Speaker 1: Here's what you say.

190
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:55,809
Speaker 2: Ah, but but just today Someone released a new game for the Atari 2600.

191
00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:02,229
Speaker 1: this game compared to the vast majority of Atari games looks bad Freaking ass now though.

192
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:05,281
Speaker 2: The thing is an Atari 2600.

193
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:10,880
Speaker 2: The games themselves could only be have so much memory like 4k or something like that.

194
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, now the NES were the same way and they got around it by a lot of trickery in the cartridge.

195
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:21,466
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, but someone made a What's it called?

196
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:29,030
Speaker 2: they made this cartridge have two 4k Memory chips in it and it switches between the two.

197
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:39,838
Speaker 2: so in bank in the second chip You have the intro to the game the intro screen and all the sound and in the first chip You have the actual game.

198
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:46,525
Speaker 2: So they put a game on one chip and they put fancy graphics for the intro and the music on The second chip.

199
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,113
Speaker 1: this game is real fancy.

200
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,222
Speaker 2: Yeah for an Atari game It's real fancy.

201
00:14:50,302 --> 00:14:54,133
Speaker 2: now the way the game works is first does the fancy intro screen.

202
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:57,723
Speaker 2: then it's sort of like What's the game?

203
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,509
Speaker 2: a night driver night driver?

204
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:01,295
Speaker 2: I was thinking Knight Rider night driver.

205
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:02,700
Speaker 1: I was really good at night driver.

206
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:09,300
Speaker 2: Yep, and you're this running Aztec guy trying to get up to the pyramid and you're in the desert.

207
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,332
Speaker 2: So you run towards the pyramid while dodging Spears and stuff.

208
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,639
Speaker 2: basically night driver with a running Aztec.

209
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:32,038
Speaker 2: Then when you get to the pyramid it switches to game number two where you have to climb the stairs of the pyramid without Getting pinned by various things like the evil priests dropping rocks on your head Sounds like a great game.

210
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:38,123
Speaker 2: And then when you when you get to the top of the pyramid you beat it and when you beat all the pyramids you get Some sort of ending.

211
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:38,905
Speaker 1: see now.

212
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:43,580
Speaker 1: It's really got nothing on kaboom, which is in my opinion one of the greatest games ever created.

213
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,585
Speaker 2: It's got nothing on pole position.

214
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:46,729
Speaker 2: forget kaboom.

215
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,860
Speaker 1: pole position was okay pole position - was much donkey Kong for the Atari.

216
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:51,945
Speaker 2: Actually was damn good.

217
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:52,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

218
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:53,049
Speaker 1: I've got it.

219
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,552
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

220
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:54,777
Speaker 2: What else was there?

221
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:58,371
Speaker 1: Oh combat Yeah, which you suck at you suck.

222
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:59,054
Speaker 2: I'm a great at God.

223
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:04,900
Speaker 2: what I kicked your ass the last time Last time sure, but ten times before that I'm going all of them.

224
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:06,569
Speaker 1: You've ever beaten me a combat.

225
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:07,956
Speaker 2: I've been you a combat many times.

226
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:11,879
Speaker 2: in fact I made a combat game for as a project in a class.

227
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:19,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, that has nothing to do with the argument in hand which is that you suck at combat and that the last time we played I wrote the program on combat.

228
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:24,693
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what I think after the show We're gonna whip that Atari out that Atari 7800 because I'm so leap.

229
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:26,540
Speaker 1: we're gonna have to play ourselves some combat.

230
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,085
Speaker 2: How are you gonna look it into the TV?

231
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:32,300
Speaker 1: I'm gonna plug it in through the little RF doohickey that I got all right.

232
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:33,238
Speaker 2: We'll see how that works.

233
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:35,619
Speaker 1: I got some ideas.

234
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:36,978
Speaker 2: We'll see.

235
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:51,897
Speaker 2: anyway, there's a new game for the Atari 2600 called a VCS tech challenge torrent, please All right, anyway that is the news.

Speaker 2: We have a segment on this show.

239
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:12,859
Speaker 1: every show called things of the day comes right after that music which Ironically, well not ironically but just interestingly is the only music we play during the episode.

240
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:17,762
Speaker 1: Due to the fact that I never bothered to finish writing any of it Awesome.

241
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,513
Speaker 2: Anyway, anyway the things of the day is.

242
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:27,400
Speaker 2: we talked about cool things We might have seen on the internet or other places and if you want to visit these things you can go to front row.

243
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,011
Speaker 2: Crew calm and in the show notes, there are links to the things of the day.

244
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:32,856
Speaker 1: They're usually worth visiting.

245
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:34,140
Speaker 1: They're often videos.

246
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:39,760
Speaker 2: Yes, if there is anything worth looking at on the internet today it is the thing of the day.

247
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:45,900
Speaker 1: It's been suggested that we make an RSS feed of the things of the day, which we just haven't bothered doing.

248
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:52,067
Speaker 2: Oh someone thought about see that might cause some Manual labor or a wordpress plug-in.

249
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:57,389
Speaker 1: Yeah something we'd have to do either some screen scraping or make the things of the day Special fields.

250
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,319
Speaker 1: instead you just type in them.

251
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,680
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'd have to make it a special field and then I'd have to write a little program to do it.

252
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:03,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're just.

253
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:04,920
Speaker 1: I mean we might do it in the future.

254
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:11,380
Speaker 1: But to those of you who suggested it be no let it be known that we've gotten your idea and we were considering it.

255
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:12,225
Speaker 2: Yeah, I never heard it.

256
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:13,273
Speaker 2: Who's who suggested that?

257
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:17,696
Speaker 1: I'd ever seen that before, you know I don't even remember but it was suggested months ago, and I just never thought about it.

258
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,580
Speaker 2: You never told me.

259
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,520
Speaker 1: I figured it was an obvious suggestion.

260
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,387
Speaker 2: Yeah, was it?

261
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:25,967
Speaker 2: obviously it wasn't Even to someone like me.

262
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,320
Speaker 1: All right, so my thing of the day.

263
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:35,480
Speaker 1: I was gonna do something else, but then Scott got his thing of the day and I couldn't pass up the thing of the day that he was passing up.

264
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,953
Speaker 1: So I'm taking it to save it from the obscurity.

265
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,400
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically I had a thing of the day.

266
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:42,413
Speaker 2: I found a better one, but the one I had was already good.

267
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:45,940
Speaker 1: So rim saved it Yep, and my thing of the day was alright.

268
00:18:46,202 --> 00:18:48,700
Speaker 1: I'll just use it some Tuesday years from now when I got nothing.

269
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:55,158
Speaker 2: I've got another thing of the day just waiting in line that I don't know if I can hold on to all right now.

270
00:18:56,161 --> 00:19:04,460
Speaker 1: I'm sure you all are familiar with crusty the clowns show on the Simpsons, you know a show within a show And I'm sure you are familiar with bozo the clown.

271
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:10,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, that kind of show, you know funny man kids in the audience kids get involved a little bit show a cartoon.

272
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:12,596
Speaker 2: yeah, a lot of you kids don't realize.

273
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:19,391
Speaker 2: but Back in the day before everyone had cable there were TV shows that were only on the air in certain areas.

274
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:30,067
Speaker 2: like there would be a local TV studio where they would make A show and everyone within a certain distance of that TV studio could pick it up on the air Kind of like a radio station occasionally.

275
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:34,700
Speaker 1: really big shows would be syndicated and they'd appear in like three or four cities.

276
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:41,711
Speaker 2: Yeah, what they would do is they would send the show to all the different, you know They would tape it send it to everyone and then they would all play it.

277
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:43,960
Speaker 1: now actually interesting trip our tidbit.

278
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:56,330
Speaker 1: They did that with unencrypted satellite transmissions back then because they never even expected that geeks would just buy Satellite dishes intercept it and get free.

279
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:58,075
Speaker 1: pay everything television.

280
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:04,454
Speaker 2: and back in the day people had Rich people had satellite dishes and they watched all kinds of crazy TV.

281
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:07,947
Speaker 2: and even today with a satellite dish You can watch all sorts of crazy things.

282
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,799
Speaker 2: that with your satellite dish without paying dish.

283
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,120
Speaker 2: network.

284
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, all sorts of fun international TV, but if you can portion of it is non English.

285
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:18,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's a world out there.

286

301
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,601

302
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:42,148
Speaker 2: and he's got an audience full of little kids going Koopa and some of them have Goomba hats and some of them have Koopa hats.

Speaker 1: And he's making fun of Mario and all sorts of fun stuff.

305
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,839
Speaker 2: I didn't actually see any making fun of Mario going on.

306
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:56,072
Speaker 1: I saw just because there were pictures from the screenshots of Pictures of the Mario Brothers behind him and the text he was like.

307
00:21:56,394 --> 00:21:57,800
Speaker 1: they talk about Mario the princess.

311
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,299
Speaker 1: I don't know Koopa Koopa.

Speaker 2: He's the king of the afternoon Koopa Koopa.

314
00:22:10,492 --> 00:22:14,644
Speaker 1: I Just think this is cool.

315
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:18,740
Speaker 1: I hope someone has archival footage and puts it all on the internet for everyone to see.

316
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,973
Speaker 2: Yeah, cuz right now we basically got the intro.

317
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:23,746
Speaker 2: I Have a theory about King Koopa though.

318
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:28,541
Speaker 2: Oh, I think I know who's in that King Koopa costume Mr.

319
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:29,002
Speaker 1: Belvedere.

320
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:32,090
Speaker 2: No, but that's a good guess captain Lou Albano.

321
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,414
Speaker 2: No, that's a bad guess.

322
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:40,490
Speaker 2: judging by the way this Koopa axe and The me the meager amount of footage I have of him.

323
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:51,122
Speaker 2: the only person that I know that would fit the That King Koopa would be Steve Ballmer Cuz.

324
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:55,460
Speaker 2: when he's going he's going like Koopa Koopa trying to get all the kids excited.

325
00:22:57,963 --> 00:22:59,479
Speaker 2: It's it matches it so well.

326
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:05,639

334
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:28,815

Speaker 2: So game spot has this hotspot podcast, which I listened to a few times, but whatever That was a Sony a fan of Sony who sent in an audio feedback to their little podcast radio show.

342
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:11,537
Speaker 1: the kid is definitely a fanboy, but One the fact that Sony's even pissed off the Sony fanboys is a bad sign.

343
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:12,360
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean think about it.

344
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,931
Speaker 2: This is a kid who loves Sony.

345
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:15,320
Speaker 2: he loves the PlayStation.

346
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:21,609
Speaker 2: He loves Sony stuff, you know If you were on a message board with him and you said Sony sucks He'd be like no Sony is to awesome.

347
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:26,854
Speaker 2: Nintendo and Microsoft are to poop But because Microsoft are number 10.

348
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:37,633
Speaker 2: Yeah, but look Sony if you look in the news of video game websites and magazines other than of course the official Sony stuff All you will see is bad news.

349
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:41,880
Speaker 2: He I mean he's crazy You know in his in his mannerisms.

350
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,207
Speaker 2: But what he's saying isn't far from the truth.

351
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:48,420
Speaker 2: all the news about the ps3 and the PSP is bad news.

352
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:51,978
Speaker 1: I mean, let's let's go chronologically through all the news that came out for the ps3.

353
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,979
Speaker 1: It the only good news was the first news which was there is going to be a ps3.

354
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,310
Speaker 2: There was also the news that it's going to be a region free.

355
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:04,000
Speaker 2: true true and it's gonna have Linux maybe.

356
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:08,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know those were good days and those days fell into utter chaos and ruin.

357
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,983
Speaker 2: everything else about the ps3 has been I mean, let's see.

358
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:17,792
Speaker 2: Oh and it's gonna be cheaper than a blu-ray player But that's that's bad news for blu-ray players, which is also Sony.

359
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:18,274
Speaker 1: Let's see.

360
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:18,876
Speaker 1: It was delayed.

361
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:20,120
Speaker 1: It was delayed.

362
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:21,810
Speaker 1: It was gonna be real expensive.

363
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,159
Speaker 1: It was delayed.

364
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,459
Speaker 1: The blu-ray was real expensive and not going so well.

365
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:28,003
Speaker 1: Then they have e3.

366
00:25:28,023 --> 00:25:44,272
Speaker 2: Oh No one clapped at their press release Even though that I think that's PSP news, but whatever doesn't matter.

367
00:25:44,312 --> 00:25:46,800
Speaker 1: That was the that was the highlight of Sony's e3 appearance.

368
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:53,238
Speaker 1: In addition to all that, you know PSP not doing well UMD discontinued, etc, etc.

369
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:57,359
Speaker 1: And then all those other tidbits start coming out.

370
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,550
Speaker 1: The games are gonna be expensive.

371
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,520
Speaker 2: the games are gonna be are hard to make.

372
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:12,639
Speaker 1: Now the worst part about the games being expensive is that the news was Yeah, our PlayStation 3 games are going to be more expensive than the industry average and I thought all right It's not a big deal.

373
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:19,320
Speaker 1: And then the numbers were thrown out and the number the high range of the number was a hundred dollars.

374
00:26:20,142 --> 00:26:22,007
Speaker 2: Now what game is gonna be $100?

375
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:25,737
Speaker 2: that has to be the best game ever made to be $100.

376
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:26,700
Speaker 1: Remember the Neo Geo?

377
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah that didn't do so.

378
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,692
Speaker 2: well no didn't?

379
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:39,340
Speaker 1: you can't sell games for that much money especially if your system is 600 goddamn snakes on a plane dollars.

380
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:54,980
Speaker 2: The point is is that Sony is just putting out bad news and bad news and bad news and they expect you know Sony people to just Be so attached to the brand somehow that you know, and some people are that it's true.

381
00:26:55,463 --> 00:27:02,799
Speaker 2: But it's such bad news that yes Even Sony fanboys will be broken and will go out and buy an Xbox or a Wii.

382
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:09,319
Speaker 1: I mean that would be like if we got pissed off enough at Nintendo to say something like that.

383
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,152
Speaker 2: Like imagine if the news about Nintendo is that we's gonna be a thousand dollars.

384
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:15,359
Speaker 2: the Wii controller doesn't really work.

385
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,304
Speaker 2: Mario's not gonna be on.

386
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:17,766
Speaker 2: the Wii.

387
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:19,150
Speaker 1: Mario's just continued.

388
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,278
Speaker 2: the weed isn't backward kavada with the GameCube anymore.

389
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:25,369
Speaker 2: No Wii games are gonna be a hundred bucks.

390
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,978
Speaker 2: We were just the Zelda game isn't gonna come out.

391
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:30,562
Speaker 2: It's like That's good.

392
00:27:30,602 --> 00:27:31,826
Speaker 2: It's that bad.

393
00:27:31,906 --> 00:27:35,997
Speaker 1: You'd get audio kind of like what that kid said only obviously much more a highbrow.

394
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:42,484
Speaker 2: Oh, of course Pokemon kids are so highbrow At least from us.

395
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:51,860
Speaker 1: No, maybe now see there's a visual gag in my head that I can't express in radio Where I cut to a penny arcade of Gabe just yelling the word fuck repeatedly.

396
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:55,129
Speaker 2: Yeah, I in about this fanboy though.

397
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,797
Speaker 2: I just love the reaction of the game spot guy.

398
00:27:57,817 --> 00:28:02,149
Speaker 1: He's like he's like They can't stop laughing.

399
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:02,953
Speaker 1: they're stifling it.

400
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:04,120
Speaker 1: you could hear him in the background like.

401
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,645
Speaker 2: It's absolutely fantastic.

402
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:12,397
Speaker 1: I didn't want to play the whole clip because obviously we jacked it from their podcast.

403
00:28:12,698 --> 00:28:14,624
Speaker 1: So Listen to this.

404
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:15,888
Speaker 1: It's linked everywhere.

405
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:17,373
Speaker 2: We linked to it in the thing of the day.

406
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:19,220
Speaker 2: There's a YTM ND for it.

407
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,979
Speaker 2: It's Sony fanboy dot YTM ND comm.

408
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:24,066
Speaker 2: You know what?

409
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:29,082
Speaker 2: This kid is definitely the man now dawg Alright.

410
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:34,080
Speaker 1: so we were at Kinetic on and we're going to cover Kinetic on in detail tomorrow.

411
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,898
Speaker 1: But because it's gaming day, we're going to cover the gaming at Kinetic on.

412
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:42,120
Speaker 2: Surprisingly the gaming at Kinetic on was high quality.

413
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:52,680
Speaker 1: Yes the board gaming euro gaming live-action gaming miniature gaming was Above average for conventions in general let alone a webcomic slash anime convention.

414
00:28:53,142 --> 00:29:07,796
Speaker 2: I mean if I compared it to ubercon, which is a gaming con Period you know, I could actually say it was a slight step up if not You know because they had about as many games in their library as ubercon.

415
00:29:07,957 --> 00:29:23,659
Speaker 2: Well the freeplay library Yeah, the freeplay library, but the room in which games are being played was much larger Dedicated only to gaming and gaming tables Had a lot of tables and a lot of air didn't smell bad and there were a lot of cool people in it.

416
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:25,926
Speaker 1: Yep, and we played a bunch of German.

417
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:30,220
Speaker 1: Well, I played one German board game and I played two German.

418
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:34,290
Speaker 2: well, I don't think age of steam is German but I Played two games.

419
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:48,494
Speaker 1: Yep But honestly while those are all good things as we'll talk about tomorrow the fact that they had so much space for the game room is Actually one of the indirect reasons why Connecticut leaves a little bit to be desired overall.

420
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:50,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll get into that tomorrow.

421
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:53,060
Speaker 1: So but it regardless of that the gaming was tight.

422
00:29:53,181 --> 00:29:57,403
Speaker 1: I mean they had a video game room that looked very typical of every gaming con I've ever gone to.

423
00:29:57,423 --> 00:29:59,230
Speaker 1: it had the same type of tournaments.

424
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,535
Speaker 1: It looked really popular.

425
00:30:00,555 --> 00:30:01,740
Speaker 1: It looked well run.

426
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:04,197
Speaker 1: I haven't heard any complaints from anyone about it.

427
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:11,180
Speaker 0: They had a miniatures room which I assume was running well because they saw a bunch of people in there playing miniatures games all day.

428
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:12,385
Speaker 0: Miniatures games go.

429
00:30:12,405 --> 00:30:20,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact that it reminded me that as much as I love miniatures That is a part of my life that is dead to me now and I seek never to return to those days.

430
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:30,477
Speaker 1: Yeah Battle tech is as far as we go Because I remember we walked past the miniatures room on our way to the board gaming room in the morning and there was a set of people in there playing miniatures games.

431
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:38,400
Speaker 1: I Walked back toward the gaming room much later that day like in way afternoon way possibly evening.

432
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:46,053
Speaker 1: Yes, like I think we I think we had just gotten back from dinner Yeah, and the same people were in the same chairs.

433
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:50,197
Speaker 1: The only things that had moved were the miniatures in the same game.

434
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,199
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's miniatures take a while.

435
00:30:53,823 --> 00:30:56,516
Speaker 0: But in the gaming room, they actually they had some.

436
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:57,380
Speaker 0: it's pretty cool.

437
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:03,772
Speaker 0: The way it worked is you could go up to the library the free game library Of course trading your badge and get any game

438
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:04,214
Speaker 2: you wanted

439
00:31:04,254 --> 00:31:05,200
Speaker 0: and play it with your friends

440
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:11,880
Speaker 1: Yep, and they had to a couple of guys running the Booth where you could get the games who were definitely Euro gamers and they knew their stuff.

441
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:18,939
Speaker 0: Yeah there was one guy who was in charge like he was staff in charge of the game room and he seemed to be cool and he knew what he was doing.

442
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:27,600
Speaker 0: he was going around teaching people games and Being friendly and recommending games to people and helping people set games up and all kinds of good stuff.

443
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:35,565
Speaker 0: he was definitely on top of things and what he would also do is he would go around to games that were being played and Give out prizes.

444
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:42,140
Speaker 0: now the way it seemed to work is He had they had this kinetic on money Which is just printed out money with a stamp on the back.

445
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,888
Speaker 1: they were bunny bucks because the mascot of kinetic on is an anthropomorphic rabbit.

446
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:50,420
Speaker 1: great and He would get wrong with anthropomorphic rivets, right?

447
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,683
Speaker 2: so he would give the winners.

448
00:31:51,703 --> 00:32:04,173
Speaker 2: you go to a game being played put a 10 bunny buck bill on the table a 5 and then some ones for all the other players, I think he gave out more ones of games were longer and That would.

449
00:32:04,193 --> 00:32:09,754
Speaker 2: the winner would get the big 10 and the second place guy would get five and everyone else would get a few ones Even if you lost.

450
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:12,930
Speaker 1: so you could use these bucks to buy prizes in the dealers.

451
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:22,590
Speaker 2: Yeah in the dealers room There was a prize Table and there are many things and they all cost a certain number of bunny bucks and I think it came out to our bunny Buck was worth around 50 cents.

452
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,510
Speaker 1: Now the really interesting thing is that systems like that are nothing new.

453
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:37,821
Speaker 1: They really only appear in Gaming cons and I was really surprised to see such a well executed system at a con that had gaming But it was definitely not a gaming con.

454
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:39,210
Speaker 1: It was a webcomic con.

455
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:43,343
Speaker 1: It is it is an anime con turned webcomic or vice versa.

456
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:45,570
Speaker 1: It is like an amalgamation of webcomics and anime.

457
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,136
Speaker 1: It is not a gaming con yet.

458
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:48,059
Speaker 1: The gaming was awesome.

459
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:54,864
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think really if you look at the con It's I have to say that it was definitely an anime webcomic gaming con.

460
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:57,233
Speaker 2: like a whole half of the building Was gaming.

461
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,790
Speaker 2: Yeah, so well at least the whole hallway, you know was gaming.

462
00:33:01,698 --> 00:33:06,404
Speaker 0: anyway We went to the gaming room and most of the games being played.

463
00:33:06,465 --> 00:33:07,590
Speaker 2: I think there was an apples to apples.

464
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,514
Speaker 2: It just didn't stop.

465
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:10,825
Speaker 1: Oh god, the people just coming in and out.

466
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:11,770
Speaker 1: It was there the whole day.

467
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:21,159
Speaker 2: Yeah, munchkin was being played very much in all its varieties munchkin foo super blender munchkin Regular munchkin super munchkin.

468
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:32,170
Speaker 1: we could tell that we've become a different kind of gamer Over the years in that because actually we hung out with the staff guys and the game We're gonna talk about today age of steam the main gist of today.

469
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:36,990
Speaker 1: We played with the like the two staff kind of guys at the staff table.

470
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:39,828
Speaker 1: so he had to keep stopping to you know deal with all the stuff.

471
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:44,229
Speaker 1: and Half the people who walked up were like, you know, give me that German game.

472
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:49,510
Speaker 1: But a lot of people were like, you know, I play trivial pursuit or munchkin.

473
00:33:50,952 --> 00:33:52,557
Speaker 1: You don't have monopoly or check.

474
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:56,510
Speaker 2: they had monopoly but they didn't have chess and a lot of people asked for chess.

475
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:02,612
Speaker 2: The German games were played just not as much as the other games, you know It seemed to be.

476
00:34:03,214 --> 00:34:05,021
Speaker 2: people kept coming back for munchkin.

477
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:05,964
Speaker 2: They kept coming back.

478
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:06,707
Speaker 2: They wanted chess.

479
00:34:06,747 --> 00:34:07,409
Speaker 2: They didn't have it.

480
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,842
Speaker 2: They played apples to apples constantly, you know those sorts of games.

481
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:14,010
Speaker 2: There's a lot of magic being played in the room.

482
00:34:14,695 --> 00:34:18,210
Speaker 2: There was a lot of other CCG's being played in the room.

483
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:21,150
Speaker 2: I think I think they had a closed-deck magic tournament at one point.

484
00:34:21,632 --> 00:34:30,384
Speaker 1: But all those people really stood out because the to us at least the German gamers the people who wanted the euro games We just walk up get the game walk away and sit down and play that fucker.

485
00:34:30,906 --> 00:34:31,649
Speaker 2: Yep, and the

486
00:34:33,192 --> 00:34:34,460
Speaker 0: It was funny because the second time

487
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,235
Speaker 2: we went to the gaming room the two I think I think these

488
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,179
Speaker 0: guys were volunteers

489
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,773
Speaker 2: actually the two guys sitting at the staff table Yep, they

490
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:42,475
Speaker 0: we went up and

491
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:46,987
Speaker 2: they were playing two-player carcass own and we were like, ah, no expansions weird

492
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:49,358
Speaker 0: and obviously Immediately, they knew that we

493
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,069
Speaker 2: were real gamers and they were real gamers.

494
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:55,083
Speaker 2: So they're like we can stop playing this and play something real and we want to.

495
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:56,309
Speaker 2: and I was like, yes, let's do that.

496
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,760
Speaker 1: Yep, and while I wanted to play Kayla's a lot.

497
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:00,407
Speaker 1: We I also wanted to play a game.

498
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:01,110
Speaker 1: I never played before.

499
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:08,472
Speaker 2: I really I most of all I wanted to play a game I never played before because a I paid a lot to get into the convention and that's how I'm gonna get my money's worth And be.

500
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:09,779
Speaker 2: I need something to talk about today.

501
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:10,402
Speaker 1: Also.

502
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:17,790
Speaker 1: I'm glad we picked a game that Absolutely insane because I wouldn't have wanted to have to play that game the first time on my own.

503
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,916
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'll get to age esteem.

504
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:20,544
Speaker 2: But first I want to talk a little about the game.

505
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:24,477
Speaker 2: I played Puerto Rico Early in the day with some other guys.

506
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:24,698
Speaker 1: Yep.

507
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:27,930
Speaker 1: This is when I slipped out to go to the uber webcomics panel.

508
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:32,230
Speaker 2: Yeah now early in the day I went in there and I was like in some guys like hey you wanna play Puerto Rico?

509
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:40,345
Speaker 2: So I'm like, yeah sure I'll play Puerto Rico with some people I never played with before and Originally, it was gonna be like me the head staff guy of the game room and three other people.

510
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:46,390
Speaker 2: but then some other You know con goers came around and I played with them and I taught.

511
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:48,499
Speaker 2: I think one of them knew how to play.

512
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:51,170
Speaker 2: one of them kind of knew how to play and the other ones are noobs.

513
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:55,134
Speaker 2: but I taught them how to play and Surprisingly enough.

514
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:55,979
Speaker 2: I don't know who it was.

515
00:35:56,019 --> 00:36:06,379
Speaker 2: I forget everyone's name, even though I asked One of the noobs like when I explained to him the rules He Absorbed every rule like a super sponge.

516
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,430
Speaker 2: He didn't ask really any questions, you know.

517
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:16,190
Speaker 2: And after I had completed, you know all the rules and when he played he played better than all the other people there.

518
00:36:16,995 --> 00:36:19,190
Speaker 1: Now things like that are very impressive to us.

519
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:29,970
Speaker 1: I mean are a lot of our friends are like that but that's because we're all very deeply mirrored in the board game culture When we run into a person who isn't a member of the front row crew who just picks a game up like that.

520
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:42,630
Speaker 2: That's amazing, especially a game like Puerto Rico where not only did he learn all the rules 100% from me telling him the rules once But he played the game better than some other guy who had played the game before.

521
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:45,806
Speaker 1: Of course Scott still won this game hand over fist.

522
00:36:46,128 --> 00:36:59,796
Speaker 1: Of course I still win this game hand over fist and in fact Being that I played Puerto Rico a jillion times if we had stayed for the whole weekend We had a racket planned where we would both play together in every game We could win.

523
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:08,797
Speaker 1: most of them get feel like first and second place all the time King make each other in order to put ourselves in first and second place You know, like kind of like drafting

524
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:10,263
Speaker 0: and get a mountain of bunny bucks

525
00:37:10,324 --> 00:37:15,639
Speaker 2: and then buy a board game with them Does getting our money back for the con?

526
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:18,270
Speaker 1: basically, yeah, but we're lazy.

527
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:21,061
Speaker 2: We were lazy and we had other things to do with the con.

528
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:23,350
Speaker 1: also stage esteem took over three hours.

529
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:30,177
Speaker 2: Yeah age of steam took a while, you know would have taken less time if the guys weren't busy doing their job But it's still.

530
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:31,610
Speaker 2: it would have taken a long time anyway.

531
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:42,021
Speaker 1: But I mean before we get on to age of steam Kinetic on if any of the staff or anyone are listening you guys did a fantastic job with your gaming and whoever was in charge Of that deserves some sort of commendation.

532
00:37:42,323 --> 00:37:43,228
Speaker 2: They should be the con chair.

533
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:52,127
Speaker 2: All right, so later in the day we came back to the gaming room and we played age of steam.

534
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:54,915
Speaker 1: now before We talk about age of steam.

535
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:57,966
Speaker 1: I want to talk about another game that we used to.

536
00:37:58,006 --> 00:37:59,070
Speaker 1: we played a couple times

537
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,652
Speaker 2: I think we talked

538
00:37:59,673 --> 00:38:00,255
Speaker 0: about on the show.

539
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:01,581
Speaker 1: Yeah called Java.

540
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:02,545
Speaker 0: Oh Java.

541
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:03,730
Speaker 2: I think it's my railroad tycoon.

542
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:05,149
Speaker 1: No, I want to talk about Java.

543
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:11,670
Speaker 1: Okay, because I think explaining the Java story which is a complete Java is the same as any other German action point game.

544
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:31,003
Speaker 1: Yeah but the thing is Java was the first game we played where the game seemed to be set up in a way to Action points with which to do actions on the board putting pieces of land down and The way every played the game once and tensions ran high.

545
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:36,327
Speaker 1: we came up with the following Fable as to we completely made up, you know, we made this up.

546
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:38,482
Speaker 1: It is a fable this is not what actually happened.

547
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:43,169
Speaker 1: as To how they determined the number of action points that you get on your turn.

548
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,502
Speaker 0: Obviously the real way that did it is it's some sort of math.

549
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,985
Speaker 1: Yes, though, honestly I wouldn't put it completely out of the realm that they did it our way.

550
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:52,882
Speaker 2: It's a hypothetical Possibility.

551
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:53,590
Speaker 1: All right.

552
00:38:53,671 --> 00:39:01,689
Speaker 1: So they get five Drunk German board gamers and they put them in a bar with the game and they give them 50 action points and tell them to Play the game.

553
00:39:02,532 --> 00:39:11,016
Speaker 1: Then they tell them to play it again and they give them 49 and again and they give them 48 and they keep going down Until a fistfight breaks out.

554
00:39:11,357 --> 00:39:13,885
Speaker 1: and the moment a fistfight breaks out

555
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:15,429
Speaker 2: you subtract one more action

556
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:16,896
Speaker 0: point And then you put the game

557
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:17,459
Speaker 2: out like that

558
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,510
Speaker 1: because the game was every round.

559
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:26,196
Speaker 1: I would do all my stuff and then I would just if I only had one more action point I could do it Every single round.

560
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:29,790
Speaker 1: it was the same thing and everyone was feeling it and the game just hurt.

561
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:41,010
Speaker 1: I love the game but that was our first experience with a game that did something like that a game where you didn't feel like you were progressing where Every time you did something good something bad happened to you.

562
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,080
Speaker 0: The age of steam is worse than that.

563
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:49,875
Speaker 1: age of steam is the most unforgiving Relentless kick your ass game I've ever laid eyes upon.

564
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:58,964
Speaker 0: now I'd known about age of steam because there are some guys at the local gaming group and Whenever we talked about railroad tycoon, they would say have you played age of steam.

565
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:00,410
Speaker 2: Are you playing age of steam?

566
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,468
Speaker 2: You know if you played age of steam.

567
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:03,799
Speaker 0: yet Do you want to play age of steam?

568
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:04,968
Speaker 0: and I was like they?

569
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:10,004
Speaker 0: Kind of gave me the impression that age of steam was the real man's railroad tycoon.

570
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:10,345
Speaker 1: Yep.

571
00:40:10,385 --> 00:40:12,735
Speaker 1: They'd say things like it's Unforgiving.

572
00:40:12,755 --> 00:40:14,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is no quarter.

573
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:20,670
Speaker 0: so in If you want to know about railroad tycoon, I think we did an episode on it, right?

574
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:21,953
Speaker 1: Yes, we did.

575
00:40:22,034 --> 00:40:25,390
Speaker 1: In fact, we did two episodes on it one of which we never uploaded.

576
00:40:25,582 --> 00:40:32,110
Speaker 0: Yeah So if you want to know about railroad tycoon Just go listen to our episode on it and it might give you a little insight as to age of steam.

577
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:34,699
Speaker 1: I will link to that episode at some point.

578
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:38,070
Speaker 1: Maybe not tonight, but tomorrow while I'm at work with no work to do.

579
00:40:38,832 --> 00:40:40,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'll add it in now, you know how I feel.

580
00:40:41,011 --> 00:40:41,294
Speaker 0: Anyway,

581
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,990
Speaker 2: of course, I'm doing work now But

582
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:51,359
Speaker 0: age of steam is basically actually railroad tycoon is very similar to age of steam because age of steam came first yes, but the point of it is that age of steam

583
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:52,344
Speaker 2: has a much smaller

584
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:53,047
Speaker 0: map than railroad

585
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:53,629
Speaker 2: tycoon and

586
00:40:54,690 --> 00:41:03,957
Speaker 0: there's much higher competition for the cubes as well as for the terrain and putting tracks down and It's also a fucker.

587
00:41:03,977 --> 00:41:06,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the mechanics are basically the same.

588
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,718
Speaker 1: You're shipping cubes around to get victory points.

589
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,050
Speaker 1: adding getting victory points also gets you more income.

590
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:15,904
Speaker 1: But the more income you get you start losing income in the long run.

591
00:41:16,385 --> 00:41:17,710
Speaker 1: You don't start with anything.

592
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:23,967
Speaker 1: you have to take out shares which you have to pay forever for the rest of the game and lose points for at the end in order to get all your money.

593
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:34,433
Speaker 1: and Other than I mean, it's the same game just really small really compact much more arbitrary and with far fewer Catch-up mechanisms.

594
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:35,195
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

595
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:38,783
Speaker 0: That's the real thing about age of steam that bothered me.

596
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:41,610
Speaker 0: Is that in in railroad tycoon?

597
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:49,272
Speaker 0: You're trying to get victory points and victory points you get when you ship cubes and you pretty much get victory points in railroad tycoon.

598
00:41:49,694 --> 00:41:56,981
Speaker 0: the same way you get income points in age of steam you ship a cube and If you ship a cube over three of your tracks you get three points.

599
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,601
Speaker 0: if someone else chips a cube over your track you get a point etc, etc.

600
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:14,889
Speaker 0: and In railroad tycoon you just keep getting points forever and ever and the more points you get your income goes up and up and up and then After a point you keep getting more points and your income goes down and down and down but you can still get more points in age of steam.

601
00:42:16,031 --> 00:42:18,079
Speaker 0: your points your most of your points.

602
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:31,369
Speaker 0: there are ways to get points besides income but every point of income you get at the end of the game is three points of score and As your income goes up it goes down.

603
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:38,270
Speaker 1: Yep, so like once you get past a certain point every round that you're past that point you lose two income permanently.

604
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:42,509
Speaker 1: If you get further on the victory point track, it's four then six.

605
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:46,405
Speaker 0: So if I have less than ten points of income, that's cool.

606
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:47,770
Speaker 0: I just get my income every turn.

607
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:48,675
Speaker 0: I think it was ten.

608
00:42:48,976 --> 00:42:49,600
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

609
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:51,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, ten was the line at least for the two.

610
00:42:51,832 --> 00:42:59,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, then like if I have let's say I have fifteen income points I get fifteen dollars and then my income is immediately put down to thirteen.

611
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:06,509
Speaker 1: So if you've been shipping a bunch of cubes and the cubes have dried up and you're up there It's gonna pull you all the way back down to ten over the course of turns.

612
00:43:06,971 --> 00:43:10,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you basically have to keep shipping cubes.

613
00:43:10,403 --> 00:43:16,605
Speaker 0: You have to keep the machine moving Enough to push you ahead and then it pulls you back.

614
00:43:16,645 --> 00:43:17,790
Speaker 0: So you had to do it again.

615
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:25,489
Speaker 0: You can't just like get a whole bunch of points then not do anything for a while while you set stuff up and relax And then get a bunch of points again.

616
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:37,644
Speaker 0: You have to make the game set up so that you're constantly getting more and more and more and more points Turn after turn after turn without slowing down like a giant snowball.

617
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:42,946
Speaker 0: if there's any pause in your snowball You're done because the game just pushes you back down the shitter.

618
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:53,974
Speaker 1: Yep Basically, this is a game where if you fuck up ever at all I mean not like in some games like Puerto Rico where if you screw up a little bit You still have a chance.

619
00:43:54,014 --> 00:43:56,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, you lose a few points, but other people can still fuck up.

620
00:43:57,086 --> 00:43:59,916
Speaker 1: if you fuck up in this game You you're done.

621
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:00,700
Speaker 1: You're out of the game.

622
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:09,049
Speaker 1: You might as well give up unless Everyone else fucks up worse because the earlier you fuck up the worse it fucks you.

623
00:44:09,954 --> 00:44:10,740
Speaker 1: Take that FCC.

624
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean think about it.

625
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,075
Speaker 0: If you take a share That's you know the way to.

626
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:19,810
Speaker 0: in railroad tycoon you can take a few shares at the beginning and not take any more ever.

627
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:24,290
Speaker 0: It's not hard to do that because you ship cubes you get your income up it stays up.

628
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:30,030
Speaker 0: You can sit around and collect income and then spend it and move on without taking more shares.

629
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,704
Speaker 0: But in age of steam you can't do that.

630
00:44:33,744 --> 00:44:34,689
Speaker 0: You need to keep moving.

631
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:41,714
Speaker 0: So if on a turn you didn't get a lot of income you had you know You had to upgrade your train to ship a cube You had to.

632
00:44:41,794 --> 00:44:43,218
Speaker 0: you know, you can't afford any tracks.

633
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,690
Speaker 0: You have to take another share now that you've taken another share.

634
00:44:47,192 --> 00:44:52,249
Speaker 0: It's even harder because the more shares you have the less income you actually receive.

635
00:44:52,269 --> 00:45:06,048
Speaker 0: and The thing is if you take a share and then you don't capitalize on each and every single share you take and Get that money and spend it in such a way that makes your income much much

636
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:06,470
Speaker 2: larger

637
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:10,370
Speaker 0: You're basically screwed because you can't get rid of the share.

638
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:14,189
Speaker 0: It's there until the end of the game and now you have to take another one.

639
00:45:14,531 --> 00:45:18,809
Speaker 1: Yep, now not only is the game set up to where once you fuck up you're basically done.

640
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:21,655
Speaker 1: if You screw up enough.

641
00:45:22,116 --> 00:45:26,670
Speaker 1: Not only can you will not win but you are eliminated from the goddamn game.

642
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:39,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, if your income can go below zero if you know you you get a bunch of shares you move up and then You know your income doesn't ever catch up to the number the cost of your training your shares.

643
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,330
Speaker 0: Well, you can't get rid of the shares or shrink your train.

644
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:44,216
Speaker 0: So you're losing money.

645
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:49,489
Speaker 0: every single turn your income goes down down down down down and if it goes below zero You're out.

646
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:56,776
Speaker 1: You're just done because for any money that you owe at the end of your turn for your expenses that you can't pay you lose One victory point which is one income.

647
00:45:57,077 --> 00:45:58,603
Speaker 0: Well, it's actually three victory points.

648
00:45:58,663 --> 00:46:02,929
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, three one income unit Mm-hmm, and it just kicks you out of the game.

649
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:08,355
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can be killed in this game and it really sucks Really sucks.

650
00:46:08,676 --> 00:46:10,787
Speaker 1: Yep, and the worst part of the game is that.

651
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:17,410
Speaker 1: well I guess the worst part in terms of how it beats the hell out of you is that You'd never feel like you're getting anywhere.

652
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:22,770
Speaker 1: You always feel like everything you do is just in vain no matter what you build.

653
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:25,579
Speaker 1: It feels like crap no matter what you do.

654
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:26,221
Speaker 1: It won't work.

655
00:46:26,442 --> 00:46:27,486
Speaker 1: No matter what you want to do.

656
00:46:27,566 --> 00:46:28,609
Speaker 1: Someone else out bids you.

657
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:40,270
Speaker 0: it's just imagine if you're playing a game against some other people right and You're trying to attack the other people and you know get ahead in the game yourself.

658
00:46:40,691 --> 00:46:51,121
Speaker 0: the problem is is that the game is like another player and he's constantly raping everyone in the ass and until Until you get the game out of your ass.

659
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:53,370
Speaker 0: You can't really do anything to anyone else.

660
00:46:54,012 --> 00:47:12,430
Speaker 0: so if someone else might have gotten the game out of their ass already because they know how this game works and If the game is still on you you basically give up because you can't go do anything to that guy And now that he doesn't have the game bothering him He can just get away and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it.

661
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,021
Speaker 0: so the winners keep winning and the losers keep losing.

662
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:15,302
Speaker 0: because

663
00:47:15,342 --> 00:47:29,450
Speaker 1: at least a lot of games like Puerto Rico or railroad tycoon, even if you're losing if you're in last place and there's nothing you can do to win There's a lot to do on your turn and it gets to the point where you may not be able to win.

664
00:47:29,871 --> 00:47:33,984
Speaker 1: But it's still fun to build railroad tracks and ship cubes and you're still.

665
00:47:34,044 --> 00:47:34,505
Speaker 1: you're keeping.

666
00:47:34,525 --> 00:47:35,910
Speaker 1: you're not falling further behind.

667
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:41,730
Speaker 0: You're still constantly accomplishing things and moving forward and moving forward at an increasing pace.

668
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:48,330
Speaker 0: Someone else might be doing it better than you But you're not falling back into the point where you can't do anything.

669
00:47:48,651 --> 00:47:53,210
Speaker 0: You're constantly going up and rarer tight in age of steam.

670
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:57,184
Speaker 0: You're constantly going down and only the winners are going up.

671
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:01,580
Speaker 0: and as the winners go up It becomes easier for them to move up even more.

672
00:48:02,102 --> 00:48:06,200
Speaker 0: and if you don't move up as fast as them It just becomes harder and harder to move up

673
00:48:06,602 --> 00:48:17,290
Speaker 1: which in and of itself is fine except that most really good games are set up so that The point at which a clear winner is determined is pretty much the point at which the game ends.

674
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:20,703
Speaker 0: I think that's why age of steam has a defined number of turns.

675
00:48:20,763 --> 00:48:26,610
Speaker 0: The game is X turns long the end Yep, as opposed to rarer tycoon, which goes until enough cubes have been shipped.

676
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:35,050
Speaker 1: The problem is that I mean honestly in the game we played the game was determined at the beginning of the third turn Yep, and the game was what five turns?

677
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:45,152
Speaker 1: Yep, in fact at the beginning of my round in the second term I made a mistake a very small mistake of a few monies and It was over.

678
00:48:45,453 --> 00:48:48,081
Speaker 1: from that point on there was nothing I could do to win.

679
00:48:48,442 --> 00:49:00,110
Speaker 1: not only that but there was nothing I could do To get cubes to ship to even do anything in the game other than take a bunch of shares The pay to do something which then just put me even further down.

680
00:49:01,413 --> 00:49:03,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, the game does have a saving grace in that.

681
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:12,965
Speaker 0: Theoretically if someone is getting real way far ahead They still have the difficult task of keeping that machine rolling.

682
00:49:12,985 --> 00:49:14,490
Speaker 0: Like I talked about the snowball before.

683
00:49:15,377 --> 00:49:26,302
Speaker 0: but the thing is is That you know sure there they might screw up while they're far ahead and you know If they stop their snowball at any point, they'll fall way back and everyone can catch up.

684
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:37,969
Speaker 0: But the reality is is If you get ahead of the game and you're actually getting money every turn fistfuls of money without taking shares You're pretty much You know.

685
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:46,390
Speaker 0: You can breathe a sigh of relief and just make moves to ship cubes without worrying and upgrade your train and do all kinds of stuff without war.

686
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:57,447
Speaker 0: I mean There was all kinds of times in the game where I just couldn't do things because they didn't have the money and it took me Until the fifth turn to really, you know, actually be getting a decent amount of income, but the game was over.

687
00:49:57,467 --> 00:49:59,333
Speaker 1: now Here's my beef with the game.

688
00:49:59,634 --> 00:50:02,344
Speaker 1: my main beef because I enjoyed the game.

689
00:50:02,364 --> 00:50:04,090
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'd spend much money on it.

690
00:50:04,692 --> 00:50:08,669
Speaker 1: I don't know of many of my friends who would ever want to play this game with me.

691
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:10,558
Speaker 0: No, I don't really know anyone either.

692
00:50:10,598 --> 00:50:11,663
Speaker 0: They just get pissed off.

693
00:50:11,804 --> 00:50:16,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, but because we didn't talk a lot about all the mechanics of the game that make it different.

694
00:50:17,006 --> 00:50:22,834
Speaker 1: because honestly Unless you know railroad tycoon and you're really into board gaming You probably don't care.

695
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:25,684
Speaker 1: and if you do care you probably already know all about this game.

696
00:50:25,765 --> 00:50:29,383
Speaker 0: and if you don't well email us Or go to board game geek this rules there.

697
00:50:29,403 --> 00:50:31,341
Speaker 0: Yeah this game It's just not.

698
00:50:31,727 --> 00:50:32,372
Speaker 0: you know Some games.

699
00:50:32,412 --> 00:50:34,820
Speaker 0: you want to explain how they work because it's interesting.

700
00:50:35,503 --> 00:50:37,490
Speaker 0: the way this game works is basically on your turn.

701
00:50:38,172 --> 00:50:39,416
Speaker 0: You buy some cubes.

702
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:43,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, my beef and I'll explain the game in a very abstract high-level way.

703
00:50:44,532 --> 00:50:48,384
Speaker 1: The game is a giant collection of extant information.

704
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:55,281
Speaker 1: There is so much information you have so many arbitrary decisions and The game starts as a clean slate.

705
00:50:55,864 --> 00:51:00,128
Speaker 1: the game is primarily Understand the math behind the game.

706
00:51:00,611 --> 00:51:17,515
Speaker 1: Understand while you're playing that one victory one income point is worth X dollars in this round but worth Y dollars in this turn and because of the statistics of dice rolling the odds are that this will happen and It's just a whole bunch of math.

707
00:51:17,836 --> 00:51:19,461
Speaker 1: It's a game that you could Scott Johnson.

708
00:51:19,983 --> 00:51:25,810
Speaker 1: Yeah now Scott Johnson a good friend of ours is the almighty god master of a game called acquire.

709
00:51:26,352 --> 00:51:32,794
Speaker 1: Because that is a game where if you sit there and calculate the odds of everything on the board and look at all the information Take it into account.

710
00:51:33,276 --> 00:51:36,290
Speaker 1: You can calculate fairly trivially the optimal move.

711
00:51:36,812 --> 00:51:41,390
Speaker 1: He was just really good at calculating that optimal move before anyone even though it took him forever.

712
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:45,710
Speaker 0: He would just sit there for like five minutes figuring out the best possible move and then he would take it.

713
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,229
Speaker 1: Of course if he played with us we just hit him.

714
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:58,987
Speaker 1: Yep, the thing is this game is a lot like that is that once you know the equations behind the game It's just a matter of who executes the optimal strategy for the current board the fastest and while.

715
00:51:59,027 --> 00:52:00,936
Speaker 1: that is a valid game And a good game.

716
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,630
Speaker 1: It's not a very fun game.

717
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:11,943
Speaker 0: No, the other thing is that you were used to playing games of tactics where you know in a game of Puerto Rico You can't sit down at the beginning of the game and say aha.

718
00:52:12,244 --> 00:52:13,530
Speaker 0: I see how this game is set up.

719
00:52:13,851 --> 00:52:22,410
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be all captain-y this time or I'm gonna be all this this time You know, you just kind of play it as it goes and you know, same thing with Tigris and Euphrates.

720
00:52:23,053 --> 00:52:30,450
Speaker 0: Sure, you can look at your starting six tiles and figure out your opening moves But you can't plan way out ahead in the game.

721
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:32,036
Speaker 0: What's what you're gonna do?

722
00:52:32,117 --> 00:52:33,261
Speaker 0: because you don't know.

723
00:52:33,301 --> 00:52:35,330
Speaker 0: there's so much information yet to be revealed.

724
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:42,649
Speaker 1: Yep, and while in a game like Tigris and Euphrates you can have a long-term strategy I do often like I'll think like I'm gonna build here and here.

725
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:54,615
Speaker 1: Well, my long-term goal is to put a monument over there somewhere or a monument attached to that Kingdom, you know Things like that, but if you make a strategy and then you have to deviate from it because of tactical considerations That's fine.

726
00:52:54,675 --> 00:53:04,825
Speaker 1: The game doesn't really punish you for that in age of steam if you Misstep at all at any point you were fucked if your strategy was wrong on the first turn.

727
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:05,186
Speaker 1: you're done.

728
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:06,670
Speaker 0: It's over an age of steam.

729
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:19,925
Speaker 0: 90% of the information in the game that is gonna be known is visible right away where the cubes start What cubes are going to show up in what cities and in fact nothing goes in what order.

730
00:53:20,085 --> 00:53:21,790
Speaker 1: nothing another player does is secret.

731
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:25,890
Speaker 1: Tigers and Euphrates has the thing that you don't know what other people have.

732
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,998
Speaker 1: You don't know what their assets are in this game.

733
00:53:29,298 --> 00:53:32,326
Speaker 1: You know what everyone's assets are no matter what.

734
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:33,990
Speaker 1: no one can hide anything.

735
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:43,190
Speaker 0: Yep, so, you know everything and you know most of it right at the beginning of the game Even though everyone's an equal footing, you know all the cubes and all their positions and that's what really matters.

736
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:52,585
Speaker 0: And what you have to do is you have to make a long-term strategy for the game Based on the starting positions of cubes so that you know, those are the cubes.

737
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:54,130
Speaker 0: I'm gonna ship on turn one.

738
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,355
Speaker 0: Those are the cubes.

739
00:53:55,395 --> 00:53:56,680
Speaker 0: I'm gonna ship on turn two.

740
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:58,930
Speaker 0: Those are the cubes are gonna ship on turn three.

741
00:53:59,393 --> 00:54:02,210
Speaker 0: I know I'll have this much money because you can figure all that stuff out.

742
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:09,627
Speaker 0: I'll take this many shares on this turn and then I'll have this much money and I'll ship those cubes and I'll get you know that much money from that.

743
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:20,122
Speaker 0: and You could just plan out your whole game on turn one and then whoever plans out the best game on turn one and then happens To execute that to the fullest is gonna be the winner.

744
00:54:20,544 --> 00:54:22,170
Speaker 0: you plan most of your game right away.

745
00:54:22,251 --> 00:54:31,250
Speaker 0: the only thing that can screw with you is If other players do things to interrupt your long-term plan of which cubes you're gonna ship on which turns.

746
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:41,180
Speaker 0: The thing is it's pretty obvious when someone can stop you and if someone spends Resources to stop you that doesn't also benefit them.

747
00:54:41,621 --> 00:54:44,510
Speaker 0: They're basically taking you and them out of the game together.

748
00:54:45,193 --> 00:54:48,169
Speaker 0: So you don't really expect something that crazy to happen.

749
00:54:49,215 --> 00:54:51,868
Speaker 1: Now I mentioned about the equations and the.

750
00:54:51,929 --> 00:54:56,686
Speaker 1: you know figuring out how everything works in the game what the value of things are like in Puerto Rico.

751
00:54:56,746 --> 00:55:03,590
Speaker 1: a good example is that Early in the game money is worth more than victory points and later in the game victory points are worth more than money.

752
00:55:04,253 --> 00:55:07,470
Speaker 1: But that's a very vague thing and you don't need to know.

753
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:12,769
Speaker 1: One money is worth two point nine six victory points on turn two.

754
00:55:13,392 --> 00:55:15,741
Speaker 1: Information like that is useless in a game of Puerto Rico.

755
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:20,843
Speaker 1: The generalities are far more useful Especially because the game is very cloudy in that situation.

756
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:26,070
Speaker 1: in this game You have to calculate down to the individual gold piece.

757
00:55:26,654 --> 00:55:32,501
Speaker 1: So anyone who's played the game before The more times you've played the game the more advantage you ever.

758
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:33,163
Speaker 1: people who haven't.

759
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,490
Speaker 1: now you have an advantage over people.

760
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:36,978
Speaker 1: It's like say Tigers and Euphrates.

761
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,070
Speaker 1: if I played the game a million times you played it once.

762
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:45,688
Speaker 1: I have an advantage over you because I played the game a lot but it's because I've learned strategies and techniques and I'm just I've become a better gamer.

763
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,067
Speaker 1: and After they play the game a few times, they'll catch up.

764
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:58,831
Speaker 1: But in this game the information itself not the tactics or the strategy But the information of how the game is constructed is the knowledge that makes you a better player Mm-hmm.

765
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,600
Speaker 1: Once you know the equation the game is much simpler.

766
00:56:02,021 --> 00:56:04,890
Speaker 1: and once everyone knows the equation the game goes much more smoothly.

767
00:56:05,414 --> 00:56:07,088
Speaker 1: But at the same point, why are you playing it?

768
00:56:08,051 --> 00:56:11,949
Speaker 0: it's like this really really hard math problem and you can solve it at the beginning.

769
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:30,348
Speaker 0: and if you know, you can't never get you know, the exact answer, but you can get real close and Sure, some other people trying to solve it might mess up your problem But for the most part, you know, wherever however far along you are on determining the answer You stay that far along the more you play.

770
00:56:30,931 --> 00:56:37,990
Speaker 0: So once you're real close to figuring out exactly everything you're basically real close to winning every damn time you play.

771
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:46,701
Speaker 1: Yep I mean playing the game with a different with one group of people and playing with the other group of people is in many ways Part of the same game because the information doesn't change.

772
00:56:47,143 --> 00:56:54,850
Speaker 0: Yep, but in the game like Puerto Rico At the start of the game everyone starts at zero and it's sort of like a race to see who can get the most.

773
00:56:55,072 --> 00:56:56,042
Speaker 0: Just go go go go go.

774
00:56:56,931 --> 00:57:04,434
Speaker 1: Yep, and also, you know, I mean both games have randomization but it's just the math and the Scott Johnson factor of this game are There.

775
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,487
Speaker 1: I mean I consider myself an extremely hardcore gamer.

776
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:17,290
Speaker 1: I Can't express to you the countless hours of my life I've spent playing German board games and Dungeons and Dragons and all the everything gaming gaming gaming.

777
00:57:18,076 --> 00:57:21,179
Speaker 1: This game is Too hardcore for me.

778
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:21,923
Speaker 1: I don't like it.

779
00:57:21,943 --> 00:57:25,639
Speaker 0: I Like how the game goes.

780
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:27,104
Speaker 0: I just don't like.

781
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:31,833
Speaker 0: it's not enjoyable unless It's like.

782
00:57:31,853 --> 00:57:37,730
Speaker 0: it's kind of like go, you know, you play go and it's you enjoy how the game works.

783
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:38,338
Speaker 0: at least I do.

784
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:49,728
Speaker 0: but the first like hundred or so times you play go you just lose horribly and You kind of have to beat the game before you can beat someone else.

785
00:57:49,748 --> 00:57:59,410
Speaker 0: and You know, it's like even though you're making progress in terms of getting somewhere in your mind You're not actually making any progress in the game itself.

786
00:58:00,092 --> 00:58:03,039
Speaker 1: I guess because I actually wanted to talk about this, but I forgot.

787
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:04,664
Speaker 1: we mentioned chess earlier.

788
00:58:04,704 --> 00:58:06,127
Speaker 1: now people kept wanting chess.

789
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,610
Speaker 1: I Really don't like chess and I was okay at it.

790
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:13,707
Speaker 1: I mean, I had a friend who was actually in high school who was actually a recognized master of chess.

791
00:58:13,747 --> 00:58:14,289
Speaker 1: He was very good.

792
00:58:15,152 --> 00:58:19,303
Speaker 1: Obviously, I'd never ever beat him at chess ever never even got close.

793
00:58:19,323 --> 00:58:37,174
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but I played a lot of chess and chess and this game have a lot in common to me in that You're playing against other people but not really you're playing against the game and a memorized series of strategies because chess is It.

794
00:58:37,537 --> 00:58:39,890
Speaker 1: it's a tactical game if you don't understand the game.

795
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,162
Speaker 1: but once you know the game and the more you learn it the more.

796
00:58:43,222 --> 00:58:54,290
Speaker 1: you memorize patterns of action and You just you know well if he does this and this and this then I do this and this and this but then he'll do this and this and This and it's just a game of figuring out the equation that leads to a checkmate.

797
00:58:54,852 --> 00:58:59,932
Speaker 1: This is just a game of figuring out an equation that leads to me having the most victory points at the end of the seventh Round.

798
00:59:00,213 --> 00:59:03,890
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm that one could say the same thing about all the other games though.

799
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:12,088
Speaker 1: Well now because the not so much because there's so little everything is so deterministic in this game and so open.

800
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:18,637
Speaker 1: and The fact that the game well when the game ends after seven rounds So the everything is very regimented.

801
00:59:18,918 --> 00:59:23,875
Speaker 1: the randomness is already right up front there and there's no way to Secret it away or avoid it.

802
00:59:24,598 --> 00:59:27,910
Speaker 1: and the fact that I think there's a very limited set of strategies.

803
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,930
Speaker 2: Yeah, there definitely seems to be a very limited set of strategies.

804
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:38,910
Speaker 2: It's like figure out where to build the tracks and in what order and on what turns in which cubes to ship when and how?

805
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:42,170
Speaker 2: Far and when on what turn to upgrade the train?

806
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:47,986
Speaker 1: I mean, it's very difficult to say in Tigris and Euphrates if he starts with a kingdom in that area.

807
00:59:48,026 --> 00:59:49,189
Speaker 1: He's probably going to win.

808
00:59:50,072 --> 00:59:56,429
Speaker 1: But in a game like this or chess is very easy to say if he enacts this series of things Then he will probably win.

809
00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:07,389
Speaker 2: You know days in a game like Tigris and Euphrates the starting board is always the same and you're competing against The hidden information of what tiles the other players have and the how the other players play the tiles.

810
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:18,904
Speaker 2: in Age of steam the board is set up differently every time but it's set up with a series of cubes and you could sit down All alone and figure out the best pot.

811
01:00:19,064 --> 01:00:31,139
Speaker 2: assuming there you were the only player you could figure out the best possible way and order of turns to lay track to get the most money and the most points and You're really playing against the game.

812
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,570
Speaker 2: Well, everyone else is playing against the game.

813
01:00:33,691 --> 01:00:38,095
Speaker 2: It just happens to be that you're all on the same board So some.

814
01:00:38,115 --> 01:00:41,329
Speaker 2: so sometimes you you know, you get in each other's way, but really not.

815
01:00:42,671 --> 01:00:44,177
Speaker 1: So that was our experience.

816
01:00:44,217 --> 01:00:48,193
Speaker 1: I mean he played Puerto Rico and age of steam at Connecticut Mm-hmm.

817
01:00:48,213 --> 01:00:50,887
Speaker 1: I didn't even actually play my DS other than pick to chat.

818
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:51,430
Speaker 1: Yeah me either.

819
01:00:51,551 --> 01:00:52,978
Speaker 2: I would have played a lot more games.

820
01:00:53,058 --> 01:00:59,527
Speaker 2: if I had been there for a day other than Saturday I'll probably would have played some Medici which is a bidding game.

821
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:03,599
Speaker 2: I really want to play Yeah, and some other stuff too, but oh well.

822
01:01:04,121 --> 01:01:04,281
Speaker 1: Yep.

823
01:01:04,321 --> 01:01:09,230
Speaker 1: Well, perhaps we'll go to Connecticut again someday, maybe Yeah, we'll talk about all that tomorrow.

824
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:21,770
Speaker 1: I think we're out for today because once again, we've got longer than we expected and that was geek nights with rim and Scott.
