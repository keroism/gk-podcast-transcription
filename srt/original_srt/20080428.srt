1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,792
Speaker 1: It's Monday April 28th.

2
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:12,677
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:19,319
Speaker 1: I'm Scott And this is geek knives tonight the three major desktop operating systems, and why we both love and hate them.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:32,598
Speaker 1: Well, we totally copped out last week.

6
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:44,757
Speaker 0: We did what two shows barely last week was pretty sad But I mean I got a new computer And I went out of town for the weekend like right after I sort of went out of town Far away.

7
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:58,070
Speaker 1: weekend before that we had that crazy thing in the city and The thing is it's funny because that weekend before last week We were thinking we were talking like man geek knives is really picking up like we're doing this radio things.

8
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,740
Speaker 1: We got all these like semi-professional things going on now.

9
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:01,784
Speaker 1: We're getting the big time.

10
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,210
Speaker 1: We're so professional now.

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, look how professional we are yeah, and then we totally cop out into a week of crap.

12
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:15,270
Speaker 0: That's all right because I think that after last week I'm sort of freshened, and I got some new ideas.

13
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:26,050
Speaker 0: I think we can you know tilt the show in a newer better direction because you know We've been doing the show pretty consistently, but I don't think we've improved it significantly in a while.

14
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:35,459
Speaker 1: But I think we hit a plateau where we got real good and to get beyond that we have to change something up and while I still want to put stuff in the experimental feed.

15
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:39,475
Speaker 1: That's like two steps beyond the kind of improvements I'm talking about right now.

16
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:41,403
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got some ideas.

17
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,693
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna be pretty good Yeah,

18
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:57,010
Speaker 1: but actually I had a good refreshing weekend too because last week It was kind of like we'd been drilling and drilling and drilling and forcing ourselves not to miss episodes and go go go 180 Miles an hour and we kind of burned out, and we had this weekend where I actually went to Rochester.

19
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,210
Speaker 1: You know the old alma mater for Toricon.

20
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:01,456
Speaker 1: I'll talk about the overview.

21
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:05,110
Speaker 1: Toricon is my news on Wednesday because it was a good con, but it's one day.

22
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,130
Speaker 1: I realized something sad.

23
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:23,000
Speaker 1: Remember way back when you get to college And then you realize suddenly that all the stereotypes of college kids that you thought were fake and no one would really live that way You'd kind of become when you realize you're sitting in class in your pajamas Unshaven after having pulled an all-nighter and eating ramen for breakfast.

24
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:24,324
Speaker 0: That's college.

25
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,256
Speaker 1: Well before I went to college I always thought that was BS.

26
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:31,357
Speaker 1: I was like no one's really like that and I got to college And I saw people like that.

27
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:33,750
Speaker 1: I was like that's totally like hipster bullshit.

28
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,139
Speaker 1: That's all affected, and then one day.

29
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,930
Speaker 1: It was like look what you've become rim.

30
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:47,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what as much as those college stereotypes are real saved by the bell not real Not even close man.

31
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:50,510
Speaker 1: if saved by the bell you think is maybe that's it.

32
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:53,206
Speaker 1: I was burned by saved by the bell when I was in elementary.

33
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:55,016
Speaker 1: like middle school I saw saved by the bell.

34
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:55,759
Speaker 1: I was like man.

35
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:57,488
Speaker 1: That's what high school is like.

36
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:02,076
Speaker 1: High school I was like wow Zach Morris lied to me.

37
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:09,590
Speaker 0: do you think maybe like the Japanese people have a similar thing like they watch all these high school Animes when they're in middle and elementary school, and it's like man?

38
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:17,288
Speaker 1: I think high school is like all the high school anime that it's robot and then I'm gonna get punched by a girl that I like, but they will fall in love.

39
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,196
Speaker 1: and But then I get to college and it's like.

40
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:22,282
Speaker 1: no all the stereotypes were true.

41
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:49,293
Speaker 1: in fact the reality is far more Stereotypical than the media would even begin to portray it as yep, but I really I hit another one of those stereotypes, so We we go to cons a lot, and you know we see these people who are more famous than us but not super famous or people who are legitimately mainstream famous and They always kind of show up late like stroll into the ops office like five minutes before their event like yeah I'm here.

42
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:49,979
Speaker 1: Where's my badge?

43
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,109
Speaker 1: give me some booze blah blah blah.

44
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:55,690
Speaker 1: And then they go into their panel half-assily, and then they leave like skip their next four panels.

45
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,633
Speaker 1: You know that sort of thing.

46
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:58,137
Speaker 0: yeah, I know those types.

47
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:08,230
Speaker 1: I had a one panel to do a torque on and I Showed up at torque on like five minutes before it was supposed to go.

48
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:09,838
Speaker 1: I kind of walked in.

49
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:11,084
Speaker 1: someone's like you got a badge.

50
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:11,989
Speaker 1: I was like do you know who I am?

51
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,578
Speaker 1: Where's the con chair?

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,342
Speaker 1: and then I went.

53
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:15,650
Speaker 1: I was like do I need a bad?

54
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,697
Speaker 1: She's like nah probably not.

55
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,450
Speaker 1: and then I went over to my panel room.

56
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,072
Speaker 1: I walk in.

57
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:25,261
Speaker 1: people are sitting there waiting, and I opened with yeah, so I totally just got here And I didn't plan anything for this.

58
00:04:25,503 --> 00:04:25,785
Speaker 1: Hi.

59
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:28,370
Speaker 1: I'm rim Dancing.

60
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:34,407
Speaker 1: actually the room was full alright, but it was the alumni room, but the thing is I know in 1829 room.

61
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:38,029
Speaker 1: Well the no I mean the alumni room.

62
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:41,990
Speaker 1: I don't know which one that is but I'm not gonna talk about all that on Wednesday.

63
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,780
Speaker 1: But I totally after I did my panel.

64
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,365
Speaker 1: I was like alright.

65
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,208
Speaker 1: That was great.

66
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:47,770
Speaker 1: See you guys.

67
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:49,902
Speaker 1: And then I kind of left the con.

68
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:50,588
Speaker 1: it didn't come back.

69
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,210
Speaker 0: So so hey how you supposed to review this con Wednesday if you didn't spend any time at it?

70
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:02,310
Speaker 1: I actually I asked them to send me kind of a synopsis press release And you know numbers and all that stuff, and I was there walking in walking out.

71
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,905
Speaker 1: I know how well the cotton you know you look at a con, and it's obvious this con succeeded.

72
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,089
Speaker 1: this con failed.

73
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:09,792
Speaker 0: Alright.

74
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:10,815
Speaker 1: torque on succeeded.

75
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:13,665
Speaker 0: well my new computer quite succeeded.

76
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:14,870
Speaker 0: with the awesome man.

77
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,884
Speaker 1: It's rare to see you excited about shit, but I got home from torque on.

78
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:20,450
Speaker 0: you know you want to touch my computer.

79
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:28,415
Speaker 1: I want to touch your computer like you wouldn't believe but you're not gonna cuz it's got password on it Physical passwords the most.

80
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:31,365
Speaker 1: I cannot think of something more trivial to break.

81
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:36,890
Speaker 1: but yet in all these years I don't think either one of us have ever even bothered thinking about hacking into each other's computers.

82
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:40,162
Speaker 0: No, it's like what we both use really good passwords.

83
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:42,490
Speaker 1: I mean I guess you don't need to know your password.

84
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,602
Speaker 1: I'm out your volume with a live CD.

85
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,570
Speaker 0: you could indeed do that, but you know what I'm gonna.

86
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:49,457
Speaker 0: I'm gonna turn on the bit locker encryption.

87
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:52,570
Speaker 1: bit locker encryption is pretty hot yeah, but you know what I'll do.

88
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,670
Speaker 1: I'll boot into Windows, and then I'm totally insecure, and you can just change my root password.

89
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:10,567
Speaker 1: Ellie I don't know if XP or Vista fix that but anyone out there you realize that with Windows anything XP or prior You can boot a floppy disk and just arbitrarily change anyone's password to anything.

90
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:13,239
Speaker 0: yep well Very soon.

91
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,270
Speaker 0: I have the powerful computer.

92
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:20,634
Speaker 0: It is running the windows, but I have the Linux going in the VMware And it's stupid.

93
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:29,561
Speaker 0: fast like I have a core to do at work, but it's a core to do a 64 6600. the cores are 1.8.

94
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:30,865
Speaker 0: Gigahertz and my one at work.

95
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:32,690
Speaker 0: right and it's pretty fast running Ubuntu.

96
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:38,681
Speaker 0: This one has two cores.

97
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:40,027
Speaker 0: there are three gigahertz.

98
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:54,855
Speaker 0: also It's 45 nanometer as opposed to 65 nanometer which means the transistors are 20 nanometers smaller than the transistors on the one I have at work man and 45 nanometer is Really small right?

99
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,949
Speaker 1: I remember when three digit and higher numbers were the hot shit, right?

100
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:05,230
Speaker 0: and In addition to that there's six megabytes of cache as opposed to like four.

101
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,239
Speaker 0: Um Yeah, it is stupid stupid fast.

102
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,101
Speaker 0: I think it's actually.

103
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:12,570
Speaker 0: I could have gotten a quad core for a similar price.

104
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:22,158
Speaker 0: I think it's actually faster than the quad core because the quad core would only be faster in situations where you were using multiple cores But actually most of the time your own.

105
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:25,769
Speaker 0: you know two is plenty yeah for the vast majority of shit.

106
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:33,150
Speaker 1: So fast I'll admit I just got a quad core at work a quad core Xeon like the quad core Xeon is is the cores are probably as fast.

107
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:40,527
Speaker 1: It's pretty much I got the best Computer that you can have on a desktop without spending like.

108
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,359
Speaker 1: like you know There's the amount of money you can spend to get something.

109
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:49,330
Speaker 1: and then beyond that it's like the I Commission a computer to be made for me by engineers.

110
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:54,084
Speaker 1: That's pretty much what I got but I don't need it like I don't even you.

111
00:07:54,144 --> 00:08:01,661
Speaker 0: I use one of those cars like a little bit yep, so yeah, um There's gonna be some videos soon video action.

112
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:04,429
Speaker 0: there's gonna be a lot more PC gaming action going on.

113
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,202
Speaker 0: There's gonna be all kinds of action real soon.

114
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:08,589
Speaker 0: You better better watch out.

115
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:14,990
Speaker 0: also I got to say is the first computer I've ever had where it's actually as fast as me like I push.

116
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:23,688
Speaker 0: That's the number one thing I hate about all computers I've ever used is that I can push buttons faster than the computer can do what I'm telling it to do.

117
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:33,241
Speaker 1: not always I couldn't do that on my Pentium 200 at first, but then applications got more complex and more powerful And then I couldn't do that anymore.

118
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:34,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, I started getting slowed down.

119
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:42,236
Speaker 0: I also I'm getting a lot faster than you know personally as you know like well because think about it It's real quick to type.

120
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:45,290
Speaker 1: You know the the command that would compile something.

121
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:48,220
Speaker 1: It's not real quick to get it compiled no,

122
00:08:48,521 --> 00:09:01,564
Speaker 0: but I mean like just with Firefox on most computers I'm like ctrl L and I start typing URL and Like I'll like hat it'll go and then it'll sort of type half the URL because I typed it too fast before the ctrl L registered.

123
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:02,332
Speaker 0: well the place.

124
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:09,476
Speaker 0: I'll push ctrl W the ctrl T like close the tab open a new one and then start typing URL and like it'll Start typing the URL.

125
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:13,136
Speaker 0: half of it will be in the tab that didn't close yet and half It will be in the new tab.

126
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:13,438
Speaker 0: man.

127
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,504
Speaker 1: You had a slow computer.

128
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:18,301
Speaker 0: Yeah That even happens at work though on the course you do it really.

129
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:20,410
Speaker 1: yeah, that doesn't even happen on my computer here.

130
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:27,635
Speaker 1: It happens to me a lot because I'm that has once when I realized that opened like my 15th Firefox tab.

131
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,729
Speaker 1: yeah, I hadn't closed Firefox in like a week.

132
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:31,016
Speaker 0: I just you know all like.

133
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:35,275
Speaker 0: but I do a lot of stuff like I'll do it like a Command to open a terminal hat.

134
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:43,593
Speaker 0: that SSH is into a machine type of command like switch with the keyboard to another window That's already running a command cancel that command started a new one And I'm just.

135
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,190
Speaker 0: you know I do a lot of stuff like that the other day.

136
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:49,470
Speaker 1: This is just kind of an aside, but I was gonna reboot my computer.

137
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:55,976
Speaker 1: So I had one like I was closing all my windows like shutting everything down kind of gracefully making sure I wasn't like logged in anywhere doing anything.

138
00:09:55,996 --> 00:10:03,259
Speaker 1: and I remember I pull open one terminal window in my ex windows thing and I'm like all right and I'm like root on some machine like some test box.

139
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,190
Speaker 1: so that exit and then obviously I'm not rude anymore.

140
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,866
Speaker 1: So I took exit again, but the terminal doesn't go away.

141
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:18,384
Speaker 1: now It's on some other computer, so I keep talking typing exit and over the course of like the previous two weeks I think I've been SSH into like eight computers.

142
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:19,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's nothing like that.

143
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,546
Speaker 1: I just I was like how deep did this go?

144
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:23,734
Speaker 0: just close nice You know.

145
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:34,109
Speaker 1: if you just close the terminal all the SSH connect I know, but because I was gonna type eggs a couple times and after it didn't close right away I was curious where I started and where I'd been.

146
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:39,130
Speaker 1: It was like what computer did I SSH into first and why?

147
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:43,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a computer that's as fast as me or faster than me.

148
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:45,630
Speaker 0: I'm able to like keep steam open all the time.

149
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,430
Speaker 0: I got iTunes in my room instead of having to VNC to the Mac and living room.

150
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:50,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the main I'm.

151
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:53,690
Speaker 0: actually I tried to sort my music collection, right?

152
00:10:54,112 --> 00:11:03,633
Speaker 0: I dragged a gigantic folder of music into the automatic sorting program and the limitation was the network speed of Contacting the.

153
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:07,786
Speaker 1: is this the same sorting application that would just crash on your old computer.

154
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:11,196
Speaker 1: Yes Wow Yes, isn't it great to have a fast computer?

155
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,219
Speaker 0: Oh, it's fantastic.

156
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,485
Speaker 0: Say let's let's make up some news here.

157
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,214
Speaker 0: So risers guilty That's my news.

158
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:17,716
Speaker 1: Okay.

159
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:19,564
Speaker 0: Do you know do you want to do it?

160
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:20,267
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

161
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:23,440
Speaker 0: No, I got a news All right, then why are you announcing my news before I do it?

162
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:24,063
Speaker 1: I'd fine.

163
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,827
Speaker 1: I didn't say anything.

164
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:25,550
Speaker 0: Okay, that's right.

165
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:27,806
Speaker 0: So this is guy named Hans riser.

166
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:28,370
Speaker 0: I think guilty.

167
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:37,959
Speaker 0: I think we've talked about this on the show once before if maybe more than one long story short developer for riser FS Which is a damn good file system.

168
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:43,490
Speaker 0: Basically this guy the only reason we're talking about this The guy is an open source software developer.

169
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:50,750
Speaker 0: All right, he sort of single-handedly or mostly single-handedly invented this file system, which is really good.

170
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,794
Speaker 0: It's a good high quality file system That's really innovative.

171
00:11:53,854 --> 00:11:57,169
Speaker 0: and the vert, you know, he's working on the fourth version of it.

172
00:11:57,471 --> 00:12:02,049
Speaker 0: And if you look at some of the working on it forever the riser 4 has been like this dream of mine, right?

173
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,167
Speaker 0: But riser for you look at some of the things that it can do like on paper and it's like it's.

174
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:12,110
Speaker 0: it's like it would Be revolutionary if it actually came to be in the way that it's written on paper.

175
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:17,087
Speaker 0: But it didn't come to be because Hans riser, you know, there are other people working on.

176
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:17,910
Speaker 0: I mean, it's open source.

177
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:25,565
Speaker 0: I mean if someone really wanted to they could go and get the open the code and just can carry on the project and Some people might be doing that but I'm not sure.

178
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:33,304
Speaker 0: but anyway Basically You know, he's an open-source developer but separate from that he murdered his wife.

179
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:36,296
Speaker 0: well according to this court He murdered his wife.

180
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:37,584
Speaker 0: So I guess it's safe to say he did.

181
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:43,284
Speaker 0: I guess it's not Slander if a court found him guilty of murdering his wife, which they did.

182
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:43,867
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't.

183
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:44,650
Speaker 1: it's not like the media.

184
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,550
Speaker 1: We don't know what we are the media, but we don't have to say allegedly anymore.

185
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:53,710
Speaker 1: We don't have to say Hans riser who allegedly murders his wife say Hans riser wife killer, right?

186
00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:00,698
Speaker 0: But the thing is right if you look into the facts of this case Alright, it is incredibly strange.

187
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,170
Speaker 0: It is like one of the strangest murder cases I've ever seen right?

188
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,830
Speaker 0: Well, I mean like there's all sorts of stuff like they can't find the body, right?

189
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,309
Speaker 0: They're claiming that the wife ran back to Russia with the kids to run away from him.

190
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:28,239
Speaker 0: there was some guy who his wife was cheating with and They were doing like weird fetishy stuff and there was like a car that was found with Blood on it somewhere and it was.

191
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:36,725
Speaker 1: there's a lot of weird shit going on with this case Like this is one of those someone meticulously murdered or meticulously framed someone else.

192
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:38,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, something is very strange.

193
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,078
Speaker 0: You know something illegal happened somewhere, right?

194
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:44,227
Speaker 0: It says you don't know what exactly and we still don't know what.

195
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,723
Speaker 0: but It's really, you know, this has been going on for a long time.

196
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:49,647
Speaker 0: And actually it was funny.

197
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,788
Speaker 0: a few weeks ago We were like, hey, did that ever?

198
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,313
Speaker 0: Conclude here.

199
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:56,545
Speaker 1: Actually, here's the Craig an example of the craziness.

200
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:57,910
Speaker 1: I'm pulling this from Wikipedia.

201
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,697
Speaker 1: I was just kind of looking cuz I remember some of the.

202
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:13,897
Speaker 1: I read that article months ago quotes Sean Sturgeon a one-time friend of riser and this is the guy who was supposedly Possibly sleeping with his wife and allegedly was an ex-lover of her Independently of all this confessed to killing eight other people.

203
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:16,805
Speaker 1: Yep, but claims that he didn't kill her.

204
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:16,885
Speaker 1: Yep.

205
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:32,160
Speaker 1: So What Wow imagine that if this is to be believed Riser knew a guy who was had slept with his wife at some point who independently of all this murdered eight people But yet didn't murder her.

206
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,869
Speaker 1: and yet he murdered her.

207
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:40,199
Speaker 0: It's really a fucked up case and the only reason you have any interest in it is because why riser?

208
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:52,770
Speaker 0: for the software this guy happened to make and you know To it, you know his disadvantage as good as he is I guess in making file systems Hans Riser like many nerdy type people as some social issues.

209
00:14:53,031 --> 00:15:03,260
Speaker 0: He's not really a likable He's kind of a weird guy and I think the reason that he was found guilty Despite they're basically not being much evidence in this case.

210
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,243
Speaker 0: I mean, there's no body.

211
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:07,756
Speaker 0: There's no there's no physical evidence There's no eyewitnesses.

212
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:08,720
Speaker 0: There's no nothing.

213
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:15,069
Speaker 0: All right, but he was found guilty From what I can tell because he didn't know when to shut up.

214
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:19,348
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean, I've heard a lot of rumors from a lot of people long before this.

215
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,530
Speaker 1: all You know murder trial happened that everyone said he was kind of an asshole to everyone.

216
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:32,803
Speaker 0: He's also sort of a you know, he's a weird guy and he Yeah, here it is a quote from the an article on wired which I'll link you to.

217
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:35,550
Speaker 0: this is this is Hans Riser's exact quote?

218
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:43,107
Speaker 0: Right, I have a compulsive tendency to say things that I know are true that people don't want to be true Huh?

219
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

220
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:47,302
Speaker 1: This is just craziness.

221
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:54,630
Speaker 1: I imagine one thing though I am sure during the jury selection One of the questions was do you know who Hans Riser is and or do you use Linux?

222
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:06,705
Speaker 0: Perhaps they just didn't let anyone with a neckbeard into the jury room Perhaps but this is if you're like if you like watching like, you know Or any sort of police detective e-court shows right?

223
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:08,170
Speaker 0: This is the real deal.

224
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,301
Speaker 0: This really happened right and it's way more interesting.

225
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:17,843
Speaker 0: You mean you can't write a story like this, you know And so you should definitely definitely look into it.

226
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:18,666
Speaker 0: Definitely.

227
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:25,517
Speaker 1: So in some Definite tech news IBM is definitely starting to push Lotus Notes again.

228
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:28,350
Speaker 0: What the fuck isn't it dead was less something updated that shit.

229
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:37,898
Speaker 1: Yesterday oh god see I. my first real job outside of college and actually was while I was still in college was IBM Was for IBM.

230
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:45,469
Speaker 1: I work at the MLC, you know I was a. I was technically a software engineer, but really I was like a support engineer the milk of them.

231
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,024
Speaker 1: But even more I was at the MLC systems like the 200 millimeter fab.

232
00:16:50,064 --> 00:16:51,810
Speaker 1: I worked at the place where they do hundred.

233
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:52,733
Speaker 0: I got a 45.

234
00:16:52,733 --> 00:17:00,889
Speaker 1: Um It's 200 millimeters and it's a circle.

235
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:09,530
Speaker 1: Next to it the 300 millimeter fab and let me tell you the 200 millimeter fab.

236
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:15,310
Speaker 0: But I had a bunch of wafers because we know the other 300 millimeter fab and you're making 45 nanometer chips.

237
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,970
Speaker 0: How many transistors could fit all the way across the wafer?

238
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,042
Speaker 1: That is a calculation that I'm not going to try to make right now.

239
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:27,329
Speaker 1: Let me put it this way I like to make you do math 300 millimeters is bigger than you're thinking right?

240
00:17:27,877 --> 00:17:28,629
Speaker 0: It's really big.

241
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:35,770
Speaker 1: Yeah and Like when we make these we'd cram like a hundred of them into this special kind of case and then they carry these cases around.

242
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:42,616
Speaker 0: And I remember one specific incident each wafer has got like a hundred More than a hundred chips on it.

243
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:46,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we're talking like PlayStation 3 cell chips right before they were announced.

244
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,470
Speaker 0: So these chips, you know one chip costs like hundreds of dollars at the store retail, right?

245
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:59,503
Speaker 0: You've got a wafer with hundreds of the chips on it And you got like a whole bunch of the wafers together in one spot.

246
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,107
Speaker 1: dude dropped one of these things.

247
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:06,470
Speaker 0: Oh, man That's like it's like you mean at least if you drop gold, it doesn't lose its value.

248
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:12,290
Speaker 1: But anyway, so at IBM we used Lotus Notes.

249
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:25,458
Speaker 1: Let me tell you Lotus Notes is pretty much functionally equivalent to you know, the exchange kind of Microsoft thing but the interface is Alien like if you've never used it.

250
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,790
Speaker 1: it is completely unlike any other program like that.

251
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,413
Speaker 0: So what does it do?

252
00:18:29,473 --> 00:18:30,899
Speaker 0: Is it do like instant messaging?

253
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:32,828
Speaker 1: It does everything that exchange does.

254
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:35,237
Speaker 1: so Exchange integrated.

255
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:36,421
Speaker 0: so it's an email server.

256
00:18:36,642 --> 00:18:37,866
Speaker 0: It's and it's a calendar.

257
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:41,013
Speaker 1: It's email calendar Messaging scheduling.

258
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:45,525
Speaker 1: you can build applications within it full database integration, whatever exchange.

259
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:46,648
Speaker 0: I don't think is that powerful.

260
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:47,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

261
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:47,556
Speaker 0: Yeah.

262
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:55,570
Speaker 1: Anyway, the only thing exchange doesn't have is like a very robust mechanism for building applications within.

263
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,499
Speaker 0: yeah That's what I was saying that exchange didn't have.

264
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,850
Speaker 1: but the rest of that you can integrate exchange with all these database.

265
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,130
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you can integrate his office communicator, which is actually really slick even though it doesn't support jabber at all.

266
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:09,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can always write all sorts like VB applications to make it do more things.

267
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:14,210
Speaker 1: But just the interface is alien and all the terminology is different.

268
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:22,110
Speaker 1: Like you don't synchronize your mailbox you synchronize your database because your mailbox is actually just a database and all this sorts of like.

269
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:34,243
Speaker 1: semantically, it's Unusable to someone who is familiar with any other email suite or office suite in the world Mm-hmm, but regard and you'd think oh, well, it's probably cheap or something.

270
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:38,140
Speaker 1: No, it was ludicrously expensive and Pretty much.

271
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,848
Speaker 1: No one used it.

272
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,336
Speaker 1: IBM and companies.

273
00:19:40,356 --> 00:19:43,150
Speaker 1: you've used it a long time ago and were afraid to stop.

274
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,224
Speaker 0: Well, I mean before exchange existed.

275
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:45,970
Speaker 0: that was the thing.

276
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,231
Speaker 0: I mean.

277
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:46,613
Speaker 0: what else?

278
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:47,880
Speaker 0: what else could you do besides?

279
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,850
Speaker 0: just you know normal like send mail?

280
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:57,570
Speaker 1: Well, the Microsoft mail solutions have been around for a long time And so if the Lotus ones they were kind of like these two competing like their office suite.

281
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:04,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything exchange and Outlook have been around for a long time, but not they're relatively new compared to Lotus notes.

282
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:13,940
Speaker 0: Lotus notes is from like you could get that shit on like IBM ps1s, but you know Let me get into Domino like the server for Lotus notes because I dealt with.

283
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,226
Speaker 0: oh so Domino is the Lotus node server.

284
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:18,797
Speaker 0: pretty much the same way Exchange is the outlook server.

285
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:20,224
Speaker 0: But any notes is outlook.

286
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:21,289
Speaker 0: Is that you're saying pretty much?

287
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:33,417
Speaker 1: Okay Anyway, the deal is they're pushing it and they've dropped the licensing costs to be compared to other enterprise solutions practically free and I don't know.

288
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:48,888
Speaker 1: I mean, I I don't think I ever talked about this but one of the big things IBM was doing when I was there and I actually was a big part of this and I I Got us off of Windows and off of OS 2 but in some areas and a lot of people were working really hard to kind of move to Linux and move toward the future.

289
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:57,090
Speaker 1: but There is actually a Linux client native for Lotus And a native Linux server.

290
00:20:57,171 --> 00:21:03,265
Speaker 1: those have been around for a while and IBM internally was using them for a long time as we were testing them or working out the kinks and all that.

291
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:09,967
Speaker 1: and there's also an OS 10 clients native and an OS 10 server if you're crazy Wow

292
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:10,789
Speaker 0: and

293
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:22,983
Speaker 1: What IBM is suddenly doing now is they're pushing this as a cheaper but still very functional Alternative to the Microsoft Outlook environment with the added benefit that you can

294
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:23,805
Speaker 0: write it in Linux.

295
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:35,200
Speaker 0: There definitely are You know some needed, you know competitors to exchange because I mean, you know for a business exchange is really where Scott and I are technical people.

296
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,050
Speaker 1: you think oh, we'll just run our own email.

297
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:43,070
Speaker 1: I don't think you understand how awful it is to run any email solution.

298
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,470
Speaker 0: I mean Google provides a pretty competitive product with the you know, the Google app.

299
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,649
Speaker 1: Oh, if I were a small business, I would use Google apps.

300
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,943
Speaker 0: But for a big business like IBM, you can't.

301
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,490
Speaker 0: Google apps sort of falls apart.

302
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,525
Speaker 0: It does not scale not at all.

303
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,910
Speaker 0: Maybe Google has their own like internal thing that they use that scales but they don't give that to other people.

304
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,710
Speaker 1: Plus small business you trust Google because you don't care large business or like where I work now.

305
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're IBM your emails, you don't Google reading those emails.

306
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:12,529
Speaker 0: You can't have that shit.

307
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:14,755
Speaker 0: That can't happen.

308
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:18,410
Speaker 0: So you definitely need to run your own servers with your own software on them.

309
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,970
Speaker 1: But I'm going to look more into this and actually what I want to do.

310
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,630
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to ask if anyone I know who works at IBM is still there.

311
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:39,629
Speaker 1: I'm gonna see if I can find that get some sort of press information about this because if the kind of promises are true and This works the way it's advertised and the licensing stays the way it is This is gonna be a big problem for Microsoft in the future.

312
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,710
Speaker 0: Maybe the thing is is that in that particular department is a lot of momentum.

313
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:51,703
Speaker 1: Yes, there is but at the same time There are a lot of relatively small companies that are up and coming and like kind of.

314
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:54,852
Speaker 1: now is the time to get our enterprise Shit together.

315
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:56,035
Speaker 1: What do we buy?

316
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:59,684
Speaker 1: and then IBM says well, look how cheap this is.

317
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:00,246
Speaker 0: Yep.

318
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:05,420
Speaker 0: The other thing though, is that Even though you know, it might you know, if your whole business uses.

319
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:06,344
Speaker 0: it might be okay.

320
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:09,478
Speaker 0: for inter business stuff It might be a little tricky.

321
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:11,609
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is for inner business stuff.

322
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:16,450
Speaker 1: The only problem is with the actual document writing and that sort of thing.

323
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:21,869
Speaker 1: But people have problems anyway, even if they're just using Microsoft stuff these days because of the incompatibilities.

324
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:25,130
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I mean, I don't I can't say much more about the details now.

325
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,350
Speaker 1: Well, I think this will go until I find out a lot more about it.

326
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:38,975
Speaker 1: We're it's gonna take some time, but I find this kind of interesting Things of the day.

327
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:42,147
Speaker 1: now typing of the dead is like the best typing thing ever.

328
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,279
Speaker 0: Ah Typing the dead is pretty good.

329
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,648
Speaker 0: But I actually I think Mario teaches typing.

330
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:50,676
Speaker 1: Where were you gonna play Mario?

331
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:53,286
Speaker 0: teachers typing on an old Mac l2c?

332
00:23:53,326 --> 00:24:01,450
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, this was on bb spot, which is one of those sites that died a long time ago, but for some reason it's still there.

333
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:02,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, go bb spot.

334
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:03,488
Speaker 1: I don't know goes to bb.

335
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,650
Speaker 0: So maybe one guy I think one guy does the whole thing and I think he's living off the ad revenue.

336
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:12,407
Speaker 1: So well, the thing is mean pool pretty much just died, but it's still there.

337
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:16,124
Speaker 1: but bb spot Continues to update and well bb spot is a lot more.

338
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,865
Speaker 0: they actually generate content Whereas mean pool is just linking.

339
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:32,730
Speaker 1: before Even when it was the hot shit I never once read anything on bb spot ever all I would ever read things on there and look in the upper left corner Where they have their five like things of the day?

340
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,500
Speaker 0: That's what I mostly did but I would occasionally read there.

341
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,604
Speaker 0: They had some content there.

342
00:24:37,704 --> 00:24:38,849
Speaker 0: Usually I didn't see it.

343
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,904
Speaker 0: weird It's like I wouldn't go to bb spot and read the content.

344
00:24:41,944 --> 00:24:46,789
Speaker 0: if I went to bb spot I would look at their you know links in the top left like there are ten links of the day.

345
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:54,570
Speaker 0: But occasionally some other site like slashdot or something would link to bb spots content directly like a like a funny block.

346
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,527
Speaker 0: You know parody blog post they made and then I would read it.

347
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:08,403
Speaker 1: See, but anyway bb spot more and more lately kind of like College Humor is becoming this almost useful thing Especially to find things of the day because dig is dead.

348
00:25:08,543 --> 00:25:17,161
Speaker 1: dig is just so useless now Like I haven't seen anything compelling on dig in weeks But right here from bb spot type racer.

349
00:25:17,702 --> 00:25:28,950
Speaker 1: all it is you race against other people typing Live in real time and it tells you your words per minute and it's really really fun and I can say pretty I'm happy.

350
00:25:29,372 --> 00:25:32,370
Speaker 1: I average about a hundred words a minute, which is a lot more than I expected.

351
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:37,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got like 70 but I was on my laptop and I you know, I was still trying to figure it out.

352
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:43,837
Speaker 0: I'm sure when I go and see the other room on my wicked fast computer that I'll be dominating But of course it was weird.

353
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:48,658
Speaker 0: It's like I fucked up like a bunch of times on my laptop keyboard And I I was going really slow.

354
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:50,670
Speaker 0: I still won every race I raced.

355
00:25:51,052 --> 00:26:11,048
Speaker 1: Well, I noticed though they have a recent high scores thing and like any web game I'm sure it's being gamed because the number 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 places out of 20 are all occupied by the same guy who is cheetah, which could be cheater.

356
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:16,470
Speaker 1: Aha also 205 words a minute not bloody likely.

357
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:18,907
Speaker 0: He's probably wrote in a little script.

358
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,678
Speaker 0: They wouldn't be hard to write a script and read.

359
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:26,013
Speaker 0: that's reading the screen and then typing it or he's maybe he's copying and pasting Or something.

360
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:28,286
Speaker 0: Maybe he's hacked the JavaScript probably something like that.

361
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:29,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

362
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,753
Speaker 1: I mean theoretically.

363
00:26:29,773 --> 00:26:31,619
Speaker 1: I guess that's possible but I don't know.

364
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,245
Speaker 1: I'm happy with a hundred words a minute.

365
00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:35,716
Speaker 0: a grease monkey script could Beat that game definitely.

366
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:37,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'd recommend you all try this out.

367
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:42,027
Speaker 1: It's a fairly neutral way kind of objective to find out how well you type.

368
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,051
Speaker 1: do it a couple times They.

369
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:47,330
Speaker 1: the cool thing is they make you type something and they make everyone who's racing type the same thing.

370
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:53,909
Speaker 1: So if you saw if it's something with a bunch of semicolons, at least you're all being kind of hampered in the same way.

371
00:26:54,503 --> 00:26:57,960
Speaker 1: but It tells you at the end what you were typing though.

372
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:00,230
Speaker 1: Most of the cases you should probably be able to tell.

373
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:04,510
Speaker 1: I mean I got the words to blow it in the wind by Bob Dylan at one point.

374
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,014
Speaker 1: I got someday lad.

375
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:07,137
Speaker 1: all this will be yours.

376
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:08,040
Speaker 1: What the cottons?

377
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,223
Speaker 1: No, not the cottons lad.

378
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:12,792
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got some Microsoft thing Aha.

379
00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:13,434
Speaker 1: Yep.

380
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:14,539
Speaker 1: So yeah, this is cool.

381
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,154
Speaker 1: And I want to hear your scores post them in the forum All right.

382
00:27:18,234 --> 00:27:21,269
Speaker 0: So so in I think in Albion, right?

383
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:31,050
Speaker 0: they Basically the Office of Government Commerce, which I assume is is that like our FTC or something?

384
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:36,264
Speaker 0: What they do right, but the Office of Government Commerce in in the London's right.

385
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:43,885
Speaker 0: they hired a design firm To make a new logo for them because their logo is not so good Scott didn't?

386
00:27:44,507 --> 00:27:48,262
Speaker 1: he told me about his news And he's like look at this logo and tell me what you see before.

387
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:49,990
Speaker 1: I saw it and I know what you're thinking right now.

388
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:52,136
Speaker 1: It's another unintentional goat see.

389
00:27:52,156 --> 00:27:52,919
Speaker 1: Yeah.

390
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,303
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

391
00:27:54,403 --> 00:27:56,690
Speaker 1: it is so much better than that, right?

392
00:27:56,771 --> 00:28:04,909
Speaker 0: So it cost them 14,000 pounds to have this logo designed and I guess they approved the design and they released the logo.

393
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:12,550
Speaker 0: and The logo is just the letters o G and C, but they're all like, you know, since those are circular kind of letters, right?

394
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,855
Speaker 0: They're all the same size.

395
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,562
Speaker 0: They're sort of touching each other.

396
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,049
Speaker 0: They're overlapping a bit.

397
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:23,110
Speaker 0: and You know there this is like this nice dark grayish color and it's you know, it's not too bad looking.

398
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,740
Speaker 0: Until you turn it on its side rotating it 90 degrees to the right then it is a laugh riot.

399
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:32,630
Speaker 1: So Scott, what does it resemble?

400
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,022
Speaker 0: Oh, I think people have to look at it to find out.

401
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:37,574
Speaker 0: if I tell them it won't be funny You you can kind of.

402
00:28:37,654 --> 00:28:40,222
Speaker 1: it's almost a spatial kind of like a brain test.

403
00:28:40,242 --> 00:28:40,422
Speaker 1: where.

404
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:42,870
Speaker 1: look at it without it being rotated for you.

405
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,976
Speaker 0: Yeah, just think about the letter teacher.

406
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:45,318
Speaker 0: either.

407
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:46,040
Speaker 0: do this right.

408
00:28:46,401 --> 00:28:53,570
Speaker 0: think of in your minds the letters o G and C But they're all exactly the same size, you know, perfect circles, right except o G and C, right?

409
00:28:54,971 --> 00:29:05,398
Speaker 0: And I'll put them so like the O is a little bit touching the G and that C is a little bit touching the G right and now rotate it to the right in your mind and Think about what that looks like.

410
00:29:05,438 --> 00:29:10,555
Speaker 0: and if you can figure it out without actually seeing it I don't think I would have figured it out I wouldn't have figured out without seeing it.

411
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:13,465
Speaker 0: but then you have some really good brain skills.

412
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:14,508
Speaker 1: use the form gyrus.

413
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:15,050
Speaker 1: Here we come.

414
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:17,547
Speaker 0: Yep, but I'm serious.

415
00:29:17,628 --> 00:29:17,930
Speaker 1: I lolled.

416
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, I definitely I said the word low.

417
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,170
Speaker 0: I lulled and I sent it to all the co-workers who also lulled.

418
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:30,942
Speaker 1: So, uh tonight, all right You were like, oh, I'll introduce the show.

419
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:31,485
Speaker 1: I got this.

420
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:32,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I forgot.

421
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,918
Speaker 0: I thought we could like stop and have.

422
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,967
Speaker 0: I've done a show in a while out of the groove.

423
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:37,694
Speaker 1: All right Well, I'll groove it up.

424
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:45,921
Speaker 0: No, but anyway when I bought my new computer recently, you know, there's sort of this dilemma of What computer do I buy?

425
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:54,110
Speaker 0: All right, and The Mac Pro as I discussed previously was tempting and the reason it was tempting despite my dislike of the OS X, right?

426
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,715
Speaker 0: I don't like super hate it I'm just like.

427
00:29:56,775 --> 00:30:01,690
Speaker 0: I don't like it as much as you know Fanboys, I just want to point out before you go any further think about this.

428
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:10,730
Speaker 1: We're at a point where if someone like Scott is going to buy a new computer effectively all Three major operating systems are viable choices.

429
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:14,020
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, the OS 9 day.

430
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,130
Speaker 0: Well, there are other operating systems, but they're not desktop operating system.

431
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:20,199
Speaker 1: I said the major three nothing else is used for.

432
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:31,770
Speaker 1: worthwhile to you, but back in like the Mac OS 9 days It was obvious for anyone technologicals like duh You get a Linux PC or a Windows PC and you just discounted the Mac.

433
00:30:32,072 --> 00:30:36,937
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then before that you've obviously Discounted Linux because it was awful.

434
00:30:36,957 --> 00:30:40,186
Speaker 0: I mean there was a time where it was just Windows.

435
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:41,430
Speaker 0: There is nothing else.

436
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:45,142
Speaker 1: Actually back then I think Mac was a valid competitor.

437
00:30:45,182 --> 00:30:51,755
Speaker 0: because no no, no, we're talking like 1995 through like 2001.

438
00:30:51,755 --> 00:30:56,017
Speaker 1: and remember there was pretty much 95 through 2001.

439
00:30:56,017 --> 00:31:01,998
Speaker 0: it was pretty much just like wind held even before 95 I'd say 93 through oh one.

440
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:04,006
Speaker 0: it was pretty much windows all the way.

441
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:19,109
Speaker 0: and then oh 2001 is when Linux actually sort of became usable and then OS X came out when I don't know and that's whatever the Though SX came out is when the Mac started to get a little bit better but anyway.

442
00:31:19,953 --> 00:31:26,370
Speaker 0: So it was kind of tough and to decide what I was gonna get mostly because you know I was like Linux would be the obvious answer.

443
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:37,610
Speaker 0: But the thing is I already had a Linux PC, right and I have a Linux laptop So I can already do all the stuff Linux does and if I was just gonna stick with Linux I would didn't need to buy a new computer.

444
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:47,788
Speaker 0: The reason I was buying a new computer is because I wanted to do some video editing which Linux didn't really have so much but it was Windows or Mac and it was a tough choice.

445
00:31:47,808 --> 00:32:00,287
Speaker 0: and We sort of realized like what rim said there are three OS is now and it's a good and a bad thing and that each OS is really good at some things and really bad at some other things.

446
00:32:00,307 --> 00:32:02,915
Speaker 0: and but none of them are perfect.

447
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:11,168
Speaker 0: and that is why the Mac Pro was so tempting despite its insane cost is because it was the Only computer capable of running all three OS is at once.

448
00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:11,590
Speaker 0: plus.

449
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:14,908
Speaker 1: There is the side effect that if you buy a Mac product.

450
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:17,357
Speaker 1: What you do get is the industrial design.

451
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:27,047
Speaker 1: the fact that like our Mac mini downstairs to fight despite all its failings is In the end super great because it's completely silent and looks super good on our TV.

452
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:34,167
Speaker 0: It's really tiny But anyway, so yeah first I want to talk about like a little bit what a what an operating system actually

453
00:32:34,308 --> 00:32:35,271
Speaker 1: real briefly Yeah,

454
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:40,609
Speaker 0: real briefly and then we'll just discuss what the how did I guess sort of how to pick which one is right for you?

455
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:56,496
Speaker 0: Okay, so an operating system right back in the olden days Right, like we're talking Apple 2 and previous days, you know You'd buy a computer and all the software for that computer ran Directly on the computer.

456
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:06,590
Speaker 0: so like Oregon Trail for the Apple 2 doesn't run on some Apple OS Right, it talks directly to the chips in the Apple - right it directly.

457
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:09,299
Speaker 0: So you put that floppy disk in there.

458
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,310
Speaker 0: the computer boots off of the Oregon Trail floppy.

459
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:29,509
Speaker 0: Now the thing is that means that when you want to write a game like Oregon Trail You have to understand the hardware in the machine And if you want to run that Oregon Trail on a different piece of hardware You have to completely rewrite the Oregon Trail a whole over again.

460
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:34,790
Speaker 0: Basically, the chip was the operating system really back in those days and it sucked.

461
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:38,570
Speaker 0: So they invented the operating system, right?

462
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:53,981
Speaker 0: Well, the operating system was actually invented a long time before that but you know It wasn't really big on the home PCs until you know like the DOS Windows Mac days which are a little bit later than the Apple - and Basically when operating system is it's just a piece of software.

463
00:33:54,502 --> 00:33:57,190
Speaker 0: and that piece of software talks to the hardware.

464
00:33:57,672 --> 00:34:00,562
Speaker 1: Right, and then I thought we were gonna be brief here.

465
00:34:00,642 --> 00:34:01,244
Speaker 0: I am brief.

466
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:13,839
Speaker 0: all the other software talks to the operating system, so You put an operating system and the only people in the world who have to worry about Talking to hardware are people who make operating systems.

467
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:30,300
Speaker 0: and then when you write a piece of software like a game or word processor You only have to learn how to talk to the operating system thus Allowing software to run on a lot more different hardwares as opposed to okay only this one specific Machine can run Microsoft Word.

468
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,730
Speaker 0: No pretty much any machine can run Microsoft Word.

469
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:42,202
Speaker 0: So the question then becomes right since you have you know You have a machine and you need an operating system to go on it.

470
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,510
Speaker 0: How do you pick which one?

471
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:45,254
Speaker 0: You know what it.

472
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:46,058
Speaker 0: what is the difference?

473
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:46,762
Speaker 0: why even bother?

474
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:48,230
Speaker 0: why not just pick whichever one works?

475
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,530
Speaker 1: Well, the thing that kind of annoys me is that you know, I use all three op.

476
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,210
Speaker 1: In fact right now, I've got my Linux box in front of me and that's what I'm recording geek nights on.

477
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:07,802
Speaker 1: I'm currently typing up our post and going through my email and all this stuff while I'm talking and right next to me also is my laptop running Windows Vista and Both of them do their jobs and then right downstairs.

478
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:21,599
Speaker 1: I got the Mac with OS 10 and Every single one of them does something that the other two can't do and At the same time every single one of them annoys me in a different way to the point that I feel like they're all equally Useful and equally useless.

479
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,182
Speaker 0: Yes.

480
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:23,348
Speaker 0: I agree entirely.

481
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:31,130
Speaker 1: basically I mean, well don't OS 10 annoys me because things are opaque and if it breaks I can't fix it because it doesn't tell me what's wrong.

482
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:41,261
Speaker 1: and when I right-click on things the context always change and the cut context changing bothers me more than anything, but When the OS does work, it's great.

483
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:42,606
Speaker 1: It's super pretty.

484
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:43,790
Speaker 1: It's super slick.

485
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:47,161
Speaker 1: The applications on it like adm are amazing.

486
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:51,450
Speaker 0: Well adm isn't a part of OS X But you can't run it on anything else.

487
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:56,690
Speaker 0: Actually, I like in Digsby now that that's my new thing.

488
00:35:57,595 --> 00:35:58,721
Speaker 0: I don't need adm anymore.

489
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:00,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I'm leery about Digsby.

490
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:00,711
Speaker 1: Is that?

491
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:05,209
Speaker 1: why are they advertising with very very expensive advertisements all over New York City?

492
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,415
Speaker 0: Digsby yeah, really?

493
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:08,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, huh?

494
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:09,601
Speaker 0: I didn't see any.

495
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:11,746
Speaker 1: they're all over midtown.

496
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:16,460
Speaker 1: really I have to look for I wonder why I'm curious about where this project is going.

497
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,423
Speaker 0: Oh, it's just an.

498
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:18,687
Speaker 0: I am client and it works.

499
00:36:18,888 --> 00:36:26,293
Speaker 0: So hey but anyway, see at the read that basically the difference between the OS is right is one.

500
00:36:26,714 --> 00:36:28,541
Speaker 0: how do they talk to the hardware?

501
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,469
Speaker 0: All right, and what hardware can they talk to?

502
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:33,818
Speaker 0: and What software is for the OS is?

503
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:35,123
Speaker 0: that's really the big one, right?

504
00:36:35,164 --> 00:36:36,730
Speaker 1: Well, there's also you know user interface.

505
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,921
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is right is that user interface is really.

506
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:48,430
Speaker 0: I mean nowadays people sort of you know Identify the operating system by the user interface, but user interface really is a separate thing.

507
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,514
Speaker 0: It just so happens.

508
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:52,607
Speaker 1: Well that but that because of that it just so happens.

509
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,604
Speaker 1: you're about to say Effectively, they are intertwined at least with OS X and Windows.

510
00:36:56,644 --> 00:36:58,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't readily change.

511
00:36:58,695 --> 00:37:00,950
Speaker 0: Well, you can you can go and download different shells.

512
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,573
Speaker 0: No, switch it up.

513
00:37:01,613 --> 00:37:02,899
Speaker 1: not for normal people.

514
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:05,430
Speaker 1: The average person doesn't know how doesn't even know they can.

515
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:06,433
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't.

516
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:11,823
Speaker 1: I think we should really avoid the technical stuff and talk about just the reality of if you just boot Windows and use it.

517
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:18,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you just move windows and use you get the windows user interface and you can change it But you can't change it that much.

518
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:26,338
Speaker 1: The thing is Windows actually has a lot of intelligent defaults and for an average person if you just boot windows It'll do everything you want.

519
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:39,990
Speaker 0: I think for an average person Ubuntu Linux at least right or mo actually the major Linux desktop Distributions with any windows or Mac will all just work for an average normal person.

520
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,976
Speaker 1: Well redhead doesn't so much.

521
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,100
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, actually.

522
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,290
Speaker 1: No, I just got a brand new redhead enterprise file.

523
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,018
Speaker 0: That's right at enterprise fedora will just kind of work.

524
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:50,602
Speaker 1: No fedora.

525
00:37:50,783 --> 00:37:52,307
Speaker 0: Hey, when's the last time you used it?

526
00:37:52,668 --> 00:37:53,370
Speaker 1: like a week ago?

527
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:54,419
Speaker 1: I have a fedora box.

528
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:55,488
Speaker 0: What was wrong with it?

529
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:59,050
Speaker 1: If you just boot a brand new fedora box and you start using it, it's fine.

530
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:07,252
Speaker 1: but then if you try to do some basic things like go and change your screen resolution a lot of times a lot of those Things just don't work Really?

531
00:38:07,313 --> 00:38:09,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, so and right at enterprise right.

532
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:11,465
Speaker 1: five the newest newest thing.

533
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:12,970
Speaker 1: we install it all good.

534
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:19,210
Speaker 1: It's got a good Nvidia video card in the proprietary drivers come already installed because you know, it's this integrated.

535
00:38:19,532 --> 00:38:21,906
Speaker 1: We bought a real Linux box tested and working.

536
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:22,369
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

537
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:28,110
Speaker 1: So I go alright and I open the Nvidia settings thing and I go to change my screen resolution and it says, okay.

538
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:31,401
Speaker 1: And then it says do you want to save this your X config?

539
00:38:31,783 --> 00:38:33,950
Speaker 1: if you say no then when you reboot everything gets?

540
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,393
Speaker 1: Reset to the defaults.

541
00:38:36,035 --> 00:38:40,310
Speaker 1: if you say yes, it fails because you don't have the rights to the X configuration file.

542
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:41,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have to run.

543
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:43,059
Speaker 0: the Nvidia setting thing is root.

544
00:38:43,761 --> 00:38:48,617
Speaker 1: Yes to announce to someone who sits down like alright This is my new computer and isn't super technical.

545
00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:50,102
Speaker 1: That's already a deal breaker.

546
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,667
Speaker 0: I guess that is true.

547
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:53,996
Speaker 1: every other Configurator thing.

548
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:59,304
Speaker 1: if you're not root and you try to run it It prompts you for the root password or for your password or for whatever.

549
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:02,039
Speaker 1: but for the Nvidia thing No, it doesn't.

550
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,569
Speaker 0: Well buntu doesn't have that problem

551
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:18,870
Speaker 1: I know but right at enterprise and fedora do and even worse The only way to make it work is to add yourself to the wheel group and then use VI Sudu and edit the suit oars file to give yourself permission to do it and then run it as roots.

552
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:21,120
Speaker 0: Can't just use like gksu.

553
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:24,958
Speaker 1: that doesn't come with it by default It's not in there.

554
00:39:24,978 --> 00:39:25,903
Speaker 0: I was like duh.

555
00:39:26,224 --> 00:39:37,770
Speaker 0: Alright, gk sudha You know me Red Hat recently had a story that was all over the nets Like we're giving up on the desktop and people were like, uh, didn't you give up on the desktop when you split fedora off?

556
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,651
Speaker 0: Like years ago.

557
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:51,161
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're marketing read at enterprise workstation as the enterprise desktop Linux and it's not A thousand times better and a lot more robust.

558
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:53,409
Speaker 0: How could they not be convinced as soon as they boot it up?

559
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:57,909
Speaker 1: Mostly it has to do with the fact that you know support and that sort of thing.

560
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,666
Speaker 0: Plus you can pay Canonical for support just like you pay Red Hat for support.

561
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:02,430
Speaker 1: It's not the same.

562
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:05,759
Speaker 0: Anyway, so what are the?

563
00:40:05,939 --> 00:40:08,490
Speaker 0: what is the real decisions between the OS is here, right?

564
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:15,470
Speaker 0: Okay, OS X good things about OS X content creation content creation tools up the wazoo.

565
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,624
Speaker 0: Not only do you have the Adobe suite you have all the Apple stuff.

566
00:40:18,945 --> 00:40:20,050
Speaker 0: You got the Pro Tools.

567
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:26,150
Speaker 0: You got everything all the content creation stuff works right and all the other content creation people use it.

568
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:27,608
Speaker 0: So it's all up in the business.

569
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:37,333
Speaker 0: You the heart it just it comes with the hardware so you don't have to worry about installing OS is or anything Tricky like that.

570
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:38,657
Speaker 0: It just works.

571
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:43,230
Speaker 0: and you know, the the hardware expects that one operating system.

572
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:52,310
Speaker 0: So, you know the the fact that everything's all integrated like that really all anything low-level that if you don't want to deal with it You're never gonna have to deal with it ever.

573
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,626
Speaker 0: and it looks really nice.

574
00:40:54,646 --> 00:40:59,300
Speaker 0: and What else is so great about OS X?

575
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,246
Speaker 1: that's pretty much it.

576
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:01,010
Speaker 0: that's pretty much it.

577
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,810
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean, it's really pretty and slick and that actually does count for something.

578
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:11,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also for develop, you know, it's not the greatest developers platform, but it's better than Windows.

579
00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:14,890
Speaker 0: I mean, you know you do it is under the hood, right?

580
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:15,431
Speaker 0: there is.

581
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:19,866
Speaker 0: it was originally Unix down there somewhere deep inside.

582
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:23,515
Speaker 0: there is Unix there and you know you can.

583
00:41:23,555 --> 00:41:31,509
Speaker 0: you can still get your Unix on in the OS X and Actually, you can install a lot of open source things like Fink and such.

584
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:34,659
Speaker 0: So you with OS X you can sort of get.

585
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:37,470
Speaker 0: you know, it's not as awesome as just running a Linux.

586
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:43,456
Speaker 0: But you can sort of get some of your Linux action and you can get all your nice-looking everything's easy action.

587
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:54,140
Speaker 1: and you get your multimedia creation and Action, if you're not a Mac person You're gonna be frustrated Anytime you want to deviate from what is already in front of you.

588
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,950
Speaker 1: if you want to change the behavior of something you're fucked.

589
00:41:57,592 --> 00:41:58,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they're just.

590
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,349
Speaker 1: you're totally done.

591
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:00,894
Speaker 0: That's the one thing I don't.

592
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:08,356
Speaker 1: and if you're used to context menus and like right-click do something that all goes away Well, it doesn't all go away, but it's not.

593
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:14,394
Speaker 1: right-clicking on things will often bring up menus that don't do what you expect them to Be doing pretty much.

594
00:42:14,956 --> 00:42:17,445
Speaker 1: but and also you're not gonna play any games.

595
00:42:17,646 --> 00:42:18,689
Speaker 1: There's no more gaming for you.

596
00:42:19,111 --> 00:42:21,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is all you can play Blizzard games.

597
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:28,474
Speaker 0: They're pretty much the only games on a Mac are like, you know, the game Blizzard World of Warcraft Starcraft Etc, etc, etc.

598
00:42:28,534 --> 00:42:31,746
Speaker 1: Unless you boot camp and dual boot, but then that kind of defeats the purpose.

599
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:32,690
Speaker 1: now you're using Windows again.

600
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's sort of it's like.

601
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:34,797
Speaker 0: well, why did you buy?

602
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:46,050
Speaker 0: if you're gonna run Windows right why unless you're loaded with money Like loaded with money why buy the expensive Mac hardware, you know, the Mac hardware is overpriced.

603
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:49,410
Speaker 0: I got a computer that's almost as fast as the Mac Pro.

604
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:52,288
Speaker 0: In fact, my RAM is faster than the RAM and a Mac Pro.

605
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,158
Speaker 0: All right, it depends for your purpose.

606
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,862
Speaker 1: if I was buying another media PC for the downstairs I would still consider a Mac I'd get like the lowest 10 Mac mini.

607
00:42:59,902 --> 00:43:02,637
Speaker 0: just because no I said why buy a Mac if you're gonna Run Windows.

608
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:03,405
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

609
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:16,677
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, the thing is actually what I kind of want to do with our Mac mini as it as we have you know, it's older and older is run Windows on it downstairs instead of OS 10 because then we get the Awesomeness of that hardware.

610
00:43:16,778 --> 00:43:19,350
Speaker 1: It's super silent and it's still pretty fast and reliable.

611
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:26,103
Speaker 1: it doesn't use a lot of power and we get the Bluetooth and all that this built-in but We can use the Netflix on demand in the living room.

612
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:27,409
Speaker 0: That would be okay.

613
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:28,935
Speaker 1: And the emulation.

614
00:43:28,955 --> 00:43:31,945
Speaker 1: I think that's what we're gonna do with that Mac mini at some point.

615
00:43:32,006 --> 00:43:33,250
Speaker 0: that's an okay plan.

616
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,194
Speaker 0: I see its merits but it has its.

617
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:42,267
Speaker 0: it has problems with that plan as well in That we wouldn't be able to use the handy-dandy remote that comes with the Mac mini.

618
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:42,950
Speaker 0: We never use it.

619
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:45,796
Speaker 1: Anyway, I use it sometimes No Cuz I have to time when we use it.

620
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:52,064
Speaker 1: if you start the DVD player from the desktop Then that meant that remote is just gonna fuck everything up.

621
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:57,810
Speaker 0: Yeah also though It's like it's got like the slot loading DVD tray and you know stuff like that.

622
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:01,757
Speaker 0: I'm not sure exactly how well Windows would handle the Mac mini plus.

623
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:09,399
Speaker 0: the Mac mini is really slow and I think it would even be slower with Windows than it would be with Especially for what we do.

624
00:44:09,419 --> 00:44:17,729
Speaker 0: we have to get an XP And we'd probably want to get the media center edition of XP that has that, you know, all that kind of stuff going on anyway.

625
00:44:18,691 --> 00:44:21,019
Speaker 0: So the windows they move on to the windows.

626
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,490
Speaker 1: if you want to play games you got to use windows pretty much.

627
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:26,257
Speaker 0: I mean, you know you could.

628
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:32,222
Speaker 0: if you're if you need to use windows for something that's not a game You can run windows in VMware or something like that.

629
00:44:32,262 --> 00:44:33,649
Speaker 0: But VMware is totally different.

630
00:44:33,669 --> 00:44:33,830
Speaker 0: show.

631
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,343
Speaker 1: Do you know what actually do?

632
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:36,190
Speaker 0: a show on virtual?

633
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:36,992
Speaker 1: I think we did.

634
00:44:37,033 --> 00:44:48,815
Speaker 1: but if you want to create content and you don't want to use OS 10 You have to use windows because the majority of the things for Linux for content creation, especially multimedia Are garbage.

635
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:53,790
Speaker 0: Well, I mean you can create content with Linux, but you're not gonna be able to create the highest quality content.

636
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:56,906
Speaker 0: You'll be okay, and it's not gonna be as easy.

637
00:44:56,926 --> 00:45:00,500
Speaker 1: Oh Don't even say that with video you're hosed.

638
00:45:00,941 --> 00:45:01,584
Speaker 0: Yeah video.

639
00:45:01,604 --> 00:45:02,085
Speaker 0: You're pretty hosed.

640
00:45:02,126 --> 00:45:03,370
Speaker 1: You're absolutely hosed.

641
00:45:04,391 --> 00:45:09,190
Speaker 0: But at least you know windows right windows isn't really big on the content creation.

642
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:15,130
Speaker 0: It just so happens though that the Adobe software is for Windows and for Mac.

643
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,442
Speaker 0: So because of that windows is capable of decent content creation.

644
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:24,597
Speaker 0: if the Adobe suite dropped windows Windows would be like devoid of content creation.

645
00:45:24,617 --> 00:45:29,270
Speaker 0: I mean that yeah, there's other programs like the Sony whatever and the avid something something.

646
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:35,230
Speaker 0: But really without the Adobe suite pretty much the Mac would be the only one in the content creation area.

647
00:45:35,995 --> 00:45:43,450
Speaker 0: all right, but Windows has the gaming and Windows has the fact that it runs on just about every hardware without a lot of issues.

648
00:45:43,932 --> 00:45:50,550
Speaker 0: Right like it just kind of works, and if something doesn't work you can get the driver for it And it supports you know every piece of hardware in the known universe.

649
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:55,107
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of people put down Linux saying oh, it doesn't support hardware blah blah blah blah.

650
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:55,287
Speaker 0: right.

651
00:45:55,809 --> 00:46:03,929
Speaker 0: well It doesn't support as much hardware as Windows but actually all the hardware Linux supports or most of it anyway it supports automatically.

652
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:08,262
Speaker 0: a Clean Windows install really doesn't support that much hardware.

653
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:10,530
Speaker 0: you need to go out and get drivers from somewhere

654
00:46:10,932 --> 00:46:24,170
Speaker 1: Install XP on a new computer a lot of times You can't see a lot of your SATA drives or all these sorts of hardware And you need special boot disks and special driver disks and all that just because the XP installer never gets updated.

655
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:30,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, there might be some hardware out there less and less every day But like there's some people they can't get their wireless card to work in Linux.

656
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:37,566
Speaker 0: right But if your wireless card does work in Linux it will just work in Windows.

657
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:44,494
Speaker 0: your wireless card might work But you might have to go out and you're probably gonna have to go out and get a driver and install and do a little Process thing.

658
00:46:44,795 --> 00:46:47,828
Speaker 0: it might be easy to do it, but it's still something you have to do.

659
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:52,610
Speaker 0: OS X because it only runs and is only meant to run on Macs.

660
00:46:53,693 --> 00:46:55,430
Speaker 0: It really supports almost no hardware.

661
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:59,321
Speaker 0: I mean it actually supports more hardware than you think it would.

662
00:46:59,381 --> 00:47:06,297
Speaker 1: but at the same time we bought we had a wireless USB keyboard Yep, and OS X didn't support it.

663
00:47:06,378 --> 00:47:23,010
Speaker 1: every time it booted every time it logged out every time anything happened It would say hey I can't figure out what kind of keyboard you've got and make you type all this crap so it could figure out what the keyboard Was and then it would work fine, but it would always forget those settings and make you do it again.

664
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,842
Speaker 1: But even worse if you like force-killed the thing that was saying.

665
00:47:26,862 --> 00:47:28,166
Speaker 1: hey, I don't understand your keyboard.

666
00:47:28,186 --> 00:47:29,550
Speaker 1: It just worked fine.

667
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:34,236
Speaker 1: Anyway, OS X just was a jerk about it Yep, so we eventually we just gave.

668
00:47:34,276 --> 00:47:38,790
Speaker 1: we bought the stupid Mac wireless keyboard which by the way is a very hot little piece of hard.

669
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:42,864
Speaker 0: Well, and I don't really I won't like it for a desk, but for a living room.

670
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:45,561
Speaker 0: It's pretty awesome because it's really small It's wireless.

671
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:49,043
Speaker 0: It's Bluetooth So it doesn't take up USB slot and it works.

672
00:47:49,425 --> 00:47:50,430
Speaker 0: and it works well with the Mac.

673
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:51,134
Speaker 0: You know it's like.

674
00:47:51,154 --> 00:47:52,724
Speaker 0: it's like having a little control panel.

675
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,536
Speaker 0: You know eject Volume up volume down.

676
00:47:55,556 --> 00:47:56,280
Speaker 0: you know it's.

677
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,290
Speaker 0: it's really great little media center controlling thing But on my desk it'd be terrible.

678
00:48:02,052 --> 00:48:12,430
Speaker 0: So yeah windows the other advantage of windows right is that it runs Pretty much all the other soft all the proprietary software in the known universe, which is big for businesses.

679
00:48:12,691 --> 00:48:17,346
Speaker 0: I mean, you know people don't think about it that much right, but let's say like my uncle.

680
00:48:17,486 --> 00:48:18,670
Speaker 0: He's a dentist, right?

681
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:22,563
Speaker 0: He has lots of software that he needs to run as a dentist.

682
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:25,112
Speaker 0: He's got you know the Owns.

683
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:26,638
Speaker 0: the old is the dentistry.

684
00:48:26,678 --> 00:48:29,850
Speaker 0: It's his dentistry, so he needs accounting software, right?

685
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,950
Speaker 0: He needs software to deal with people's insurance and dental records.

686
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:38,810
Speaker 0: He's in the software to talk to the x-ray machine and store all the x-rays in a big database.

687
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:50,461
Speaker 1: Actually, that's one way where if people really want to get Linux on the desktop and corporations that means open source developers have to get On all these kind of niche boring proprietary kind of things.

688
00:48:50,622 --> 00:48:50,882
Speaker 0: Yep.

689
00:48:50,963 --> 00:48:53,650
Speaker 0: It's called a vertical market is the correct term.

690
00:48:53,731 --> 00:49:02,030
Speaker 0: I believe you know like What other operating system is gonna have the the dental x-ray software windows?

691
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,069
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get that on Linux or Mac.

692
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,984
Speaker 1: Software might just run in wine, but that's in my run it.

693
00:49:09,024 --> 00:49:10,450
Speaker 0: there is a chance it might run in wine.

694
00:49:10,511 --> 00:49:11,970
Speaker 1: Yes, but here's the way I look at it.

695
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:17,970
Speaker 0: If you're buying a computer to run that software running it and why it is probably not the best idea.

696
00:49:18,132 --> 00:49:29,259
Speaker 1: But in the end, here's the way I really look at it to me By default it's bridge Linux because Linux if you don't need something that Linux cannot provide Then Linux is great.

697
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,549
Speaker 1: It's like the default and it's free.

698
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:34,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then if you need something it's like you looks like I do this and this and this.

699
00:49:34,226 --> 00:49:37,418
Speaker 1: I don't need anything or I want to play games suddenly.

700
00:49:37,478 --> 00:49:42,902
Speaker 1: All right now I need Windows and Windows will do everything I need and play games or I need Adobe whatever.

701
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:43,264
Speaker 1: All right.

702
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:47,364
Speaker 1: Well, I can use Windows or Apple All right, which one of those two do I want?

703
00:49:47,424 --> 00:49:48,570
Speaker 1: and then it's a matter of preference.

704
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:57,259
Speaker 1: But if you don't need one of those proprietary things I feel like it's at the point where you can go with Linux and it'll do everything you want and even your grandma can use It.

705
00:49:57,364 --> 00:49:59,436
Speaker 0: yeah Well, it is the thing about Linux right?

706
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:09,669
Speaker 0: is that while Linux might not have the content creation and they don't have the gaming so Much though they actually have more gaming than Mac if you don't count the Blizzard stuff, right actually a lot more.

707
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,901
Speaker 0: Yeah, Wesnoth is pretty hot and well, it's not this on all of us.

708
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:14,968
Speaker 1: It doesn't count but it's on Linux.

709
00:50:15,269 --> 00:50:22,314
Speaker 0: I guess Yeah, but Linux actually has you know, lots of open-source gaming kind of action going on But what Linux does?

710
00:50:22,334 --> 00:50:27,630
Speaker 0: the other thing that the other OS is don't is that it has all the basics covered, right?

711
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:33,210
Speaker 0: You're way browsing your instant messaging your office saying all your normal stuff.

712
00:50:33,812 --> 00:50:39,390
Speaker 0: It's got your mp3 playing your video watching actually is the best video watching OS I say, right?

713
00:50:41,473 --> 00:50:43,344
Speaker 0: And it's got all the other things.

714
00:50:43,424 --> 00:50:48,382
Speaker 0: it might not do them Amazingly, but there's a piece of open soft soft sort of software out there.

715
00:50:48,422 --> 00:50:50,570
Speaker 0: That'll do it like open sauce open sauce.

716
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:57,726
Speaker 0: Yes, now it, you know, for example audio recording, okay You're not gonna get your super Pro Tools, but you get your resounds in.

717
00:50:57,746 --> 00:50:58,993
Speaker 0: your audacity Is which you're?

718
00:50:59,234 --> 00:50:59,636
Speaker 0: you know, they're on.

719
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:00,561
Speaker 0: the audacity is on.

720
00:51:00,581 --> 00:51:03,598
Speaker 0: the other OS is too, but you know And it does the job.

721
00:51:03,678 --> 00:51:05,510
Speaker 0: it can do a lot of jobs.

722
00:51:06,352 --> 00:51:19,830
Speaker 0: The thing about Linux though, is that on the other level the below-seeing level where it talks to the hardware You know the Linux kernel what what an operating system does talks to the hardware So the software doesn't have to talk to the hardware.

723
00:51:20,472 --> 00:51:30,290
Speaker 0: The way Linux talks to the hardware, even though it can't talk to as much heart different hardware as Windows can The way it talks to the hardware is better in every way.

724
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:34,650
Speaker 0: I mean you go to a computer science class, right and they say blah blah blah.

725
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:39,186
Speaker 0: They'll talk about like memory management, which is something every operating system does is to manage the memory.

726
00:51:39,407 --> 00:51:44,823
Speaker 0: Windows kind of Windows kind of waste your right, right, but it says Linux, you know, it'll be like.

727
00:51:45,044 --> 00:51:46,890
Speaker 0: this is the best way to manage the memory.

728
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:48,414
Speaker 0: That's the way Linux does it.

729
00:51:48,715 --> 00:51:52,025
Speaker 0: Windows doesn't do it that way Mac does it all sort of that way.

730
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:53,730
Speaker 0: Linux does it the correct?

731
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:58,625
Speaker 0: Computer science way and it does everything the correct computer science way.

732
00:51:58,705 --> 00:52:04,030
Speaker 0: It is under the hood Superior and pretty much most fashions, you know.

733
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:09,010
Speaker 0: So if you don't need a piece of software that won't can't talk to Linux.

734
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:19,904
Speaker 0: Linux is the best because it talks to your hardware more properly than the other operating systems and you're gonna get less Crashing more security more stability and it's free.

735
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:24,016
Speaker 1: The thing is we keep saying Linux For the purposes of this discussion.

736
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:27,046
Speaker 0: We basically mean Ubuntu for a desktop user.

737
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:28,010
Speaker 0: Ubuntu is the way to go.

738
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:29,890
Speaker 1: We're talking about talking about servers.

739
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:38,495
Speaker 0: I didn't even come up But in terms of something that talks to your hardware links kernel is what talks to the hardware in the fantastic But no one cares about that.

740
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:39,620
Speaker 1: They think oh I use Linux.

741
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:40,061
Speaker 0: Yep.

742
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:41,005
Speaker 0: That's what they think.

743
00:52:41,246 --> 00:52:42,230
Speaker 1: All right, I think that's it.

744
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:43,600
Speaker 1: I think we're back in the swing of things.

745
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,586
Speaker 1: There'll be shows all week.

746
00:52:44,607 --> 00:52:45,070
Speaker 1: Don't worry

747
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:54,456
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's it's it's a it's a crazy world where simultaneously like, you know blessed and cursed in that, you know back in the day It's like Mac or PC blah

748
00:52:54,476 --> 00:52:55,259
Speaker 1: blah blah blah,

749
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:59,670
Speaker 0: you know, and there'd be all these fights and there would be a clear winner here A clear winner there.

750
00:52:59,891 --> 00:53:01,156
Speaker 1: It's at the point where you can't.

751
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:11,359
Speaker 1: anyone who says any one OS now of the big three is Absolutely superior unqualified is Bullshitting you because that's you can't say that anymore.

752
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,609
Speaker 1: They all do something better than the other two.

753
00:53:13,629 --> 00:53:15,537
Speaker 0: Yeah It's sort of like the same department.

754
00:53:15,557 --> 00:53:17,084
Speaker 0: We're getting to with the game consoles.

755
00:53:17,164 --> 00:53:22,242
Speaker 1: Also, is that you know, I got like If you're a hardcore gamer, you kind of need to own all three consoles.

756
00:53:22,443 --> 00:53:25,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like we get your DS your PSPs Oh, yeah, DS.

757
00:53:25,512 --> 00:53:29,727
Speaker 0: yet on all five console PS threes, you know your wheeze your x360s, right?

758
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:31,899
Speaker 0: You know these consoles.

759
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:36,786
Speaker 0: and back in the day You know people always argue as if there there's this sort of thinking.

760
00:53:36,806 --> 00:53:39,798
Speaker 0: there has to be One is better and one is worse.

761
00:53:39,919 --> 00:53:42,148
Speaker 0: period right something is better than the other thing.

762
00:53:42,188 --> 00:53:51,799
Speaker 0: But really now everything is sort of equally good just in different ways and it's Good and bad and that it's not perfect.

763
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:58,783
Speaker 0: So you'll always be pissed off because it's never gonna be perfect But you're always gonna have something good no matter what you choose.

764
00:53:58,864 --> 00:54:00,369
Speaker 0: So what are you gonna do?

765
00:54:01,093 --> 00:54:02,459
Speaker 1: You know what I'm gonna do me into.

766
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,806
