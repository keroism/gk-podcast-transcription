1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,287
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, April 30th.

2
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:11,890
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,593
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,880
Speaker 0: Chrysler's bankrupt and this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,442
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about how to not suck at eating out.

6
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:26,947
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,631
Speaker 0: We're back.

8
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:32,534
Speaker 1: Oh no.

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:50,504
Speaker 1: Evan, I sort of, you know, this isn't like big news or anything, but I sort of gave up on, suffice to say, not because there's anything wrong with it on the, from the user perspective, but because I'm certain administrating the behind the scenes of it, it's basically poop right now.

10
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:51,449
Speaker 1: It's super poop.

11
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:52,212
Speaker 1: It's terrible.

12
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:53,477
Speaker 1: Laconica is not so good.

13
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:57,373
Speaker 0: It has a very high total cost of ownership, I would say that.

14
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:57,755
Speaker 0: Yes.

15
00:00:57,776 --> 00:01:01,436
Speaker 0: Because I mean, I kind of poked at it every now and then and I can see

16
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:14,665
Speaker 1: like they have, they have an admirable goal of making it as easy to use and set up as WordPress, which is, you know, they, they're on the right track, you know, they want it to be that they know what's right, but it's not going, it's not actually going in that direction right now.

17
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:15,772
Speaker 1: It's a huge pain in the ass.

18
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:16,314
Speaker 1: It sucks.

19
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:17,058
Speaker 0: See, now here's the thing.

20
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:26,365
Speaker 0: It would have been okay if it had at least properly integrated with all the Twitter stuff, but it did kind of, kind of, but a lot of the applications didn't work with it.

21
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:26,787
Speaker 0: Yeah.

22
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:27,692
Speaker 0: A lot of embedded.

23
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:36,072
Speaker 1: I think that's actually, that's actually more a problem of the Twitter clients, not, you know, because, uh, Laconic has the same exact API as Twitter.

24
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:39,493
Speaker 1: It's like any Twitter app should actually be able to work with Laconic.

25
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:47,446
Speaker 1: All you have to do is be able to change the URL, but what I was saying is that the change, the URL feature, that's what I was saying, that almost every app just hard codes, Twitter, and you're fucked.

26
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:47,748
Speaker 0: Yep.

27
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:55,588
Speaker 1: They hard like tweet deck could work perfectly with Laconica, except you can't change the URL from twitter.com to like, you know, whatever your Laconica is.

28
00:01:55,648 --> 00:02:02,886
Speaker 1: So anyway, it was, well, I guess a lot of it's open source, so you could, you could, but anyway, it's a huge pain in the ass, right?

29
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:03,630
Speaker 1: To run this thing.

30
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,933
Speaker 0: We should have just taken every open source Twitter app and just forked it to Laconica.

31
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:12,794
Speaker 1: Anyway, uh, the thing is you need to change the URL to the specific Laconica server.

32
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,945
Speaker 0: I fork it to where there's a text box.

33
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:16,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

34
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:20,286
Speaker 1: Um, but anyway, it's a huge pain in the ass, but people like it.

35
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,960
Speaker 1: People were using it and I sort of feel bad shutting them off.

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,281
Speaker 1: Right.

37
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,652
Speaker 1: So I'm just gonna let it sit there.

38
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:30,395
Speaker 1: I'm not touching it ever unless, you know, if it breaks, it's going to stay broken.

39
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:31,259
Speaker 1: I'm not going to fix it.

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,535
Speaker 1: If it continues to work, I'm going to let it continue to work.

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,825
Speaker 0: A spam farm.

42
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:37,728
Speaker 0: It'll disappear.

43
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:38,331
Speaker 1: Well, that's true.

44
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:44,876
Speaker 1: Um, uh, but you know, maybe someday, you know, like maybe Laconica 1.0 will be very nice.

45
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:47,406
Speaker 1: And in that case I will upgrade to.

46
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:53,258
Speaker 0: at this point, I really predict that Twitter just one and Twitter is going to be there until something else completely takes it over.

47
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:53,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

48
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:56,315
Speaker 1: Uh, so I just sort of stopped using it really.

49
00:02:56,335 --> 00:03:00,921
Speaker 1: And I'm just using Twitter and it's, it's way better because everyone else is actually using it.

50
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:02,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm, I'm switching.

51
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:07,844
Speaker 0: I have a Twitter account that the only thing in there was stuff automatically sent from Laconica and that stopped working at some point.

52
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:11,790
Speaker 1: I started, you know, and the thing is, you know, I read an article today that was totally true.

53
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,421
Speaker 1: It's one of those things like, duh.

54
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:17,869
Speaker 1: You know, I remember the article that said, uh, every people, everyone installs iPhone apps, doesn't use them.

55
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,511
Speaker 1: Right.

56
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:25,871
Speaker 1: This article was like, most people who joined Twitter stop using it after like 30 days or bear or just they join, but they don't actually use it.

57
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:26,596
Speaker 0: Well, think about it.

58
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:31,525
Speaker 0: I mean, you hear about it in the news, especially now where all the mainstream media, like in Costa Rica, right?

59
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:38,211
Speaker 0: We sat down and tried to watch some Spanish news and then we'd watched some CNN and all this stuff one night, you know, just to see what was going on in the world.

60
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:40,926
Speaker 0: And every news was talking about Twitter.

61
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:44,344
Speaker 1: Every news is talking about Twitter, all the newscaster sharing their Twitters.

62
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:54,432
Speaker 1: You know, I even saw when I was in Florida on the TV, uh, I think CNN was using Skype to bring someone in for a video interview and there was a Skype logo on the screen.

63
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:55,759
Speaker 1: So it's like, really?

64
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,853
Speaker 1: It's like, Whoa, the TV news is doing the same shit.

65
00:03:58,994 --> 00:03:59,315
Speaker 1: I do.

66
00:03:59,335 --> 00:03:59,396
Speaker 1: Why?

67
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:01,285
Speaker 1: Why are they on TV?

68
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:02,169
Speaker 1: I should be on TV.

69
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,697
Speaker 1: I'm doing the same exact thing as they are.

70
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:14,995
Speaker 0: Um, no, but you know, and then just, well, plus, I mean, Twitter is not that useful unless you're one of the people who is either going to use it for what it's good at or come up with a new way to use it.

71
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:20,706
Speaker 0: Most people will use it for the novelty and they'll basically just be doing what that video did.

72
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:39,580
Speaker 1: It's sort of the same problem that I had when I would, you know, with Facebook and things is that if you just log into it, right, if you make an account, if you don't actually use it, like you have to actually put in some effort, you have to go out and follow some people or friends, some people, and you have to, you know, type in some stuff.

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,993
Speaker 1: You actually have to put some work into it to sort of, you know, crank them, you know, the flywheel and get it going.

74
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:53,558
Speaker 1: And if you don't do that, you're just like, and you just look at it and try to figure it out, but you don't actually put in the work, you know, to get it going.

75
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:57,544
Speaker 1: You're just going to go, what the fuck is this and stop and not even and just ignore it.

76
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:07,083
Speaker 0: Well, I think a lot of people just don't have, you know, someone who's not super into the Internet and technology doesn't give you instant gratification is going to hear about it, think it's cool, think it's like Facebook.

77
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:10,507
Speaker 0: They'll get on it and they'll start typing into it and I'll just type stuff for a while.

78
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:14,833
Speaker 0: But they probably won't figure out to follow anyone or even have anyone to follow.

79
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:15,559
Speaker 0: And then they'll give up.

80
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:17,614
Speaker 1: I mean, Twitter sort of is helping itself now.

81
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:29,258
Speaker 1: It's like when you when you make an account, it's sort of like tells you some interesting people to follow and sort of helps you automatically follow some famous people and stuff like that, you know, but whatever.

82
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:29,861
Speaker 1: So.

83
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:30,262
Speaker 1: But yeah.

84
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:39,024
Speaker 1: Anyway, I was on the tweets and somebody I've messaged, you know, what, you know, show schedules you return to will probably do a Thursday tomorrow.

85
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,557
Speaker 1: And people are real excited about a Thursday tomorrow.

86
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:42,924
Speaker 1: So here it is.

87
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:48,432
Speaker 0: So tomorrow became today and exactly didn't know what to do the show on until five minutes ago.

88
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:49,376
Speaker 0: That's fine.

89
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:52,794
Speaker 0: In fact, until about five minutes and twenty six seconds ago.

90
00:05:52,814 --> 00:05:53,397
Speaker 1: That's all right.

91
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:53,839
Speaker 1: Yeah.

92
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,052
Speaker 0: But we're not talking about Twitter.

93
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:56,777
Speaker 0: Don't worry.

94
00:05:57,179 --> 00:06:02,528
Speaker 1: And, you know, we've been away from the show for a while, so we've built up quite a queue of things to discuss.

95
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:02,910
Speaker 0: Yes.

96
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,453
Speaker 1: And we want hope that we'll refrain from draining the queue in one episode.

97
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:12,257
Speaker 0: I will point out for the uninitiated that Scott was in Florida for much of last week.

98
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:12,779
Speaker 1: Well, we've got.

99
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,904
Speaker 1: we got me in Florida.

100
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:19,170
Speaker 0: Emily and I were in Costa Rica spending a couple of days in the Ocata resort.

101
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:24,832
Speaker 0: And also the rest of our time in the cloud forest at the Continental Divide.

102
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:27,181
Speaker 1: And also I was a job getting.

103
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,068
Speaker 1: So there is a lot going on.

104
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:33,270
Speaker 1: Anyway, you want to you want to go on to like news thing today?

105
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:33,813
Speaker 1: What I guess.

106
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:37,781
Speaker 0: But at least I can for a lot of people who I know are waiting for the show on Costa Rica.

107
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:41,484
Speaker 0: Emily and I are going to record that probably this weekend, maybe Monday.

108
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:42,390
Speaker 0: You'll get it at some point.

109
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:47,195
Speaker 0: I also have I took like five hundred pictures, maybe a quarter of them are worth looking at.

110
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:48,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

111
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:51,703
Speaker 1: You know, just dump them on the flicker and then delete the ones that I learned.

112
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:52,730
Speaker 0: I can say one thing.

113
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,098
Speaker 0: I learned a lot about S.L.R.

114
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:54,580
Speaker 0: cameras.

115
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:55,204
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

116
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:55,687
Speaker 0: Yeah.

117
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:56,270
Speaker 0: All right.

118
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,155
Speaker 0: I kind of like S.L.R.

119
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:57,598
Speaker 0: cameras.

120
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,040
Speaker 1: Yeah.

121
00:06:58,362 --> 00:06:59,047
Speaker 1: I'd like it, too.

122
00:06:59,127 --> 00:06:59,933
Speaker 1: But it's sort of like Twitter.

123
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:00,981
Speaker 1: You got to put some effort into it.

124
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:01,424
Speaker 1: Yeah.

125
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:02,109
Speaker 1: Anything else?

126
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:10,996
Speaker 0: Thing is, you'd be amazed how quickly like how much you can learn from reading five minutes of a fact that says this is what this does and this is what I mean.

127
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:17,327
Speaker 1: You know, my I'm still like trying to get more out of my digital camera because I've seen some my regular non S.L.R.

128
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:21,713
Speaker 1: digital camera because I see other people like take amazing pictures of these freaking cameras.

129
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:23,686
Speaker 1: You know, it's like the point and shoot things.

130
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:24,794
Speaker 1: It's like I have one of those.

131
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:25,942
Speaker 1: I have a pretty good one of those.

132
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:27,573
Speaker 1: Why doesn't my picture look like that?

133
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:30,249
Speaker 1: So I've been playing around with it a lot more.

134
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:32,143
Speaker 1: And I think I've been taking better pictures with it.

135
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:37,978
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I was looking at the kinds of pictures people take with my camera and I'm pretty much doing the best I can do.

136
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's good.

137
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:40,392
Speaker 0: With my two megapixels.

138
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:41,457
Speaker 1: Yeah.

139
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:42,863
Speaker 1: Time to move up to make.

140
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:45,597
Speaker 1: I mean, the iPhone, I think it almost has two megapixels.

141
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:46,281
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

142
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:52,438
Speaker 0: Remember, we're at the point where megapixels matter a lot less than what kind of stuff is on the back end and the lenses.

143
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:53,665
Speaker 1: The iPhones.

144
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,314
Speaker 1: major problem is it doesn't have autofocus.

145
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:55,635
Speaker 0: Yeah.

146
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,524
Speaker 0: Well, it also doesn't really have lenses.

147
00:07:58,569 --> 00:07:59,916
Speaker 1: You can go and get lenses for it.

148
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:00,519
Speaker 0: Yeah.

149
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,168
Speaker 0: I've seen pictures of those and those.

150
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,417
Speaker 0: just that that's a side talking right.

151
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:06,023
Speaker 1: there is a side talking.

152
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:09,238
Speaker 0: So news that isn't the bird flu.

153
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,230
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about that on Monday, probably.

154
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:11,631
Speaker 1: All right.

155
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:13,882
Speaker 1: Well, this is a this is sort of a Monday news.

156
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:17,659
Speaker 1: So it but it's not bird flu or swine flu or so.

157
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,104
Speaker 1: We have.

158
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:21,975
Speaker 1: we have our Internet service from Cablevision.

159
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:22,377
Speaker 1: Right.

160
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:27,436
Speaker 1: And they give you optimum voice, optimum TV and optimum.

161
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,502
Speaker 0: You got to pay for it.

162
00:08:28,622 --> 00:08:28,843
Speaker 1: Right.

163
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:29,084
Speaker 1: Yeah.

164
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:30,411
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's the way.

165
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:32,162
Speaker 1: their plan is a pretty simple plan.

166
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:32,403
Speaker 1: Right.

167
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:37,953
Speaker 1: Is that if you get all three services, the triple play, they're 30 bucks each for a total of ninety dollars.

168
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:38,215
Speaker 1: Right.

169
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:41,130
Speaker 1: If you get just one service, it's fifty dollars.

170
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,437
Speaker 1: So the Internet is fifty dollars.

171
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:43,724
Speaker 1: The voice is fifty dollars.

172
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,474
Speaker 1: The TV is fifty dollars.

173
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:48,975
Speaker 1: But then, you know, you got HBO's and all sorts of packages going on there.

174
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:49,840
Speaker 1: But that's typical.

175
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:51,629
Speaker 1: They're coming out.

176
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,250
Speaker 1: They're rolling it out real soon, like next month ish in certain places.

177
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,963
Speaker 1: Optimum ultra, you know, an awesome ultra is.

178
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:03,205
Speaker 0: Well, I do because you already told me I already read about it, but you can.

179
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:07,527
Speaker 1: you can break the for ninety nine ninety nine, which is one hundred dollars.

180
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,050
Speaker 0: Ninety nine.

181
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,833
Speaker 0: Ninety nine.

182
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,269
Speaker 1: They will give you also online Internet connection.

183
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:13,093
Speaker 0: What is this, an ad?

184
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:13,534
Speaker 1: Right.

185
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:15,423
Speaker 1: I don't know what the upload speed is.

186
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:20,823
Speaker 1: The download speed is one hundred and one megabits per second.

187
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:27,633
Speaker 0: Now, there are many questions about this, as in what what can we expect from the upstream providers?

188
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,095
Speaker 0: Yeah.

189
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:28,558
Speaker 1: Yeah.

190
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,969
Speaker 1: But I'm sure I mean, our upstream is like two.

191
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:31,913
Speaker 1: Right.

192
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:34,460
Speaker 1: So and our downstream is over 10.

193
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:34,701
Speaker 1: It's like 14.

194
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:39,561
Speaker 1: So I mean, the upstream of about 10 will keep it to the same.

195
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,446
Speaker 0: Here's the question.

196
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,777
Speaker 0: Is this always going to be unmetered?

197
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:42,878
Speaker 0: Yeah.

198
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:48,728
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, Cable Vision is actually one of the better Internet providers.

199
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:49,231
Speaker 1: You know, they don't.

200
00:09:49,593 --> 00:09:53,979
Speaker 1: I've never gotten a complaint about bit torrenting or Pirate Bay or or anything like that.

201
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:54,844
Speaker 1: They're just totally cool.

202
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,755
Speaker 0: The thing that it's so totally.

203
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,897
Speaker 1: they're not so good with the cable and some other things, but we don't care about that.

204
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:00,320
Speaker 0: Yeah.

205
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,106
Speaker 0: But here's the problem.

206
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:05,315
Speaker 1: As an Internet service provider, Cable Vision is pretty awesome with our current with our current service.

207
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:07,205
Speaker 0: It's already faster than we need.

208
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:09,924
Speaker 0: I know because they won't let us host on that ultra whatever.

209
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:14,147
Speaker 0: There's no way you can get the business class, but that's too expensive and not fast enough.

210
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,519
Speaker 1: Well, you can get the business class with the ultra.

211
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,272
Speaker 0: Even so, it's not going to be enough.

212
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:19,573
Speaker 1: Yeah.

213
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:23,270
Speaker 1: The thing is, I mean, one hundred and one is so fast.

214
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,139
Speaker 1: First of all, you pretty much need gigabit.

215
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:32,799
Speaker 1: If you actually are getting one hundred from the outside for the outside, you need a gigabit inside or else it's just not going to happen.

216
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:36,197
Speaker 0: Well, now, because if you're fully switched, it won't really matter.

217
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,719
Speaker 0: Well, remember, there's no collisions on a fully switched FTX.

218
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,706
Speaker 1: No, no, but one hundred and one megabits per second is greater than so one hundred network.

219
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,955
Speaker 0: You're going to lose that one megabit per second.

220
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:47,417
Speaker 1: Yes.

221
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,484
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

222
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:51,432
Speaker 1: I'm paying ninety nine dollars a month.

223
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,779
Speaker 1: That's twelve hundred a year.

224
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,308
Speaker 1: I want that one megabit.

225
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:55,415
Speaker 0: You're not going to be able to use it.

226
00:10:55,576 --> 00:11:04,980
Speaker 0: And if you have a good switch and you have two computers connecting and you set it up right, you can still use that hundred and one with a hundred based network.

227
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:05,543
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

228
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:07,976
Speaker 1: But yet it's still that stupid fast.

229
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:13,138
Speaker 1: Think about how fast you could download like a movie, like a full HD movie, like.

230
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:17,334
Speaker 1: Pretty well, I mean, seriously, it's ludicrous speed.

231
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:25,953
Speaker 0: All right, so but what about all these articles about how the Internet's going to slow down and stop and we're running out of bandwidth and everyone's going to have to meet her and it's too expensive.

232
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:30,677
Speaker 1: Cablevision apparently disagrees with, you know, Comcast and Time Warner and everyone else.

233
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:31,300
Speaker 1: I don't know.

234
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,004
Speaker 0: I'm leery.

235
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:32,506
Speaker 0: Yeah.

236
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,496
Speaker 1: And Fios also seems to disagree.

237
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:38,153
Speaker 1: It's like Verizon and Cablevision are like on one side.

238
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,385
Speaker 0: like Fios, though, has a lot of problems.

239
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:40,827
Speaker 1: It does.

240
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,179
Speaker 1: But its problems are not bandwidth and speed.

241
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,103
Speaker 1: Its problems are else.

242
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:44,806
Speaker 0: Yeah.

243
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:45,993
Speaker 0: But see the else.

244
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:51,170
Speaker 0: when it comes to the fact that my co-workers come in every day and they're like, yeah, my files was down for like four hours last night.

245
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:53,803
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you got to pay for business if you want reliability.

246
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:53,864
Speaker 1: No.

247
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,423
Speaker 1: But, you know, the problems are not bandwidth.

248
00:11:57,464 --> 00:11:57,645
Speaker 1: Right.

249
00:11:57,665 --> 00:12:01,665
Speaker 1: So on the bandwidth issue alone, you have Fios and Cablevision and then everyone else.

250
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,375
Speaker 1: So I think that's interesting.

251
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,444
Speaker 0: I think there's much more important news than the fact that you can get more Internet than you need.

252
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:09,658
Speaker 1: One hundred and one megabits per second.

253
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,728
Speaker 1: I need that for what I would pay for.

254
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:12,753
Speaker 0: What would you use it for?

255
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:19,021
Speaker 1: Oh, that would have been toward going all day getting what I would go buy like a NAS and load it up.

256
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:19,885
Speaker 0: What would you get?

257
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,976
Speaker 0: You know, there's a lot of stuff out there.

258
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:23,508
Speaker 1: Every thing ever.

259
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:26,737
Speaker 0: You don't like things.

260
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:27,943
Speaker 1: Just because I can.

261
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,056
Speaker 0: Scott, you used to hate the fanboys who did that.

262
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:35,586
Speaker 0: Remember the guys at RIT who would go on the direct connect and download like four terabytes.

263
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:36,952
Speaker 1: They were on a meager O.C.

264
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:37,354
Speaker 1: three.

265
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:39,685
Speaker 1: This is a is one hundred and one megabit.

266
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,132
Speaker 0: They were on two O.C.

267
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:42,558
Speaker 0: threes and a T3.

268
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,145
Speaker 1: How is an O.C.

269
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:44,346
Speaker 1: three?

270
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,773
Speaker 1: One hundred and one megabits per second.

271
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:46,758
Speaker 0: An O.C.

272
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:47,642
Speaker 0: three is a lot.

273
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:48,226
Speaker 1: Yeah.

274
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:48,969
Speaker 1: But I don't know how much.

275
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,157
Speaker 1: I don't think I don't know.

276
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:53,396
Speaker 0: Remember, it was Internet, too, which actually means a lot more.

277
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:58,162
Speaker 1: That does mean I would pay one hundred dollars a month to get an Internet to even without Internet one.

278
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:03,932
Speaker 0: I can't express to you how much I would pay to have the legal right to use Internet to from my home.

279
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:04,435
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

280
00:13:04,475 --> 00:13:05,885
Speaker 0: Without having to go back to school.

281
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:07,093
Speaker 1: I mean, and then have to pay.

282
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:13,614
Speaker 1: You know, I had to buy like a Cisco router that would, you know, automatically route the Internet, two packets over one wire and the Internet one packets of the.

283
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:14,097
Speaker 0: You know what?

284
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,653
Speaker 1: If I ever get rich and then IPv6, I would pay so much.

285
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:26,859
Speaker 0: If I ever get rich enough, I'll just pay to be a student again, be a student forever and just have my my connection to Internet, too, from my apartment on campus somewhere.

286
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:27,924
Speaker 1: I don't know.

287
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,310
Speaker 1: I would pay to be.

288
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,689
Speaker 1: I know if I was rich enough, I would make a school.

289
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:34,093
Speaker 1: Right.

290
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,607
Speaker 0: Well, it's got school for the four gifted students.

291
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:37,050
Speaker 0: Yes.

292
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,920
Speaker 0: So Chrysler actually filed for bankruptcy.

293
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:41,884
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

294
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,634
Speaker 0: And I guess everyone saw this coming.

295
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:54,285
Speaker 0: But I think I don't think I need to say they're going to be a lot of ramifications to this, not just in the business world, but mostly just any kind of public perception ripple.

296
00:13:54,305 --> 00:14:00,590
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's sort of a good thing, actually, in that if you look at history, right, at least the history of the United States, there have been a lot of brands.

297
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:01,012
Speaker 1: Right.

298
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:04,150
Speaker 1: And there are a lot of brands that were old and don't exist anymore.

299
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:09,977
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, there was like they used to be cars from brands like Tucker or Studebaker.

300
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:10,479
Speaker 1: Right.

301
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,841
Speaker 1: And, you know, we used to have like, you know, I don't know, lots of stuff doesn't exist.

302
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:16,083
Speaker 1: I don't.

303
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,190
Speaker 1: Does RCA still exist?

304
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,952
Speaker 1: Yes.

305
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:18,757
Speaker 1: Really?

306
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:19,139
Speaker 1: Yes.

307
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:19,742
Speaker 1: I don't know.

308
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:20,345
Speaker 1: But there's lots of.

309
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:22,395
Speaker 1: there's lots of brands that don't exist anymore.

310
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:25,368
Speaker 1: But for a while now, in recent history.

311
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:25,830
Speaker 1: Right.

312
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:28,180
Speaker 1: Very few brands have died.

313
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,720
Speaker 1: I think the last brand I can remember dying, at least major one, was like MCI.

314
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:33,713
Speaker 1: You know, can you remember one more reason than that?

315
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:34,195
Speaker 1: You know what?

316
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:37,712
Speaker 0: Actually, I still call MCI all the time.

317
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:40,102
Speaker 0: We have a lot of MCI circuits.

318
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:40,805
Speaker 1: Really?

319
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:40,905
Speaker 1: Yeah.

320
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:42,231
Speaker 1: I thought they were dead.

321
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:42,994
Speaker 0: They are dead.

322
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:43,576
Speaker 1: OK.

323
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:44,841
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's like.

324
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:57,540
Speaker 1: I think that we do need to have sort of a, you know, a reminder, you know, I think it would have a good psychological helping to society if we realize that, you know, these brands aren't like, you know, permanent.

325
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,265
Speaker 0: But the brands basically are permanent because bankruptcy doesn't mean Chrysler disappears.

326
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:05,889
Speaker 0: Bankruptcy means Chrysler doesn't have to pay a lot of its debts and will reappear.

327
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:06,693
Speaker 1: I know.

328
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:07,095
Speaker 1: I know.

329
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:07,718
Speaker 1: But it's still.

330
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,553
Speaker 1: it's just to show that these things are vulnerable.

331
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:18,009
Speaker 1: People think of these things as like, you know, like, like, like, like unmoving rocks, like, you know, things that are always there.

332
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:25,654
Speaker 1: You know, they don't even think about the moving to know that these things can move and change and aren't like, you know, 100 percent stable, I think is how we'll see.

333
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,728
Speaker 0: No, I think we need a much more fundamental change.

334
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:36,338
Speaker 0: And my fear is that if only Chrysler goes down like this and Ford is probably going to pull through and, you know, all this stuff's going on, I feel like we're not going to change.

335
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:50,110
Speaker 0: the fundamental problem that why do we make an incrementally better car every year and then have this whole like there's such a drive to get people to constantly buy new cars when now my 98 Sunfire is going pretty strong?

336
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:57,756
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, people are talking a lot about this is that there is sort of like these rules of society that and we sort of treat them like their laws of physics.

337
00:15:57,777 --> 00:16:01,478
Speaker 1: We don't even think about changing them because they've become so ingrained.

338
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:12,626
Speaker 1: But really, we can you know, there are things like you don't even question, like, why do you have, you know, like one model of every type of class of car for every brand?

339
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:15,418
Speaker 1: Why do you make a new model every single year?

340
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,790
Speaker 1: Why, you know, why do you do it this way?

341
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:19,218
Speaker 1: You can do it differently.

342
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:21,492
Speaker 1: There's no law saying you have to do it that way.

343
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:23,263
Speaker 0: You can do whatever the hell you want.

344
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:24,793
Speaker 0: I mean, we see this in everything.

345
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:25,417
Speaker 0: You're all geeks.

346
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:26,364
Speaker 0: Look at anime cons.

347
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:38,173
Speaker 0: People start a new anime convention and they look at all the other conventions, say, well, I got to have a cosplay and I got to have some video rooms and I got to have the fan parodies and I got to have the cosplay ball and I got to have this and that.

348
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:45,652
Speaker 0: And people just it's very rare to see anything kind of break away from the mold if there is an established mold already in place.

349
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:46,215
Speaker 1: Yeah.

350
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:58,913
Speaker 1: I mean, why can't you have, say, an anime convention that's outside and is just one big thing and there's only one event and there's one schedule and everyone does all these things together and that's it.

351
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:02,998
Speaker 1: And this food, you know, it could be like that's like nothing like anime conventions are now.

352
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:06,454
Speaker 1: But if it's about anime, why is it still an anime convention?

353
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,184
Speaker 1: It's a gathering of anime folks.

354
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:13,209
Speaker 0: But everything in the car thing really bothers me just because a lot of cars like.

355
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,787
Speaker 0: I look at them and I wonder who the hell's buying these cars.

356
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,558
Speaker 0: I guess the answer was no one.

357
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,866
Speaker 0: And that's why Chrysler is going out.

358
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:19,107
Speaker 1: Yeah.

359
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,859
Speaker 1: And the other thing is you look around.

360
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,102
Speaker 1: Right.

361
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:28,279
Speaker 1: And there are certain car models that are bought in crazy numbers like Honda Civic Toyota, Corolla Mazda three.

362
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:30,028
Speaker 1: Mazda three is not bought in that crazy.

363
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:32,159
Speaker 0: It's still bought a lot.

364
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,324
Speaker 1: It's a very popular car.

365
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,390
Speaker 1: Not as popular as the other two.

366
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:34,771
Speaker 1: Right.

367
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,205
Speaker 1: And there are other cars that are hardly bought.

368
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:44,149
Speaker 1: You know, like you hardly ever see like, I don't know, Pontiac Solstice.

369
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:44,389
Speaker 1: Right.

370
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,234
Speaker 1: When do you see one of those?

371
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:48,755
Speaker 0: You know what those guys like once a month, you got part of.

372
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:49,703
Speaker 0: that is where we live.

373
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:50,388
Speaker 0: Look at where we live.

374
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:51,193
Speaker 0: We live in New York.

375
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:51,656
Speaker 0: I know.

376
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:52,099
Speaker 0: I know.

377
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,954
Speaker 0: Go to the Midwest and you see a total like when I was in high school.

378
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:55,196
Speaker 0: Right.

379
00:17:55,678 --> 00:18:00,421
Speaker 0: I drove a laser and the popular car in the area was a duster, a duster.

380
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,168
Speaker 0: Everyone had a duster.

381
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,213
Speaker 1: What's a duster?

382
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:04,158
Speaker 0: Pretty crappy car.

383
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:04,983
Speaker 1: I never even heard of one.

384
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:08,480
Speaker 0: Anyway, I had my laser and a lot of people had lasers.

385
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:13,425
Speaker 0: And when I left Michigan, I've seen like two lasers ever since I left Michigan.

386
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,792
Speaker 1: It's like, you look at Ford, right?

387
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:22,719
Speaker 1: Ford makes, let's see if I can name all their cars, but it's like, they've got, you know, a Mustang, they've got the focus, they've got, uh, the tourist equivalent.

388
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,006
Speaker 1: I think they changed the name of it.

389
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:26,439
Speaker 1: They got like three or four different trucks.

390
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,887
Speaker 1: They got vans, they got right.

391
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:29,918
Speaker 1: Why do you, you know, I mean, sure.

392
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:37,713
Speaker 1: Every one of those types of vehicles is needed by someone, but why does every single car brand have to have one car in every class?

393
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,462
Speaker 1: I mean, is it really necessary?

394
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:41,333
Speaker 0: Well, even more, I noticed something.

395
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:43,005
Speaker 1: I guess Mazda sort of breaks the mold.

396
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:44,272
Speaker 1: They don't have any vans.

397
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:50,398
Speaker 1: that, you know, I think they have like a, an SUV, a convertible, a normal car and a race car.

398
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,515
Speaker 0: Well, one thing I noticed come kind of to the side, but it struck me suddenly that I was kind of thinking about buying a new car and I'm poking around.

399
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:03,544
Speaker 0: And when I was a kid, I knew every make and model of car and I knew who made what, like.

400
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:05,938
Speaker 0: I knew it all, like every single car that was a production.

401
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:09,376
Speaker 0: I know a bunch, but I don't know all, but I used to know all.

402
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:19,086
Speaker 0: And I realized the reason I did is I watched TV and you know, I listened to the radio and everything and there's a lot of car advertising seems to be the primary advertising.

403
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:20,755
Speaker 0: There are more car ads than everything else.

404
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:21,380
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

405
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,863
Speaker 0: And you'd always, you know, the Ford, like a rock, cars, soft drinks, banks.

406
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:28,208
Speaker 1: That's like the big ads.

407
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:31,002
Speaker 0: They just like Ford focus just sounded right.

408
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:35,705
Speaker 0: But it only sounded right because I heard Ford focus in the background from these commercials forever.

409
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:41,804
Speaker 0: So now, you know, I haven't watched TV in like seven years really.

410
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:45,276
Speaker 0: And I don't use, yeah, yeah.

411
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:53,870
Speaker 0: From, from 2000, it has been nine years since I had cable TV or watched any appreciable amount of TV radio block ads on the internet.

412
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,978
Speaker 0: So I like the solstice.

413
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,243
Speaker 0: I didn't know it existed.

414
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:00,197
Speaker 1: I knew it existed only because I saw one on the street.

415
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,570
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't really, I'd see cars.

416
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,614
Speaker 0: I didn't exist anymore.

417
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:08,218
Speaker 0: Pontiac's gone, but I didn't know the Pontiac's gone, gone, or I'd see it.

418
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:13,409
Speaker 0: Saturn's probably, maybe I'd see something like a solstice, but unless I looked for the logo, I wouldn't know who made it.

419
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:14,195
Speaker 0: I didn't have that.

420
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,947
Speaker 1: Whenever I see a car I've never seen before.

421
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,879
Speaker 1: I always try to, I try to see what it is.

422
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:22,104
Speaker 0: See, the other thing that helped was when I stopped driving and just started taking the train.

423
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:23,613
Speaker 0: every day, I stopped seeing cars.

424
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:24,336
Speaker 1: That's true too.

425
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:32,178
Speaker 0: But I wonder if, you know, we're, you know, the affluent 20 something demographic, the demographic that is the most sought after in the world.

426
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:42,827
Speaker 0: And yet at the same time, the most difficult to advertise to, I think our demographic more and more is disconnected from advertising and isn't affected by car advertising as much.

427
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:58,804
Speaker 0: And as a result, probably at least in theory, spend a little bit more time researching because we don't know when we buy cars and we'll probably gravitate toward cars that our friends have bought or that I don't know, we found online on some blog or something.

428
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,715
Speaker 1: Maybe like two of our friends bought Honda fits.

429
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:02,927
Speaker 0: You know, I didn't know the Honda fit existed.

430
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:06,328
Speaker 1: I knew it existed and I probably would have bought it if it was available.

431
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:11,355
Speaker 0: You know, when I bought my car, which it wasn't, it wasn't out until he drove up with this car.

432
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:12,684
Speaker 0: And I'm like, what kind of car is this?

433
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,832
Speaker 0: He's like a Honda fit.

434
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:16,147
Speaker 0: And I look online and it's a pretty damn good car.

435
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:16,610
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

436
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,151
Speaker 0: Yeah.

437
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:18,456
Speaker 0: It's very nice.

438
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:19,861
Speaker 0: And Honda's doing okay.

439
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:20,564
Speaker 0: Yeah.

440
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:28,922
Speaker 1: But yeah, I think that, you know, why do we need, you know, I mean, I'm all for, you know, individuality, customization, right?

441
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:30,067
Speaker 1: Personalization all.

442
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:35,752
Speaker 1: I mean, I bought custom sunglasses, a custom messenger bag, you know, custom everything, right?

443
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:46,704
Speaker 1: But is it really necessary with something as big and as expensive as cars to have so many different ones, especially when many of them are so unpopular or so rarely used?

444
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:50,062
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't help that cars themselves are not terribly customizable.

445
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:50,625
Speaker 0: Yeah.

446
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:51,712
Speaker 0: Partly due to manufacturing.

447
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:52,054
Speaker 0: They are.

448
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:55,432
Speaker 0: If you're a ricer, I don't think that's not custom.

449
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:56,577
Speaker 0: That's something special.

450
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:56,678
Speaker 0: Yeah.

451
00:21:57,743 --> 00:22:03,497
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, Sion tried to do that, you know, the shtick where they were trying to market their cars as being customizable to racers.

452
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:04,661
Speaker 0: Yeah.

453
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:05,444
Speaker 0: But how did that go?

454
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:07,714
Speaker 1: Some people are buying them.

455
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:08,156
Speaker 0: Yeah.

456
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:08,919
Speaker 0: Yeah.

457
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:14,933
Speaker 0: I just, I, I kind of wonder what's going to happen to my home state of Michigan because things are not going well in Michigan.

458
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:18,287
Speaker 1: It's going to be an awesome airsoft paintball arena.

459
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:28,689
Speaker 0: No, because if you're in the dot and you're in downtown Detroit in like some factory, abandoned factory playing airsoft, God's hour, someone with a real gun is going to want to join in on the fun.

460
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,190
Speaker 1: It's all right.

461
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:40,220
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day, let's get this going.

462
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:48,182
Speaker 0: So I have a dream that the MLK estate is going to stop trying to sue people who do things with Martin Luther King's speeches and images.

463
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:52,639
Speaker 0: And I'm pretty sure that this is fair use.

464
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,746
Speaker 0: And if it isn't, it should be.

465
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,076
Speaker 0: But I like this.

466
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:55,982
Speaker 0: So it's my thing of the day.

467
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:10,679
Speaker 0: It's a, there was this thing on college humor of charge Hill giving his speeches run through the Britney Spears filter, which is basically you can, it's pretty easy to take a mediocre singer and run pitch shift shifting to make them sound like a really good.

468
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,000
Speaker 1: Well, don't you have to tell the shifter like what the song is to a degree?

469
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,189
Speaker 0: I mean, there's different ways to do it.

470
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,683
Speaker 1: It doesn't just work for any singing.

471
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:18,599
Speaker 1: You have to like, tell it like, you know, what the notes are.

472
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,585
Speaker 0: Not necessarily.

473
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,137
Speaker 0: I mean, it depends on what you're trying to do.

474
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:24,320
Speaker 0: One way to do it is to give it a key and all the key changes.

475
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:31,725
Speaker 0: So what key it's in at a given time, and then you just sing as close as you can and it'll match you to what note you probably should be singing.

476
00:23:32,772 --> 00:23:34,000
Speaker 0: And then there are all different ways to do it.

477
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,753
Speaker 0: It's really complex, interesting, cool software.

478
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:36,418
Speaker 0: And you can do it live.

479
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,247
Speaker 0: You can do it after the fact, but someone did a mediocre job with Churchill and it was pretty good.

480
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,069
Speaker 0: Someone then did a pretty awesome job with Martin Luther King Jr's.

481
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,014
Speaker 0: I have a dream speech.

482
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:54,434
Speaker 0: They kind of made this techno E remix music video thing that honestly is kind of inspiring and is kind of touching to watch.

483
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:55,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty good.

484
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,900
Speaker 0: I highly recommend you watch it and maybe someday we'll talk more about that sort of software because I think it's neat.

485
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:02,689
Speaker 1: Or the Martin Luther King estate.

486
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:03,392
Speaker 0: Yeah.

487
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:04,036
Speaker 0: Yeah.

488
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:13,983
Speaker 0: I've talked about them before, so I don't want to belabor the point, but when was the last time we had someone in the US who was as memorable and important as Martin Luther King

489
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:14,345
Speaker 0: Jr.?

490
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:15,772
Speaker 0: Yeah.

491
00:24:15,993 --> 00:24:18,366
Speaker 1: I mean, I started discussing this like a few minutes ago.

492
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:19,533
Speaker 1: It sort of came to me, right?

493
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:20,680
Speaker 1: Like who today?

494
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:29,074
Speaker 1: Can you think of a single person alive today who you could conceive of ever having a federal holiday for them?

495
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,599
Speaker 0: Wait, having or should have?

496
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,104
Speaker 1: You know, should have.

497
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:33,108
Speaker 0: Uh, Dallaire.

498
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:36,243
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, a United States federal holiday.

499
00:24:36,263 --> 00:24:38,413
Speaker 0: Uh, it still should be Dallaire.

500
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:40,381
Speaker 1: You know what I'm saying?

501
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:41,948
Speaker 1: Like who alive?

502
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:45,784
Speaker 1: I mean, like even Obama, who is historically significant.

503
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:48,798
Speaker 1: Should there really be a Barack Obama day?

504
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:49,320
Speaker 0: We have to wait.

505
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:50,989
Speaker 0: He needs more time.

506
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:53,984
Speaker 0: He hasn't, he's only, he's only been president like a hundred days.

507
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:54,345
Speaker 0: Yeah.

508
00:24:54,365 --> 00:24:57,017
Speaker 1: But I mean, not really, probably not.

509
00:24:57,118 --> 00:24:57,359
Speaker 1: Right.

510
00:24:57,439 --> 00:25:02,602
Speaker 1: So, you know what, who, who alive then should ever have a federal holiday for them?

511
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:03,930
Speaker 1: There's no one like that.

512
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:06,504
Speaker 1: People like that I think are, don't exist anymore.

513
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:14,988
Speaker 1: And I think that's part of the, the reason why we can't, you know, make changes happen because you know, there's, we don't have those kinds of people around.

514
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:22,815
Speaker 0: See, is it really a matter of not having these people or is it just a matter of expectations and perceptions changing coupled with the fact that media is more diffuse?

515
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:28,503
Speaker 1: Well, I think that, you know, it could be that those things are the cause of not having the people.

516
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:31,743
Speaker 1: And it's sort of a reciprocal situation, sort of catch 22, perhaps.

517
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:32,105
Speaker 1: Yeah.

518
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:32,769
Speaker 1: Something like that.

519
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:44,026
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, I blame partly on the fact that if there was a big, united, strong movement of ideas and enough people agreeing on something awesome, then you know that that person just emerges.

520
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:51,283
Speaker 1: or, you know, is it that you need that person to make it emerge when it's, you know, where the, the movement is there, but hidden?

521
00:25:51,303 --> 00:26:05,311
Speaker 0: I think part of it honestly, is that a lot of these old historical figures, we have the long great speech that they gave, especially in this era where there was video of this speech, but before we got into the TV, Twitter soundbite era.

522
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:12,675
Speaker 0: So you've got eloquent speakers writing literary, intelligent, engaging speeches.

523
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:15,709
Speaker 0: We had orators and there aren't that many orders anymore.

524
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,720
Speaker 0: And well, no, no, I take that back.

525
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,776
Speaker 0: There are orders, but people don't give a shit anymore.

526
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:23,894
Speaker 1: Well, if you, you go to Ted, that's, that's where I get my oration.

527
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:24,357
Speaker 0: Yeah.

528
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,186
Speaker 0: But how popular is Ted?

529
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:27,633
Speaker 1: popular among smart people?

530
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:27,974
Speaker 1: Yeah.

531
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:28,175
Speaker 0: Yeah.

532
00:26:28,215 --> 00:26:28,517
Speaker 0: Yeah.

533
00:26:28,898 --> 00:26:29,682
Speaker 0: Watch that videos.

534
00:26:29,924 --> 00:26:30,427
Speaker 1: I've been watched.

535
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:31,231
Speaker 1: I subscribe to.

536
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,720
Speaker 1: Ted is a video podcast now.

537
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,072
Speaker 1: So I'm just watching all of them on the iPhone or whatever.

538
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:37,163
Speaker 1: That's the way to go.

539
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:41,078
Speaker 0: I'm seriously considering just paying and joining and going.

540
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:42,987
Speaker 1: It's like a bajillion dollars.

541
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:46,446
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about it's like a quarter of your monies a year.

542
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:47,351
Speaker 0: There are different levels.

543
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:50,871
Speaker 1: You realize really isn't, but I've seen tickets go on eBay for like $25,000.

544
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:53,930
Speaker 0: Well, there are different levels of sponsorship.

545
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,808
Speaker 0: Some of those levels do not involve going, at least not right away.

546
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,247
Speaker 1: Well then why would I pay if I'm not going to get other stuff?

547
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:01,736
Speaker 1: I can see it all for free.

548
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:03,386
Speaker 1: I'm not going to pay unless I get to go.

549
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,338
Speaker 0: You don't want to support the Ted organization.

550
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:06,547
Speaker 1: I would like to support them.

551
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:07,635
Speaker 1: I support them by watching.

552
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:10,090
Speaker 1: And by watching, I increase their numbers because they have ads.

553
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:13,832
Speaker 0: I did learn how to nominate people to get a Ted talk.

554
00:27:13,852 --> 00:27:15,602
Speaker 1: Don't you have to be a Ted person already?

555
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:16,126
Speaker 1: No.

556
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:17,655
Speaker 1: Then you can nominate someone else.

557
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,737
Speaker 1: Well, you can know, it's sort of a, you know, invite only inside out thing.

558
00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:23,105
Speaker 0: No, you can just dominate people.

559
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:23,790
Speaker 1: Okay.

560
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:25,601
Speaker 0: And there's all this stuff you have to fill out.

561
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:26,788
Speaker 0: It's a pretty intense form.

562
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:31,274
Speaker 0: And the thing is, I can't think of anyone worthy who hasn't already given one that I know of.

563
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:31,757
Speaker 1: Yeah.

564
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:33,908
Speaker 1: We tend to not know those kinds of people.

565
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,986
Speaker 0: And I thought for a second, Oh, I'll nominate myself.

566
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:39,773
Speaker 0: And that, that felt so sleazy.

567
00:27:40,316 --> 00:27:40,557
Speaker 1: Yeah.

568
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:44,898
Speaker 1: The thing is you compare yourself to like even the lowliest person at Ted.

569
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:46,286
Speaker 1: It's like not even close.

570
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:47,392
Speaker 0: I'm just like a lowly worm.

571
00:27:47,553 --> 00:27:47,895
Speaker 1: Yeah.

572
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:51,855
Speaker 1: It's anyway, my thing of the day, some guy made this cool website.

573
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:55,995
Speaker 1: He's got penguin books, science fiction covers, uh, through the years.

574
00:27:56,015 --> 00:28:01,686
Speaker 1: So you can go year by year and look at like all the book covers and see the art of them and how it changed.

575
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:04,843
Speaker 1: And it's a, it's a very good, a lesson in design.

576
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:07,096
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of cool book covers going on.

577
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:08,363
Speaker 1: It's very, very nice.

578
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:10,030
Speaker 1: I like this kind of action.

579
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:12,602
Speaker 0: So I can't believe, Oh, you have more to say?

580
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:14,712
Speaker 1: No, I just like, I like book covers a lot.

581
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:16,602
Speaker 0: Gabe would like.

582
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:21,187
Speaker 1: it has a lot of, uh, spaceships, you know, with a planet and a rocket kind of like how.

583
00:28:21,247 --> 00:28:24,040
Speaker 0: I really like old video game box cover art.

584
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:24,662
Speaker 0: Yeah.

585
00:28:24,722 --> 00:28:24,964
Speaker 0: Right.

586
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:28,344
Speaker 0: And I don't like new video game box cover art because all looks the same.

587
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:29,470
Speaker 0: Hmm.

588
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:31,559
Speaker 0: I mean, remember like mega man too.

589
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,565
Speaker 0: Like there was a, uh, anyway, so people have been asking us to do how to not suck episodes again.

590
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:42,851
Speaker 0: And independently of that, people have suggested that we do food episodes again.

591
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:51,404
Speaker 1: I don't know what you people, what it is with eating, chew your food, swallow, use the utensils properly.

592
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,528
Speaker 0: Don't eat too much.

593
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:53,653
Speaker 1: Don't eat too much.

594
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,545
Speaker 0: Eat mostly plants and grain, which are plants.

595
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:57,450
Speaker 0: Yes.

596
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,133
Speaker 0: A little bit of meat.

597
00:28:58,616 --> 00:28:58,817
Speaker 1: Yep.

598
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:04,620
Speaker 1: Not so much trans fat, zero trans fat, but specifically you can eat sugar though.

599
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:09,056
Speaker 0: Someone suggested to do a show on how to not suck at eating out.

600
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:18,731
Speaker 0: And I was intrigued by this because I didn't think people had trouble, but no, the thing is you didn't think people had trouble, but then I think no, I have proof that people have trouble.

601
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,884
Speaker 1: I actually think about my experiences.

602
00:29:20,964 --> 00:29:24,080
Speaker 1: And I realize a lot of people who aren't me have trouble.

603
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:30,934
Speaker 0: You want to, uh, you want absolute proof that people have difficulty eating out properly drive by a cracker barrel.

604
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:33,183
Speaker 0: There are people in that parking lot.

605
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:34,929
Speaker 0: There are cars parked there.

606
00:29:34,949 --> 00:29:35,632
Speaker 0: A lot of them.

607
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:39,726
Speaker 0: Well, I'll qualify that there are cars parked there after 1130 AM.

608
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:40,067
Speaker 0: All right.

609
00:29:45,622 --> 00:29:49,500
Speaker 1: So rule number one, don't go to fast food unless you have no choice.

610
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:50,223
Speaker 0: Yeah.

611
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:50,565
Speaker 1: Yeah.

612
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:56,239
Speaker 1: I mean, a lot of people out there, you might love you some McDonald's, but you're basically just poisoning yourself to death.

613
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:58,231
Speaker 1: I mean, it's as bad as, you know, smoking.

614
00:29:58,573 --> 00:30:04,304
Speaker 1: So just don't, don't eat there ever unless you, you know, you're hungry and there's absolutely nothing else you can do.

615
00:30:04,364 --> 00:30:08,365
Speaker 0: I won't quite take that tack because as a kid, I had a lot of fast food.

616
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,391
Speaker 0: Yeah.

617
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:19,054
Speaker 0: You know how many times I ate at Arby's and got like some chicken strips and every day in the summer when I was like a sophomore or junior in high school, I would get in my car.

618
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:20,762
Speaker 0: I drive to Arby's.

619
00:30:21,144 --> 00:30:27,230
Speaker 0: I get like curly fries and like the biggest sandwich, the big Montana and a Jamoca shake.

620
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:33,305
Speaker 1: One, one, uh, I remember my dad picked me up from summer camp once and we went to Arby's on the way home and he had the big Montana.

621
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:43,279
Speaker 1: And then he got sick where I always had, you know, every time I went there, I always got, you know, the chicken, whatever the curly fries and a shake, but the key, I am too smart.

622
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,485
Speaker 1: I do not go there anymore.

623
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:46,073
Speaker 0: The key was the Jamoca shake.

624
00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:50,855
Speaker 0: I got a shake and I would eat a Taco Bell pretty often.

625
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:54,530
Speaker 0: I'll still occasionally eat a Taco Bell if I'm desperate.

626
00:30:55,313 --> 00:31:00,573
Speaker 0: I guess I've got a hierarchy now where there's this waiting of how desperate am I?

627
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:01,998
Speaker 0: What's nearby?

628
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:06,718
Speaker 0: And the more desperate I am, the further I'll go or the lower I'll go.

629
00:31:06,738 --> 00:31:06,798
Speaker 1: Yes.

630
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:10,602
Speaker 1: But the thing is it, I have to be quite desperate to go to like a subway.

631
00:31:10,623 --> 00:31:22,462
Speaker 0: I had to be even more desperate to go someplace like, you know, a burger, you know, I think my order is pretty much at the top of the fast food chain is the like, well, White Castle because White Castle is awesome.

632
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:26,985
Speaker 1: The top are the places that are sort of like not quite fast food, right?

633
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:31,706
Speaker 1: Like a quiz nose or like a five guys or, you know, those, those sorts of things.

634
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:32,008
Speaker 1: Right.

635
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,028
Speaker 1: And then you got subways sort of like the barrier, right?

636
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:36,920
Speaker 1: Cause it's sort of like, it's actually a sandwich.

637
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:37,785
Speaker 1: You go there, right?

638
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:42,496
Speaker 1: I like, they got that nice, the chicken teriyaki sandwich where like they microwave a little bit of chicken.

639
00:31:42,577 --> 00:31:43,804
Speaker 0: It's not really bad for you.

640
00:31:43,824 --> 00:31:45,151
Speaker 0: Cause it's just bread and lettuce.

641
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:56,539
Speaker 1: You know, then they got like a chocolate chip cookie, which is just a chocolate, you know, then at least their food isn't like full of trans fat and nasty, horrible chemicals, you know, it's just normal, cheap sandwich.

642
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:59,737
Speaker 0: But I think going down the line, it's a Arby's, but only the chicken.

643
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:00,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

644
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,841
Speaker 1: Arby's I, you know, I just, not that Arby's is any healthier than the others.

645
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:06,130
Speaker 1: I just sort of like it more.

646
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,440
Speaker 1: So I'm more willing to eat there.

647
00:32:08,581 --> 00:32:12,305
Speaker 1: Cause you know, it's like, well, it's just as poisonous as McDonald's, but I like it more.

648
00:32:12,426 --> 00:32:15,643
Speaker 1: So it goes, and then you got like a Wendy's a little bit better.

649
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:19,702
Speaker 0: Wendy's really only for the dollar menu and those, uh, uh, frosty.

650
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:21,171
Speaker 1: You get the chicken nuggets are okay.

651
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:21,694
Speaker 1: There you go.

652
00:32:21,714 --> 00:32:23,785
Speaker 0: They have vanilla Frosty's now.

653
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:24,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

654
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:25,713
Speaker 0: That's crazy.

655
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:26,095
Speaker 1: It is.

656
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:28,084
Speaker 0: I had one really at the airport.

657
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:28,446
Speaker 0: Wow.

658
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:31,059
Speaker 0: And you know what, you know, it was in it Oreos.

659
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:32,762
Speaker 1: Damn.

660
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:37,610
Speaker 1: And then, you know, you start going down a little bit and you, I think the bottom is Jack in the box.

661
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:45,099
Speaker 1: I think the bottom is like those really nasty places like Burger King and Burger King KFC, right?

662
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:47,392
Speaker 1: Those sorts of really, really nasty shit.

663
00:32:47,472 --> 00:32:47,593
Speaker 0: Yeah.

664
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,303
Speaker 0: McDonald's is even above Burger King.

665
00:32:49,423 --> 00:32:54,932
Speaker 1: McDonald's is sort of like the barrier between like fast food and the terrible fast food.

666
00:32:55,052 --> 00:33:01,145
Speaker 0: It's weird though, because McDonald's and I'm not the only one, a lot of people agree with me, the breakfast, not that bad.

667
00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:13,793
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I won't eat the breakfast like on purpose, you know, but I mean, it's, it's edible, but it's weird how McDonald's breakfast rates a lot higher than most other fast food places, but McDonald's anything else now?

668
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:16,872
Speaker 1: I think that I just have an advantage of being in New York city.

669
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:18,826
Speaker 1: You can just go to any deli and get a breakfast sandwich.

670
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:20,582
Speaker 1: So why would you go to McDonald's to get a breakfast?

671
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:27,644
Speaker 0: Oh no, I only get breakfast sandwiches if I'm in like some other heathen city and it doesn't have like a deli and ask for a breakfast sandwich.

672
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:28,310
Speaker 1: You know what they do?

673
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:29,298
Speaker 1: They take two eggs.

674
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,607
Speaker 1: They break them on the griddle.

675
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:31,855
Speaker 1: They take some bacon.

676
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:32,942
Speaker 1: They put it on the griddle.

677
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:36,003
Speaker 1: They take a Thomas English muffin, just like from the grocery store.

678
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,840
Speaker 1: They take a piece of cheese, just like from the grocery store.

679
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:41,491
Speaker 1: They put it together and then you eat it.

680
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:42,094
Speaker 1: And it's like $2.

681
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:46,197
Speaker 1: And it's like, um, why would I go to McDonald's and get there?

682
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:53,595
Speaker 1: Like manufactured process stuff when I can go and get basically exactly like what I would make in my house for $2.

683
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:57,537
Speaker 0: But I've been in cities where there's just, there's nothing around and you're stuck.

684
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:58,100
Speaker 1: Yeah.

685
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,092
Speaker 1: That's it's basically middle of nowhere.

686
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:05,397
Speaker 0: that like when I was in a Columbia in Columbia, where, uh, it's near DC.

687
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:09,645
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was actually in Maryland or what, or how about when we were at Silicon, right?

688
00:34:09,705 --> 00:34:12,482
Speaker 1: They had one fancy restaurant, that Italian place, right?

689
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:15,252
Speaker 1: And then there was a Wendy's and a Denny's.

690
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:18,866
Speaker 1: It's like, well, we don't have much choice.

691
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:21,803
Speaker 0: We ate at that Denny's with, uh, entertainment system.

692
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:22,226
Speaker 0: We did.

693
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,387
Speaker 0: And that was when we learned that they're all kind of jerks and they all smoke.

694
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,904
Speaker 1: Well, one guy, the guy who played Pokemon was okay.

695
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:30,844
Speaker 0: He was cool, but everyone else was just kind of, kind of, kind of bitches.

696
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:31,507
Speaker 1: Yeah.

697
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,873
Speaker 0: I just, it was weird.

698
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:35,286
Speaker 0: I remember that very in stark detail.

699
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:36,192
Speaker 1: It was kind of weird.

700
00:34:36,212 --> 00:34:37,077
Speaker 1: Yeah.

701
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:42,590
Speaker 0: Anyway, but we don't want to just talk about fast food, but talk about actual sitting down food.

702
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:43,353
Speaker 0: Yeah.

703
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:45,967
Speaker 0: Uh, don't go to stuff on the walls, restaurants either.

704
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:48,103
Speaker 0: They're, they're all the same and they're not good.

705
00:34:48,163 --> 00:34:50,534
Speaker 1: Friday's Ruby Tuesday, et cetera, et cetera.

706
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:51,197
Speaker 1: Right.

707
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:52,364
Speaker 1: All of those plays.

708
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:54,905
Speaker 1: I mean, there are restaurants that have stuff on the walls that are okay.

709
00:34:54,985 --> 00:34:56,192
Speaker 1: Like, uh, fun rockers.

710
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:57,600
Speaker 0: It's a sliding scale.

711
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:04,980
Speaker 0: Like I think the top, top, top of the equivalent of a stuff on the walls is the Outback because that's equivalent to a stuff on the walls.

712
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:07,178
Speaker 0: I say, yeah, it is the kind of food you get.

713
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:12,188
Speaker 0: I mean, Outback is definitely a stuff on the walls, but I feel like it is the pinnacle of stuff on the walls.

714
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:17,016
Speaker 0: beyond that you're in a real restaurant and below that you're at Ruby Tuesday getting the runs.

715
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:17,539
Speaker 1: Yeah.

716
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:27,516
Speaker 1: I mean, the main problem with the stuff on the walls restaurants is that almost everything on the menu, not everything, you know, but almost everything is the quadra effect of it's either.

717
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:29,586
Speaker 1: it's either cool range, right?

718
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:32,499
Speaker 1: It's like bacon, cheese, cool ranch, et cetera.

719
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:32,740
Speaker 1: Right.

720
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,166
Speaker 1: And, or mayonnaise.

721
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:43,016
Speaker 1: And it's like every meal is either the same as the other ones, uh, not good fried or that's it, you know?

722
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:49,332
Speaker 1: So it's, it's not good to eat there, especially considering, you know, those places aren't too cheap for the same price.

723
00:35:49,372 --> 00:35:52,530
Speaker 1: You can go to like a diner and get something better or, you know, good.

724
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:59,653
Speaker 1: Like, you know, any number of you can go to like an actual Italian restaurant for the same price as the stuff on the walls, what people often overlook.

725
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:02,929
Speaker 0: And here's, this is aimed primarily at college kids.

726
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:10,949
Speaker 0: If you want to eat and you don't have money and you got a bunch of friends, go to a stuff on the walls place and order nothing but appetizers.

727
00:36:11,351 --> 00:36:11,672
Speaker 1: Yeah.

728
00:36:11,973 --> 00:36:15,492
Speaker 1: Cause they always have mad appetizer deals at those kinds of places.

729
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:18,331
Speaker 0: Get yourself like four orders of fried mozzarella sticks.

730
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:18,874
Speaker 0: You're good to go.

731
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:19,478
Speaker 0: Yeah.

732
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:24,368
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like we would, uh, way back, we'd go to Applebee's, which is like a place you should never go.

733
00:36:24,388 --> 00:36:24,851
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

734
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,980
Speaker 0: After all the R wag meetings.

735
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,322
Speaker 0: Yeah.

736
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:30,231
Speaker 0: Because they gave you a half off on all the appetite when they gave us half off on the appetizers.

737
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:31,278
Speaker 1: Cause he went on Tuesday.

738
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:31,660
Speaker 1: Right.

739
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,846
Speaker 1: And we were in a large group.

740
00:36:33,348 --> 00:36:38,077
Speaker 1: So everyone would buy a ton of advertising, but then they realized what was going on.

741
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:38,962
Speaker 0: Cause we'd always show up.

742
00:36:38,982 --> 00:36:39,183
Speaker 0: Right.

743
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:46,515
Speaker 0: So it'd be like 20 to 30 people take over this Applebee's and everyone will order the nachos for like four bucks.

744
00:36:47,197 --> 00:36:56,211
Speaker 0: And the nachos cost them probably more than four bucks to make, because I remember after a couple of months of this, there was a little thing on the menu saying, does not apply to nachos.

745
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:56,915
Speaker 1: Yeah.

746
00:36:56,935 --> 00:37:02,502
Speaker 1: But even so you like cheese steaks and all sorts of, you know, fried, like a fried platter, all kinds of stuff.

747
00:37:02,562 --> 00:37:09,602
Speaker 0: Anyway, remember the Applebee's because we'll have to come back to the Applebee's because the Applebee's taught me a very important lesson.

748
00:37:09,884 --> 00:37:10,206
Speaker 1: Oh yes.

749
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:11,413
Speaker 1: That is the most important lesson.

750
00:37:11,434 --> 00:37:15,463
Speaker 1: I think it's the most important thing we have to teach tonight, but we'll come back to that at the end.

751
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:16,732
Speaker 0: Just remember Applebee's.

752
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:26,136
Speaker 0: we will return, but no, we're talking now about real fucking restaurants as in a restaurant that has a name and that name is not anywhere else yet.

753
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:28,003
Speaker 1: Oh, you know what I found out recently?

754
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:31,958
Speaker 1: Olive garden, Capitol grill, same company.

755
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:32,420
Speaker 0: Really?

756
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:32,740
Speaker 0: Yep.

757
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:33,927
Speaker 0: That's interesting to know.

758
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:34,268
Speaker 0: Yep.

759
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:38,930
Speaker 0: Well, I should qualify that there are restaurants that are changed, right?

760
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:43,613
Speaker 1: There are restaurants, you know, chain, you know, it's like a stuff on the walls is a chain, right?

761
00:37:44,497 --> 00:37:47,633
Speaker 1: But there are chains that are not stuff on the wall.

762
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,461
Speaker 0: Case in point, the Capitol grill, right?

763
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:56,474
Speaker 1: The Capitol grill is an actual, very fancy high class steakhouse, but it's also a chain there in many cities.

764
00:37:56,815 --> 00:37:57,077
Speaker 0: Yes.

765
00:37:57,137 --> 00:38:02,100
Speaker 0: Capitol grill is basically a New York city style steakhouse, but they're in other cities.

766
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:07,616
Speaker 0: So if you don't live in New York city, you can go to a Capitol grill and you'll find out what a New York city steakhouse is like.

767
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:07,958
Speaker 0: Yeah.

768
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:10,455
Speaker 1: I mean, there's one in New York, but there's one in Baltimore.

769
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:12,487
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's one in California somewhere.

770
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:14,176
Speaker 1: I got to go to the website.

771
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:14,941
Speaker 1: They list all of them.

772
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:18,542
Speaker 0: I got to tell you, I, we, we tricked a vendor into buying us lunch there one day.

773
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,330
Speaker 1: Did you, did you buy his stuff?

774
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:25,968
Speaker 1: No, he bought you steaks and you didn't buy anything from him.

775
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:27,338
Speaker 0: He didn't buy me just any steak.

776
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:34,269
Speaker 0: He bought me an inch and a half thick, like almost completely raw steak that was seared black on the outside.

777
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:38,548
Speaker 0: You know, it was seasoned with sugar, sugar, just sugar.

778
00:38:38,628 --> 00:38:39,312
Speaker 1: That's a good way to go.

779
00:38:39,432 --> 00:38:42,204
Speaker 0: That was the second best steak I've ever had in my life.

780
00:38:42,606 --> 00:38:43,910
Speaker 0: All right.

781
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:52,085
Speaker 1: So step one, when going to a real restaurant, deciding which real restaurant to go to, this is impossible in the front row crew.

782
00:38:52,688 --> 00:38:58,640
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the problem is, is whatever kind of restaurant you pick, which is usually associated with some nationality.

783
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:02,616
Speaker 1: If your group is too big, someone is going to veto, right?

784
00:39:03,198 --> 00:39:16,538
Speaker 1: So what you really basically have to do is if you're someone else is vetoing, you're basically going to have to sort of screw someone, you know, and if they can't deal with that, then, you know, just get rid of them.

785
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:18,289
Speaker 1: Tell them to save the drama for someone else.

786
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,692
Speaker 0: Really the simplest way about this is you should be able to eat.

787
00:39:21,752 --> 00:39:22,236
Speaker 0: And you know what?

788
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,424
Speaker 1: That's what I was just about to say.

789
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:23,787
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

790
00:39:23,807 --> 00:39:24,311
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait.

791
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:25,802
Speaker 0: I'm going to go one step further.

792
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:31,838
Speaker 0: You can eat at any kind of restaurant because like we have friends who say like, oh, they don't want to eat at Indian places.

793
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:39,093
Speaker 0: But if you look at the menu, there is stuff that anyone will eat on every menu of just about every restaurant in the world.

794
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:45,766
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, there are some people who are like crazy picky, like, you know, I mean, this picky, like, oh, I don't want that.

795
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:46,330
Speaker 1: I don't want that.

796
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,560
Speaker 1: But there's crazy picky.

797
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,244
Speaker 1: Like I know people who literally they eat like chicken and French fries and that is it.

798
00:39:51,547 --> 00:40:00,244
Speaker 0: Well, I remember for the longest time, your brother was like that where I go visit you at your house and your parents would make like awesome steaks and they'd make your brother a chicken filet because that's all he would eat.

799
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:01,532
Speaker 1: He's better than that now.

800
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:08,288
Speaker 1: But I mean, there are people I know who exist that are like like that and are older than us, like 30 or 40 something.

801
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:09,456
Speaker 0: Not in the front row crew, though.

802
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:10,482
Speaker 1: No, not the front row crew.

803
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:14,356
Speaker 1: But, you know, so you think about yourself.

804
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:18,397
Speaker 1: You should be able to eat at any restaurant, no matter what restaurant is picked.

805
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,926
Speaker 1: You might not be in the mood.

806
00:40:19,946 --> 00:40:22,199
Speaker 1: It might not be the best, but there should.

807
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,197
Speaker 1: if you're hungry, there will be something there for you to eat.

808
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:29,583
Speaker 1: You have to be, you know, you have to be able to accept that and be willing to go anywhere.

809
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:35,014
Speaker 1: You know, you can have a preference, but you should never sort of had to, you know, completely object.

810
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:38,550
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, like I always I never want to go to the Indian restaurant.

811
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:43,475
Speaker 1: But when we go, I go and I eat something, you know, it doesn't kill me.

812
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:45,787
Speaker 1: I think the mango is the reason you go.

813
00:40:45,807 --> 00:40:47,595
Speaker 1: Well, the mango is excellent.

814
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:52,174
Speaker 1: But, you know, there are places I would rather go, but I go anyway.

815
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:56,340
Speaker 1: You know, Scott Johnson doesn't like the cafe, Maya, because he doesn't like peppers and onions.

816
00:40:56,881 --> 00:41:01,080
Speaker 1: But he goes anyway because he's not, you know, well, he is.

817
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:04,287
Speaker 1: But he goes anyway.

818
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:08,386
Speaker 0: The real key is and this is always like the critical balance, not just in food, but in life.

819
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:14,029
Speaker 0: The careful choosing between the two opposite ends of this one spectrum.

820
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,138
Speaker 0: on the far left is adventure.

821
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:18,809
Speaker 0: On the far right is known goodness.

822
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:19,271
Speaker 0: Yep.

823
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:23,313
Speaker 1: I like you're obviously never going to go to a restaurant that you know is bad, right?

824
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:24,783
Speaker 1: We're assuming that right off the bat.

825
00:41:24,844 --> 00:41:30,498
Speaker 1: So there's restaurants you're familiar with that are good, which means you'll go to them or restaurants that are unknown.

826
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:31,363
Speaker 1: No one has been there.

827
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:39,926
Speaker 1: And the strategy is if you've never been to a restaurant, go with only a few people like maybe one or two because you want to go with more than once.

828
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:45,658
Speaker 1: You can try multiple dishes, but you don't want to go too many because if it sucks, you're wasting a lot of money.

829
00:41:45,698 --> 00:41:47,350
Speaker 0: This really only applies if you've got a crew.

830
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:54,487
Speaker 0: I mean, if the front row crew is together and we're going to a restaurant that is between 10 and 25 people at any given time.

831
00:41:54,507 --> 00:41:55,151
Speaker 1: That's a lot of people.

832
00:41:55,211 --> 00:42:01,544
Speaker 0: So if we take 20 people to a restaurant that no one's been to before and it sucks, 20 people got screwed.

833
00:42:01,564 --> 00:42:02,087
Speaker 1: That's right.

834
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:08,542
Speaker 0: So we'll send scouts ahead like Emily and I will go try a restaurant and we'll come back and be like, that place sucked.

835
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,712
Speaker 0: We're not going there ever again.

836
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:11,033
Speaker 1: Yeah.

837
00:42:11,636 --> 00:42:15,737
Speaker 1: So you got to test with a few people, but if it's known goodness, it's known goodness.

838
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:16,360
Speaker 0: Yes.

839
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:20,745
Speaker 0: Now, if you've got, you got to kind of in your local area, build up the list of standbys.

840
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:26,214
Speaker 0: You've got to have like five or six restaurants that are the standbys that you can always go to no matter what.

841
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:26,717
Speaker 1: Yep.

842
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:31,984
Speaker 0: And then you have the few special place, keep the hours of the restaurants in mind quite often.

843
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:39,370
Speaker 1: You know, if you don't know what the hours are, it might be like nine o'clock and you like, Hey, let's go to the something, something you forget that it's lunch only.

844
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,275
Speaker 1: You're like, Oh crap.

845
00:42:40,717 --> 00:42:41,842
Speaker 0: And then it's diner time.

846
00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:42,264
Speaker 0: Yup.

847
00:42:42,846 --> 00:42:43,408
Speaker 1: It's no good.

848
00:42:44,572 --> 00:42:46,158
Speaker 1: Um, secondly, you know what?

849
00:42:46,178 --> 00:42:50,642
Speaker 0: This applies to dishes too, because the cafe Maya has some of the best Mexican food ever.

850
00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:51,969
Speaker 0: Like that's, Oh my God.

851
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:52,692
Speaker 0: It's pretty.

852
00:42:52,813 --> 00:42:54,964
Speaker 1: I really, I haven't even found a place in the city.

853
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:55,747
Speaker 1: That's as good as that.

854
00:42:55,968 --> 00:43:08,155
Speaker 0: The cafe Maya in fish kill New York, but there's a couple of, there's one in Waffensters falls all expansions of it, but the central one in fish kill, like it is famous in the mid Hudson Valley as like this awesome place.

855
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:09,423
Speaker 1: It's fucking amazing.

856
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:13,352
Speaker 0: You want to eat there for dinner and like Saturday night, there's like an hour or two hour wait.

857
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,626
Speaker 1: I was just about to talk about weights, right?

858
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:16,009
Speaker 0: All right.

859
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:19,585
Speaker 0: You've got to be willing to fucking bail immediately, right?

860
00:43:19,685 --> 00:43:21,795
Speaker 1: When you show up at a restaurant, right?

861
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:27,782
Speaker 1: You have to already know before you even get there, how long you're willing to wait, right?

862
00:43:28,364 --> 00:43:35,797
Speaker 1: And if the wait time is longer than that, just get in your car and go, don't like stand around and do the hokey pokey.

863
00:43:35,837 --> 00:43:40,590
Speaker 1: Cause you're basically just, you know, you're basically screwing yourself by going to walk up and be like, how long's the wait?

864
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:43,589
Speaker 0: And if they say half hour and you're not willing to wait, you say, Oh, nevermind.

865
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:44,172
Speaker 0: Yup.

866
00:43:44,876 --> 00:43:53,037
Speaker 1: And when they say half hour, pretend they said 45 minutes, you know, if they say 45 minutes, pretend they said an hour, unless it's the sick of tie.

867
00:43:53,118 --> 00:43:54,366
Speaker 0: Fuck you sick of tie, right?

868
00:43:54,628 --> 00:43:57,787
Speaker 1: You know, if the restaurant won't tell you what the weight is, just leave.

869
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,193
Speaker 1: You're wasting your time there.

870
00:43:59,414 --> 00:44:02,232
Speaker 0: You know, now you might say rim and Scott, you're smart.

871
00:44:02,312 --> 00:44:04,524
Speaker 0: Why don't you just get reservations up this?

872
00:44:05,025 --> 00:44:07,814
Speaker 0: If you can get reservations, get them.

873
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:17,316
Speaker 0: But I will warn you, if you live in an area where there are a lot of popular restaurants and a lot of people, pretty much no good restaurant is going to take reservations.

874
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,744
Speaker 1: Or if they do take reservations, you're not gonna be able to get one unless you call way ahead.

875
00:44:21,765 --> 00:44:25,166
Speaker 1: And if you're, you know, it's hard to decide where to eat that far in advance.

876
00:44:25,186 --> 00:44:26,535
Speaker 1: Cause what kind of mood will you get?

877
00:44:26,616 --> 00:44:37,920
Speaker 0: Seriously, like pretty much every good restaurant in New York and in this area, except for the ultra fancy ones, like they won't, they don't take reservations because they're going to be full no matter what, for all the hours they're open.

878
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:47,693
Speaker 1: reservations are for when you're going to have like a party with a schedule, you know, like, Hey, such and such day as someone's anniversary, let's get a reservation for 25 people at the fancy house.

879
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,965
Speaker 1: You know, that's what a reservation is for.

880
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,619
Speaker 1: Reservations are not for really anything else.

881
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:54,950
Speaker 0: What you can do is try the call ahead.

882
00:44:55,131 --> 00:44:56,498
Speaker 0: The call ahead is a special thing.

883
00:44:56,538 --> 00:45:00,485
Speaker 0: And that is the way I have gotten reservations from places that don't do reservations.

884
00:45:00,505 --> 00:45:03,322
Speaker 1: You say, Hey, you guys full, what's your weight before you go there?

885
00:45:03,443 --> 00:45:08,902
Speaker 0: Or you call him and remember you, you can't just call him and ask because then they're either going to lie or they're going to say, yeah, we don't know.

886
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:12,045
Speaker 1: Just show up or they won't even pick up the phone and don't say the word reservation.

887
00:45:12,105 --> 00:45:15,564
Speaker 0: You call and you just ask like, Hey, listen, I got like 30 people.

888
00:45:16,207 --> 00:45:18,539
Speaker 0: And in an hour or so, we're going to come by your place.

889
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:19,484
Speaker 0: You think you can handle that?

890
00:45:20,207 --> 00:45:31,865
Speaker 0: And now, instead of just, you're not asking them for something anymore, you are offering them 30 people worth of food and big groups tend to tip extravagantly and order more food than they otherwise would.

891
00:45:32,127 --> 00:45:38,885
Speaker 0: If the individuals came by themselves, you can also put them all around one table, one waiter handles it all, all the orders come in at once.

892
00:45:39,247 --> 00:45:40,394
Speaker 0: Restaurants love you.

893
00:45:40,515 --> 00:45:48,130
Speaker 0: If you bring a giant group, unless you're a diner in a college town, in which case they able to shut the door in your face or unless you're jerks.

894
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:49,354
Speaker 0: Yeah.

895
00:45:49,555 --> 00:45:49,795
Speaker 0: Yeah.

896
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:51,742
Speaker 0: But we had a lot to talk about.

897
00:45:52,285 --> 00:45:54,135
Speaker 0: We could do like a week on restaurants.

898
00:45:54,457 --> 00:45:54,577
Speaker 1: Yeah.

899
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:57,634
Speaker 1: But anyway, so you got to deal with the weight intelligently.

900
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:01,152
Speaker 1: Don't you basically want to avoid spending a lot of time waiting?

901
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:05,617
Speaker 1: Cause that sucks ass, you know, be willing to just, you know, have backup places to go.

902
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:11,469
Speaker 0: If the weights are too long at the other places, if you got the long wait, confirm the way like multiple times.

903
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:17,122
Speaker 0: And then everybody go to like the bookstore next door or outside and hang out for an hour and then come back.

904
00:46:17,886 --> 00:46:22,452
Speaker 0: And if that restaurant doesn't have your table for you when you get back or they say, Hey, you weren't here.

905
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:22,955
Speaker 0: We gave it up.

906
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:23,961
Speaker 0: Never eat there again.

907
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:24,402
Speaker 0: Yep.

908
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:24,924
Speaker 0: Ever.

909
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:25,505
Speaker 1: All right.

910
00:46:26,488 --> 00:46:32,512
Speaker 1: Um, so when ordering, just order food order order and don't, don't be afraid.

911
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:36,048
Speaker 1: Like my mom doesn't talk to waiters, you know, don't be my mom.

912
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:37,836
Speaker 1: You have to talk to the waiter.

913
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:40,731
Speaker 1: order, you know, speak up, say something.

914
00:46:40,772 --> 00:46:50,892
Speaker 0: If you didn't hear what the special was, just ask again, because every time the waiter comes, they say the four specials, they leave a few minutes later, someone in our group will be like, Hey, what was in that fish special?

915
00:46:51,113 --> 00:46:51,354
Speaker 0: Yeah.

916
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:52,962
Speaker 0: No one remembers as the waiter.

917
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:53,747
Speaker 0: Don't just order it.

918
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:54,130
Speaker 1: Yeah.

919
00:46:54,170 --> 00:47:03,969
Speaker 1: I mean, go, you know, if you need some water, if you know, I mean, you know, people like sort of are afraid to like harass waiters a little bit because they're afraid of like spitting in the food number one.

920
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:07,628
Speaker 0: If you're getting the waiter's attention, there are ways to do it in ways not to do it.

921
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:08,613
Speaker 1: Yeah.

922
00:47:08,754 --> 00:47:09,820
Speaker 0: Don't come over here.

923
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,868
Speaker 0: Don't do the two finger in the mouth of whistle.

924
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:19,949
Speaker 0: Don't snap your fingers and say Garcon Garcon unless you're in the kind of restaurant where you're paying enough money to where they expect that.

925
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:20,853
Speaker 1: Yeah.

926
00:47:21,316 --> 00:47:34,672
Speaker 1: But you know, if you just, you know, if you just talk to them like normal people, they're not going to think you're an ass just because you, you know, talk to them a bunch, you know, like if you need a napkin, if you need new silverware, you know, just, just freaking ask for it.

927
00:47:34,712 --> 00:47:36,240
Speaker 1: Don't and don't hesitate either.

928
00:47:36,441 --> 00:47:41,519
Speaker 1: You know, because if you hesitate, you're just going to be sitting there like waiting for another four because you dropped yours on the floor.

929
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,485
Speaker 1: You need that for quickly.

930
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:46,645
Speaker 0: Now to who's getting cold if you need the waiter, but most people do.

931
00:47:46,706 --> 00:47:47,732
Speaker 0: And everyone does this.

932
00:47:47,773 --> 00:47:49,564
Speaker 0: Like I watch people at other tables doing it.

933
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:53,165
Speaker 0: And it aggravates me to the point that I almost want to intervene on their behalf.

934
00:47:53,687 --> 00:47:56,440
Speaker 0: If you want a waiter, just we'll look around.

935
00:47:56,701 --> 00:48:02,010
Speaker 0: And as soon as you see anyone who works in the restaurant, just watch their face and make eye contact with them.

936
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:13,735
Speaker 0: Everyone seems to like, kind of look in the direction of a waiter kind of, but then if the waiter turns to them, they like avoid eye contact and kind of just like, look like they're waiting for someone, but they don't actually engage.

937
00:48:13,815 --> 00:48:17,758
Speaker 1: And a lot of people, a lot of people like only want to talk to the waiter for their table.

938
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:19,772
Speaker 1: Just talk to the first one who comes by.

939
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:27,538
Speaker 1: Cause if like you're going to, sometimes depending on the restaurant, it might be a while before the one for your table comes back, you know, they might be hanging out.

940
00:48:27,558 --> 00:48:28,784
Speaker 1: They might be doing other tables.

941
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:32,019
Speaker 0: This does not apply to fancy restaurants.

942
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:40,539
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're at like sparks in New York city, like the steakhouse, there are waiters watching your table for any discomfort and they appear and fix it.

943
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:46,227
Speaker 0: Like I dropped my fork, a waiter, just put another one on the table before I could reach down and get it.

944
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:47,052
Speaker 1: Wow.

945
00:48:47,152 --> 00:48:47,736
Speaker 1: That's good stuff.

946
00:48:47,796 --> 00:48:48,500
Speaker 0: It was amazing.

947
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,701
Speaker 1: I like, yeah, some restaurants like they'll refill the water as soon as it's empty and others, you gotta be like, Hey, can I get some water over here?

948
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:59,991
Speaker 0: Some places will just bring another bottle of the wine you uncork it and just start pouring glasses.

949
00:49:00,635 --> 00:49:01,259
Speaker 1: That's cause they want it.

950
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,682
Speaker 0: They want you to start paying, but at the same time they're basically pouring money, but these are the kind of places where you're going to order it anyway.

951
00:49:07,723 --> 00:49:08,305
Speaker 0: They just know.

952
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:08,687
Speaker 0: Yeah.

953
00:49:08,707 --> 00:49:09,731
Speaker 1: All right.

954
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,263
Speaker 0: Uh, seriously make eye contact.

955
00:49:12,544 --> 00:49:15,841
Speaker 0: And then as soon as they make eye contact with you, don't break it.

956
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:29,862
Speaker 1: Look right at them and nod like, come here or give, you know, some sort of, you know, signal that is visual and perhaps audible to let them know that you want them to don't do the Lewis black, where the fuck is my food?

957
00:49:30,363 --> 00:49:30,785
Speaker 1: Yeah.

958
00:49:31,507 --> 00:49:33,313
Speaker 1: Yeah.

959
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:42,357
Speaker 1: And the thing is, you know, if your food is like, you know, not coming, you know, you know, usually what I've never had some, you know, like sometimes you might get worried.

960
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:44,693
Speaker 1: Like everyone else's food comes and your food doesn't come.

961
00:49:44,713 --> 00:49:47,189
Speaker 1: You might be worried, like, Oh, do they fuck up my order?

962
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:47,954
Speaker 1: What's going on?

963
00:49:48,497 --> 00:49:53,873
Speaker 1: Pretty much any time I've ever had that worry, someone always comes out and is like, yeah, your food will be ready and whatever.

964
00:49:53,894 --> 00:49:54,398
Speaker 1: Just a minute.

965
00:49:54,478 --> 00:49:55,203
Speaker 1: It's like, okay.

966
00:49:55,686 --> 00:50:05,581
Speaker 1: Now it's still, if you're, if you're still worried about it, just ask now when it comes to don't ask you like quickly enough, everyone else is going to be done eating and you're still going to be eating there.

967
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:11,726
Speaker 0: When it comes to bad food, you've really got away the risk reward ratio here.

968
00:50:12,128 --> 00:50:16,770
Speaker 0: If you're in a sleazy diner and your clam chowder comes out cold, just don't eat it.

969
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:18,016
Speaker 0: And don't ask about it.

970
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:20,287
Speaker 0: Just give up that $4 is gone.

971
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:21,774
Speaker 1: Just let it be, just let it be.

972
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:27,590
Speaker 0: But if you're at the fancy steakhouse and your steak isn't cooked right, and you point this out, they'll just bring another steak.

973
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:30,329
Speaker 0: They won't even like, don't worry about them spitting in the food.

974
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,061
Speaker 0: They won't even think to spit in the food.

975
00:50:32,081 --> 00:50:32,665
Speaker 0: They don't care.

976
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:38,053
Speaker 0: But the, basically the less you're paying for your food, the less you can get away with.

977
00:50:38,695 --> 00:50:43,360
Speaker 1: I know it's like, you know, don't like, you know, and it depends on like the kind of complaint, right?

978
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,419
Speaker 1: Like let's say you ordered a cheese, you're at a diner, right?

979
00:50:46,439 --> 00:50:50,705
Speaker 1: And you ordered a hamburger with no cheese and it comes out with a piece of cheese, right?

980
00:50:51,811 --> 00:50:54,143
Speaker 1: Tell them that it came up with a piece of cheese that you don't want.

981
00:50:54,244 --> 00:50:58,293
Speaker 1: You ordered no cheese, you know, and they'll come out with another burger with no cheese on it.

982
00:50:58,313 --> 00:51:01,640
Speaker 0: It might just be the same burger with the cheese scraped off, but that's what you get for a diner.

983
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,687
Speaker 1: But that's fine though.

984
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:03,251
Speaker 1: That's what you want.

985
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:04,078
Speaker 1: But don't turn back.

986
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:07,619
Speaker 1: If you, if they bring out a burger and you say, this is medium rare.

987
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,188
Speaker 1: I wanted it medium at the diner.

988
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:10,937
Speaker 1: You got, that's not good.

989
00:51:10,957 --> 00:51:11,460
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

990
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:11,740
Speaker 0: Yeah.

991
00:51:11,761 --> 00:51:13,972
Speaker 0: Burgers of diners come out diner rare.

992
00:51:14,313 --> 00:51:14,655
Speaker 1: Yeah.

993
00:51:14,957 --> 00:51:21,222
Speaker 1: You know, medium only, only complain if they screwed up the actual order, the biggest one.

994
00:51:21,262 --> 00:51:23,655
Speaker 1: And I don't complain about the food being bad.

995
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:25,727
Speaker 0: It really bothers me when I see people do this.

996
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:33,122
Speaker 0: And if you order wine, you know, they bring the wine out and they like pour a little bit of it for you to check and they give you the cork to look at and they show you the bottle.

997
00:51:33,805 --> 00:51:40,550
Speaker 0: That's all one to prove to you that they're bringing you the actual wine you ordered because otherwise they're like, they don't say anything when they do this.

998
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,708
Speaker 1: You're expected sort of know what's going on, the deal, right?

999
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:48,692
Speaker 1: But they're not like checking to see if you think the wine is good, right?

1000
00:51:48,913 --> 00:51:52,810
Speaker 0: To see one, to prove to you, look, you ordered a 97 blah, blah, blah.

1001
00:51:53,132 --> 00:51:55,182
Speaker 0: I have brought for you a 97 blue, right?

1002
00:51:55,202 --> 00:52:02,197
Speaker 1: Because what could happen is some restaurant could take a bottle that says 97 blah, blah, blah on it and put in Thunderbird.

1003
00:52:02,498 --> 00:52:02,779
Speaker 1: Right.

1004
00:52:02,939 --> 00:52:12,556
Speaker 0: And they want to prove to you that it's not Thunderbird, but when they do this, I've seen people get the other bird is not $30 a glass and they sniff it and they sniff the cork, which is silly.

1005
00:52:12,576 --> 00:52:13,948
Speaker 0: If you sniff the cork, you don't know what you're doing.

1006
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:14,352
Speaker 1: That's all right.

1007
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:15,362
Speaker 0: Look at the car.

1008
00:52:15,422 --> 00:52:16,308
Speaker 0: Don't sniff the car.

1009
00:52:16,328 --> 00:52:18,563
Speaker 1: You're looking at the car to make sure it's not crumbled.

1010
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:19,468
Speaker 1: It should be in one piece.

1011
00:52:19,528 --> 00:52:22,543
Speaker 1: And that means that the wine is not bad.

1012
00:52:22,663 --> 00:52:24,190
Speaker 1: Also turned into vinegar.

1013
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:31,269
Speaker 0: If the wine waiter uses one of those twisty corkscrews, if you twist it in, then you pull the little levers as opposed to a wine key.

1014
00:52:31,972 --> 00:52:33,619
Speaker 0: Don't ask them about the wine.

1015
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:34,243
Speaker 0: They don't know.

1016
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:34,988
Speaker 1: That's right.

1017
00:52:35,189 --> 00:52:36,839
Speaker 0: They'll use like this livery wine key.

1018
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:42,235
Speaker 0: That means they know because at least someone, of course, you might see them twist the wine key in and then start yanking on it.

1019
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:42,839
Speaker 0: They don't know.

1020
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,670
Speaker 0: that happened at a restaurant near us.

1021
00:52:45,851 --> 00:52:51,455
Speaker 1: The skill of their bottle opening is directly in proportion to their knowledge.

1022
00:52:51,555 --> 00:52:54,792
Speaker 0: The best bottle opening I ever got wasn't in the fancy place in New York.

1023
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:57,827
Speaker 0: It was from this awesome waiter in Costa Rica.

1024
00:52:58,048 --> 00:52:58,450
Speaker 1: Really?

1025
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:00,138
Speaker 1: This guy, how do you open it?

1026
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:13,001
Speaker 0: Well, he just had like perfect, like if you were, if wine bottle opening or in the Olympics, like all those other synchronized kind of specific movement arts, this guy got a 9.8 out of 10 and maybe a seven from the Italian judge.

1027
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:15,287
Speaker 0: Like it was perfect.

1028
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:20,160
Speaker 0: I don't know if anyone will even get that.

1029
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,346
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

1030
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:22,674
Speaker 0: I don't know if anyone remembers.

1031
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:23,560
Speaker 1: That's all right.

1032
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:31,774
Speaker 0: Anyway, but when they pour you that little bit of wine, that is for you to taste it and tell them if the wine spoiled or not.

1033
00:53:32,015 --> 00:53:35,208
Speaker 0: So if you don't like the wine, that's tough shit.

1034
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:43,245
Speaker 1: Like if you ordered, you know, a man of Shevitz and you don't like how it tastes, you think it's nasty, but it's not bad.

1035
00:53:43,285 --> 00:53:45,035
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, turned into vinegar.

1036
00:53:45,116 --> 00:53:48,133
Speaker 1: It's, it is what it is and it is what it says on the bottle.

1037
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,130
Speaker 1: But you ordered something that it turns out you don't actually like.

1038
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:52,618
Speaker 1: That's tough shit.

1039
00:53:52,658 --> 00:53:56,202
Speaker 1: That's, you know, like you order a cheeseburger and then you find out you don't like cheese.

1040
00:53:56,263 --> 00:53:57,691
Speaker 1: Well, that's your problem.

1041
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:09,433
Speaker 0: But now the difficulty with wine, of course, is that if you haven't had a lot of wine, you have no idea if you're fooling you or not, because there are some wines out there, some expensive ones that taste like ass.

1042
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:09,975
Speaker 1: Yep.

1043
00:54:10,075 --> 00:54:12,307
Speaker 0: But they, they, they're supposed to taste like ass.

1044
00:54:12,508 --> 00:54:13,434
Speaker 0: That's what they taste like.

1045
00:54:13,494 --> 00:54:14,199
Speaker 0: It didn't go bad.

1046
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:15,427
Speaker 0: That's just what it tastes like.

1047
00:54:15,468 --> 00:54:15,951
Speaker 1: That's right.

1048
00:54:15,971 --> 00:54:17,421
Speaker 1: That's why I don't drink that shit.

1049
00:54:17,803 --> 00:54:19,211
Speaker 0: But there's also wine that's really good.

1050
00:54:19,271 --> 00:54:19,694
Speaker 1: That's cheap.

1051
00:54:20,317 --> 00:54:20,740
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1052
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:24,932
Speaker 0: Simply, if you don't know, don't order either.

1053
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:33,036
Speaker 0: If you're order the cheapest wine, just whatever the cheapest wine and the color that you want is order that do not order the second cheapest wine.

1054
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:37,440
Speaker 0: The second cheapest wine on almost every menu is crappier than the cheapest wine.

1055
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:41,502
Speaker 0: And it is there solely for the people who are with a date or with other people.

1056
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:46,872
Speaker 0: And they want to be impressive and order wine, but they don't know about wine and they're cheap.

1057
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:49,589
Speaker 0: They don't want to order the cheapest wine because that's obvious.

1058
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,280
Speaker 0: So they order the second cheapest wine.

1059
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:51,822
Speaker 1: Right.

1060
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,708
Speaker 1: One thing you can definitely do though, is some restaurants have like these safeties, right?

1061
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:58,807
Speaker 1: For example, the, the number one of these is the macaroni grill, right?

1062
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,906
Speaker 1: Which is a chain, but it is an excellent Italian restaurant.

1063
00:55:01,987 --> 00:55:04,282
Speaker 1: You know, I guess it's not super excellent, but it's pretty good.

1064
00:55:04,824 --> 00:55:07,455
Speaker 1: They have wine on this honor system.

1065
00:55:07,475 --> 00:55:11,592
Speaker 1: So you go in and if you don't know a wine to get, just get the wine.

1066
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:14,083
Speaker 1: They have like the macaroni girl wine.

1067
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:15,472
Speaker 1: It comes in a gigantic jug.

1068
00:55:15,572 --> 00:55:17,202
Speaker 0: Actually pretty much every restaurant has this.

1069
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:18,390
Speaker 0: It's called the house wine.

1070
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:21,450
Speaker 0: So if you really don't know what to order at all, just order.

1071
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,850
Speaker 0: I didn't think other restaurants said that order a glass of the house wine.

1072
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:31,047
Speaker 0: Now they might ask which one, in which case, just admit to the waiter that you don't know anything about wine and ask them what they recommend.

1073
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:34,593
Speaker 0: And if they don't know, they will go back and ask the chef, the chef will say, give them whatever.

1074
00:55:34,734 --> 00:55:37,550
Speaker 1: And at the very least, just try to figure out red or white.

1075
00:55:37,992 --> 00:55:41,913
Speaker 1: Even I know that if you get that right, you're like 90% of the way there.

1076
00:55:42,174 --> 00:55:44,184
Speaker 0: If you really don't know, drink the wine.

1077
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:47,020
Speaker 0: that is the color of the meat or food you were eating.

1078
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:51,660
Speaker 0: That's pretty much at least the closest color, but enough about wine.

1079
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:54,875
Speaker 0: Yes, we actually have gone on a while.

1080
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:55,819
Speaker 1: We got to talk about paying.

1081
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:56,161
Speaker 1: That's it.

1082
00:55:56,542 --> 00:55:58,472
Speaker 0: We got, there's a bunch of, uh, quick one.

1083
00:55:59,296 --> 00:56:00,642
Speaker 0: We talked about cutting and running.

1084
00:56:00,663 --> 00:56:13,870
Speaker 0: If you sit down at a restaurant and like you're not getting served, even if you have ordered some food, like you've ordered food and it just hasn't come and it's taking way too long, like way too long, uh, warn them that you've got to go.

1085
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:20,765
Speaker 0: And if they can't rectify the situation immediately, you're perfectly within your rights to just say, look, we're leaving and not pay.

1086
00:56:20,846 --> 00:56:21,127
Speaker 1: Yes.

1087
00:56:21,147 --> 00:56:24,460
Speaker 1: You don't have to pay until you have eaten food.

1088
00:56:24,901 --> 00:56:30,429
Speaker 1: If they put food on the table in front of you and it is like, smells like rotten, like, Oh my God, disgusting.

1089
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:31,675
Speaker 1: Just get up and leave.

1090
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:33,887
Speaker 1: As soon as you touch the food, you have to pay.

1091
00:56:33,907 --> 00:56:34,249
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1092
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:41,281
Speaker 0: If you, if you try to say that the burger was bad and you want a refund and you ate all of it, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1093
00:56:41,763 --> 00:56:55,672
Speaker 1: You have to pretty much, if you are going to not pay as soon as the point where you touch the food, you can't, you have to pay, but up until then, don't feel bad about just getting up and leaving until you, you know, cause you should, if you have a reason

1094
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:55,833
Speaker 0: to.

1095
00:56:55,953 --> 00:56:56,214
Speaker 0: Yep.

1096
00:56:56,315 --> 00:56:57,119
Speaker 0: Cut and run.

1097
00:56:57,701 --> 00:56:57,821
Speaker 1: Yep.

1098
00:56:58,864 --> 00:57:02,756
Speaker 0: All right, paying, paying kids one, uh, tax supplies.

1099
00:57:03,157 --> 00:57:07,963
Speaker 0: I, it, it amazes me how many people in my life don't seem to understand that there is tax at restaurants.

1100
00:57:08,204 --> 00:57:08,848
Speaker 1: pay the tax.

1101
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:09,210
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1102
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:15,398
Speaker 1: I mean like if you order something on the, on the menu, it says $15 is probably going to be like a good three, $4 tax.

1103
00:57:16,081 --> 00:57:16,564
Speaker 1: It's really $20.

1104
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:19,582
Speaker 1: You're probably going to have to put down on the table, right?

1105
00:57:19,622 --> 00:57:20,967
Speaker 1: Not 15.

1106
00:57:20,967 --> 00:57:24,019
Speaker 1: So, uh, remember tax exists, especially like New York.

1107
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,083
Speaker 1: The tax is 8%.

1108
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,689
Speaker 1: That's a lot of money.

1109
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:27,251
Speaker 0: Yep.

1110
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:30,842
Speaker 0: Plus, you know, tip 15 to 25%.

1111
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:31,365
Speaker 1: Add that in.

1112
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:31,687
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1113
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:33,740
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, tipping is a whole separate issue.

1114
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,397
Speaker 0: We're not going to talk about the merits of taking tipping.

1115
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:37,989
Speaker 1: We're only going to talk about the reality.

1116
00:57:38,191 --> 00:57:38,332
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1117
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:43,747
Speaker 1: We're not going to talk about, you know, when to, when not to, because there are some very few cases where you shouldn't tip at all.

1118
00:57:43,888 --> 00:57:44,352
Speaker 0: Wait, you know what?

1119
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:46,165
Speaker 1: There are some cases where you should tip a whole bunch.

1120
00:57:46,266 --> 00:57:55,534
Speaker 0: I will give you the, if you are playing life per game theory and you are perfectly rational and practical and acting only in your own self-interest, here's what you do.

1121
00:57:56,037 --> 00:58:02,027
Speaker 0: If you are never going to go to a restaurant again, or it is a restaurant that will not recognize you don't tip.

1122
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:10,352
Speaker 0: If you're going to return to a restaurant enough to where they will recognize you tip very, very lavishly.

1123
00:58:10,372 --> 00:58:17,720
Speaker 0: And if you tip mediocrely forever, they will always bend over backward for you.

1124
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,606
Speaker 0: For as long as you go there, they'll bring free drinks, free food, free sushi, free, whatever.

1125
00:58:21,908 --> 00:58:22,130
Speaker 0: Yep.

1126
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,760
Speaker 0: The neko did that to us for a while.

1127
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,290
Speaker 0: They give us like just free rolls.

1128
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:29,351
Speaker 1: It's good to have a restaurant that remembers you because then you will get things.

1129
00:58:30,315 --> 00:58:31,158
Speaker 0: Ah, Jay's diner.

1130
00:58:31,259 --> 00:58:31,459
Speaker 1: Yep.

1131
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,797
Speaker 1: I mean, and you don't even have to tip extravagantly to get things.

1132
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:38,193
Speaker 1: Just tip like, you know, 17% and you'll get things.

1133
00:58:38,213 --> 00:58:39,981
Speaker 1: Y'all like an extra dollar or two.

1134
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:46,410
Speaker 0: Well, of course we really love beyond at Applebee's when, uh, here's how to get into this whole, this final discussion.

1135
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:49,425
Speaker 0: We were at Applebee's all the time with our wag.

1136
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:53,326
Speaker 0: So there'd be like between 10 and 30 people who were disgusting gamers.

1137
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:54,935
Speaker 0: We're all friends with them though.

1138
00:58:55,398 --> 00:59:00,485
Speaker 0: Nominally, we're all in a group and we'd all sit at like a gigantic table and then all the tables around it.

1139
00:59:00,968 --> 00:59:04,085
Speaker 0: And in the end we'd get one gigantic check and everyone would throw in their money.

1140
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:08,869
Speaker 0: And I hope we all got accustomed to throwing in this certain amount and it always worked out.

1141
00:59:09,994 --> 00:59:14,278
Speaker 0: And one day we went to Applebee's and like no one else went for some reason.

1142
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,928
Speaker 0: So it was just like three of us, three or four of us sitting at a little table, hanging out, doing the same thing.

1143
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:20,034
Speaker 0: we always do in a small group.

1144
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:23,558
Speaker 0: We all threw in what we normally throw in for the same amount of food.

1145
00:59:23,598 --> 00:59:24,622
Speaker 0: We all order the same stuff.

1146
00:59:25,744 --> 00:59:37,094
Speaker 0: We left a 115% tip and we realized this and we started calculating what we actually owed for our food.

1147
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,668
Speaker 0: And we discovered that someone was an asshole.

1148
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:42,896
Speaker 0: We didn't know who.

1149
00:59:43,177 --> 00:59:45,023
Speaker 0: We only knew that it wasn't anyone with us.

1150
00:59:46,568 --> 00:59:53,800
Speaker 0: And I've realized the crux of this is not so much that people are willfully trying to skip out on paying what they owe.

1151
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,014
Speaker 0: There are people like that, but this was not the case.

1152
00:59:56,417 --> 00:59:58,569
Speaker 0: I don't think I've ever run into anyone where that was the case.

1153
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:05,646
Speaker 0: I think people legitimately don't actually calculate how much they owe and they think they're putting in enough, but they really aren't.

1154
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:16,869
Speaker 1: People don't seem to realize, A, how much the tax actually is, B, how much the tip actually is, C, drinks and advertisers, what they actually cost.

1155
01:00:16,889 --> 01:00:20,528
Speaker 1: Someone will get like, you know, I always get water, right?

1156
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:21,071
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

1157
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:23,728
Speaker 1: Or I'll get a milkshake and occasionally lemonade.

1158
01:00:23,748 --> 01:00:26,244
Speaker 1: And that's about all I'll ever get to drink at a restaurant.

1159
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:37,606
Speaker 0: Most of the time, just tap water or like wine or a cocktail, something big that I pay for, like on my own, because it's like if you get like a glass of wine, it's probably going to be like five dollars at least, if not more.

1160
01:00:38,088 --> 01:00:41,403
Speaker 0: But more importantly, sodas, soft drinks, stuff like that.

1161
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:42,791
Speaker 1: They charge like 250.

1162
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:42,891
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1163
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:45,868
Speaker 0: And a lot of restaurants we go to, they charge three, four.

1164
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,421
Speaker 0: I've seen places charge five bucks for a soda.

1165
01:00:48,783 --> 01:00:50,550
Speaker 0: Oftentimes they're not free refills.

1166
01:00:50,851 --> 01:00:51,132
Speaker 1: Yep.

1167
01:00:51,534 --> 01:00:55,837
Speaker 1: So people sort of, you know, forget like how much those things actually cost.

1168
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:58,791
Speaker 1: I mean, if I go to a diner, I'll get French toast for five bucks.

1169
01:00:59,334 --> 01:01:02,288
Speaker 1: Then I'll get water, orange juice and milk.

1170
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:04,002
Speaker 1: And the orange juice and milk are two dollars each.

1171
01:01:04,344 --> 01:01:05,349
Speaker 1: So it's nine dollars.

1172
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:13,530
Speaker 1: And people, you know, like they sort of they look at like the entree that they order on the menu and because that's the biggest, most solid price.

1173
01:01:14,012 --> 01:01:23,257
Speaker 1: And then all the other things there, you know, a portion of an appetizer, you know, or, you know, that they shared with some people and like a drink and a refill on it.

1174
01:01:23,499 --> 01:01:28,852
Speaker 1: You know those are small and they don't actually see those, you know, they don't look at the price of the drink on the menu.

1175
01:01:29,214 --> 01:01:30,984
Speaker 1: So it doesn't come into their calculation.

1176
01:01:31,325 --> 01:01:33,576
Speaker 1: So they pay, you know, maybe their entree was 15.

1177
01:01:33,576 --> 01:01:36,147
Speaker 1: So they throw in 18.

1178
01:01:36,147 --> 01:01:41,130
Speaker 1: They owe like 25 and they don't realize it because they weren't, you know, actually calculating.

1179
01:01:41,371 --> 01:01:41,633
Speaker 0: Yep.

1180
01:01:41,693 --> 01:01:47,042
Speaker 0: So one, if you're a smart person, the way to avoid this whole situation, always drink tap water.

1181
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:52,413
Speaker 0: Well, one, if you want to save money, never order a drink, just always get water because that that's free.

1182
01:01:52,514 --> 01:01:56,417
Speaker 1: and watch out for those restaurants that try to sell you a bottled water, say tap water.

1183
01:01:56,699 --> 01:01:56,840
Speaker 0: Yep.

1184
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,337
Speaker 0: But they have to give it to you and don't order appetizers.

1185
01:02:01,437 --> 01:02:09,477
Speaker 0: Or if you do whatever you actually order, note exactly what it cost from the menu and remember that and calculate exactly what you owe.

1186
01:02:09,537 --> 01:02:18,102
Speaker 0: Just take, you know, add everything up that you owe and then add like 30 percent to it to cover tax tip and everything and put that in and have these numbers handy.

1187
01:02:18,423 --> 01:02:25,659
Speaker 0: And then when the bill comes up short, literally, the only way to deal with this is to point out, look, I got this and this and this.

1188
01:02:25,981 --> 01:02:26,827
Speaker 0: I owed exactly this.

1189
01:02:26,867 --> 01:02:27,753
Speaker 0: Here's the tip I put in.

1190
01:02:27,773 --> 01:02:28,377
Speaker 0: I'm out.

1191
01:02:28,418 --> 01:02:29,142
Speaker 0: And then leave the table.

1192
01:02:29,724 --> 01:02:29,925
Speaker 1: Yep.

1193
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:33,820
Speaker 0: Because there is no way to resolve this situation.

1194
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:36,719
Speaker 0: And I hate to say this, but the front row crew, this happens too.

1195
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:45,531
Speaker 0: We're getting actually very close to figuring out who's causing the problem by eating with different combinations of people for a while and all the burning wheel games and everything.

1196
01:02:46,135 --> 01:02:46,860
Speaker 0: We're real close.

1197
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,066
Speaker 0: We've got to narrow down.

1198
01:02:48,106 --> 01:02:49,372
Speaker 0: I think there are.

1199
01:02:49,654 --> 01:02:57,090
Speaker 0: there are four suspects and it's either some or all of them who are consistently shorting the bill every time the front row crew goes out.

1200
01:02:58,277 --> 01:02:59,343
Speaker 1: It's definitely not malicious.

1201
01:02:59,565 --> 01:03:01,740
Speaker 1: You know, I don't think anyone's trying to short the bill.

1202
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,887
Speaker 1: Everyone's throwing in money.

1203
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:08,804
Speaker 1: But I think there are just some people who, you know, neglect to understand, you know, the cost of what they're actually ordering.

1204
01:03:08,945 --> 01:03:13,531
Speaker 0: Seriously, to avoid these situations for you yourself and to save money or to tap water.

1205
01:03:13,551 --> 01:03:22,200
Speaker 1: And I mean, the worst is when I went to that Thai place and I think I paid for like three or four people's meals, you know, after I calculated how much money I actually got back.

1206
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:24,736
Speaker 0: Everyone actually owed with all the food we ordered.

1207
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:26,873
Speaker 1: I mean, that was you know, it was like this takeout place.

1208
01:03:26,913 --> 01:03:30,234
Speaker 1: No one thought it was big money, but the bill was like over 200 dollars.

1209
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:34,395
Speaker 0: Well, because everyone's meal plus appetizers and drinks was like 40 bucks.

1210
01:03:34,516 --> 01:03:36,885
Speaker 1: And everyone got like Thai's teas all around.

1211
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:38,029
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1212
01:03:38,992 --> 01:03:39,192
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1213
01:03:39,754 --> 01:03:41,882
Speaker 0: But seriously, tap water is the way to go.

1214
01:03:42,104 --> 01:03:51,934
Speaker 0: You would not believe how much money I saved when I was poor at RIT, not getting appetizers and more importantly, not sharing appetizers with other people because they will screw you.

1215
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:52,035
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1216
01:03:52,055 --> 01:03:54,527
Speaker 1: I mean, how many times do you get an appetizer?

1217
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:54,748
Speaker 1: Right.

1218
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:59,193
Speaker 1: And it's like a Shumai and you get one of the Shumai and the rest go away.

1219
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:02,232
Speaker 0: You're like, but then no one else puts in money for the appetizer.

1220
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:02,675
Speaker 0: Right.

1221
01:04:02,695 --> 01:04:06,780
Speaker 1: So it's like you ate one of the Shumai, even though you ordered it and you paid for all.

1222
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:12,233
Speaker 0: the drawback of this is that you mostly when you go with a big group of people, they're going to want to split the check evenly.

1223
01:04:12,254 --> 01:04:13,622
Speaker 0: And that only works.

1224
01:04:13,643 --> 01:04:19,683
Speaker 0: I mean, really, if you're eating at a place like, I don't know, the hibachi at the Necco, we go to where everything pretty much costs the same.

1225
01:04:19,824 --> 01:04:19,964
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1226
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:20,870
Speaker 0: Everyone throws in 20 bucks.

1227
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:21,192
Speaker 0: You're good.

1228
01:04:21,997 --> 01:04:23,687
Speaker 0: Don't let everyone just split the checkup.

1229
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:24,511
Speaker 1: It works.

1230
01:04:24,572 --> 01:04:31,589
Speaker 1: it like a family style place, too, because everyone is all sharing every everyone's eating everything, you know, but don't pull.

1231
01:04:31,629 --> 01:04:32,815
Speaker 0: Don't let people do that.

1232
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,925
Speaker 0: If you're going to order the tap water.

1233
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:35,589
Speaker 1: Right.

1234
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,700
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, think about this, right?

1235
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,168
Speaker 1: If we go to a steakhouse, right.

1236
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:40,897
Speaker 1: I order a 20 dollar steak.

1237
01:04:41,098 --> 01:04:42,304
Speaker 1: Rim orders a 20 dollar steak.

1238
01:04:42,344 --> 01:04:42,666
Speaker 1: All right.

1239
01:04:43,168 --> 01:04:44,092
Speaker 1: I get a tap water.

1240
01:04:44,454 --> 01:04:46,503
Speaker 1: Rim gets a 30 dollar bottle of wine.

1241
01:04:46,543 --> 01:04:48,189
Speaker 1: Well, splitting that evenly.

1242
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,237
Speaker 1: Not bad, really.

1243
01:04:50,698 --> 01:04:56,063
Speaker 1: Even if I got a 10 dollar appetizer and we shake, he ate one third and I ate two thirds of it.

1244
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:59,440
Speaker 1: Really unfair to split the bill evenly.

1245
01:05:01,702 --> 01:05:04,417
Speaker 0: Now, I don't know what to do about the shorting people.

1246
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:11,583
Speaker 0: in the long run, though, and if you confront him or what, because it's not going to be that long until we'd like kind of mathematically prove who is shorting our bill.

1247
01:05:11,864 --> 01:05:12,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all right.

1248
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:16,780
Speaker 0: I don't think any of them are going to listen to the show anytime soon and everyone's coming out this weekend.

1249
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:21,399
Speaker 0: So if they don't listen, then maybe I can engineer the final test.

1250
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,188
Speaker 0: I need to figure out exactly who it is.

1251
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:28,174
Speaker 1: Maybe we should do is just go around the table and get the money from the people one at a time.

1252
01:05:28,194 --> 01:05:32,114
Speaker 1: And then, you know, just be like, OK, Scott, give me your money.

1253
01:05:32,335 --> 01:05:33,944
Speaker 1: OK, other Scott, give me your money.

1254
01:05:33,964 --> 01:05:36,177
Speaker 1: OK, you know, Emily, give me your money.

1255
01:05:36,217 --> 01:05:40,325
Speaker 1: And then you'd be like, you know, and then if someone gives you their money, that's not enough.

1256
01:05:41,551 --> 01:05:44,309
Speaker 0: And that'll be that you got to know what everyone orders and how much it costs.

1257
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:48,558
Speaker 1: Well, if you're you're going to do the credit card thing and you just get, you know, you get the bill.

1258
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,352
Speaker 0: No, then you can't do it based on the bill.

1259
01:05:50,372 --> 01:05:59,764
Speaker 0: That's why I said you have to note it before you give the menu away, because when you get the bill, it's going to say like chicken parm for and then the price will be that times four.

1260
01:06:00,106 --> 01:06:00,408
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1261
01:06:00,469 --> 01:06:01,999
Speaker 0: And you're going to have to do a little bit more math.

1262
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:02,583
Speaker 1: That's right.

1263
01:06:02,604 --> 01:06:03,512
Speaker 1: You get a little calculator.

1264
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:04,903
Speaker 0: Plus, people don't remember what they order.

1265
01:06:06,231 --> 01:06:10,372
Speaker 0: You know, often someone will come up to the table and be like, here's the shrimp, whatever.

1266
01:06:10,553 --> 01:06:13,146
Speaker 0: And no one claims it because no one remembers what they ordered.

1267
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,960
Speaker 1: I remember what I ordered anyway.

1268
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:17,083
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

1269
01:06:17,103 --> 01:06:27,543
Speaker 1: The other thing is, you know, if you're finished eating and you want to leave because this happens to us a lot and they didn't bring you the check yet, like get someone's attention ASAP to get that check.

1270
01:06:27,604 --> 01:06:28,290
Speaker 1: Otherwise you're going to be.

1271
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:29,461
Speaker 1: you could be sitting there for a while.

1272
01:06:29,521 --> 01:06:30,808
Speaker 0: No one better way.

1273
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:33,625
Speaker 0: As soon as you get your food, ask for the check immediately.

1274
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:39,443
Speaker 1: Well, if you know that you're going to be in a rush to get out of there, even like let's say you have a train to catch or a meeting.

1275
01:06:39,764 --> 01:06:40,026
Speaker 1: Right.

1276
01:06:40,307 --> 01:06:43,284
Speaker 1: Ask for the check as soon as you sit down or right after you order.

1277
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:46,811
Speaker 1: That way, as soon as you finish eating, you can get up and leave because you have the check already.

1278
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:47,356
Speaker 0: It's weird.

1279
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:49,171
Speaker 0: Like lately and it seems like it's getting worse.

1280
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:49,796
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

1281
01:06:49,856 --> 01:06:51,489
Speaker 0: Maybe because people aren't eating out as much.

1282
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:53,484
Speaker 0: The restaurants want people to be in there longer.

1283
01:06:53,504 --> 01:06:54,491
Speaker 0: So it looks like it's full.

1284
01:06:54,813 --> 01:06:56,242
Speaker 0: Maybe the Lord of dessert, all that stuff.

1285
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,956
Speaker 0: But restaurants just don't bring me the check.

1286
01:06:59,297 --> 01:07:02,020
Speaker 0: I've sat in places for like a half hour just trying to get anyone's attention.

1287
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,459
Speaker 1: I think it's also because we eat quickly than more quickly than average.

1288
01:07:05,161 --> 01:07:06,732
Speaker 1: Maybe especially when there's fewer of us.

1289
01:07:06,953 --> 01:07:07,175
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1290
01:07:07,215 --> 01:07:10,678
Speaker 1: But when the crew when there's more people, the check seems to come at the right time.

1291
01:07:10,718 --> 01:07:12,775
Speaker 0: The crew together will be in a restaurant for like two hours.

1292
01:07:12,815 --> 01:07:13,037
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1293
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,321
Speaker 1: But when there's fewer people, we always end up waiting for the check as we eat quickly.

1294
01:07:16,602 --> 01:07:17,626
Speaker 1: Right.

1295
01:07:18,028 --> 01:07:22,886
Speaker 1: And then, you know, pay and then, you know, play the not it game to see who has to go up and pay.

1296
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:23,468
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1297
01:07:24,653 --> 01:07:29,539
Speaker 0: If you want to get a trick I've always found where Peter and out here, I got almost nothing left.

1298
01:07:29,761 --> 01:07:29,982
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1299
01:07:30,143 --> 01:07:37,707
Speaker 0: Offer to pay with your credit card if you know that no one in your group will short and you will always end up with a surplus, even if you pay more than you need to pay.

1300
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:38,391
Speaker 1: That's right.

1301
01:07:38,994 --> 01:07:41,748
Speaker 0: However, if people are shorting, not so much.

1302
01:07:41,969 --> 01:07:50,523
Speaker 1: No, but yeah, if you, if you got a whole bunch of people who are paying the right amount or over, you know, pay with your credit card and you'll get a profit when you collect the cash from everyone else.

1303
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:52,377
Speaker 0: I think we're really Peter and out here.

1304
01:07:52,457 --> 01:07:52,598
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1305
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:53,142
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

1306
01:07:53,384 --> 01:07:54,089
Speaker 0: I had almost nothing.

1307
01:07:54,129 --> 01:07:55,680
Speaker 1: That's how to eat at a restaurant.

1308
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:56,961
Speaker 1: The geek nights away.

1309
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:06,650
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.

1310
01:08:06,831 --> 01:08:09,289
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

Speaker 0: We say feeds plural because geek nights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1313
01:08:27,982 --> 01:08:29,550
Speaker 0: Mondays are science and technology.

1314
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:32,304
Speaker 0: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.
