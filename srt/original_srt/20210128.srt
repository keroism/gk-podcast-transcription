1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,488
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, January 28th, 2021.

2
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:12,948
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:14,371
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:15,873
Speaker 0: And this is geek nights.

5
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:16,314
Speaker 0: Tonight.

6
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:19,680
Speaker 0: We talk about our unfinished business.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,182
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:23,244
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

9
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:24,125
Speaker 0: We have any opening bits?

10
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:26,209
Speaker 0: I got nobody.

11
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:27,752
Speaker 0: that is kind of vaguely relevant.

12
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:32,360
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'll admit that and Scott's doing this, too.

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,482
Speaker 0: So it's not just like me.

14
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:37,247
Speaker 0: We are watching the sports that are happening during covid.

15
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:43,998
Speaker 0: And I have a little bit of an ethical conundrum there, because on one hand, they should not be doing sports yet.

16
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:44,979
Speaker 0: Like it's too soon.

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:53,330
Speaker 1: If I was in charge, if I was in charge, I would have been like, you know, I guess the Super Val is in two weeks or a week and a couple of days.

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,772
Speaker 1: You know, I would have.

19
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:56,314
Speaker 1: I would have been like, no sport.

20
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:58,037
Speaker 1: You cannot have these sports at all.

21
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,360
Speaker 1: The Super Bowl is going to have people at it in Florida.

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,141
Speaker 1: Yeah.

23
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:05,325
Speaker 0: I didn't realize until like a week ago that there's going to be people in that arena.

24
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:06,548
Speaker 0: It's not going to be just closed.

25
00:01:06,648 --> 00:01:07,349
Speaker 0: What arena?

26
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:08,110
Speaker 1: It's a stadium.

27
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:08,531
Speaker 1: Yeah.

28
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:13,097
Speaker 1: But there was no, there was a. there was games last week, like in Kansas City.

29
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:15,680
Speaker 1: They had people, you know, way too many people.

30
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,842
Speaker 0: So even worse.

31
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:19,544
Speaker 0: Well, I guess that's one thing.

32
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:27,052
Speaker 0: But if I don't watch, nothing changes like me choosing to watch or not watch.

33
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:29,195
Speaker 0: There's no I don't have a trolley lever.

34
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:29,755
Speaker 0: I'm pulling.

35
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:33,920
Speaker 0: It's like, do you watch the trolley hit the people or not?

36
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:42,267
Speaker 1: I mean, it's the same old comic where it's like, ah, you criticize society, but you also partake in it.

37
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:42,547
Speaker 1: Right.

38
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:57,360
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, now that I have that comic to so sort of succinctly sum up, you know, participating in evil capitalism and whatnot, it's like, you know, yeah, I'm not like spending money to watch hockey.

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,301
Speaker 1: I'm right.

40
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:00,103
Speaker 1: It's like I'm not pirating a stream.

41
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:03,927
Speaker 1: I'm not buying any hockey stuff.

42
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:04,588
Speaker 1: Right.

43
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:07,270
Speaker 1: I mean, they're just holding our ticket money.

44
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,292
Speaker 1: We're not spending any more ticket.

45
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:13,417
Speaker 0: And like, I wouldn't go even if we could go in any capacity.

46
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:15,779
Speaker 1: If they suddenly said, hey, you know, you can go now.

47
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:16,180
Speaker 1: I'd be like, no.

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,221
Speaker 1: So I do that.

49
00:02:20,303 --> 00:02:33,236
Speaker 0: But the best part is, at least like where I landed is I'm going to keep watching these sports, but I'm going to pirate them and I'm not going to like social media, like celebrate the fact that these sports are happening.

50
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:36,580
Speaker 0: But I am going to watch that Rangers game after Record Geek Nights.

51
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,101
Speaker 1: We'll see.

52
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:40,003
Speaker 1: Just lose again.

53
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:40,744
Speaker 1: It's fine.

54
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:41,145
Speaker 1: Yeah.

55
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:46,313
Speaker 0: You know, the Rangers, they're back to their pattern of, oh, they should have won that game, but they lost.

56
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:47,575
Speaker 0: It's like, no, you just lost it.

57
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:50,680
Speaker 0: Like you were playing good enough to win does not mean you won.

58
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:54,559
Speaker 1: Also, you know, the best players on our team are not showing up.

59
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,440
Speaker 0: Chasturkin's doing the best he can with the D that is presented to him, at least.

60
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,604
Speaker 1: The D is actually, you know, used to be.

61
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:03,007
Speaker 1: our weakness is now strengthened.

62
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:05,071
Speaker 1: It's just the offense that we had.

63
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:09,060
Speaker 1: We have those players still, but those players are not performing at their high level.

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,028
Speaker 1: And everyone's like, you know, blaming the coach.

65
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:12,629
Speaker 1: And it's like, what?

66
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:13,411
Speaker 1: You change the coach?

67
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:14,674
Speaker 1: You think they're just going to win tomorrow?

68
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:16,279
Speaker 1: It's like this, you know, it's like, come on.

69
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:23,113
Speaker 1: And two, everyone's blaming things like, oh, there was no training camp.

70
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,055
Speaker 1: There was no this, no that.

71
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:26,040
Speaker 1: It's like the other teams didn't have training camp either.

72
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,341
Speaker 0: Yep.

73
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,386
Speaker 0: Like, what do you like?

74
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:31,400
Speaker 0: Crieder is slower regardless of any other factor.

75
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:39,077
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the players we have that were good players that we paid a lot the most money to are not playing as well as they played last year.

76
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,360
Speaker 1: It's on them.

77
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:40,961
Speaker 0: Yep.

78
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,226
Speaker 0: So there is a ton of news.

79
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:46,254
Speaker 0: We're not going to talk more about that GameStop thing because it's doing way too fast.

80
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:48,860
Speaker 1: The GameStop thing is the biggest news.

81
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,524
Speaker 1: That's like the freshest news.

82
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:58,636
Speaker 0: It's like actually a new thing that hasn't happened and is not like the political axis of like the actual crisis in America.

83
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,600
Speaker 0: Like it was something orthogonal to that.

84
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,962
Speaker 0: That just happens.

85
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:04,365
Speaker 1: It intersects with so many things.

86
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:14,720
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, basically you can summarize like our times with that story so that we could talk about it probably for like a whole week, just nonstop to cover all the aspects.

87
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,760
Speaker 0: I mean, we've been talking about it nonstop in our like Discord DMs forever.

88
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,224
Speaker 1: The whole Internet is.

89
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:27,377
Speaker 1: But I think what we'll do is for Geek Nights, since we already talked about it way too much, we'll wait until it's done, done.

90
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:28,760
Speaker 1: And then we'll talk about it one more time.

91
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,642
Speaker 0: You know what that is?

92
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:31,366
Speaker 0: We're bringing back the Jack Thompson rule.

93
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:37,700
Speaker 0: We can't talk about Jack Thompson again unless he does something crazier than the last thing he did.

94
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,006
Speaker 1: But I know certain websites that have like a lockpicking lawyer rule.

95
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:51,600
Speaker 1: It's like they can't post another lockpicking lawyer video until he does something more ridiculous than the previous time they posted his video.

96
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:55,175
Speaker 0: I think Sausage Man has that there with, all right, you're going to beat water?

97
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,360
Speaker 0: You're going to beat nothing?

98
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,987
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like we already posted sausage.

99
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,589
Speaker 1: We're good.

100
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,220
Speaker 1: You can check out all the sausages now on your own.

101
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:02,680
Speaker 0: Yep.

102
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:06,769
Speaker 0: But actually, the guy who does historical food just did a really good one.

103
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:11,519
Speaker 0: that was like surprisingly good about a guy who died due to lobster, but in a really sad and funny way.

104
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:11,800
Speaker 0: Anyway.

105
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,960
Speaker 1: But it was by the claw or the magnet.

106
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,423
Speaker 0: This was in the Louis XIV era.

107
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:29,857
Speaker 0: But the one thing I will say about this whole GameStop thing is that the details of it are interesting, but they're not the message to take away.

108
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:32,160
Speaker 0: Short selling is not the thing to focus on.

109
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,983
Speaker 0: There is only one thing to focus on.

110
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:38,131
Speaker 0: This is the question you should ask yourself and think about in this whole realm.

111
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,580
Speaker 0: What should the stock market do for society?

112
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,220
Speaker 1: Well, should it exist?

113
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:51,930
Speaker 0: Well, if the idea of a stock market is going to exist at all, one, what purpose does it serve for society?

114
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:54,614
Speaker 0: Two, is it serving that purpose well?

115
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:58,780
Speaker 0: And three, what do we need to do to make it serve that purpose well?

116
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,326
Speaker 0: That is the only conversation that matters.

117
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:03,632
Speaker 0: Everything else is just political hobbyism.

118
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:05,377
Speaker 0: You're enjoying the spectacle.

119
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,540
Speaker 0: You're not doing anything.

120
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,495
Speaker 1: I am enjoying the spectacle.

121
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:08,920
Speaker 1: You're right.

122
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:13,951
Speaker 0: When it hit 420.69, I will not pretend that I didn't laugh out loud a lot.

123
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:15,494
Speaker 1: I thought that was a Photoshop.

124
00:06:15,695 --> 00:06:16,536
Speaker 0: I think that really happened.

125
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:18,180
Speaker 1: I'll check.

126
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,655
Speaker 0: It got above that, so there must have been a point where the tick was that for a brief moment, though it could be wrong because the spread was actually weirdly wide.

127
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:27,098
Speaker 0: But anyway, we're not going to talk about that.

128
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,040
Speaker 0: Here's some news.

129
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:38,380
Speaker 1: Oh, it must have at one point because the highest peak was 468.49, so it did hit it for like probably a fraction of a second, some moment in time like yesterday.

130
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,586
Speaker 0: So you might remember Otacon.

131
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,279
Speaker 0: It was the second to last anime convention we still went to.

132
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,025
Speaker 1: We went to it seven or eight times.

133
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:50,573
Speaker 1: We went to it from 2002, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

134
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:53,360
Speaker 1: We went to it eight times, 2002 through 2009.

135
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,064
Speaker 0: It was a big moment.

136
00:06:56,085 --> 00:07:05,940
Speaker 0: There was a time when we had done so many panels at Otacons that like Otacon was more panels we had done than literally every other con we'd ever been to in our lives combined.

137
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:10,249
Speaker 1: We were going to it earlier than other cons.

138
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,020
Speaker 0: We were doing like five or six panels at a given Otacon sometimes.

139
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,136
Speaker 1: We were doing panels there before we did Geek Nights even.

140
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:20,383
Speaker 1: 2002. 2002,

141
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:21,104
Speaker 1: three, four.

142
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:22,267
Speaker 1: Geek Nights didn't start until 2005.

143
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,852
Speaker 1: We didn't start going to PAX until 2008 and PAX was like, "Hey, do one

144
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:25,073
Speaker 1: panel.".

145
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,892
Speaker 0: Otacon was like, "Can you do

146
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:30,275
Speaker 0: eight?".

147
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:34,771
Speaker 1: We submitted all kinds of stuff.

148
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:36,380
Speaker 1: I never remember what all those panels were.

149
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,460
Speaker 1: I have a list.

150
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,559
Speaker 1: We did an Advance Wars panel there.

151
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:41,420
Speaker 0: While we're talking, I'll pull up the list.

152
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:50,220
Speaker 0: Anyway, Otacon is in a little bit of trouble and I don't think they're going to survive this.

153
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,883
Speaker 1: I don't have any inside information.

154
00:07:52,923 --> 00:08:00,680
Speaker 1: I just have the general knowledge we have from being a United States fan convention, somewhat experts, sort of.

155
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,911
Speaker 0: Also, we're in that sphere like we used to perform there.

156
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,120
Speaker 0: We were technically staffed there for a brief period.

157
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:09,272
Speaker 1: But I haven't talked to anyone from Otacon in how many years?

158
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:11,100
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell is going on there specifically.

159
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:12,260
Speaker 0: We stopped going.

160
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,027
Speaker 1: We moved to a new building.

161
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,080
Speaker 1: I've never even seen that new building.

162
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,771
Speaker 0: When I imagine Otacon, in fact, when I was talking about it, I keep wanting to say Baltimore.

163
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:22,060
Speaker 0: It hasn't been in Baltimore for a long time.

164
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:27,028
Speaker 1: Obviously, they didn't have Otacon last year.

165
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,975
Speaker 1: If they sold any tickets, I don't even know.

166
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:32,159
Speaker 1: if they did, they had to refund them probably.

167
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:43,879
Speaker 1: I know it's a nonprofit organization, so the only thing that could cost them money if they're not having the convention would be taxes.

168
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,820
Speaker 1: You don't have low taxes.

169
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,480
Speaker 0: Salaries for the few employees you have that are permanent employees of the company.

170
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,460
Speaker 1: Any permanent employees or any sort of contracts you might have to outside people that you have to pay.

171
00:08:55,761 --> 00:09:00,931
Speaker 1: Maybe they have a Google Suite account for the Otacon email.

172
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:01,793
Speaker 1: They have to pay that bill.

173
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:05,200
Speaker 1: Maybe they have a website that's being hosted to pay that bill.

174
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,013
Speaker 1: There's bills you have to pay just for having a company to exist even if you're not doing any fucking business.

175
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:13,780
Speaker 1: Even if they might be relatively small.

176
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:27,640
Speaker 1: So, the thing is, those kinds of bills, if you don't do any business, you just chill, especially if you're nonprofit, you don't need profits, and you don't have employees with salaries, or at least not a lot of them, is kind of small.

177
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,944
Speaker 1: You can just wait it out.

178
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,772
Speaker 1: But Otacon is saying, "Oh,

179
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:31,073
Speaker 1: no.".

180
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:32,800
Speaker 1: This is publicly, they've said this.

181
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:34,022
Speaker 1: "Oh, no.

182
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:38,752
Speaker 1: They started to work on 2021 Otacon.

183
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:40,395
Speaker 1: It might not happen.

184
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:42,239
Speaker 1: I think it's unlikely to happen in my personal

185
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:42,580
Speaker 1: opinion.".

186
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:53,958
Speaker 1: And they need, they're publicly expressing that they fear that if Otacon 2021 doesn't happen, then never, Otacon might just never happen again.

187
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:55,060
Speaker 1: They just admitted that.

188
00:09:56,241 --> 00:10:02,480
Speaker 1: Which signals to me, there must be some expense that they need the money for they can't avoid.

189
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:13,700
Speaker 1: And the most likely thing is something you've mentioned on our show before, which is, if you have a contract with the convention center, and you can't get out of it by canceling, unless...

190
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:15,200
Speaker 0: And the government doesn't give you cover.

191
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:22,280
Speaker 1: Right, there is some sort of cover, like you've been forced to cancel by an act of outside forces beyond your control, right?

192
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:28,600
Speaker 1: And I think I've told the story about the laser light show when I was in first grade, where...

193
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,820
Speaker 0: That's like a Geek Nights trope at this point, that story.

194
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, right?

195
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:36,680
Speaker 1: The school, elementary school, hired someone to come in and put on a laser light show for the kids.

196
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,286
Speaker 1: And in the contract, they signed with this person.

197
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:43,600
Speaker 1: They said that they would provide a room that was incredibly dark, right?

198
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,400
Speaker 1: Or a certain amount of darkness so that the show would look good.

199
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,179
Speaker 1: They could not make, they put like black construction paper over the windows in the gymnasium.

200
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:57,140
Speaker 1: And it was not dark enough, so the person came in, looked at the room, left, and the school still had to pay them.

201
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:59,360
Speaker 1: And somehow I understood that in first grade.

202
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:07,076
Speaker 1: And I think my guess is that's the situation Otacon is in, that unless the government of some D.C.

203
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:10,102
Speaker 1: or federal government or someone, mayor of

204
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:10,663
Speaker 1: D.C.,

205
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:26,140
Speaker 1: forces them to not hold Otacon 2021 and they simply choose not to hold it, or hold it but no one shows up, or they can't get enough staff or they just can't hold it, then they will still have to pay the convention center for the weekend and not have that money.

206
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:28,155
Speaker 1: And therefore, that will be the end of Otacon.

207
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:28,820
Speaker 1: It will be bankrupt.

208
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:31,619
Speaker 1: And they're asking for donations.

209
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:41,659
Speaker 0: Actually, there's a quote here of exactly what they said was, "We use the proceeds from each year to plan the next Otacon and make sure we survive until

210
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:41,859
Speaker 0: then.".

211
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:49,880
Speaker 0: So without the income from Otacon 2020 and the early pre-registrations we would normally see at this time of year, we're in a very precarious position.

212
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,880
Speaker 0: Put it simply, in the next few months we will have to make the decision to continue planning for Otacon 2021 or potentially close our doors forever.

213
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,516
Speaker 0: So yeah, it really sounds like if they do not run Otacon 2021 physically, they're gone.

214
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:05,720
Speaker 0: And they're asking for donations.

215
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:21,720
Speaker 0: I question the value of donating to them in the sense that if they can't survive without 2021 happening, I can't imagine fans would donate enough money to undo that "can't survive" statement.

216
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:23,665
Speaker 1: It is a crowded con.

217
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:28,480
Speaker 1: There are a lot of people who support it, but that number has been going down to my knowledge.

218
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,518
Speaker 1: Yeah, they didn't hit the caps they used to.

219
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:37,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the last time I looked, which has been actually a few years, let's take a look here, they have it on their website there.

220
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,585
Speaker 0: Yup, I remember when we went.

221
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,271
Speaker 0: it was like 26,000 uniques?

222
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:42,920
Speaker 0: Something like that?

223
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,420
Speaker 1: Here we go, event statistics.

224
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,800
Speaker 1: 2019, the unique memberships were 28 for 30.

225
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,096
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's down, it's peak, we're like in the 30s.

226
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,486
Speaker 1: So 28 is actually up.

227
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:59,740
Speaker 1: 2017 was low, it was like 24, 894.

228
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,251
Speaker 1: And in fact, when we went in 2009, it was 26.

229
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:04,059
Speaker 1: So it's up from where we were.

230
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:11,520
Speaker 1: So it's not too bad, they only had, you know, they actually had a bunch of big ups and downs.

231
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,622
Speaker 1: Like negative 20% in 2015, right?

232
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:19,640
Speaker 1: Up almost 10% in 2016, down 15% in 2017.

233
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,840
Speaker 0: It's funny, if you showed me those numbers for taxes, I could probably speculate on exactly what was happening year by year, but I just don't know.

234
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:29,425
Speaker 1: Wild fluctuations here.

235
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:36,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what caused the ups and downs of the different years, but there you have it.

236
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,880
Speaker 0: The other thing that worries me, there was a statement added that the staff remained "hopeful" alongside the rollout of the vaccines.

237
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,099
Speaker 0: And they're exploring with "partners in DC to explore options to safely gather later this

238
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:49,340
Speaker 0: year.".

239
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:50,885
Speaker 0: That really worries me.

240
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:55,000
Speaker 0: that they're banking on being able to run in person, or not at all specifically.

241
00:13:56,241 --> 00:14:09,320
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, sometimes, it's like for us, whenever I'm thinking about anything, I always calculate the value of one human life to be infinity.

242
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:17,680
Speaker 1: So it's like, if I had some business that I'd worked my whole life for, I guess I can't say that because I haven't had one.

243
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,980
Speaker 1: But it's like, I would just let it all go away to save one person's life.

244
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,002
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing.

245
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:25,548
Speaker 1: At least in principle, but I haven't done that.

246
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:31,060
Speaker 1: So other people who have big things that they've worked for and built up, right?

247
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,980
Speaker 1: It's like, I guess Geek Nights, I couldn't save someone's life by sacrificing Geek Nights.

248
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:46,140
Speaker 1: If you've built something over a long time, you can end up valuing it more than other things, and it could change your judgement.

249
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:50,880
Speaker 0: Nerd cons are different because the thing is the convention happening and the people.

250
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:56,160
Speaker 0: But the appetite for nerd conventions is nearly limitless.

251
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:09,378
Speaker 0: And if, say Otacon went bankrupt, and the people who ran Otacon in a year or two, like when COVID, when we're post-COVID era, they spit up a new con called something else, and everyone just knows, "Oh yeah, this is just what replaced

252
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:09,800
Speaker 0: Otacon.".

253
00:15:10,183 --> 00:15:11,940
Speaker 0: I think the same people would just show up.

254
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:20,740
Speaker 1: I don't even know what, even if they go bankrupt, it's like, okay, and you have all the exact same people just form a brand new nonprofit that does the exact same thing.

255
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,688
Speaker 1: You could even call it like,

256
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:22,556
Speaker 1: "Tutacon.".

257
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:29,100
Speaker 0: You could even crowdsource pre-orders for the first one to get that before money that we always talk about.

258
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,220
Speaker 1: Right, and then it's like, what are they actually losing?

259
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,111
Speaker 0: They might lose the trademarks, and they couldn't call it Otacon.

260
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:39,660
Speaker 0: They'd lose the professional relationships they have.

261
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,919
Speaker 0: But the people who foster those relationships in nerd conventions...

262
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,728
Speaker 1: Would they, right?

263
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:50,640
Speaker 1: As long as they have the same people on staff, what relationships do they lose?

264
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,857
Speaker 1: You just call up someone and you go, "Yeah, our old company had to go bankrupt because of the COVID.

265
00:15:54,877 --> 00:15:55,479
Speaker 1: You know how life

266
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:55,660
Speaker 1: is.".

267
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,523
Speaker 1: "It's still me.

268
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,174
Speaker 0: Here's my new email address.

269
00:15:59,375 --> 00:15:59,839
Speaker 0: @Otacon.".

270
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, @Ootacon.

271
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,937
Speaker 0: Otacon with a C.

272
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:06,078
Speaker 1: Right, .org, whatever.

273
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:07,489
Speaker 0: Otacon.

274
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,099
Speaker 0: They actually finally make it Otacon.

275
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:12,038
Speaker 0: Otacon.

276
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:13,790
Speaker 1: Metal Gear.

277
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:14,278
Speaker 1: Anyway.

278
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,720
Speaker 0: But basically, I think it's like any nerd convention, there's two things going on here.

279
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:27,300
Speaker 0: One, the whole point of having a nonprofit or an LLC or whatever it is you structured is that you are not the con.

280
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,406
Speaker 0: You can just let the con fail.

281
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:31,051
Speaker 0: Just everyone resigns.

282
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:33,680
Speaker 0: The con's gone, and start a new one later.

283
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:38,180
Speaker 0: And the creditors gotta sort out what to do with the assets or any money owed or anything.

284
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like why don't they just take whatever they've got, stop doing anything, and just call up a bankruptcy lawyer.

285
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,299
Speaker 1: Give them your remaining monies to help you sort this out and just be like, "Listen, we just want to be able to have this convention

286
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:50,480
Speaker 1: again.".

287
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,193
Speaker 1: "We don't even give a shit if we lose all these

288
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:52,657
Speaker 1: assets.".

289
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,474
Speaker 1: "We just figure it out for

290
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:54,676
Speaker 1: us.".

291
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,320
Speaker 0: There's also an opportunity.

292
00:16:57,361 --> 00:17:05,380
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say this applies to Otacon, but it is my opinion that this applies to a lot of nerd conventions.

293
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:20,159
Speaker 0: Over time, because of the way nerd conventions get founded, especially older ones, they tend to accrue people who might be full of some drama, or some people who might be actually making the con worse or holding it back, and it's often very hard to dislodge them.

294
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:39,980
Speaker 0: A convention just going bankrupt and the people who are dedicated enough to do the work to make a new con out of the ashes after COVID might be able to shed some of that dead weight and shed some of the old ideas of how to run cons, structure themselves better, and actually make a better convention.

295
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:51,080
Speaker 1: That is a good strategy, but it requires a strong marketing team or PR team to make sure that the people know.

296
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,533
Speaker 1: The people who don't know anything about your drama know that your con, the new one, is the real one.

297
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,559
Speaker 0: Here's how I think that's easy.

298
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:03,868
Speaker 1: There have been a lot of forks in the past.

299
00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:10,368
Speaker 1: One that I know in the bicycling world is there's this famous bike ride called the Ragbri, which is basically you bike across Iowa.

300
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,700
Speaker 1: My friend did it, I would not do it because I don't want to go to fucking Iowa.

301
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:29,440
Speaker 1: But it was a famous, famous ride, it had drama, and I believe, I haven't read too much about it since it happened, but that it basically forked, and there were like now two different rides and battles sort of like over which one's the real one, which one's run by the not shitty people.

302
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:40,520
Speaker 0: But I think nerd cons, that gets sorted out real quick, and also it's easy because every time there's a new nerd con, it hits its cav immediately because people are so desperate for conventions, even pre-Covid.

303
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,780
Speaker 0: Like brand new cons, a big part of why they often failed was that a brand new con would have 10,000 people show up, even if they didn't advertise.

304
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,720
Speaker 1: Anyway, so that's a big news there.

305
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a whole, that's a big one.

306
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,184
Speaker 1: The latest con drama.

307
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,690
Speaker 1: Just one more news, right?

308
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:09,900
Speaker 1: So I was real excited, you know, we talked about sports in the opening bit a little bit, but you know, women's hockey has been growing over the years, I've been following it since, you know, I guess it was in college, right?

309
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:24,618
Speaker 1: But more so when they started the NWHL a few years ago, and this year they decided that what they were going to do with the NWHL was to make a little bubble in Lake Placid, a great place, I've been there, where the Olympics were.

310
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,140
Speaker 1: Rambi would probably like it, the skiing.

311
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:29,439
Speaker 0: I've been to Lake Placid many times.

312
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,744
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

313
00:19:32,286 --> 00:19:40,027
Speaker 1: And basically they said, yeah, we'll just bubble all the women's hockey players here for two weeks, play a whole shit ton of hockey, give out the Isabel Cup and go home all safe-like, right?

314
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:49,840
Speaker 1: So I'm like, oh, okay, you know, it's on Twitch, all the games are on Twitch, and the final games were going to be on NBCSN, which is going to die, that's a news for another time.

315
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,313
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I was watching it on Twitch, right?

316
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:55,519
Speaker 1: You know, having a good time.

317
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:59,510
Speaker 1: And then of course, drama, right?

318
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,215
Speaker 1: So what drama has happened?

319
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:02,780
Speaker 1: There is so much drama.

320
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:12,746
Speaker 1: So first of all, there's the existing pre-drama of women's hockey in that there is an organization that is not a labor union, but is sort of close to it, kind of.

321
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:18,980
Speaker 1: It's the PWHPA, the Pro Women's Hockey Player Association, I think.

322
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:20,240
Speaker 0: Something like that.

323
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,140
Speaker 1: And it's basically some of the best, actually, women's hockey players in the US and Canada.

324
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:33,534
Speaker 1: And they're basically like, yeah, NWHL is BS, we're just going to do our own thing over here, right?

325
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:36,020
Speaker 1: So that's a thing.

326
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:41,171
Speaker 1: And then you've got this other organization, right?

327
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:44,020
Speaker 1: You may have heard of it, it's called Barstool Sports.

328
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,700
Speaker 1: And I try not to write its full name on the internet, because the trolls might see you, so usually I'll type "bar" and then the poop emoji.

329
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,582
Speaker 0: Well, it'll be real blunt.

330
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:54,253
Speaker 0: Barstool Sports is like the dog shit tier of sports journalism.

331
00:20:54,915 --> 00:20:56,600
Speaker 0: Like, they're absolute dog shit.

332
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,320
Speaker 1: Barstool Sports is a racist and misogynist organization that puts out awful content.

333
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:08,980
Speaker 1: There's like whole Twitter accounts dedicated to showing you the people that work there, saying the n-word.

334
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,437
Speaker 1: There's just an awful place with awful people, awful culture, awful fans.

335
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:14,040
Speaker 1: It's bad.

336
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,885
Speaker 1: But it's somehow gained, right?

337
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:24,680
Speaker 1: It's basically sort of replaced that old sports talk radio, which still exists to some extent.

338
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:30,333
Speaker 1: Those people who would listen to the radio in their car, right?

339
00:21:30,474 --> 00:21:32,220
Speaker 1: And I think COVID helped them out even more.

340
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:38,639
Speaker 1: They didn't need help, they're already big before COVID, but have moved to listening to sports talk podcasts instead, right?

341
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:56,213
Speaker 1: And Barstool became the place that had a whole bunch of podcasts for all the major sports with all sorts of toxically masculine racist people, you know, doing sort of morning show talk radio type culture.

342
00:21:56,253 --> 00:21:59,460
Speaker 1: You're calling in and complaining about the coach or whatever, right?

343
00:22:01,341 --> 00:22:03,607
Speaker 1: Like there is in sports, all those kinds of problems.

344
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:08,740
Speaker 1: And what you have is you have some people in sports, right?

345
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,320
Speaker 1: Like I've even seen like Henrik Lundqvist being interviewed on like a Barstool podcast one time, right?

346
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,964
Speaker 1: It's like, I don't even know if he knows.

347
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,890
Speaker 1: It's like, what's going on there?

348
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:21,260
Speaker 1: I didn't listen to it, but I saw he was on there and I was disappointed.

349
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:23,564
Speaker 1: So I don't know what he said.

350
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:25,933
Speaker 1: If he came back at them or who knows?

351
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:27,680
Speaker 1: If they even said anything bad on that show, right?

352
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,021
Speaker 1: It's not like.

353
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:33,239
Speaker 1: every episode they put out contains, you know, racism, but the whole organization itself is inherently bad.

354
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:42,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is almost worse because a lot of like generic sports fans don't see the bad side of Barstool and then they get weird when people criticize Barstool.

355
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,341
Speaker 1: Yeah.

356
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,465
Speaker 1: I mean, it would make sense, right?

357
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:49,040
Speaker 1: It's like if you've, you know, I'm sure there's probably, you know, they have so many shows, I don't even know all the shows.

358
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,369
Speaker 1: I'm sure that some of those shows, the hosts are probably not bad.

359
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,340
Speaker 1: They're just working there on their show at the organization, right?

360
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:02,092
Speaker 1: And then if you only listen to that show, you wouldn't know that the network itself is bad.

361
00:23:02,373 --> 00:23:05,800
Speaker 1: And the network also, you know, they're doing that sort of cover thing, right?

362
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,527
Speaker 1: Where they have some sort of charity they have.

363
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,655
Speaker 1: It's like Barstool charity of some kind, right?

364
00:23:09,675 --> 00:23:10,880
Speaker 1: Just sort of make themselves look good.

365
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:15,388
Speaker 0: A lot of the Dirtbag Left podcasts do that similar thing.

366
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:19,700
Speaker 0: Like they'll donate to trans rights causes, but are actively anti-trans and what they actually say and do.

367
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:20,781
Speaker 1: Yep.

368
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:21,402
Speaker 1: Stuff like that.

369
00:23:21,522 --> 00:23:23,005
Speaker 1: So anyway, that exists over there.

370
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:30,640
Speaker 1: So what happened is in the NWHL, there is an amazing player on the Newark Riveters, our team, right?

371
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,555
Speaker 1: Soroya Tinker, who is a black person, you know, and she was like, post things on Twitter, right?

372
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:40,740
Speaker 1: So on her Twitter account, I follow her on Twitter.

373
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:47,140
Speaker 1: So it was like, she was like, she posted a photo of like, you know, her and some of the teammates kneeling during the national anthem.

374
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:51,731
Speaker 1: And she was like, I know that even the teammates who were standing, we all support each other.

375
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:53,656
Speaker 1: It was like, oh, how great is this team?

376
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:54,999
Speaker 1: How nice, right?

377
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:55,380
Speaker 1: Yay.

378
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,742
Speaker 1: Women's hockey, right?

379
00:23:57,364 --> 00:24:04,460
Speaker 1: And then, right, apparently like some NWHL people like appeared on some Barstool podcast and she called them shit out.

380
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,079
Speaker 0: Correctly called them out.

381
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:08,785
Speaker 1: And then Barstool's coming, right?

382
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:16,200
Speaker 1: Posting like the CEO of Barstool, who is a woman, but that doesn't make it impossible for them to be misogynist or racist.

383
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:19,285
Speaker 1: Post like a video on Twitter, right?

384
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:25,217
Speaker 1: Like calling basically for targeted harassment of, you know, people, right?

385
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:26,940
Speaker 1: In the NWHL and others, right?

386
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,745
Speaker 1: And basically huge ass drama going on, right?

387
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:32,348
Speaker 1: Within the team, right?

388
00:24:32,408 --> 00:24:40,800
Speaker 1: You know, and with external to the league and it just basically put a dark cloud over what was starting out as basically the nicest sport that was happening.

389
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,427
Speaker 1: This little two week bubble now had a dark cloud over it.

390
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:44,350
Speaker 1: And you know what?

391
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:45,895
Speaker 1: You didn't think it could get worse.

392
00:24:46,476 --> 00:24:47,640
Speaker 1: The cloud got darker.

393
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:53,420
Speaker 1: The Riveters, that same team, our team, the team from the New York area.

394
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:54,082
Speaker 0: Yep.

395
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:54,745
Speaker 0: Pulled out.

396
00:24:55,748 --> 00:24:57,816
Speaker 1: They pulled, someone got COVID or something.

397
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,780
Speaker 1: They didn't, I don't know.

398
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:03,820
Speaker 0: All we know, they pulled out due to quote health and safety concerns pretty suddenly.

399
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:04,981
Speaker 1: Yeah.

400
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:10,040
Speaker 0: They just suddenly came back to the bench, like after a period ended and then they were out.

401
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:11,102
Speaker 1: Yeah.

402
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,640
Speaker 1: It's like the team, it's like someone must have had a positive COVID test or something.

403
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,940
Speaker 1: So the whole team just got up and left the bubble and they're going to continue playing with the remaining five teams.

404
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:23,630
Speaker 1: Uh, so yeah, super like.

405
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:26,119
Speaker 1: now it's pitch black and there's so many dark clouds going on.

406
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,480
Speaker 0: But all I'll say is whatever reason they have, I respect that because they get to choose if they feel safe playing or not.

407
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,042
Speaker 1: Obviously.

408
00:25:34,062 --> 00:25:36,227
Speaker 1: I'm not the one to stop playing.

409
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,673
Speaker 1: But it's still, it's just disappointing.

410
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:44,189
Speaker 1: that like, you know, you, it's like, you know, there's a little engine that could come on women's hockey, you can do it.

411
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:57,360
Speaker 1: And it's just hitting like so many, not, you know, it's already enough to go over the hurdles of just, you know, the sexism inherent in society to climb over and especially within sports to climb over that.

412
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,048
Speaker 1: And some of the hurdles that they're facing are that.

413
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:04,360
Speaker 1: But then there's additional roadblocks in the way as well.

414
00:26:05,183 --> 00:26:07,316
Speaker 1: And it's just like, ah, it's so disappointing.

415
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:07,899
Speaker 1: What can I do?

416
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,600
Speaker 0: It sucks because I remember like I was Emily and I were at the first time the Isabel Cup was awarded.

417
00:26:14,502 --> 00:26:18,060
Speaker 0: And it was just this feeling of like, yeah, women's hockey might be having its moment.

418
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:25,920
Speaker 0: And it's just, it keeps like not being able to lift off because of all these problems that the players have almost no control over at all.

419
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:30,920
Speaker 0: They're basically fighting like capitalism and like the institutional sexism of sports.

420
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:37,698
Speaker 0: And now COVID, like everything is just conspiring to keep them from rising up to where they really brightly deserve.

421
00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:38,420
Speaker 0: This hockey is great.

422
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:39,544
Speaker 1: Yeah.

423
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:44,039
Speaker 1: And you can't even get like, you know, they can't even like reach WNBA level.

424
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:44,460
Speaker 1: Right.

425
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,065
Speaker 1: It's like WNBA.

426
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,653
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they exist.

427
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,820
Speaker 1: They've been playing for a super long time.

428
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,464
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's legit.

429
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:53,106
Speaker 1: Right.

430
00:26:54,309 --> 00:27:03,614
Speaker 1: But it seems like somehow they have less problems than women's hockey, which is trying to make a professional league many years later than the WNBA did it.

431
00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:05,860
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

432
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:06,482
Speaker 0: All right.

433
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:13,160
Speaker 0: So before we get to the things today, I did dig up the recurring panels we used to do at Otacon are the Anime Club Summit.

434
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:14,745
Speaker 1: Yeah, we know that one.

435
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:16,532
Speaker 0: The Podcasters Roundtable.

436
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:17,155
Speaker 0: Remember that?

437
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:17,677
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

438
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,191
Speaker 1: I guess I don't remember any one of doing those, but I guess we did.

439
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:23,320
Speaker 0: There's pictures of us and Dave and Joel.

440
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,623
Speaker 1: I'm sure there are.

441
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:30,340
Speaker 0: Cover Your Bases, Anime You Should See, Know Your Creators, Comics for the Manga Reader.

442
00:27:30,762 --> 00:27:32,247
Speaker 0: Right.

443
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:33,893
Speaker 1: I remember that one.

444
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:34,234
Speaker 1: Yeah.

445
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:35,880
Speaker 0: Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

446
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:36,861
Speaker 1: All right.

447
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:38,068
Speaker 1: We did do that at Otacon.

448
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:38,510
Speaker 1: Yeah.

449
00:27:38,631 --> 00:27:40,280
Speaker 0: We were like, should we call it Beyond Besom?

450
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,226
Speaker 0: And even they were like, nobody knows what Besom is.

451
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,511
Speaker 0: OK.

452
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:46,240
Speaker 1: We did the Advanced Wars one once.

453
00:27:46,702 --> 00:27:48,340
Speaker 0: Advanced Wars, which I will never forget.

454
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:57,280
Speaker 0: That was a formative moment when I realized the like weird amount of authority that people will give a white person who's on a stage without knowing anything about them.

455
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:01,640
Speaker 0: When the audience clearly thought we made Advanced Wars.

456
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:15,700
Speaker 0: And despite us telling them we did not and being very clear that we were just two nerds with a podcast, the questions they asked us were the questions that a nerd would ask like Nintendo about a game.

457
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, how would we know?

458
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,500
Speaker 1: It's like the only reason we know anything.

459
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,244
Speaker 1: You know, I keep reiterating this.

460
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:25,034
Speaker 1: I guess people listen to geek days know this already, but it's like the only reason I look like.

461
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:27,060
Speaker 1: I know what all this stuff is because I read it on the Internet.

462
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,341
Speaker 0: Yeah.

463
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:32,180
Speaker 0: If you're watching the live stream, you can see me looking shit up live to say on geek nights.

464
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,446
Speaker 1: For the most part, I can not.

465
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:35,189
Speaker 1: I'm not perfect.

466
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:35,731
Speaker 1: No one is.

467
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:37,960
Speaker 1: For the most part, I can tell what's real and what's not.

468
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:40,207
Speaker 1: I know how to go to Snopes or whatever.

469
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:43,900
Speaker 1: And then I learned that I read a lot of Internet constantly.

470
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:46,009
Speaker 1: So I know things because of that.

471
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:48,460
Speaker 1: I don't actually have inside knowledge or anything.

472
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:57,500
Speaker 1: But if I encounter someone who's never read any Internet, it's like, you know, you can sound like, you know, there's so much stuff to them, right?

473
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:07,420
Speaker 1: Because they don't know those things, not because they're unintelligent, just because they haven't gone through this constant work of plugging their brain into the Internet and constantly informing themselves about everything.

474
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,445
Speaker 0: Always the time, including a lot of really stupid crap.

475
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:18,980
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

476
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:24,079
Speaker 0: So this is, you know, I ski like skiing is actually one of my primary hobbies.

477
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:26,187
Speaker 0: Scott does not ski.

478
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:26,851
Speaker 0: That's fine.

479
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:27,496
Speaker 0: But I ski.

480
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:28,120
Speaker 0: Emily skis.

481
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:39,700
Speaker 0: But if you've never skied and you watch a movie that involves skiing, they usually show like the fancy gondola, people like skiing down a really well-groomed slope.

482
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:45,760
Speaker 0: And then they show people well-dressed, hanging out in fancy looking lodges, sipping cocktails and drinking beers.

483
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:51,100
Speaker 0: And like they imply this level of elegance to like what it's actually like to ski.

484
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:58,920
Speaker 0: So what this video is, it's an old video I just found randomly called "Shit Skiers Say" from like 2012.

485
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,765
Speaker 0: This is what skiing is actually like.

486
00:30:01,006 --> 00:30:03,774
Speaker 0: The lodges look like shit.

487
00:30:03,794 --> 00:30:06,040
Speaker 0: They all look like they were built in the 70s because most of them were.

488
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:26,620
Speaker 0: It's just this like farce of people like walking awkwardly and ill-fitting boots and tripping down stairs trying to carry beverages, eating the worst food you can imagine in like high school cafeteria looking like tables for like 30 bucks a plate, covered in mucus, trying to get GoPros to work and they're not working.

489
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,434
Speaker 0: Like skiing is just this mucus covered, uncomfortable mess.

490
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:31,960
Speaker 0: But it's also super fun.

491
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:41,100
Speaker 0: So I'm using this as my thing of the day just to let you see like the reality of skiing that people who ski a lot don't often tell non-skiers about.

492
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,977
Speaker 0: Like they don't want to tell you like, yeah, I'm literally just my face is covered in mucus the entire time.

493
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:47,820
Speaker 0: It is disgusting.

494
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,475
Speaker 1: When you mentioned that, you know, skiing in movies, I always think of James Bond skiing, right?

495
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:54,899
Speaker 1: And like, you know...

496
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,446
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know exactly where you are.

497
00:30:56,466 --> 00:30:59,540
Speaker 0: The end of Inception on the snowmobiles, like that kind of skiing.

498
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:06,600
Speaker 1: Right, but I was saying like James Bond skiing always looked like some sort of, you know, he'd always probably be getting chased by someone trying to kill him.

499
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,030
Speaker 1: But it was always like a luxurious like place.

500
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,453
Speaker 1: There was not a lot of people there, right?

501
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:15,320
Speaker 1: It would like be just him, you know, and like a few other people.

502
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:22,359
Speaker 0: Some places do look luxurious, but the people are all dressed like shit, are dirty and smelly and like it's...

503
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:28,380
Speaker 1: If I could go James Bond skiing and like, I guess James Bond was usually skiing in like the Alps or something.

504
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:35,615
Speaker 1: But if I could do that, I probably still wouldn't, but I would be more likely to.

505
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:38,040
Speaker 1: It would increase the percentage chance of skiing.

506
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,284
Speaker 1: Anyway, so my thing of the day.

507
00:31:40,324 --> 00:31:45,980
Speaker 1: So this thing of the day, there's this guy, Bruce Wang, the Chinese cowboy question mark.

508
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:52,000
Speaker 1: I don't know Bruce's story because he hasn't told it or I haven't watched every video on his channel.

509
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:59,155
Speaker 1: But he is a person apparently of Chinese descent and someone who had to learn English, right?

510
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:01,060
Speaker 1: English is not Bruce's first language.

511
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:10,680
Speaker 1: But if you watch Bruce's video, he is extremely fluent in English, way more than you would expect of someone where English is their second language.

512
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:25,180
Speaker 1: And he is fluent in English with a southern accent, which is, you know, unusual for someone like me who lives in the northern part of the United States to encounter someone where English is their second language.

513
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:31,800
Speaker 1: And I don't, you know, usually when someone English is their second language, their accent comes from the place that they're from.

514
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,892
Speaker 1: I guess it's true even if, you know, English is your first language.

515
00:32:36,093 --> 00:32:38,440
Speaker 1: If I learn French, I'm going to speak French.

516
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,099
Speaker 0: You sound like an American speaking French.

517
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:43,060
Speaker 1: I'm going to have a New York French accent, right?

518
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,922
Speaker 0: But couple that too with the whole.

519
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:56,920
Speaker 0: like the media accent, like the quote neutral, I'm making big finger quotes, American accent, like that Midwestern thing is what most people think of it here in popular media, especially outside of America.

520
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:57,860
Speaker 1: Right.

521
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,890
Speaker 1: But I know, for example, you know, pretty much every other language on earth has accents, right?

522
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:06,380
Speaker 1: But it would be akin to me learning Japanese and speaking with like the Osaka dialect.

523
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:06,902
Speaker 1: Right.

524
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:11,317
Speaker 1: So that alone is, you know, you don't encounter it very often.

525
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,120
Speaker 1: So it's very cool.

526
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:24,080
Speaker 1: But Bruce's videos, what he has a thesis and his thesis is like, hey, actually the nature of, you know, he's like, hey, listen, a lot of people who learn English as their second language have pronunciation issues.

527
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:24,544
Speaker 1: Right.

528
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:26,420
Speaker 1: Which is true for anyone who learns anything.

529
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,227
Speaker 1: That's fair.

530
00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:28,460
Speaker 0: Have you seen English?

531
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,661
Speaker 1: Yeah.

532
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,550
Speaker 1: It's like you have pronunciation issues no matter what you learn is your second language.

533
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:33,828
Speaker 1: English in particular.

534
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,271
Speaker 1: Yeah.

535
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:35,611
Speaker 0: Right.

536
00:33:36,232 --> 00:33:45,650
Speaker 1: But Bruce's thesis is that if you try to learn with the Southern accent, that it actually makes life easier in a lot of ways.

537
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:50,735
Speaker 1: And I guess he doesn't have a study to show this, but he himself is living proof.

538
00:33:50,896 --> 00:34:01,770
Speaker 1: because if you didn't see his face or have him tell you he was Chinese, if you just talk to him on the phone, you would think you were talking to a cowboy who was just born in Texas or wherever he is.

539
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:06,385
Speaker 1: So, yeah, making really awesome videos down there, Bruce.

540
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:07,429
Speaker 1: Keep it up.

541
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,190
Speaker 0: Yeah.

542
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:12,429
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, we'll talk about the book club book in the main bit.

543
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:16,434
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we got nothing.

544
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:25,010
Speaker 0: We're actually writing a few new panels, like getting ready for like a round of online conventions because we're pretty much assuming there really aren't going to be conventions this year physically.

545
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:35,885
Speaker 0: So that's something that is not going to be in the second half of the show because whenever we get a panel submitted and it's accepted, there's a hard deadline and nothing gets us to finish.

546
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:39,090
Speaker 0: something like consequences of not finishing that thing.

547
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,994
Speaker 0: We might do it at the last minute.

548
00:34:43,235 --> 00:34:49,427
Speaker 0: We have definitely put panels together and slides at Akan the day we then presented that panel.

549
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,230
Speaker 0: That has happened, but we didn't.

550
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,989
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we're still stuck inside.

551
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,932
Speaker 1: I don't know what's going on.

552
00:34:57,952 --> 00:34:58,032
Speaker 1: Yeah.

553
00:34:58,072 --> 00:34:58,393
Speaker 1: Just comment.

554
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:09,506
Speaker 1: If you're listening to this and you don't know who we are, whatever site it is that you like to use on the Internet, YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, I don't really post there.

555
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,230
Speaker 0: I guess we have a Facebook.

556
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:15,570
Speaker 1: The Facebook page still exists.

557
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,329
Speaker 0: We got the Patreon.

558
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:24,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can find us on the Internet wherever you like to use Internet, whatever service that is, we're probably there.

559
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:31,390
Speaker 1: Our podcast is available on Spotify, iTunes, Google Play, you know, all the places Amazon podcast.

560
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,669
Speaker 1: If anyone in the world uses that, I can't imagine anyone does.

561
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:36,633
Speaker 1: We're there.

562
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:37,857
Speaker 1: We are in those places.

563
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:40,185
Speaker 1: You can come and find more of our content in those places.

564
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,770
Speaker 1: Do it if you really want to.

00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,796
Speaker 1: We got a Discord server.

566
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:44,869
Speaker 1: We have a website with a forum on it.

Speaker 1: You can email us.

568
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:48,530
Speaker 1: My DMs are open.

569
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:51,430
Speaker 0: My DMs are actually, I realize, not open.

570
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,648
Speaker 0: But you can email us.

571
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,839
Speaker 0: Like geeknights@ferbrokrug.com just works.

572
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,830
Speaker 0: Scott's usually the one to respond, but I do see those emails.

573
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:01,834
Speaker 1: Yeah.

574
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:03,201
Speaker 1: OK, so that's us.

575
00:36:04,086 --> 00:36:04,850
Speaker 1: Let's go to the main bit.

576
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,510
Speaker 1: So we talk a lot on Geek Nights about shit talking.

577
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:12,570
Speaker 1: So what shit talking is, is when you say you're going to do something.

578
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:13,091
Speaker 1: Right.

579
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:16,930
Speaker 1: So usually some sort of grandiose plan or project of some kind.

580
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:20,323
Speaker 1: And then you don't do jack shit.

581
00:36:20,524 --> 00:36:21,468
Speaker 1: You don't do nothing.

582
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:21,950
Speaker 1: Right.

583
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,546
Speaker 1: But unfinished business is different.

584
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:25,050
Speaker 1: Right.

585
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,470
Speaker 1: Unfinished business is something you're actually doing.

586
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:36,370
Speaker 1: But you're having maybe a hard time finishing or you're definitely you're absolutely going to do it.

587
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:36,631
Speaker 1: Right.

588
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:37,796
Speaker 1: It's not a shit talk.

589
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:39,223
Speaker 1: You say you're going to and then you're not.

590
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:40,650
Speaker 1: It's like, no, you are going to do it.

591
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,352
Speaker 1: Yeah.

592
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:45,690
Speaker 1: You have like some sort of proof that you're going to do it, but you just you just can't get it done.

593
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:46,978
Speaker 1: Or you haven't started it yet.

594
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:47,522
Speaker 0: Did it.

595
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,530
Speaker 0: Got it pretty far.

596
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:50,937
Speaker 0: But there's something you cannot like.

597
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:54,350
Speaker 0: There's a piece that's missing that you have not been able to actually do.

598
00:36:54,832 --> 00:36:55,840
Speaker 0: It's not like you shit talk and never do anything.

599
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,889
Speaker 0: You can't finish it.

600
00:36:57,491 --> 00:36:59,480
Speaker 1: You just you've gone over the starting line.

601
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:00,123
Speaker 1: Shit talking.

602
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:01,530
Speaker 1: If you've gone over the starting line.

603
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:02,233
Speaker 1: Right.

604
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:05,270
Speaker 1: You have gone a long way past shit talking.

605
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:05,914
Speaker 0: Yeah.

606
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,624
Speaker 0: You are already better than most of us.

607
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:08,610
Speaker 1: Right.

608
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,339
Speaker 1: But if you haven't gotten to the finish line.

609
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:12,940
Speaker 1: Right.

610
00:37:13,602 --> 00:37:16,590
Speaker 1: Then you're unfinished business.

611
00:37:17,872 --> 00:37:18,052
Speaker 1: Right.

612
00:37:18,193 --> 00:37:23,930
Speaker 1: I guess if you go long enough, if you cross the starting line and wait long enough without doing anything, it might become shit talking again.

613
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,331
Speaker 0: Yeah.

614
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:26,538
Speaker 0: Some of those might apply here.

615
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,610
Speaker 0: I got a wide variety of things.

616
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:29,910
Speaker 1: Yeah.

617
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:30,232
Speaker 1: All right.

618
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:37,421
Speaker 1: So, you know, my original idea for this show was to talk about because on my shelf, I have a lot of books that I bought and haven't read yet.

619
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:43,829
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, we can just talk about all these books we haven't read, including the book club book that which we're definitely going to do.

620
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:44,652
Speaker 1: Right.

621
00:37:45,818 --> 00:37:47,105
Speaker 1: Just haven't gotten over the finish line.

622
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,049
Speaker 1: We got over the starting line.

623
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:55,549
Speaker 1: And rim was saying how basically other than the book club book, there is no you don't you don't buy books or like I buy.

624
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:56,936
Speaker 0: I want to read a book.

625
00:37:57,077 --> 00:37:59,090
Speaker 0: I just buy it and start reading it like straight away.

626
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:04,310
Speaker 0: But I've been reading almost entirely nonfiction during covid, as we've talked about on the show before.

627
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:09,230
Speaker 0: I like to read fiction when I travel and on commutes and subways and poop at work.

628
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:12,770
Speaker 0: But when I'm home, I tend to focus on other things naturally.

629
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:17,290
Speaker 0: And I have to actively fight that if I want to read fiction at home during covid.

630
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:18,910
Speaker 1: Yes.

631
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:19,692
Speaker 1: I should probably.

632
00:38:19,712 --> 00:38:22,478
Speaker 1: I'm going to guess I'm going to start that policy right now, because that's my already.

633
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:28,470
Speaker 1: my policy for video games is I only buy a video game if I'm going to literally install it and play it that second.

634
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:28,751
Speaker 1: Yeah.

635
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:28,971
Speaker 1: Right.

636
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:38,670
Speaker 0: Like this example of me and a friend of ours, we're talking about a book that it's a book that talks about say there's a difference between being informed about politics and actually being an effective activist.

637
00:38:38,871 --> 00:38:44,410
Speaker 0: And it's about a series of essays around like, what's the difference between like, are you a hobbyist or are you an activist?

638
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,090
Speaker 0: And if you find out you're a hobbyist, how do you make the leap for real specifically?

639
00:38:50,631 --> 00:38:52,970
Speaker 1: Usually involves spending a lot of time doing something else.

640
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,191
Speaker 1: Yeah.

641
00:38:53,251 --> 00:38:57,630
Speaker 0: The problem is a big part of it is like, oh, yeah, none of this shit applies to New York because machine politics are.

642
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,780
Speaker 0: But anyway, that's also.

643
00:39:00,102 --> 00:39:01,270
Speaker 0: New York is like its own world.

644
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:05,679
Speaker 0: But yeah, my policy for a lot of stuff like video games, everything is I have been very like.

645
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,030
Speaker 0: I buy the thing the moment I am about to start interacting with the thing.

646
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:15,729
Speaker 1: It's a good strategy, I think, for everything I'm going to I'm going to stick to it.

647
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:16,474
Speaker 1: Yeah.

648
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:19,250
Speaker 1: The only thing that can catch you right is the subscription services.

649
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:19,531
Speaker 1: Right.

650
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:20,535
Speaker 1: It's like I have Netflix.

651
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:24,110
Speaker 1: It's not like when I'm going to go to watch Netflix, subscribe, watch, unsubscribe.

652
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,329
Speaker 1: That's a pain in the ass.

653
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:31,910
Speaker 0: And, you know, the most common thing to watch on Netflix is just scroll through the things you could watch until it's too late and then don't watch anything.

654
00:39:32,392 --> 00:39:33,429
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.

655
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:39,390
Speaker 0: So I want to go all the way all the way back to a thing like we can jump around like recent things, old things.

656
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,977
Speaker 0: But the oldest thing that's a gig night's thing.

657
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:45,848
Speaker 0: that was unfinished business that I was thinking about when Scott proposed the show idea was.

658
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:55,210
Speaker 0: You might have noticed for a long time that the gig night's URL is a front row crew dot com, and it's the front row crew forum.

659
00:39:55,671 --> 00:40:04,610
Speaker 0: When we started gig nights, we actually put some work into making it such that our Web site and all our stuff would support multiple shows.

660
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:06,550
Speaker 1: That's true.

661
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:17,390
Speaker 0: Our plan and we started this, we got some guest hosts on the show in those early days, was to have other people we trusted do other shows under the front row crew brand.

662
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,750
Speaker 0: Gig nights was just going to be one of them.

663
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:25,142
Speaker 0: We went down that road to the point that if you look at the old archive, especially like 2007, 2008, 2009, there's a bunch of episodes that are not hosted by us.

664
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:33,590
Speaker 0: Just on the feed, like two other people host gig nights using our format.

665
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:38,566
Speaker 0: And we just fucking gave up on that around 2012, I want to say.

666
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:46,150
Speaker 1: Well, I think, you know, it's well, it's because we for gig nights, we instituted the Penny Arcade rule.

667
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,670
Speaker 1: You know, we goes in at that time, right.

668
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,950
Speaker 1: We looked at Penny Arcade, right.

669
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:57,490
Speaker 1: As sort of like the model for two white dudes creating a media on their own independently on the Internet and becoming successful at it.

670
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:00,654
Speaker 1: And there's the strategy that they had.

671
00:41:00,694 --> 00:41:11,830
Speaker 1: that we latched onto was and also we looked, I guess we were looking at the South Park guys, even though they're probably even worse role models of it's just like they had a schedule.

672
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:12,571
Speaker 1: Right.

673
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:14,629
Speaker 1: Penny Arcade schedule was Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

674
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,231
Speaker 1: Right.

675
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:18,410
Speaker 1: South Park schedule was X times a year for their season.

676
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,509
Speaker 1: They just did it.

677
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,469
Speaker 0: No matter what.

678
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:21,729
Speaker 1: No matter what.

679
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,210
Speaker 1: They put something out, you know, even if it was at the last second or crappy.

680
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:25,423
Speaker 1: Right.

681
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,322
Speaker 1: So you said, OK, here's our gig night schedule.

682
00:41:27,342 --> 00:41:28,409
Speaker 1: We're going to stick to it.

683
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:32,630
Speaker 1: But other people did not have that sort of thing.

684
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:33,154
Speaker 1: Right.

685
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:34,750
Speaker 1: Where it's like they were like, here's our schedule.

686
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:37,450
Speaker 1: We're going to, you know, churn out episodes like a machine.

687
00:41:38,611 --> 00:41:45,530
Speaker 1: And so, yeah, you couldn't really be added to the network if you weren't also going to be a machine of producing content.

688
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,930
Speaker 1: And if you were, why would you want to join us?

689
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,749
Speaker 1: You could just do it yourself.

690
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:49,211
Speaker 1: Yeah.

691
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:55,070
Speaker 0: We got to this point to where we had the infrastructure, but no one was willing to put in that level of effort.

692
00:41:55,451 --> 00:42:01,390
Speaker 0: That we knew and everyone is willing to put that level of effort in with everything that we would endorse.

693
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,133
Speaker 0: Exactly.

694
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:04,889
Speaker 0: Lots of people would put in the effort that we would not endorse.

695
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:05,954
Speaker 0: Sure.

696
00:42:05,995 --> 00:42:07,148
Speaker 0: I'm sure they're out there.

697
00:42:08,173 --> 00:42:08,274
Speaker 1: Yeah.

698
00:42:08,354 --> 00:42:09,808
Speaker 1: And also, what do we have to offer them?

699
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:10,392
Speaker 1: Right.

700
00:42:10,412 --> 00:42:14,610
Speaker 1: It's like we you know, it's like if you're big, then, you know, you can offer people your platform.

701
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,715
Speaker 0: But there was a brief time like.

702
00:42:16,755 --> 00:42:27,550
Speaker 0: it's interesting because there's this confluence of like especially around 2008, 2009, when there was like this podcasting bubble that then just burst and then like that's come and gone over time.

703
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:34,590
Speaker 0: But there was this weird moment when relative to all the English podcasts in the world, we were not like huge or popular.

704
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,229
Speaker 0: Do not read into this at all.

705
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:45,030
Speaker 0: But as a percentage of the total podcasting audience, we were a lot bigger than we are now because the platforms and podcasting are so much bigger.

706
00:42:45,812 --> 00:42:45,953
Speaker 1: Yeah.

707
00:42:45,973 --> 00:42:51,030
Speaker 1: I think that our pie slice size is sort of shrunk slightly over time.

708
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:58,610
Speaker 1: But the size of the pie is so big now compared to then that our percentage of the pie is way, way, way smaller.

709
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,350
Speaker 0: But at that time, we were like I like because I did a lot of the previous stuff.

710
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:05,110
Speaker 0: We were approached by some radio stations to do consulting.

711
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:06,977
Speaker 0: But it was kind of a pain in the ass.

712
00:43:06,997 --> 00:43:09,850
Speaker 0: And we kind of just stopped talking to them after a few emails and a couple of meetings.

713
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,029
Speaker 1: We were on Japanese radio one time.

714
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:11,432
Speaker 0: We were.

715
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:12,377
Speaker 0: We were on Tokyo FM.

716
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:14,830
Speaker 0: We even signed the wall as guests in there.

717
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:15,973
Speaker 1: Yeah.

718
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:19,449
Speaker 0: Anyway, but we like there was this time like we were folks like that era.

719
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:26,750
Speaker 0: I started to take us toward Forman LLC, monetize and try to like make real money with this.

720
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:30,950
Speaker 0: I had an idea of could we pivot to doing this full time someday?

721
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:38,470
Speaker 0: And I kind of just gave up on that completely because I realized that this was like I was doing active effort toward this.

722
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:39,438
Speaker 0: This was a project.

723
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,648
Speaker 0: This was something I wanted to do.

724
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:48,190
Speaker 0: Every way to do it would either have compromised on what we liked about geek nights or compromised on our own ethics and morals.

725
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:52,030
Speaker 0: Or we realized we're not paying enough money to live the life we would want to live.

726
00:43:52,811 --> 00:43:54,422
Speaker 0: And it's not that we should talk.

727
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:55,430
Speaker 0: We did all that work.

728
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,569
Speaker 0: And then we just said, no, we just won't monetize like fuck it.

729
00:44:01,012 --> 00:44:07,290
Speaker 1: So the major, I guess, geek nights related thing that I have unfinished that I'm still slowly working on, like I worked on it the other day.

730
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:10,890
Speaker 1: It's not shit talk, you know, is basically updating our websites.

731
00:44:14,293 --> 00:44:18,128
Speaker 1: So what we did is we had in the early days, we used like a WordPress.

732
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:18,550
Speaker 1: Right.

733
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:26,250
Speaker 1: And then I said there were the plugins and things available at the time for WordPress did not let us do what we wanted to do.

734
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:33,390
Speaker 1: So we went through some iterations and eventually I just made a website and we got someone to make us those logos.

735
00:44:33,431 --> 00:44:34,830
Speaker 1: We got Brando K to make us logos.

736
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,230
Speaker 0: Kat Lee for website Brando K with the logos.

737
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:38,531
Speaker 1: Right.

738
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:44,229
Speaker 1: We got, you know, our friend Kat Lee to design the website that you see now.

739
00:44:45,491 --> 00:44:48,622
Speaker 0: And you might notice that website is a certain.

740
00:44:48,803 --> 00:44:49,786
Speaker 0: It's not a je ne sais quoi.

741
00:44:49,806 --> 00:44:50,790
Speaker 0: I know exactly what it is.

742
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,849
Speaker 0: It is Web 2.0 is what our website looks like.

743
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's anyway.

744
00:44:57,419 --> 00:44:59,450
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it hasn't been updated, basically.

745
00:44:59,892 --> 00:45:00,614
Speaker 1: You know, it works.

746
00:45:00,715 --> 00:45:04,650
Speaker 1: The software that runs it is super out of date and, you know, whatever.

747
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:08,580
Speaker 1: But I guess the job done, the code isn't broken.

748
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,430
Speaker 1: I have to occasionally, you know, fix a thing here or there.

749
00:45:11,933 --> 00:45:12,459
Speaker 1: But it's pretty.

750
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,590
Speaker 1: it's pretty rare, actually.

751
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:17,169
Speaker 0: And about half the time there's a problem is because I fucked something up, not because the website broke.

752
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,770
Speaker 0: I uploaded away because he's stupid.

753
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it should be able to resist your fuck.

754
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,417
Speaker 0: Well, you did fix that.

755
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,870
Speaker 0: It can't upload away file anymore.

756
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:27,073
Speaker 1: That's true.

757
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:30,030
Speaker 1: At least not something that ends in WAV.

758
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:32,449
Speaker 1: You could rename your MP3 to WAV.

759
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:34,246
Speaker 0: If I name my MP3 WAV, there is a much deeper problem.

760
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,467
Speaker 1: You know, you rename your WAV to dot MP3 and then upload it.

761
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:37,850
Speaker 1: It would work.

762
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:38,292
Speaker 1: Yeah.

763
00:45:38,332 --> 00:45:41,410
Speaker 0: But then there's a much more fundamental problem that we need to address.

764
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:48,910
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the thing is for the new website, what I've had to do is we already got a new graphic design.

765
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:49,854
Speaker 1: I went through with that.

766
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:50,216
Speaker 1: Right.

767
00:45:50,256 --> 00:45:51,904
Speaker 1: So we've got new business cards.

768
00:45:51,924 --> 00:45:53,210
Speaker 1: We've got new logos.

769
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:57,545
Speaker 1: I updated all our graphic design and all our other platforms.

770
00:45:57,786 --> 00:45:57,947
Speaker 1: Right.

771
00:45:58,007 --> 00:45:58,930
Speaker 1: Except for our website.

772
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,199
Speaker 1: But to update the actual website.

773
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:02,681
Speaker 1: Right.

774
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:04,690
Speaker 1: First, I got to update all the backend bits.

775
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:09,783
Speaker 1: So I could just sort of do it, you know, the sort of "meh" way.

776
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:10,625
Speaker 1: Just sort of do it.

777
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:11,127
Speaker 1: Right.

778
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:12,270
Speaker 1: Like I did it the first time.

779
00:46:12,891 --> 00:46:17,530
Speaker 1: But the problem is I'm trying to build up something that's going to like carry us even further.

780
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,380
Speaker 1: This one's already lasted like how long?

781
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,023
Speaker 1: Right.

782
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,089
Speaker 1: Some ridiculous number of years.

783
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:21,994
Speaker 0: It has to last this long.

784
00:46:22,014 --> 00:46:22,858
Speaker 0: It's like building a computer.

785
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:25,390
Speaker 0: I build a computer every eight years and just hold on to it.

786
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:29,061
Speaker 1: So I'm like fully setting up everything so perfectly.

787
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:29,302
Speaker 1: Right.

788
00:46:29,322 --> 00:46:31,530
Speaker 1: With automated deployments and all this stuff.

789
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:39,330
Speaker 1: Because if I can set that up, then if that is all working, then it's sort of once I get past like this one.

790
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:41,816
Speaker 1: It's like it's so slow, this beginning part.

791
00:46:42,658 --> 00:46:47,410
Speaker 1: Once all of that foundation is laid, then it will take off like a rocket ship.

792
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,996
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, well, I can just edit code.

793
00:46:49,317 --> 00:46:52,650
Speaker 1: And as soon as I push, it automatically deploys and updates the website instantly.

794
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:59,009
Speaker 1: And it's like if I have that set up to be so perfect with the CI/CD that we've talked about on Geek Nights before.

795
00:46:59,029 --> 00:46:59,129
Speaker 1: Right.

796
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:05,988
Speaker 1: And if I have all those things, then I'll be able to like, you know, develop the website itself crazy fast.

797
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:06,530
Speaker 1: Right.

798
00:47:06,851 --> 00:47:11,170
Speaker 1: And make changes to it, you know, without even, you know, right now to make changes to the website.

799
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:16,168
Speaker 1: I got like SSH in and mess around and deal with bullshit because it's so old and cranky.

800
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:16,288
Speaker 1: Right.

801
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:20,159
Speaker 1: I'll be able to just, you know, oh, we want to change something on the website.

802
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:20,862
Speaker 1: One, two, three.

803
00:47:20,962 --> 00:47:21,383
Speaker 1: Edit code.

804
00:47:21,624 --> 00:47:22,166
Speaker 1: Push one button.

805
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:22,648
Speaker 1: It's changed.

806
00:47:22,688 --> 00:47:22,909
Speaker 1: Done.

807
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:23,210
Speaker 1: Right.

808
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,494
Speaker 1: It'll be so great.

809
00:47:25,398 --> 00:47:28,270
Speaker 1: But we're still slowly getting towards that point.

810
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:35,110
Speaker 1: And then again, I just want to say, if anyone knows anyone who has the skills of website designing.

811
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:35,491
Speaker 1: Right.

812
00:47:35,511 --> 00:47:47,710
Speaker 1: We already have graphic design, you know, logos, aesthetic, but we need website design specifically and also HTML, JavaScript skills to turn that design into a reality.

813
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:49,512
Speaker 1: We have money.

814
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:58,770
Speaker 1: And once I get past that hurdle, we're going to need someone to do that because otherwise the website will just be black text on a white background because I don't have those skills.

815
00:47:59,692 --> 00:48:02,610
Speaker 0: You do not want to see what we're going to put together in CSS by ourselves.

816
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:07,750
Speaker 1: I mean, I could do it if we want to go for a different aesthetic, like, you know, GeoCities aesthetic.

817
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:09,209
Speaker 0: Hypnospace.

818
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:10,531
Speaker 1: Yeah.

819
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:11,433
Speaker 1: Hypnospace aesthetic.

820
00:48:11,493 --> 00:48:13,438
Speaker 1: I could just do it myself, but we don't want that.

821
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:13,758
Speaker 1: Right.

822
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:18,450
Speaker 1: So hit us up if you want money or know someone who wants money who can deliver.

823
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:20,934
Speaker 1: Professional level, though.

824
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:23,345
Speaker 1: We're not looking for, you know, live journal level.

825
00:48:23,385 --> 00:48:24,570
Speaker 1: We're looking for like pro tier.

826
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,129
Speaker 0: So this came up the other day because we're going to pay pro money.

827
00:48:27,531 --> 00:48:32,521
Speaker 0: We were I was looking at in an unrelated conversation, I was looking at like, what are people watching?

828
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34,585
Speaker 0: because my YouTube channel actually get like.

829
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:37,130
Speaker 0: there is a lot of views on my YouTube channel.

830
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,732
Speaker 0: Like there's a constant churn.

831
00:48:39,353 --> 00:48:53,210
Speaker 0: But weirdly, most of the views on any given day, unless except during like convention season where we make new panels and upload them, like only a few hundred people really watch these live streams either at the time we do it or like after the fact.

832
00:48:53,490 --> 00:49:05,630
Speaker 0: Most people are really on our channel for like the video essays and the panels, but the videos that consistently get the most views now are those utenna videos, also the most comments.

833
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:08,858
Speaker 0: And as you notice, like people keep bugging us about it.

834
00:49:08,898 --> 00:49:09,580
Speaker 0: We haven't made more.

835
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,449
Speaker 0: We've talked about in the past why we haven't made a lot more.

836
00:49:14,011 --> 00:49:22,690
Speaker 0: But the reason I bring it up in the unfinished business is that I actually have like about a third completed a new episode of that.

837
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:32,210
Speaker 0: The only reason we have not continued and actually made the videos is that it's only fun to make them when Scott and I sit on the couch and record it together.

838
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:40,648
Speaker 0: Making panel content or really any video content that involves both of us remotely kind of sucks as to do like.

839
00:49:40,668 --> 00:49:41,490
Speaker 0: it's not as fun.

840
00:49:41,991 --> 00:49:54,430
Speaker 0: This is fun doing the live stream because this is like the only time I talked to Scott, like I miss this, but doing like a panel, it's just imagine everything we do to do a panel at a con, but way less fun and way harder.

841
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:59,275
Speaker 0: Like I got to tear my living room apart and set up all these fucking lights.

842
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:09,650
Speaker 0: And the only reason we have not uploaded a new video is that I don't want to do it unless Scott and I can sit on a couch together to record that main bit.

843
00:50:12,192 --> 00:50:15,840
Speaker 0: And that sucks, but like that is literally the only reason we have not uploaded one.

844
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,045
Speaker 0: I've done 100% of the pre-production for the next episode.

845
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:29,484
Speaker 0: Along those lines, the thing I didn't even shit talk about, but I hinted at, remember way back I made that Five Nights at Freddy's video?

846
00:50:29,804 --> 00:50:32,670
Speaker 0: It's like scarily popular, but it's the only video essay I've ever uploaded.

847
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:37,157
Speaker 0: I've like half written five or six more of those.

848
00:50:37,257 --> 00:50:38,639
Speaker 0: Like they're like, I wrote a script.

849
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,165
Speaker 0: I have a teleprompter time script, like partially complete.

850
00:50:42,526 --> 00:50:43,347
Speaker 0: I have slides.

851
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:44,750
Speaker 0: I have like everything I need to do them.

852
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,412
Speaker 0: I just haven't done them.

853
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:57,430
Speaker 0: And again, it's just because during COVID, I don't like to have to tear apart my living room and set up a video studio and I'm maybe I'm just too prideful and I'm unwilling to do it shittily, like just sit down at the computer and do it like this.

854
00:50:58,332 --> 00:50:58,512
Speaker 1: Yeah.

855
00:50:58,532 --> 00:51:02,443
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, you look at someone like Sausage Guy, he's just slapping together YouTube videos.

856
00:51:02,463 --> 00:51:04,408
Speaker 1: He's already got a YouTube thing on his wall.

857
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,030
Speaker 1: We don't have that.

858
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,090
Speaker 0: That's why I bring that up as like a personal struggle.

859
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:12,981
Speaker 1: He's making like one minute videos, just slapping down a sausage with probably his phone camera, who knows what.

860
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:17,970
Speaker 1: It's like we're sitting here, like, you know, trying to make everything, you know, so, so perfect.

861
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:18,452
Speaker 1: Yep.

862
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:21,790
Speaker 0: And that's something we've struggled with for our entire lives, I think.

863
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:27,768
Speaker 1: And yeah, it's like I hold this like a certain standard I have of production quality.

864
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:28,250
Speaker 1: Right.

865
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:29,211
Speaker 0: Yep.

866
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:33,320
Speaker 1: And it's like in other areas, I've been able to overcome that.

867
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:33,540
Speaker 1: Right.

868
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:38,470
Speaker 1: So, for example, recently, you know, I got the the bike to nowhere trainer thing.

869
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:38,731
Speaker 1: Right.

870
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:42,681
Speaker 1: I guess mid mid last year and I used it a bunch.

871
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:44,345
Speaker 1: Then I didn't use it a bunch.

872
00:51:44,425 --> 00:51:45,929
Speaker 1: Then I've used it off and on.

873
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:46,190
Speaker 1: Right.

874
00:51:46,952 --> 00:51:49,577
Speaker 1: The past few weeks, I've been using it a bunch again.

875
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:55,189
Speaker 1: And, you know, I kept like at first I was just riding.

876
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:55,610
Speaker 1: Right.

877
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:57,753
Speaker 1: And streaming it on Twitch.

878
00:51:58,234 --> 00:52:03,506
Speaker 1: Then I sort of was doing the in the in game training programs.

879
00:52:03,766 --> 00:52:04,047
Speaker 1: Right.

880
00:52:04,408 --> 00:52:05,490
Speaker 1: And streaming that also.

881
00:52:06,391 --> 00:52:10,950
Speaker 1: But then when that ended, it's like there wasn't another in game streaming program that looked good.

882
00:52:11,371 --> 00:52:19,410
Speaker 1: And I started watching those videos from that Dylan guy who was my thing of the day and learning about how to make your own bike training program and all this stuff.

883
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:20,311
Speaker 1: Right.

884
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:30,730
Speaker 1: And even though that made me want to do it more, it ended up making me do it less because now I was like, well, I can't ride until I get this training program just right and figure this shit out.

885
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:33,371
Speaker 0: Yep.

886
00:52:34,012 --> 00:52:37,200
Speaker 0: So I'm kind of thinking I'm going to shit my talk myself a little.

887
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:41,870
Speaker 0: I think what I'm going to do to break this like hurdle is I'm going to you know what else you talk.

888
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:43,774
Speaker 0: I'm going to bring back the rims rants.

889
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:49,250
Speaker 0: I used to do that Friday nights, but I'm going to force myself to do it every week, no matter what.

890
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:52,445
Speaker 0: And if I'm unwilling to set up the real camera and make it look good.

891
00:52:52,847 --> 00:52:53,470
Speaker 0: Well, fuck you.

892
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,178
Speaker 0: You got to use the shitty webcam like.

893
00:52:55,218 --> 00:52:55,881
Speaker 0: that's the problem.

894
00:52:55,902 --> 00:52:57,550
Speaker 1: Just do just do just do it.

895
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:00,450
Speaker 1: You can force yourself to make a shitty one to be like it's phone camera.

896
00:53:00,671 --> 00:53:00,992
Speaker 1: Yep.

897
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:01,334
Speaker 1: That's it.

898
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:01,957
Speaker 1: Exactly.

899
00:53:01,997 --> 00:53:04,850
Speaker 0: Like I'll just I'll just stand in the shower just like all this thing.

900
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:08,189
Speaker 1: My phone camera is actually my phone camera is actually way good now because I got a new iPhone.

901
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,338
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm going to force myself to do that every other week.

902
00:53:11,378 --> 00:53:14,750
Speaker 0: The Friday episode of Geek Night starting next Friday.

903
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:22,790
Speaker 1: So what I ended up doing that's been getting me to bike, you know, more again is a I'm doing it in the morning before work because like doing it after work.

904
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,138
Speaker 1: It's like it sort of eats time out of my day.

905
00:53:25,198 --> 00:53:27,345
Speaker 1: If I do it before work, it's like I didn't lose time.

906
00:53:27,385 --> 00:53:28,489
Speaker 1: What was I doing with that time?

907
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:28,810
Speaker 1: Nothing.

908
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,251
Speaker 1: Right.

909
00:53:30,132 --> 00:53:38,710
Speaker 1: And the other thing is that now I'm basically I basically just lowered the bar instead of you know, I had this like training program set up like do X watts for X minutes.

910
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,860
Speaker 1: Now all I do and I and for like X amount of time.

911
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,121
Speaker 1: Right.

912
00:53:43,161 --> 00:53:44,204
Speaker 1: It's like a spike for an hour.

913
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:45,569
Speaker 1: I basically said, you know what?

914
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:45,910
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

915
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:50,282
Speaker 1: I'm just going to turn on this thing and pick random route.

916
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,430
Speaker 1: I don't care where where I ride or if it's a hill or not or whatever.

917
00:53:54,511 --> 00:54:00,189
Speaker 1: And I'm just going to bike for 30 minutes only and just by lowering it and not caring so much.

918
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:06,929
Speaker 1: I'm doing it more, which is way better than if I hold myself to some high bar and then don't do it at all.

919
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:07,411
Speaker 1: Yup.

920
00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:08,052
Speaker 1: Right.

921
00:54:08,753 --> 00:54:09,916
Speaker 1: It's vastly superior.

922
00:54:09,936 --> 00:54:10,697
Speaker 1: Just do this.

923
00:54:11,218 --> 00:54:11,519
Speaker 1: Right.

924
00:54:12,701 --> 00:54:13,202
Speaker 1: And it works.

925
00:54:13,262 --> 00:54:16,629
Speaker 1: It's like I feel, you know, healthier, I guess.

926
00:54:16,669 --> 00:54:16,990
Speaker 1: I don't know.

927
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,013
Speaker 0: So remember way back.

928
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:21,036
Speaker 0: We can wrap up after a couple more because the Rangers game started.

929
00:54:21,197 --> 00:54:28,830
Speaker 0: But way back we had this idea that we weirdly put way more effort into than I expected us to.

930
00:54:29,571 --> 00:54:31,253
Speaker 0: That whole president of the Internet thing.

931
00:54:31,273 --> 00:54:33,496
Speaker 0: Remember that?

932
00:54:33,977 --> 00:54:36,159
Speaker 0: I found what I think.

933
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,982
Speaker 0: I found the metadata.

934
00:54:38,002 --> 00:54:43,389
Speaker 0: Like I have a database of where I've stored data that I have in complete cold storage.

935
00:54:43,429 --> 00:54:44,250
Speaker 0: Like it's not accessible.

936
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:45,713
Speaker 0: I think I have.

937
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:47,520
Speaker 1: I think a lot of that was stopped by.

938
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,049
Speaker 1: what happened in the real world made that no longer a good idea.

939
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:53,315
Speaker 0: That's exactly what I was going to bring up with the idea.

940
00:54:53,576 --> 00:54:55,719
Speaker 0: We had an idea because we've gone on for a while.

941
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:56,621
Speaker 0: Get in all the details.

942
00:54:56,661 --> 00:55:02,070
Speaker 0: We had this idea and we wanted to make like a video series and do a thing with this idea.

943
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:05,114
Speaker 0: But the real world happened in such a way.

944
00:55:05,695 --> 00:55:07,538
Speaker 0: Not that like, oh, that idea is bad.

945
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:15,750
Speaker 0: It's that in the real world, if other if that actually happens, it looks way like it is not a good thing for society.

946
00:55:16,752 --> 00:55:16,992
Speaker 1: No.

947
00:55:17,392 --> 00:55:19,235
Speaker 0: Like it is a bad thing.

948
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:20,377
Speaker 0: that is dangerous.

949
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:27,127
Speaker 0: Sometimes the reason you don't finish something is not that like you weren't trying hard.

950
00:55:27,268 --> 00:55:28,790
Speaker 0: It's that the world changed.

951
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:38,062
Speaker 0: Like say you get really, really, really good at, I don't know, making funny animations and uploading them to your website, like a collegehuber.com.

952
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:43,770
Speaker 0: Say you make a fun little website and then the world changes and you can't monetize that anymore.

953
00:55:44,271 --> 00:55:45,053
Speaker 0: And you're just gone.

954
00:55:45,534 --> 00:55:49,322
Speaker 0: There's nothing you could have done to prevent that if the world just changes around you.

955
00:55:49,723 --> 00:55:52,930
Speaker 0: because like what you were doing does not apply to a later world.

956
00:55:55,332 --> 00:56:02,530
Speaker 0: I was just thinking about that with that whole president of the internet because what a good idea that was a bad idea that ever was.

957
00:56:03,654 --> 00:56:04,409
Speaker 1: Very bad idea.

958
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:10,799
Speaker 0: I also have a sort of a success story in that I was very into music.

959
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:17,470
Speaker 0: Like I would like compose stuff and play my trumpet and everything and I kind of stopped doing it for like more than a decade.

960
00:56:19,611 --> 00:56:23,019
Speaker 0: But I always told myself I'd start it up again and then stop it.

961
00:56:23,059 --> 00:56:23,961
Speaker 0: Start it up again and stop it.

962
00:56:24,002 --> 00:56:25,445
Speaker 0: Like oh I should start composing again.

963
00:56:25,786 --> 00:56:27,530
Speaker 0: Start learning some software then I don't do it.

964
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:48,390
Speaker 0: I did force myself during COVID to actually just start practicing my trumpet again and the way I was able to do it was I stopped having a goal of to be able to do X. Like it was no longer get good enough at my trumpet to like go do a gig thing or to make a video or start composing music again to upload something to Geek Nights.

965
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,472
Speaker 0: Like hey I made a song.

966
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:56,150
Speaker 0: I literally just started doing it to do it and enjoy it intrinsically with no goal at all.

967
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:01,370
Speaker 0: And I've been playing my trumpet consistently since March and I'm actually getting close to as good as I used to be again.

968
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:05,666
Speaker 0: And it feels real good and you're never going to see videos of it because I'm not doing it for you.

969
00:57:05,706 --> 00:57:06,549
Speaker 0: I'm doing it only for me.

970
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:10,191
Speaker 1: Mmm.

971
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:14,509
Speaker 1: I think the only other thing I could think of right that is...

972
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:19,550
Speaker 0: Oh I have like 50 things on this list of projects that have stalled out in my life that I really care about.

973
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:20,901
Speaker 1: That's a lot.

974
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:21,228
Speaker 1: Oh no.

975
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:26,730
Speaker 0: One of them involves a brand that I'm just not going to bring up because I don't want to even invoke the drama of that brand.

976
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:33,610
Speaker 0: But that's the thing that we have paused waiting for things to cool down and see if it's a thing we want to do or not.

977
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:36,316
Speaker 1: Oh okay.

978
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:43,425
Speaker 1: But yeah the only other one that I can think of is there was a... You know I do a lot of photography action right?

979
00:57:43,445 --> 00:57:44,170
Speaker 1: I got all these cameras.

980
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,970
Speaker 0: I'm looking up at my GX1 and the zoom lens that are sitting right there.

981
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,677
Speaker 1: I got a whole pile of cameras up there right?

982
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,267
Speaker 1: And I never planned to do it professionally.

983
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:56,370
Speaker 1: I have no interest in that right?

984
00:57:56,812 --> 00:57:58,462
Speaker 1: It's not a fun job or anything.

985
00:57:58,502 --> 00:57:59,267
Speaker 1: I just like doing it.

986
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:07,450
Speaker 1: But the thing is when you're a photographer it's like you try to find like what is your style, what's your angle, what's your thing right?

987
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,490
Speaker 1: You know you could be maybe someone who shoots owls or something.

988
00:58:12,193 --> 00:58:12,897
Speaker 1: There are people who do that.

989
00:58:12,938 --> 00:58:13,924
Speaker 1: All they do is photograph owls.

990
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:14,870
Speaker 1: Like they're the owl photographer.

991
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:15,452
Speaker 1: There's a guy.

992
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:16,718
Speaker 1: He's the squirrel photographer.

993
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:18,667
Speaker 1: All he does is photograph squirrels right?

994
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:19,250
Speaker 1: That's his thing.

995
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,512
Speaker 0: You know what?

996
00:58:20,573 --> 00:58:23,470
Speaker 0: Now I'm just having flashbacks to when we went to Australia and you kept making fun of me.

997
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:30,050
Speaker 0: Because I kept documenting every time I found a utility door that was labeled with what's in there in Melbourne.

998
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:36,165
Speaker 1: But anyway so I was trying to like well what's my thing right?

999
00:58:36,205 --> 00:58:36,867
Speaker 1: What can I do?

1000
00:58:38,951 --> 00:58:42,764
Speaker 1: So I thought about like you know what do I like to look at right?

1001
00:58:42,845 --> 00:58:44,310
Speaker 1: And that's what I should probably photograph.

1002
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:47,320
Speaker 1: So I thought you know that's my favorite things to look at.

1003
00:58:47,461 --> 00:58:49,810
Speaker 1: is you know when I'm biking around the city right?

1004
00:58:50,112 --> 00:58:53,150
Speaker 1: I like to look at people having fun you know around the city.

1005
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:57,770
Speaker 1: You know because you don't see it's the part of the city you don't see if you know you're not biking around.

1006
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,996
Speaker 1: If you're in a car or if you don't live here right?

1007
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:04,390
Speaker 1: You don't see like you know a birthday party in the park right?

1008
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,810
Speaker 0: Oh that is that is literally my favorite part of running those half marathons.

1009
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,490
Speaker 0: The one thing I can kind of do during COVID.

1010
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:14,810
Speaker 0: Because you get to Randall's Island and you'll see like a family by themselves in a field just having a little birthday party.

1011
00:59:15,812 --> 00:59:22,050
Speaker 1: One time I biked to the secret beach and there was I don't I forget what like what their culture was.

1012
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:26,370
Speaker 1: But basically they were having a celebration for a new a new baby right?

1013
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,999
Speaker 1: And it involved drinking a beverage that I had not heard of.

1014
00:59:30,661 --> 00:59:33,270
Speaker 1: that was very alcoholic obviously right?

1015
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:39,810
Speaker 1: And maybe I don't know if it was like you know Christian or Catholic or baptism in any way.

1016
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,810
Speaker 1: But they still wanted to put the baby in the water or something right?

1017
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:46,310
Speaker 1: So that's why they were at the secret beach having a good time.

1018
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:51,230
Speaker 1: And they of course had the table full of all the catering trays full of delicious food right?

1019
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:55,510
Speaker 1: So I'm just sitting there biking eating my you know ice cream whatever I was eating right?

1020
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,356
Speaker 1: And these people made friends with me.

1021
00:59:57,396 --> 01:00:00,670
Speaker 1: they're like hey you know we're celebrating the baby you want to drink our beverage?

1022
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:04,990
Speaker 1: And I'm like no sorry I would drink your beverage if it didn't have poison in it though you know.

1023
01:00:06,393 --> 01:00:08,750
Speaker 1: Hey you know having a good time talking about stuff right?

1024
01:00:10,312 --> 01:00:13,770
Speaker 1: The problem is is that a lot of those things right?

1025
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:17,270
Speaker 1: If you just go around photographing that kind of stuff right?

1026
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:20,650
Speaker 1: There's like children there right?

1027
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:24,150
Speaker 1: Or you know there's problems you know with some of those things right?

1028
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:24,792
Speaker 1: Oh let me go.

1029
01:00:24,812 --> 01:00:29,190
Speaker 1: there's a beautiful children's birthday party in the park let random strangers start photographing it.

1030
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:30,709
Speaker 1: No let's not do that right?

1031
01:00:32,111 --> 01:00:38,170
Speaker 1: But the one thing I saw in parks that I could photograph was amateur sports right?

1032
01:00:38,573 --> 01:00:40,950
Speaker 1: There's people playing all kinds of sports in the park right?

1033
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:46,570
Speaker 1: You get your cricket out in Queens you know and you see a lot of sports that like you know are not normal right?

1034
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,094
Speaker 1: You see stuff like.

1035
01:00:48,576 --> 01:00:52,130
Speaker 1: there's people who play like hockey on fixies on a basketball court in Brooklyn.

1036
01:00:52,756 --> 01:00:53,729
Speaker 0: I've seen that happen.

1037
01:00:54,651 --> 01:01:00,589
Speaker 0: There's a roller hockey rink that has some like serious like amateur play at 96th street.

1038
01:01:02,513 --> 01:01:04,990
Speaker 1: Oh that one I was talking about the one in Brooklyn Bridge Park where I went.

1039
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:09,710
Speaker 0: Oh yeah I know that one too but 96th street is where like I've stopped and actually watched them play sometimes on my runs.

1040
01:01:10,513 --> 01:01:13,150
Speaker 0: Because they're going hard when they're playing hockey.

1041
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,862
Speaker 1: I'll have to check that one out.

1042
01:01:14,902 --> 01:01:16,030
Speaker 1: you know there's tennis right?

1043
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:20,290
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of stuff and the people who are playing these sports are usually adults right?

1044
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,230
Speaker 1: You know little league games are happening in closed places right?

1045
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,421
Speaker 1: Not just in public parks where someone reserves.

1046
01:01:26,904 --> 01:01:28,030
Speaker 1: you know the park right?

1047
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:33,830
Speaker 1: So I was like hey every single time I went to talk to people hey can I photograph your game?

1048
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,020
Speaker 1: They were like please do send us the photos.

1049
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:37,306
Speaker 1: oh my god here's my content.

1050
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:38,050
Speaker 1: you know the whole thing.

1051
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:41,790
Speaker 1: I have business cards right so they could find the photos after I upload them.

1052
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:42,855
Speaker 1: I set up the whole thing.

1053
01:01:43,176 --> 01:01:45,830
Speaker 1: I did it several times for like a few years.

1054
01:01:45,971 --> 01:01:46,957
Speaker 1: I would go on the weekend.

1055
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:49,190
Speaker 1: I'd bike around until I found a sport.

1056
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:51,138
Speaker 1: I would photograph the hell out of it.

1057
01:01:51,319 --> 01:01:53,910
Speaker 1: I would you know curate, edit, upload.

1058
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:55,220
Speaker 1: There's a website full of them.

1059
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,330
Speaker 1: I had an Instagram account.

1060
01:01:56,772 --> 01:01:57,398
Speaker 1: I still have it.

1061
01:01:57,761 --> 01:01:58,850
Speaker 1: I didn't used to have it right?

1062
01:01:59,573 --> 01:02:03,810
Speaker 1: The Facebook page is gone because Facebook turns off your Facebook page if you don't update it enough.

1063
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:06,730
Speaker 1: But I was just trying to be on every platform right?

1064
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,555
Speaker 1: And I did that a whole bunch.

1065
01:02:09,615 --> 01:02:10,478
Speaker 1: It wasn't a shit talk.

1066
01:02:10,539 --> 01:02:12,044
Speaker 1: I did it like many many times.

1067
01:02:12,787 --> 01:02:13,529
Speaker 1: you know quite a few.

1068
01:02:14,591 --> 01:02:19,370
Speaker 1: But then I just stopped doing it because I wasn't you know biking to see sports.

1069
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:24,370
Speaker 1: And you know I didn't have the time or I was you know ended up doing other things.

1070
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:27,082
Speaker 1: Even though it would still I would still like.

1071
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:28,650
Speaker 1: it was like a whole summer went by.

1072
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:31,003
Speaker 1: Where like every like Saturday I'd wake up.

1073
01:02:31,325 --> 01:02:32,210
Speaker 1: I'd be like let's go biking.

1074
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:36,710
Speaker 1: And instead and I'd be like oh I should go I should go do sports photos right?

1075
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:40,670
Speaker 1: But instead of doing that I would just bike really far upstate instead.

1076
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:46,170
Speaker 1: And obviously if you do that you're not seeing any city sports when you do that right?

1077
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:49,509
Speaker 1: I'm leaving the city taking the train home or something like that.

1078
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:52,750
Speaker 1: So I just haven't done it in so long.

1079
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,016
Speaker 1: But I basically wanted to just.

1080
01:02:54,136 --> 01:02:56,770
Speaker 1: my idea was just keep doing it until at least someone notices.

1081
01:02:58,532 --> 01:03:02,030
Speaker 1: Even if I was even if I was doing a shitty job I don't think I was doing that great.

1082
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:04,098
Speaker 1: But you know people thought I was doing great.

1083
01:03:04,158 --> 01:03:06,990
Speaker 1: At least the people who were in the photos occasionally thought it was great.

1084
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:09,016
Speaker 1: So you know.

1085
01:03:09,056 --> 01:03:12,830
Speaker 1: and then it's like now you got a pandemic that stopped the whole thing right?

1086
01:03:13,392 --> 01:03:14,990
Speaker 1: Even harder than it was already stopped.

1087
01:03:16,512 --> 01:03:17,649
Speaker 0: That's something to bear in mind too.

1088
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:19,215
Speaker 0: Part of it like.

1089
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:22,850
Speaker 0: I think you need to internalize this message if you're feeling doubt about not creating stuff.

1090
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:24,104
Speaker 1: But let's not fool ourselves.

1091
01:03:24,164 --> 01:03:24,589
Speaker 1: I stopped.

1092
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:29,870
Speaker 1: The last one I did was several years ago not you know March 2020.

1093
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:34,410
Speaker 0: But for everything you think like oh I have this unfinished business this thing that I just got to get going again.

1094
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:38,630
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons why you might have gotten that thing going again recently.

1095
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:40,730
Speaker 0: And that's pretty normal.

1096
01:03:41,991 --> 01:03:47,230
Speaker 0: Like for everything you see us do there's like 10 things that we just gave up on or failed at.

1097
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:51,630
Speaker 0: Or are still like trying to get going but can't quite get it off the ground.

1098
01:03:52,152 --> 01:03:55,709
Speaker 0: Don't think that just because we do geek nights constantly that we succeed at everything we do.

1099
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:57,512
Speaker 1: Yeah I definitely.

1100
01:03:57,593 --> 01:04:02,950
Speaker 1: if I could retire for real I could do that like twice a week and still have plenty of time right?

1101
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:03,433
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

1102
01:04:03,474 --> 01:04:05,330
Speaker 0: if I could retire for real I would do geek nights.

1103
01:04:05,932 --> 01:04:09,530
Speaker 0: I would make content creation and a bunch of stuff like this my full-time job.

1104
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:10,334
Speaker 0: But I can't.

1105
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:11,729
Speaker 0: I gotta pay bills.

1106
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:12,873
Speaker 1: Right and like.

1107
01:04:12,893 --> 01:04:16,850
Speaker 1: this wasn't shit like for example right that time that I went out to that roller hockey rink.

1108
01:04:17,071 --> 01:04:18,374
Speaker 1: It's like I buy.

1109
01:04:18,414 --> 01:04:20,500
Speaker 1: I was biking around without cameras.

1110
01:04:20,601 --> 01:04:22,386
Speaker 1: I saw the roller hockey rink.

1111
01:04:22,446 --> 01:04:23,770
Speaker 1: I talked to the people there.

1112
01:04:24,191 --> 01:04:25,655
Speaker 1: I asked them when they were playing.

1113
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:30,510
Speaker 1: they said they were playing they that like the league is there on like Wednesday nights or something like that.

1114
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,923
Speaker 1: And I went over like I was going there after work.

1115
01:04:32,984 --> 01:04:33,949
Speaker 1: I brought everything to work.

1116
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:37,968
Speaker 1: I went there after like it was a job after work or you know I was really doing it.

1117
01:04:39,031 --> 01:04:43,749
Speaker 1: Not not even close to shit talk but I just haven't done it in a long ass time.

1118
01:04:45,152 --> 01:04:46,550
Speaker 1: Alright so unfinished business.

1119
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:50,549
Speaker 0: And I think that's enough because I haven't even checked the score of the Rangers game.

1120
01:04:50,629 --> 01:04:50,730
Speaker 0: so.

1121
01:04:51,571 --> 01:04:54,750
Speaker 1: It's 0-0 but stupid Lou Mew is in the box again of course.

1122
01:04:55,511 --> 01:04:59,530
Speaker 0: Of course when Tony Deal will be in there next it will be a 5 on 3.

1123
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:00,578
Speaker 1: Looks like they're killing it off.

1124
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:02,050
Speaker 1: alright we'll see.

1125
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:07,586
Speaker 0: So yeah don't fault yourself for having unfinished business.

1126
01:05:07,726 --> 01:05:08,910
Speaker 0: everyone has unfinished business.

1127
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,798
Speaker 0: Don't force yourself to finish business.

1128
01:05:10,818 --> 01:05:13,109
Speaker 0: that's not satisfying unless you have a good reason to.

1129
01:05:14,271 --> 01:05:18,070
Speaker 1: Avoid shit talk avoid bowling ball but don't feel bad about an unfinished business.

1130
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:23,750
Speaker 0: Yeah because if you started something and put effort into it that is more than like most people are ever able to do about anything.

1131
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:25,489
Speaker 0: Like that is a good step.

1132
01:05:31,271 --> 01:05:33,390
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1146
01:06:28,971 --> 01:06:32,470
Speaker 0: Yeah looks like the NWHL game for everything we talked about.

1147
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:34,508
Speaker 0: The dark bad luck cloud hanging over it.

1148
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,950
Speaker 0: Looks like now the game was cancelled because of additional COVID issues.

1149
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:41,710
Speaker 0: So yeah, we'll see how long any sports continue in the US.

1150
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:46,659
Speaker 0: But for now, I leave you with... Oh boy!

1151
01:06:47,186 --> 01:06:47,328
Speaker 0: Seven!

1152
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:50,430
Speaker 0: Say, did you ever kill a giant?

1153
01:06:53,526 --> 01:06:53,837
Speaker 1: Seven!

1154
01:06:58,521 --> 01:07:00,559
Speaker 1: I killed seven giants with one blow!

1155
01:07:01,502 --> 01:07:02,559
Speaker 1: Seven with one blow!

1156
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:03,498
Speaker 1: How many?

1157
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:03,993
Speaker 1: Six!

1158
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:04,600
Speaker 1: Seven!

1159
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:05,476
Speaker 1: With one blow?

1160
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,639
Speaker 1: Jiminy Cricket!

1161
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:07,125
Speaker 0: Who?

1162
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:07,879
Speaker 0: The tailor!

1163
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:08,696
Speaker 0: Do you mean it?

1164
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:09,196
Speaker 0: Seven!

1165
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,219
Speaker 0: With one blow?

1166
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:10,579
Speaker 0: No!

1167
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:11,260
Speaker 0: Yes!

1168
01:07:12,723 --> 01:07:13,639
Speaker 0: Seven with one blow!

1169
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:15,033
Speaker 0: Seven!

1170
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:19,340
Speaker 1: Did you kill seven at one blow?

1171
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:21,420
Speaker 0: Uh, yes your honor.

1172
01:07:21,883 --> 01:07:22,298
Speaker 0: And how?
