1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,535
Speaker 0: It's Monday July 28th 2014.

2
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:15,546
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:20,104
Speaker 0: We talk about children and Technology and the future.

4
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:23,922
Speaker 0: it's all right Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:40,909
Speaker 0: So my office needed a Security camera just because someone walked into our office like during the day not that long ago went into what like we have a little conference room kind of by the front door and Like they just walked in and took someone's laptop and walked out.

6
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:42,013
Speaker 1: Awesome good.

7
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:42,575
Speaker 1: Yeah them.

8
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:47,770
Speaker 0: so we you know we dealt with that, but the CEO was like we need a security camera.

9
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:58,720
Speaker 0: And I'm started to learn over the years that in every job I've ever had whenever there's anything that isn't like in the direct purview of like everyone's specific job They call someone else to take.

10
00:00:58,781 --> 00:00:59,507
Speaker 0: no they call me.

11
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:09,570
Speaker 0: Everywhere I've worked IBM my current company my previous company that hospital anything weird everyone's like hey And they come over to me, and they're like how do we get a security camera?

12
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:17,761
Speaker 0: And if someone else is tasked directly with one of those weird jobs that person will come over to me and ask me Like what do you know about security cameras?

13
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:19,470
Speaker 0: because they assume that I know something about it.

14
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,003
Speaker 1: Is you're the only one knows how to Google exactly so.

15
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:31,939
Speaker 0: little googling later I found actually that security systems are not that expensive like big ones with like for Night-vision cameras and loaded up with SD cards.

16
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,810
Speaker 1: probably just need one camera and a recorder, and that's it yeah.

17
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:39,232
Speaker 0: So I looked at all these systems, and they were not that expensive And they'd be really.

18
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:48,950
Speaker 0: you could probably install it yourself trivially like five or six hundred bucks tops for like a really good system That'll keep like a month's worth of HD video and all that stuff and ir splash.

19
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:54,261
Speaker 0: And then I looked at him, and I realized that if I buy that I'll have to install it.

20
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,070
Speaker 0: I'll have to maintain it.

21
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,970
Speaker 0: I'll be in charge of it for as long as I work here which Called like some security company to come do it.

22
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:02,772
Speaker 0: Oh That's how.

23
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:04,759
Speaker 0: I'm the phone administrator of this company.

24
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:06,786
Speaker 1: you're doing the phones - you didn't?

25
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:07,810
Speaker 1: you don't have a contract for that.

26
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:08,434
Speaker 0: I am the phone.

27
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:09,844
Speaker 0: I am the phone person.

28
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:13,136
Speaker 0: I in fact Am a phone person now.

29
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,501
Speaker 1: Did you set it up with?

30
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:16,990
Speaker 0: I set up everything power over ethernet up?

31
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,396
Speaker 1: No, it's not VoIP phones.

32
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:18,718
Speaker 0: No.

33
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:19,824
Speaker 0: It's not just regular.

34
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:20,990
Speaker 0: I suggested VoIP phones.

35
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,903
Speaker 0: They didn't want to pay for them, but they're just better in every concern.

36
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,007
Speaker 0: I know don't get me started.

37
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,180
Speaker 0: so Then I realized you know all that.

38
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:38,788
Speaker 0: so then I just ordered a drop cam and I told the person you know like our office manager like look you can set this up here because it's like you know.

39
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:44,070
Speaker 0: drop cam It's like they didn't set it up up, so they couldn't even though babies first wasn't their fault.

40
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,086
Speaker 0: So here's my problem with drop cam because I like drop you couldn't mount it.

41
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:49,050
Speaker 0: Oh, no none of that.

42
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:50,034
Speaker 0: I well one.

43
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,670
Speaker 0: I'm the only person in this company who drills into drywall.

44
00:02:55,957 --> 00:03:01,940
Speaker 1: Okay Take a drill you aim it at the wall, and you push yeah Just I'm holding the trigger dad make sure it's plugged in.

45
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,550
Speaker 1: make sure that the screw the the drill bit is in tight.

46
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:13,439
Speaker 0: You know when I went into I feel bit key Was al Biles told me after he played his jazz trumpet and said you should join IT Toodly-toodly-toot you'll make a lot of money.

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,619
Speaker 0: Toodly-toodly-toot won't have to do a lot of work Toodly-toodly-toot, and he was a hundred percent accurate.

48
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,068
Speaker 1: and all that the guy told me the same thing.

49
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:26,096
Speaker 0: yep You chose a slightly harder job that pays slightly less But you get to do what you actually want.

50
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:29,349
Speaker 1: I could make much much more if I so decide I work for me.

51
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,629
Speaker 1: Well, I could work less than 40 hours a week.

52
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:37,730
Speaker 0: I could make that guarantee, but you'd have to do mostly like really boring Java development.

53
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:44,150
Speaker 1: Can I sit around and read reddit for most of those less than 40 hours long as you finish the tickets?

54
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,760
Speaker 0: I assigned to you and the code I give you.

55
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:49,090
Speaker 1: can I bike into work and bring them a bike in the office?

56
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:49,830
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

57
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:52,620
Speaker 1: Can I wear like shorts and a t-shirt?

58
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:54,389
Speaker 0: I've just been fucking wearing shorts to work.

59
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,088
Speaker 1: Can I have like 30 vacation days?

60
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,947
Speaker 0: no Anyway, so I get the drop cam and I have a drop cam.

61
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:09,710
Speaker 0: now like I use it That's our bunny camera or whatever and they're great like I like them.

62
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,626
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna review the drop cam on this at work.

63
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:14,634
Speaker 0: I plug it in Doesn't work.

64
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:19,291
Speaker 0: It's a broken one, and it gives you zero Information.

65
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:25,400
Speaker 0: it has an LED that can show blue or orange With or without blinking.

66
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,090
Speaker 1: This is what people want Apple products.

67
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,799
Speaker 1: You can't think you did just work.

68
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,563
Speaker 0: so I plug it.

69
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,890
Speaker 0: so I plug it in and it's simple.

70
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,449
Speaker 1: So I look no help for you.

71
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:39,578
Speaker 0: And of course the office manager like she set it up a hundred percent correctly and when she plugs it in it Blinks yellow, which means connecting.

72
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:47,169
Speaker 0: then it shows blue like connected to Wi-Fi And then she gets an email like it turned on and it shows a picture that it took right then.

73
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:56,053
Speaker 0: but then if she clicks on the video it times out and eventually the light on the camera just turns off and nothing and There's no logs.

74
00:04:56,274 --> 00:04:59,970
Speaker 0: I even like plug the device into a computer and poked around like there's no logs anywhere.

75
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,067
Speaker 0: The website just says your camera is not connected.

76
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:10,898
Speaker 0: long story short it needs a bunch of specific ports open out to the internet and That's not documented fucking anywhere.

77
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,770
Speaker 1: No, it probably just assumes you have like a UNP PNP or basic home router.

78
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:16,310
Speaker 0: Even with that like it doesn't work.

79
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:24,303
Speaker 0: It needs like 13 like the RTMP port open to the outside and port 80 And some other things and it just doesn't fucking say anything.

80
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:26,150
Speaker 0: gives no way to troubleshoot this.

81
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:29,183
Speaker 1: I'm sure it says if you google it, so I plugged it.

82
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:29,906
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

83
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:30,690
Speaker 0: that's the problem.

84
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,955
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's someone who wrote this.

85
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:40,850
Speaker 0: I found a few blogs of people but the official drop cam website Basically doesn't actually give you any as the kind of thing that would be in the drop cam forum on the support forum on their.

86
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:42,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know how I found it.

87
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:49,303
Speaker 0: someone was complaining saying that they should be able to configure the ports They should but they didn't say what ports it starts on by default.

88
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:50,588
Speaker 0: I just had to assume it.

89
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:51,089
Speaker 0: Mmm.

90
00:05:51,692 --> 00:06:02,140
Speaker 0: So knowing what I know I got it all set up and got it working and then I had some other issues where occasionally It'll just turn off and not turn back on Mmm, so I opened a support ticket with drop cam.

91
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,466
Speaker 0: They have yet to respond.

92
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:03,968
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

93
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:06,016
Speaker 0: They They're not.

94
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,770
Speaker 0: I don't think they have that many employees.

95
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,480
Speaker 0: They're still not fully integrated into nest because nest bought them and Google bought nest.

96
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:14,485
Speaker 0: so the hard.

97
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:15,207
Speaker 0: it's like GoPro.

98
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:20,344
Speaker 0: the hardware is great But at the same time the interface to that hardware is kind of.

99
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:21,771
Speaker 1: but well It's.

100
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:24,790
Speaker 1: you know, that's what happens when you try to buy simple stuff and not pro stuff.

101
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,181
Speaker 1: Yes, we're too used to pro stuff and semi pro stuff.

102
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:30,790
Speaker 0: I know I mean, I'm looking right now at the Mackie We use for like geek nights.

103
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:37,795
Speaker 0: I'm thinking back to like what if we tried to do geek nights now with the not professional equipment We had before and I would just quit.

104
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,881
Speaker 0: I was like not do geek nights anymore.

105
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:47,930
Speaker 1: All right, so in somewhat tech news Alright, the only thing I could find anything to say about Amazon opened up a new store today.

106
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:49,410
Speaker 1: It's actually just part of Amazon.

107
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:57,004
Speaker 1: I don't know what they call it like a store, but it's really just a section of the amazon.com For 3d printing and it sells 3d printing supplies.

108
00:06:57,204 --> 00:07:01,481
Speaker 1: books about 3d printing Smart move plastic that you can use.

109
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,325
Speaker 0: it's not the maker.

110
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:03,510
Speaker 0: ferret for 3d printing is big.

111
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,859
Speaker 0: I mean how many people are kick-starting.

112
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:06,390
Speaker 0: I'm making a 3d printer.

113
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:09,482
Speaker 0: That's the same as all the other 3d printers, but crooks slightly.

114
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,489
Speaker 1: so right you can actually buy 3d printers, too.

115
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,548
Speaker 1: But the one thing that they're selling that's interesting is actual things that are 3d printed now.

116
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:24,038
Speaker 1: They're not competing directly so much with shape ways where you send shape ways that your model and then you know Your digital file and then they print it and send it to you.

117
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,441
Speaker 1: What they're doing is they sort of have like these pre Done models.

118
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:45,152
Speaker 1: so for example Create your own 3d printed Mixi for 30 bucks and what you do is it's like it's almost like you make a me using this little interface in when you check out and like you can choose the hair and the color in the face and whatever and Then they print.

119
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:52,208
Speaker 1: so it's sort of like you can slightly customize this 3d printed model And then they print it out and send it to you.

120
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:53,370
Speaker 0: That's a pretty good idea.

121
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:57,290
Speaker 1: So you don't have to know any 3d modeling and you can get some personalization.

122
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:00,341
Speaker 0: Emily even had that idea like way back when ponies were things she was like.

123
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:13,530
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna do this because you know shit talking But it'd be trivial to make like a bunch of pretty generic But very high quality pony models and then let people customize the parameters that are trivially customized and print their things for them.

124
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,910
Speaker 1: I mean this you know Hasbro just went to a partnership with shape ways.

125
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:19,055
Speaker 1: Right yeah, and they're actually.

126
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:23,250
Speaker 1: you can go to the take an official pony printing site and do similar thing.

127
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,294
Speaker 1: They're like.

128
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,600
Speaker 1: it's actually an official partnership.

129
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,062
Speaker 1: I think it's good.

130
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:29,783
Speaker 1: shape way saw how many people were printing ponies Yeah, and they must have contacted Hasbro.

131
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:36,350
Speaker 0: the deal Hasbro was way the fuck behind the curve on making merchandise And we talked about that on other shows.

132
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,210
Speaker 1: But well we love fine seems to be scooping up all the money on companies that are way behind on making merchandise.

133
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, we love vines a brilliant business model.

134
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,090
Speaker 1: It's almost like just don't like any of their products.

135
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:46,034
Speaker 1: They're tacky as fuck.

136
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:46,756
Speaker 0: You know what they are.

137
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:50,210
Speaker 0: they're the square print silkscreen red dragon shirt.

138
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:51,416
Speaker 0: That's what they are.

139
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:53,446
Speaker 0: square print Twilight Sparkle.

140
00:08:53,466 --> 00:09:03,260
Speaker 0: yep But the ponies themselves at least like the model is a pretty simple model and doesn't have the kinds of things that Make it difficult to print like a lot of.

141
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,049
Speaker 0: like anime characters might have a unicorn horn.

142
00:09:05,732 --> 00:09:09,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what's hard to print tall things with thin legs.

143
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:14,690
Speaker 0: You know it's easy to print squat things with big old blob legs.

144
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:22,910
Speaker 1: You could just print the thing the tall skinny thing really big yeah, but even then it's gonna have issues sure.

145
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:29,866
Speaker 0: Anyway, I mean Unless you put like polonium in the feet you can't make a Sailor Moon crystal model.

146
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:31,170
Speaker 0: It'll stand under its own power.

147
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,242
Speaker 0: I don't think crystal.

148
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:39,996
Speaker 1: no You can make a Luna model yeah, or you can make a But a wand.

149
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:42,850
Speaker 0: so I think this story a wand in quotes.

150
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:49,600
Speaker 0: So this story does tell us one thing that we've been saying a lot 3d tech like the 3d printing stuff like people kind of poo-poo.

151
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,567
Speaker 0: it is like this really like early hobby thing.

152
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:58,070
Speaker 0: once again It is moving way faster than almost everyone thinks it is a 3d printing.

153
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,099
Speaker 1: It's like you look at oculus rift, and I'm like.

154
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:06,611
Speaker 1: I don't think in any time soon It's gonna be small convenient or cheap enough for everyone to be using that Etc.

155
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:10,990
Speaker 0: yeah like people are into it will use it nerds for it will use it same with Google Glass.

156
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,281
Speaker 1: But the 3d printing that's already a thing right.

157
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:19,977
Speaker 1: I mean originally 2d printing was a thing that you couldn't do unless you went to A printing press and 3d.

158
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:27,856
Speaker 0: I remember when I'm binkos opened up near my house Jesus Christ and like some majorly rich person might have a printer I went to that.

159
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:28,439
Speaker 0: kinkos.

160
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,356
Speaker 0: like the week it opened with Machine was a big deal.

161
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:33,059
Speaker 1: you had to go.

162
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,766
Speaker 1: It's like the library, and they had one.

163
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:35,690
Speaker 1: you put quarters in it.

164
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:42,246
Speaker 0: I remember printing copy photocopies of pages from my Dungeons & Dragons books and that was goddamn magic.

165
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:42,748
Speaker 1: right.

166
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,694
Speaker 1: and now You can just print.

167
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:47,928
Speaker 1: I can rent fucking photos which the the for like 30 cents.

168
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, drug store used to have to do and Scott was 24 hours.

169
00:10:51,390 --> 00:11:03,950
Speaker 0: I was printing ultra high-resolution glossy photos on photo paper at our booth at Connecticut with no, and I didn't even need power outlets though I used them because I can use them and you were just sending the photos to that thing wirelessly wireless.

170
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:13,030
Speaker 1: I took a photo in the camera wirelessly send it to the iPad where I Photoshopped it and then wirelessly sent it to a printer that could have been battery powered which then print.

171
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,352
Speaker 0: It's got.

172
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,883
Speaker 0: think about this when we were kids.

173
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:19,177
Speaker 0: You know what didn't exist wireless anything about CB radios.

174
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:21,443
Speaker 0: a computer powerful enough to do any of that.

175
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:24,792
Speaker 0: printing on paper printing in color Right.

176
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:26,578
Speaker 1: so 3d printing is gonna be just.

177
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:29,647
Speaker 1: you know it's gonna be just like 2d printing is.

178
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,017
Speaker 1: yeah I just think the thing is.

179
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:34,630
Speaker 1: 2d printing is something that died.

180
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:38,425
Speaker 1: No It's something that like a lot of people sort of generally needed.

181
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,557
Speaker 1: right like Everyone needed it.

182
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:42,710
Speaker 1: if you had a computer you sort of needed a printer.

183
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:44,799
Speaker 1: You know cuz like you would off with.

184
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:49,880
Speaker 1: you know especially pre-internet you would type a letter But then you couldn't internet it to anyone's.

185
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,470
Speaker 1: you had to print it and mail it or print it and hand it into the teacher.

186
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:59,229
Speaker 1: And even today, you know if you're in school or even in a business you still need to print out documents, right?

187
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:02,527
Speaker 1: I think people print way more documents than they really have to.

188
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:04,937
Speaker 0: oh my god Don't get me started by about any developer.

189
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,349
Speaker 1: probably like one in 50 documents actually needs to be printed.

190
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:14,570
Speaker 1: that's a conservative estimate, but There are occasions where you still need to print out documents.

191
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:22,435
Speaker 0: Yeah Anytime developers asked me a question about a spec and I walk over and they show me the section they have a question on because They print it out like the whole confluence page.

192
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:23,618
Speaker 0: I'm like guy.

193
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,408
Speaker 0: I've updated that page like 40 times in the last month.

194
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:33,590
Speaker 1: Yep Yep But yeah 3d printing is not every something everyone will need to have in their home.

195
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,948
Speaker 1: But you know cuz like a lot of people might just never need to print a 3d thing.

196
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,632
Speaker 0: Of course.

197
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:42,484
Speaker 0: at the same time I could argue that the same thing was said of printing on paper for a time.

198
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,242
Speaker 1: Mmm, I mean like what would my parents ever need to print in 3d?

199
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,970
Speaker 0: So imagine well, let's skip the far future.

200
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,323
Speaker 0: We're duh, like you're printing like everything right when you're printing food.

201
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:53,664
Speaker 1: Sure.

202
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:54,266
Speaker 1: We're skipping that.

203
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:55,250
Speaker 1: we're talking about the plastic.

204
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:59,590
Speaker 0: The next level is gonna be where every hobbyist who has a physical hobby will have one.

205
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:06,290
Speaker 0: Absolutely, because that's when you're like you're making a Gundam model and you break something like up better But another one for not a policeman partner exactly.

206
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:10,649
Speaker 0: So I think it'll just it'll pull it but almost everyone.

207
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:12,049
Speaker 0: Who's a human?

208
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,453
Speaker 1: Who is every?

209
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:17,890
Speaker 1: every nerd and art person will will need will want one even whether they can afford one or not.

210
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,189
Speaker 1: But it'll get cheaper - it'll be like 200 bucks like a desk yet.

211
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:27,530
Speaker 0: So my hope is that everyone in the industrialized world who's otherwise mostly achieved Maslow's pyramid like you have food.

212
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:29,230
Speaker 0: You're not living in a crippling poverty.

213
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:35,787
Speaker 0: You're gonna have some hobby that involves physical components of some kind and I think that will like that level.

214
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:47,728
Speaker 0: once printers get That reliable when there is reliable and probably still as expensive as an inkjet printer I think you're gonna see we're like 60 70 percent of internet at households will have one within 30 years.

215
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,483
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm really like.

216
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:52,031
Speaker 0: I'm not sure I'm not married to that I'm just.

217
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:58,882
Speaker 1: but I mean like how even if you have a use for one if you don't use it that often you're probably better Off just having someone else print your 3d

218
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:01,536
Speaker 0: things, but that's another interesting trend We're seeing is that like

219
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:02,502
Speaker 1: Amazon store this

220
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:10,921
Speaker 0: kind of an aside, but young people I mean all the car companies and they're still going crazy about this if you pay attention to like mainstream media They're like Millennials aren't buying cars.

221
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:14,990
Speaker 0: They're all trying to figure out like why Don't live in stupid suburbs like dumbasses.

222
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:29,070
Speaker 0: Yep But part of it too is that young people who live in cities in my opinion are way more willing to share Things that require a lot of capital investment with other people in their demographic or even just other people.

223
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,530
Speaker 0: I mean most people who live in New York can't afford to have their own rec room with a pool table in it.

224
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,152
Speaker 0: So guess what?

225
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:39,787
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of pool halls that you can play pool and instead it's just.

226
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:43,609
Speaker 1: that's just cities Period so but in the suburbs.

227
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:47,990
Speaker 0: So cars are the same way now in the sense that a lot of people are willing to share cars.

228
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:52,150
Speaker 0: Use their friends cars or use things like zipcon and taxis.

229
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:56,710
Speaker 1: But again, oh, he's drive that you don't go anywhere and you just stay home and internet.

230
00:14:57,032 --> 00:14:59,810
Speaker 0: So 3d printers are again the same way.

231
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:08,688
Speaker 0: I know enough people who have 3d printers to where if I want to print anything 3d I can ask a whole bunch of different friends or go to this Amazon store or go shape ways.

232
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:19,239
Speaker 0: Yeah So, maybe we won't need them all in all of our houses because so enough of the people in this young tech demographic will have Them to where everyone has one.

233
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:26,810
Speaker 0: It's like even if you don't even if not everyone we know has a smartphone Everyone we know is almost always in the presence of someone they know who has a smartphone.

234
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:36,890
Speaker 0: So in other news, this is kind of amazing a New virus was discovered the kind that hurts people of now hurts computers.

235
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,209
Speaker 0: We're not sure what it does compete people people virus.

236
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:43,404
Speaker 0: It hurts individual cells arguably, but you know a lot of viruses are pretty benign.

237
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:44,950
Speaker 0: This one's the bacteriophage.

238
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,790
Speaker 0: Okay, you know your guy kills all the bacteria not necessarily, you know.

239
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,570
Speaker 0: You know the guy in every biology textbook in the world goes in the bacteria who multiplies.

240
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,702
Speaker 1: He looks like an octagon with a little bug behind him.

241
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:55,964
Speaker 1: Yes.

242
00:15:56,004 --> 00:16:01,770
Speaker 1: He looks like the little bug Yeah with a little and then he explodes the bacteria in it or the cell and a million little viruses come out.

243
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,236
Speaker 0: So well, they don't always explode.

244
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:03,678
Speaker 0: There's other.

245
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,065
Speaker 0: they can all work in different ways.

246
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:05,527
Speaker 0: Sure.

247
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:16,697
Speaker 0: So I knew one of those was discovered and apparently it is infected possibly the vast majority of all humans and has been Present for a long time.

248
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:19,025
Speaker 0: Okay, and yet somehow we never noticed it.

249
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,250
Speaker 1: Well, it's really fucking small.

250
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,830
Speaker 0: So yeah So there's this whole story that and if it's not like a high quantity in your body.

251
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:32,923
Speaker 0: It's sort of a newly discovered virus has been found by a San Diego State University team to live inside more than half of all Human gut cells sampled.

252
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:36,918
Speaker 0: Yep There's a cool complicated story of how they found it.

253
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:40,109
Speaker 0: they're trying to figure out what it does all sorts of things about it.

254
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:45,865
Speaker 0: there's the article talks a lot about Why it was so hard to find it and it looks like every other kind of virus.

255
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,693
Speaker 1: you pass right over it when you're looking In the microscope.

256
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:48,879
Speaker 0: It's a little more complicated than that.

257
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,508
Speaker 1: We don't sample a lot of gut cells.

258
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:51,692
Speaker 0: people One.

259
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:56,168
Speaker 0: they sample gut cells via fecal matter primarily or as the scientists who wrote this article said poo.

260
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:57,695
Speaker 0: Sure He's like poo.

261
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:58,700
Speaker 0: He just calls it poo.

262
00:16:58,761 --> 00:16:59,203
Speaker 1: There you go.

263
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:05,021
Speaker 0: So Remember things that we think about as common knowledge.

264
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:11,343
Speaker 0: a lot of those things were not discovered But relatively recently case in point vitamins go.

265
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,470
Speaker 0: look up when different vitamins were discovered.

266
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,122
Speaker 0: We have not known about vitamins for that long guys.

267
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:17,869
Speaker 1: Flintstones vitamins, right?

268
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,773
Speaker 1: You know why they're Flintstones vitamins?

269
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:28,154
Speaker 1: because we discovered that shit and we started selling them when the Flintstones were hot when Flintstones hot 70s 60s and 70s.

270
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:33,210
Speaker 0: This is the second time you've brought up Flintstones in a casual conversation by a tangent.

271
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:33,893
Speaker 0: It's the.

272
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:35,662
Speaker 1: it's what's it called if we ever done.

273
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,190
Speaker 0: is the bear shitting in the woods syndrome?

274
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:38,595
Speaker 1: No, that's what.

275
00:17:38,636 --> 00:17:42,170
Speaker 1: no, that's what I call that thing where you see the same like word being used.

276
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:44,520
Speaker 0: Yes, I call that bear shitting in the woods.

277
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,750
Speaker 1: Why is it bear shitting in the woods in George Carlin?

278
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:51,630
Speaker 1: I'd ever heard that bit anyway, I'm gonna go find it on YouTube after this anyway.

279
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:58,680
Speaker 0: So, yeah vitamins were discovered relatively recently and The whole reason I'm bringing this up is one.

280
00:17:58,781 --> 00:17:59,946
Speaker 0: It's real science news.

281
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:00,710
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

282
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:09,880
Speaker 0: Some research might come out of this but most importantly the virus has the best name I have ever heard for a virus ever.

283
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,490
Speaker 0: It is called the ass phage.

284
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,199
Speaker 1: Oh my god, cr.

285
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:21,408
Speaker 0: It's crass phage, but capital CR Lower case capital a s capital a s s ph a GE.

286
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,471
Speaker 1: There you go.

287
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,419
Speaker 1: It is the ass phage virus and this crass is also a great word the crass and crass phage.

288
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,798
Speaker 0: the ass phage Slash shot is mostly focusing on the name.

289
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,941
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't you?

290
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:35,366
Speaker 1: what else is there to focus on?

291
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:53,695
Speaker 0: and here's a comment I am the last author on the paper Mmm, and it was discovered by my bioinformatics lab in the CS department at SDS you it was named after our analysis software CR uppercase a SS cross assembly because they're Investigating poo.

292
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:57,049
Speaker 1: So that's why they named it that way because their software is about poo.

293
00:18:57,491 --> 00:19:00,629
Speaker 0: So thus they decided to go all out on that kind of like out IBM.

294
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,416
Speaker 0: We had a huge server we were building.

295
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:06,530
Speaker 0: that was just a data store like hundreds of terrible ridiculous storage server.

296
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:08,023
Speaker 0: so we're like, what should we call it?

297
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:13,610
Speaker 0: and We came up on the BMFS which stood for officially big motherfucking server.

298
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,059
Speaker 0: But we came up with some other reason.

299
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,770
Speaker 0: that acronym was there so we wouldn't get in trouble.

300
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:21,109
Speaker 0: But I present for your consideration the ass phage.

301
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:29,999
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the day.

302
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:37,500
Speaker 0: You all may or may not be familiar with the music video to a song entitled turned down for what what what?

303
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:42,279
Speaker 0: The music video is pretty special in its own way.

304
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,860
Speaker 0: It's the most special but that's not my thing of the day.

305
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,558
Speaker 0: I'll link to it because you really should see what it is.

306
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:52,056
Speaker 1: Possibly You can handle it if you can handle it.

307
00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:52,679
Speaker 1: You should watch it.

308
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:53,984
Speaker 0: So it's it's.

309
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:54,185
Speaker 0: it's.

310
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:55,790
Speaker 1: a lot of people can't handle it.

311
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:58,560
Speaker 0: It's pretty turned down pretty unhandleable.

312
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:00,478
Speaker 1: I don't know it for what but what?

313
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:06,419
Speaker 0: Our whole thing over the weekend with when we had friends over was the Skeletor?

314
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:06,640
Speaker 0: what?

315
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:08,444
Speaker 0: So unrelated.

316
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:12,179
Speaker 0: Oh, I could mash those up pretty well turned down for what what what?

317
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:20,000
Speaker 0: So this is that music video but the music has been removed and they have foleyed in all the.

318
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,425
Speaker 1: What is this foley?

319
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:21,727
Speaker 1: I don't know.

320
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:22,711
Speaker 1: you give using that word.

321
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:24,056
Speaker 1: I don't know where that word came from.

322
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:24,859
Speaker 0: really, okay.

323
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:33,377
Speaker 0: So, you know in a movie when like you see a dog run by like in a house Like just this dog in a house running by and you hear like their nails like running by on the hardwood.

324
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:39,170
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm That doesn't get recorded When they're filming it obviously, but why would it be called foley?

325
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:40,696
Speaker 0: Oh Lee is what that's called foley.

326
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:41,960
Speaker 1: It's called dubbing.

327
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,866
Speaker 0: No, dubbing is the voices.

328
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:53,285
Speaker 0: foley is when you recreate in a sound studio Individual sounds or like sound effects to go along with a movie Sound effects.

329
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,549

00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,820
Speaker 1: I don't disbelieve you I just I just didn't know there was a special word.

333
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,800
Speaker 0: Foley is the reproduction of everyday sound effects that are added to film video and other media in post-production to enhance audio quality.

334
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:06,787
Speaker 1: I didn't disbelieve you.

335
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:11,047
Speaker 1: I just said that's a word I hadn't heard You just say put in sound effects.

336
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:15,721
Speaker 0: putting in sound effects is where you take an existing sound effects library and add sound effects to Something.

337
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:26,678
Speaker 0: foley is when you take like a melon and then you put like a knife in your fist and you stab it And then you you and you stab it along with the movie to make the sound of stabbing.

338
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:29,349
Speaker 1: Just making sound effects.

339
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:40,763
Speaker 0: Yes making sound effects for movies Okay Especially adding in like the little background clicks and things like when people bump into each other someone gets hit someone drops a phone book Like the.

340
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:43,252
Speaker 0: did you ever read on how they made the lightsaber sounds in Star Wars?

Speaker 0: So I don't hack any portals.

403
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,407

00:24:31,514 --> 00:24:33,720
Speaker 1: the underground part is like five minutes.

407
00:24:34,142 --> 00:24:36,835

419
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:17,560
Speaker 1: Oh, you're not getting any bigger.

420
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:19,390

425
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,139
Speaker 0: We flew to Australia to do a panel at a PAX on purpose because we wanted to.

426
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:40,217
Speaker 0: yes They didn't pay us to do that, right?

427
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:47,610
Speaker 1: Anyway, but I don't want to I don't want to assume but we were worried, you know Just in case maybe we wouldn't get a panel at.

428
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,280
Speaker 1: PAX is here because it's bigger and badder and awesomer.

429
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:53,820
Speaker 1: So I bought some tickets to PAX and cuz I'm good at internetting.

430
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,651
Speaker 1: I got four four weekend passes.

431
00:25:56,712 --> 00:26:05,520
Speaker 0: now if you want to know how hard it is to get these passes I want to point out that Scott and I Noticed badges went on sale and entered the queue at roughly the silk within the same minute.

432
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:13,997
Speaker 0: Definitely Scott got four day badges the maximum you can get four for four day badge And it was sold out by the time I got through the queue.

433
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:14,460
Speaker 0: That's right.

434
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,353
Speaker 1: So I bought the four four day badges and our panel was accepted.

435
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:22,945
Speaker 1: so we don't need any of them But Emily needs one.

436
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:23,709
Speaker 1: So Emily gets one.

437
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:25,960
Speaker 1: Yes, and then they cost a lot of fucking money.

438
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,450
Speaker 1: They're like a hundred and ten dollars each.

439
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:28,759
Speaker 1: So I don't care if you hate me.

440
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:31,491
Speaker 1: I got to sell at least one of these fuckers to get some money back.

441
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:32,636
Speaker 1: cuz yeah, I have money.

442
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:34,186
Speaker 1: that's $440.

443
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:58,315
Speaker 1: that's a lot of fucking money I could have bought in a really fancy camera lens or all kinds of crazy shit with that money I don't buy but the other two We will sacrifice for you, maybe We're going to use them for self-promotion Advertising purposes because maybe you know, like I said geek nights isn't getting any bigger But maybe with the injection of packs badges it can be.

444
00:26:58,335 --> 00:26:59,519
Speaker 1: so here's what we're gonna do.

445
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:05,580
Speaker 1: We need you people who listen to geek nights who want to go to packs, but don't have tickets.

446
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:07,846
Speaker 1: We're gonna do the same stupid thing.

447
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:08,669
Speaker 1: Everyone else does.

448
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:13,345
Speaker 1: we're gonna make a tweet, right and You can retweet it.

449
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:17,240
Speaker 1: or you can make a tweet to like your favorite geek nights episode.

450
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:26,984
Speaker 1: You know It has to link to us in some way to promote us and has to have hashtags of geek nights and also the hashtag of packs two hashtags Right.

451
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:37,391
Speaker 1: that way it'll get promoted when people search for packs related tweets And also people will know the name of geek nights and also be linked to our shit Though you could even just link till.

452
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:38,700
Speaker 1: it doesn't have to be a geek nights episode.

453
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,659
Speaker 1: You could link to one of our YouTube videos.

454
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:46,020
Speaker 1: It is the link to some of our content in some way even a pecs panel and have those two hashtags.

455
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:49,076
Speaker 1: Or you can even be like at geek nice hashtag packs.

456
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:49,759
Speaker 1: That's okay, too.

457
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:52,060
Speaker 0: Well, the I geek nice can't be at the beginning of it, obviously.

458
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,580
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we're not gonna guess and I don't know we might be able to add in G plus and Facebook.

459
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,503
Speaker 1: The issue there is.

460
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:02,337
Speaker 1: we have to be able to find your message when we do a search, right?

461
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:02,920
Speaker 0: That's all you.

462
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,789
Speaker 1: Twitter only I think for now Twitter only.

463
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:11,254
Speaker 1: if I figure out how to search for like everyone who did this You know G plus or Facebook.

464
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,200
Speaker 1: we can do it there also.

465
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,304
Speaker 1: but for now Twitter only.

466
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:27,997
Speaker 1: if you do that, we will randomly select someone and On the day, I receive the packs badges in the mail I don't know what day that's gonna be and Then I will immediately that day go to the post office and mail the two of them to that person if you

467
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:28,640
Speaker 0: wish if it

468
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:30,365
Speaker 1: Direct messaging them on

469
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:31,207
Speaker 0: Twitter

470
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:32,752
Speaker 1: and getting their address for whatever.

471
00:28:32,772 --> 00:28:38,538
Speaker 1: if you fail to direct message me back within like the 24 hours, I can pick someone else and that's how it's gonna go.

472
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:47,975
Speaker 0: Yep on the off chance that for whatever reason we can't mail them to you because you're like you You know a person without an address or something weird we can give them to you at packs

473
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:55,180
Speaker 1: and I will swear That you know you if you meet us on the Thursday morning or Thursday pretty much any time after I land

00:28:55,562 --> 00:28:57,112
Speaker 0: Well, I'm gonna be a fax dev the whole time.

475
00:28:57,132 --> 00:28:57,454

Speaker 0: is these sky-high?

479
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,000
Speaker 1: There will be plenty of opportunities if you are a person who has your shit together to find us in Seattle and get the badges.

480
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,060
Speaker 1: I promise you that you know you paying for your airfare and hotel, which we are not contributing to in any way shape or form.

481
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,964

482
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:15,600
Speaker 0: Oh, I was about to promote the prepack sky-high tabletop play benefiting food.

Speaker 1: Well, there you go.

486
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,439
Speaker 1: So you're not going to that unless you already have tickets to it

487
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:21,846
Speaker 0: Yep,

494
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,379
Speaker 1: I hope we don't get in trouble with some like state law about contests and prizes or anything like that.

495
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,150
Speaker 0: Yep, basically for people listening.

496
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:52,853
Speaker 0: It'll be.

497
00:29:52,873 --> 00:29:54,158
Speaker 0: you have to have hashtag.

498

Speaker 0: geek nights Hashtag packs, they're separate hashtags You can also have at geek nights.

499
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:05,966
Speaker 1: Yeah Can't be the first thing in your post because then no one will see it except us and it has to link to Something that we created.

500
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:10,660
Speaker 1: some of our content must be linked with a URL and it must be geek nights content.

501
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:22,900
Speaker 0: If you link to like my personal blog Yeah, you can't link to one of my netrunner videos But it's okay to link to my rims YouTube account because that's basically the official geek nights one and all our packs lectures are there.

502
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,517
Speaker 1: I guess you could link directly to the channel.

503
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:27,285
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you could link to a geek.

504
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:27,888
Speaker 1: nice presents you.

505
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:30,980
Speaker 1: Tana has to be some sort of geek nights content.

506
00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:33,474
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, that's it.

507
00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:33,878
Speaker 1: All

508
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:39,214
Speaker 0: right so Our friends had a baby and the babies a

509
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:40,707
Speaker 1: lot of friends who had babies Yep

510
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:49,339
Speaker 0: But the one of them had one a while ago and this one's formed up to the point where still kind of preverbal like Talk, but it's that kind of not making sense talk.

511
00:30:50,242 --> 00:30:57,739
Speaker 0: But what I'm gonna go what we noticed that was interesting was watching this kid because I've been very rarely around young children.

512
00:30:58,881 --> 00:30:59,463
Speaker 0: What I am.

513
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:00,927
Speaker 1: that is for the better.

514
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:04,458
Speaker 1: our society's rules are functioning as design.

515
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:06,588
Speaker 0: Hey kid You want to learn the words?

516
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:08,639
Speaker 0: They're gonna make your mom flip the fuck out.

517
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:10,979
Speaker 0: They got a bit a little older for that.

518
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:19,571
Speaker 1: So I told him hey if you want to know anything about the history of your parents or anything about them Yep, you just find anyone named Scott.

519
00:31:19,692 --> 00:31:20,940
Speaker 1: There's like two or three of us.

520
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:26,097
Speaker 0: We all knew your parents before they were dating each other both of them.

521
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:26,820
Speaker 1: That's right.

522
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:29,229
Speaker 0: So, uh what I noticed?

523
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:31,197
Speaker 0: because you know, they came over and seen him forever.

524
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:33,164
Speaker 0: They're in our apartment The kids running around up.

525
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:37,820
Speaker 0: His middle name is danger, which is like double awesome, but that's all before the opposite of awesome.

526
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,009
Speaker 1: They'll find out when he goes to school whether that's awesome or not.

527
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:41,355
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty awesome.

528
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:42,400
Speaker 0: It's very much.

529
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:49,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're not some student in school who may be positively or negatively Appreciating that.

530
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:53,400
Speaker 0: so I noticed something when he was running around our apartment doing his kid thing.

531
00:31:53,561 --> 00:32:06,343
Speaker 0: he was a kid by all normal ways, but He went around seeking out anything that looked like electronics and the first thing he would do is try to interact with a Touchscreen on it

532
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:07,608
Speaker 1: or push buttons

533
00:32:07,748 --> 00:32:08,270
Speaker 0: if there was no

534
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,840
Speaker 1: wanted to push buttons and touch screens and look at screens.

535
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:12,899
Speaker 0: Yep, he would push the button and it wasn't just random.

536
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:19,960
Speaker 0: He if he was pushing buttons and it wasn't having any visible outward effect He'd figure out they were fake.

537
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,755
Speaker 0: Like I gave him my controller like my big arcade stick and it wasn't plugged in anything.

538
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,099
Speaker 0: So he messes with it.

539
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:32,079
Speaker 0: He loi why he immediately looks up the TV while he's messing with it realizes it's not actually plugged in and got mad at me.

540
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:41,380
Speaker 1: But then when he like if it got a reaction like once I gave him my GoPro and he pushed the button and he didn't Understand that it was a camera, but it beeped when you push the buttons.

541
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:42,619
Speaker 1: So he liked pushing those.

542
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:51,639
Speaker 0: But once he figured out how to turn off the TV He wanted nothing more than to make sure that TV was fucking off or on again.

543
00:32:52,202 --> 00:32:57,958
Speaker 0: And the most beautiful thing though was we were you know, we had the Hgpc plugged in so we had it like a Windows desktop.

544
00:32:57,998 --> 00:32:59,974
Speaker 0: on the TV There's a YouTube video that we had been playing.

545
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:00,559
Speaker 0: it was paused.

546
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:08,100
Speaker 0: The first thing he did when he saw the TV is ran over and hit the TV screen itself his finger.

547
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:12,417
Speaker 0: He hit the pause button Specifically to make it play again.

548
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,947
Speaker 0: Now my TV is not a touchscreen.

549
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:15,910
Speaker 0: that obviously didn't work.

550
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,535
Speaker 0: But think about this.

551
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:24,499
Speaker 0: a kid who's like a year old Already understands touchscreens more than most adult humans that I know.

552
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:31,869
Speaker 0: Kids growing up now are in some ways Fundamentally different from kids who grew up in earlier era.

553
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:38,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, I grew up with a keyboard and a gamepad So I fundamentally understand those things.

554
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:42,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also know how to use a touchscreen Exactly, but I won.

555
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:51,320
Speaker 0: I'm starting to wonder more about what kids who were growing up now Like what they're gonna be like in terms of technology because I'm what I love is a technology issue.

556
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,279
Speaker 1: This is more like a child psychology issue.

557
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:59,860
Speaker 0: Ah, but the technology is allowing child interactions that in the history of humanity basically couldn't exist.

558
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:08,780
Speaker 0: Okay, like we're kids have access to the kinds of information environments that like it's almost unprecedented the interactivity that they can have.

559
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:12,540
Speaker 1: There's been something unprecedented in every era of child.

560
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,215
Speaker 1: No one has raised children that grew up similar conditions that they grew up in.

561
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:28,600
Speaker 0: arguably there were multi-hundred-year spans throughout many of the great empires of history where Multiple generations in a row grew up under effectively identical cultural and political regimes.

562
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:36,219
Speaker 0: Those were dark ages and they were dark for a reason up also like during non dark ages like ancient Greece and places like that.

563
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,306
Speaker 0: It's just a lot.

564
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:44,179
Speaker 0: of those societies were for long Like stretches in the micro were pretty static in terms of like child rearing.

565
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:46,826
Speaker 1: Okay, those are societies.

566
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:47,408
Speaker 1: No one living.

567
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:48,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus what about that?

568
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:56,280
Speaker 0: I mean from Cro-Magnon to like the births of Civilizations and writing and agriculture and all that people raising kids.

569
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:57,808
Speaker 0: Nothing really changed much.

570
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:05,475
Speaker 0: the rate of change of technology Relation to the span of human lifetime is accelerating and the rate of acceleration is itself accelerating.

571
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:07,100
Speaker 0: that rate by the way is called jerk.

572
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:09,845
Speaker 1: Why don't we just call it rim?

573
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:13,860
Speaker 0: then I'm the acceleration of an acceleration that you're a jerk.

574
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,955
Speaker 0: So I realized - looking back at me as a kid I mean I grew up without computers.

575
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:37,460
Speaker 0: computers came After I was already like really sentient and already could do math and stuff Apple - in kindergarten and we didn't have our a 2600 and a video game before kindergarten and an NES in elementary school.

576
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:40,529
Speaker 0: I mean, I didn't have a cell phone until college.

577
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:42,535
Speaker 1: I didn't own one till college.

578
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,180
Speaker 1: My family had them when I was in high school.

579
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,046
Speaker 0: Yep, my family also had them when I was in high school.

580
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,555
Speaker 0: I would occasionally borrow it up smartphones.

581
00:35:48,655 --> 00:35:51,887
Speaker 0: I didn't have until like 2009.

582
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:57,979
Speaker 1: smartphones Existed when we were in late college because Steve Pomeroy had them.

583
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:01,792
Speaker 1: But I didn't have one until the day the iPhone.

584
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:06,740
Speaker 1: I didn't personally own what I had blackberries from the job I got as soon as I graduated college or just counted.

585
00:36:07,182 --> 00:36:10,476
Speaker 1: But I didn't personally own one until the day the iPhone 3g came out.

586
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:11,440
Speaker 1: I was in line about it.

587
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:23,351
Speaker 0: I was a functioning adult on my third for real career job when I first had in my possession a device That would show me a live map of where I was with GPS data.

588
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:24,754
Speaker 1: iPhone 3g do that.

589
00:36:24,894 --> 00:36:26,037
Speaker 0: I didn't have an iPhone 3g.

590
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:29,087
Speaker 0: I Didn't say first thing that existed.

591
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:30,313
Speaker 0: I said I owned one.

592
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:35,217
Speaker 1: I mean you could have had the palm trio Yeah, I could have but I didn't or one of those windows CE phones.

593
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:37,366
Speaker 0: I bought a Symbian phone.

594
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,316
Speaker 0: I used my work blackberry for like six months and then I bought a palm pre.

595
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:40,878
Speaker 0: There you go.

596
00:36:41,621 --> 00:36:47,540
Speaker 0: So I didn't grow up having a lot of like could directly always connected access to information.

597
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:57,740
Speaker 0: And when I think back at my life the way I interacted with the world was Fundamentally different from the way I interact with it now I mean I had to explore neighborhoods because there was no way for me to know what was around.

598
00:36:59,043 --> 00:37:00,199
Speaker 0: What flipped through the yellow pages?

599
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,484
Speaker 0: Go through a road atlas.

600
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,031
Speaker 0: There's like 15 years out of date.

601
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:08,032
Speaker 1: use triple-a because we're driving to Florida What I bring out a triptych when I go home.

602
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,340
Speaker 0: I got through the highlighter.

603
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:13,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, the guy would like print out maps and highlight your route for you And you know what.

604
00:37:13,263 --> 00:37:15,255
Speaker 0: if something went wrong on that trip you were fucked.

605
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:26,500
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm In fact, uh, I remember in the old days I used my triple-a card which was long expired But the triple-a website only checked to see if the number was valid.

606
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:28,958
Speaker 0: It didn't check to see if the account was active to let you log in.

607
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:38,098
Speaker 0: So throughout all of our IT I could go generate trip ticks and I stopped doing that once Map quest and Google Maps we use my best because Google Maps did not yet exist.

608
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:41,789
Speaker 1: I'm used Yahoo Maps when map quest is giving shitty directions.

609
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we kept using them because Google Maps version 1 was garbage.

610
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,940
Speaker 1: And then Google Maps became good and all the other maps died.

611
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:57,172
Speaker 0: But even then we would before a trip like someone's job was to figure out the route Print all the maps for the entire trip because we got on the road without those maps.

612
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,160
Speaker 0: Oh bad news at a convention.

613
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,213
Speaker 1: So we're mostly just talking about olden days now and not talking about kids at all.

614
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,599
Speaker 0: So think about kids now.

615
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,186
Speaker 0: It's a growing up one.

616
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:16,499
Speaker 0: So you agree they can look up Anything at any time all the time thus eliminating 90% of the conversations I had as a child.

617
00:38:17,802 --> 00:38:21,100
Speaker 0: Like a kid like once it could get to the point where they start using technology.

618
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:24,699
Speaker 0: Why will the Kelvin's dad situation ever happen again?

619
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:31,362
Speaker 0: Will a kid ever ask their parents how something works when they know that they can just type it into the internet and they'll get An answer?

620
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:34,712
Speaker 1: well kids in elementary school ever be like in Mortal Kombat.

621
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:37,240
Speaker 1: There's a secret you can get boo boo ballad.

622
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:39,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know who's gonna say that?

623
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,399
Speaker 0: I have a theory about what's gonna happen.

624
00:38:42,441 --> 00:38:44,066
Speaker 0: the divide like we always talk about.

625
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:49,523
Speaker 0: the digital divide and how it's wide and how it's why than anyone realizes and way more important Than anyone realizes.

626
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:51,308
Speaker 0: I think it's even worse than that.

627
00:38:52,191 --> 00:39:16,820
Speaker 0: I think because I've seen this already the children of People I have seen who themselves are not supercomputer are also not supercomputer Mm-hmm, but the children of people who are computer are so much more computer than even their parents already That I think that it's not like the computers and the internet and all this access is gonna democratize our culture.

628
00:39:17,382 --> 00:39:28,179
Speaker 0: I think the divide between digital kids and not connected kids is gonna be so great that That is going to be the primary former of clicks in physical schools among young kids growing up.

629
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:36,140
Speaker 1: I'd see I mean I go to the mentoring and it's at a computer high school a public computer high school the Academy for software engineering.

630
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:41,508
Speaker 1: yeah, and I go and I see these high school kids right and There are a few who are.

631
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:42,775
Speaker 1: those nerdy kids are coding.

632
00:39:42,795 --> 00:39:50,360
Speaker 1: They're gonna be Steve Pomeroy But most of them Don't computer right even though they're out of computer school.

633
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,797
Speaker 1: They can use a computer, but they don't understand how computer works.

634
00:39:54,918 --> 00:39:56,524
Speaker 1: for reals They don't have.

635
00:39:56,544 --> 00:40:00,380
Speaker 1: they did that instinct to Google everything, right?

636
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,216
Speaker 1: It's like they're still reading like video game magazines from GameStop, right?

637
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,667
Speaker 1: They don't read Polygon right.

638
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:08,375
Speaker 1: they don't know really what's going on.

639
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:09,420
Speaker 1: There's one kid.

640
00:40:10,022 --> 00:40:14,194
Speaker 1: Metal Gear is his thing number one thing right of all his geekeries.

641
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:16,400
Speaker 1: for me Metal Gear is like man, right?

642
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,668
Speaker 1: Not into Metal Gear really.

643
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:21,650
Speaker 1: I like old Metal Gear, but I know Metal Gear, but I'm not super into it.

644
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,760
Speaker 1: I can't get past like two rooms in Metal Gear solid.

645
00:40:24,403 --> 00:40:25,809
Speaker 0: Right, I didn't like Metal Gear solid.

646
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:28,139
Speaker 1: I knew more about Metal Gear than this kid because I internet.

647
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:29,821
Speaker 1: I Mean.

648
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,143
Speaker 1: he knew.

649
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:37,322
Speaker 1: he knew like all the Metal Gear games that existed He knew what you would know about Metal Gear if you went to GameStop and played every Metal Gear game and read video game Magazines.

650
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:40,250
Speaker 1: right, but I knew who Deo Kojima was and he doesn't.

651
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,600
Speaker 0: so that's my question are his parents internet?

652
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,624
Speaker 0: Do you have any way to know?

653
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:44,664
Speaker 0: I

654
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:45,568
Speaker 1: don't know

655
00:40:46,030 --> 00:41:06,240
Speaker 0: because I'm starting to think I'm worrying that When we like when I see kids that tends to be kids of internet people and those kids seem like like I see them on A path that could not have existed in the world I grew up in like though they're gonna grow up to be so much more reliant upon and connected to technology than I ever was.

656
00:41:06,823 --> 00:41:15,300
Speaker 0: But at the same time when I interact with other kids I feel like they're less internet than kids who grew up in the era of no internet.

657
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:18,849
Speaker 1: It's also, you know the computers, you know, it's like we had were.

658
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:23,819
Speaker 1: if we wanted to internet right we had to do the hard way right.

659
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,829
Speaker 1: They just like Facebook whatever true.

660
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:30,960
Speaker 1: No, so they end up not learning anything about actual computers.

661
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:33,793
Speaker 0: but at the same time not everyone has to learn about the core computers.

662
00:41:33,813 --> 00:41:36,063
Speaker 0: because I see some kids who Like.

663
00:41:36,183 --> 00:41:39,999
Speaker 0: they use computers effectively like if they don't know something they immediately google it.

664
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:42,157
Speaker 0: But most kids don't even do.

665
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:44,468
Speaker 1: that I'm saying is I think it's the percent.

666
00:41:44,488 --> 00:41:47,720
Speaker 1: All right, so back in the day some percentage of kids are gonna be computer.

667
00:41:48,623 --> 00:41:50,108
Speaker 1: I don't think the percentage is increased.

668
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:53,380
Speaker 1: It's the same percentage as it was when we were in school.

669
00:41:53,572 --> 00:42:02,688
Speaker 1: Yeah right But of that percentage in our day a hundred percent of the kids who are gonna be computer II Had to learn everything for reals because there was no other way.

670
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:03,190
Speaker 0: Yep.

671
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:12,783
Speaker 1: Now same percentage of total kids will be computer internet II but a smaller percentage of that will actually learn anything about how Computers work.

672
00:42:13,204 --> 00:42:19,159
Speaker 1: and the other person, you know of that small percent now just use computers and the same number of people don't know anything.

673
00:42:19,379 --> 00:42:23,280
Speaker 0: Yep There's also this other factor that they just Facebook and Candy Crush.

674
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:28,680
Speaker 0: The other thing that they have that we didn't have is everyone else around them recording everything forever.

675
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,120
Speaker 0: I mean all of us posted embarrassing shit when we were in like elementary school and middle school on internet places.

676
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:36,152
Speaker 1: I wish there had been more that would see.

677
00:42:36,172 --> 00:42:37,258
Speaker 1: here's the thing people complain about.

678
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:39,259
Speaker 1: they're like Oh no ruin your life.

679
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:45,340
Speaker 0: I would give anything to be able to go back with things that I owe much that there was more documentation.

680
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:54,939
Speaker 1: I can go back and just see You know pictures videos Recorded accounts of dates and times because I don't remember much.

681
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:58,096
Speaker 1: Yep, if I had things recorded back in the day.

682
00:42:58,257 --> 00:42:58,740
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

683
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,429
Speaker 1: I mean if I've been able to save my pokemons to the cloud in high school and my original pokemons I still have them now.

684
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:08,591
Speaker 0: the other day I found a single picture that I didn't know existed.

685
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:10,920
Speaker 0: That was a picture of the inside of our apartment at our IT.

686
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:12,419
Speaker 0: That wasn't that long ago.

687
00:43:13,163 --> 00:43:19,109
Speaker 0: It was like finding the remnants of the Holy Grail Like I'm looking in the background like look at that CRT.

688
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,393
Speaker 0: who the fuck is that?

689
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:22,560
Speaker 0: Oh, right Scott on that Israeli flag.

690
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:24,593
Speaker 0: What are those huge speakers?

691
00:43:24,674 --> 00:43:25,499
Speaker 0: What happened to those?

692
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:27,985
Speaker 0: Like huge speak.

693
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:31,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had these huge speakers just like laying on the floor next to my computer.

694
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:36,645
Speaker 1: They were like a foot and a half where those part of that like Set only a foot and a half.

695
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:37,709
Speaker 1: that was that black sound.

696
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:40,880
Speaker 0: right that awful sound system that you used as your speakers.

697
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:42,867
Speaker 0: Yeah uses my speakers and sorry.

698
00:43:42,927 --> 00:43:45,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought you meant huge speakers like, you know person tall.

699
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:46,960
Speaker 0: No not one foot.

700
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:54,762
Speaker 0: Yeah, no those part of that sound system Yeah And it was the boombox I had and I look at the screen and I saw that I was playing Final Fantasy 4 on my Computer.

701
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:55,184
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

702
00:43:55,304 --> 00:43:57,896
Speaker 0: Just randomly and it looked like I was fighting as a Romans Paladin.

703
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:06,218
Speaker 0: Yeah but Kids now are growing up in a world where all everything they do is cataloged forever.

704
00:44:06,238 --> 00:44:17,039
Speaker 0: if Their friends and or family are internet people Mm-hmm I think there's gonna be another digital divide between kids who have this documentation of their lives and kids who don't.

705
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:20,520
Speaker 1: Mmm, because if your parents have documentation of your life, right?

706
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,720
Speaker 1: I mean we want documentation of our lives.

707
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,733
Speaker 1: But what if your life was really shitty and you have documentation of it?

708
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:26,818
Speaker 1: And so it is everyone else.

709
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:29,233
Speaker 0: Yeah It could be bad it's good or bad.

710
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:33,707
Speaker 0: the thing is it's It's good and bad.

711
00:44:33,928 --> 00:44:36,580
Speaker 0: it's fundamentally different and that's the only thing we can say about it.

712
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,806
Speaker 0: We can't say if it's good or bad.

713
00:44:37,846 --> 00:44:39,775
Speaker 0: It's just different and inevitable good and bad.

714
00:44:40,398 --> 00:44:47,920
Speaker 0: Ah And yeah, well, maybe maybe it's not bad, but there's a short-term bad and a long-term good anyway.

715
00:44:48,523 --> 00:44:51,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you got a time machine, you'll go take back and take video of my life.

716
00:44:51,737 --> 00:44:52,059
Speaker 1: Please do.

717
00:44:53,062 --> 00:44:54,129
Speaker 1: I don't care what happened then.

718
00:44:54,169 --> 00:44:54,713
Speaker 1: I want to see it.

719
00:44:55,176 --> 00:45:02,640
Speaker 0: So I guess I Don't know what to do about the divide because I'm thinking about that more and more and I think it's it's gonna be like.

720
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:04,667
Speaker 0: I think the digital divide there's.

721
00:45:04,748 --> 00:45:14,880
Speaker 0: the way different children grow up with different access to technology is More controlled by their parents and the culture of their family than it is by a lot of other factors.

722
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:27,114
Speaker 0: And I think a lot of kids who would otherwise be internet e and smart if their parents are not also pushing them toward internet They will not internet and they will just be completely left behind by their peers who internet.

723
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:29,099
Speaker 1: let's predict this horrible dystopia.

724
00:45:29,723 --> 00:45:36,774
Speaker 1: I don't know if it'll be a dystopia where the the Technological elite rule and the people who don't understand computers are peasants.

725
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:37,937
Speaker 0: That is what's gonna happen.

726
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:38,599
Speaker 0: I just don't know.

727
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:40,988
Speaker 1: That's just what you want to happen.

728
00:45:41,068 --> 00:45:42,013
Speaker 0: No, I really don't.

729
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:52,353
Speaker 1: I I imagine I think it's gonna be more like ghost in the shell right where yeah, there are people who are super internet, but People are getting by and people aren't peasants, right?

730
00:45:52,373 --> 00:46:09,478
Speaker 0: They're just getting by an internet world I guess I just I imagined a world where everyone I interact with on a daily basis Had the personal capability of googling things they didn't know And I realized that that is utopia for me.

731
00:46:09,823 --> 00:46:17,840
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm If the average person that I talked to Knew just I had a vague awareness that anytime they didn't know something they could just google it and they did that.

732
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,136
Speaker 0: I can't imagine the kinds of conversations I would have with strangers.

733
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:21,820
Speaker 1: people.

734
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:22,744
Speaker 1: What about people who?

735
00:46:23,226 --> 00:46:25,335
Speaker 1: it seems like they just don't want to know things.

736
00:46:25,456 --> 00:46:28,065
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like people just have.

737
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,129
Speaker 1: they just do things right?

738
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:30,594
Speaker 1: It's like they watch TV.

739
00:46:31,236 --> 00:46:34,288
Speaker 1: They go to work They get drunk.

740
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,996
Speaker 0: So, how do we go to sleep?

741
00:46:36,237 --> 00:46:43,170
Speaker 1: They eat food They don't want to know things Hunger for knowledge because we didn't have internet.

742
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,714
Speaker 0: and then we did a group without internet.

743
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:46,560
Speaker 0: and then one day I got access to internet.

744
00:46:46,962 --> 00:47:00,900
Speaker 0: And basically if you chart that my life and what I was doing with different percentages of my time The day I got access to the real internet ice the majority of my time Became that to the exclusion of almost everything else.

745
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:06,790
Speaker 0: Yeah It was like I was walking through the desert and then someone walked over and said Here's a spigot of infinite water.

746
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:11,611
Speaker 0: use it as much as you want for the rest of your life Drinking for the rest of my life mostly so.

747
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:13,760
Speaker 0: then I hand it to other people and they're like what the fuck is this?

748
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:19,367
Speaker 1: I prefer to be thirsty Or maybe they're just not there.

749
00:47:19,387 --> 00:47:21,193
Speaker 1: Yes, they don't need water to live.

750
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:24,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you spray them with it They're like practices.

751
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,298
Speaker 1: They don't need too much water.

752
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:35,630
Speaker 0: So it's the world of of geeks wearing camelbacks that are connected to a giant spigot in the sky and everyone else is a camel Eventually dying alone in the desert after breeding.

753
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:36,333
