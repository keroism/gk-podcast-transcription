1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,949
Speaker 1: It's Thursday April 26th.

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:12,832
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,300
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is big knives.

4
00:00:16,988 --> 00:00:20,398
Speaker 1: tonight Thursday we totally cop out.

5
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:23,758
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,920
Speaker 0: So probably for the past.

7
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:29,764
Speaker 0: I don't know.

8
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:31,049
Speaker 0: let me do some math here.

9
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:36,781
Speaker 0: 20 for 19 years of my life I've carried around stuff with me.

10
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:37,605
Speaker 0: where I went.

11
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:44,494
Speaker 0: you know if I went places I needed to bring shit with me, and I brought that shit in a bag specific style of bag.

12
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:45,717
Speaker 0: the backpack.

13
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:56,470
Speaker 1: see I had one backpack the exact same backpack up until halfway through high school where For various our reasons an apple ended up sitting in the outside pouch until it became powder.

14
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:03,209
Speaker 1: Okay, well it was in there, and I thought and I kept forgetting about it.

15
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,169
Speaker 1: and finally I open it one day, and there's this rotten apple, and it's all there.

16
00:01:06,752 --> 00:01:08,500
Speaker 1: I didn't want it didn't want it didn't want to deal with it.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,250
Speaker 1: I just closed it and Every day that went by it was one day worse to actually deal with it.

18
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,250
Speaker 1: So I never dealt with it, and it turned to dust yeah, and then the backpack was okay.

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,697
Speaker 0: It added water and drank it.

20
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:21,500
Speaker 0: it tastes like apple juice.

21
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:23,510
Speaker 1: That's a great idea alright.

22
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:27,290
Speaker 0: So anyway when I was a kid you know I had probably some cartoon characters.

23
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:37,440
Speaker 0: I don't remember what kind of backpack I had until eventually I got a blue LL bean backpack and I replaced that like four or five years ago with a black LL bean backpack.

24
00:01:37,601 --> 00:01:38,990
Speaker 1: I had a black backpack.

25
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:40,094
Speaker 1: I don't know who made it.

26
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:46,958
Speaker 1: well eventually the apple dust and other incidents forced me to buy a new backpack Which I then used until today, and I still use.

27
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:55,380
Speaker 0: yeah, they I still have the black one by the way, but yeah LL bean is pretty cool because if you get a backpack from them It's got this lifetime warranty.

28
00:01:55,582 --> 00:02:01,434
Speaker 0: so if anything happens to it You just say hey give me a new one and they give you a new one when you send them back the old one It's pretty cool.

29
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:02,839
Speaker 1: You know theoretically.

30
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,950
Speaker 1: I still have the lifetime warranty on that bike that I just got repaired.

31
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:19,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, the thing is the warranty only applies to the lifetime parts Which if I read it closely is only the frame and nothing else and every single other component has been replaced.

32
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:25,830
Speaker 0: pretty much every Bike has the same kind of deal where the frames have super warranties and the other parts don't anyway.

33
00:02:26,373 --> 00:02:27,983
Speaker 0: So I got this laptop recently.

34
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,090
Speaker 0: we talked about it before.

35
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:35,530
Speaker 0: It's really small and I wanted to carry it around and just dumping it in my backpack was not working so well.

36
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:37,839
Speaker 0: But I didn't really want to buy a new bag.

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,750
Speaker 0: because well my backpack didn't feel very old I mean it's still in great condition, but I realized hey this thing's like five or six years old.

38
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,118
Speaker 0: I can totally replace it without worrying about it.

39
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:48,483
Speaker 0: Why shouldn't I replace it?

40
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:49,406
Speaker 0: so I did.

41
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:50,590
Speaker 0: so I went around.

42
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,936
Speaker 0: I tried to find a bag.

43
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:54,910
Speaker 0: you know not necessarily a backpack, but a bag.

44
00:02:55,051 --> 00:03:02,070
Speaker 0: You know the site the messenger bags that are all hip and in cool in the style That would hold a ten point six inch widescreen laptop.

45
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:11,061
Speaker 1: Yes, also not a crappy one because I did buy a messenger bag a little while ago from an outlet store and One of the straps broke immediately.

46
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:15,579
Speaker 0: Wow Immediately that sucks, so I went looking around.

47
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:23,849
Speaker 0: I went to a store in the city that sells just bags and nothing else and Basically I could find plenty where that were close.

48
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:30,330
Speaker 0: But none of them would hold this tiny laptop and efficiently and hold all my other stuff efficiently.

49
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:34,325
Speaker 0: And it just wasn't gonna work out buying a laptop bag, so I said to myself.

50
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:35,349
Speaker 0: I know what to do.

51
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:40,710
Speaker 0: I'll get a laptop sleeve to protect the laptop and then just a normal bag.

52
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,074
Speaker 0: I could just dump the sleeve into it.

53
00:03:42,696 --> 00:03:51,830
Speaker 0: the problem of course was it was just as hard to find a ten point six inch Laptop sleeve as it was to find a bag that supported ten point six inch laptops.

54
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:54,181
Speaker 1: I'm surprised he didn't go with the classic bindle.

55
00:03:54,704 --> 00:04:03,076
Speaker 0: the bindle the bindle Oh, you mean the the hanky on a stick hanky on a stick hanky on a stick is not going to work for a $2,000 laptop.

56
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:09,150
Speaker 1: if you get a good hanky and a good stick Maybe there's a market for upscale landle laptop bindles.

57
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:12,648
Speaker 1: You know you get a nice to titanium alloy stick a geek bindle.

58
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,816
Speaker 0: calm Yeah, it could work.

59
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:18,649
Speaker 1: same kind of people who buy you till a kilts and all that'll probably buy a geek bindle.

60
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:20,961
Speaker 0: Oh that that sounds like a good idea to me.

61
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,630
Speaker 0: Maybe we should go for it anyway.

62
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:28,000
Speaker 0: I finally found a laptop sleeve And it's such a good laptop sleeve that I'm going to recommend it to you.

63
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:35,310
Speaker 0: if you're in the market for a sleeve of some Sort to protect your laptop especially if your laptop is some weird size.

64
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:52,270
Speaker 0: But also if your laptop is a normal size you should go to the website Shinza.com Shinza.com and I'll probably link to this and they sell these zero shock 3 Laptop sleeve and all sorts of sizes including 11 inches which is perfect.

65
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:57,310
Speaker 0: It's like 30 something bucks, and it super protects your laptop on all sides.

66
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,330
Speaker 0: It's got this nice zipper, and it's made out of this foamy stuff, and it's great.

67
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:02,809
Speaker 0: So I got me one of those.

68
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:08,750
Speaker 0: But then I needed a bag and I went looking around at bags, and you know there are some bags that were okay.

69
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,573
Speaker 0: You know there's like.

70
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:14,350
Speaker 0: there's a urban Manhattan something brand that is like made in the city or something.

71
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:26,959
Speaker 0: And there's some other brands that were looking okay like the targets and the whatever's But nothing was really like you know standing out to me because I don't want to have the same bag as like every other Shmuck on the street, so I finally found the answer.

72
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,850
Speaker 0: you might have seen people around who have messenger bags that have a swirly on them.

73
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:32,216
Speaker 0: I've seen them around rim.

74
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:33,000
Speaker 0: you ever seen them around?

75
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,349
Speaker 1: see I never had until you pointed it out And now I notice a few of them.

76
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, see like I would see them around from time to time And I you know it never even occurred to me that the swirly was a brand or anything.

77
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,050
Speaker 0: It's just like I would see messenger bags with swirlies?

78
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:45,633
Speaker 1: I don't know.

79
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:49,050
Speaker 1: I guess I don't spend my time walking around Manhattan and looking at other men's bags.

80
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,050
Speaker 0: I look at all kinds of stuff while I'm standing.

81
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:59,938
Speaker 0: Anyway that swirly is the brand logo of a company called Timbuktu T-I-M-B-U-K the number two.

82
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:09,110
Speaker 0: not to be confused with the mediocre board game by the same name No, and not to be confused with the place in geography, and they make all sorts of crazy bags.

83
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,770
Speaker 1: I like you say the place in geography like it's not a real place, but just a thing you learn about in school.

84
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:15,078
Speaker 0: Well, have you ever been there?

85
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:15,682
Speaker 0: No.

86
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:16,729
Speaker 0: Do you know anyone has been there?

87
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,394
Speaker 0: Possibly so.

88
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:21,242
Speaker 0: it's essentially equivalent to North Dakota except.

89
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:23,790
Speaker 1: I know someone who lived in North Dakota lived.

90
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:27,821
Speaker 0: They say yeah, and on the conspiracy ha ha I see.

91
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:31,010
Speaker 0: so Timbuktu sells all kinds of cool bags.

92
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,489
Speaker 0: But what's especially cool is that if you want a messenger bag?

93
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:37,100
Speaker 0: You know the kind that's all hip it in style.

94
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:39,430
Speaker 0: you can customize it at their website.

95
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:45,387
Speaker 0: It can get pretty expensive But it's worth it if you actually are willing to pay to get exactly what you want.

96
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:48,339
Speaker 1: the bag I gotta say that you got is pretty nice.

97
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:49,724
Speaker 0: It's real nice.

98
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:56,907
Speaker 0: It's made in San Francisco I assume by a combination of hand and machine and you can customize all sorts of stuff.

99
00:06:56,927 --> 00:07:06,580
Speaker 0: you see all their bags Have the same design of three panels of material so it's like three stripes And you can choose the color of each stripe, so you can get one.

100
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,577
Speaker 0: That's like you know black purple red or Green yellow green.

101
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:19,442
Speaker 0: again, I got gray black gray because Everything I'm getting lately seems to be black and silver and such.

102
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:21,530
Speaker 0: so I wanted to make everything match.

103
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:26,130
Speaker 0: And then you can choose the color of the swirly and you can choose what kind of straps you want.

104
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:30,811
Speaker 0: And you can choose what you want on the inside whether you want one compartment or two it can.

105
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:34,944
Speaker 0: you can choose to have a handle or not and you can choose all sorts of stuff.

106
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:42,590
Speaker 0: and I bought this bag and It was kind of annoying because you know I wasn't too sure spending like a hundred bucks on a bag.

107
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:44,256
Speaker 0: You know I might not like the bag.

108
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:45,139
Speaker 0: What am I gonna do?

109
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:46,665
Speaker 0: and since it's a custom bag.

110
00:07:46,986 --> 00:07:49,214
Speaker 0: It's non returnable So it's very.

111
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:54,979
Speaker 0: I was very cautious, and then the bag showed up, and I got the bag and let me tell you It's a good bag.

112
00:07:55,443 --> 00:08:07,990
Speaker 1: It's like oh, man I think the moral and this seems to be the moral in almost every situation you can ever come across in your entire life Is that in almost any time where you have a problem money is always the answer.

113
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,429
Speaker 1: Money will solve your problems for you.

114
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:23,119
Speaker 0: I think the other moral is if you have the choice between buying a mainstream mass manufactured product that's just the same thing a thousand times or Customizing something to your personal needs.

115
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:28,666
Speaker 0: if you can afford to customize something to your personal needs You'll probably be much happier doing so.

116
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:29,933
Speaker 1: yes It's just.

117
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:31,178
Speaker 1: it's like you had.

118
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,809
Speaker 1: it costs X dollars more to get the.

119
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:37,970
Speaker 0: To get the same bag as me at that bag store in the city was like 50 bucks.

120
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:41,822
Speaker 0: I basically paid twice as much in order to get exactly what I wanted.

121
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,029
Speaker 1: That's really not that much money though at all.

122
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:54,157
Speaker 0: Considering this bag is probably gonna be my primary bag of bags for carrying shit around for I don't know at least five years I think that's worth $100.

123
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:58,530
Speaker 1: consider that there was this messenger bag that was made out of leather for sale at some fair.

124
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,201
Speaker 1: I was walking by in the city, and it was $300.

125
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:03,394
Speaker 0: whoa Who the hell would buy that?

126
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:04,980
Speaker 1: I don't know.

127
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:07,710
Speaker 0: the thing is I'm walking around the city with my cool bag.

128
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,510
Speaker 0: That's got all sorts of compartments, and it holds stuff real efficiently, and it's pretty cool.

129
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:18,984
Speaker 0: And I see all these other people walking out with their doofy bags And I'm like hey, I gotta admit my bags pretty doofy, and I hate it.

130
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:20,289
Speaker 1: I hate it hate it hate it.

131
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:21,758
Speaker 1: My backpacks okay, except.

132
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:22,502
Speaker 1: It's kind of broken.

133
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:24,114
Speaker 0: my backpack still okay It's just.

134
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,650
Speaker 0: I got this laptop now So I'm not gonna carry.

135
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:30,206
Speaker 0: I was definitely not gonna carry a separate laptop bag and the backpack.

136
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:30,950
Speaker 0: that wasn't gonna happen.

137
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,902
Speaker 1: But that messenger bag I got now is just not doing it.

138
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:36,696
Speaker 1: riding my bike with that thing is like the worst experience ever.

139
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:41,163
Speaker 0: actually the Timbuktu bag has this Additional feature that it's pretty much.

140
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:43,395
Speaker 0: It's not an additional feature It's a standard feature.

141
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:44,902
Speaker 0: it has this cross strap.

142
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:53,217
Speaker 0: you attach to one of these little rings And you can you know pull it really tight onto your body And it's meant to be ridden Worn while riding the bike.

143
00:09:53,598 --> 00:10:00,524
Speaker 1: now one thing I find interesting a bag like this Would never have been necessary or even an idea.

144
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,410
Speaker 1: I would have thought of in most of my life.

145
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:17,810
Speaker 1: It's only that I live here in New York where I often end up taking trains around in mass transit And I'm usually very far away from my car as opposed to the rest of my life Where no matter where I was my car was always there, so I kept anything I needed in my trunk.

146
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,519
Speaker 1: I have to be more and more able to carry things.

147
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,990
Speaker 1: I need on me on my person at all times, so Basically and Scott's the same way we need purses now as opposed to just cars.

148
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:33,348
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean it used to be that I would just carry a wallet wherever I went and maybe a key.

149
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,748
Speaker 0: yeah And a cell phone was added and then a laptop was Ed.

150
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:42,683
Speaker 1: once I hit the once I got a trench coat and I became One of those guys who wears the trench coat.

151
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:51,202
Speaker 1: way back in high school I started carrying everything I needed in the trench coat which was great in the winter And really sucked in the summer because I didn't have anywhere to put all that stuff.

152
00:10:51,262 --> 00:10:59,998
Speaker 0: actually before the laptop was added the iPod was added and the digital camera was a. And you know the train ticket, and it just gets out of control.

153
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:00,940
Speaker 0: you need a murse.

154
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,154
Speaker 1: Well it helped that when I was a kid I didn't need to carry around.

155
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:14,430
Speaker 1: you know a bunch of credit cards and a bunch of health insurance cards and my metro card And my train tickets and my work ID and all the IDs for the other jobs.

156
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:25,355
Speaker 0: And a DS needs to be carried around - oh yeah, I can't everywhere I go which is probably why I broke my first DS and DS games and It's just too much stuff.

157
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:26,198
Speaker 0: and this bag.

158
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:26,900
Speaker 0: it does the trick.

159
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:36,180
Speaker 0: so if you are someone who needs a bag to carry your shit around with and You got some money to spend Tim buk - calm it's.

160
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:43,910
Speaker 0: if the bag is made in San Francisco 100% It's a little bit expensive But you can customize it to be exactly right for your lifestyle.

161
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,619
Speaker 1: It gives me the same feeling that that Jimmy wallet gives me.

162
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,335
Speaker 1: it does give me domestically produced by non slave labor Company seems pretty cool.

163
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:54,245
Speaker 1: They make a great product, and it's the exact right price.

164
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:54,687
Speaker 0: Well.

165
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:55,690
Speaker 0: It's not the exact right price.

166
00:11:55,751 --> 00:12:00,481
Speaker 0: I would have much rather paid the $50 I mean if this thing had anything disappointing about it.

167
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:05,378
Speaker 0: I would have been very upset because like it was non returnable Yeah, but they do guarantee the quality.

168
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:10,235
Speaker 0: so like if it was broken like say the strap was ripped in half when it came They would have fixed that for me.

169
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:13,650
Speaker 1: I'm probably gonna get a similar bag once I get a laptop.

170
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:20,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing was is these are the only people actually who would sell a size of the bag small enough like that was.

171
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,542
Speaker 0: my Goal was to get the smallest bag possible.

172
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:25,170
Speaker 0: that would still hold on my shit.

173
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:29,102
Speaker 0: It's like the medium sized bag that they make is way big.

174
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:29,704
Speaker 0: It's like 18 point 75 inches.

175
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:30,186
Speaker 0: see my problem.

176
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,661
Speaker 1: I usually carry a pair of clothes with me.

177
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,169
Speaker 1: now because I take I bike to work.

178
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:37,710
Speaker 1: Well, I bike to the train station, and then I change at work.

179
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,949
Speaker 1: There's a shower and everything there.

180
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:45,910
Speaker 1: Cuz I forgot woke up late one day, and I just put on my normal business clothes And I went to work and no big deal.

181
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,433
Speaker 1: I'm riding my bike ride my bike and Maybe it's just cuz.

182
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:50,565
Speaker 1: I haven't ridden my bike a lot since it was broken now.

183
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:51,410
Speaker 1: It's finally repaired.

184
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:57,370
Speaker 1: I forgot that riding any bike will basically tattoo the inside of your right leg with grease.

185
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:58,895
Speaker 0: That's what it does.

186
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:02,265
Speaker 1: so I tattooed and tore one of my dress parents.

187
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:03,770
Speaker 0: That's what happens.

188
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,161
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's happened to me quite a few times.

189
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:13,204
Speaker 1: Yeah granted when I was a kid I pretty much had a permanent grease slash scar stain on the inside of my.

190
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,916
Speaker 0: that's why they make those little strings that you can Like tie your pants.

191
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:21,841
Speaker 0: You know I'm talking about on my leg But I'm saying you know for the the torn dress pants.

192
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,490
Speaker 0: They make the little string you can tie your pants close to your legs.

193
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:33,516
Speaker 1: Yeah I much prefer just putting on shorts riding to work wearing shorts on the train getting to work put my stupid business pants on taking Them off at 4 getting back on the train.

194
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:40,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right you keep doing that yeah, but yeah They make bags ranging from extra small to extra large, and I got enough about the bed.

195
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,724
Speaker 1: We talked for like 13 and a half minutes about your stupid bag.

196
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:45,774
Speaker 0: I know cuz it's such a great bag I can't stop talking.

197
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:47,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to talk about something more important.

198
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:49,129
Speaker 1: all right build my new computer, right?

199
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:52,440
Speaker 1: The forums and found the perfect motherboard.

200
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,203
Speaker 1: everything was set.

201
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:56,636
Speaker 1: I was gonna come home today Cuz I can't get to Newegg from work.

202
00:13:56,957 --> 00:14:00,047
Speaker 1: click buy and just wait for my new computer to come.

203
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:04,769
Speaker 1: but today Mana that clock never rings.

204
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:06,556
Speaker 0: So I almost rang.

205
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:21,982
Speaker 1: almost so I'm poking around on the Ubuntu forums Ubuntu and the Gentoo forums and I start noticing that people don't have a lot of great things to say about that motherboard in Linux and that Several of its key functions seem to have a lot of problems.

206
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:27,847
Speaker 1: and these posts were from a couple months ago And I didn't see any resolution really and I started getting leery.

207
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,416
Speaker 0: yeah Well see there's a big problem in that.

208
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:34,670
Speaker 0: recently motherboards have done a few cool things that have caused trouble.

209
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:38,150
Speaker 0: First they've made onboard sound cards that don't suck.

210
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:44,410
Speaker 0: That's good because now you don't have to go out and spend extra money on a sound card And that somehow didn't increase the price of motherboards.

211
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,790
Speaker 0: So it's like everyone gets a free sound card doesn't suck.

212
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:51,069
Speaker 1: The bad part is many of those sound cards work poorly if at all in Linux Yep.

213
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:58,698
Speaker 0: Secondly the people have started adding lots of SAT a ports and raid and all sorts of other Awesome storage features.

214
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:01,230
Speaker 1: the AV 9 has 10 serially ATAs.

215
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:08,810
Speaker 0: I was so excited about that motherboard 10 serial ATA connectors three different serial ATA controllers to handle all those connectors.

216
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:13,824
Speaker 0: But of course all these different you know controllers that handle these connectors.

217
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:15,870
Speaker 0: some of them work better than others in Linux.

218
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,870
Speaker 0: You know some work perfectly some don't work at all some work, but have problems.

219
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:22,520
Speaker 0: It's really not so hot.

220
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:27,650
Speaker 1: so I think Despite the fact that I really wanted to go straight up and tell all the way.

221
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:36,924
Speaker 1: I'm probably gonna have to buy an n-force board which I used to love n-force, but now all the new n-forces They're all SLI so they all cost a lot more money than they need to.

222
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:38,710
Speaker 0: yeah, this is what's doubly annoying right?

223
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,252
Speaker 0: Oh, I forgot.

224
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:46,489
Speaker 0: also network cards are starting to be built into motherboards which isn't a big deal because network cards cost like 10 bucks, but it does save you a slot.

225
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,523
Speaker 0: and The thing is some network cards work in Linux and some don't.

226
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:51,768
Speaker 1: luckily most of them do.

227
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,979
Speaker 0: yeah But it's like when you had when you couldn't get one on your motherboard And you would go and buy one separately.

228
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,775
Speaker 0: you would just always buy one that worked in Linux And it wouldn't matter what motherboard you got.

229
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:02,160
Speaker 0: you weren't restricted in any way.

230
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:04,527
Speaker 1: so so the moral is.

231
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:08,963
Speaker 1: now I'm looking at motherboards all right the SLI home and SLI.

232
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:11,090
Speaker 1: I don't want but every motherboard has it.

233
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:17,850
Speaker 0: That's what's annoying is that Nvidia is really pushing this SLI because they want everyone to buy two video cards with two Nvidia chips.

234
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,819
Speaker 0: They make more money, but every benchmark.

235
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,150
Speaker 1: I read shows that SLI gets marginal performance.

236
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:35,147
Speaker 0: It would be one thing if SLI actually was almost like twice as fast as one video card like if it was 175 percent the speed of you know what the video card that you chose to get to of.

237
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:37,016
Speaker 0: that would be alright But it's not.

238
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:51,040
Speaker 0: it's like a hundred and twenty five percent and in some cases It's actually slower if you have two video cards than if you have one and every n-force chipset works really well in Linux, but Every motherboard that has an Nvidia chipset also has SLI.

239
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:52,505
Speaker 1: no big deal except.

240
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:53,930
Speaker 1: They're all expensive as a result.

241
00:16:54,172 --> 00:17:06,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like you got to pay $200 for a motherboard that you're only going to use a hundred and ten dollars worth of Just to get the chipset that works in Linux because the other ones don't work, so here's the worst thing.

242
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:14,884
Speaker 1: This is perhaps the nail through my palms The motherboard that is the best price per all the features it has.

243
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:16,650
Speaker 1: that supports everything I want.

244
00:17:17,372 --> 00:17:21,045
Speaker 1: It's not other than the goddamn a bit fatality motherboard.

245
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:25,369
Speaker 0: for anyone who doesn't know Fatality is like a famous FPS playing guy.

246
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,569
Speaker 0: I don't know if he's technically still the best in the world, but he's definitely the most famous.

247
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,857
Speaker 1: He's one of the best FPSers ever to live.

248
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:34,850
Speaker 1: yeah pretty much other than perhaps Dan Greer who for some reason never really competed.

249
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:38,444
Speaker 0: You know he should have so and fatality is this famous guy.

250
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,881
Speaker 0: forget his name, but if you told it to me I'd say that's the one.

251
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:47,869
Speaker 0: but He has a licensing deal with a bit where they put his name on the motherboards in order to sell them to gamers.

252
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:49,535
Speaker 1: now That's a bullshit gimmick.

253
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:51,483
Speaker 1: It's garbage however.

254
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:53,450
Speaker 1: This motherboard is not that bad.

255
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,989
Speaker 0: It's like I would be ashamed to buy a motherboard with this kid's name on it.

256
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,833
Speaker 1: You know what it's like.

257
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:06,890
Speaker 1: it's like if when you're a kid right back when the Air Jordans were like 90 bucks Or you can get it out of 200 bucks Or you could get a very good day to get a pair of kids for like 10 bucks.

258
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:15,030
Speaker 1: It's like if suddenly the Air Jordans were less than the kids And you don't want to buy them because you're buying into that bullshit branding.

259
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:20,590
Speaker 1: But at the same time it's a good shoe, and it's cheaper now than the nominally cheap shoe.

260
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:28,068
Speaker 0: I will tell you I never owned them But I am a hundred percent sure the original Air Jordan is an excellent shoe perhaps one of the best shoes ever.

261
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:30,698
Speaker 1: it was Because I did in fact own a pair however.

262
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,590
Speaker 1: I got them on a discount because I bought the previous year's model.

263
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,368
Speaker 1: How unfashionable could rim be?

264
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:43,789
Speaker 0: Actually if you go on eBay and try to look for like old Air Jordans that are still in one piece They go for quite a bit of money.

265
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:45,861
Speaker 1: Really yes like a lot.

266
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:46,605
Speaker 1: well unluckily.

267
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:47,269
Speaker 1: I wore mine out.

268
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:56,030
Speaker 0: Yep, I knew a guy who still had his old Air Jordans from when he was a kid Hey, and he sold them for he didn't sell them, but he kept wearing them all the time.

269
00:18:57,731 --> 00:19:02,626
Speaker 1: So anyway in the news, and I'll be quick about this Fark has changed.

270
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:04,090
Speaker 1: Fark looks different.

271
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,860
Speaker 1: That is all also.

272
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,066
Speaker 0: There's some other news about that.

273
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:13,210
Speaker 0: actually Farks policy on copyright now hasn't changed in many years, but it still sucks.

274
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:18,583
Speaker 1: Here's the thing and luckily the the people in charge of Fark talked about it almost right away.

275
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:24,009
Speaker 1: when because people notice suddenly that hey Fark claims copyright on anything I post it's like.

276
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:29,670
Speaker 0: well It's like they changed the website so now people could actually navigate and find the page that said that it says it at the bottom.

277
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:30,774
Speaker 1: It's always said it.

278
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:35,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was so hard to miss the terms of service on Fark.

279
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,061
Speaker 1: You'd have to be an idiot to not see them.

280
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:39,915
Speaker 1: I've known about them for as long as I've used far I've never looked at them.

281
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:48,309
Speaker 1: so here's the deal the skinny from Drew Curtis And I trust the dude because this guy has never done anyone wrong as far as I can see.

282
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:59,670
Speaker 1: He basically said that the language is such as it is so that one and well This is me reading between the lines the radio stations around America like to rip Fark off all the time.

283
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:07,983
Speaker 1: If you've listened to any wacky wacky waving morning show where they talk about the crazy jungle blah blah blah They're pretty much just reading Fark.

284
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:16,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember I listened to this one morning show in Rochester a few times and all they did was it didn't seem like the actual radio host.

285
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,478
Speaker 0: Guy knew about Fark or what it was or anything.

286
00:20:19,538 --> 00:20:24,174
Speaker 0: it seemed like there was a producer somewhere who would get stories off Fark and Feed them to him.

287
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:29,759
Speaker 0: and of course people who listen to the radio in the morning Aren't Fark readers 90% of the time.

288
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:39,050
Speaker 0: so they hear these incredibly hilarious news stories And they go OMG this news this guy in the radio so hilarious When really he's just a guy reading Fark to you because you're too inept.

289
00:20:39,311 --> 00:20:41,897
Speaker 1: And it wasn't just finding the stories on Fark.

290
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:49,559
Speaker 1: these DJs would often read the headlines like they were their own or actually read through The comments and make jokes that people on Fark made.

291
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,763
Speaker 0: that's what they would do.

292
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:53,794
Speaker 1: also a lot of websites would rip off Fark Photoshops all the time.

293
00:20:54,336 --> 00:21:03,162
Speaker 1: so the real purpose of this is so that when other websites or Newspapers or radio or whatever rip off from Fark Fark can sue them.

294
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:05,227
Speaker 0: has Fark actually sued anyone?

295
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:11,306
Speaker 1: Fark has gone after people Several times, I don't know if they've actually sued But they have written angry letters and sent cease and desist.

296
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:18,098
Speaker 0: if I was Fark I would just make a forum cease and desist and send it to every single Morning zoo radio show in the entire country.

297
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,024
Speaker 1: I wouldn't send one to Howard Stern.

298
00:21:20,305 --> 00:21:26,669
Speaker 1: no because he actually Whatever your feelings are on the guy the man's smart, and he doesn't just rip off a Fark.

299
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,660
Speaker 0: no He does not rip off a Fark however.

300
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,570
Speaker 1: I don't actually listen to Howard Stern.

301
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,694
Speaker 0: I know about him.

302
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:40,590
Speaker 0: the only time I ever listen to Howard Stern was I think when I was driving around trying to listen to My iPod with an FM transmitter and some guys serious satellite radio overpowered me.

303
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,489
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean like what happened to me every single goddamn day until I took the antenna off my car.

304
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:52,606
Speaker 1: Yep, see Howard Stern is like Larry Flynn don't like the guy don't really like what he does But I respect everything he stands for.

305
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:57,486
Speaker 1: yeah That's pretty much what it is because all he stands for is freedom to do what I want freedom of speech.

306
00:21:57,586 --> 00:22:00,759
Speaker 0: the FCC is bullshit Yeah, and his radio voice is pretty good.

307
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:03,150
Speaker 1: Howard Stern has one of the best radio voices ever.

308
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,843
Speaker 0: That's because he's pretty much the most professional radio guy there ever was.

309
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:10,709
Speaker 1: if I had a few thousand dollars I can make Scott and I sound a lot like that.

310
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:16,570
Speaker 1: I think we also need a giant vocal cords like now because you can do a lot of that in post-production.

311
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:18,999
Speaker 0: Yes, no, I can't anyway.

312
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,544
Speaker 1: yeah part of the key is to talk.

313
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:30,321
Speaker 1: really close the microphone But then you got to do all sorts of stuff riddle clip and my voice is definitely not suited to it without a whole bunch Of other post-production, so let's go get away from that.

314
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:31,765
Speaker 0: get back towards the geek news here.

315
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,350
Speaker 1: all right well far change.

316
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,192
Speaker 1: That is all.

317
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:36,357
Speaker 0: yep Ken kutaragi.

318
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:38,603
Speaker 0: if you don't know who Ken kutaragi is you should.

319
00:22:38,843 --> 00:22:40,989
Speaker 0: he's basically the father of the Playstation.

320
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:46,190
Speaker 0: if you Consider Miyamoto and Iwata and those people to be the fathers of Nintendo.

321
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:48,965
Speaker 0: Ken kutaragi is the father of the Playstation.

322
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:56,530
Speaker 0: if you like Playstation games Playstation 1 Playstation 2 if you care about gaming at all you should know about this guy.

323
00:22:56,711 --> 00:23:03,701
Speaker 0: he is very very important and He's really important, but today something crazy happened.

324
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:04,363
Speaker 0: No.

325
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:07,410
Speaker 0: He didn't die he quit slash resigned.

326
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:11,181
Speaker 0: Slash was forced to resign slash retired now.

327
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:19,689
Speaker 1: is this because he's old and wants to retire Or is this because of issues that may have arisen in Sony's current fiscal situation?

328
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:21,694
Speaker 0: yes I am not quite sure.

329
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:27,849
Speaker 0: basically the obvious conclusion to jump to is oh the ps3 sucked so he was forced to quit.

330
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:28,169
Speaker 0: oh.

331
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:38,250
Speaker 0: But there are many analysts who know a lot more about like behind the scenes game business than we do and they're saying such things as well.

332
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:40,861
Speaker 0: Sony doesn't really need a visionary right now.

333
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:51,488
Speaker 0: They just need someone to get the job done and So they're gonna switch up to someone who's good at just making a lot of stuff and getting stuff out on the shelves real Fast making license plates yep.

334
00:23:52,350 --> 00:24:01,893
Speaker 0: There's also some other talk like ah well You know sure he's gonna quit and let someone else do the job so he can spend more time thinking about stuff and be more Advisory.

335
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:12,490
Speaker 0: so I have linked here to an article that contains many for more professional opinions than ours And you can read about it and make your own conclusion because there's not much said about it anywhere.

336
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:28,100
Speaker 0: It's sort of that's why I said we don't even know if he retired or quit or what because no one's talking so much At ABC pricked me with an AIDS infected needle.

337
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,289
Speaker 0: Good luck with all that.

338
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,640
Speaker 1: I can't believe I never made this a thing of the day.

339
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:39,242
Speaker 1: This is one of those old classic things that you probably should have seen it, but just in case you didn't here It is.

340
00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:55,560
Speaker 1: you see Seinfeld ended and as a goof They got Seinfeld and the cast from Oz and they made us kind of mini episode trailer of what it would be like if Jerry Seinfeld were in the Oswald maximum-security penitentiary and let me tell you it's pretty terrific.

341
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:56,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never.

342
00:24:57,146 --> 00:25:00,640
Speaker 0: I watch Seinfeld a lot obviously, but I never really watched this Oz show.

343
00:25:00,821 --> 00:25:06,278
Speaker 0: I knew is it was a show about a terrible prison with lots of rape going on.

344
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,379
Speaker 1: actually It's a really good show and I've seen most of it.

345
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:13,383
Speaker 1: It's actually in the Netflix queue because I never saw how it ends Aha.

346
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:21,440
Speaker 0: Well if you like prisons and rape and good TV shows You should probably get it from your Netflix or buy the sets or whatever.

347
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,640
Speaker 1: You should probably in fact watch all of Seinfeld and all of Oz.

348
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:31,614
Speaker 0: Anyway, when you combine these two things It doesn't really matter if you actually know anything about Oz or Seinfeld.

349
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:35,047
Speaker 0: of course, it helps it makes it funnier But it's pretty funny.

350
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,793
Speaker 1: I will give you one little hint.

351
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:40,124
Speaker 1: the guy who asks Seinfeld Are you a Hebrew?

352
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:46,280
Speaker 1: He is basically the skinhead Nazi leader of the Aryan skinhead Nazis in the prison.

353
00:25:47,441 --> 00:26:00,915
Speaker 1: That is why there there are numerous instances where they talk about him nailing someone up somewhere or well He asks Jerry if he's a Jew and Jerry's like, yeah But people are okay with that.

354
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:04,928
Speaker 1: in a national The best part is the one guy.

355
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:10,140
Speaker 1: you'll know which guy he pulls off an absolutely flawless George Costanza.

356
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:13,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, well if you haven't seen Seinfeld you won't know who it is.

357
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:14,155
Speaker 0: doesn't matter.

358
00:26:14,175 --> 00:26:16,788
Speaker 1: if you've seen any Seinfeld You'll know which guy I'm talking about.

359
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:18,840
Speaker 1: It's beautiful like props to that actor.

360
00:26:19,282 --> 00:26:20,167
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

361
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,984
Speaker 0: it's generally funny when you combine two things Especially when it's not it.

362
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:28,720
Speaker 0: this isn't like a combination done by like some guys cutting and pasting these two shows together.

363
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:32,499
Speaker 0: This is Seinfeld and the guys from Oz actually got together and did this.

364
00:26:32,821 --> 00:26:45,740
Speaker 1: I gotta admit I would have been very intimidated to be on that set with those people because seeing that show Having seen Oz it is very hard to convince myself that those are not those people and that they are actors.

365
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:48,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean when you're acting like a scary dude.

366
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,736
Speaker 1: Adam Eazy is a scary motherfucker.

367
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,327
Speaker 0: in real life He's just some guy who'd be like hey, how you doing?

368
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,397
Speaker 1: Except of course that hat.

369
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,747
Speaker 1: and to this day How the hell does that hat stick to his head?

370
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:02,944
Speaker 0: I don't know what Adam Eazy looks like so a Gigantic black dude.

371
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:08,160
Speaker 1: He's he's the most evil dude ever and he's just in this pretty pricked people with AIDS infected needles.

372
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,245
Speaker 0: I imagine he's a bad dude.

373
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:11,294
Speaker 1: It's probably one of the tamest things he's ever done.

374
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:19,558
Speaker 0: Whoa When you stab someone with an AIDS infected sword So he has this stupid little hat that's kind of stinks someone with an Ebola infected gun.

375
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:24,600
Speaker 1: that kind of Sticks on the side of his head and it doesn't fall off and it just sticks there.

376
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,785
Speaker 0: It's always stuck there with glue.

377
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:26,869
Speaker 1: It's hilarious.

378
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,713
Speaker 0: It's part of his head.

379
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:29,460
Speaker 0: He's actually got all like a big lump there.

380
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,163
Speaker 0: He's covering it up.

381
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,789
Speaker 1: I would assume he shaves his head.

382
00:27:32,111 --> 00:27:34,380
Speaker 1: He probably leaves hair there and just sticks it to the hair.

383
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:35,425
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good.

384
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:37,073
Speaker 1: So what I would do if I was at a BC.

385
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:37,636
Speaker 0: Yep.

386
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:38,460
Speaker 0: All right.

387
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,911
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is a video.

388
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:42,417
Speaker 0: I saw him dig today cuz.

389
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,699
Speaker 0: well I couldn't think of anything better to show you and I actually watched.

390
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:49,600
Speaker 0: I Expected something completely different from this video than what I got.

391
00:27:50,021 --> 00:27:57,920
Speaker 0: You see the video was like, you know tiger attacks man on elephant and I'm like, okay It's gonna see an elephant stepping on a tiger.

392
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,426
Speaker 0: This is gonna be pretty cool cuz.

393
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:02,920
Speaker 0: Tigers can't really beat elephants unless there's a lot more than one of them.

394
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:12,300
Speaker 1: No but we learned something from this video and what we learned was Just because you're on an elephant does not mean a tiger does not have the ability to kick your ass.

395
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:21,615
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean if I was on an elephant and there was a tiger way down on the ground and my elephant was a big elephant And not say a baby elephant personally before seeing this video.

396
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:22,720
Speaker 0: I would not have been worried.

397
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:23,784
Speaker 0: I would have been like, huh?

398
00:28:24,025 --> 00:28:25,350
Speaker 0: My elephant can beat that tiger.

399
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,466
Speaker 1: not even that I would have thought why would a tiger wouldn't even Attack me.

400
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:29,640
Speaker 1: I'm top of the giant elephant.

401
00:28:30,162 --> 00:28:38,436
Speaker 1: It's kind of like if you're on a deck or on a balcony you feel real safe even late at night in a bad neighborhood But if you're on the ground floor not so safe.

402
00:28:38,878 --> 00:28:49,300
Speaker 0: Yep well this video you'll see a guy riding on an elephant and the cameras sort of behind him and You'll see all this grass everywhere and everyone knows he's in the tall grass.

403
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:58,139
Speaker 0: The tiger is hiding in the tall grass with the Pokemon and of course about a minute into the video the tiger appears and Starts to go at this guy.

404
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:05,044
Speaker 0: I think this guy is some sort of Ranger of some sort because he's got stuff that I think he's using to Get the tiger.

405
00:29:05,104 --> 00:29:06,830
Speaker 0: Maybe I think they're looking for the tiger.

406
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,492
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know.

407
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:08,476
Speaker 0: regardless.

408
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:09,720
Speaker 1: He doesn't appear worried.

409
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:11,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, he doesn't appear worried.

410
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:18,805
Speaker 0: I think he's like a tiger go-getter or some sort of zoologist or something an animal person Scientist.

411
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:21,834
Speaker 0: so this tiger comes running at him and I'm like, oh that tiger.

412
00:29:21,854 --> 00:29:22,917
Speaker 0: He's alright.

413
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:23,700
Speaker 0: What's he gonna do?

414
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,592
Speaker 0: He's gonna like slash the elephant the elephant will bonk him or step on him or something.

415
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:34,350
Speaker 0: The tiger jumps way Way up and then the video cuts out.

416
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,920
Speaker 0: and whoa, you got to see this shit now.

417
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,748
Speaker 1: This is much different from the other tiger attack video on dig right now Which is not what you think it is.

418
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:44,140
Speaker 0: There are two tiger attack videos on dig right now.

419
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,852
Speaker 0: The one I'm talking about is one that's actually a tiger attack.

420
00:29:46,892 --> 00:29:48,278
Speaker 0: The other one is hilarious.

421
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:48,740
Speaker 0: You should watch.

422
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,017
Speaker 0: Let's just link to both of them.

423
00:29:52,664 --> 00:29:54,800
Speaker 0: The other one the other tiger attack video.

424
00:29:55,342 --> 00:30:06,150
Speaker 0: It's a guy in a zoo and there's some tigers behind a fence and one of the Tigers rubs up against the fence and you're thinking Ah, this guy's tiger is gonna knock this fence down and eat this guy or this guy's gonna stupidly pet the tiger.

425
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:11,820
Speaker 1: the tiger is gonna scratch bite him or Maybe another tiger is gonna come or something, but the Tigers really cute.

426
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,060
Speaker 1: He's just kind of rubbing up the fence like aah like cats do and then something happens.

427
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,240
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna spoil but it's hilarious.

428
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:28,986
Speaker 1: All I have to say is I personally witnessed a lion Do a similar thing to a child at a zoo when I was when I was also a child and my whole life I have often thought man.

429
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:31,113
Speaker 1: I hope that that is never me.

430
00:30:31,754 --> 00:30:38,900
Speaker 0: I will guarantee that that is never me 100% cuz I'll never put myself in a situation where they could be me ever.

431
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:41,709
Speaker 1: So it's Thursday and we were gonna.

432
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:45,280
Speaker 1: well see I'm gonna give you a little insight into how we do geek nights here.

433
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,600
Speaker 1: You see we have this calendar that's got set up on our personal front row crew g-man.

434
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:51,000
Speaker 0: Well, we used to not have a calendar.

435
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:59,800
Speaker 0: We used to come up with the show idea the day we did the show and then I said hey this sucks Let's make a calendar and we'll put the show topics on this calendar.

436
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:08,143
Speaker 1: So we've used this for quite some time and Monday Mondays are full Tuesdays are full pretty much forever as our Wednesdays Thursdays.

437
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:13,620
Speaker 1: there was only One more show left and the thing is this is a show that we kept every Thursday.

438
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,960
Speaker 1: We'd think ah and we push it off and make up something else on the spot.

439
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:20,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, and finally we got to today and we didn't have anything like crap.

440
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,764
Speaker 1: We have to do this show.

441
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:29,160
Speaker 1: and then I thought of a show to do and then I just didn't feel like doing it Mainly because we went long in the first half of the show and I got a lot of stories.

442
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:33,764
Speaker 1: I don't want to go long tonight because I got a pack so I can go to toricon tomorrow And

443
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:46,399
Speaker 0: I'm not going to toricon tomorrow or Saturday But I am doing a whole bunch of other crap this weekend and I don't really want to have to you know Waste a whole bunch of time important precious time now thinking of a show.

444
00:31:46,742 --> 00:31:52,549
Speaker 1: So the show we kept avoiding because it didn't seem like it would be funny It would mostly just be informative and serious was about resumes.

445
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,171
Speaker 0: Yeah.

446
00:31:53,351 --> 00:32:05,302
Speaker 0: Okay people write a resume don't make it suck Yeah, make it like a lot of other resumes but don't make it exactly like every other resume and make sure that there's actually good stuff to say about you to put on a Resume.

447
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:09,159
Speaker 0: if you can't think of anything to put on a resume, you probably suck and don't deserve a job.

448
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:15,780
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe maybe if you're just out of college you want to put classes you took you want to put your major your GPA?

449
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,490
Speaker 1: All that stuff unless they suck Yeah, and you definitely want to focus on your skills.

450
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:27,900
Speaker 1: have whole list of things, you know things you're good at names of software You know how to use if you protect if you work for more than a few years.

451
00:32:28,261 --> 00:32:31,292
Speaker 1: List all the companies you've worked for and the things you did for those companies.

452
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:31,895
Speaker 1: Yep.

453
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,430
Speaker 1: Well, that's pretty much it All right, so then we decided all right.

454
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,360
Speaker 1: forget that I just had a flat tire.

455
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,280
Speaker 1: Let's talk about car trouble because we have a lot of car trouble stories over the years.

456
00:32:41,653 --> 00:32:54,257
Speaker 0: Yeah well anyone who lives in the US where public transportation is kind of a and you have to drive to get anywhere as a Car most people have a car and they drive quite frequently perhaps daily or more than daily.

457
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:55,200
Speaker 1: I drive.

458
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:55,923
Speaker 1: Well, I did.

459
00:32:55,943 --> 00:32:58,274
Speaker 1: now I take the train so I don't but I used to drive 500 miles a week.

460
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:04,096
Speaker 0: Yes, I drove quite a bit as well for the period where I was working in the middle of nowhere.

461
00:33:04,217 --> 00:33:10,260
Speaker 0: and well People drive a lot and when you drive a lot, you're gonna have trouble with cars at some point or another.

462
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,687
Speaker 0: They'll break the.

463
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:13,053
Speaker 0: you know, they don't last forever.

464
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:20,950
Speaker 0: There's a lot of moving parts in there there's a lot of different systems with many different points of failure and Sometimes they can cause you a great inconvenience.

465
00:33:21,372 --> 00:33:22,658
Speaker 0: So there's a lot to say about that.

466
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,300
Speaker 1: Yep Well, we've got a bunch of anecdotes that I was gonna go over.

467
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,143
Speaker 1: I just don't feel like it.

468
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:32,916
Speaker 1: but the moral of all of them and I'll tell you this right now the secret to avoiding car Trouble or to getting out of car trouble have money.

469
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:33,539
Speaker 1: That's it.

470
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:37,420
Speaker 1: If you have money You'll do the relevant repairs and your car will last practically forever.

471
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:41,767
Speaker 1: If you have money and your car breaks down It is so easy to fit.

472
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:48,480
Speaker 1: if your car breaks down on the freeway and you're on a trip somewhere You either need to have triple-a or a credit card.

473
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:51,568
Speaker 0: Both of those things are pretty much equal.

474
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:54,296
Speaker 1: and the thing is triple-a won't actually save you.

475
00:33:54,577 --> 00:33:55,560
Speaker 1: they'll fix a little thing.

476
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,190
Speaker 1: They'll fix your busted tire.

477
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,680
Speaker 1: They'll tow you somewhere.

478
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:06,510
Speaker 1: But if your problem is more than I'm out of gas or my tire is flat They're gonna tow you somewhere and then you still need the credit card.

479
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:07,071
Speaker 0: Yep.

480
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,478
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's there's no way out.

481
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:11,487
Speaker 1: You can't fix it on your own.

482
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:14,080
Speaker 1: You can't even move the car on your own on most US freeways.

483
00:34:14,382 --> 00:34:15,900
Speaker 1: You can't even tow it on your own.

484
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,719
Speaker 0: You got even if you were a mechanic and even if you had tools in the trunk.

485
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:23,536
Speaker 0: You're gonna need parts probably if anything serious is broken.

486
00:34:23,558 --> 00:34:24,000
Speaker 0: You're also.

487
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:31,802
Speaker 1: Most repairs you could make on the road may or may not be illegal to continue driving with Yep.

488
00:34:32,023 --> 00:34:32,244
Speaker 0: Yep.

489
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:32,504
Speaker 0: Yep.

490
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:38,949
Speaker 1: It just sucks all around and I've broken down a couple times way back when I was younger Didn't have any money.

491
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:45,232
Speaker 1: Let me tell you Every time I was only saved by the fact that while I didn't have money I knew someone nearby who did.

492
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:46,540
Speaker 1: there is no way out.

493
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:48,585
Speaker 1: If you don't have money You're gonna have to pay to tow.

494
00:34:48,928 --> 00:34:51,300
Speaker 1: you have to pay some stupid amount of money to get the car fixed.

495
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:57,060
Speaker 1: If you can't get it fixed, you're gonna have to pay somehow to get where you're going or to get home.

496
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:03,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what if I was Bill Gates and my car broke down I'll call a cab and leave the car there and not care about it.

497
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:06,259
Speaker 0: Yeah I'd go buy a new car.

498
00:35:06,862 --> 00:35:11,180
Speaker 1: I might hire someone and say you take care of this car fix it up and sell it or whatever.

499
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,004
Speaker 1: I don't care.

500
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:13,611
Speaker 0: I'd sell it to someone right there.

501
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:14,897
Speaker 0: I put a for sale sign and wait.

502
00:35:15,298 --> 00:35:17,320
Speaker 1: Haha I wouldn't wait my time's too valuable.

503
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:21,113
Speaker 1: I'd hire someone to stand there with a for sale sign and the deed.

504
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:23,080
Speaker 0: I'd sell it to the guy with the tow truck.

505
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,486
Speaker 0: I just give it to whatever.

506
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,174
Speaker 0: I'd sell to the cabbie.

507
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:27,620
Speaker 1: I'd give it to a charity right away.

508
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,940
Speaker 1: I'd take the tow truck and say here's the deed give it to a charity.

509
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:31,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, that works too.

510
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:33,857
Speaker 1: Of course, you know, the tow truck guy would give it to the me charity.

511
00:35:33,938 --> 00:35:34,480
Speaker 0: That's fine.

512
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:36,513
Speaker 0: Whatever kids getting used who cares?

513
00:35:36,956 --> 00:35:38,962
Speaker 1: So yeah That's it.

514
00:35:39,022 --> 00:35:43,296
Speaker 1: we had nothing else in the Thursday queue other than we have several shows we could do.

515
00:35:43,336 --> 00:35:44,620
Speaker 1: that have been suggested by listeners.

516
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,553
Speaker 1: However, every one of these requires me not to be lazy Scott not to be lazy.

517
00:35:49,873 --> 00:35:59,300
Speaker 1: us to do some small amount of research Us to not spend 25 minutes doing the first half of the show because otherwise us to not spend 15 minutes thinking about what?

518
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,198
Speaker 0: We're gonna do the show on.

519
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:05,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, also the fact that I'm lazy and tired and I got a pack and I got a bunch of stuff to do tonight.

520
00:36:06,142 --> 00:36:08,531
Speaker 0: So I just want to point out again in the forums.

521
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:10,680
Speaker 0: There is a thread that's been there for a long time.

522
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,004
Speaker 0: This is show reminders.

523
00:36:12,124 --> 00:36:12,686
Speaker 0: It's sticky.

524
00:36:12,746 --> 00:36:13,448
Speaker 0: You can't miss it.

525
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,380
Speaker 0: You should probably put some Thursday show ideas in that thread.

526
00:36:17,661 --> 00:36:19,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we do look there.

527
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:24,240
Speaker 1: We often ignore or put off or do shows later, but we always look there.

528
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:30,803
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean I just looked there right now and I was sitting there and not knowing what to do the show on and I didn't Find anything.

529
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:33,613
Speaker 1: I think the problem with Thursday is that there's no limit.

530
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:35,380
Speaker 1: So it's like it when you're role-playing.

531
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:38,568
Speaker 1: Well, I mean Dungeons & Dragons is a pretty crappy system.

532
00:36:38,608 --> 00:36:51,620
Speaker 1: all things considered it is like really crappy and we use it Only because when role-playing while it is possible It is usually not very fun to role-play in an entirely open environment.

533
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,072
Speaker 0: Yeah, imagine if you were just role-playing with some people right and it was.

534
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:56,095
Speaker 0: there were no rules.

535
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:57,580
Speaker 0: There was no restrictions whatsoever.

536
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,073
Speaker 0: You'd be like, huh?

537
00:36:58,721 --> 00:37:11,560
Speaker 0: I fly off into the something plane that I just made up where my friends I just made up and I we get the ultimate powerful thing I just made up and now such role-playing can work, but it's very difficult to do.

538
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:20,580
Speaker 1: well, you have to have a good group of people and Even then even if you're doing it very well, it often bogs down and becomes unfun because there's no restrictions.

539
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,809
Speaker 1: There's no arbitrary limitations that force you to be creative.

540
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:35,199
Speaker 1: while D&D is a bullshit system and we only use it Because it happens to be a system that everyone we know knows and is very accessible Yes, yes and has lots of dice that are fun.

541
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:42,126
Speaker 1: And we're also and also it's one of the only systems that works very well with the kinds of games we play for now well very well being relative but we

542
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:42,407
Speaker 0: are

543
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:49,860
Speaker 1: as fast as we can learning burning wheel and Hopefully you're going to play many more burning wheel games than we ever will play D&D games in the future.

544
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,070
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about the burning empires - yeah.

545
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:59,231
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm still slowly writing my Napoleonic Wars men on a ship Horatio style burning wheel game.

546
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:00,495
Speaker 1: that's gonna be totally awesome.

547
00:38:00,735 --> 00:38:02,602
Speaker 0: I might buy that burning empires book yeah,

548
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:22,339
Speaker 1: but despite that D&D as crappy as it is is Wonderful in that all it does is provide an arbitrary set of limitations that we can use to focus our role-playing and In getting around and dealing with the arbitrariness and the limitations We often find even greater strengths than we would have on our own.

549
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:24,468
Speaker 1: Monday Tuesday and Wednesday are a lot like that.

550
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:27,119
Speaker 1: We're forced to pick a topic that fits into some mold.

551
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:30,052
Speaker 1: Thursday we could talk about my nuts.

552
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:32,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's talk about your nuts.

553
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,925
Speaker 0: Pistachios are pretty damn good.

554
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:34,588
Speaker 0: Let me tell you.

555
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:35,171
Speaker 1: I don't know.

556
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:36,275
Speaker 1: I'm a big fan of cashews.

557
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:37,963
Speaker 1: I really like Sunflower I could eat.

558
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:40,054
Speaker 1: I got like a half pound of sunflower.

559
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:41,280
Speaker 0: flower seeds aren't nuts.

560
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:44,552
Speaker 1: Alright, I'm being vague anything nutty like that.

561
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,160
Speaker 1: Sunflower seeds are close enough.

562
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,779
Speaker 1: I categorize them as nuts in terms of how they're edible and how I use them you suck.

563
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:59,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're putting food I would put cashews which are also not a nut right aren't they something else too?

564
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,383
Speaker 0: Cashews are nuts.

565
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:05,696
Speaker 1: Well, I do know that cashew the outside of a cashew is poisonous and dangerous.

566
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:07,020
Speaker 0: that is very true.

567
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:07,945
Speaker 1: I know that much.

568
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:16,140
Speaker 1: but peanuts cashews Brazil nuts Almonds sunflower seeds they all fall into the same food category as far as I'm concerned.

569
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:18,737
Speaker 0: Well, they do sell them in the same action of the grocery store.

570
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:22,356
Speaker 0: Yeah But but some flower seeds are still not nuts.

571
00:39:22,397 --> 00:39:27,096
Speaker 1: their seeds My left nut is somewhat but not too terribly larger than my right nut.

572
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:28,260
Speaker 0: my nuts are.

573
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:34,980
Speaker 0: There's probably a difference in size and shape and volume but it's not perceptible with the hands.

574
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:40,190
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of hair on my nuts Partly due to the fact that I've mountain biked most of my life.

575
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:42,300
Speaker 1: There's actually no hair on my inner thigh either.

576
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,125
Speaker 1: It's all been rubbed off.

577
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:51,573
Speaker 0: My inner thighs tend to be lacking a lot of hair But and my nuts don't have as much hair as other parts of my body There's quite a few scraggles here and there.

578
00:39:51,714 --> 00:39:52,720
Speaker 1: I have very few scraggles.

579
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:58,020
Speaker 1: I have a lot of hair above but below on the actual relevant nut bits almost nothing.

580
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,485
Speaker 1: There's like eight hairs on the whole thing.

581
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:02,537
Speaker 0: Oh, there's significantly more than maybe more than eight.

582
00:40:02,597 --> 00:40:03,420
Speaker 1: I better give this a look.

583
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:09,180
Speaker 0: I've got a lot more than eight, but there's still not so many down there compared to the other parts.

584
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:10,322
Speaker 0: All right.

585
00:40:10,342 --> 00:40:12,049
Speaker 0: So now rim is counting his nut hair.

586
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:14,900
Speaker 0: I think he ignites has descended into chaos.

587
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:17,856
Speaker 1: There's only like 50 hairs on my actual nut sack.

588
00:40:18,138 --> 00:40:20,724
Speaker 0: All right That's great.

589
00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:23,320
Speaker 1: See that's what happens when we don't have Thursday ideas.

590
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:26,616
Speaker 1: So you better get cracking out there internets and nut cracking.

591
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:36,620
Speaker 1: granted A lot of the ideas you guys have suggested we are going to do I really like the political debate idea where Scott and I just straight-up sound off on a very specific issue.

592
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:39,370
Speaker 1: But I don't feel like doing that tonight.

593
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:39,972
Speaker 1: I'm tired.

594
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:40,614
Speaker 1: I got stuff to do.

595
00:40:40,694 --> 00:40:42,240
Speaker 0: I hardly ever feel like doing that lately.

596
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:45,652
Speaker 0: I'm just not into the whole Politics arguing thing anymore.

597
00:40:45,672 --> 00:40:46,760
Speaker 0: I'm just so tired of it.

598
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:59,180
Speaker 1: See now this annoys me greatly because I still like to argue about it a lot and Scott like I'll be like Hey, and actually a lot of interesting stuff is going on in the legislative and executive branches of the US government right now.

599
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:10,563
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on I think just just now like Condoleezza Rice basically gave the Congress the finger and said subpoena I'm not testifying Yeah, it's.

600
00:41:10,664 --> 00:41:11,827
Speaker 0: it's basically just.

601
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:16,360
Speaker 0: there's just been so much bullshit for so many years constantly every goddamn day.

602
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,902
Speaker 0: I'm just like.

603
00:41:16,922 --> 00:41:18,085
Speaker 0: that's enough.

604
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:19,209
Speaker 0: I can't.

605
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:21,637
Speaker 0: nothing I do is gonna matter besides voting.

606
00:41:21,717 --> 00:41:22,680
Speaker 1: I don't think of it that way.

607
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:32,575
Speaker 1: I think of it in that it's a fascinating field of study, and I'm interested in it And I like watching how things fold out and I try to learn how things are.

608
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:34,060
Speaker 1: not all things are related on paper.

609
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:39,573
Speaker 1: I mean if you look at the powers of the president of the United States They're actually kind of few and far between.

610
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:50,560
Speaker 1: they're a lot less than you'd expect but yet it feels like the president has crazy amounts of power and It's interesting how how things are on paper versus how things really work, and it's fascinating to me.

611
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,424
Speaker 1: But I've always been interested in politics and he says hey Whatever.

612
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:57,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I like me some political science.

613
00:41:57,841 --> 00:42:01,620
Speaker 0: But you know I just really I'm just worn out, and I don't care anymore.

614
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,118
Speaker 0: Why don't we have and I'm gonna cut you know?

615
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,372
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna worry myself about all this bullshit.

616
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:08,039
Speaker 0: That's just never going to stop.

617
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,316
Speaker 0: Well Scott always concentrate on my geeky stuff that I care about their politics geeks.

618
00:42:12,336 --> 00:42:17,516
Speaker 0: There are a lot of politics I'm talking about my you know my video games and my animes and things lame.

619
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:18,640
Speaker 1: We're geek nights.

620
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,806
Speaker 1: We encompass all of geekdom.

621
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:21,373
Speaker 1: There are a lot of politics geeks out there.

622
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:22,679
Speaker 1: I knew many of them at RIT.

623
00:42:23,021 --> 00:42:26,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know they exist and I just don't care anymore.

624
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:43,455
Speaker 1: in fact one of my favorite classes ever was a Politics and communication which was a seminar of me nine other people and this awesome professor And we basically sat around a roundtable and debated about the Democratic primaries for the entire quarter Uh-huh, and it was fascinating.

625
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:44,219
Speaker 1: I loved the class.

626
00:42:44,942 --> 00:42:46,630
Speaker 0: That doesn't sound too exciting to me.

627
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,614
Speaker 0: It actually really was.

628
00:42:47,695 --> 00:42:48,398
Speaker 1: I learned a lot.

629
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:54,739
Speaker 1: also I think the best part was that it's you know RIT quarters ten weeks right, so there's like nine people in the class.

630
00:42:55,401 --> 00:43:02,922
Speaker 1: Basically every week one member of the class had to teach the entire lesson the entire unit the entire topic sounds like a lazy teacher To me.

631
00:43:02,942 --> 00:43:14,220
Speaker 1: no because the teacher was a hard-ass and basically if you didn't do an awesome job He would step in and provide everything that was needed to make the lesson awesome, and he would then destroy you for being an idiot.

632
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:16,719
Speaker 1: It was actually really cool.

633
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:20,199
Speaker 0: That would be entertaining no matter what that the class was about.

634
00:43:20,259 --> 00:43:22,740
Speaker 0: yeah That's could have been about like fish, and that would have been great.

635
00:43:22,888 --> 00:43:24,124
Speaker 1: Yeah Well it also helped that.

636
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:39,831
Speaker 1: it was a pretty interesting time in politics and we were just coming up on the Democratic primaries and no one knew who was gonna win and the professor was like 60% sure that John Edwards was gonna get the nomination, and he thought that it was gonna be due to so-called NASCAR dads and this whole thing.

637
00:43:39,871 --> 00:43:43,786
Speaker 1: that didn't really pan out But no one thought John Kerry was gonna get it.

638
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:44,749
Speaker 1: not a single person.

639
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:53,717
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's what happens, but that was before Howard Dean and his Yeah, even though that was all BS.

640
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:56,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, oh well well I can tell I'm boring you Scott.

641
00:43:56,848 --> 00:44:02,830
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, why don't we have a fun argument like John Adams politics versus Thomas Jefferson politics?

642
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:08,009
Speaker 0: Because I only know the most general of details the most general.

643
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:10,198
Speaker 1: okay What are the most general if we won't get into it?

644
00:44:10,218 --> 00:44:11,443
Speaker 0: federalist any federalist?

645
00:44:11,724 --> 00:44:13,110
Speaker 1: there's more to it than that States.

646
00:44:13,432 --> 00:44:15,429
Speaker 1: How about we debate Jefferson's Navy a?

647
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,019
Speaker 0: Whole bunch of little boats?

648
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,450
Speaker 0: yeah, I get rid of the pirates.

649
00:44:19,571 --> 00:44:27,322
Speaker 1: I respect Thomas Jefferson But the guy didn't seem to know a lot about naval warfare And he wanted to revamp the US Navy.

650
00:44:27,503 --> 00:44:30,814
Speaker 0: it's sort of like one of those ideas I come up with like well What if we did this?

651
00:44:31,196 --> 00:44:32,260
Speaker 0: we wouldn't wouldn't that work?

652
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,548
Speaker 0: and then someone says no wouldn't work because of this.

653
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:38,302
Speaker 0: only No one says that and you actually try some crazy stupid idea.

654
00:44:38,382 --> 00:44:40,430
Speaker 1: everybody in the world has like eight big boats.

655
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:41,293
Speaker 1: Why don't my?

656
00:44:41,334 --> 00:44:42,900
Speaker 1: why don't I make 20 little boats?

657
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'll work so much better cuz you won't be able to hit him.

658
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:49,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, but they also won't be able to do anything.

659
00:44:54,331 --> 00:45:00,130
Speaker 0: It's like a giant castle like hey instead of having one castle I'll have a thousand spearmen.

660
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,896
Speaker 0: That's not gonna work, man Just catapult you.

661
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:06,565
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah, oh well.

662
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:12,318
Speaker 1: so luckily We spent a good 20 minutes now basically copping out And I think we're gonna end it here.

663
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:13,101
Speaker 1: have a good weekend.

664
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:19,310
Speaker 1: if you're gonna be anywhere in upstate New York check out toricon at the Rochester Institute of Technology on Saturday.

665
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:25,217
Speaker 1: I don't know from when to when but I got a panel about podcasting and internet radio sometime I think six six thirty.

666
00:45:25,237 --> 00:45:27,330
Speaker 1: I got a look at the email before I drive out there.

667
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:35,660
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna be there because I'm gonna stay home, and I'm gonna go to Mars, so if you're in the Poughkeepsie, New York area the mid

668
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,833
Speaker 1: Hudson Valley downstate, New York You can

669
00:45:37,873 --> 00:45:43,070
Speaker 0: go to the Dragon's Den on Saturday And I'll be there at some point and playing awesome board games.

670
00:45:43,211 --> 00:45:48,923
Speaker 0: And then I'm probably gonna go around Buying some pairs of shorts and a new belt to replace my broken belt.

671
00:45:48,944 --> 00:46:03,050
Speaker 1: if you come to toricon and you're super cool There is a decent chance that I'm going to be leading an expedition into the New York or the Rochester subway Because there are several people who missed it the last time and there's still fear that they're gonna seal it up or get rid of It.

672
00:46:03,111 --> 00:46:07,243
Speaker 1: so also there's a professor an unnamed professor who really wants to go.

673
00:46:07,323 --> 00:46:07,845
Speaker 1: apparently.

674
00:46:08,286 --> 00:46:09,570
Speaker 1: so if the police?

675
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:12,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, this would be cool because if the police bother us.

676
00:46:12,861 --> 00:46:17,730
Speaker 1: There's gonna be this old dude along with us Who's a professor at a prestigious University?

677
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:19,991
Speaker 0: Hilarious.

Speaker 1: yeah, what are you kids doing on there?

679
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:23,624
