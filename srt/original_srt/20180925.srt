1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,997
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, September 25th, 2018.

2
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:11,799
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:12,320
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,523
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:16,630
Speaker 1: Tonight, we review Rise of Tribes.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,229
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,219
Speaker 0: Alright, I did something today that I've never done in my whole life.

8
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:31,430
Speaker 1: Oh, that could be any number of things.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,192
Speaker 0: It could be.

10
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:34,320
Speaker 0: I haven't done all the things a person can do.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,559
Speaker 1: Oh, it's too hard for you to have skied.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,163
Speaker 1: Mmm.

13
00:00:36,822 --> 00:00:38,520
Speaker 1: I doubt you experimented sexually.

14
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:39,050
Speaker 1: No.

15
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:40,846
Speaker 1: Because it's work day.

16
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:41,711
Speaker 1: Like, you don't have time for that.

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,100
Speaker 1: So, curious what you did.

18
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:49,840
Speaker 0: So, a few days ago, I noticed in the mirror, my eyeball, at least half of it, was, like, red.

19
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:51,214
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Hmm, that's

20
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:51,638
Speaker 0: interesting.".

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,239
Speaker 1: Uh-oh, pink eye.

22
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,356
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Well, let's hope that goes

23
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:54,639
Speaker 0: away.".

24
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:55,198
Speaker 1: Pink eye.

25
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:03,359
Speaker 0: So then, like, yesterday, this is like, you know, two days later, you know, I thought, like, I didn't look again, right?

26
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:05,245
Speaker 1: Me didn't look again.

27
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,580
Speaker 1: I looked in the mirror at least twice a day.

28
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:08,619
Speaker 0: I didn't think about it again.

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,560
Speaker 1: When I brush my teeth, I see my own eyeballs.

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,440
Speaker 0: I don't know.

31
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,020
Speaker 1: Do you just, like, a verge your gaze every time you go into the bathroom?

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,951
Speaker 0: I don't look that carefully.

33
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,640
Speaker 0: I'm not, like, inspecting.

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,280
Speaker 1: Have, like, a shroud over the mirror?

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,140
Speaker 0: Anyway, my eye was, you know, after it went apple picking, you know, my eye was itching.

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,177
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Uh-oh, I should look at that

37
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:26,439
Speaker 0: eye.".

38
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,980
Speaker 1: That still sounds like pink eye.

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,540
Speaker 0: So I go, I look in the mirror, and, yeah, you know, the eye don't look too good.

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,637
Speaker 0: So, uh, today I'm like, "Hmm, I should go ask a doctor about this

41
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:39,098
Speaker 0: eye.".

42
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,299
Speaker 1: My insurance has a thing where I can basically use an app and call a nurse and be like, "Hey, should I go to a doctor for

43
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:45,460
Speaker 1: this?".

44
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:46,280
Speaker 1: And they'll give me advice.

45
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,300
Speaker 0: Right, so I didn't want to go to a doctor and leave in the rain because I was working from home.

46
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:53,040
Speaker 0: I didn't want to go outside.

47
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,927
Speaker 0: So then I realized, "Hey, wait a minute.

48
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,878
Speaker 0: There's all these, like, 'See a doctor with a webcam'

49
00:01:58,938 --> 00:01:59,259
Speaker 0: things.".

50
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,819
Speaker 1: I'm going to go to the pink eye page on WebMD.

51
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,160
Speaker 0: Because you know that there's all these, uh, you know, you always see that on TV commercials, right?

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,497
Speaker 0: Or at least you did when I watched TV.

53
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,065
Speaker 0: They'd be like, "The future.

54
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:12,612
Speaker 0: See a doctor with a webcam.

55
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,636
Speaker 0: Don't actually go to a

56
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,097
Speaker 0: doctor.".

57
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:16,512
Speaker 0: So I'm like, "Well, is the future today?

58
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:17,378
Speaker 0: Let's fucking find

59
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:17,599
Speaker 0: out.".

60
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,080
Speaker 0: So first, the problem I had was, is I had two choices.

61
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,299
Speaker 0: There was one that was, like, my, like, if I logged into my Works HR site, there was a link to, like, "Teladoc, use

62
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:28,580
Speaker 0: this.".

63
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:29,229
Speaker 1: Oh, Teladoc.

64
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:29,899
Speaker 1: That's the one I get.

65
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,720
Speaker 0: And, but, but, the doctor I go to also has one.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,042
Speaker 0: Oh.

67
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,500
Speaker 0: So I wanted to use the one for the NYU doctor I go to and not the one that was on the insurance page, right?

68
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:44,060
Speaker 0: That way all my records would be in the same.

69
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,838
Speaker 1: Scott, if this story ends with you having pink eye, 'cause pink eye is, quote, "really

70
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:51,580
Speaker 1: contagious.".

71
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:53,607
Speaker 1: Do you have pink eye?

72
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:55,480
Speaker 0: Is that where this is going?

73
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:56,085
Speaker 0: Maybe.

74
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:57,558
Speaker 0: Don't kiss my eye.

75
00:02:59,041 --> 00:02:59,819
Speaker 1: God damn it, Scott.

76
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,845
Speaker 0: You're gonna kiss my eye?

77
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:04,500
Speaker 0: Gonna be a problem unless you, like, lick my eye or something.

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:04,842
Speaker 1: Nope.

79
00:03:04,964 --> 00:03:06,420
Speaker 1: Every surface you touch can spread it.

80
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,720
Speaker 0: I have not touched any surfaces.

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have.

82
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:10,120
Speaker 1: You touched, uh, all that stuff.

83
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:11,577
Speaker 0: I haven't touched you.

84
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:12,558
Speaker 1: You touched my doorknob.

85
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:13,368
Speaker 0: All right.

86
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:14,060
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

87
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,999
Speaker 1: Thanks for the pink eye.

88
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,268
Speaker 1: Sure.

89
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:17,813
Speaker 1: So, so, so, spoilers.

90
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:18,540
Speaker 1: Scott's got pink eye.

91
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,497
Speaker 0: Amanda doesn't have it.

92
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:20,633
Speaker 0: Yeah.

93
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:21,506
Speaker 0: Anyway, uh...

94
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:23,008
Speaker 1: Pepper time.

95
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,160
Speaker 0: The point is, is go open my doctor's app to, like, make this appointment, which you can make in the same day.

96
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,117
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like tele...

97
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:31,287
Speaker 1: Why did you even bother?

98
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,220
Speaker 1: I gave you a diagnosis in six seconds.

99
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:34,900
Speaker 0: It turns out I was accurate.

100
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,994
Speaker 0: It's video, it's like webcam on your phone.

101
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:39,140
Speaker 0: urgent care, right?

102
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,619
Speaker 0: So I go through and it's asking me all the good info.

103
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,880
Speaker 0: It's like I'm updating my insurance and I'm putting in a pharmacy and it's like, it was way good.

104
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:47,560
Speaker 0: And then it's like, yo, warning.

105
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:51,201
Speaker 0: If your insurance doesn't cover this, you're gonna pick $130.

106
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:53,059
Speaker 0: If your insurance does cover it, you'll pay a copay.

107
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:56,540
Speaker 0: So I type in my insurance and they're like, we don't know if your insurance will cover it.

108
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:57,500
Speaker 0: Call this number.

109
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,200
Speaker 0: So I call that number and they're like, we don't know, call your insurance.

110
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,059
Speaker 0: So I call my insurance.

111
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:05,680
Speaker 0: I got someone who was real dumb on customer service and couldn't answer my question, so I hung up.

112
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:10,340
Speaker 0: I had to call my insurance again and get a different person who was slightly more intelligent.

113
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,200
Speaker 0: And they said I would only have to pay the copay, so I hope that's true.

114
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:16,040
Speaker 0: Otherwise I'll call them again angrily.

115
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:19,779
Speaker 0: Uh, but yeah, I scheduled appointment on the phone.

116
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:27,200
Speaker 0: At the appointed time, a doctor appeared on my phone, looked at my eyeball with the camera on my phone.

117
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,040
Speaker 1: And with all that effort said exactly what I just said, you have pink eye.

118
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,540
Speaker 0: Well, they said that I had, it was very helpful.

119
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,419
Speaker 0: They said that it was a, there's a virus in my eye, not a bacteria in my eye.

120
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:37,460
Speaker 1: Oh, all right.

121
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:44,280
Speaker 0: And that I should just put like a warm washcloth on it a few times a day and not go get any medicines or anything.

122
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:50,260
Speaker 0: And also wash my hands a bunch and, uh, don't let anyone lick my eye.

123
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:51,943
Speaker 1: All right.

124
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:54,540
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm, I'm just glad.

125
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,739
Speaker 0: Don't like rub one eye and then rub the other eye with the same hand.

126
00:04:58,605 --> 00:04:59,620
Speaker 1: I feel like that's going to happen.

127
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,259
Speaker 1: I think you touch your eyes more than you realize.

128
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,379
Speaker 0: But I only use left hand and left eye and the right hand on the right eye.

129
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:08,860
Speaker 0: I highly doubt that you ever rub your right eye with your left hand.

130
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,800
Speaker 1: I rub both eyes with the right hand.

131
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:15,199
Speaker 0: I do this right eye, right like this.

132
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,198
Speaker 0: I don't do this.

133
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,199
Speaker 1: How are you capable of doing right eye, right hand, left eye, left hand, but yet you can't use both right and left shift.

134
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,098
Speaker 0: I don't think right shift is, is no use.

135
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,599
Speaker 0: Why would there be a right shift?

136
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,655
Speaker 1: Right shift is used for like 40% of all my shifting.

137
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,858
Speaker 0: I should remove right shift from my keyboard because I never hit it.

138
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,599
Speaker 0: It's probably has zero presses on every keyboard I own.

139
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:37,056
Speaker 0: My oldest ones.

140
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:39,360
Speaker 0: He's left shift for all shifting.

141
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:43,419
Speaker 0: So there's, because we- By adding capital A, the ring finger comes over to the A.

142
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,300
Speaker 1: So aside from Scott having pink eye, the primary, we've done a lot, a lot's happened since we last did the Tuesday show.

143
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,280
Speaker 0: The point is that, you know, the future is here.

144
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,155
Speaker 0: You can actually do webcam doctoring.

145
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:53,699
Speaker 0: It totally works.

146
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,320
Speaker 1: Yeah.

147
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,520
Speaker 0: Don't bother going out, and it took like two minutes.

148
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,820
Speaker 0: No reason to go sit and see if it urgent care.

149
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:06,420
Speaker 1: But I feel like you could have come to the same conclusion with the most minimal of research without contacting any other human being.

150
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm, you know, I'm paying for this fucking insurance.

151
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:11,878
Speaker 1: Ah, true, true.

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,819
Speaker 1: So there is a lot of gaming news because we skipped some shows due to PAX, add a bunch of work stuff and travel, et cetera.

153
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:25,457
Speaker 1: So we're probably going to miss a whole bunch of that gaming news and just focus on the things that happened most recently.

154
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:26,660
Speaker 1: because what do you want?

155
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,127
Speaker 1: It's Geek Nights.

156
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:27,798
Speaker 1: We're not a news show.

157
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,799
Speaker 1: So first things first, you can't avoid this.

158
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:32,999
Speaker 1: It's actually kind of funny how big it's blown up.

159
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,531
Speaker 1: But if you haven't run into Bowsette, I'm shocked.

160
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:39,440
Speaker 1: And now you're going to find out that you have not been on the Internet.

161
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:40,024
Speaker 0: Yeah.

162
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:41,780
Speaker 1: Like there was a trickle.

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,160
Speaker 1: It's like when you're standing next to a wall that's about to collapse and there's like a little bit of rubble falls out of the wall and you look at it like, huh, what is wrong with that wall?

164
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:55,880
Speaker 1: And then like one piece of mortar like pinks out and you're like, huh, what could end on the wall just explodes.

165
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,520
Speaker 1: And that's basically what happened.

166
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:08,440
Speaker 1: As best I can tell, there is a crown that turns, I guess, Toadette into a Princess Peach clone lookalike kind of thing.

167
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:13,620
Speaker 1: And some random dude drew one random comic about that in a funny way.

168
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,340
Speaker 1: And for whatever reason, the perfect storm aligned and everyone's just drawing female Bowser.

169
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,589
Speaker 0: And well, it's Princess Peach.

170
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:23,760
Speaker 0: It's Bowser in Princess Peach mode.

171
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:31,500
Speaker 1: It's Bowser having put on a magic artifact that turns him into a Princess Peach lookalike in some fashion.

172
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,540
Speaker 0: It looks more, you know, you think, oh, well, Bowser turned in with Princess applied wouldn't look like this.

173
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,480
Speaker 0: No, it looks more like Princess Peach got a little bit of Bowser with a shell.

174
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,062
Speaker 1: I don't know.

175
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:46,080
Speaker 1: I think this just looks like Bowser having turned into a hot lady.

176
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:48,359
Speaker 0: It's like 80 percent Peach, 20 percent Bowser.

177
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:49,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's got the horns.

178
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:50,774
Speaker 1: You know what it looks like?

179
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:51,660
Speaker 1: You know in stories?

180
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:52,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the 20 percent.

181
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:01,580
Speaker 1: But in the stories where there's like a shape shifter, but they have a towel or like in Burning Wheel, where a dragon that's in a form of a dwarf, the way you know is that there's always a little bit of smoke coming out.

182
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,397
Speaker 1: I think it's like that.

183
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,279
Speaker 0: Their ass.

184
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:08,080
Speaker 1: No, but that's way funnier.

185
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,437
Speaker 0: You got smoke coming out your ass too.

186
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,840
Speaker 1: But this is expanded already into a Chain Chomp, Princess Chain Chomp.

187
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,720
Speaker 1: Princess Podbros, I think, is literally my favorite.

188
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:27,500
Speaker 1: So I just had to mention it because this is way bigger than I expected to the point that non-gamer-y, non-internet-y people I know have asked me about it.

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,980
Speaker 1: Like this penetrated into the mainstream basics.

190
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:34,960
Speaker 0: I mean, everyone knows about Mario.

191
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,745
Speaker 1: Well, that's it.

192
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:37,019
Speaker 1: Mario's very well known.

193
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,620
Speaker 0: Mario's like Mickey Mouse level.

194
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:39,256
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,620
Speaker 1: So in some other news that's much more like actual news, Telltale Games fired fucking everybody.

196
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,220
Speaker 0: Well, see, when I heard this news, it always feels like I've heard this news before.

197
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,214
Speaker 0: But actually, no, they just laid people off like quite a few times, at least once in the past.

198
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:55,720
Speaker 0: Feels like more than once in the past.

199
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,113
Speaker 0: Yeah.

200
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,420
Speaker 0: And every time it happened, it always seemed sort of obvious.

201
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,720
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, there was a lack of point-and-click adventure games for a long time.

202
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:08,580
Speaker 0: They came back with a new engine for point-and-click adventure games.

203
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:13,800
Speaker 1: And basically a pipeline factory to just crank out point-and-click adventure games based on IP.

204
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,241
Speaker 1: Right.

205
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:18,460
Speaker 0: And a lot like what I heard was the story of Crocs, the shoe, right?

206
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,820
Speaker 0: Is that, you know, the shoes are obviously ugly, supposedly comfortable, useful, whatever.

207
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,100
Speaker 0: But it was originally Crocs were only available in like certain places.

208
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,780
Speaker 0: And then they just sort of mass produced them and sold them fucking everywhere.

209
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:32,540
Speaker 0: And that sort of ruined it, right?

210
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,659
Speaker 0: It's Krispy Kreme donuts.

211
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,040
Speaker 0: You can only get them at these certain places when it's hot now.

212
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,500
Speaker 0: Nope, now you can get them at fucking everywhere.

213
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as soon as you could get a Krispy Kreme anytime you wanted, you realized that they're kind of garbage donuts.

214
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Speaker 0: Because the ones that you ate at the gas station weren't hot now.

215
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,335
Speaker 0: Yep.

216
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,880
Speaker 0: Right, the hot now was like, yes, hot sugar.

217
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:58,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean literally when we drove by Krispy Kreme back before there was only one, like near us, if the hot now sign wasn't on, like, didn't go there.

218
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,380
Speaker 1: No, of course not.

219
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,340
Speaker 1: Like, why would you go there unless that sign was on?

220
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,919
Speaker 0: But if it was on, you pulled up to the window.

221
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:04,600
Speaker 1: Yep, and ate too many donuts.

222
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:05,130
Speaker 0: That's right.

223
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:05,460
Speaker 0: Anyway.

224
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,860
Speaker 0: So this was much a similar situation.

225
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:09,800
Speaker 0: They flooded the market with point-and-click adventures.

226
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,180
Speaker 0: It's like, dude, people had nostalgia for point-and-click adventures a little bit.

227
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:14,979
Speaker 0: And some people did.

228
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,419
Speaker 1: No, there's a lot more to it than that.

229
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,900
Speaker 1: The nostalgia factor is probably the least important part of their success at this point.

230
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,020
Speaker 0: But also those games only have so much, it's like, once you play a few, it's like you sort of get burnt out.

231
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,059
Speaker 0: You don't need to play that many.

232
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,560
Speaker 0: There's no one who's like hooked on and who wants to play them forever.

233
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,687
Speaker 1: There are.

234
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,500
Speaker 0: You underestimate- Not that many.

235
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,900
Speaker 1: You underestimate the primary demographic playing these games.

236
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:41,099
Speaker 1: It is people who are not traditionally gamers who are fans of the intellectual property like Walking Dead.

237
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,460
Speaker 0: No, that is a thing that originally Telltale was capturing the point-and-click adventure market.

238
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,480
Speaker 0: It just so happened that one of their licenses, the most successful, perhaps only successful one, was Walking Dead.

239
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,240
Speaker 0: And that brought on people who weren't into point-and-click adventures, but were into specifically, that was like a separate market that they hit on.

240
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,164
Speaker 0: And that's where most of their money came from.

241
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:10,660
Speaker 0: because the other market of people who care about point-and-click adventures got burnt out, doesn't care, isn't buying that many, isn't that big to begin with, et cetera.

242
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:15,320
Speaker 0: But the real story- But that Walking Dead market was basically keeping the company afloat.

243
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,585
Speaker 1: Well, see, you say that.

244
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,420
Speaker 1: We don't really know because we don't have access to their financials.

245
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,906
Speaker 0: That's what it seems like.

246
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,220
Speaker 0: That is what common sense would suggest.

247
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:28,680
Speaker 1: I think it's a little more subtle than that because I'm pretty sure these games are profitable to make.

248
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:38,640
Speaker 0: Well, also it seems that the company was just horribly mismanaged and they put way too much money into making the games and also mismanaged business in general.

249
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:43,720
Speaker 1: That this is a symptom of just the insane pressures of the video game industry.

250
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:52,900
Speaker 1: And if you haven't heard this phrase, you'll hear people who are mad about games, not gamer gators, but actual real humans who are mad about games, and they'll talk about boom and bust hiring.

251
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:58,120
Speaker 1: This used to be a problem in Hollywood as well, but it's a big problem still in games.

252
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:08,760
Speaker 1: And the idea is that games, much like old Hollywood movies, are big projects that have a very, very long lead time and tons of investment required before you can make your first goddamn dollar.

253
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:09,278
Speaker 0: That's right.

254
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,376
Speaker 1: So you need a system and a way to make those games.

255
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:14,320
Speaker 1: You need the pre-funding.

256
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:27,620
Speaker 1: You need a whole pipeline system such that you're getting funding for your next project while you're finishing the previous project, which there's ways to do that that are reasonably non-toxic in film.

257
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,152
Speaker 1: There is really no way to do this in games right now.

258
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:30,857
Speaker 1: that's sustainable.

259
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:31,320
Speaker 1: that I've seen.

260
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,460
Speaker 1: And on top of that, you only need your employees up until the game is finished.

261
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,360
Speaker 1: Like you hire all these people ostensibly to make the game.

262
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:48,380
Speaker 1: So a lot of game companies will hire a huge number of people to make the game and fire them all the second the game is done.

263
00:12:48,860 --> 00:13:00,720
Speaker 0: This is also the reason you're seeing a lot more games with lots of DLCs, games that are perpetual games that can keep existing either in an esports way or a card game way.

264
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,860
Speaker 1: Nintendo trying to charge for the online service.

265
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,430
Speaker 0: Or an MMO way.

266
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:07,800
Speaker 0: Games that try to have an eternal life.

267
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,960
Speaker 1: Or at least an eternal revenue stream to pay for the upkeep of the game.

268
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:16,220
Speaker 0: As opposed to make a game, release it, you're done.

269
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,961
Speaker 1: Here's an example.

270
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:27,000
Speaker 1: If Overwatch had no loot box monetization whatsoever, it was just a one-time purchase, no DLC, no nothing, then the only way to monetize that game would be the professional scene in esports.

271
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,820
Speaker 1: But instead they can also monetize it by getting people to buy loot boxes.

272
00:13:32,383 --> 00:13:35,340
Speaker 0: Which means people can keep working and patching it and patching it and patching it.

273
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,470
Speaker 0: Whereas otherwise it would have been alright.

274
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,000
Speaker 0: that's the final Overwatch patch, the end.

275
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,719
Speaker 0: Let's go work on something else.

276
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,820
Speaker 1: So why is this such a problem in games and not nearly as big a problem in film and television?

277
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,985
Speaker 0: Well it's a problem in technology for example.

278
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:53,320
Speaker 0: Lots of tech companies hire way too many people when they get all that VC money and then when it doesn't work out.

279
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,340
Speaker 1: That's a little bit different though because they almost expand their infrastructure without actually having an endgame.

280
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:02,139
Speaker 1: I really don't want to lump that into this.

281
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,740
Speaker 1: The reason this doesn't happen in film is because of the unions.

282
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:14,400
Speaker 1: Film is set up to where there's a pipeline for people to work on one project then work on the next project and have some sort of continuity of income.

283
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:17,580
Speaker 1: The games industry has nothing like that.

284
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,380
Speaker 1: Game companies will lay you off the first chance they get, they're desperate to lay you off.

285
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:30,400
Speaker 1: And more importantly because they're running primarily on passion and burnout from the people who are desperate to work in the industry making almost no money.

286
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:44,820
Speaker 1: I mean it's literally not an exaggeration if I tell you that a competent game developer if I hired them would probably make three to four times what they make in games doing less work in almost any other industry.

287
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:50,160
Speaker 0: People take advantage of someone who really wants to work on a video game real bad.

288
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:53,700
Speaker 0: Even though we tell them not to, they do it anyway.

289
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:02,160
Speaker 1: These companies will also have this practice where if they stop hiring, smart people in the company know that something's up.

290
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,440
Speaker 1: So they will keep hiring and literally lie to everyone working for them that everything's fine until suddenly they lay everybody off.

291
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,760
Speaker 1: And this happens time and time and time again.

292
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,194
Speaker 1: So Telltale is cut down to like 20, 25 people.

293
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,044
Speaker 0: They basically got rid of everyone except the bare minimum people.

294
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:29,140
Speaker 0: they need to finish the Walking Dead game so that they can maximize profit on that because that actually must be already a sunk cost into it and it's probably going to return on investment.

295
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,580
Speaker 0: Especially when there's no employees to pay because employees are the number one expense in any business.

296
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:36,100
Speaker 1: Employees are also the number one.

297
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:44,640
Speaker 1: It's weird because games have this problem where they basically just want interchangeable cogs to work the development and the design and the art for the games.

298
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,680
Speaker 1: They hire a lot of contractors for these purposes.

299
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,180
Speaker 1: But because of this lack of investment, they never have continuity.

300
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:58,760
Speaker 1: It's hard to have a game company have the same people working there game after game after game continuing to refine the pipeline with these kinds of practices.

301
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:02,400
Speaker 1: But in healthy industries, you see the opposite.

302
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:10,960
Speaker 1: Like most big companies that actually have a lot of money, it's very telling that good middle management and good engineers are worth more than money.

303
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:20,160
Speaker 1: Like straight up, these companies would rather hire one good engineer no matter how much it costs than have like an extra million dollars in cash sitting in the bank.

304
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:27,960
Speaker 1: So the other thing people have asked, a lot of people who aren't in the US are asking how this happens.

305
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,640
Speaker 1: And that's because in countries like the UK and a lot of Europe, it's actually illegal to fire people in this fashion.

306
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,519
Speaker 1: These people got no severance, no warning, they're just done.

307
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:47,920
Speaker 1: US labor laws are so pathetic that I think they're the primary enabler of the games industry in doing this.

308
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,839
Speaker 1: Because the only other industries that take advantage of people in these specific ways are the other people you brought up.

309
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:58,440
Speaker 1: These VC startups that are just trying to like do whatever their monetization cycle is once and bail.

310
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,360
Speaker 0: If labor laws in the US were actually repaired, it would probably devastate the video games industry.

311
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:14,839
Speaker 1: Oh definitely, I think the majority of game studios, the majority of AA to A studios would disappear and you'd just have indies and the infinite budget triple A's.

312
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,299
Speaker 1: I think you'd have no one else.

313
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:22,800
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's big news that will keep festering because this is going to keep happening.

314
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,819
Speaker 1: I think it's going to keep happening until the laws in the US change.

315
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,800
Speaker 1: Because I don't think the culture of people who want to work in games are going to change.

316
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:37,580
Speaker 1: I really hope that the game workers unions succeed, but I don't know if they'll be able to due to the sheer number of scabs.

317
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,460
Speaker 1: It's a really messy situation with no easy way out.

318
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,603
Speaker 0: Definitely too many scabs.

319
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:47,900
Speaker 0: But maybe with scabs, unlike say the NFL scabs, where people still went to watch football.

320
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:52,359
Speaker 0: If scabs make games, maybe they'll make real shit games.

321
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,760
Speaker 1: Dude, if the NHL had a lockout and scabs played, I would watch every second of those games.

322
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:00,708
Speaker 0: That's what happened when the NFL locked out.

323
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:03,160
Speaker 0: The replacement players, people went to see replacement refs.

324
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,600
Speaker 0: People still went to the games, they complained, but they still went.

325
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,189
Speaker 0: So I wouldn't complain, I'd be into it.

326
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:08,660
Speaker 1: Let's see what fresh hell happens tonight.

327
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:16,260
Speaker 0: The code replacement game developers actually managed to make decent games that didn't just crap out.

328
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:33,680
Speaker 1: I guess the final piece of this puzzle, to give a sort of finance perspective to this, is that most of the people who invest in things, like private equity, like a VC, someone who's going to fund a company, provide that pre-money, they're doing it because they want to get a return better than they can get in the stock market.

329
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,320
Speaker 1: Sustainable companies that are small are not going to provide that return without exploitation, in my personal opinion.

330
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,769
Speaker 0: Because the stock market return is already pretty good.

331
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,980
Speaker 0: To beat that, you have to do something evil.

332
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:53,900
Speaker 1: But that's partly why the indie studios are a little, like, they still have their problems, but they're a little more immune to this little scale.

333
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, because an indie studio, instead of exploiting someone else, it's an indie person exploiting themselves.

334
00:18:58,662 --> 00:18:58,884
Speaker 0: Yup.

335
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:00,920
Speaker 1: But it also means that their primary goal...

336
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,560
Speaker 0: So even though it's wrong, it's somehow not morally wrong if you do it to yourself.

337
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,880
Speaker 1: But at least their primary goals are, put food on the table and make a game.

338
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:17,119
Speaker 0: They're a starving artist, as opposed to, right, working for themselves to try to make the art they believe in, as opposed to starving to make the art someone else believes in.

339
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,883
Speaker 1: Yup.

340
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,580
Speaker 1: The moral of this is, do not starve to make someone else's dream come true.

341
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,309
Speaker 0: Hey, you can starve to make your own dream come true.

342
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:27,140
Speaker 0: If you're going to make someone else's dream come true, don't fucking starve.

343
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,860
Speaker 1: Or, like Les Miserables, you can all just die because there's literally no way to fix anything ever, the end.

344
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,638
Speaker 0: Well, you could just live in the not-fixed place.

345
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,858
Speaker 1: Like, watch his name, the couple running the inn.

346
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:39,200
Speaker 1: Anyway...

347
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,577
Speaker 0: Like us.

348
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,642
Speaker 0: Yeah.

349
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:45,340
Speaker 1: In other news, there's some drama in the pro-magic tour.

350
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:57,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, apparently, you know, I don't have all the details on this because when have I ever paid that much attention to pro-magic, other than knowing it exists and knowing some of the, you know, most basic facts about it.

351
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:19,000
Speaker 0: But what happened is, there's like, the magic world championship was going down, and it's an invitational pro event, and only like 20-something best magic players in the world are invited, and they had to play a lot of fucking magic to become the world champion, and it's in Vegas, and one player, about a month or so before the event, decided that they were not going to go because they mad.

352
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:29,680
Speaker 0: They're mad because the payouts for these pro-magic events have decreased greatly, even though, as of recent, magic itself has grown.

353
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,947
Speaker 0: Magic is bigger than it was a few years ago.

354
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:35,760
Speaker 0: It's been growing for like five or six years, it feels like, right?

355
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,168
Speaker 0: It keeps getting bigger at PAX.

356
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:39,300
Speaker 0: I'm seeing more magic in the game stores.

357
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:48,040
Speaker 0: Magic is definitely on the rise, but it used to be, back in the day, you know, some years ago, you could make a lot of fucking money playing magic.

358
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:53,980
Speaker 0: There are people, like this one Hearthstone streamer, caster guy, Kibler, who's like real famous and has a cute dog.

359
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:02,760
Speaker 0: He's like one of the top magic money-making people ever, and he doesn't play too much magic these days, because it doesn't pay that much.

360
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Speaker 0: Whereas if he's like the caster for a Hearthstone tournament, he's presumably getting paid by Blizzard, right?

361
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,986
Speaker 0: Real cash monies.

362
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,560
Speaker 0: He makes money on Twitch, streaming Hearthstone.

363
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:24,500
Speaker 0: I think Geico pays him to stream the new digital magic arena game sometimes, but he's not playing pro-magic anymore, because I don't think it pays enough for his house and his dog.

364
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:27,804
Speaker 0: But he used to pay more.

365
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:29,007
Speaker 0: He used to do it, right?

366
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:34,660
Speaker 0: Other people used to do it, and now they do it less because they're paying less, and that's one of the main reasons.

367
00:21:35,122 --> 00:21:36,179
Speaker 0: This player, what's his name?

368
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,599
Speaker 1: Oh, Gary Thompson.

369
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:38,422
Speaker 0: Okay.

370
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:45,300
Speaker 0: Decided they're not going to go to the Magic Pro Tour World Championship, even though they were invited.

371
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,000
Speaker 1: But more importantly, they waited until it was too late to replace them.

372
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,721
Speaker 0: Right.

373
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:55,940
Speaker 0: If they had announced a month in advance, "I'm not going," then Wizards would have invited the 20-whatever, the next best player, right?

374
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,918
Speaker 0: By waiting until the last second and actually going to Vegas and then not playing, now Wizards has a sort of black eye.

375
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:03,820
Speaker 0: There's a player missing.

376
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,784
Speaker 0: There's an empty seat.

377
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:08,800
Speaker 0: Someone gets a bye, I presume, because they can't get another player that quickly.

378
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:13,780
Speaker 0: The guy flies someone to Vegas at the last second, which is a great move by that person.

379
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,040
Speaker 0: So now there's this debate where it seems like most of the Magic community is supporting this guy.

380
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:23,640
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, there seems to be some debate in our forum.

381
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,660
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like it's most of the internet Magic community that cares about the Pro Tour.

382
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:28,280
Speaker 0: Right.

383
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,440
Speaker 1: Because the general Magic players doesn't look like they even noticed.

384
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:39,134
Speaker 0: Well, it seems to be some sort of debate about how much people care about the Magic Pro Tour.

385
00:22:39,194 --> 00:22:40,717
Speaker 0: and does WotC care about it?

386
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,867
Speaker 0: Does Hasbro care about it?

387
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:46,398
Speaker 0: Why do they still have it?

388
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,153
Speaker 0: They're obviously spending less money on it than they used to.

389
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:51,498
Speaker 0: What's the benefit of it?

390
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:55,485
Speaker 0: Versus, hey, they do have the Pro Tour.

391
00:22:55,505 --> 00:23:02,540
Speaker 0: They sort of, not necessarily directly tell kids, hey, you can play Magic for a living.

392
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,890
Speaker 0: But it's like, hey, they have events at game stores.

393
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,860
Speaker 0: They try to get people to come to play Magic.

394
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:15,299
Speaker 0: You earn points, which if you earn enough of them, you presumably go to qualifiers where you can qualify and get in.

395
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:21,720
Speaker 1: Well, you earn Pro Points that can be used, I'm quoting this article, to reimburse things like flights, meals, hotel expenses, et cetera.

396
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,080
Speaker 0: Right.

397
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:23,322
Speaker 0: It's like they have this system.

398
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:24,644
Speaker 0: It's a thing.

399
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:35,080
Speaker 0: I guess there's at least some people in the Magic community who are in it because, at least partially to some extent, they believe that if they play hard enough, they can make it to that top level.

400
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:42,160
Speaker 0: And about 30 people or so should be able to, at least with the current system, make money playing Magic.

401
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,028
Speaker 0: The thing is, this guy's top 20-something.

402
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:46,031
Speaker 0: He could be number one.

403
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,736
Speaker 0: Maybe he would have won if he played in the tournament.

404
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:48,900
Speaker 0: Who knows, right?

405
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,059
Speaker 1: Grand Prize is only 100 grand, though.

406
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:57,441
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying, is like, how many, if you're- Last place pays 2,500.

407
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:58,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, 2,500.

408
00:23:58,043 --> 00:23:59,405
Speaker 0: You ain't living on that, right?

409
00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:04,976
Speaker 0: But the thing is, in order to even come in that place, like 20th place that gives you $2,500, you have to play Magic full-time.

410
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,201
Speaker 0: Like, if you're not playing Magic full-time, you're not good enough to make that 2,500.

411
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:19,600
Speaker 1: Now, I would suspect, like, my guess here is that, like, I really think that the average Magic player won't notice or care.

412
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:27,800
Speaker 1: And I suspect that many of the other pros will not care that much either.

413
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,940
Speaker 0: Well, some of them are probably happy to have one less dangerous opponent.

414
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:31,661
Speaker 1: Exactly.

415
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:38,820
Speaker 1: Because this is one of those situations where there's a lot of hobbies where there's some money being thrown around in the top, top tiers.

416
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,224
Speaker 1: And there is a, like, professional or a semi-professional scene.

417
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:57,500
Speaker 1: But a lot of those hobbies, they're really just hobbies where upper-middle-class people with disposable income pay their own expenses and pay themselves effectively to be full-time players because they have that luxury and that freedom of doing so.

418
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:00,480
Speaker 1: And it's sort of just a perk for the people who are really involved in the hobby.

419
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,181
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

420
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:12,040
Speaker 0: But if you look like the other, you know, similar games out there these days, I think, like, you know, definitely more people can play Hearthstone as a living because they're supported also by Twitch streaming and other things.

421
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:18,780
Speaker 0: They also have teams supporting them, and there's a lot more events with more payouts and bigger payouts, right?

422
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,892
Speaker 0: You make a lot of money if you're the Hearthstone world champion.

423
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:23,840
Speaker 0: It's a big cash, right?

424
00:25:24,462 --> 00:25:26,990
Speaker 0: You know, you can make more money pretty much with any big esport.

425
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,440
Speaker 0: You can make more money playing, you know, friggin' LoL than you can playing Magic.

426
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, Magic doesn't really have a sustainable professional...

427
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:35,840
Speaker 0: You make more money playing Counter-Strike than you can playing Magic.

428
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's true.

429
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:37,660
Speaker 0: Right?

430
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:41,028
Speaker 0: So it's kind of like, "Hey, Magic is growing.

431
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:46,279
Speaker 0: There is a competitive scene, but they're really pushing that competitive scene

432
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:46,560
Speaker 0: down.".

433
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:54,015
Speaker 0: I feel like if you're gonna have a competitive scene for your game, you should either A) keep it strictly non-pro.

434
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:56,680
Speaker 0: Like, no cash payouts for anything official, at least.

435
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,285
Speaker 0: Someone else wants to run a tournament with a cash payout, that's on them.

436
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:02,031
Speaker 0: But no official cash payouts in anything.

437
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:05,980
Speaker 0: That way, nobody would be motivated to spend their whole life doing it.

438
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:14,460
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I am really not sympathetic to people who choose to try to live this life without having income from some other source.

439
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:23,971
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, look, there are people who try to become pro tennis players or golfers and they get in, you know, they get a rank and it's like, well, you're not... They're never good enough to make money on it, right?

440
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:25,840
Speaker 0: But they try it anyway because they're idiots.

441
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:28,133
Speaker 1: I feel like it's the same thing here.

442
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:28,940
Speaker 1: Like, I'm not gonna lie.

443
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:35,960
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it's like, well, it's not super idiotic because if you were good enough, you're gonna get paid.

444
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,800
Speaker 0: If you're the 100th best golfer in the world, no one will know who the hell you are, but you're gonna be hella rich.

445
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,813
Speaker 0: You're not gonna be mega rich, but you'll be richer than us.

446
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,380
Speaker 0: You'll have millions, at least.

447
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,988
Speaker 1: But anyone who wants to get into golf can see that structure exists.

448
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:53,700
Speaker 1: Anyone who wants to play Magic professionally can see what structure exists.

449
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,865
Speaker 0: You can see what structure exists, but that's the thing.

450
00:26:55,885 --> 00:27:01,359
Speaker 0: The structure was bigger and has decreased and that's why this player has decided to step out.

451
00:27:01,841 --> 00:27:16,520
Speaker 0: And so I think they should either, if they're gonna decrease it now to the level where only maybe 5 people can play professionally, they should either just cut the cash out or bring it back up to where at least maybe 50 people can play and make a living wage.

452
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:24,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I also just sort of see the cash prizes at this point as just a perk at the upper tier that shouldn't have any bearing on the rest of the scene.

453
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:31,740
Speaker 0: The problem is the cash prizes are in sort of like this vague area where if you're in first place a lot you can actually make a living.

454
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:38,540
Speaker 0: It's like bring it down to the point at which no, even first place doesn't make a living, you should only be doing this part time.

455
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:45,820
Speaker 0: Even a small cash prize is basically okay, but none is still better.

456
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:54,420
Speaker 1: I really cynically believe that within a month or two this will just be forgotten and nothing's gonna change in the Magic scene and most players won't care.

457
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:55,303
Speaker 1: That's my guess.

458
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:56,086
Speaker 0: I might be wrong.

459
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:57,411
Speaker 0: I ain't played Magic since the 90's.

460
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:02,650
Speaker 0: There are a lot more Magic events.

461
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,120
Speaker 0: That's the thing, there's more events with smaller payouts.

462
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,686
Speaker 0: So we'll see what happens at the next event.

463
00:28:08,746 --> 00:28:15,800
Speaker 0: It really depends on those, because there's only really 20 or 30 people who are even at that top level who can sort of do anything.

464
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:26,060
Speaker 1: I don't think more events with smaller payouts will actually be healthier because the biggest barrier to entry for people is one, having time to play the games full time to get good at them.

465
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,463
Speaker 1: This is generally not just Magic.

466
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:31,452
Speaker 1: But also number two, travel ain't cheap.

467
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:35,100
Speaker 1: The fact that we fly to every PAX, most gamers can't do that.

468
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,700
Speaker 0: Well, I would agree with you because that's common sense, but Hearthstone this year added way more events.

469
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,229
Speaker 0: This is basically like a Hearthstone tournament every fucking weekend somewhere.

470
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:49,620
Speaker 0: And there are people who just freaking fly to all these freaking things.

471
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,743
Speaker 1: I think the big difference there is.

472
00:28:52,103 --> 00:29:02,140
Speaker 1: I really have this impression purely anecdotal that the average age of Hearthstone players is older than the average age of Magic players, at least the ones who care about the competitive scene.

473
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,238
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

474
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:06,046
Speaker 1: And I think the demographic is similar to me.

475
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:12,100
Speaker 1: The people who are flying around to those tournaments, if I had to guess, they're mostly middle, upper middle class.

476
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,920
Speaker 0: I don't know how much money they have, but they make all their money from playing Hearthstone.

477
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:26,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, also there is a lot more monetization in the pool because you can monetize video games with streaming in a way that you really can't with card games today.

478
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:36,120
Speaker 0: It's really interesting at least, I don't know about for other e-sport games, and I only talk about Hearthstone a lot because it's the digital card game that I watch and play more than other digital card games.

479
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,580
Speaker 0: I play it once a day for ten minutes.

480
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,980
Speaker 1: The digital card game I play the most is Slay the Spire.

481
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,359
Speaker 0: Right, I play that once a day for ten minutes also.

482
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,691
Speaker 0: But the people who are the top competitors at Hearthstone are not the top streamers.

483
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:54,140
Speaker 0: The top streamers are these people who play silly decks and non-competitive modes and are entertaining.

484
00:29:54,881 --> 00:30:02,557
Speaker 0: And the people who are really, really good at Hearthstone, you only really see, I guess some of them stream, but you mostly see them on the tournament streams.

485
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:03,980
Speaker 0: You don't see them on their own streams.

486
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:13,600
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the streamers I watch are either people who are like the purest masters of their craft or the people who are directly entertaining to me irrespective of what they're doing.

487
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, the greatest masters of the craft at Hearthstone.

488
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,200
Speaker 0: Few of them stream and have lots of viewers.

489
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:27,240
Speaker 1: Well, because when I do my Advance Wars streams, I give a lot of dialogue, but at the same time I only play pretty simple maps in that.

490
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,899
Speaker 0: Because if I'm playing Advance Wars- It takes too fucking long.

491
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,842
Speaker 1: No, for serious.

492
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:32,286
Speaker 1: I take my turns really quick.

493
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:33,689
Speaker 1: I ain't saying shit.

494
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:37,700
Speaker 1: It's just going to be me staring at the screen going click, click, click, click, click, because I'm thinking.

495
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,263
Speaker 0: Anyway, this is going to be interesting.

496
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:44,760
Speaker 0: It has bearing on the future of competitive nerd gaming.

497
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:51,560
Speaker 1: So related, last but not least, this is a little story, but it seems like there's more to it than might appear.

498
00:30:52,260 --> 00:31:02,460
Speaker 1: This little story is that basically a Swiss soccer game, well football if you don't live in the US, was temporarily halted.

499
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:04,380
Speaker 0: So Switzerland were the chocolate and the knives.

500
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,040
Speaker 1: Because the crowd was protesting the fact that esports exists.

501
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:11,325
Speaker 1: So I dug into this a little bit.

502
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:17,420
Speaker 1: They disrupted a football game because they're mad that esports are disrupting football.

503
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,249
Speaker 1: As best I can tell, this is happening all around Europe in small ways.

504
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:30,860
Speaker 1: There's this general undercurrent of anger, specifically at Fortnite and FIFA esports.

505
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:40,756
Speaker 0: The only place I've seen this in the US is actually hockey people who are mad that the young players are playing a lot of Fortnite instead of getting better at hockey.

506
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:48,720
Speaker 0: But I've heard rumblings that even some teams are banning their players and playing Fortnite.

507
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,668
Speaker 0: But it's like, video games have been around for a long time.

508
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,420
Speaker 0: Ten years ago those same hockey players were playing Counter Strike.

509
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,198
Speaker 0: Why is Fortnite suddenly, are there people playing it more than they were playing it?

510
00:31:59,238 --> 00:31:59,660
Speaker 0: I don't know.

511
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,786
Speaker 1: I think it's just because it's pop culture well known.

512
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:06,860
Speaker 1: It's an easy finger point for old Gen Xers and Boomers.

513
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:15,780
Speaker 0: Because they know about it, where it's like, I'm sure hockey players who are my age weren't playing Final Fantasy 7 or whatever.

514
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:20,674
Speaker 1: One of the banners read, and I'm quoting here, "Shyce

515
00:32:20,735 --> 00:32:21,196
Speaker 1: Esports!".

516
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:22,420
Speaker 1: You can guess what that means.

517
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Speaker 1: So, my read of this, after digging around a little bit and asking some people who live in Europe, because a lot of my European co-workers and people I interact with, FIFA is the only thing they care about outside of...

518
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,460
Speaker 0: FIFA is game numero uno in the rest of the world that cares about soccer.

519
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:56,360
Speaker 1: So the people who are mad about Esports in Europe, it seems that they're specifically mad that their kids refuse to play soccer because they'd rather play Fortnite or FIFA.

520
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,419
Speaker 1: They don't want to play actual soccer, they think it's boring.

521
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,896
Speaker 0: So that's the thing that on the one hand, it's like, woah, Fortnite is its own thing, right?

522
00:33:06,157 --> 00:33:07,360
Speaker 0: If you're a kid you're playing that game.

523
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:09,540
Speaker 1: I was a kid, I'd be playing it.

524
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,231
Speaker 0: If you're playing FIFA, that must be because you like soccer.

525
00:33:13,612 --> 00:33:16,040
Speaker 0: You don't play NBA Jam if you don't like basketball.

526
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:17,305
Speaker 1: Ah, but there is a big difference.

527
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:20,420
Speaker 1: In FIFA, you can't press X to pretend you were hurt.

528
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:22,772
Speaker 0: Who knows?

529
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,419
Speaker 0: Have you played FIFA?

530
00:33:23,883 --> 00:33:24,839
Speaker 1: I've never played FIFA.

531
00:33:25,301 --> 00:33:28,190
Speaker 0: How do you know it doesn't have that simulation in it anyway?

532
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,000
Speaker 0: In fact, it probably does in EA Sports.

533
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,480
Speaker 1: Can it hit the buttons if someone comes over with an air duster?

534
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,916
Speaker 0: The EA Sports motto was, "If it's in the game, it's in the

535
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:36,097
Speaker 0: game.".

536
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:44,618
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is, will there be a turnabout where they care about FIFA and then soccer becomes FIFA IRL?

537
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,840
Speaker 0: Because right now, FIFA is virtual soccer.

538
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:54,539
Speaker 0: Will it become where, no, FIFA is the default game and soccer is actually the real life version of FIFA.

539
00:33:56,163 --> 00:34:00,632
Speaker 0: Also, if that happens, will then actual soccer fade?

540
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:04,660
Speaker 0: And if actual soccer fades, then will people care about FIFA?

541
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,239
Speaker 0: People only care about FIFA because they presumably care about soccer.

542
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,520
Speaker 0: If there's no people who care about soccer, will they care about FIFA?

543
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:15,820
Speaker 0: Will FIFA replace soccer and then both die?

544
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,520
Speaker 0: As kids who are then young, don't care about soccer and then don't care about FIFA and just play whatever other game?

545
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:25,880
Speaker 1: And then they'll play Fortnite 2 and gun soccer with cars and robots.

546
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,922
Speaker 0: Who knows, right?

547
00:34:27,322 --> 00:34:34,239
Speaker 0: Will there be a point at which FIFA adds something to the game and then soccer has to then modify itself to match FIFA?

548
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,879
Speaker 1: So, keep an eye on this.

549
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,320
Speaker 0: FIFA the game, not FIFA the organization.

550
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:44,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how this evolves in Europe is a perspective on...

551
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:49,500
Speaker 0: It's actually convenient that the NFL game is called Madden and not just NFL.

552
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:56,560
Speaker 0: How many kids playing Madden know anything about John Madden?

553
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,280
Speaker 0: Do they even know that Madden was a person or anything about him?

554
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:01,179
Speaker 1: I suspect not many.

555
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:04,211
Speaker 0: How many of them have ever seen John Madden?

556
00:35:04,432 --> 00:35:06,020
Speaker 0: Do they know what he sounds like?

557
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,738
Speaker 1: John Madden.

558
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,860
Speaker 0: I watched football when I was a kid, but John Madden was casting the games.

559
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:18,320
Speaker 0: I'm sure people of a generation older than us saw John Madden playing football, coaching, whatever, before he was a caster.

560
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:22,754
Speaker 0: I think kids these days, Madden just means that video game.

561
00:35:22,774 --> 00:35:24,040
Speaker 0: They don't know that that's a person.

562
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:30,419
Speaker 1: I mean, I knew a lot of people who played football games on like the N64 when I was in high school.

563
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,713
Speaker 1: Who did not know the fucking rules to football?

564
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:34,599
Speaker 1: They didn't know.

565
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,160
Speaker 0: Well, if you played 10 yard fight, then you didn't need to know the rules to football.

566
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,999
Speaker 0: If you played Tecmo Bowl, you didn't need to know the rules to football.

567
00:35:42,802 --> 00:35:43,146
Speaker 0: Right.

568
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,220
Speaker 0: Tecmo Bowl a little bit.

569
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,495
Speaker 1: Blitz was the one most people played.

570
00:35:45,515 --> 00:35:45,880
Speaker 1: that I knew.

571
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,560
Speaker 0: You didn't need to know the rules to football for that either.

572
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:48,499
Speaker 1: No, not really.

573
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:49,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

574
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:59,480
Speaker 1: But for all the debates and nuance and everything about esports, this particular issue never really comes up because it's so specific to Europe.

575
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:07,000
Speaker 1: And I think it's actually a very fascinating and interesting perspective that's really important to a global nuanced view of what the future of sport and esports is.

576
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:11,279
Speaker 0: Also, I think we don't have a protest culture of fans in the stands so much.

577
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,333
Speaker 0: True.

578
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,458
Speaker 0: They will boo at someone like John Rocker, but that's about it.

579
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:16,013
Speaker 1: Yup.

580
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:24,841
Speaker 0: So because we don't have that, even if there is a feeling among the fans of some sort of unified... Well, that's it.

581
00:36:24,962 --> 00:36:25,925
Speaker 0: It's the booster clubs.

582
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:30,700
Speaker 1: It's the football booster clubs that are specific like the soccer clubs.

583
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:34,060
Speaker 1: They're the ones who are organizing this weird esports resistance.

584
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:39,140
Speaker 1: And it seems like they're the ones who are mad that their literal children don't want to play football.

585
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, those clubs are basically.

586
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:42,660
Speaker 0: no one young is joining into those, right?

587
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:45,399
Speaker 0: It's a group of old people that's aging and then going to go away.

588
00:36:46,262 --> 00:36:47,960
Speaker 0: Young people aren't getting into those clubs.

589
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,048
Speaker 1: Ah, in the stream.

590
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:50,380
Speaker 1: Someone who's not that much younger than us.

591
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,860
Speaker 1: For me, John Madden equals athlete's foot spokesman.

592
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:53,847
Speaker 1: There you go.

593
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know that.

594
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:56,759
Speaker 0: Anyone know Tommy Lasorda?

595
00:36:58,061 --> 00:36:59,680
Speaker 0: The John Madden of baseball?

596
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:04,380
Speaker 0: What was the product that he always advertised during the prices, right?

597
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,300
Speaker 1: Oh God, fuck if I remember.

598
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,498
Speaker 0: It was one of those nutrition drinks.

599
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:06,836
Speaker 0: Yeah.

600
00:37:08,021 --> 00:37:09,360
Speaker 1: Slim Fast feels right.

601
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,319
Speaker 0: Because he was big and fat?

602
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,736
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

603
00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:20,440
Speaker 1: What do you got for me?

604
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:22,898
Speaker 0: So New York City is a loud place.

605
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,325
Speaker 0: Yup.

606
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,216
Speaker 0: Even if I open my window and there's no sirens or honking horns or anything, people outside my window, you hear a constant...

607
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:33,460
Speaker 1: Yup, there's a dull roar.

608
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:41,900
Speaker 0: Most of that is the combined noise of people's electrical things like air conditioners and whatnot.

609
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,900
Speaker 0: You know, machines on the top of buildings heating and cooling.

610
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,800
Speaker 0: But also just the sound of tires rolling on pavement all adding together.

611
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:49,015
Speaker 0: Yup.

612
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,820
Speaker 1: Also millions of people just walking around.

613
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,295
Speaker 0: Yup.

614
00:37:52,480 --> 00:38:01,880
Speaker 0: Anyway, but occasionally in New York, well frequently, there are very loud noises, usually construction jackhammers, big ass trucks.

615
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,359
Speaker 1: The 7 train.

616
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's mega loud noises.

617
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,059
Speaker 0: So this guy made a cute video.

618
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,680
Speaker 0: He dressed up as a conductor.

619
00:38:08,882 --> 00:38:10,080
Speaker 0: He looks like a conductor.

620
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:16,380
Speaker 0: He gets a little music stand and a tux and a little magic wand and some sheet music or at least a white piece of paper.

621
00:38:16,942 --> 00:38:22,840
Speaker 0: And he sets it up next to some construction and he pretends to conduct the sounds of the construction.

622
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,259
Speaker 0: It's a similar joke to the wizard.

623
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:27,320
Speaker 0: The incredible power.

624
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,478
Speaker 1: It's funnier than it should be and the best part...

625
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:32,600
Speaker 0: It's nice and short.

626
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,240
Speaker 0: This video ends before it stops being funny, which is why it's good.

627
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,779
Speaker 0: I love at the end the construction workers.

628
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,180
Speaker 0: If they dragged it out, then it wouldn't have been good.

629
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,760
Speaker 0: But because it's such a short video, it's like, here's the joke.

630
00:38:42,244 --> 00:38:42,676
Speaker 0: You got it.

631
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:43,559
Speaker 0: Okay, we're done.

632
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,759
Speaker 0: And that's why it's good.

633
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:50,760
Speaker 1: So I've done some escape rooms and I've also played a bunch of escape room tabletop games and reviewed some of those games.

634
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:59,960
Speaker 1: But I noticed a pattern pretty early on, like a very specific one, that pretty much every escape room puzzle comes down to this very simple set of heuristics.

635
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:07,400
Speaker 1: And you can solve the puzzles kind of with brute force just by following this really core set of heuristics.

636
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,119
Speaker 0: Well, part of it is the Scooby Doo factor where the things that are interactable sort of stand out.

637
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:15,160
Speaker 0: And you can just focus on mixing and matching those things together.

638
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:27,360
Speaker 1: But it also comes down to, like, look for a puzzle, figure out the number and type of inputs it requires, and then look for something in the environment that has that number and/or type of outputs.

639
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,600
Speaker 1: And that's the answer.

640
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,020
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, oh, this needs keys.

641
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,460
Speaker 0: Is there anything that outputs keys?

642
00:39:31,867 --> 00:39:32,015
Speaker 0: No.

643
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:33,100
Speaker 0: Oh, there's something.

644
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,860
Speaker 0: It needs colors.

645
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,580
Speaker 0: Where's colors?

646
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:36,600
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a bunch of flasks with colors in them.

647
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,558
Speaker 0: All right, let's, you know.

648
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:37,892
Speaker 1: Yep.

649
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,892
Speaker 1: But even worse...

650
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,200
Speaker 0: Oh, this needs letters.

651
00:39:40,522 --> 00:39:43,160
Speaker 0: This is a weird box that has an input of letters.

652
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,420
Speaker 0: Oh, this needs four numbers to open this.

653
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,780
Speaker 0: Let's find four numbers, everybody.

654
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,740
Speaker 1: So even worse, there's a relatively small number of game designers making escape rooms and escape room adjacent co-op games, like tabletop games.

655
00:39:54,481 --> 00:40:06,480
Speaker 1: And they all kind of use the same design patterns, down to the point that this... So this video is basically the speed running hints for just beating escape rooms guaranteed knowing nothing.

656
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:08,900
Speaker 0: Escape rooms are really just a series of riddles.

657
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,658
Speaker 0: I feel like, you know...

658
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,280
Speaker 1: They're not really riddles, they're puzzles.

659
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,900
Speaker 0: Puzzles, riddles, some combination of the two, right?

660
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,520
Speaker 1: I have yet to find an escape room that I would classify as a riddle.

661
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,819
Speaker 0: Let's make one with a sphinx in it.

662
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,540
Speaker 1: Just all riddles.

663
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,459
Speaker 0: It's just sphinx, and then you get past it, it's another sphinx.

664
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,897
Speaker 1: And if you get... But the only, like, one design pattern...

665
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,579
Speaker 0: And then the last sphinx isn't a riddle, you just have to fight it.

666
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,320
Speaker 1: Well, like, in particular, this video points out...

667
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:31,060
Speaker 0: And it's a lion in a sphinx costume.

668
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:31,617
Speaker 0: Get ready.

669
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,459
Speaker 0: We didn't sedate it.

670
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,840
Speaker 1: The consensus design for escape rooms...

671
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,719
Speaker 0: We spray meat on you.

672
00:40:38,941 --> 00:40:49,780
Speaker 1: Is that people are very unwilling, at least the majority of them, to put red herrings and dead ends, which further exacerbates the problem if all escape rooms have the same answer.

673
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:54,079
Speaker 0: If you're running an escape room business, you don't want red herrings and dead ends, you want people out so you get the next group in.

674
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,840
Speaker 1: Well, no, they're in there for the same amount of time.

675
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,960
Speaker 1: You get kicked out at the end of the time, no matter what, usually.

676
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:58,558
Speaker 0: Ooh, that's good.

677
00:40:58,821 --> 00:41:00,980
Speaker 1: Usually it's you got an hour, can you beat it before then?

678
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,915
Speaker 1: Otherwise, they open the door and say, "Yeah, you're

679
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:03,238
Speaker 1: dumb.".

680
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:03,979
Speaker 0: Good.

681
00:41:04,703 --> 00:41:05,259
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

682
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:09,940
Speaker 0: But the point is, it's just so disappointing that it's escape room.

683
00:41:10,341 --> 00:41:13,498
Speaker 0: You could just give someone the puzzles on a piece of paper to solve a test.

684
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:14,320
Speaker 1: Well, they did.

685
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,520
Speaker 1: That's that exit the game, which is pretty good.

686
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,060
Speaker 0: Right, but I mean, literally, you could make it really boring and it would be functionally equivalent.

687
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,180
Speaker 0: Literally just a written test, right?

688
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,429
Speaker 0: Like, "Solve this

689
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:24,057
Speaker 0: cryptogram.".

690
00:41:24,724 --> 00:41:25,937
Speaker 0: "All right, now solve this

691
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:26,179
Speaker 0: one.".

692
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:28,417
Speaker 0: "Now take the first digit of each cryptogram and put them in

693
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:28,639
Speaker 0: here.".

694
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:28,901
Speaker 0: My

695
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:33,579
Speaker 1: thing of the day, to not derail the show too much, because we've already gone 45 minutes and haven't even gotten to our review,

696
00:41:34,781 --> 00:41:34,961
Speaker 0: is

697
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:35,704
Speaker 1: this

698
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:37,231
Speaker 0: video is

699
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:44,919
Speaker 1: literally everything I thought about escape rooms, but researched and based on something other than just my own butt and my own anecdotes.

700
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:50,119
Speaker 1: So everything this video says, I agree with, and that's all I got to say about that.

701
00:41:50,561 --> 00:41:55,840
Speaker 1: If you watch this video, you can probably beat any escape room in under the allotted time, guaranteed.

702
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,580
Speaker 1: Partly because escape rooms are designed for basic people with basic capabilities.

703
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:03,659
Speaker 0: I would hope that any intelligent person could beat any escape room.

704
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,280
Speaker 1: You'd be surprised.

705
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,160
Speaker 1: I've watched people struggle with answers in escape rooms.

706
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,598
Speaker 0: We should make extra hard escape rooms.

707
00:42:11,282 --> 00:42:16,599
Speaker 1: You're just locked into a room, and there's a guy with a knife, and you have to convince him to let you out of the room, and that's it.

708
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:18,350
Speaker 1: Okay.

709
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,919
Speaker 1: In the meantime, the Book Club book is apparently still Homer's Odyssey, because Scott has still not updated the website.

710
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,700
Speaker 0: No, no, it's no longer a Greek Odyssey, it's now a Space Odyssey.

711
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,200
Speaker 1: Yep, 2001 is Space Odyssey.

712
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:32,940
Speaker 1: We are going to be live at PAX Unplugged doing at least one event.

713
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:42,220
Speaker 1: We're going to be teaching people not only how to play Puerto Rico, but how to be good at Puerto Rico, and then how to be perfect at Puerto Rico, and they're going to make them all play Puerto Rico.

714
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,160
Speaker 0: At least three player perfect Puerto Rico.

715
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we've got to play some four and five player.

716
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,000
Speaker 1: I got the heuristics down, but I've got to prove them out.

717
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:51,099
Speaker 1: We'll play some before Unplugged.

718
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:51,477
Speaker 1: Anyway.

719
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,919
Speaker 1: We will likely be doing other events at Unplugged, but details TBD, this is only the first one.

720
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:05,740
Speaker 1: Otherwise, tune into the Geek Night stream on Thursday, the day after tomorrow, because we will be interacting with the audience in some capacity, details TBD.

721
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,740
Speaker 0: You're going to want to install probably like Discord or something.

722
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,720
Speaker 1: Yep, well we'll play it by ear, but we're trying something.

723
00:43:12,702 --> 00:43:13,580
Speaker 1: So let's get right into it.

724
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:14,979
Speaker 1: I played this game once.

725
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,038
Speaker 0: I played it two times.

726
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,181
Speaker 1: Yep, Rise of Tribes came out in 2018.

727
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:21,440
Speaker 0: It's a board game, I think it was Kickstarted maybe.

728
00:43:21,981 --> 00:43:22,970
Speaker 0: We played it at PAX.

729
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:23,919
Speaker 0: It's a game.

730
00:43:24,484 --> 00:43:26,740
Speaker 1: It's uh, it's alright.

731
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:27,430
Speaker 0: Yeah.

732
00:43:27,704 --> 00:43:28,117
Speaker 1: It's okay.

733
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:30,160
Speaker 1: I don't ever need to play it again.

734
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:51,040
Speaker 0: The way I feel about this game is it seems like someone like took or came up with and combined a bunch of okay to good to sometimes slightly clever game mechanics and mixed them up into a perfectly average generic board game that is so like run of the mill.

735
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,480
Speaker 0: There's nothing exciting about it.

736
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,540
Speaker 0: It seems just like every other, you know, Euro-ish board game.

737
00:43:56,808 --> 00:43:57,017
Speaker 0: Yep.

738
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,759
Speaker 0: Like there's nothing that stands out.

739
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,140
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you think about a board game that's really great and there's something about it that's like clever or different, right?

740
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,180
Speaker 0: Like for example, Dominion basically invented deck building, right?

741
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:12,660
Speaker 0: T&E was like, aha, your lowest points is the ooh, right?

742
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,600
Speaker 0: There's no ooh in Rise of Tribes.

743
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,969
Speaker 0: It's literally just like take actions to get the most victory points on your turn.

744
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,900
Speaker 0: the game.

745
00:44:20,981 --> 00:44:35,520
Speaker 1: I mean the rules were described and I looked at the board and I looked at what I had and I looked at the and a very small number of very direct heuristics immediately became apparent and everything beyond that was random or political.

746
00:44:36,886 --> 00:44:40,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically the way the game works is you put some dudes onto a hex map.

747
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,500
Speaker 0: You're trying to take over spaces.

748
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,699
Speaker 0: You're trying to do things.

749
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:52,118
Speaker 1: Well, you're trying to get points and there's a bunch of ways to get points but the default way is to build huts and every hut you have gives you a point.

750
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,459
Speaker 0: The hut gives you a point every turn.

751
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,740
Speaker 0: It's sort of like settlers a little bit, right?

752
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:58,320
Speaker 0: Imagine it's a little like risk plus settlers.

753
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,600
Speaker 0: You get your guys on the board, take over some spaces.

754
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,959
Speaker 0: That way you can get some resources.

755
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:04,180
Speaker 0: Use the resources to put huts on the spaces.

756
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:05,265
Speaker 0: Defend them.

757
00:45:05,506 --> 00:45:10,460
Speaker 0: The huts spit out a point every turn and eventually the first person to 15 points wins, a lot like settlers.

758
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:19,640
Speaker 0: The two interesting mechanics in the game that I noticed that were cool is number one is this dice thing going on.

759
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,240
Speaker 0: So on your turn you want to take an action.

760
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,315
Speaker 0: There's four actions to choose from, right?

761
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,320
Speaker 0: There's always going to be an action that you want to take the most but each action has three dice on it.

762
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:35,280
Speaker 0: Two of them are sort of locked in and the third one is sort of like you roll, right?

763
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:36,700
Speaker 0: You sort of roll one.

764
00:45:37,623 --> 00:45:38,147
Speaker 0: Oh, that's right.

765
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:38,753
Speaker 0: I remember now.

766
00:45:38,813 --> 00:45:39,580
Speaker 0: It's been a few weeks.

767
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:42,940
Speaker 0: You roll two dice and you take two actions, right?

768
00:45:43,383 --> 00:45:44,058
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

769
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:53,960
Speaker 1: Yep, and when you take an action, you put the die you rolled which either has a sun, moon, or nothing on it into the spot of the action you took displacing one of the dice that's already there.

770
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,560
Speaker 0: Right, so each action already has like three dice on it.

771
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,220
Speaker 0: So one of the actions might have like sun, sun, blank.

772
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,700
Speaker 0: So you put your dice in there and kick out the oldest one.

773
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:12,540
Speaker 0: and maybe of the three dice that are there now that you've displaced one, maybe you've got sun, blank, sun in which case you do the action slightly better.

774
00:46:13,044 --> 00:46:15,060
Speaker 0: Maybe it'll be blank, sun, moon.

775
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,079
Speaker 0: Alright, you do it normally.

776
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,620
Speaker 0: Oh, that'll be moon, moon.

777
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,240
Speaker 0: Ah, you do the action slightly worse than normal.

778
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:26,700
Speaker 0: There's like three levels to each action and it provides this randomness to where you can choose whatever action.

779
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:29,179
Speaker 0: you can use any two of the four actions you want.

780
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,359
Speaker 1: But you have to balance what you need to accomplish with what will you enable another player to do.

781
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:42,640
Speaker 0: Right, based on what you do and what previous players have done what dice have been put in you might be doing actions slightly better or slightly worse.

782
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,525
Speaker 0: So it's variance.

783
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:45,440
Speaker 0: It's not huge variance.

784
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,120
Speaker 0: It's not game swingy variance.

785
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:50,619
Speaker 0: It's just a little bit of variance to mix things up which is pretty clever.

786
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,860
Speaker 0: But it's also because it's so constrained.

787
00:46:54,488 --> 00:46:55,320
Speaker 0: it's not exciting.

788
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,340
Speaker 1: Well, because every interaction is hyper generic.

789
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,078
Speaker 1: So while there's a bunch of stuff that has like a lot of...

790
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,740
Speaker 0: Move dudes, put more dudes out.

791
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:09,480
Speaker 1: But there's a lot of fun flavor text nonsense like oh, the cougar or whatever, the mountain lion appears and he moves around the map beating people.

792
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:16,340
Speaker 1: It's purely like the most minimal political remove a guy from whatever players in first place.

793
00:47:17,403 --> 00:47:19,180
Speaker 1: Nothing does anything interesting.

794
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:24,639
Speaker 1: Everything just does these very like plus one, minus one political actions.

795
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:30,099
Speaker 0: I feel like whoever made this was like alright, we gotta put in randomness and fun to spice things up.

796
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:34,760
Speaker 0: but we don't want to put in too much because it's too swingy and the game becomes too luck based.

797
00:47:35,524 --> 00:47:45,880
Speaker 0: Settlers let things be a little more luck based whereas this constrained all the luck into this narrow controllable band which is kind of okay for a competitive game.

798
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:51,617
Speaker 0: but what ends up happening is everything's so constrained and there's no skill testing way.

799
00:47:52,904 --> 00:48:02,840
Speaker 0: there's no difficult to figure out moves so everyone gets about the same number of victory points every turn and progresses at about the same rate.

800
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:08,699
Speaker 1: except when I played the first time I got a ton more than everyone else because I just built a bunch of huts while you were all fucking around.

801
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:09,829
Speaker 0: I tried to build some huts.

802
00:48:09,909 --> 00:48:11,039
Speaker 0: I built as many huts as I could.

803
00:48:12,962 --> 00:48:15,125
Speaker 0: There's different players to choose from different tribes.

804
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:21,258
Speaker 0: Each tribe needs a different recipe of resources to build a hut and I was like woah, woah, woah.

805
00:48:22,023 --> 00:48:26,619
Speaker 0: I was like I'm not picking one that needs three trees if anyone else has one that needs three trees.

806
00:48:27,523 --> 00:48:28,940
Speaker 0: there's a little bit of that going on at the start.

807
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:34,719
Speaker 1: so there's also a thing you can do where you can basically unlock more advanced technology that gives you more powers.

808
00:48:35,483 --> 00:48:39,300
Speaker 1: but again, super generic and super constrained.

809
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:44,180
Speaker 0: you have this deck of cards and one of the actions lets you flip over the cards.

810
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:58,340
Speaker 0: it's sort of like getting routes in Ticket to Ride where you spend an action to get more routes and then if you can fulfill them they activate, either giving you victory points or giving you powers like basketry, gather one additional resource.

811
00:48:58,663 --> 00:49:04,719
Speaker 1: so when I gather I get extra resources and it costs me two stone and a wood to build it and I guess it's worth a victory point.

812
00:49:05,844 --> 00:49:15,100
Speaker 0: the other thing is this is an event deck where if somebody rolls two identical symbols you then start flipping over cards from the event deck and that sort of mixes things up.

813
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:21,339
Speaker 1: I like events except the events are all just politics attack the player in charge or attack someone on a particular hex.

814
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:30,960
Speaker 0: there were some events that were like the next few players get some extra resources or like the barbarians come on the board and just do nothing.

815
00:49:31,362 --> 00:49:39,200
Speaker 0: yeah, the barbarians fill up one space and clog it up and in the two games I played the barbarians came out, clogged up one space and everyone just ignored that space.

816
00:49:39,322 --> 00:49:39,871
Speaker 0: the rest of the game.

817
00:49:39,892 --> 00:49:53,880
Speaker 0: in the end it's nice to spice things up with an event system of randomness but there weren't enough different events and the events weren't consequential enough that you actually had to do anything about it.

818
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:58,299
Speaker 0: it's sort of like you can have a game with no randomness.

819
00:49:58,944 --> 00:50:04,000
Speaker 0: you have a game with a lot of randomness where then suddenly your decisions matter less.

820
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,920
Speaker 0: but at least there's crazy fun things happening.

821
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:14,740
Speaker 0: this tried to strike a balance between not too much randomness so things get mixed up but it didn't have.

822
00:50:14,902 --> 00:50:23,978
Speaker 0: there's not enough complex interwoven systems to make decision making difficult so that little bit of randomness ends up being what matters.

823
00:50:25,505 --> 00:50:31,319
Speaker 0: but you lose out on the fun of randomness because nothing is extreme everything's tiny and it ends up being.

824
00:50:32,007 --> 00:50:35,860
Speaker 1: I think it's a good game for kids to introduce them to more complex games.

825
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:47,020
Speaker 0: I do think this is actually a great game of intro to euro games in general maybe even better than Settlers because it has more interlocking mechanisms that are all themselves simpler.

826
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:55,720
Speaker 0: it basically has all these basic pieces from ticket to ride there's dice rolling, there's things from Settlers there's things from Risk, there's things from Small World.

827
00:50:56,366 --> 00:50:59,600
Speaker 1: there's really good little pieces to stack the people and pieces are really good.

828
00:50:59,701 --> 00:51:11,400
Speaker 0: it's like the generic mechanics the fundamental mechanics of the main euro games of the world sort of combined into one in a really flat kind of way.

829
00:51:11,521 --> 00:51:23,820
Speaker 0: it could be exciting for someone who hasn't played tons of euro games and seen all this before but for anyone else, looking for a hard game looking for a complex game looking for an exciting game

830
00:51:24,608 --> 00:51:28,124
Speaker 1: if you're skilled at games at all the game just breaks down to being 100% purely political.

831
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:37,038
Speaker 1: whatever event happens just use it to hurt whoever's beating you as much as you can, or help yourself and get the most points.

832
00:51:38,023 --> 00:51:46,960
Speaker 0: it's like one of those games where there's a map and you can go around attacking people if you want to but it doesn't really get you anywhere and it just costs you a lot.

833
00:51:47,443 --> 00:51:56,780
Speaker 0: so everyone just sort of expands into a bunch of hexes at the start and then locks themselves in the end as opposed to, say, tempest or dingy where you're constantly bashing on other people.

834
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:05,000
Speaker 1: anyone who tried to break out or fight just sort of petered out victory point-wise because you lose all your dudes and I literally won because people didn't attack me enough.

835
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:05,740
Speaker 1: so I just got no points.

836
00:52:05,841 --> 00:52:07,580
Speaker 0: there's a limit, a number of dudes in a space.

837
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:22,051
Speaker 0: you move all your dudes into a space and crowd someone out and try to kill them, and then you lose your dudes also and now you have to spend an action the most limited thing in the game, your actions getting more dudes whereas if you had stayed put, you could have spent an action flipping over some cards.

838
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:24,580
Speaker 0: that might have been worth points or getting some resources to build a hut.

839
00:52:24,661 --> 00:52:25,618
Speaker 0: that would have been worth points.

840
00:52:26,526 --> 00:52:33,080
Speaker 1: the other problem is that it's one of those games where there's nothing to do when it's not your turn nothing at all.

841
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:41,519
Speaker 0: at least people's turns are short because they're two actions, but I think it actually would have been better to just do 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 to make the game go around faster.

842
00:52:42,868 --> 00:53:04,300
Speaker 0: ever since Ticket to Ride, I've noticed and still harp on this that a modern game a good tenet of modern game design is where players either A, play simultaneously going constantly so you're always engaged with the game or B, lots and lots and lots of short actions you're going around taking turns.

843
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:10,159
Speaker 0: those turns better be very very small and if you want to have different kinds of turns have different phases in your game.

844
00:53:10,402 --> 00:53:22,700
Speaker 1: there is a weird C alternative that I've seen particularly in 18XX games a game where there's nothing you can do when it's not your turn but there's so much planning to do that every second you have.

845
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,860
Speaker 1: when it's not your turn, you're engaged with the game thinking and planning and counting things.

846
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,547
Speaker 0: or Bonanza, it's not your turn, but you can engage with the player's turn.

847
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:30,840
Speaker 0: it is, even when it's not your turn.

848
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,779
Speaker 0: but the point is, games where you're taking one player's turn and everyone else is taking a nap.

849
00:53:37,364 --> 00:53:50,397
Speaker 1: that's not good for any genre of board game anymore, in the present day speaking of which, as much as I want to play Samurai Sword / Shogun / Ikusa it's pretty much, Scott's taking his turn, everyone just go eat.

850
00:53:50,721 --> 00:54:00,340
Speaker 0: well, that's true to some extent because before it's your turn part, there's the bidding part which is simultaneous and then well it's the combat phase, the combat phase is.

851
00:54:00,784 --> 00:54:09,949
Speaker 1: I put on the board the twenty fights I'm going to start and then we do all twenty fights in order also.

852
00:54:09,969 --> 00:54:10,617
Speaker 0: that's an old game.

853
00:54:11,266 --> 00:54:12,220
Speaker 1: it is a very old game.

854
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:15,619
Speaker 0: also, if that was a new game I wouldn't cut it any slack.

855
00:54:16,782 --> 00:54:22,280
Speaker 0: also, when you're fighting someone at least they're also rolling d12s even though the other people at the table are sleeping.

856
00:54:22,784 --> 00:54:26,389
Speaker 0: two people are rolling d12s together so it's not 100% sleep mode.

857
00:54:28,843 --> 00:54:34,880
Speaker 1: so yeah, this game, if you have kids or you're introducing kind of basic not super gamer-y friends

858
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:42,106
Speaker 0: I say if you don't have a Settlers, you don't have a Ticket to Ride you don't have any of the basic Euro games you can get this one and save yourself the trouble of all the other

859
00:54:42,207 --> 00:54:42,369
Speaker 1: ones,

860
00:54:42,835 --> 00:54:45,850
Speaker 0: but I think actually any one of those other ones might be more fun than this.

861
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:49,359
Speaker 1: this has to be for people who are younger.

862
00:54:50,363 --> 00:54:51,820
Speaker 0: this game isn't bad.

863
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,660
Speaker 0: the problem is it has nothing exciting.

864
00:54:53,761 --> 00:54:54,753
Speaker 0: it's just a straight "meh".

865
00:54:56,323 --> 00:55:01,360
Speaker 0: there's no flaw in its design, I can say "oh, the game's broken over there" because it's not, right?

866
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,139
Speaker 0: there's no, other than the slow turn-taking thing.

867
00:55:06,263 --> 00:55:09,618
Speaker 1: and actually, once you know how to play the game the turns go real quick, too.

868
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,458
Speaker 1: it's not even that big a concern.

869
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,640
Speaker 0: yeah, it's easy to learn, the rules weren't written.

870
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:20,240
Speaker 0: maybe there was one or two things in the rulebook we might have questioned, but nothing huge and devastating like other games.

871
00:55:20,846 --> 00:55:22,060
Speaker 0: I can't find any fault in it.

872
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,380
Speaker 0: that's devastatingly bad.

873
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,873
Speaker 0: there's just nothing about it.

874
00:55:24,914 --> 00:55:25,580
Speaker 0: that's really great.

875
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:26,634
Speaker 0: that makes me want to play it.

876
00:55:27,384 --> 00:55:36,760
Speaker 1: yeah, I never need to play it again and I feel like I've plumbed the fullness of its depths after two plays after one play but the two plays was like a confirmation.

877
00:55:38,387 --> 00:55:40,439
Speaker 0: the second play was not different from the first play

878
00:55:41,203 --> 00:55:49,930
Speaker 1: and the fact that you played without me and you feel the same way confirms my feelings, so yeah, if you have kids or you play with people who are not gamers this is a good

879
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:50,820
Speaker 0: game, otherwise

880
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:52,332
Speaker 1: it's not for

881
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:52,576
Speaker 0: us.

882
00:55:59,384 --> 00:56:06,640

887
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,381
Speaker 1: and now I leave you with...

888
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,737
Speaker 0: I'm laughing for real right now.

889
00:57:58,221 --> 00:58:01,312
Speaker 0: I'm laughing for real right now.

890
00:58:04,182 --> 00:58:04,980
Speaker 1: I'm laughing for real right now.
