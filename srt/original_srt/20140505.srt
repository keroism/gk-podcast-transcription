1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,920
Speaker 0: It's Monday, Cinco de Mayo 2014, I'm Rem and I'm Scott and this is Geek Nights tonight.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,108
Speaker 0: Prosumer versus professional.

3
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:22,799
Speaker 0: You probably don't want the latter even if you think you do.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,578
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,600
Speaker 1: So for the first time this year, I think it's time to bike to work.

6
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:34,080
Speaker 0: I bike to work today?

7
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:38,017
Speaker 1: So I go out and I'm like, "Oh, I'm gonna dig and get on my bike, start biking to

8
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:38,238
Speaker 1: work.".

9
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:42,920
Speaker 1: Then I checked the weather before I went to work and it said high fifties, low sixties.

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,152
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "That's warm

11
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:44,415
Speaker 1: enough.".

12
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:45,036
Speaker 1: Yeah.

13
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:47,899
Speaker 1: So I'm biking, I get to the old bridge.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,147
Speaker 0: Which bridge?

15
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:50,180
Speaker 0: The Queensborough?

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,866
Speaker 1: 59th Street, yeah.

17
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:52,160
Speaker 1: It's the only bridge I can take to work.

18
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:55,812
Speaker 1: And the wind starts going whoosh.

19
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:56,919
Speaker 1: and I'm like, "What the fuck is

20
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:57,060
Speaker 1: this?".

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,940
Speaker 0: The wind was strong enough when I hit the Williamsburg Bridge this morning to catch my new helmet and pull my head to the side.

22
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:08,414
Speaker 1: The wind was so strong that when I was going downhill, I had to pedal to go.

23
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:10,140
Speaker 1: That's how strong it was.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,298
Speaker 0: How strong was that wind?

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,503
Speaker 1: Too strong.

26
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:12,908
Speaker 1: Right?

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,160
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, when I checked that weather and saw high fifties, low sixties, you know what it said?

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,043
Speaker 1: Wind-wise?

29
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:23,119
Speaker 1: Three mile an hour wind from the north.

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, did it not say 30 mile an hour gusts?

31
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:27,925
Speaker 1: It did not say that.

32
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:31,440
Speaker 1: It was horse shit, that weather.

33
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,146
Speaker 0: See, you know what?

34
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,220
Speaker 0: I was fine.

35
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,089
Speaker 0: That anemometer?

36
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:35,200
Speaker 0: Dysfunctional.

37
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Speaker 0: While that wind was notable, it was not in any way impinging.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,470
Speaker 1: I guess I made it to work.

39
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:43,120
Speaker 1: It was not pleasant.

40
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:50,920
Speaker 0: I also have a much longer ride than you, so by the time I get to that point, I'm in that mode of just fuck it, just pedaling, pedaling, pedaling, pedaling.

41
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:54,320
Speaker 0: I mean, it takes me about a half hour to get to work on a bike.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about right.

43
00:01:56,301 --> 00:02:00,240
Speaker 1: Mostly the thing is, you know, it takes me like 15 minutes to get to Manhattan.

44
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:04,050
Speaker 1: And then it takes me 15 minutes to cross town on 49th street.

45
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:08,201
Speaker 1: because for the past, I've been biking to work since 2009.

46
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:11,971
Speaker 1: In all four of those years, well, 9, 10, well, I guess 10, so 10, 11, 12, wow, a lot of years.

47
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:22,020
Speaker 1: Every single year, as long as I've been biking to work, the left lane of 49th street has had permanent construction on like two blocks.

48
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:23,740
Speaker 0: Wow, you're right now that I think about it.

49
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,300
Speaker 1: That's never been, it's never, it's always been there all the time.

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,339
Speaker 0: Maybe they just forgot.

51
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,302
Speaker 1: Right.

52
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:31,700
Speaker 1: There's like some new buses are deciding to stop somewhere.

53
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,727
Speaker 1: It's like I was behind a bus.

54
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,380
Speaker 1: I couldn't get through the spots in between.

55
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:34,944
Speaker 0: Yeah.

56
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:35,993
Speaker 1: It's a red light.

57
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:36,739
Speaker 1: It's a green light.

58
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,380
Speaker 1: The bus zooms across the intersection, immediately stops blocking the entire right lane as soon as it gets through the intersection.

59
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,247
Speaker 1: And there was like three buses in front of it.

60
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:48,120
Speaker 1: I'm like, well, left lane gone, right lane gone.

61
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:53,056
Speaker 1: And now on top of all that, right, they decided to repave 49th street.

62
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:54,300
Speaker 1: So it's all ground the fuck up.

63
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,160
Speaker 0: Might I suggest a different street?

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,989
Speaker 1: All right, so what should I use?

65
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:58,875
Speaker 1: 51st street or 47th street?

66
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:00,692
Speaker 0: 51st, it's fine.

67
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:01,158
Speaker 0: I've used it.

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,534
Speaker 1: I'm going to try tomorrow.

69
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:02,959
Speaker 1: We'll see.

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,225
Speaker 0: Go to 55th or 58th street.

71
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:04,587
Speaker 0: 57th, I forget.

72
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,205
Speaker 1: 57th is kind of crazy.

73
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:13,038
Speaker 1: It's full of cars and shit, but yeah, 49th street.

74
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:19,560
Speaker 1: And then the part that's not all ground up, the deadliest potholes imaginable.

75
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,979
Speaker 1: Like there was one that was like a foot deep.

76
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:30,420
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a pothole near Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn that if you don't notice it and you hit it in a bike and you don't have large tires, you're just fucked.

77
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:33,106
Speaker 0: There's like two on Crescent.

78
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:34,151
Speaker 1: Crescent's got two.

79
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:36,440
Speaker 1: One farther up north and one near you.

80
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,400
Speaker 0: I noticed that when I biked your place.

81
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,139
Speaker 1: If we call 311, they're supposed to fix it.

82
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:42,426
Speaker 0: Have you called 311?

83
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:42,858
Speaker 0: I haven't.

84
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,392
Speaker 0: Well, that's why they haven't fixed it.

85
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:45,400
Speaker 0: We're waiting for you to call.

86
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,800
Speaker 1: I'm not going to stop my bike, call 311 every time there's a pothole.

87
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:49,939
Speaker 1: I think you had to work.

88
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,159
Speaker 0: So since we're talking, I guess the show's about bikes now.

89
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:55,599
Speaker 0: On my way home, because I was wearing glass and I thought, you know what I'm going to do?

90
00:03:56,181 --> 00:04:00,900
Speaker 0: I'm going to take a picture of everyone who does something egregious and like from now on.

91
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,119
Speaker 1: You're not going to be able to push the button in time.

92
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,900
Speaker 0: I was like, maybe, you know, I'll, I'll get egregious photos.

93
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,919
Speaker 0: I'll make a blog that's like shit heads in New York.

94
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I got an archive of 40 something shit heads just for my commute home.

95
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,760
Speaker 1: In like 10 minutes.

96
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,240
Speaker 0: It was like 15 or 16 people who were just biking the wrong way on a one-way bike lane.

97
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,795
Speaker 0: Two of these motherfuckers.

98
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,260
Speaker 0: There was, the street had a bike lane going the right way on the same street.

99
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,075
Speaker 1: Dude, I could have given you 10 red light runners, right?

100
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,080
Speaker 1: Just on First Avenue.

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,400
Speaker 0: I saw some teenage shit head actually just ram into an old lady.

102
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:35,975
Speaker 0: I stopped and she seemed okay though.

103
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:36,800
Speaker 0: She didn't speak English.

104
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,337
Speaker 0: And he was yelling at me like he wanted to start a fight with me.

105
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:41,850
Speaker 0: That was all today.

106
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:42,680
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

107
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:50,799
Speaker 0: Also, I had a cab honk at me and then swerve into the left lane to get around me, almost hitting another cab who then started honking at him.

108
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:52,799
Speaker 0: And then they got stuck stopping traffic.

109
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:53,460
Speaker 0: Okay.

110
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was, it was a fun day.

111
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:55,840
Speaker 1: He was in a hurry.

112
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess he had to be somewhere.

113
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:00,114
Speaker 0: So yeah, I guess there's news.

114
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:00,800
Speaker 0: It's Monday.

115
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,323
Speaker 1: All right.

116
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:03,760
Speaker 1: So it's sort of a two Twitter news, right?

117
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,060
Speaker 1: So Twitter news number one is the one that people probably care about more.

118
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:12,757
Speaker 1: And that's that Twitter is considering adding a feature that I really want, which is the mute feature whereby...

119
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,564
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

120
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:18,439
Speaker 0: The fact that you even say it's a feature you want already leads into what I have to say about this.

121
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,940
Speaker 1: Where you can follow someone, but you can mute them so you don't see their tweets.

122
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:31,720
Speaker 0: Honestly, that already belies an issue with friendship and social networks.

123
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:43,019
Speaker 0: The very fact that you need to be able to be following someone yet do not actually want to see what they have to say means that you don't want to be following them, but are under some sort of obligation to follow them.

124
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,227
Speaker 0: Yeah.

125
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:47,880
Speaker 0: Like if you follow your grandma and you don't want to see all the racist stuff.

126
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,308
Speaker 1: Now, hold on, hold on.

127
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,099
Speaker 1: I knew that you would go there because that is also the first thing I thought of.

128
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,989
Speaker 0: And I knew because of the way you phrased this that you were leading me there so that you could then redirect.

129
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,400
Speaker 0: So now I'm waiting for your redirect.

130
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,223
Speaker 1: That is correct.

131
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:03,280
Speaker 1: So you are correct and I 100% agree with you.

132
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,139
Speaker 1: If you're following someone, you don't actually want to see their tweets, just fucking unfollow them.

133
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:10,840
Speaker 1: And if they notice that or get upset by it, who gives a shit?

134
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,879
Speaker 0: Well, hopefully they'll stop talking to you and then you win.

135
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,461
Speaker 1: Maybe.

136
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:17,397
Speaker 1: The reason to mute someone is temporary muting.

137
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:27,160
Speaker 1: For example, so and so went somewhere and is tweeting like a fucking nut job because they're at some crazy event and you don't give any fuck.

138
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,588
Speaker 1: So mute them until tomorrow.

139
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:30,540
Speaker 1: That is the feature that I want.

140
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:31,628
Speaker 0: That's not a bad feature.

141
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:33,060
Speaker 0: It has to have a deadline.

142
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,019
Speaker 1: So you just go and click unmute the next day.

143
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,052
Speaker 0: I don't know because then you'll forget.

144
00:06:38,092 --> 00:06:39,180
Speaker 0: You might as well just unfollow them.

145
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:42,480
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's a page you can go that will list the people you've muted.

146
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,099
Speaker 1: I guess you could unfollow someone and follow them again the next day already.

147
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,419
Speaker 0: Which is a better thing.

148
00:06:48,420 --> 00:07:05,160
Speaker 0: I actually still wish I could, within Twitter, very easily see when people follow and unfollow me because I've noticed that the number of followers... It's not this steady, slow, slow rise, but it'll fluctuate pretty widely week to week.

149
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Speaker 0: And I'd really like to see what things I say cause a bunch of people to unfollow or follow me.

150
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,431
Speaker 1: The thing I really want is Twitter lists, which exists, but doesn't really exist on mobile.

151
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:18,220
Speaker 1: That way I could categorize everyone.

152
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:18,761
Speaker 0: Yup.

153
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:19,669
Speaker 0: Cause you know what I want?

154
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,500
Speaker 0: I'd follow a lot more people or at least have a bunch of people in lists that are basically my personal equivalent of total fark.

155
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,041
Speaker 1: Right.

156
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:33,840
Speaker 1: So it's like the people that I actually care about every single tweet they tweet, I will have in the main feed that I'm constantly reading all the time.

157
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:42,759
Speaker 1: But say there's someone who tweets about, I don't know, something I kinda care about, maybe programming stuff that I'm doing at work.

158
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:47,619
Speaker 1: It's like I don't want to read their tweets in my main timeline, but I could take all those people, put them in a list...

159
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:48,699
Speaker 0: And then when you're bored...

160
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,087
Speaker 1: And then only read that list.

161
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,300
Speaker 1: if I need to read that list, right?

162
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,472
Speaker 1: And I could be like, oh, and a Twitter in this list.

163
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:59,220
Speaker 1: I'd probably read that list constantly, but it would at least be separated from my main feed, right?

164
00:07:59,321 --> 00:07:59,660
Speaker 1: Exactly.

165
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,640
Speaker 1: But they don't add Twitter lists to the mobile app as far as I know.

166
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,517
Speaker 1: It's like, for example...

167
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,480
Speaker 0: It's like only in the web app.

168
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,611
Speaker 0: Some people probably follow me for my occasional social justice related tweet, and then they're put off by my tweet.

169
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,020
Speaker 0: that's just me saying f*ck a whole bunch.

170
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,321
Speaker 0: Right.

171
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:28,560
Speaker 1: The other thing is that there are people I'm friends with that are totally cool, and I follow them... And I like to read their tweets... But... They'll tweet like one gaming thing and like 20 social justice things, and it's like, I do not disagree with you at all in your, you know, things about social justice.

172
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,086
Speaker 1: I am 100% with you.

173
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,919
Speaker 1: But I do not want to read 50 posts about it every day.

174
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,578
Speaker 1: Why is that all you talk about?

175
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:42,900
Speaker 1: I know that it's very important, but it's not so important that I need to read 50 tweets about it when I agree with it every single day.

176
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:44,238
Speaker 1: We know.

177
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,600
Speaker 1: You know, the only other piece I can see for this... But your tweets aren't solving the problem.

178
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:48,736
Speaker 0: Is the situation...

179
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,660
Speaker 1: Anyone who's following you is already solved.

180
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,099
Speaker 0: I almost, all I really want is the ability to... I want your list, like you said.

181
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,740
Speaker 0: I would like the ability to mute a specific conversation.

182
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,820
Speaker 0: Because, you know, like maybe like me and Mike Toole will like start half arguing about something.

183
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Speaker 1: And I'll reply to just one tweet and suddenly my name is getting added in every tweet.

184
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:09,718
Speaker 1: And it's like, no, stop it.

185
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,020
Speaker 0: And then we keep arguing for like another four hours.

186
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,413
Speaker 1: I just tossed in one comment.

187
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:13,999
Speaker 1: Stop that shit.

188
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,753
Speaker 1: Stop adding me to everything.

189
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,280
Speaker 0: I kind of like the mechanism design of that.

190
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,532
Speaker 0: Like, you want to get involved in someone's argument?

191
00:09:20,552 --> 00:09:21,840
Speaker 0: Well, you're fucking involved now.

192
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:37,860
Speaker 1: See, I'm actually curious in that when I reply to a conversation that has a bunch of people in it, I will only at the people who I can tell from the conversation that my comment is relevant to and will not at the extraneous people that has the side benefit of giving me some extra characters to work with.

193
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,440
Speaker 0: I at everyone, one, out of a misplaced sense of pride for getting my ideas out with increasingly less space available.

194
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,658
Speaker 0: And two, because I just don't give a shit and I don't want to think about...

195
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,720
Speaker 1: You are not courteous at all.

196
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,980
Speaker 0: Nope, which I think is why...

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,119
Speaker 1: That is not a mystery.

198
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,640
Speaker 0: Which I think is why my Twitter followers...

199
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,860
Speaker 1: That is not a new development.

200
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:57,880
Speaker 0: I am courteous in person.

201
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,254
Speaker 1: If you are, in fact, anti-courteous, someone will tell you, "Rim, that is annoying noise.

202
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:02,957
Speaker 1: Stop making it.

203
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:03,539
Speaker 1: You will make it

204
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:03,800
Speaker 1: more.".

205
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:08,215
Speaker 1: And that is the way of rim.

206
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:13,760
Speaker 0: If anyone wants to read the Tower of Rim, that's line number one.

207
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,800
Speaker 1: If someone is bothered by a thing, do that thing as much as possible in their presence.

208
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,620
Speaker 0: But you see, you guys have to learn that if you tell me to stop it, I'll do it more.

209
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,440
Speaker 0: If you don't say anything, I assume it's okay.

210
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,379
Speaker 0: There's really no way out.

211
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:27,819
Speaker 1: Anyway...

212
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,360
Speaker 0: It's Rim's Gambit.

213
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,234
Speaker 1: So the second...

214
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,959
Speaker 0: It's my Kobayashi Maru.

215
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,260
Speaker 0: The second Twitter news... You don't even know what Kobayashi Maru is, do you?

216
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,794
Speaker 1: I've heard of it.

217
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,838
Speaker 0: Do you know what it is?

218
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,320
Speaker 1: I can't think of it right now.

219
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:37,700
Speaker 0: Okay.

220
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:39,640
Speaker 0: When you look it up, you'll laugh a little bit.

221
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:39,854
Speaker 0: Maybe.

222
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,520
Speaker 1: The second Twitter news is that Amazon is going to let you buy things on Twitter.

223
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,780
Speaker 1: Now, how the hell does that make sense?

224
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,980
Speaker 1: I can already link to Amazon...

225
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,119
Speaker 0: I can already see that being me accidentally buying a bunch of stuff.

226
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,340
Speaker 1: Right, we can already put links to things on Amazon on Twitter and they get shortened with the Amazon URL shortener.

227
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:57,199
Speaker 0: Now we know, here's the thing.

228
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:58,660
Speaker 0: I want to make it quick.

229
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,060
Speaker 0: This is something that I hate about every technology discussion, forum, site, blog, podcast in the world.

230
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:15,839
Speaker 0: And if something like this is announced and the armchair coder general journalist will be like, "But what if I make a link that auto buys something for $1,000 and someone accidentally clicks on

231
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:15,900
Speaker 0: it?".

232
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:17,440
Speaker 0: Obviously, it won't work like that.

233
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,540
Speaker 1: Obviously, you're a moron who didn't read what I actually... And the problem is, it really is not that person.

234
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:28,140
Speaker 1: It's the person who writes the headline that Amazon lets you buy things on Twitter, which is not true at all.

235
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,280
Speaker 1: That's what all the headlines say, but that's not actually what they're doing.

236
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:49,960
Speaker 1: What they're doing is, if someone tweets a tweet with a link to an item on Amazon, and you reply to that tweet with a hashtag, I forget what the hashtag is, but it's some Amazon checkout hashtag or something, it will then add that item to your cart on Amazon, but it won't check out.

237
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,318
Speaker 1: And then when you go back to Amazon and look in your cart, that item will be there.

238
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,840
Speaker 1: Now... And that's all they're doing.

239
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,140
Speaker 1: That actually... I don't know how that counts as buying things on Twitter at all.

240
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,700
Speaker 0: It's also actually, I think, pretty exploitable.

241
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,153
Speaker 1: Maybe, yeah.

242
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:06,339
Speaker 0: So, Juan, I compromise your account...

243
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:12,760
Speaker 1: You tweet something with the hashtag, and then other people tweet or retweet it, and now that item is in their carts.

244
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,300
Speaker 0: Or I compromise your Twitter account and do that to add things to your cart, and you might not notice.

245
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,000
Speaker 1: And then you accidentally check out without looking at your cart and noticing the price is ridiculously high?

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,339
Speaker 0: Which I usually don't look at my cart that much.

247
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,336
Speaker 1: Okay.

248
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,376
Speaker 0: 'Cause I add things to it over the course... Like, every few weeks, I go to my cart and I'm like, "All right, there's a bunch of stuff in here.

249
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:33,617
Speaker 0: Check

250
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:33,838
Speaker 0: out.".

251
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,030
Speaker 1: Well, you are exploitable.

252
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:38,680
Speaker 1: I actually look at what I'm buying.

253
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,269
Speaker 0: Plus, I would add little things.

254
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:42,839
Speaker 0: I'd go for, like, two or three dollar things.

255
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,320
Speaker 1: I would put my own things into fulfillment by Amazon, right?

256
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:54,419
Speaker 1: Then, with my own affiliate account, link to them, and then get people to buy them.

257
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:55,959
Speaker 0: Not a bad idea.

258
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,616
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I'll make a specific Twitter account, ScottSells, and I'll start selling all the... I'm gonna sell a bunch of shit, so maybe I'll do it that way.

259
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:03,180
Speaker 1: That'll be interesting.

260
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,140
Speaker 0: You wanna sell some of my shit?

261
00:13:05,343 --> 00:13:06,319
Speaker 1: Only after I sell all my shit.

262
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,139
Speaker 0: All right, 'cause I got some floodlights that I really wanna get rid of.

263
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:10,832
Speaker 1: I don't know how to sell those on Amazon.

264
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:11,780
Speaker 1: I only know how to sell books.

265
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,580
Speaker 0: Nah, I'm sure Amazon will take them, but it might cost too much.

266
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,158
Speaker 0: Oh, that's all you.

267
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,675
Speaker 1: Yeah.

268
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:17,819
Speaker 1: It'd be cheaper to throw them away.

269
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:23,580
Speaker 0: So, in other news, this article really hits the nail on the head.

270
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Speaker 0: The nail being something I'm pissed off about, and I have been for a long time.

271
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,879
Speaker 0: Your name is pissed off about something?

272
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,451
Speaker 0: Yeah, this issue is personal.

273
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,380
Speaker 1: Well, why don't you go find that thing that you hate so much, figure out what noises it doesn't like to listen to, and make them at it?

274
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,286
Speaker 0: Apparently, what it doesn't like to listen to is, "Hello, police?

275
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:40,830
Speaker 0: Someone stole my phone.

276
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:42,393
Speaker 0: They're right over there.

277
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:43,877
Speaker 0: I can prove it's my phone.

278
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:44,759
Speaker 0: Can you go take it

279
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:45,100
Speaker 0: back?".

280
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:45,518
Speaker 0: Nope.

281
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,380
Speaker 0: So, I guess that annoying noise.

282
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,380
Speaker 1: That's always weirded me out, because it's like the police won't go and get your phone when it's right there.

283
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:02,320
Speaker 1: But if you're on the street, and your phone was literally just stolen like a minute ago, and there's a cop who happens to be nearby, they'll start a chase with no problems.

284
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,180
Speaker 0: Well, that happened when my bike got stolen the second to last time.

285
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:09,551
Speaker 0: I called the police, and they were like, "When did it get

286
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:09,912
Speaker 0: stolen?".

287
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,437
Speaker 0: I was like, "In the last five minutes,

288
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:11,899
Speaker 0: tops.".

289
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:15,880
Speaker 0: And then cop cars rushed over and canvassed the area.

290
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:25,660
Speaker 0: But when they didn't find the guy right away, they instead pressured me into not... They didn't actually want me to file a police report, because crime statistics.

291
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,379
Speaker 0: So, here's the deal.

292
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:33,220
Speaker 0: Police departments around the US are warning people that we have the technology now.

293
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:44,259
Speaker 0: If your Xbox or your iPhone gets stolen, odds are you can use technology to find out what house it's in right now, because the people who steal them usually just fucking use them.

294
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:47,420
Speaker 0: They just fucking use them because the cops don't do anything.

295
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:58,720
Speaker 1: All the cops will actually do is take the serial numbers of those objects, if they're expensive, and give them to pawn shops, and then the legit pawn shops, which I guess if the criminal's really dumb, they'll take it to a legit pawn shop.

296
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,540
Speaker 0: If the criminal's smart, he'll just use it as long as he can.

297
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,320
Speaker 1: Or sell it to a non-legit pawn shop or something.

298
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,260
Speaker 0: Just use it for your phone.

299
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:13,060
Speaker 1: And if that serial number appears, those places are supposed to report it to the police or whatever, and they usually kind of do.

300
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,204
Speaker 0: I guess.

301
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:15,960
Speaker 0: I don't really interact a lot with pawn shops.

302
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Speaker 1: That's really your only hope.

303
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:26,572
Speaker 0: So, the police are warning people that even though we have this trivial technology to, "Oh, my iPhone was stolen, and it's at this apartment building.

304
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:27,997
Speaker 0: Oh, it's walking down the street.

305
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:28,539
Speaker 0: Oh, it's that

306
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:28,799
Speaker 0: guy.".

307
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:32,260
Speaker 0: They're telling us to not confront the people who have them to get them back.

308
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,790
Speaker 1: Well, it is dangerous to do so.

309
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:35,260
Speaker 1: There's no question about that.

310
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,473
Speaker 0: And they're saying, "You should come to the

311
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:36,817
Speaker 0: police.".

312
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,980
Speaker 0: But I know for a fact that the police give zero shits about this.

313
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,451
Speaker 1: I think the real solution here is legislative.

314
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:46,280
Speaker 1: There needs to be a law that says the-- The police must investigate.

315
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:53,900
Speaker 1: I think--no, it's the--I don't know what you should--something along the lines of the Consumer Detective Act.

316
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,740
Speaker 0: Like, if you have on your own collected sufficient evidence that, you know-- I can shoot holes in this idea right now, but I'll let you finish.

317
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,259
Speaker 1: Yeah.

318
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:16,139
Speaker 1: I like the idea, but-- If you have proved and collected significant evidence, there needs to be a place where someone whose job it is to look at the evidence you brought-- Officer Scott, I've collected significant evidence that aliens stole my cell phone.

319
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,998
Speaker 1: Wow.

320
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,420
Speaker 0: Followed by literally thousands of pages of documentation.

321
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:24,320
Speaker 1: And your evidence is bullshit.

322
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, my evidence is bullshit, so yeah, everyone's evidence is bullshit.

323
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,607
Speaker 1: You just take it to this person who looks at it, and the person goes-- And I know how that'll work.

324
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,379
Speaker 0: That person will say it's all bullshit no matter what.

325
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,338
Speaker 0: Because they don't want to deal with it.

326
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,311
Speaker 1: Point is, there should be, you know, obviously you have to word the law in a way.

327
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,020
Speaker 1: a lawyer would word it so that there aren't stupid loopholes.

328
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,980
Speaker 1: The rim is shooting in a thing that I just said two words of.

329
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,810
Speaker 1: Actually, all I would-- And the police will be forced by law to where.

330
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,336
Speaker 1: if you say, "Find my iPhone.

331
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:50,718
Speaker 1: Here it is.

332
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:51,139
Speaker 1: It's in this

333
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:51,300
Speaker 1: house.".

334
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,409
Speaker 1: They have to go and get it.

335
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:53,599
Speaker 1: Or you can sue them.

336
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:54,899
Speaker 1: That's how it needs to be.

337
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,140
Speaker 0: Or maybe it says if the police won't do it, you get a vigilante license.

338
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:00,326
Speaker 1: The police won't do it.

339
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:03,040
Speaker 1: They have to compensate you and give you what your iPhone is worth.

340
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,578
Speaker 0: That'd be cool.

341
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,160
Speaker 1: Right?

342
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,809
Speaker 1: It's like, "I have proof my iPhone is in this house.

343
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,358
Speaker 1: Either you help me go retrieve it, or you buy me a new

344
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:09,800
Speaker 1: iPhone.".

345
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,469
Speaker 1: And by law, they must do it.

346
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,460
Speaker 1: And if they don't, you can take them to court.

347
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,917
Speaker 1: And if you win in court, they pay your court fees too.

348
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:18,940
Speaker 1: And compensate you for your time of going to court.

349
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:24,040
Speaker 1: And the officer who refused gets fired and is never allowed to be police or military ever again in their whole lives.

350
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:31,220
Speaker 0: This is a specific example of that situation where technology has gotten to a point to where we can do ghost-in-the-shell shit.

351
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,634
Speaker 0: If someone steals your stuff, we know where it is.

352
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:34,238
Speaker 0: Just go get it.

353
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,340
Speaker 1: Right, but I'm not the invincible major who can actually go and get the thing.

354
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,773
Speaker 0: Ah, but the police could use this technology to improve the quality of life of everyone.

355
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:49,820
Speaker 0: I mean, imagine if all the petty crimes that were solvable by technology in New York City were solved.

356
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:58,300
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that a large percentage of the people who are mugging people for their cell phones would no longer be in polite society within a few months.

357
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,180
Speaker 1: I mean, if this law existed, I would buy a $2,000 bike, I'd put a GPS in it, right?

358
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,920
Speaker 0: And I'd use my bike all the time.

359
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,485
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even lock it.

360
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,399
Speaker 1: I would leave that shit on the street, and I'd be like, "Go for

361
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:12,479
Speaker 1: it.".

362
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:20,280
Speaker 0: You know, Scott, I'm of the mind that while I want the government to take care of a lot of things, I believe in a modicum of due diligence.

363
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:26,800
Speaker 0: Like, a guy shouldn't steal your car if you leave the keys in it, but if you leave the keys in it, you're a dumb fuck.

364
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:37,380
Speaker 1: If I can find it, if I know with 100% certainty that if you take it, I'll know where it is, and you will be arrested, that's like bait.

365
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,780
Speaker 1: I'd just buy shit that's expensive and leave it the fuck around with GPS in it, and it would just help fix the problem faster.

366
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:48,300
Speaker 0: I start stealing bikes, putting them in Faraday cages and removing their obvious GPS units.

367
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,575
Speaker 1: That's obviously, I said, if there's 100% certainty.

368
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,380
Speaker 0: There's no certainty in life.

369
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,539
Speaker 1: There is a certainty.

370
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,670
Speaker 0: There's no certainty in anything.

371
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:56,419
Speaker 0: Solipsism.

372
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,771
Speaker 0: Anyway, my point is this.

373
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,580
Speaker 0: This is a specific example.

374
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,051
Speaker 0: I mean, we have friends who have had shit stolen.

375
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:05,920
Speaker 0: Scott knew where his Xbox was.

376
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:12,640
Speaker 0: Another friend actually had the ad for her bike that was stolen on Craigslist in her neighborhood.

377
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,859
Speaker 0: The cops basically told her to go fuck herself.

378
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,320
Speaker 1: Yep.

379
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:23,780
Speaker 0: Either legislation needs to fix this or, guys, seriously, get a really big friend or find a Hell's Angel and just go get your phone back.

380
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,569
Speaker 1: I think we should just start a company, right?

381
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:27,217
Speaker 1: We hire some people who are like...

382
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:29,020
Speaker 0: Hire a vigilante.

383
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:37,920
Speaker 1: No, we just hire people who were bounty hunters or were bouncers or those security professionals.

384
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,779
Speaker 1: Legitimate people who aren't crazy in the head because a lot of people...

385
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,279
Speaker 0: I would hire only off-duty cops.

386
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,295
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good one, too.

387
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,020
Speaker 0: Or retired cops.

388
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,388
Speaker 1: Also good, right?

389
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,100
Speaker 1: Any of those types of people, right?

390
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,640
Speaker 1: And some of those people in those professions are crazy in the head, so we would make sure we only hire the not-crazy-in-the-head ones.

391
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:07,060
Speaker 1: And all we would do is if you come to us and prove that your phone or your whatever is at a specific place with the serial numbers or some evidence that we're comfortable with, you pay us a fee and we will go and recover your item.

392
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:09,560
Speaker 1: But we'll go with you to recover your item.

393
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:24,880
Speaker 0: I'm mostly mad about the fact that police departments seem to be advocating that the correct solution to this is that stolen phones should have mandated kill switches to make them not valuable, as opposed to trivially arresting people who are probably guilty of more than one crime.

394
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:26,959
Speaker 1: Well, here's the reason for that, right?

395
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:31,740
Speaker 1: They don't want you to go to someone's house because it's dangerous, right?

396
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:36,100
Speaker 1: Killing the phone proposes no danger to anyone.

397
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:42,500
Speaker 1: If a cop has to drive somewhere and knock on a door, that's one more dangerous situation they have to be in.

398
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,160
Speaker 1: They would rather no one be in any dangerous situation.

399
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:47,038
Speaker 0: But I would argue...

400
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,375
Speaker 1: I'm like, sorry, your job is to go into the dangerous situation.

401
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:51,320
Speaker 1: That's what you signed up for.

402
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,940
Speaker 1: Someone has to do it.

403
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:53,940
Speaker 1: That's a separate discussion.

404
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:58,480
Speaker 1: When there's a cop has a funeral, isn't there all this talk about bravery and courage?

405
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:09,160
Speaker 1: It's like our whole society now looks down on bravery as stupidity, but it's like they want to use the word all the time to congratulate themselves, but they don't want to actually practice it.

406
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,140
Speaker 1: And the rare case that someone actually does, it's like, oh my God, it's like, no, all of you should be doing that, right?

407
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:27,540
Speaker 0: I think there's a side discussion to be had here that in general, because the police by and large will not help people with the kinds of crimes that most people experience, people don't really trust the police.

408
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,000
Speaker 1: That's one reason people don't trust the police.

409
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,338
Speaker 0: I am way more nervous around police than I am around shady hooded figures in an alley at night.

410
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:35,940
Speaker 0: Like, for real.

411
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,780
Speaker 1: I would be much more afraid of weird things that could happen if I go to the police station and say the wrong thing.

412
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:44,600
Speaker 1: And weird things that could happen if I go try to recover my phone.

413
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,799
Speaker 0: The only thing I'm more afraid of than cops is judges.

414
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,160
Speaker 0: When I'm in a courtroom, I'm just sitting perfectly silent, even if I'm not on trial, just like, please don't send me to jail for nothing.

415
00:21:55,342 --> 00:22:00,300
Speaker 0: I guess I'd be more afraid if I was in a jail that they'd accidentally keep me there, but I don't go into jails.

416
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,719
Speaker 0: And I will never will.

417
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:02,236
Speaker 1: Or prison.

418
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,100
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

419
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,380
Speaker 1: I'm just going to leave my phone here and call the police and be like, this guy, my friend stole my phone.

420
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,427
Speaker 0: I'm sure they'll come after me.

421
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:17,476
Speaker 0: I'm sure that'll happen.

422
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,820
Speaker 1: You'll go to that jail you never wanted to go to.

423
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:23,400
Speaker 0: I'm sure the police will get right on recovering that cell phone.

424
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:24,360
Speaker 1: Maybe they will.

425
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,920
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, I'll be in your apartment, I'll claim squatters rights.

426
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:29,779
Speaker 0: It'll take you at least three months to kick me out.

427
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:36,180
Speaker 0: Plus, I've never actually been convicted of trespassing, breaking, or entering.

428
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:38,439
Speaker 0: Though I've been chased before.

429
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:41,539
Speaker 0: So yeah, things of the day.

430
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,359
Speaker 0: I've got kind of serious things of the day.

431
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,899
Speaker 1: The mayonnaise is a big deal.

432
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:46,983
Speaker 0: Mayonnaise?

433
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:47,510
Speaker 1: I don't like mayonnaise.

434
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,118
Speaker 1: It doesn't taste good.

435
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:49,700
Speaker 0: What the fuck, Scott?

436
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,899
Speaker 1: Chipotle mayo tastes good.

437
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,540
Speaker 0: That's just mayo plus something.

438
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that covers up the nasty taste of regular mayonnaise.

439
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:57,660
Speaker 0: How can you hate mayonnaise?

440
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,318
Speaker 0: It's disgusting.

441
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,780
Speaker 0: It's as American as apple pie and trans fat.

442
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,720
Speaker 1: I'd never put mayonnaise on something on purpose.

443
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,400
Speaker 1: If I get like a chicken sandwich or something, it happens to be on there.

444
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,959
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, but yeah, I'd never put mayonnaise on something intentionally.

445
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:11,266
Speaker 0: So, mayone.us.

446
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:13,000
Speaker 0: We don't talk about politics often on Geek Nights.

447
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,439
Speaker 0: We will do a Thursday show about this in depth later.

448
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,260
Speaker 0: Scott and I both gave money to a super PAC.

449
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,358
Speaker 0: That shit doesn't happen.

450
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:35,880
Speaker 0: So, I urge you to go to this thing, read about it, and consider the fact that me, I'm a little more politically motivated, and Scott gave money to a political cause.

451
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,200
Speaker 1: Well, it's, you know, why'd lack political motivation?

452
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,480
Speaker 1: Because government's just fucking corrupt and you're not gonna do anything anyway.

453
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:47,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, Lawrence Lessig's argument, corruption is the first thing we have to solve.

454
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,559
Speaker 0: We can't solve anything until we solve corruption.

455
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:50,868
Speaker 1: I 100% agree with that.

456
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,579
Speaker 1: I agreed with it before he even said it.

457
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:59,940
Speaker 0: So, as I've noticed, I was going through some of the details, it seems like mostly Democrats are on board with this, and mostly Republicans are not.

458
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,000
Speaker 1: Well, but they're both corrupt as fuck.

459
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are, but Democrats are at least paying this some lip service.

460
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:05,918
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.

461
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
Speaker 1: He's been playing at lip service for how many years and done nothing.

462
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:09,621
Speaker 0: He?

463
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:11,616
Speaker 0: So, the Democrats are embodied as a male?

464
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:15,935
Speaker 1: Obama, specifically, said in his campaign- Oh, Obama.

465
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:24,459
Speaker 1: Yes, he specifically said that he would do things to fight, you know, the influence of money in Washington, and it's been like six years, and he's done nothing.

466
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,760
Speaker 0: Well, because it's Congress's job, really.

467
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:29,110
Speaker 1: He didn't even say anything.

468
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,900
Speaker 1: Since being elected, he did nothing.

469
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,680
Speaker 1: Didn't even say something, like, "Hey, Congress-".

470
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,260
Speaker 0: Well, that's because he's too busy covering up the aliens at Benghazi.

471
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,202
Speaker 1: Obviously.

472
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:40,020
Speaker 1: Actually, Bill Clinton said, there was an interview with him, unrelated.

473
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,360
Speaker 1: Well, somewhat related.

474
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,020
Speaker 1: He said that when he became president, he sent his aides to go check out Area 51 for aliens, and that there weren't any.

475
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:53,421
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure that, one, even if- I mean, I'm assuming there's no aliens in Area 51.

476
00:24:53,421 --> 00:25:03,260
Speaker 0: But, if there were, the aides who came back were either lizard people, clones- Of course.

477
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,140
Speaker 0: And if he said he wanted to go there himself, they'd just drive him to some warehouse somewhere.

478
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:17,900
Speaker 1: But anyway, the mayonnaise, right, the deal is, is they're gonna have a super PAC, and use the money to, basically, run ads to make sure that corrupt fucking congressmen don't get elected.

479
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Speaker 1: On an individual level, so they're gonna pick specific elections- And beat them, so they don't get elected back into Congress.

480
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:36,080
Speaker 0: They're trying to get the most bang for their buck, and, basically, the deal is, if they get a million dollars worth of pledges, they have unnamed donors who will match that, doubling our power.

481
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:48,460
Speaker 1: So there are at least some rich people who don't want to have to pay- They would rather not have to pay Washington and have the government be uncorrupt, than just pay Washington and get what they want.

482
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,459
Speaker 0: Now, this is the same Lawrence Lessig that you're thinking of.

483
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:59,640
Speaker 0: He's also proposed a constitutional amendment in his free ebook, One Way Forward, that is a specific proposal on a way to fix this problem.

484
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,640
Speaker 0: Since no one paid attention to that, he's doing this instead.

485
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,660
Speaker 1: Right, now how much confidence do I have that this will work in any way?

486
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:06,540
Speaker 0: More than zero!

487
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,292
Speaker 1: More than zero, which isn't much, but you know what?

488
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,860
Speaker 1: What else has any chance at all?

489
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,980
Speaker 1: Nothing realistic that anyone has proposed or is doing at all in any way, anywhere.

490
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,800
Speaker 0: The money I gave this thing probably counts more than any vote I've ever cast.

491
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:29,120
Speaker 1: Right, so, I mean, the arrow's probably gonna miss, but no one else shooting any, so might as well shoot if I don't pay and ain't gonna shoot.

492
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,299
Speaker 0: Unless he's aiming at us, but at least it's Lawrence Lessig.

493
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,559
Speaker 0: He definitely is not aiming at us.

494
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,100
Speaker 1: Look, guys, if we can- Lawrence Lessig, certified, smart, good person.

495
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,960
Speaker 0: If we can't trust Lawrence Lessig, we should just end human society right now, because we're fucked.

496
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:53,020
Speaker 1: One thing I am worried about, right, and this is sort of con- also cons- you know, speaking of aliens, conspiracy nuttiness, right, but if this shit starts to move, right, it's sort of like, it's all him, right?

497
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,779
Speaker 1: If someone tries to assassinate him, what are we gonna do?

498
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:13,100
Speaker 0: No one cares about it now, but if there's significant progress, and we're getting close to the point where we can do something- He assembled a board of directors that- imagine if you did this, and you assembled the board of directors of people to work with you on it.

499
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:14,409
Speaker 0: He did the same thing.

500
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:15,820
Speaker 0: He's got a bunch of people working on it.

501
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:17,899
Speaker 0: You'd probably have to take all of them out.

502
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:24,709
Speaker 1: Listen, these powers that be that can control a government with money can kill a bunch of people in a- I'm gonna make a reference.

503
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:26,020
Speaker 0: I'm curious if you get this reference.

504
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,509
Speaker 0: You got to be a spirit.

505
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:28,800
Speaker 0: You can't be no ghost.

506
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:29,800
Speaker 1: Okay.

507
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,048
Speaker 0: It's ultra relevant.

508
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:34,080
Speaker 0: You have no idea?

509
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:38,120
Speaker 1: I know, it's that movie where the guy's president but he doesn't give a shit.

510
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,709
Speaker 0: Okay, you know.

511
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:39,320
Speaker 0: Bullworth.

512
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:39,677
Speaker 1: Yeah.

513
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,242
Speaker 1: Yeah.

514
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:41,148
Speaker 0: Good movie.

515
00:27:41,631 --> 00:27:42,840
Speaker 0: Really depressing movie.

516
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:46,476
Speaker 1: I prefer Dave, which is just like, "I'm president?

517
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:47,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just gonna do

518
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:47,400
Speaker 1: it.".

519
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,680
Speaker 0: Dave is the eagle of American politics.

520
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,766
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.

521
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dave and Eagle are my style.

522
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think Bullworth is the-.

523
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,460
Speaker 0: no, this is how it really would go down.

524
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:55,917
Speaker 0: That's right.

525
00:27:57,905 --> 00:27:58,679
Speaker 0: So you got a thing of the day?

526
00:27:59,061 --> 00:27:59,423
Speaker 1: I do.

527
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:02,040
Speaker 1: So this guy had this idea, genius idea.

528
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:07,325
Speaker 1: Every day he gets up and looks in the mirror in the bathroom, and he sees his ugly face, and he says, "You know what?

529
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,860
Speaker 1: It'd be really cool if when I looked at this mirror, I saw other things while I was brushing my teeth.

530
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,340
Speaker 1: For example, maybe news headlines, or the weather, and we have technology.

531
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,288
Speaker 1: Why can't that happen?

532
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:17,620
Speaker 1: How much time would I save?

533
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,149
Speaker 1: I wouldn't sit at my computer.

534
00:28:19,472 --> 00:28:20,580
Speaker 1: I could do two things at once.

535
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,900
Speaker 1: I could wash my face and my hands and also get the news reading done.

536
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:25,280
Speaker 1: How much time would I save in the morning?

537
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,774
Speaker 1: I could bike around a little bit and then go to

538
00:28:27,815 --> 00:28:27,976
Speaker 1: work.".

539
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:30,339
Speaker 1: So you know what he does?

540
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,139
Speaker 1: He goes and first he acquires a piece of observation glass, which is not the same as one-way glass.

541
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:41,200
Speaker 1: One-way glass is one side is black and the other side you see through.

542
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,740
Speaker 1: Or one side is a mirror and the other side you see through.

543
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:52,960
Speaker 1: This is what they have in police observation rooms, where if the lights in one room are on and the other ones are off, then you can only see through one way and the other side's a mirror.

544
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:56,200
Speaker 1: But if the lights in both rooms are on, it's just a piece of glass.

545
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:58,120
Speaker 1: And it's crazy that that even works.

546
00:28:58,241 --> 00:28:59,960
Speaker 1: But I'm sure the internet will tell you how that works.

547
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:01,640
Speaker 1: I didn't look it up on the internet yet.

548
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:15,059
Speaker 1: Then he took that piece of glass that it was kind of hard to get, actually, and he put a monitor behind it, and he made a webpage on the monitor with a Raspberry Pi with a black screen, and he only put the stuff he wanted to see in white text.

549
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:20,019
Speaker 1: So it's like a mirror that he can look at his own face in, but then information shows through.

550
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,812
Speaker 0: That's the kind of thing you see in movies that you think, "Oh, that'd be really

551
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:23,037
Speaker 0: cool.".

552
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,380
Speaker 1: Well, it exists today and you can build your own and maybe you can turn it into a product.

553
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:29,500
Speaker 0: And hopefully not burn your bathroom down.

554
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,840
Speaker 1: And get a good price in observation glass and shitty Chinese LCD screens.

555
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:36,599
Speaker 0: I'd be worried about burning my bathroom down, at least a little bit.

556
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,351
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe you don't put it in the bathroom.

557
00:29:38,371 --> 00:29:39,220
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a bedroom mirror.

558
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:40,912
Speaker 0: I don't have a bedroom mirror.

559
00:29:40,972 --> 00:29:41,599
Speaker 0: Maybe I should get one.

560
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,780
Speaker 1: So you can look at your -- hang it on the ceiling?

561
00:29:44,804 --> 00:29:47,720
Speaker 0: The only mirror I have is in the bathroom, which sometimes is a problem, actually.

562
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:53,400
Speaker 1: The only thing I really like -- my mirror is gigantic in the bathroom, but I lack the full-length mirror.

563
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,118
Speaker 0: Because you really got to see if those slacks are -- I know.

564
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,000
Speaker 0: Matching the purse and the shoes.

565
00:29:59,520 --> 00:29:59,587
Speaker 0: Yep.

566
00:30:01,242 --> 00:30:02,039
Speaker 0: All right, metamoment.

567
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,304
Speaker 1: Oh.

568
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:03,039
Speaker 1: Connecticut.

569
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:04,597
Speaker 0: It's coming up.

570
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,980
Speaker 1: Oh, is it the next convention?

571
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,898
Speaker 0: It's the next convention we're going to be going to.

572
00:30:09,061 --> 00:30:10,120
Speaker 0: So Connecticut's awesome.

573
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,400
Speaker 0: If you didn't submit a panel, well, it's way too fucking late for that.

574
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:16,800
Speaker 0: I'm in the middle of scheduling everything, currently.

575
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:19,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, Connecticut's awesome.

576
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,219
Speaker 0: It's the best non-Pax, non-Magfest gaming convention I can think of in the United States.

577
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,310
Speaker 1: Okay.

578
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,718
Speaker 0: Pretty much straight up.

579
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,378
Speaker 1: All right.

580
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:32,480
Speaker 1: Other news I can see on my calendar.

581
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,000
Speaker 1: Today is Cinco de Mayo.

582
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:35,600
Speaker 1: Party.

583
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,499
Speaker 0: I saw the most racist ad that a frat put out for their Drinco -- It was all Corona?

584
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:46,680
Speaker 0: They put on a Drinco del Mayo event, and the poster was racist to the point of,

585
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,428
Speaker 0: "Ah.".

586
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:47,583
Speaker 1: Ah.

587
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,167
Speaker 0: Ah.

588
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:50,600
Speaker 0: It was really bad.

589
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,140
Speaker 0: I think their frat guy kicked off campus, though.

590
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:53,558
Speaker 1: Good.

591
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:58,939
Speaker 1: I guess the Netrunner Regionals, where I live, are coming up.

592
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,407
Speaker 1: So there's one on the 28th -- oh, 21st of June, and one on the 19th of July.

593
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,357
Speaker 1: All right.

594
00:31:06,722 --> 00:31:08,100
Speaker 1: One's in Boston, one's in Philly.

595
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,118
Speaker 1: Fuck you, not putting one in New York.

596
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,839
Speaker 1: What other news is there, really, for meta-ness?

597
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,698
Speaker 1: Oh, the book club is -- You forgot the name again.

598
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:18,860
Speaker 0: It's your book.

599
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:19,733
Speaker 0: Yup.

600
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,096
Speaker 0: Yup.

601
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,319
Speaker 1: I didn't start reading it yet.

602
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:22,358
Speaker 1: I probably should acquire it.

603
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,280
Speaker 0: I'll acquire it and read it because I'm flying.

604
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,739
Speaker 0: There's going to be no Geek Nights next week.

605
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:30,960
Speaker 0: I've got to fly to London and Stockholm and Hamburg and Dublin.

606
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,018
Speaker 1: I guess I'll be biking and Netrunning.

607
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:33,871
Speaker 0: Yup.

608
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:35,380
Speaker 0: So no Geek Nights.

609
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,680
Speaker 0: We'll see if we get anything done this coming weekend to have a little bit of bonus content along the way.

610
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:40,679
Speaker 0: Stay tuned.

611
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,960
Speaker 0: Tuesday episodes of Geek Nights will be streaming live on Twitch once we short out the rest of the shit to make that happen.

612
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,319
Speaker 0: A lot of shit that has to be sorted for that.

613
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:48,708
Speaker 1: Yup.

614
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:52,720
Speaker 1: For other things, check out all our stuff on the internet.

615
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,860
Speaker 1: We have YouTube channels, even though mine's mostly Netrunner videos.

616
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,300
Speaker 0: Mine's mostly Geek Nights lectures.

617
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,260
Speaker 1: We've got Twitters.

618
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,298
Speaker 1: We've got Facebooks.

619
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:00,934
Speaker 1: We've got Google+.

620
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:01,776
Speaker 1: We have IRC.

621
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,554
Speaker 1: We have a newsletter that I said I was going to write, but I didn't write, but I'm going to add it to my.

622
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:06,960
Speaker 1: Remember the Milk right the fuck now.

623
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,839
Speaker 0: Well, I forgot about it after last show.

624
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,309
Speaker 1: Yup.

625
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,339
Speaker 1: I can't log in to Remember the Milk right now.

626
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,500
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'm definitely going to write another newsletter.

627
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,600
Speaker 0: I'm definitely going to forget it until Wednesday.

628
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:16,738
Speaker 0: We have forums.

629
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,660
Speaker 1: Sign up for them.

630
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,300
Speaker 1: We have every possible thing on the internet.

631
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,079
Speaker 1: However you communicate on the internet, you should go.

632
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,840
Speaker 0: But Black Dynamite, I only use Gopher.

633
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:27,360
Speaker 1: Gopher's dead, Black Dynamite.

634
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,240
Speaker 1: It hasn't been used since, like, I'm sure someone's going to tell me it's not dead, but it might as well be dead, right?

635
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:34,079
Speaker 0: It's pretty much dead.

636
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,451
Speaker 0: Yeah.

637
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:39,280
Speaker 1: Any place you go on the internet to communicate and be with people, we are in that place.

638
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,379
Speaker 1: If you're listening to this, why would you not also be in that place with us?

639
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:43,659
Speaker 1: At least a little bit.

640
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,860
Speaker 1: Go find that place and be happy.

641
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,500
Speaker 0: So, you bought some technology.

642
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,699
Speaker 1: I guess I did.

643
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:55,500
Speaker 1: So, I bought this camera that we sort of needed, I guess.

644
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,200
Speaker 1: I mean, we didn't 100% need it, but if we want to do awesome video shit.

645
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,740
Speaker 0: It could be argued that we needed it to justify the cost.

646
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,759
Speaker 1: Sure, maybe.

647
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:07,997
Speaker 1: So, the camera I got is the GH4.

648
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,000
Speaker 1: Panasonic GH4, which is a Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera.

649
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,860
Speaker 1: But the main feature of it, compared to the GH3, is that it can record 4K video.

650
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:21,191
Speaker 1: And it's only, like, $1,700, which is very expensive.

651
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:30,100
Speaker 1: But compared to any other camera that shoots 4K, that's not like a tiny GoPro or something, this is pretty much it.

652
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,500
Speaker 1: Like, the next cheapest camera is, like, $4,000.

653
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,320
Speaker 1: And after that, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars to shoot 4K video.

654
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,699
Speaker 1: So, that's sort of ridiculous that it even exists.

655
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:41,260
Speaker 1: And it's pretty incredible.

656
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,660
Speaker 1: You can basically use this shit to make professional movies and TV shows, like Hollywood level.

657
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:52,500
Speaker 1: You know, you might need extra equipment around the camera, such as lighting and such and such.

658
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,040
Speaker 0: Yep, that's where I've been acquiring surprisingly expensive doodads.

659
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,319
Speaker 1: Yep, lighting, lenses, et cetera, et cetera.

660
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,631
Speaker 1: But the camera on its own for $1,700 does all that.

661
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:09,620
Speaker 1: Upgrade, and it helped, because I had a GF2 going to the GH4, right?

662
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,060
Speaker 1: And they both used the same Micro Four Thirds lenses.

663
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,737
Speaker 1: So, it's like, "Oh, all the lenses I already bought are still

664
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:16,018
Speaker 1: good.".

665
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:26,260
Speaker 1: And, you know, I sort of realized, since starting to get cameras that actually change lenses, the lenses are the more expensive part, and they're the part you actually care about, right?

666
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,880
Speaker 1: Because you buy a lens, it's good for fucking ever, right?

667
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,920
Speaker 1: The body of the camera, it's like, that shit, you just get new ones every few years, right?

668
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,840
Speaker 1: That shit gets out of date.

669
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:41,070
Speaker 0: So, we'll see what we can do with this.

670
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:49,050
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a lot of, like, basically what we have to do now, me and Scott, is with this new camera and actually trying to do video content on a regular basis.

671
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:58,470
Speaker 0: You might remember the old, old days of Geek Nights, like eight years ago, where it took us a while to make a pipeline that we follow the pipeline and Geek Nights comes out.

672
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:03,410
Speaker 0: Like, it used to be, like, every night we'd, like, talk for an hour about what we were going to do the show on.

673
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,049
Speaker 0: We'd fuck around the mixer and plug a bunch of stuff in.

674
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,330
Speaker 0: We'd talk a bunch, re-talk some stuff.

675
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:13,530
Speaker 0: I'd edit for, like, two hours, start the encoder, that would take, like, a half hour.

676
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,990
Speaker 0: Then we, like, manually input all this data into a website on a pretty primitive backend.

677
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:27,450
Speaker 0: It was a tough time, and over time, we refined, refined, refined, and now it takes about five more minutes than the time we spend talking to do an episode.

678
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:28,688
Speaker 0: So, we got a good pipeline there.

679
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,609
Speaker 0: Video's an order of magnitude more work.

680
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:39,690
Speaker 1: I don't think it will be possible to get the video pipeline down, and let me tell you, I used the camera to record some Netrunner games, right?

681
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:45,630
Speaker 1: I did it in 1080p, not 4K, and I did it at the lowest bitrate, which is 50 megabits per second.

682
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:52,670
Speaker 1: You could take it all the way up to 200 megabits per second, 1080p, which will do something called All Eye.

683
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:58,450
Speaker 1: So, what All Eye is, is normally, when you're, like, because it's recording, like, an MOV or MP4, right?

684
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:06,540
Speaker 1: Normally, if there's, like, two frames of video next to each other, and one pixel is the same color in both frames, it doesn't store the pixel twice.

685
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,390
Speaker 1: It's just, like, yeah, that pixel's the same, bro.

686
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:10,250
Speaker 1: And it saves space that way, right?

687
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,150
Speaker 1: When you do All Eye, it actually stores each frame individually.

688
00:36:14,691 --> 00:36:21,270
Speaker 1: So, if you edit it in After Effects or something, or Photoshop, right, you can edit all the frames individually, right?

689
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:23,295
Speaker 1: So, I didn't even use that mode.

690
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:26,183
Speaker 1: I used the 50 megabit per second, 30 FPS mode, well, 29.97 FPS mode.

691
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,590
Speaker 0: Ooh, not even 60 for that good action?

692
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I recorded all these, you know, four rounds of Netrunners.

693
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:38,242
Speaker 1: It took up almost the whole 128 gig SD card.

694
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:45,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it took an hour just to transfer that to the computer.

695
00:36:45,691 --> 00:37:00,708
Speaker 0: Welcome to my world, where our existing pipeline to video like a Geek Nights lecture, which is an hour long, on my old prosumer camcorder that has a 300 gig hard drive in it, compressed pretty heavily the video that comes out, 1080p60.

696
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:09,390
Speaker 0: It's about 20 to 30 gigabytes per panel, and that's with old-as-shit technology, heavily compressed.

697
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:16,410
Speaker 0: And it takes me a while to turn that into a resulting video that is now for people to watch on YouTube.

698
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,421
Speaker 0: So, you gonna store all that B-roll forever?

699
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:21,070
Speaker 0: Hold on to that B-roll?

700
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:22,300
Speaker 1: It's not B-roll.

701
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:23,027
Speaker 0: It's the A-roll.

702
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,310
Speaker 1: It's only A-roll.

703
00:37:24,531 --> 00:37:25,330
Speaker 0: You gonna hold on to that A-roll?

704
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:26,608
Speaker 1: I got space.

705
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,694
Speaker 0: For now.

706
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:29,929
Speaker 0: How many Netrunner things you gonna go to?

707
00:37:30,537 --> 00:37:30,808
Speaker 1: A lot.

708
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:36,761
Speaker 0: So, I'm already working on a pipeline for massive video files.

709
00:37:36,782 --> 00:37:39,990
Speaker 0: I might have to upgrade my computer in the near future to handle this stuff.

710
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,817
Speaker 1: My computer is pretty much as upgraded as it gets.

711
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:44,630
Speaker 1: I mean, my NAS is full of drives.

712
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:53,270
Speaker 1: So, you know, there's not really much I can upgrade other than getting some like monster servers or something else you can do, right?

713
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:59,830
Speaker 1: And this is what Vimeo actually does, is when they need to encode, when you send your video upload to Vimeo to get encoded, right?

714
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:06,750
Speaker 1: They send your video to all these Amazon instances that just spring up, encode your video, and then shut down, right?

715
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:12,490
Speaker 1: So, you can just like get, you know, some ridiculous cloud server on Amazon.

716
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:24,110
Speaker 1: If your internet is fast enough, upload your video, encode it, download it again, and you'll actually, if your bandwidth, if your download and upload are fast enough, you'll actually save time because the encoding will be so fast.

717
00:38:24,651 --> 00:38:32,310
Speaker 1: And you got some ridiculously powerful machine to do the encoding, which costs a lot of money, but you're only using it for what, five minutes?

718
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:38,530
Speaker 1: So, you only paid like a dollar to use that machine for five minutes maybe, right?

719
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:43,650
Speaker 1: And you can actually, you know, if it saves you a lot of time, that's fucking worth it, right?

720
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,050
Speaker 1: I would pay a dollar to save a couple hours of time.

721
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,112
Speaker 0: Yup, absolutely.

722
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:56,210
Speaker 0: But all that aside, what I've been researching, and I actually haven't bought anything yet because it's a very complex field made more complex by the fact that we live in New York.

723
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:59,290
Speaker 0: We want good microphones.

724
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,850
Speaker 1: We have lots of good microphones.

725
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,770
Speaker 0: We do, but they're very bad, they're good for recording like geek nights.

726
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:10,469
Speaker 0: They're not good for recording lectures at conventions because we can't bring all this shit with us.

727
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:13,139
Speaker 0: And even then it's hard to integrate it into their systems.

728
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:15,970
Speaker 0: and then on video, like we don't like to hold microphones.

729
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, holding microphones on video is only good in certain situations.

730
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:27,010
Speaker 1: Usually where, you know, if you're doing like a TV show, like where you're a sitcom, you don't want to see anything on the screen, right?

731
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:28,801
Speaker 1: So you need to have a boom guy, right?

732
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:30,130
Speaker 1: Holding the microphone up above.

733
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,009
Speaker 0: Or a bunch of lavaliers, a lot of ways you can do it.

734
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,070
Speaker 1: You don't use lavaliers when you don't want anyone to see the microphone at all.

735
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:35,550
Speaker 1: It depends.

736
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:40,950
Speaker 1: On a sitcom, but you could use lavaliers on, say, a talk show where it's okay for people to see that, right?

737
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:50,770
Speaker 1: But then if you're like, you know, doing an interview with someone on the street, holding a microphone as a news reporter, that's okay with a little box around it, you know, and you kind of want to have that.

738
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,770
Speaker 1: You want that there, right?

739
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,850
Speaker 1: That's like the thing that people are used to seeing and you get your logo on there and everything.

740
00:39:55,251 --> 00:40:02,750
Speaker 1: And it also helps not just on the screen when people are watching at home, but also in person, like when you're on the street, right?

741
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,290
Speaker 1: You can't just wire someone up with a lavalier to interview them, right?

742
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,469
Speaker 1: But you still need to mic them.

743
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,550
Speaker 0: It's interesting because I've seen a lot of reporters do just that when they're interviewing people.

744
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,670
Speaker 1: They wire people up with a lavalier.

745
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, they wire you up with a lavalier and then they do the interview and then they take it off.

746
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,681
Speaker 1: It's so much faster to just walk up to somebody like, "Hey, how you

747
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:17,943
Speaker 1: doing?".

748
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,070
Speaker 1: Shove the microphone in their face.

749
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,181
Speaker 0: Yeah, it depends on what you're doing there.

750
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:21,050
Speaker 0: So hence, pipeline.

751
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:28,250
Speaker 0: So the problem is, the one thing that really prevents this from being easy, we don't have studio space.

752
00:40:28,742 --> 00:40:28,848
Speaker 1: No.

753
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:34,370
Speaker 0: And even if we did, we're kind of trying to get studio space in the city somewhere.

754
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:42,570
Speaker 1: Just to the west of my apartment near the bake shop, there's all sorts of industrial-ish, empty-ish places.

755
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:47,250
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of tiny businesses that have moved in there, like Random Hair Salon.

756
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:51,343
Speaker 1: I saw yesterday, there's some Bosnian group hang out.

757
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:52,266
Speaker 1: They bought a space.

758
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,370
Speaker 1: They're renting it or whatever.

759
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,904
Speaker 1: And they were just Bosnian dudes hanging out together.

760
00:40:55,924 --> 00:40:56,870
Speaker 1: And it's like, that's cool.

761
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,170
Speaker 0: We should make a gaming society that's like that.

762
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,577
Speaker 1: I'm sure we can find a space.

763
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:02,770
Speaker 1: We just need to find a way to pay for it.

764
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's also a space that we'll then be leaving a lot of very expensive equipment in.

765
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,872
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you know.

766
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:15,310
Speaker 1: But the other key is that for lighting, to save a lot of money, if you could get some west- or east-facing windows.

767
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we totally do all our video when the sun's out.

768
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:25,150
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is, if you can get some east- or west-facing windows, you can do video in the morning or the afternoon when the sun is shining right through those windows.

769
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:31,230
Speaker 0: Actually, through the windows like that usually is not great lighting, just because of the angles involved and the glass.

770
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,690
Speaker 1: The sun is the best light.

771
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:34,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, naked sun.

772
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:36,890
Speaker 0: Not sun, through glass at an angle that you can't control.

773
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,490
Speaker 1: No, we're talking about huge fucking windows, not tiny little box windows.

774
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't exist here.

775
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:41,612
Speaker 1: It does.

776
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:44,946
Speaker 1: Some guy was telling me how he bought a space.

777
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, you told me about this guy.

778
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:49,367
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not going to happen.

779
00:41:49,427 --> 00:41:49,889
Speaker 0: Not feasible.

780
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,870
Speaker 0: Also then, what, we're only going to do video on Saturday and Sunday during the golden hour?

781
00:41:54,475 --> 00:41:56,289
Speaker 1: Well, only video that needs to be really bright.

782
00:41:58,193 --> 00:42:01,160
Speaker 0: So, here's an example of a very specific issue.

783
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:05,310
Speaker 0: I'm not going to install booms in my house for microphones.

784
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:10,390
Speaker 0: And I can't pad the entire living room in acoustic foam.

785
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:19,090
Speaker 0: So, the only way to get good audio when we do a video is either to close mic us with our existing Geeknives microphones.

786
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:20,269
Speaker 1: Which you'll see in the video.

787
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,130
Speaker 0: Which wouldn't be that bad.

788
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,449
Speaker 1: We could dub over ourselves.

789
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we'll totally do that.

790
00:42:26,352 --> 00:42:26,710
Speaker 0: ADR.

791
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,649
Speaker 0: That'll totally happen.

792
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:28,573
Speaker 1: It'll be hilarious.

793
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:28,754
Speaker 1: ADR.

794
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:39,230
Speaker 0: But because of the restrictions on the room and the fact that I also don't want to just tear apart the living room every time we do video.

795
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,130
Speaker 0: Because the idea is we're going to be doing video like once a week.

796
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:42,949
Speaker 1: Well, hopefully.

797
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, or at least once every other week.

798
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:44,928
Speaker 1: Make more videos.

799
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:51,390
Speaker 0: So, I need microphones that don't require shit to be set up in the living room to do it.

800
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:58,630
Speaker 0: Because right now, either I put these microphones in front of our faces and then they cast shadows because despite all the lights I own, there's still not enough lights.

801
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,850
Speaker 0: We can't be far enough away from the background to just green screen or whatever it out.

802
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:10,670
Speaker 0: So, the other option is I can mount one boom higher up temporarily and do a stereo mic from the ceiling.

803
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,188
Speaker 0: And it works okay, but the audio's not great.

804
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:17,050
Speaker 0: And it's a giant pain in the ass to set that up every time.

805
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:26,710
Speaker 0: So, what we want is if Scott's buying an expensive camera, I've been investigating to buy the E6 Countryman head-mounted microphone.

806
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,530
Speaker 0: Which appears to be the best head-mounted microphone.

807
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:31,970
Speaker 1: That's the one they use in the TED Talks.

808
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,700
Speaker 1: It's like a little flesh-colored stick.

809
00:43:35,302 --> 00:43:37,250
Speaker 1: Most of the equipment is on your ear, right?

810
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:40,450
Speaker 1: And then it's just sort of this little stick that comes out and then in front of your mouth.

811
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:41,570
Speaker 0: It is so tiny.

812
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:44,810
Speaker 1: You can see it, but you forget it's there.

813
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:49,910
Speaker 1: It's great if you don't care if someone sees it, but you want really high quality and you don't want to hold anything.

814
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,690
Speaker 0: Everyone I've ever talked to, all the research I've ever done, this is the fucking best.

815
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:56,969
Speaker 0: So, duh, we'll get that.

816
00:43:57,272 --> 00:43:57,430
Speaker 1: Right.

817
00:43:57,672 --> 00:43:57,758
Speaker 0: Yeah.

818
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,410
Speaker 1: But you gotta plug that shit into something.

819
00:43:59,650 --> 00:43:59,811
Speaker 0: Yeah.

820
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:02,050
Speaker 0: Now, here's where it gets complicated and annoying.

821
00:44:02,411 --> 00:44:09,630
Speaker 0: This is where professional equipment is so much more expensive and harder to deal with than prosumer equipment.

822
00:44:10,072 --> 00:44:10,955
Speaker 0: Like Scott's camera.

823
00:44:11,297 --> 00:44:14,710
Speaker 0: If we want to do full-on, full-on video, camera's not enough.

824
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:18,590
Speaker 0: We need this huge base station to plug into it, which is like two grand by itself.

825
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:19,232
Speaker 1: Right.

826
00:44:19,272 --> 00:44:23,550
Speaker 1: This camera, the reason I got it is because of that very reason, right?

827
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:30,290
Speaker 1: It's this weird piece of equipment in that, in the hands of a pro with all this extra shit, it can get the job done.

828
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,031
Speaker 1: It's great.

829
00:44:31,272 --> 00:44:38,490
Speaker 1: But also, you could just, as a photographer, just a normal person, it's totally usable, just on its own.

830
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:49,390
Speaker 1: It's extreme rarity, right, in the world of audio/video production, that this one thing, like, expands such a wide range of amateur to professional use.

831
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:49,690
Speaker 0: Yup.

832
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:55,590
Speaker 0: But even then, you need all this extra equipment and pipelines to do the, like, if you want to use it in a studio, you need a bunch of other shit.

833
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:55,851
Speaker 1: Yeah.

834
00:44:55,871 --> 00:45:01,270
Speaker 1: It's like, if you just take this to your house and, like, take a video of you, it'll probably be a good video, right?

835
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:04,089
Speaker 1: But it's not going to look like a fucking Hollywood movie.

836
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:08,056
Speaker 0: So here's the complication with the E6 microphone.

837
00:45:08,277 --> 00:45:15,150
Speaker 0: For one, it has a ridiculous number of options that if you don't already, if you aren't already an expert in this stuff, it won't make any sense.

838
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,370
Speaker 1: What could the options possibly be?

839
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:22,209
Speaker 0: It has to do with the kind of cartridge in it, how directional it is, how much padding it has.

840
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,210
Speaker 1: Wouldn't there just be the one they use at TED Talks?

841
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,722
Speaker 0: They use different ones for different people.

842
00:45:28,004 --> 00:45:28,970
Speaker 0: There's a lot of options.

843
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,162
Speaker 0: So we know that stuff.

844
00:45:31,343 --> 00:45:32,230
Speaker 0: We sort that stuff out.

845
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,288
Speaker 1: That's crazy though, right?

846
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:34,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

847
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:38,050
Speaker 1: It's like, there's no different SM58s for different people, right?

848
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:38,951
Speaker 0: Yeah.

849
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:43,750
Speaker 0: Well, do you use an SM58 or a beta 87A or a beta 58?

850
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,359
Speaker 1: This is a beta 58A.

851
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,321
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bought that specifically.

852
00:45:47,352 --> 00:45:48,969
Speaker 1: Do you need different ones or different people?

853
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:50,844
Speaker 0: So my microphone is a beta 87A.

854
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:51,972
Speaker 1: Oh.

855
00:45:53,932 --> 00:45:55,907
Speaker 0: It's got a more cardioid pattern.

856
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:56,370
Speaker 0: It's a hypercardioid.

857
00:45:57,016 --> 00:45:57,228
Speaker 0: Okay.

858
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,730
Speaker 0: Which means if I move my head too much, suddenly I'm really quiet.

859
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:02,470
Speaker 1: You also just talked really quietly.

860
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:03,034
Speaker 0: No, I guess I did.

861
00:46:03,315 --> 00:46:07,490
Speaker 0: Talking at the same volume, now I'm next to the microphone, now I'm going back to the front of the microphone.

862
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,990
Speaker 0: So anyway, tons of options, tons of complicated shit.

863
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:13,510
Speaker 0: But we know this stuff, so that's fine, and this thing's the best.

864
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,050
Speaker 0: So what do you plug it into?

865
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:25,230
Speaker 0: Well, if we just wanted to do video in the house, I could get it hardwired to XLR, powered with phantom power, plug it directly into the mixer with a cable.

866
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,610
Speaker 1: But that has a long-ass wire.

867
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,059
Speaker 0: That's fine.

868
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:27,570
Speaker 0: That's doable.

869
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,929
Speaker 1: And we couldn't really walk around a lot either.

870
00:46:29,093 --> 00:46:29,490
Speaker 1: Easily doable.

871
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,435
Speaker 1: How do you hide that wire?

872
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,930
Speaker 1: Down your shirt, down your pants, onto the floor, across the room?

873
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,190
Speaker 0: Well, down your shirt, down your pants, behind us is sitting the Marantz.

874
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:37,188
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

875
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:37,875
Speaker 0: That kind of rhymed.

876
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:39,389
Speaker 0: Like, that actually would work pretty well.

877
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:42,450
Speaker 0: There are cases where I would want to use the wired option.

878
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:48,669
Speaker 0: Like, for example, if I'm just doing a Twitch video and I got my face on screen and doing some stuff, I'd kind of just want to plug it into the mixer and go.

879
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:56,809
Speaker 1: You could also just, like, walk around the convention and sort of have the Marantz hanging, like, behind you on your belt, flapping against your butt.

880
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:57,901
Speaker 0: So here's how we do it.

881
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:58,490
Speaker 0: I wear the Marantz.

882
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,054
Speaker 1: You're wearing the thing.

883
00:46:59,094 --> 00:47:01,389
Speaker 1: The wires are behind you, but the video's only in front of you.

884
00:47:01,811 --> 00:47:03,150
Speaker 1: And the Marantz is battery-powered.

885
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:03,683
Speaker 1: Yeah.

886
00:47:04,314 --> 00:47:05,950
Speaker 1: So we can sync that shit up later.

887
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,202
Speaker 0: Lots of stuff we can do there.

888
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:07,950
Speaker 0: that's nice and cool.

889
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:12,844
Speaker 0: But the cartridge, the actual microphone, is fundamentally different.

890
00:47:13,285 --> 00:47:19,850
Speaker 0: if you want to wire it hard-wired to be able to take phantom power and plug it into a mixer versus if you want to plug it into a wireless system.

891
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:20,392
Speaker 0: And guess what?

892
00:47:20,694 --> 00:47:28,070
Speaker 0: Half the other times we want to use this is, like, at a convention, we want to use our awesome microphone instead of the shitty microphones that, like, Pax gives us.

893
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:28,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have to buy two.

894
00:47:29,752 --> 00:47:31,189
Speaker 0: So, no, we have to buy...

895
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,010
Speaker 1: A wired one and an unwired one.

896
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:33,135
Speaker 0: Four.

897
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:34,566
Speaker 1: For two people.

898
00:47:34,627 --> 00:47:34,709
Speaker 1: Four.

899
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:37,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're, like, four to six hundred bucks each.

900
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:42,490
Speaker 1: Well, my camera was seventeen hundred, so five hundred times four is about the same amount of money.

901
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:44,510
Speaker 0: Now, say we want to do wireless.

902
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,140
Speaker 1: Plus, you're not even counting the lenses I bought.

903
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,529
Speaker 1: I bought a thousand-dollar lens, also.

904
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,430
Speaker 0: That is a really good lens, though.

905
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:51,286
Speaker 0: That lens...

906
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,408
Speaker 1: I mean, because the other lenses were not really the greatest for video, so...

907
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:55,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, they're not.

908
00:47:55,735 --> 00:47:58,390
Speaker 0: Like, my pancake lens, not good at video at all.

909
00:47:58,791 --> 00:47:59,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.

910
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, zoom lens, I can kind of wing it, but I got to manual focus that shit out of time.

911
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,082
Speaker 1: No, that lens is so not sharp.

912
00:48:04,283 --> 00:48:05,309
Speaker 1: That's the cheapo.

913
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it works pretty well.

914
00:48:06,973 --> 00:48:07,647
Speaker 1: It works, yeah.

915
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:09,943
Speaker 0: Especially if I'm going down to, like, 720p, anyway.

916
00:48:11,331 --> 00:48:15,149
Speaker 0: So, wireless systems, if you've never dealt with wireless, I'll just say this.

917
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:27,970
Speaker 0: If a band tours, either every single venue they go to, they contact and say, "Take care of all the microphones for us," or they hire an RF manager.

918
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:34,430
Speaker 0: The RF manager tours with them and figures out what equipment and frequencies and everything to use in every venue.

919
00:48:35,051 --> 00:48:42,130
Speaker 0: So, if Scott and I buy some, like, cheapo wireless microphone shit, it might work here, but it might not work very well in Chicago.

920
00:48:42,812 --> 00:48:43,388
Speaker 0: Just fuck you.

921
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,149
Speaker 1: Well, isn't that why you can change, you know, channels on it?

922
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,370
Speaker 1: So, we go to Chicago, and we push the "Search for New Channel" button, and it's supposed to find a channel.

923
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:56,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, so already, if you want the ones that let you search for a channel, that's, like, twice the price getting into prosumer territory.

924
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,330
Speaker 1: All right, well, that's already mandatory, right?

925
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that already eliminates most of these systems in the world.

926
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,129
Speaker 0: So, if you look at Just Sure...

927
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,289
Speaker 1: But even if we just buy those, that should be fine, right?

928
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:05,573
Speaker 1: Eh.

929
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:07,030
Speaker 1: We don't need an RF manager.

930
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:15,470
Speaker 0: So, if those have a single antenna, as opposed to dual channel, then odds are, if you walk around at all, your audio will just periodically drop out for a second.

931
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:17,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, you added that you're not hitting the one antenna.

932
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, because fuck you.

933
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:19,909
Speaker 0: Two antennas eliminates that.

934
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:21,150
Speaker 1: All right, so you need two antennas.

935
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:22,467
Speaker 0: That eliminates a bunch more of these types.

936
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,189
Speaker 1: And searching for a channel.

937
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:25,250
Speaker 0: So, basically, eventually...

938
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,570
Speaker 1: But we have two people, so we actually need four antennas and two searching for channels.

939
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:33,570
Speaker 0: So, eventually, you get into, like, if you go to Sure, the ULX S&P series.

940
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,570
Speaker 1: Aren't they competitors?

941
00:49:35,511 --> 00:49:38,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just, I know Sure, and they seem to be the ones I'm going to buy.

942
00:49:38,914 --> 00:49:39,168
Speaker 1: Okay.

943
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:47,150
Speaker 0: I've used, like, other types before, but I've always used them in the sense of either someone else rented them and I just configured them.

944
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,821
Speaker 0: I never had to think in terms of...

945
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,330
Speaker 1: Do the Cavaliers, the Canyon people, also make the wireless things?

946
00:49:52,934 --> 00:49:53,725
Speaker 0: They actually, no.

947
00:49:54,290 --> 00:50:03,970
Speaker 0: So, when you buy their microphone, then you tell it what kind of wireless system you're going to use with it, and then they make it custom for that system.

948
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,890
Speaker 0: The connectors are all different.

949
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,727
Speaker 0: It's not just XLR.

950
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,510
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't they make an interchangeable connector?

951
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:16,890
Speaker 0: Because the voltages are also different, because if you're pushing regular old phantom power from something with a 9-volt battery in it on your back, that's not going to work so well.

952
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:19,830
Speaker 0: So, they take different voltages.

953
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:24,590
Speaker 0: So, I came down to the ULX S&P versions.

954
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,970
Speaker 0: The differences between them are almost negligible.

955
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:30,110
Speaker 1: Why do they even have two different versions?

956
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,530
Speaker 0: So, the S is considered the prosumer version.

957
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,030
Speaker 0: It's pretty much awesome, but it doesn't have group scan.

958
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:37,850
Speaker 0: ULXP has group scan.

959
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,650
Speaker 1: So, group scan is when you have more than one.

960
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:48,290
Speaker 0: Group scan says the unit will find a group, because every different wireless system has a set of channel groups.

961
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:51,670
Speaker 0: So, you pick a group, and then each microphone needs a channel within that group.

962
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:59,629
Speaker 0: So, the group scan will find the group near you that has the least interference and thus most available channels.

963
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,209
Speaker 1: And then it will give one channel to one guy and one channel to the other guy?

964
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:03,049
Speaker 0: Basically, yes.

965
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:07,550
Speaker 0: Without group scan, you have to just fucking guess at which group and then scan within the group.

966
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:19,948
Speaker 0: Wouldn't have been a problem, but the difference between the two is only like $200 per unit, and everything I ever read on the internet from anyone said, "Really wish I bought the P. Wasn't that much more

967
00:51:20,029 --> 00:51:20,250
Speaker 0: money.".

968
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:22,685
Speaker 1: Can you imagine sitting there going like, "How many channels are there?

969
00:51:22,685 --> 00:51:23,511
Speaker 1: 12?".

970
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:24,342
Speaker 0: There's like 9 to 12 groups.

971
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:30,669
Speaker 1: You sit there with number 1, and you scan it, and then 2, and then you scan it, and you're manually pushing the buttons.

972
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,650
Speaker 1: Wouldn't you pay money to never have to push those buttons?

973
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:34,313
Speaker 0: Exactly.

974
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:35,670
Speaker 0: So, this gets more complicated.

975
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,940
Speaker 0: There's a lot of cheap systems on eBay.

976
00:51:38,081 --> 00:51:38,523
Speaker 0: You know what?

977
00:51:38,785 --> 00:51:39,830
Speaker 0: That shit's all illegal.

978
00:51:40,312 --> 00:51:40,714
Speaker 1: Wait.

979
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:41,760
Speaker 1: How could it be illegal?

980
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,066
Speaker 1: If it's on eBay, it's illegal.

981
00:51:43,107 --> 00:51:46,002
Speaker 1: Wouldn't eBay say, "Hey, you can't sell that illegal equipment.

982
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:46,787
Speaker 1: We're taking down your

983
00:51:46,807 --> 00:51:47,129
Speaker 1: listing.".

984
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,330
Speaker 0: Because people don't even know.

985
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,947
Speaker 1: If I try to sell a gun on eBay, eBay's like, "Fuck

986
00:51:50,988 --> 00:51:51,149
Speaker 1: no.".

987
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:52,329
Speaker 0: A lot of people still don't know.

988
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:59,047
Speaker 0: So, in 2010, it finally became illegal to use wireless microphones on the 700 MHz band.

989
00:52:01,081 --> 00:52:01,268
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

990
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:11,710
Speaker 0: Because that band, after the whole digital TV conversion and a whole bunch of stuff that happened, is used primarily by reserved special services, police, fire, EMT.

991
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:12,933
Speaker 1: Wait.

992
00:52:13,315 --> 00:52:13,836
Speaker 1: I don't get that.

993
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:17,870
Speaker 1: Emergency services had frequencies they've been using forever.

994
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,870
Speaker 0: That were overcrowded and not that effective.

995
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:25,170
Speaker 0: The whole idea is that they rejiggered a lot of the frequencies to make better frequencies available.

996
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:29,499
Speaker 1: So, if they rejiggered over to 700 MHz, they must have left some... What were they used to be using?

997
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,470
Speaker 1: We can use that now, right?

998
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:30,793
Speaker 0: Yeah.

999
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:32,230
Speaker 0: So, that's also reserved for other things.

1000
00:52:32,451 --> 00:52:34,670
Speaker 0: And every wireless system works in different ranges.

1001
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:44,576
Speaker 0: And if you want to use a particular wireless system, the advice everyone gives you comes down to, "Well, where are you installing this?

1002
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,008
Speaker 0: What TV stations are active near

1003
00:52:48,068 --> 00:52:48,228
Speaker 0: you?".

1004
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:51,409
Speaker 0: So, shit got complicated way quick.

1005
00:52:52,472 --> 00:52:55,030
Speaker 0: And one blog listed cities in terms of difficulty.

1006
00:52:55,571 --> 00:52:56,204
Speaker 0: Like, how pro...

1007
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,630
Speaker 1: Well, New York is going to be most difficult.

1008
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, the list was like, how pro...

1009
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,630
Speaker 1: New York is god mode.

1010
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:05,490
Speaker 0: How pro does your RF manager need to be to handle a concert in this city?

1011
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,129
Speaker 0: And at the top, by itself, New York.

1012
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:15,110
Speaker 1: Right, but wouldn't you be in... Most of the good concert venues are in a shielded stage place, right?

1013
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,010
Speaker 1: Where you're not going to interfere with anything outside the building.

1014
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'll interfere with your own shit internally.

1015
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,790
Speaker 1: Right, but if you're doing an outdoor concert, fuck you.

1016
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:23,290
Speaker 1: Yup.

1017
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:28,170
Speaker 0: So, doing all this research and all this research, I finally got to the end.

1018
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,810
Speaker 0: I figured out everything to buy, kind of like how Scott did all this research.

1019
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:32,161
Speaker 0: Like, this is the camera.

1020
00:53:32,403 --> 00:53:33,130
Speaker 0: It's worth the money.

1021
00:53:33,532 --> 00:53:35,110
Speaker 0: So, I decided to get a ULXP system.

1022
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:36,388
Speaker 0: I go to buy one.

1023
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,210
Speaker 0: And then, oh, ULXP's can be bought in one of three bands.

1024
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:43,369
Speaker 1: Which one is the New York one?

1025
00:53:48,371 --> 00:53:50,370
Speaker 0: So, each band has its own set of frequencies.

1026
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:54,450
Speaker 0: They're all hardware, so if you buy one, you want to use a different band?

1027
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:55,067
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

1028
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,088
Speaker 1: You've got to buy three of each.

1029
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:58,481
Speaker 0: Also, say we buy the G3 band, I think is one of them.

1030
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:05,230
Speaker 0: And all the other systems use different bands and different band names, different band sets.

1031
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:11,410
Speaker 0: So, if you want to use that system at SayPax, depending on what band...

1032
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:17,410
Speaker 1: So, we're going to take our equipment to Seattle and then to Boston, but we might need a different one in a different place than New York.

1033
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:18,898
Speaker 0: And it doesn't just depend on the city.

1034
00:54:19,562 --> 00:54:21,010
Speaker 0: SayPax already has a bunch of equipment.

1035
00:54:21,531 --> 00:54:22,560
Speaker 0: What bands are they using?

1036
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:23,750
Speaker 0: What channels are three?

1037
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,809
Speaker 1: Can't we just hook up to their equipment?

1038
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:26,349
Speaker 0: Maybe, if they'll let us.

1039
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:26,853
Speaker 1: Oh, but wait.

1040
00:54:26,954 --> 00:54:28,990
Speaker 1: But our lavaliers are for our equipment.

1041
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:35,790
Speaker 0: Now, we could plug our lavaliers because the one part of the reason why I want to go with Shure is because every con we've ever been to has used Shure wireless.

1042
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,450
Speaker 0: And I know the connector, I know how that shit works.

1043
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,310
Speaker 0: Even the anime club at RIT, that's what we used when we had microphones.

1044
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:48,430
Speaker 0: So, we could plug our countrymen into their battery packs and just use our awesome microphone there without having to bring the other equipment.

1045
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:49,349
Speaker 0: Which is fine.

1046
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,009
Speaker 1: Oh, Zenkai Con, they had Sennheiser.

1047
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, Zenkai Con.

1048
00:54:53,372 --> 00:54:55,030
Speaker 0: PAX and everyone else had Shure.

1049
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:59,170
Speaker 0: In fact, I took pictures of all the equipment at all the PAXes to do the research later.

1050
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:03,149
Speaker 0: So, yeah, that got real complicated real quick.

1051
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:10,610
Speaker 0: And the moral of all this, I guess, is unless you need pro equipment, don't fucking buy pro equipment.

1052
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:12,493
Speaker 1: Man, it's so weird.

1053
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:21,050
Speaker 1: It's like, is it that thing with the Bloomberg terminal where it's hard just to make pros feel like they know something?

1054
00:55:21,453 --> 00:55:23,549
Speaker 1: Or is it just, it's hard because it's pro?

1055
00:55:24,092 --> 00:55:26,390
Speaker 0: Oh, and by the way, are you licensed or not?

1056
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:32,916
Speaker 0: Because if you buy some wireless microphone systems and you set them up in certain ways, oh, you're breaking the law.

1057
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:34,950
Speaker 0: You're fucked if the FCC comes knocking.

1058
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,789
Speaker 1: But couldn't you just get the license for the FCC?

1059
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:45,889
Speaker 0: FCC license for microphone broadcast locally at higher amplitudes or different reserve frequency ranges costs a lot of money.

1060
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:48,070
Speaker 1: But a ham radio license doesn't cost much.

1061
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:49,750
Speaker 0: Ham radio is a totally different thing.

1062
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:53,184
Speaker 1: Come on, all the licenses should be the same.

1063
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,010
Speaker 1: Why is this one so expensive?

1064
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:58,370
Speaker 0: It's not that it's so expensive, it's that it's expensive for us not making money.

1065
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:03,190
Speaker 0: Also, you have to have a legit reason and be something.

1066
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,170
Speaker 0: Podcast doesn't count.

1067
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,609
Speaker 1: Why don't we just go to a different country that doesn't have an FCC?

1068
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:11,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, other countries, it's way complicated.

1069
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,245
Speaker 0: Basically, all this equipment I'm looking at, US only.

1070
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:16,310
Speaker 0: Do not bring it to the EU, they'll confiscate it.

1071
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:24,167
Speaker 1: Why don't we just go to the northern, well, no, not the northern part, near the tropics on an island where there's no one interfering with anything.

1072
00:56:24,187 --> 00:56:24,690
Speaker 0: and who gives a fuck?

1073
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,604
Speaker 0: And then in the middle of our Twitch broadcast, you hear the pirate radio.

1074
00:56:27,624 --> 00:56:28,288
Speaker 0: just start chiming in.

1075
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:29,229
Speaker 0: Awesome.

1076
00:56:29,731 --> 00:56:30,770
Speaker 0: Actually, that was pretty awesome.

1077
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:33,669
Speaker 1: Dude, if I lived in a boat in the tropics, I would listen to the pirate radio.

1078
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,070
Speaker 0: I'd be looking forward to it.

1079
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:35,328
Speaker 0: Yup.

1080
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:40,087
Speaker 1: And then I'd see the guy in his boat with his big antennae sticking on and he'd say, "Hey, good morning, what's

1081
00:56:40,248 --> 00:56:40,328
Speaker 1: up?".

1082
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,478
Speaker 0: But let's say you aren't, you know, doing pro, like.

1083
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:47,210
Speaker 0: you're not trying to do live, like for real video streams to Twitch.

1084
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:51,130
Speaker 0: You're not trying to like record for real lectures at conventions on a regular basis.

1085
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:52,209
Speaker 1: Don't buy wireless.

1086
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:57,720
Speaker 0: There's cheaper consumer level systems that'll work pretty fucking well.

1087
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:02,050
Speaker 0: if you're okay with occasionally there's some static or occasionally it fails.

1088
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,110
Speaker 1: Can't we just get that and then remove the static in post?

1089
00:57:05,612 --> 00:57:08,430
Speaker 0: Well, the static removes what you were saying.

1090
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,910
Speaker 1: Well, obviously we just re-record that part with ADR.

1091
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:13,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we're totally going to do that.

1092
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:14,810
Speaker 1: Why not?

1093
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,710
Speaker 1: You'd save a fuck ton of money, right?

1094
00:57:17,391 --> 00:57:18,096
Speaker 0: Eh, would we?

1095
00:57:18,177 --> 00:57:20,110
Speaker 0: Because then we're spending time instead.

1096
00:57:20,412 --> 00:57:21,009
Speaker 1: How much time?

1097
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:21,726
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1098
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:28,310
Speaker 0: Also, the more pro equipment we have, the more likely it is a major convention would let us use it with their stuff.

1099
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:28,625
Speaker 1: Maybe.

1100
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:41,970
Speaker 0: But basically, unless you're doing something for serious and you're actually willing to do the requisite research and be an expert in that field, you should never buy professional equipment.

1101
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:48,410
Speaker 0: Because either you're going to waste money or you're going to get in trouble or break something or somehow cause a problem for someone.

1102
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:49,111
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1103
00:57:49,372 --> 00:57:52,149
Speaker 1: I mean, it sounds similar to like, so the camera, right?

1104
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:57,026
Speaker 1: The one problem I had with the previous camera is that when you record it, well, first of all, it wasn't even 1080p, it was 1080i.

1105
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:02,545
Speaker 1: But you'd record video, but if the battery ran out, video ends.

1106
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:04,070
Speaker 1: Well, that's no good, right?

1107
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:08,585
Speaker 1: I'm in a weird situation where, like, you don't really need, like, the battery lasts for hours, right?

1108
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:10,070
Speaker 1: It's not really a problem most of the time.

1109
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:16,810
Speaker 1: But I was recording Netrunner videos and each round is an hour, or at least unless you play fast, right?

1110
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:22,790
Speaker 1: And, you know, you're using a battery, maybe round one the batteries- Well, you don't have a bandolier of batteries.

1111
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:27,070
Speaker 1: Even if you have a bandolier of batteries, I can't stop in the middle of a game to change the battery.

1112
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:30,370
Speaker 0: No, you have the bandolier that self-powers through that special weird-ass cable.

1113
00:58:31,191 --> 00:58:31,532
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

1114
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:36,005
Speaker 1: There's no way to apply power to that old camera, right?

1115
00:58:36,366 --> 00:58:37,650
Speaker 1: Except through the battery holes.

1116
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:41,223
Speaker 1: It doesn't have, like, an AC or DC input hole on it, right?

1117
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:43,210
Speaker 1: Like a camcorder does or anything.

1118
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:47,570
Speaker 1: And, you know, you recharge the batteries by taking them out of the camera and putting them in a charger.

1119
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:55,990
Speaker 1: So, basically, even if you only use, like, three quarters of a battery, that extra quarter is basically now useless to you because you can't record a full game on it.

1120
00:58:56,070 --> 00:59:00,362
Speaker 1: If you try to use that power to record a game, the camera will run out mid-game.

1121
00:59:00,382 --> 00:59:02,950
Speaker 1: You'll have to stop, change the battery, and start again.

1122
00:59:03,712 --> 00:59:05,550
Speaker 1: Even if your memory card is gigantic, no good.

1123
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,130
Speaker 0: My camcorder has a special battery that's basically just an interface to the battery ports.

1124
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,130
Speaker 0: And then that has a cable that goes down to a bandolier of batteries.

1125
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:19,050
Speaker 1: So, the newer camera, right, you can buy this thing, which is exactly that.

1126
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,236
Speaker 1: It's a fake battery.

1127
00:59:20,377 --> 00:59:22,469
Speaker 1: It's in the shape of a battery with a wire coming out.

1128
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:28,570
Speaker 1: And the camera even has a little flappy bit so that the wire can escape the battery hole and stick out of the camera.

1129
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,530
Speaker 1: Separately, they sell an AC adapter that plugs into that.

1130
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,770
Speaker 1: They don't provide them in a package, even though one is useless without the other.

1131
00:59:36,433 --> 00:59:38,730
Speaker 1: I don't know why, but they don't.

1132
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:45,427
Speaker 1: So, in the instruction manual, it says, "Don't use any AC adapter except this AC10

1133
00:59:45,467 --> 00:59:45,508
Speaker 1: PP."

1134
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:51,590
Speaker 1: And don't use any battery, you know, plug thingy except the DC whatever number, right?

1135
00:59:52,095 --> 00:59:53,490
Speaker 1: So, I tried to get those model numbers.

1136
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:58,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, once you go pro, very specific model numbers of things mean a lot to you.

1137
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:05,870
Speaker 1: So, I go and I finally B&H'd and miraculously they had the fake battery bit, but they didn't have an AC adapter.

1138
01:00:06,751 --> 01:00:10,147
Speaker 1: How do they order a not equal number of both products?

1139
01:00:10,227 --> 01:00:10,770
Speaker 1: I do not know.

1140
01:00:11,591 --> 01:00:13,930
Speaker 1: So, I go searching on the internet for the AC adapter.

1141
01:00:15,071 --> 01:00:17,450
Speaker 1: No one has it, except like some Japanese places.

1142
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,248
Speaker 1: And it's like, "Wow, are they just not selling this

1143
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:20,429
Speaker 1: here?".

1144
01:00:20,671 --> 01:00:20,935
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1145
01:00:21,665 --> 01:00:21,989
Speaker 1: Well, here.

1146
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:27,509
Speaker 1: But then I noticed the GH3 had the exact same batteries as the GH4.

1147
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:35,109
Speaker 1: It had the exact same DC coupling bit, but it had a different AC adapter, the AC8, not the AC10.

1148
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:40,688
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Huh, why wouldn't the AC8 work in the same as the AC10

1149
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:41,170
Speaker 1: does?".

1150
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:50,403
Speaker 1: I mean, clearly they've changed the product, but this takes the same batteries as that camera and the same DC coupler and the same everything.

1151
01:00:50,463 --> 01:00:52,210
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't it use the same, right?

1152
01:00:52,771 --> 01:00:55,309
Speaker 1: So, I decided to take a risk for the internets.

1153
01:00:56,010 --> 01:01:01,290
Speaker 1: I went and I bought the Wasabi batteries meant for the GH3, the third-party batteries, and I stuck them in there.

1154
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,296
Speaker 1: Camera could have exploded.

1155
01:01:02,941 --> 01:01:03,526
Speaker 1: Didn't explode.

1156
01:01:03,546 --> 01:01:04,030
Speaker 1: They worked great.

1157
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:08,650
Speaker 1: And that made me think, "Aha, it is exactly the same as the GH3, isn't

1158
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:08,710
Speaker 1: it?".

1159
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:09,648
Speaker 1: And they're trying to bullshit me.

1160
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:13,568
Speaker 1: So, then I found another camera store in the city and they had the AC8.

1161
01:01:14,354 --> 01:01:15,262
Speaker 1: They had one left.

1162
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:16,009
Speaker 1: And I got it.

1163
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:21,910
Speaker 1: And I was in the store and I'm like, "Let me plug this into my camera before I buy it from you.

1164
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,059
Speaker 1: If my camera explodes, that's on me.

1165
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:25,466
Speaker 1: I'll just get the warranty or whatever.

1166
01:01:25,647 --> 01:01:26,310
Speaker 1: I'll find a way.

1167
01:01:26,993 --> 01:01:28,207
Speaker 1: If it doesn't explode, I'm buying

1168
01:01:28,247 --> 01:01:28,368
Speaker 1: this.".

1169
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,685
Speaker 1: And of course, it didn't explode.

1170
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:31,390
Speaker 1: It totally worked.

1171
01:01:31,796 --> 01:01:32,070
Speaker 0: Alright.

1172
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,583
Speaker 1: So, I can now plug the camera into the wall.

1173
01:01:34,623 --> 01:01:35,690
Speaker 1: Something you would think is so simple.

1174
01:01:36,371 --> 01:01:40,890
Speaker 1: Plug your camera into the wall so you can take video until the memory card is full without stopping indoors.

1175
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:42,179
Speaker 1: You think that would be basic.

1176
01:01:42,219 --> 01:01:43,689
Speaker 1: Like, the camera would just fucking come with that.

1177
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:44,591
Speaker 1: But no.

1178
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:46,519
Speaker 1: Pro shit just doesn't come with that.

1179
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:48,627
Speaker 1: The same as the stupid wireless mics.

1180
01:01:48,687 --> 01:01:49,350
Speaker 1: It just doesn't.

1181
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:49,923
Speaker 1: You have to...

1182
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:50,331
Speaker 0: Yup.

1183
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:50,854
Speaker 0: Well, here.

1184
01:01:50,895 --> 01:01:53,310
Speaker 0: Let's configure an E6 Countryman right now.

1185
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,278
Speaker 1: Something so simple.

1186
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,510
Speaker 1: Just plugging it into the wall.

1187
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:55,771
Speaker 0: Alright.

1188
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:57,680
Speaker 0: So, what are we plugging our fucking microphone into?

1189
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,690
Speaker 0: There's a dropdown with like a hundred options.

1190
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:00,175
Speaker 1: Whoa.

1191
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:01,193
Speaker 0: Let's say,

1192
01:02:01,374 --> 01:02:01,715
Speaker 0: "Sure.".

1193
01:02:01,775 --> 01:02:04,830
Speaker 0: And all the other options you get change depending on what you pick here.

1194
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:05,990
Speaker 1: It's like filling out your taxes.

1195
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:06,513
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say,

1196
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:06,975
Speaker 0: "Sure.".

1197
01:02:06,995 --> 01:02:08,503
Speaker 0: Oh, now I gotta pick a model.

1198
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:09,830
Speaker 0: Let's go with the ULXP.

1199
01:02:10,714 --> 01:02:11,058
Speaker 0: Alright.

1200
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:11,990
Speaker 0: Flexibility.

1201
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,270
Speaker 1: That's the one with the group scan, right?

1202
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:13,591
Speaker 0: Yes.

1203
01:02:13,872 --> 01:02:14,435
Speaker 0: Flexibility.

1204
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:15,500
Speaker 0: There are three codes here.

1205
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:17,590
Speaker 0: No code for a classy springy boom.

1206
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,716
Speaker 0: I for a very flexible boom.

1207
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:23,050
Speaker 0: Or X for a flexible boom and a springy ear section.

1208
01:02:23,691 --> 01:02:26,970
Speaker 0: And then paragraphs of description of what each one of these is.

1209
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,857
Speaker 1: So why would you even need one or the other, right?

1210
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:31,970
Speaker 1: This is the boom that goes from the ear to your face, right?

1211
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:36,490
Speaker 1: You would want one that is where you can bend it and it stays in the shape that you bend it to.

1212
01:02:36,832 --> 01:02:36,933
Speaker 0: Ah.

1213
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:38,061
Speaker 0: So here's the explanation.

1214
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:39,250
Speaker 0: Just to give you an example.

1215
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:43,850
Speaker 0: The classic E6 is a good choice when one person alone will wear the microphone.

1216
01:02:44,451 --> 01:02:45,240
Speaker 0: It holds its shape.

1217
01:02:45,301 --> 01:02:45,989
Speaker 0: Just put it on and go.

1218
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:54,890
Speaker 0: The eye is highly flexible with the larger silicone rubber piece to use when multiple people share the mic and you have to reconfigure it on the fly for different people.

1219
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:58,050
Speaker 1: Oh, so the first one you reshape it and it stays in that shape forever?

1220
01:02:58,352 --> 01:02:58,730
Speaker 0: Basically.

1221
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:01,170
Speaker 1: The other one you can keep reshaping a bunch.

1222
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:04,029
Speaker 0: And then the flex is a compromise between those two.

1223
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:07,290
Speaker 0: For like theater, you might have to fuck with it occasionally.

1224
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:12,830
Speaker 1: Sure, the first one you can shape it once and leave it that shape forever.

1225
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:14,010
Speaker 1: You can reshape it.

1226
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:16,188
Speaker 1: But why not just get the reshaping one always?

1227
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:20,870
Speaker 0: Because the reshaping one will possibly lose its shape over the course of doing something.

1228
01:03:21,392 --> 01:03:23,569
Speaker 0: And you have to refit it to your head every time you put it on.

1229
01:03:24,191 --> 01:03:25,630
Speaker 1: Oh, it sort of loses its shape.

1230
01:03:25,911 --> 01:03:27,350
Speaker 0: The classic, like you do a thing and then it's set.

1231
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:29,490
Speaker 1: The other one is really firm and stays that way forever.

1232
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,315
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1233
01:03:30,335 --> 01:03:32,389
Speaker 0: It stays that way for as long as you need it to.

1234
01:03:33,192 --> 01:03:34,819
Speaker 1: But it can be reshaped.

1235
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,568
Speaker 1: But if you reshape it too much, it's going to break?

1236
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:37,581
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1237
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,902
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not get just that one always?

1238
01:03:39,922 --> 01:03:41,010
Speaker 1: Or the compromise one?

1239
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:46,130
Speaker 0: So what if you own it for a venue where you have a different person speaking every night?

1240
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:54,770
Speaker 1: If that firm one can be reshaped a bunch without breaking and it holds its shape once I shape it, why not use that one?

1241
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:55,978
Speaker 0: It's not easy to shape.

1242
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,810
Speaker 0: I watch videos on how to shape it.

1243
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:58,317
Speaker 1: It's not just like you.

1244
01:03:58,337 --> 01:03:59,269
Speaker 1: don't just bend it and that's it?

1245
01:03:59,611 --> 01:03:59,692
Speaker 0: No.

1246
01:03:59,732 --> 01:04:03,490
Speaker 0: You like flex and pull and the idea is that you make it perfect for one person.

1247
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,429
Speaker 0: Leave it that way forever.

1248
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:04,990
Speaker 0: Alright.

1249
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:05,963
Speaker 0: That's what it's aimed for.

1250
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,001
Speaker 1: Because that matters that much, right?

1251
01:04:08,042 --> 01:04:09,250
Speaker 1: If it's a little bit out of place.

1252
01:04:09,874 --> 01:04:11,290
Speaker 0: At these volumes, it kind of does.

1253
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:12,596
Speaker 0: So pattern.

1254
01:04:12,717 --> 01:04:13,990
Speaker 0: Omnidirectional or directional?

1255
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:17,650
Speaker 1: Well, it's always being worn on someone's head pointing at their mouth.

1256
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:20,490
Speaker 1: So why wouldn't you always want it to point straight at the mouth and that's it?

1257
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:23,550
Speaker 0: Well, usually actually you want omnidirectional for these things.

1258
01:04:23,933 --> 01:04:24,259
Speaker 1: Okay.

1259
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:24,829
Speaker 1: Why is that?

1260
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,901
Speaker 0: Because it's usually not pointed at your mouth.

1261
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:28,169
Speaker 0: It's just near your mouth.

1262
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:31,570
Speaker 0: And omnidirectionals don't fuck with the sound.

1263
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:34,410
Speaker 0: Directional microphones actually do fuck with your sound a little bit.

1264
01:04:35,093 --> 01:04:38,330
Speaker 0: And they also, if they get a little out of place, now you're fucked.

1265
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:41,910
Speaker 1: Why would you then ever want the directional one?

1266
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:45,930
Speaker 0: So you and me on a stage, we probably want omnis because it's just us talking.

1267
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:50,830
Speaker 0: What if we're on a stage singing with Britney Spears and there's tons of noise on stage?

1268
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:52,190
Speaker 0: Then we need a directional.

1269
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:56,510
Speaker 1: Oh, so that the guitars jamming and such don't go into the microphones?

1270
01:04:58,410 --> 01:04:58,810
Speaker 1: Alright.

1271
01:04:59,471 --> 01:05:01,266
Speaker 0: And then there's all these different types of directionality.

1272
01:05:01,286 --> 01:05:01,770
Speaker 0: We'll skip all that.

1273
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:02,410
Speaker 0: We'll go with the omni.

1274
01:05:02,992 --> 01:05:04,377
Speaker 0: So, sensitivity.

1275
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:07,890
Speaker 0: Three of the options are grayed out because of the options we chose earlier.

1276
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:09,981
Speaker 0: We can choose the W5, W6, or W7.

1277
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:19,210
Speaker 0: Standard gain for general speaking, moderate gain for speaking and vocals, or powerful vocals.

1278
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,440
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's basically how much...

1279
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:25,270
Speaker 0: How sensitive is this thing before it just blows out?

1280
01:05:25,613 --> 01:05:25,720
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1281
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:28,648
Speaker 0: So, it appears that we need the W6.

1282
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,529
Speaker 1: We would get the more sensitive one.

1283
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:32,549
Speaker 0: Not the most sensitive one, though.

1284
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:34,450
Speaker 1: What's the most sensitive one?

1285
01:05:34,635 --> 01:05:34,830
Speaker 1: Standard.

1286
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,990
Speaker 1: That's the one where you whisper?

1287
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,350
Speaker 0: No, standard gain for general speaking.

1288
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:45,128
Speaker 0: The advice, and again, there's tons of advice here, it basically says standard spoken word, W5.

1289
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:50,628
Speaker 0: Musical theater or, and I'm stressing this, dynamic presenters, W6.

1290
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:54,588
Speaker 0: Considering I'm yelling into this microphone right now, I think we need W6s.

1291
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:56,502
Speaker 0: It warns you, W7.

1292
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,990
Speaker 1: But if we're too quiet, if we just sit and have a chat, maybe we won't get heard.

1293
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:02,769
Speaker 0: Well, it means we have to pump the gain up, it'll be a little noisier then.

1294
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:10,690
Speaker 0: But that's probably better than blowing it out by being too loud for the thing when we start yelling in the middle of a panel.

1295
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:11,250
Speaker 0: That's true.

1296
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:15,190
Speaker 0: W7, basically, it's like only fucking use this if this is opera.

1297
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:16,841
Speaker 1: If you're yelling, then you'll maybe get to move.

1298
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:22,990
Speaker 0: Not even yelling, it says opera singer or other extremely loud applications only.

1299
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:27,450
Speaker 1: In other words, if we put those on and we start doing a podcast, we won't even move the needle.

1300
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:27,940
Speaker 0: Yup.

1301
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:29,675
Speaker 0: Alright, color.

1302
01:06:29,776 --> 01:06:32,170
Speaker 0: Light beige, tan, cocoa, or black.

1303
01:06:32,591 --> 01:06:34,510
Speaker 1: I guess that's because you care about hiding it, right?

1304
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:36,129
Speaker 1: But we don't really care about hiding it so much.

1305
01:06:37,473 --> 01:06:39,909
Speaker 1: The fact that it's so small, it's already hidden enough for us.

1306
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:46,390
Speaker 1: We're not honest, in theater, trying to really hide it when we're doing something really classical.

1307
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:46,699
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1308
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:50,730
Speaker 1: So we would just get, I guess, the white person color.

1309
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:53,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, well it's interesting because they give you a lot of notes.

1310
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:57,790
Speaker 1: And it's like, you're going to see, even if I get white person color, it's like facial hairs and stuff.

1311
01:06:57,790 --> 01:07:02,090
Speaker 0: Well, they warn you, for example, for placement against skin, when in doubt, choose the darker option.

1312
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:05,950
Speaker 0: Lighter colors on camera look like scars from a distance.

1313
01:07:06,331 --> 01:07:08,670
Speaker 1: Right, plus my beardedness and whatnot, right?

1314
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:12,490
Speaker 0: Or we just go black and then it's obvious it's there, but it's kind of techno future.

1315
01:07:13,257 --> 01:07:13,928
Speaker 1: I like black too.

1316
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:15,950
Speaker 0: Alright, cable diameter, one millimeter.

1317
01:07:17,011 --> 01:07:21,349
Speaker 1: And the solid black is not racially insensitive if anyone has to use it.

1318
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:22,968
Speaker 0: Albinos.

1319
01:07:23,892 --> 01:07:24,589
Speaker 1: Sorry, albinos.

1320
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:25,470
Speaker 0: Racist.

1321
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:26,710
Speaker 0: There is a white option.

1322
01:07:28,233 --> 01:07:29,110
Speaker 0: Stark pearl white.

1323
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:30,029
Speaker 1: Way to go, Canyon.

1324
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,250
Speaker 1: That's actually, no, that looks like a scar.

1325
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:33,349
Speaker 1: Anyway, keep going.

1326
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:34,309
Speaker 0: Unless you're an albino.

1327
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:35,588
Speaker 1: Go albinos, go.

1328
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,969
Speaker 0: Also, that one can be colored with felt tip pens.

1329
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:41,550
Speaker 1: Dude, somewhere there's the awesomest albino nerdy person ever.

1330
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:42,067
Speaker 0: There has to be.

1331
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:44,650
Speaker 0: Dude, if any albinos listen to Geek Night, totally talk to us.

1332
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:47,930
Speaker 1: And they're doing all the cosplays that no one else can do and everyone is mad jelly.

1333
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:50,610
Speaker 0: Name a character they can do other than Ray Iannami.

1334
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:53,970
Speaker 1: Someone who's like really, really white.

1335
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:57,829
Speaker 1: Dylan Dow from Escaflownia is really white.

1336
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:58,687
Speaker 0: That kind of works.

1337
01:07:59,330 --> 01:07:59,525
Speaker 0: Let's see.

1338
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:00,590
Speaker 0: Alright, one more option.

1339
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:01,288
Speaker 1: Various ghosts.

1340
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,710
Speaker 0: Do we want the one millimeter.

1341
01:08:03,471 --> 01:08:04,809
Speaker 1: Vampires of various sorts.

1342
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:09,510
Speaker 0: The one millimeter Eremid reinforced cable or the two millimeter Duramax.

1343
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:11,070
Speaker 1: We're not the Duramax cable.

1344
01:08:12,216 --> 01:08:13,410
Speaker 1: We're not trying to hide the cable.

1345
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:14,570
Speaker 1: We are buying an expensive.

1346
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:18,450
Speaker 0: The Duramax cable provides 50 additional pounds of tensile strength.

1347
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:21,390
Speaker 1: Right, we are buying an expensive thing we do not want to break.

1348
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,288
Speaker 1: We are not buying a thing we are trying to hide.

1349
01:08:25,171 --> 01:08:26,979
Speaker 0: Our sku is an E60W62SL.

1350
01:08:29,831 --> 01:08:30,569
Speaker 1: How much is it?

1351
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:32,755
Speaker 1: So $1,000 for two.

1352
01:08:33,974 --> 01:08:34,130
Speaker 0: Yes.

1353
01:08:34,812 --> 01:08:36,450
Speaker 0: And that won't work with the Marantz.

1354
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:37,826
Speaker 0: Fuck.

1355
01:08:41,894 --> 01:08:43,429
Speaker 0: So guys, don't go pro.

1356
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:47,109
Speaker 1: Couldn't we get something that it can work with that goes in between it and the Marantz?

1357
01:08:48,515 --> 01:08:49,410
Speaker 0: A wireless system.

1358
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:50,870
Speaker 1: Right, the wireless outputs into the Marantz.

1359
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,069
Speaker 0: Yes, that's what we would do.

1360
01:08:52,393 --> 01:08:53,868
Speaker 0: We would always use the wireless system.

1361
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,109
Speaker 0: Assuming that we broadcast on a legal channel, the laws don't change.

1362
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:02,370
Speaker 1: But couldn't we connect it to those little wireless backpack thingies, the gauntlet belt clip?

1363
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,990
Speaker 1: And then couldn't we have a wire coming out of that?

1364
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,430
Speaker 0: Those things usually don't have a local output wire.

1365
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:08,689
Speaker 1: Couldn't we find one that does?

1366
01:09:09,254 --> 01:09:10,630
Speaker 0: I don't know of one, to be honest.

1367
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:11,849
Speaker 1: Couldn't we make one?

1368
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:18,029
Speaker 0: Now there are devices I've found that I have not vetted that will give the proper voltage to this thing and convert to XLR.

1369
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:20,410
Speaker 0: But I've got to do a little bit of research on those.

1370
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:23,790
Speaker 1: You don't want to explode your $500 thing, even though I almost exploded my $700 camera.

1371
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:24,906
Speaker 0: No, because here's the other thing.

1372
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:32,930
Speaker 0: With professional equipment, if you go back to the store and you're like, "Yeah, it just stopped working," they can figure out exactly what you did to it.

1373
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:34,069
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.

1374
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,670
Speaker 0: That is not the case with consumer and prosumer stuff.

1375
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,024
Speaker 0: No.

1376
01:09:37,531 --> 01:09:38,166
Speaker 0: Except cell phones.

1377
01:09:39,294 --> 01:09:40,609
Speaker 0: They know if you dropped it in the toilet.

1378
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:41,188
Speaker 1: Yep.

1379
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:48,410
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1380
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:53,550
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1381
01:09:53,911 --> 01:09:58,950
Speaker 1: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1382
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:01,870
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1383
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:06,630
Speaker 0: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1385
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:14,450
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1386
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,570
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
