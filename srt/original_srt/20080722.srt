1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,662
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, July 22nd.

2
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:11,424
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:14,348
Speaker 0: I'm Rip and this is Geek Nights!

4
00:00:14,408 --> 00:00:15,830
Speaker 0: Tonight, Mega Man!

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:19,595
Speaker 1: *sings to the music*.

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,530
Speaker 0: Seeing as tribes 2 is indisputably the greatest FPS of all time, but the game died.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,229
Speaker 0: You know, best game till they fucked it up.

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,849
Speaker 0: We've been trying to get a game on, but it's not that easy considering that all the official servers are down and it's a big.

10
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:51,476
Speaker 0: you know the technology is old and you got to get a copy of the game and the keys and the patches and the whole.

11
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:52,281
Speaker 0: it's a big mess it's.

12
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:55,838
Speaker 0: you know even though it's the best game ever it's very hard to get it working.

13
00:00:55,938 --> 00:01:03,990
Speaker 0: so in my desire to play some FPS action I resorted to playing the second best FPS ever natural selection and hot.

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:12,050
Speaker 0: then playing the second best FPS ever which is actually very easy to play because there's plenty of servers and plenty of people playing all the time.

15
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:12,694
Speaker 0: it just works.

16
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:13,700
Speaker 0: it's a half-life 1 mod.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,827
Speaker 0: it just works and it's free.

18
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,299
Speaker 0: and it's everyone has half-life 1. everyone has steam.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,163
Speaker 0: it's easy to.

20
00:01:18,223 --> 00:01:27,199
Speaker 0: so playing NS the second best game FPS game but it's easy to play is better than struggling to play an inadequate game of tribes 2.

21
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:32,040
Speaker 0: I mean if I could get a real game of tribes 2 on NS would be ignored.

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,008
Speaker 0: but seeing as that is very difficult and NS is very easy and has got played see I'd kind of as much as I love NS.

23
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:47,491
Speaker 1: I kind of about it because once I had tribes installed I realized that playing tribes alone with like 18 bots is more fun than playing pretty much any other FPS with people.

24
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:49,501
Speaker 0: it's not more fun than that ass.

25
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:50,807
Speaker 1: well the thing is NS.

26
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:54,185
Speaker 1: yeah only if you can get a good game on and there's like what two servers.

27
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,714
Speaker 1: so if they're both full what are you gonna do?

28
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:56,943
Speaker 0: I've had no trouble.

29
00:01:57,024 --> 00:02:04,370
Speaker 0: actually I've had a little bit of trouble getting into him but I just sort of refresh a little bit and I wait for someone to drop out and I get right in and then I'm I stay in and it's good.

30
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:06,700
Speaker 0: but in my playing NS it was.

31
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:08,247
Speaker 0: I didn't get anything else done.

32
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:09,714
Speaker 0: I just played a whole bunch of NS.

33
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:12,366
Speaker 1: see I didn't play so much NS because I knew better.

34
00:02:12,407 --> 00:02:12,708
Speaker 1: I knew that.

35
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:14,395
Speaker 0: yeah you played Civ 4 instead.

36
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,344
Speaker 1: yeah but I play Civ 4 on the train.

37
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:17,770
Speaker 1: uh-huh I only play.

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,467
Speaker 1: I've only played Civ 4 at home once in recent memory.

39
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:23,638
Speaker 1: that was when I was playing online with the rest of the crew.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,106
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter I am a man in a desert and NS has provided is like an oasis and it was quite refreshing.

41
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:38,063
Speaker 0: and I even the last game I played on Sunday night was like one of the best games NS ever played around the Tanith map and you know that met.

42
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:38,464
Speaker 0: you're in that.

43
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:39,550
Speaker 0: the were the Marines.

44
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:56,145
Speaker 0: the marine base room has the two doors and the two walls and there's the the resource tower between them and everyone stands up on that computer console and the aliens come in and they're bio bomb in the RT and you can't get out and you just make this crazy last stand every time because it's so great.

45
00:02:56,205 --> 00:03:03,641
Speaker 0: but see we played that and we were at the last stand in the marine base and I was like oh man this is the end just like always.

46
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:04,545
Speaker 0: and it felt again.

47
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:07,378
Speaker 0: that classic feeling of this is how it always goes.

48
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:08,322
Speaker 0: this is how it should be.

49
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:14,876
Speaker 0: but one key difference was that we actually had one of the hives locked down it's pretty much the base and one hive.

50
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:18,413
Speaker 0: but that hive was locked down with seizures and turrets and everything.

51
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:33,570
Speaker 0: so what actually ended up happening is because of our phase gates because of our excellent commander and because of people actually listening to the commander he slowly gave out weapons as we built up the resources for our two resource towers and he said if you have a weapon don't go anywhere.

52
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:36,244
Speaker 0: and most people actually didn't go anywhere.

53
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:40,026
Speaker 0: they just stayed in the base and they stayed in the hive and we defended from the alien.

54
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:40,609
Speaker 1: that's crazy.

55
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:41,855
Speaker 1: no one ever follows orders.

56
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:44,467
Speaker 0: we stated we defended from the aliens.

57
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:49,087
Speaker 0: just constantly rushing and bile bombing for a good must have been like five to ten minutes.

58
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:55,420
Speaker 0: and what actually happened was even though we had so few resource towers the aliens had so many because we actually killed Onos.

59
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,087
Speaker 0: is that you kill an Onos at 75 res?

60
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:00,039
Speaker 0: it takes a few minutes for that to build back up.

61
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:04,421
Speaker 0: so after we were able to actually drain them of resources.

62
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:08,641
Speaker 0: but meanwhile we didn't have that many resource or a good rate of resource increase.

63
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:13,080
Speaker 0: but we had saved up so we actually had more power than they did.

64
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,071
Speaker 0: we had jet packs and HMGs and grenade launchers.

65
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:24,098
Speaker 1: see it definitely sounds like it was a case of very organized and resilient Marines coupled with good commander and mediocre aliens.

66
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:26,088
Speaker 0: well the aliens were good but they didn't.

67
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:31,154
Speaker 0: they didn't have the resolve that the Marines had and slowly but surely we dominated the entire map.

68
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:31,515
Speaker 0: and it was.

69
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:35,074
Speaker 0: it took a good 15 to 20 minutes to conquer back everything.

70
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:39,834
Speaker 0: I think the entire game was over half hour but ah that was that was.

71
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:42,705
Speaker 0: that wasn't just water refreshing the parched man in the desert.

72
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,273
Speaker 0: that was something more.

73
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:47,326
Speaker 0: I guess there's nothing more refreshing than water.

74
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:56,328
Speaker 1: you know we're still working toward having a tribe server that we can all play on in the front row crew and we'll teach you guys about what FPS is used to be like.

75
00:04:56,368 --> 00:05:00,831
Speaker 1: but in the meantime it's much more likely that we can all just play NS together.

76
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:02,279
Speaker 1: I think we tried once before.

77
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:12,970
Speaker 0: we tried once to teach NS right so we actually got like six listeners and us on a server however however but it was a public server so we're gonna make our own server but our computers suck.

78
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:17,152
Speaker 1: we didn't have a public IP and we just gave up right away and just decided to pick some empty server.

79
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:24,006
Speaker 1: and there must be a lot of people who go to play NS and just watch for a server that isn't full because well isn't empty.

80
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:26,014
Speaker 1: well isn't full or empty.

81
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:30,333
Speaker 1: yeah look for a server with people that isn't full that's not bots yeah.

82
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:35,700
Speaker 0: so as soon as people saw that our server had like seven non bots on it they all came rushing in the best.

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,229
Speaker 0: suddenly this one dude out.

84
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:44,368
Speaker 1: I was on my team I'm in the aliens and we're just kind of playing and this guy in the voice chat just start saying what the fuck everyone sucks.

85
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:45,936
Speaker 1: why won't anyone build anything?

86
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:47,323
Speaker 1: why don't we have any RTS?

87
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:48,508
Speaker 1: I'm the breeds one.

88
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,279
Speaker 1: yet I'm like the Marines suck - it's like what's going on.

89
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,834
Speaker 0: that's what we get for trying to do a private learning tutorial game on a public server but we're just gonna have to run our own.

90
00:05:57,854 --> 00:06:00,649
Speaker 1: sir I think imagine we want to make all the listeners be Marines.

91
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:03,322
Speaker 0: yes you got to teach one side at a time.

92
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,815
Speaker 1: yes so you start coaching them and then I'm an alien.

93
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:10,694
Speaker 1: I walk in I'm like and you're like this is a skulk and I walk in as a skulk.

94
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:18,552
Speaker 0: observe the skulk observe what it does to hungry Joe over there and they do the same thing when everyone's the aliens a marine walks in he go this is a marine.

95
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:25,289
Speaker 0: but yeah I think that problem was he gave whoever was playing that game a bad impression was because they suck so much.

96
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:26,978
Speaker 0: but the other you know people came in.

97
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:28,225
Speaker 0: we're actually trying to play a game.

98
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:39,393
Speaker 0: they had to actually just sort of order them around and it became for the people who didn't know what they were doing a follow orders game which is certainly not because if you know what you're doing you don't need someone to tell you what to do all the time.

99
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:53,271
Speaker 1: well at the same time actually like when I first played NS and I was bad at it what I liked more than anything was the fact that I was given orders to follow because it's kind of like when you play tie fighter you like in a game where you get on ambiguous orders and following them is a good thing.

100
00:06:53,472 --> 00:07:00,892
Speaker 1: yeah you feel good when you don't know what to do and you don't understand anything and this voice from above gives you a welder and says go weld that thing.

101
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:03,163
Speaker 1: these two guys will protect you while you do it.

102
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:05,072
Speaker 0: yeah we have to learn how to follow.

103
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:08,427
Speaker 0: you know you get you got to do the trip boot camp before you do that.

104
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:12,583
Speaker 0: yeah if someone's yelling go to instead of.

105
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:17,347
Speaker 0: I didn't send you to boot camp in the real military just sent you straight to Iraq and then they started telling you what to do you like.

106
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:21,423
Speaker 0: oh god it sucks is the worst thing ever.

107
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,695
Speaker 1: if you want to place a man ask with us.

108
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:28,896
Speaker 1: sadly I don't know how much I'll be playing until I don't know September.

109
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:31,210
Speaker 0: I'm not probably gonna be playing much until September either.

110
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,005
Speaker 0: I mean you know starting now I really got you know shit to do.

111
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:38,586
Speaker 0: yeah con season is pretty much used up my last gas to play at us.

112
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,399
Speaker 1: yeah but come this winter we're gonna be playing some NS.

113
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,441
Speaker 1: so if you want to get your groove on ahead of time head over to guns for back to school.

114
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:47,888
Speaker 1: the best little NS server.

115
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,455
Speaker 0: yeah there's that server.

116
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:50,661
Speaker 0: guns for back to school.

117
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:51,325
Speaker 1: that is bad.

118
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:54,482
Speaker 0: the server I play on the most that if I can get in it's always full.

119
00:07:54,583 --> 00:08:01,154
Speaker 1: that server was awesome when we first found out about NS back at RIT and it is been awesome continuously until this day.

120
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:05,574
Speaker 0: those people also run TF 2 servers for you people who still play TF 2 even though it's no good.

121
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:07,343
Speaker 1: oh god TF 2 yeah.

122
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,934
Speaker 0: but guns for back to school is good people.

123
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:11,408
Speaker 0: they have pretty much the best FPS servers there are.

124
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:14,342
Speaker 1: I think NS has some of the best FPS community there is.

125
00:08:14,382 --> 00:08:15,146
Speaker 0: well that's the other thing.

126
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:16,112
Speaker 0: you play NS right.

127
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:17,359
Speaker 0: it's a complicated game.

128
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,322
Speaker 0: it's not easy to understand if you're not you know hardcore there's a lot of things to learn.

129
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:27,691
Speaker 0: it doesn't have the best user interface but because it's such an old game there's not a lot of new players.

130
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:35,533
Speaker 0: everyone in there is really experienced and everyone in there actually cares about the game and it's a serious game and you're not gonna find a lot of schmucks.

131
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:42,047
Speaker 0: you know going like in counter-strike where it's just like oh it's your mom you suck faggot know something loud and you die.

132
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,152
Speaker 0: fuck you does.

133
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:44,439
Speaker 0: that shit doesn't happen so bad.

134
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:52,093
Speaker 0: you get a lot of like just although we've talked it's not super mature but people are in there actually playing the game somewhat seriously.

135
00:08:52,113 --> 00:09:03,924
Speaker 1: not only that it's more than what like when you know you've lost or won a lot of times funny things just because there's a certain etiquette to playing NS that is separate from the how to win of NS.

136
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:05,691
Speaker 0: it's sort of like.

137
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:05,972
Speaker 0: you know.

138
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:12,609
Speaker 0: you remember in the early days of natural selection when the people were losing and it was pretty much a foregone conclusion that you were gonna lose.

139
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,200
Speaker 0: you would push f4 to go to the ready room.

140
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,003
Speaker 0: the game be over.

141
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:20,328
Speaker 0: now that you don't do that anymore that's that's a faux pas if you push f4 to go to the ready room.

142
00:09:20,348 --> 00:09:21,656
Speaker 0: in fact many servers won't let you.

143
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:30,314
Speaker 0: instead when you're done pretty much what you do is you recycle everything and you hide and you try to survive for as long as you can just hiding.

144
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:41,249
Speaker 1: and it's you know what I've had some good times being a gorge with three defense towers hiding an event somewhere for ten minutes and the reason you know you might sound really stupid like you've already lost.

145
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,320
Speaker 0: why not just go die and end it quickly?

146
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,433
Speaker 0: right but no hiding is something it's it's like.

147
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,980
Speaker 0: it's something you must do.

148
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,477
Speaker 0: it's sort of like those people in as much as I hated them.

149
00:09:51,658 --> 00:10:00,145
Speaker 0: you know even though they were doing the same thing when we were playing that Jedi Knight 2 and people would have the duals they would always bow and I would just stab them and win.

150
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:04,362
Speaker 0: well that was part of the etiquette too yeah and that the thing is is like.

151
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:06,816
Speaker 0: for some reason I didn't like that Jedi Knight etiquette.

152
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:07,801
Speaker 0: I just stabbed people.

153
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:16,350
Speaker 0: but in NS the etiquette of hiding at the end and you know doing a victory egg and stuff like that was all.

154
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,415
Speaker 0: there was something about that.

155
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:19,184
Speaker 0: that was I don't know I like better.

156
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:22,136
Speaker 1: yeah but this isn't a show about NS.

157
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:24,589
Speaker 1: we've done at least one show about NS.

158
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,266
Speaker 0: we also did a show on BattleTech which you were gonna do a show on today.

159
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:28,474
Speaker 0: then I was like oh shit we did a show.

160
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:29,481
Speaker 1: I was excited about that.

161
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,397
Speaker 1: I feel like we should just do a BattleTech show again.

162
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:32,967
Speaker 1: I might say different things I don't know.

163
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:34,778
Speaker 0: I had to listen to the old BattleTech show.

164
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:40,051
Speaker 1: I guess I hope I mentioned that Scott always makes very ineffectual mechs that are covered in nothing but small lasers.

165
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,822
Speaker 0: I think you did mention that in the original battle.

166
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,108
Speaker 1: I mentioned that like every day.

167
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:46,403
Speaker 0: yes oh just one side note here really quick.

168
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:51,022
Speaker 0: there were some rules of the World of Warcraft miniatures game on their website.

169
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:56,483
Speaker 1: oh yeah these are the rules that they would not tell us about when we were press.

170
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:05,312
Speaker 0: I looked at the rules not so not so well considering you can take a look and judge for yourself but the rules that I've seen.

171
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,558
Speaker 0: not so.

172
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:13,127
Speaker 1: when we walked up with our little press badges all they could tell us was look how shiny these miniatures are.

173
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,355
Speaker 1: look how realistic they are.

174
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:16,379
Speaker 0: they were shiny.

175
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,162
Speaker 1: look at these.

176
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:20,315
Speaker 0: these are that Pokemon miniatures game.

177
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:24,199
Speaker 0: that is the really good Pokemon miniatures and like if I could get like a spare tomb out of there.

178
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:24,823
Speaker 0: I totally would.

179
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:34,675
Speaker 0: but you know if I really if I like to World of Warcraft and I wanted to have some World of Warcraft creatures I would you know buy some individual minis but I don't have a lot of confidence in this game.

180
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:40,208
Speaker 1: but anyway some of you might be want thinking that we're about to talk about e3 but now there's nothing to say about e3.

181
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:41,215
Speaker 1: it was pretty lame.

182
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:42,987
Speaker 1: nothing important was announced and that's the.

183
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:45,622
Speaker 0: yeah I'm not even gonna do news on e3 because it was so bleh.

184
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:53,743
Speaker 1: I already talked about the Netflix Xbox you know the last week's yeah and people are making a buzz about all the lame stuff that happened at the Nintendo panel.

185
00:11:53,763 --> 00:12:00,737
Speaker 1: but eh eh is what I say also but I do want to talk about the fact that you know there's always more Castlevania games coming.

186
00:12:00,797 --> 00:12:02,123
Speaker 1: it's got like at any given point.

187
00:12:02,163 --> 00:12:19,680
Speaker 1: there's another but the two Castlevania games that have been announced there are clips for my link to one of them looks like more of the same thing and the other one looks really really really bad and I don't know why.

188
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:20,986
Speaker 1: why would they do this?

189
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:32,418
Speaker 0: I'm not really understanding what's been going on with the Castlevania like like licensed in Castlevania actually really illustrates something that we're gonna talk about in Scott's bit was the real news.

190
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:39,167
Speaker 1: yeah I'm gonna bring up because Castlevania really started floundering when it entered the 3d console world.

191
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:46,622
Speaker 0: I know they had this formula of 2d side scrolling whipping game right and in Castlevania 2 they added some weird shit that didn't go over that.

192
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,171
Speaker 0: well except for rim.

193
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:49,297
Speaker 0: who's the only person who loved it?

194
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:50,201
Speaker 0: hey can't fuck you.

195
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:52,672
Speaker 1: Castlevania 2 was the best NES.

196
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:53,395
Speaker 1: Castlevania.

197
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:55,343
Speaker 0: I guess it might have had the best music.

198
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:58,235
Speaker 1: Castlevania 3 was the second best.

199
00:12:58,296 --> 00:12:59,280
Speaker 0: first of all Castlevania.

200
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:07,449
Speaker 0: well everyone knows that that PlayStation 1 even though yeah everyone considers the PlayStation 1 with the Symphony of the Night right to be like the best one is the one I haven't played.

201
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:09,660
Speaker 0: I played all the other side scrolling.

202
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,625
Speaker 0: Castlevania is good.

203
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:18,019
Speaker 1: I haven't played the GBA ones but Chris I honestly Castlevania the night was a special case in that it was this confluence of.

204
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:30,489
Speaker 1: I mean for one that the music in that game that soundtrack was something that was unheard of in gaming at the time - in the era when suddenly 2d games disappeared and everything was 3d bullshit.

205
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:38,530
Speaker 1: someone made a good 2d game a really good 2d game yep which was the thing everyone had always been saying why don't you just make an awesome 2d game?

206
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:39,776
Speaker 0: I know it's it's people.

207
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:54,476
Speaker 0: they have a game and it's in a particular genre and then they have this need to like take that game license and put it in other things right and I guess it works for Mario but it doesn't really work for anything else.

208
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:57,489
Speaker 1: how long were people clamoring for a new 2d Mario?

209
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,569
Speaker 0: I know right we finally got one and it was okay but it was a little easy a little quick.

210
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:04,404
Speaker 1: yeah I was about to say a little easy a quick.

211
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:05,750
Speaker 0: yeah actually I try.

212
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,333
Speaker 0: I was.

213
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:08,764
Speaker 0: I was well on my way to getting all the big coins in that game.

214
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:10,070
Speaker 1: so it was.

215
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,235
Speaker 1: I realized I didn't care.

216
00:14:11,255 --> 00:14:13,868
Speaker 0: I also stopped carrying around like world 4.

217
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:30,257
Speaker 1: yeah the annoying part was not that I you know the coins were kind of hard to get all of them but the fact that I beat the entire game pretty much without trying and without really dying yeah as opposed to Mario 3 where I can't even beat that game half the time let alone.

218
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:38,195
Speaker 0: well I can pretty much get to the final world all the time but it's pretty much a matter of will I run out of stuff before I beat the final castle because I'm.

219
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:47,423
Speaker 0: there are a few levels in the in the final world that I'm not so good at and like the flying ships one sometimes I'll die a few times and I mean I have plenty of lives.

220
00:14:47,664 --> 00:14:52,471
Speaker 0: but if I don't have any goodies left in my goodie bin and I'm at the final castle what the fuck am I gonna do?

221
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:52,813
Speaker 0: I can't.

222
00:14:53,134 --> 00:14:54,984
Speaker 0: I can't beat it when I'm small I'm not that good.

223
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:58,443
Speaker 1: the final castle actually is pretty easy compared to everything else.

224
00:14:58,725 --> 00:14:59,831
Speaker 0: thing is I've done to see.

225
00:14:59,851 --> 00:15:04,779
Speaker 0: because of the way I play Mario 3 I've played the early levels a whole bunch in the late levels almost none.

226
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,350
Speaker 0: so I can beat the final castle and I know it.

227
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,877
Speaker 0: but I don't know it perfectly.

228
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:12,355
Speaker 0: so you know it's sort of like you know you do the final castle.

229
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:17,563
Speaker 0: I've played that level fewer times than any other level in the game except for maybe some world six and seven levels.

230
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:26,560
Speaker 1: but but anyway yeah the other confluence was that they took this 2d game and they added this kind of you know the weapon the way the game worked.

231
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:37,230
Speaker 1: they added the perfect measure for that kind of person the kind of person who would be drawn into that to make it this just epically legendary game that is loved to this day by gamers of all stripes.

232
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:46,542
Speaker 1: yep so uh anyway Castlevania judgment for the Wii is as far as I can tell a mediocre 3d fighting game.

233
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:47,768
Speaker 0: yeah I don't know why.

234
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:51,125
Speaker 0: who thought of this like hey we need a Castlevania for the Wii.

235
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:56,211
Speaker 0: I know let's make a fighting game with one fact in fact why don't I just make a side scroller with a whip?

236
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,204
Speaker 1: it looks a lot like Castlevania 64.

237
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:03,200
Speaker 0: yeah well Castlevania 64 trim didn't even really know existed.

238
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,817
Speaker 1: I just showed it to him because pretty much when the entire war was was announced was when I was already a PC gamer and just gave up on.

239
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:11,244
Speaker 0: see people always forget.

240
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:20,804
Speaker 0: you know they remember Superman 64 cuz has legendary terribleness but Castlevania 64 and Shadowgate 64 are also legendarily terrible.

241
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:22,373
Speaker 0: it's legendarily a word.

242
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:28,775
Speaker 1: yes it is now never forget but I have nothing more to say about it.

243
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:30,179
Speaker 1: it looks terrible yeah.

244
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,627
Speaker 1: but then Castlevania order of ecclesias ecclesia ecclesiastica doesn't matter.

245
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,959
Speaker 1: it's basically basically more of the same.

246
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,603
Speaker 0: it is just more side scrolling Castlevania the door just like all the other DS and GBA games.

247
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:57,817
Speaker 1: now my only worry is that if I were to rank the the modern side scrolling Castlevania's it would pretty much be DS Symphony Night portrait of ruin in that order and a lot of people are gonna hate me for that.

248
00:16:57,838 --> 00:16:59,004
Speaker 1: but I think DS was a better game.

249
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:04,837
Speaker 0: you didn't play all the GBA ones but I think the GBA ones from what I can tell I don't know for sure because I didn't play them.

250
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:11,050
Speaker 0: I think there's three of them and I think they were just like you know the DS one except of course no dual screen action.

251
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,906
Speaker 0: but they were the same kind of gameplay only less because it was GBA.

252
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:20,952
Speaker 1: but my problem is that DS was really good and portrait of ruin wasn't quite as good.

253
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:22,058
Speaker 1: I didn't really like it nearly.

254
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:29,199
Speaker 0: I didn't like it nearly as much either because he wasn't as big a game it didn't feel as epic and large and it didn't really have the same sort of stuff going on.

255
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:32,094
Speaker 0: and that dual character thing was just sort of annoying it wasn't.

256
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:37,317
Speaker 1: yeah of course it kind of made up for that by having the awesome bonus playthrough modes.

257
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:38,141
Speaker 0: yeah it did.

258
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:39,306
Speaker 0: and then Castlevania.

259
00:17:39,386 --> 00:17:43,144
Speaker 0: one of the the DS said Belmont mode right well it had Julius mode.

260
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:48,106
Speaker 1: right Julius mode but the this one had the armor mode and it had the vampire mode and all.

261
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:48,769
Speaker 1: it was awesome.

262
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,553
Speaker 0: yeah those are good.

263
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:54,844
Speaker 0: the thing is with that kind of game I don't feel like playing it again even with the different mode it's got.

264
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,251
Speaker 0: you know I don't know what it is.

265
00:17:56,653 --> 00:18:00,288
Speaker 1: see I kind of did but the problem is it wasn't as good as DS.

266
00:18:00,328 --> 00:18:08,424
Speaker 1: so if this third one isn't as good as porch if it isn't better than portrait of ruin I see the trend and I'm bowing out of these games forever.

267
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:16,226
Speaker 0: well I think what you could do is you would go and try to find that GBA cartridge that has the 2g to the first two GBA ones on it because that's a super bargain.

268
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:18,097
Speaker 0: and then if those are good get the third GBA.

269
00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:20,787
Speaker 1: I'll just play DS and Symphony of the night again.

270
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,416
Speaker 0: but hey yeah anyway.

271
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:33,108
Speaker 0: so speaking of people taking old genres and then to old games and try to mess them up capcom has finally done the opposite.

272
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:34,958
Speaker 0: I hope they start a trend for the future here.

273
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:36,383
Speaker 0: you probably all know this.

274
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:39,373
Speaker 0: but Megaman 9 yeah not Megaman X 9 not Megaman.

275
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:45,110
Speaker 0: you know battle network 9 not Megaman 9.

276
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,162
Speaker 0: 3d no Megaman not Megaman legends 2 or 3.

277
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,889
Speaker 0: Megaman 9 as it was.

278
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,874
Speaker 1: no Megaman legend.

279
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:52,255
Speaker 1: everyone.

280
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:54,946
Speaker 0: for anyone who doesn't know there were six Megaman games.

281
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:56,994
Speaker 0: for the NES.

282
00:18:57,355 --> 00:19:08,544
Speaker 0: there was one for the Super Nintendo which is Megaman 7 and there's one for the PlayStation which is Megaman 8 and the one for the SNES and the one for PlayStation actually got fancier than the originals.

283
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,818
Speaker 0: you know one through six were all the same kind of game.

284
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,023
Speaker 0: they all looked the same.

285
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:19,173
Speaker 1: well pretty much I would say this two through six are almost exactly the same ones lighting and once a little wonky.

286
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:20,117
Speaker 1: you know what what balls.

287
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,166
Speaker 1: I've never beaten it.

288
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:24,982
Speaker 0: I've beaten one but it was really hard especially the yellow blob guy.

289
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:32,127
Speaker 0: three added the slide and four or five added the charge regular gun but they were pretty much the same game.

290
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:36,180
Speaker 0: then Megaman 7 was a little different.

291
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,380
Speaker 0: you know.

292
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:40,583
Speaker 0: it was mostly the same gameplay but it was updated you know was not totally the same.

293
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,599
Speaker 0: it was a lot more like Megaman X in the way controlled and such.

294
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:48,082
Speaker 0: and then Megaman 8 was just a PlayStation monstrosity with this horrible anime at the front of it.

295
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:53,503
Speaker 0: good God but but Megaman 9 for Wii 360 and PlayStation and they're gonna be.

296
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:54,830
Speaker 0: it's gonna be a download game.

297
00:19:55,453 --> 00:20:00,310
Speaker 0: it's gonna be just like Megaman 1 through 6 only new and hard.

298
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:06,934
Speaker 1: this is fascinating because this is the kind of thing like I kind of hinted at earlier gamers.

299
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:10,916
Speaker 1: what pretty much when the N64 came out and all these games were different.

300
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:24,689
Speaker 1: I remember there was this giant outcry even back then for someone to just make one of the old 2d games make the Legend of Zelda or make a Final Fantasy or something with the memory and the power of the Nintendo 64.

301
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:44,313
Speaker 0: that's something I always said was like hey all right you know everyone's gone to making these 3d games and I think the reason they went to 3d and shied away from 2d is because systems like the Neo Geo the turbo graphics the Atari Jaguar especially when they made 2d games they made really big fancy 2d games.

302
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:45,418
Speaker 0: the people weren't into them.

303
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,488
Speaker 0: they went for the 3d games and 3d game sold.

304
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:52,394
Speaker 0: so people stayed with 3d and 2d games really only did well on the handhelds where they were necessary.

305
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:55,148
Speaker 0: but even now we're getting 3d games on the handhelds too.

306
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:08,061
Speaker 0: but I always said hey if you have such a powerful machine right with so much memory why don't you just make Super Metroid a game on the exactly the same as Super Metroid in terms of the way it plays?

307
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:09,286
Speaker 0: you know a side-scrolling.

308
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:14,044
Speaker 0: explore Planet Zeebs Metroid your Sam is turned into a ballgame.

309
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:20,590
Speaker 0: but just make the map like five times as big with like five times as many bosses and five times many secrets.

310
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,337
Speaker 1: and now great there are reasons.

311
00:21:23,401 --> 00:21:24,124
Speaker 1: I mean you've.

312
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:27,723
Speaker 1: one argument is that it does take a long time to develop that sort of thing.

313
00:21:27,763 --> 00:21:29,979
Speaker 0: well it doesn't take a lot of time to develop the technology.

314
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:33,735
Speaker 0: it takes a lot of time to make all those maps cuz whether it's 2d or 3d.

315
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:40,525
Speaker 0: you know it's a lay out the maps and that's a human job that takes a long time to get a test them in the hole.

316
00:21:40,705 --> 00:21:45,668
Speaker 1: but at the same time 2d games require far less playtesting than 3d games.

317
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,994
Speaker 0: that is definitely true.

318
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:48,602
Speaker 0: it also cost a lot less money.

319
00:21:49,064 --> 00:21:52,459
Speaker 0: now it looks like Mega Man 9 is gonna be the same size in terms of.

320
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,825
Speaker 1: you know how big the levels are compared to fine because being older and wiser I realize that I alright.

321
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:01,855
Speaker 1: so Final Fantasy 4 was 40 hours long.

322
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:06,712
Speaker 1: I don't need to play Final Fantasy 4 for 140 hours.

323
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:11,870
Speaker 0: not a Final Fantasy game that's for sure but Mega Man game with 18 robot masters.

324
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,174
Speaker 0: I would not be disappointed.

325
00:22:13,174 --> 00:22:15,521
Speaker 0: 16 robot master.

326
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:19,095
Speaker 1: in that case I think you have to add something more.

327
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:20,742
Speaker 1: maybe here's my vision.

328
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:27,386
Speaker 0: we have so many different weapons and levels would be larger and actually require you to use the different weapon.

329
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:35,408
Speaker 1: my vision would be a co-op 2d games Mega Man 0 except not shitty.

330
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:40,262
Speaker 1: I just imagine Mega Man 9 could also add a co-op mode.

331
00:22:40,644 --> 00:22:41,328
Speaker 0: that'd be alright.

332
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:53,077
Speaker 0: yeah there are a lot of things you could do with it but generally the idea is that there is a strong strong feeling at least within me and I hope within many other people that all we want is direct.

333
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:58,463
Speaker 0: I mean we want you know a lot of games now are sequels of old games but just make them like the old games.

334
00:22:58,644 --> 00:22:59,991
Speaker 0: only different means nothing.

335
00:23:00,473 --> 00:23:03,909
Speaker 0: people always you know game reviewers especially without his game doesn't innovate.

336
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:12,376
Speaker 0: what you don't always need to innovate I mean if you just took Super Metroid and made new levels even if it wasn't any bigger than Super Metroid it was just more Super Metroid.

337
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:13,945
Speaker 0: Super Metroid is great.

338
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:16,098
Speaker 0: let me look what's wrong with more Super Metroid.

339
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:21,424
Speaker 0: if I got a guy ice cream if I like strawberry ice cream I might get strawberry ice cream again next time.

340
00:23:21,464 --> 00:23:24,039
Speaker 0: it's not any different than last time but it's still good.

341
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:25,307
Speaker 0: I could still eat more of it.

342
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:27,802
Speaker 1: well there's also the idea of incremental improvements.

343
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:44,258
Speaker 1: I mean look at Warcraft Warcraft to Warcraft 3 or command and conquer command and conquer - they took a game it worked but technology got better and you know they learn more about game design and they said all right let's make that game but fix the things we know are wrong with

344
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:44,399
Speaker 0: it.

345
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:46,007
Speaker 0: yeah and that's the thing with Castlevania.

346
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:52,997
Speaker 0: look Castlevania you know the DS ones are not really that much of a departure from Castlevania one.

347
00:23:53,037 --> 00:24:02,475
Speaker 0: it's a side scrolling whipping game at heart and there's some extra stuff added on there mostly technological niceties and it's still great.

348
00:24:02,756 --> 00:24:08,299
Speaker 0: and you know trying to go away from that trying to make Castlevania 64 results in badness.

349
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:20,303
Speaker 1: see I think the problem is a lot of game designers and a lot of game buyers who aren't I guess I don't want to use the term like hard savvy people who really are fans of games more so than just playing them the people who care about them and think about it.

350
00:24:20,363 --> 00:24:23,739
Speaker 1: or gaming is not a distraction but it's actually a hobby.

351
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:33,804
Speaker 1: mm-hmm when you when there's a new game it seems like people who aren't like that or will look at it and say all right this new game has made previous games obsolete.

352
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:35,350
Speaker 1: I've made a new genre.

353
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:39,327
Speaker 1: I've made a 3d punching game so 2d punching games are obsolete.

354
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:45,594
Speaker 1: I want to make a 4d punching game 3d punch yeah which is you know 20 different guys to punch.

355
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,321
Speaker 0: that's the same as the NES punch out.

356
00:24:47,522 --> 00:24:48,929
Speaker 1: or well we've got 3d.

357
00:24:49,592 --> 00:24:51,078
Speaker 1: 2d side scrollers are obsolete.

358
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:55,294
Speaker 1: that's like saying well we've got the TV so radio is now obsolete.

359
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,826
Speaker 1: right granted a lot of people are saying that.

360
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,880
Speaker 1: that's why podcasting is still struggling so much.

361
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,004
Speaker 1: but it's much like how 2d games can coexist and have a place because they are a kind of game.

362
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:13,199
Speaker 1: among 3d games radio has a place among video because you can't always watch something while you're doing something there.

363
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:19,634
Speaker 0: even remember there are people out there who are modifying game ROMs those people they made to Zelda one game that wasn't set with all new maps.

364
00:25:19,654 --> 00:25:20,136
Speaker 0: now to see.

365
00:25:20,197 --> 00:25:22,928
Speaker 1: yeah it's stupid hard hard as ball.

366
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:27,592
Speaker 0: there's some guys who are making a Metroid 2 but they're making it on the Super Metroid engine.

367
00:25:27,954 --> 00:25:32,152
Speaker 0: there are those people who make those Mario world levels the super hard Mario 1 levels.

368
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:33,477
Speaker 0: there is a big.

369
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,194
Speaker 0: you know the reason that those those things are so popular.

370
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:39,465
Speaker 0: but can you know they're not stupidly popular?

371
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:41,255
Speaker 0: but this is because they're very inaccessible.

372
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:45,897
Speaker 0: if one of the big game companies actually made that sort of activity accessible.

373
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,484
Speaker 0: I think it would really explode.

374
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:53,107
Speaker 0: and Megaman 9 I think when you're gonna see how high its sales are will demonstrate that.

375
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,752
Speaker 1: but I gotta stress again this game is not going to be the Mario remake where it was easy as crap.

376
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:01,097
Speaker 0: no this is good.

377
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:04,169
Speaker 1: Megaman 9 is very hard.

378
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,076
Speaker 0: it's just as hard as all the other men.

379
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:08,525
Speaker 1: we didn't want to do Megaman but easy.

380
00:26:08,545 --> 00:26:11,757
Speaker 1: we want players to get better and we want them to remember.

381
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:17,725
Speaker 1: I've always tried to challenge players and I think there are gamers who miss being challenged by games.

382
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:19,471
Speaker 0: yes there are hello.

383
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:20,134
Speaker 0: I'm here.

384
00:26:20,716 --> 00:26:21,920
Speaker 1: I'm so looking forward to this.

385
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,831
Speaker 1: I wasn't even a huge fan of Megaman games.

386
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:24,877
Speaker 0: I thought you hated Megaman.

387
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:27,209
Speaker 1: I respect Megaman games for being good.

388
00:26:27,611 --> 00:26:29,119
Speaker 1: I enjoyed them and played them but they're.

389
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:35,133
Speaker 0: that kind of game is not my bag just like it's not really anything for Castlevania except for the shooting instead of whipping.

390
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:46,295
Speaker 1: yeah it's a little bit different in that much mainly the fact of course I point out that some people don't get it and because the thing I really didn't like was the basic gun that Megaman had and the way the game played before.

391
00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:50,636
Speaker 1: you had other things I didn't really like but quote some guy who doesn't know anything.

392
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,826
Speaker 1: of course Megaman 9 is hard.

393
00:26:52,846 --> 00:27:02,166
Speaker 1: I just wish they made it hard using something like enemy routes or bullet hells to get you in a tough situation instead of just gimping the controls to a shoot forward position.

394
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:08,101
Speaker 1: okay yeah I gotta say one more thing.

395
00:27:08,121 --> 00:27:10,010
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna bring this up real quick.

396
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:17,637
Speaker 1: the news everyone seems to be losing their shit about the fact that there's gonna be achievements in World of Warcraft and World of Warcraft is nothing but achievements.

397
00:27:17,698 --> 00:27:25,074
Speaker 1: what difference does it make if they put a label on them but people posted in our forum pointing out hey oh my god achievements in World of Warcraft?

398
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:26,762
Speaker 1: yeah we knew about this a month ago.

399
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:30,000
Speaker 0: next yeah I mean and seriously what difference does it make?

400
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:37,030
Speaker 0: you play World of Warcraft now you go on a quest you beat the quest they give you a you know a loot for your quest going.

401
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:50,596
Speaker 0: right now you're gonna go on the quest and it's gonna say congratulations you beat a quest and it'll give you a little badge the little sticker that you can wear on your on your on your merit badge sleeve thingy that you wear completed merit badges.

402
00:27:50,696 --> 00:27:56,133
Speaker 1: you now have the complete 50 quests quest or the mags distance fallen without dying quests.

403
00:27:57,979 --> 00:27:58,259
Speaker 1: I just.

404
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,127
Speaker 1: I feel more and more like this is.

405
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:05,212
Speaker 1: I mean I'm not saying Wow is dead or Blizzard is dead because it's just very far from the truth.

406
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:05,795
Speaker 0: I just think.

407
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:07,103
Speaker 0: I just say why is it news?

408
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,653
Speaker 0: the game has not changed in any way.

409
00:28:08,693 --> 00:28:10,603
Speaker 0: the only difference is that they're giving up merit badges.

410
00:28:10,884 --> 00:28:12,712
Speaker 1: well here's the thing the game.

411
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:20,543
Speaker 1: what is happening is that like ever I mean ever quest was the unassailable God back in the day and not that much.

412
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:22,332
Speaker 1: but they'll come out every other MMO.

413
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:24,061
Speaker 0: yeah yeah cuz it just cuz it.

414
00:28:24,643 --> 00:28:29,863
Speaker 0: that's like saying you know captain of the you know the second string football team.

415
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:32,314
Speaker 1: yeah but I mean there were different eras.

416
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:38,403
Speaker 1: there were different MMOs that were kind of the king and eventually valedictorian of the world of Warcraft.

417
00:28:38,423 --> 00:28:41,135
Speaker 1: school is going to fall eventually.

418
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:48,010
Speaker 1: World of Warcraft is not going to be the thing and some other game is going to make enough incremental improvements to destroy the World of Warcraft.

419
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,209
Speaker 0: World of Warcraft 2 no universe of Warcraft I've actually got.

420
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:59,642
Speaker 1: there's a couple of world of Starcraft on the horizon that we'll talk about later but Diablo 3 Diablo 3 is not the same genre of game.

421
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,893
Speaker 1: I believe it is in the click on things John.

422
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:02,897
Speaker 0: well that is true.

423
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:06,032
Speaker 0: however there's a. there's actually Diablo.

424
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:15,080
Speaker 1: I'd say it's actually a worse game than World of Warcraft if such a thing as possible but I feel as though they're adding this only in reaction to certain other games that might be doing this.

425
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:16,406
Speaker 0: indeed they're trying to.

426
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:24,086
Speaker 1: they're trying to prevent the small wound that they currently have from becoming infected and causing their gangrenous like to fall off anyway.

427
00:29:24,106 --> 00:29:26,778
Speaker 0: I don't think you don't worry about them dying anytime soon.

428
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,480
Speaker 1: I don't know.

429
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:29,023
Speaker 1: I give them three or four years.

430
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:37,178
Speaker 1: it's time for things.

431
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,881
Speaker 1: things of the day.

432
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:42,129
Speaker 0: doo doo doo okay doo doo.

433
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:50,135
Speaker 1: Vega posted this in our farm and this is so utterly adorable that I can't help but make it a thing of the day.

434
00:29:50,235 --> 00:30:05,698
Speaker 1: it's just a cute little animation of cloud and it's got a fantasy 7 cloud yes not lucky to and it's got this kind of really really cute beatbox going on and it's got this really really cute song and it's really really really cute.

435
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:10,669
Speaker 0: I mean there are some other videos that were like related on YouTube that were sort of the same thing but they weren't as good as this one.

436
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:11,353
Speaker 0: it's the only good one.

437
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:14,287
Speaker 1: this one is just so utterly cute.

438
00:30:14,428 --> 00:30:15,391
Speaker 1: I don't know what I can say.

439
00:30:15,411 --> 00:30:17,519
Speaker 0: yep my thing of the day.

440
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,794
Speaker 0: you've probably seen this all over the Internet's.

441
00:30:19,895 --> 00:30:22,348
Speaker 0: it's pretty much been everywhere but it's actually pretty cool.

442
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:32,477
Speaker 0: people have lately because JavaScript technology is getting so much better and Firefox and a guy went to school at RIT with who I'm actually sad when I found out he didn't graduate.

443
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:36,035
Speaker 0: it's like a big JavaScript evangelist at Mozilla and there's all sorts of stuff going on.

444
00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:44,158
Speaker 0: some guy found out it was actually possible to make a game that would play in JavaScript but it would all be displayed in the favicon.

445
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:45,864
Speaker 0: he just kept changing the favicon.

446
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:49,336
Speaker 0: so you can now play defender in the favicon.

447
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:56,227
Speaker 0: so you know when you visit a web page like you visit Google and this blue G just up next to the URL that lets you know you're at Google.

448
00:30:57,031 --> 00:31:00,388
Speaker 0: well now you can defender plays up there and that little square.

449
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:05,597
Speaker 1: if you go to this website here's on the website and you just you know wazzy around and hit n and you're playing defender.

450
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:09,073
Speaker 0: it's not good defender but I mean it's pretty much defender.

451
00:31:09,154 --> 00:31:11,043
Speaker 0: you can't teleport but you can go left.

452
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:15,367
Speaker 0: you can go right you can shoot the aliens the aliens come down grab the humans and try to fly away.

453
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:16,995
Speaker 0: you try to rescue the humans.

454
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:18,180
Speaker 0: that's defender.

455
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,248
Speaker 0: I don't know what else to call it.

456
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:22,940
Speaker 1: oh oh we almost forgot to talk about this.

457
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,551
Speaker 1: we have to bring this up before we get into the main bit.

458
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:28,665
Speaker 1: so Sonic unleash they're making a Sonic game.

459
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:33,507
Speaker 1: okay yeah despite the fact that you know now they got to take old games and just remake them.

460
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:43,735
Speaker 1: when we saw the gameplay footage from this game it is basically they have made Sonic the Hedgehog exactly what it always should have been but they were only limited by technology.

461
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:48,634
Speaker 1: it is just Sonic the Hedgehog running and it's awesome.

462
00:31:48,795 --> 00:31:49,919
Speaker 0: I mean I watched the.

463
00:31:50,059 --> 00:32:09,721
Speaker 0: if you watch the gameplay footage video on game trailers or whatever of this game you go okay there you have an example of how you can take a game keep what makes the game good at its core fully intact and even improve upon it while also updating the graphics and the technology and the sound and the controls and everything else.

464
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:15,771
Speaker 0: it's a. it looked like a Sonic game unlike you know some of the other games recently like Sonic Adventure and other shit like that.

465
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:22,100
Speaker 0: this is a Sonic game through and through even though the technology was you know crazy advanced.

466
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:23,345
Speaker 0: it like totally modern.

467
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:26,175
Speaker 1: it gives me this very parkour feel.

468
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,399
Speaker 0: yeah so it really.

469
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,310
Speaker 0: I saw that and I was like I'm buying that game.

470
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,396
Speaker 0: thank God it's for the Wii.

471
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:36,084
Speaker 1: so the news is not that the Sonic game is coming or that it looked completely utterly amazingly.

472
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:37,669
Speaker 1: oh my god awesome.

473
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:41,963
Speaker 1: the news is that in fact it is only 50 percent awesome.

474
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:50,474
Speaker 1: you see by day Sonic the Hedgehog is running parkour yamakaze whatever you want to call it through the city by night.

475
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:52,502
Speaker 1: it's final fight.

476
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:58,164
Speaker 0: it's lumbering stretchy werewolf final fight way to steal Kotaku's description there.

477
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:00,177
Speaker 1: but that's exactly what it is you might think.

478
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:00,841
Speaker 1: what do you mean?

479
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:01,745
Speaker 1: stretchy werewolf?

480
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:03,452
Speaker 1: look at this picture.

481
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:05,842
Speaker 0: the story apparently is in this game.

482
00:33:06,143 --> 00:33:07,490
Speaker 0: the game starts where dr.

483
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,153
Speaker 0: Robotnik.

484
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,263
Speaker 0: I guess whatever you want to call him I call him dr.

485
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:10,747
Speaker 0: Robotnik.

486
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:11,552
Speaker 0: you can call him egg.

487
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:13,804
Speaker 0: whatever you want to call him I don't.

488
00:33:13,985 --> 00:33:14,447
Speaker 0: yeah dr.

489
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:15,712
Speaker 0: Robotnik is the guy's name.

490
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,399
Speaker 0: there's only one guy Sonic.

491
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:19,045
Speaker 0: people shove it.

492
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,855
Speaker 0: he comes and he throws a cast emerald at Sonic.

493
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:24,644
Speaker 0: Sonic turns into like some sort of where Sonic.

494
00:33:24,664 --> 00:33:26,269
Speaker 0: so like a where Hedgehog.

495
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:33,793
Speaker 0: so already a hedgehog you can't like and throw up of some variety a double hedgehog.

496
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:34,315
Speaker 0: there you go.

497
00:33:34,576 --> 00:33:41,528
Speaker 0: so at night he turns in like this slow evil horrible beast that fights and punches and kicks and slashes but during the day.

498
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:44,665
Speaker 1: Sonic the Hedgehog doing his awesomeness except it doesn't look like he fights.

499
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:46,396
Speaker 1: it looks like he just stretches.

500
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,234
Speaker 0: this is definitely a case of try to do too much of it.

501
00:33:50,274 --> 00:33:50,776
Speaker 1: try to do.

502
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:56,358
Speaker 0: you should have just kept the awesome Sonic daytime action and just done like 20 levels of that.

503
00:33:56,378 --> 00:34:01,156
Speaker 0: you would have had a hit a super runaway hit a plus perfect game.

504
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:12,447
Speaker 0: first Sonic game I would have bought since like the 16-bit era but instead maybe I'll rent it discount bin something just to play the daytime part because we know the daytime parts are excellent.

505
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:14,377
Speaker 1: even just seeing it there's nothing.

506
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:18,239
Speaker 0: I should hire some kid to beat the nighttime parts for me and I'll play all the daytime part.

507
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,159
Speaker 1: there is nothing they could do as far as I can see to ruin the daytime part.

508
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,451
Speaker 1: based on what little I've seen it is epic.

509
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:30,754
Speaker 0: someone should release a hack daytime only Sonic Unleashed kind of like the Phantom Edit exactly alright.

510
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:32,940
Speaker 1: so I can't believe.

511
00:34:32,981 --> 00:34:34,491
Speaker 1: we haven't actually talked about this.

512
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:35,437
Speaker 0: I don't know have we?

513
00:34:35,476 --> 00:34:43,980
Speaker 0: we might have messed up alright and I'll double-check because we did a show on Battletech and we were gonna do a show on Battletech and we realized oops we did one already.

514
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:44,985
Speaker 0: then we saw it.

515
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:45,650
Speaker 0: hey let's do the show.

516
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,522
Speaker 0: natural selection oops we did one already.

517
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:48,867
Speaker 0: there was nothing to show on.

518
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:52,882
Speaker 0: there's a day news about Megaman 9 pretty big.

519
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:55,234
Speaker 0: why don't we do show on Megaman?

520
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:56,458
Speaker 1: guess what we've ever done?

521
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,827
Speaker 0: a show on Megaman that's good.

522
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:02,219
Speaker 0: so Megaman 2 is the best video game of all time.

523
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,644
Speaker 0: I don't care what you say.

524
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:11,656
Speaker 1: playing this port of Megaman on the computer in the back of my fifth grade elementary school port of miss.

525
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,284
Speaker 0: what was that like a port of Megaman?

526
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:13,586
Speaker 1: I don't know.

527
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:13,867
Speaker 1: it was just.

528
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:15,276
Speaker 1: it was Megaman on the PC.

529
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:18,288
Speaker 0: really I paid Megaman X the official DOS version.

530
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,692
Speaker 0: it was a Capcom.

531
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:27,754
Speaker 0: Capcom sold it in comp USA on a CD-ROM and it came with the six button controller that you could also use for Street Fighter on your computer which I also.

532
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,705
Speaker 0: I have Street Fighter 2 turbo for the computer.

533
00:35:29,725 --> 00:35:30,308
Speaker 0: I still have it.

534
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,811
Speaker 0: championship edition no it's Street Fighter 2 it's super Street Fighter 2 turbo.

535
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:35,715
Speaker 0: that's what it is.

536
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:37,525
Speaker 0: it comes after championship edition.

537
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:40,321
Speaker 0: it has the four extra people you know in Akuma and the whole thing.

538
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:51,644
Speaker 0: but anyway Megaman Megaman when I was a kid right you know I wanted NES for a long time as every kid did and I got one like a year or so later than some of the other kids.

539
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:58,702
Speaker 0: he may be two years later you know cuz waiting for the birthday to come around and the whole bit you know and parents being cheap and stuff like that.

540
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:00,530
Speaker 0: but it's okay I got it in time.

541
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:03,564
Speaker 1: I was all cool but see I didn't get Megaman one.

542
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:06,837
Speaker 0: I got Megaman - I'm finishing my story.

543
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:13,744
Speaker 0: okay I also got Megaman - okay because my birthday you know they gave me you know the NES and the Mario.

544
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:15,957
Speaker 0: I think a birthday was like on a Monday or something.

545
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:17,444
Speaker 0: I forget what the situation was like.

546
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:33,015
Speaker 0: people were over maybe the day before so they gave me the NES and the Mario dot-com on that day but the next morning it was like okay you can have the Megaman - now Megaman - not only did I play the hell out of that game I mean and it wasn't like now where it's like.

547
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:33,859
Speaker 0: I know the password.

548
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,381
Speaker 0: just go to the end or I could just look up and see what order to fight the guys in right.

549
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:39,466
Speaker 1: it's kind of obvious.

550
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:44,471
Speaker 0: metal man beats wood man I know but well fireman actually man actually beats wood man even better.

551
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:47,306
Speaker 1: yeah metal man beats everything.

552
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:54,848
Speaker 0: I remember a day when like I could I couldn't beat airman even though airman was supposed to be easiest level because I couldn't deal with the jumping parts or the platforming.

553
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:58,287
Speaker 0: I wasn't that good yet because I mean this is the first time I ever had an NES.

554
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:09,293
Speaker 0: it took me a long time to beat that game but I remember one morning before Saturday morning cartoons I got to the end and that alien came up and it was just like oh shit oh shit.

555
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:11,000
Speaker 0: hey well man it was good.

556
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,832
Speaker 0: and then I finally I tried every item until eventually I figured out to use the bubble and I beat that alien and it was crazy.

557
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:18,654
Speaker 0: it was like.

558
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,481
Speaker 0: it was like a if he.

559
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:23,714
Speaker 0: if you know people have spiritual video game experiences.

560
00:37:24,256 --> 00:37:24,698
Speaker 0: that was it.

561
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,613
Speaker 1: yes now is - Scott what bionic commandos.

562
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:30,942
Speaker 0: but now beating Megaman - is sort of like a reflex.

563
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,895
Speaker 0: now I can just do it but in those days it was.

564
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:40,929
Speaker 0: I mean when that dragon shows up and you're a little kid you just say you see that gigantic dragon just come out of the darkness behind you.

565
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:42,636
Speaker 0: holy shit.

566
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:44,988
Speaker 0: that's like because the whole game has just been sort of.

567
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:53,591
Speaker 0: you know little bad guys you know how to deal with robot masters you know how to use your items you know but when you see that dragon appeared it's that huge.

568
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:55,701
Speaker 0: we see that big tank appear in the next level.

569
00:37:56,022 --> 00:38:09,814
Speaker 0: ah and like that gigantic gigantic tall chasm that you fall down into the abyss with spite with instant kill spikes lining all of the walls or in quick man's lover yet to fall through the incredible fast-moving lasers.

570
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:14,957
Speaker 1: you know that that level more than anything in most video games ever played.

571
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:16,785
Speaker 1: there's a certain feeling.

572
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:19,756
Speaker 1: you get this very very specific feeling.

573
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:23,075
Speaker 1: old-school gamers are much more familiar with this than a lot of new school games.

574
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:27,978
Speaker 1: don't quite give you this this visceral fear of if you screw up at all you're going to die.

575
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:36,562
Speaker 1: this level of tension that gets to the point that when you finally make it or when you finally die you're gripping the controller so hard that you might have broken it.

576
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:38,912
Speaker 0: that's the one thing I think that makes.

577
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:54,142
Speaker 0: that sets Mega Man apart from some of the other platformers like say the Castlevania's and the Mario's is that you have these situations where you know you are pretty much incredibly close to instant death and they give you this margin of safety that you can get through.

578
00:38:54,162 --> 00:38:59,552
Speaker 0: I mean you don't have to be a hundred percent precise to beat quick man's area but you have to be ninety percent.

579
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:01,742
Speaker 0: yeah you gotta be nine you know you're.

580
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:09,660
Speaker 0: you go there you die a few times but then when you it is possible to get through it's not so hard that you're just frustrated want to kill yourself.

581
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:13,356
Speaker 0: but then again it's not so easy that you can just do it with nothing.

582
00:39:13,697 --> 00:39:19,282
Speaker 0: so when you actually succeed and you will if you persist it feels really really really good.

583
00:39:19,302 --> 00:39:22,219
Speaker 0: of course if you already know how to do it you can do it every time.

584
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:25,014
Speaker 0: it feels a little bit less good but it's good nonetheless.

585
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:28,651
Speaker 1: my strategy I'd always actually beat him first without any items.

586
00:39:28,712 --> 00:39:29,536
Speaker 0: that's a good way to go.

587
00:39:29,556 --> 00:39:33,077
Speaker 0: the other thing is that the game you know gives you a lot of options.

588
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:40,046
Speaker 0: I mean it's like you can use flash man to pause quick man's instant kill lasers in his level to get through more easily.

589
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:46,975
Speaker 0: but and that's a valid move except if you have the flash man weapon you know the flash pause whatever it's called.

590
00:39:47,698 --> 00:39:54,365
Speaker 0: if you use that on quick man himself you can drain half of his life bar without taking any damage yourself.

591
00:39:54,727 --> 00:40:00,534
Speaker 0: so if you can get through the lasers without getting hit you're much better off by saving that move for cook man himself.

592
00:40:01,578 --> 00:40:03,164
Speaker 1: so what is it about these Megaman games?

593
00:40:03,244 --> 00:40:16,002
Speaker 0: I think we need to explain what a Megaman game is the original Megaman series which is a much simpler side-scrolling series pretty much every year in the US.

594
00:40:16,102 --> 00:40:16,764
Speaker 1: it was 87 89 90 92 92 94 95.

595
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:30,245
Speaker 0: the Megaman X was a more technologically advanced game and it's not Megaman 10. anyone who says that is stupid.

596
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:31,314
Speaker 0: you know what the hell you're talking about.

597
00:40:31,354 --> 00:40:32,904
Speaker 1: now there will be a Megaman 10.

598
00:40:32,904 --> 00:40:36,040
Speaker 0: Megaman X is basically like okay we have the Super Nintendo now.

599
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,926
Speaker 0: alright let's make a Megaman game that is you know set in the future is actually different character.

600
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:43,394
Speaker 0: he's the Megaman of the future.

601
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:44,278
Speaker 0: right dr.

602
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,062
Speaker 0: light is dead.

603
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:48,938
Speaker 0: you know it's past the end of the world now but it's the same universe.

604
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,807
Speaker 0: and this is the robot that dr.

605
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:53,178
Speaker 0: light made and was in hibernation and then woke up.

606
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:54,585
Speaker 0: and it's.

607
00:40:54,645 --> 00:40:57,357
Speaker 0: he's sort of like Megaman and it's the same kind of game.

608
00:40:57,377 --> 00:41:05,929
Speaker 0: you know pick the levels you know go in you know fight the robot masters get to the boss but the bad guy is not dr.

609
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:06,331
Speaker 0: wily.

610
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:09,363
Speaker 0: it's like Sigma or whatever and there's a lot more to it.

611
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:17,605
Speaker 0: you can re-enter levels that you've already beaten to go and get items you may have left behind and in addition to the weapons you get from beating the robot masters.

612
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:23,007
Speaker 0: there are like five power-ups like you need Megaman X's better helmet his better body.

613
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:26,786
Speaker 0: armor is better gloves is better shoes you know is better pants.

614
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:30,082
Speaker 0: the whole thing and they give you even more different abilities.

615
00:41:30,143 --> 00:41:34,180
Speaker 0: and this it basically does with Super Metroid is to regular Metroid.

616
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,811
Speaker 0: you know it just adds a lot more stuff to it.

617
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:40,307
Speaker 0: it's not too much but it's not so little that it does nothing either.

618
00:41:40,427 --> 00:41:46,035
Speaker 1: see I'll admit though I mean I enjoy playing a Megaman game I can't stand the Megaman X game.

619
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:48,225
Speaker 0: well I think what it is the Megaman style of game.

620
00:41:48,285 --> 00:41:54,349
Speaker 0: yeah Megaman X one is is good stuff but as it goes on he gets like Megaman X three four five.

621
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:58,086
Speaker 0: it gets to be sort of annoying a little cluttered a little messy.

622
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:58,589
Speaker 0: it's not.

623
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:04,455
Speaker 0: it's not the smooth experience of one of the original Megaman games and it doesn't have the charm that you know.

624
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:07,450
Speaker 0: Megaman X and Megaman one two three.

625
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,178
Speaker 0: had you know that there's something missing there?

626
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,174
Speaker 0: I think that's another great thing about all the Megaman games.

627
00:42:13,234 --> 00:42:23,278
Speaker 0: they sort of keep that you know especially when you're a kid and when games has still had a sneak to them of surprise and not knowing what lies beyond.

628
00:42:23,298 --> 00:42:25,470
Speaker 0: I mean I talked about the dragon appearing from the darkness.

629
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,703
Speaker 0: well how about Megaman - you get to the end.

630
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:31,280
Speaker 0: they make you fight all the robot masters again ghosts of them.

631
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:35,140
Speaker 0: you mean that's doesn't seem like a big deal but it was like whoa totally crazy.

632
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,583
Speaker 0: and then that's like a skull in the final level and then another skull appears.

633
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:42,291
Speaker 0: it's the real final level.

634
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:44,079
Speaker 0: it's like oh my god think about that.

635
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:46,691
Speaker 1: that's kind of a cliche in a lot of games today.

636
00:42:46,712 --> 00:42:52,542
Speaker 1: you know the square boss of the sort of first you beat the boss and then there's another but back then that shit didn't happen.

637
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:53,547
Speaker 0: no it didn't happen.

638
00:42:53,728 --> 00:42:54,391
Speaker 1: I mean half it.

639
00:42:54,411 --> 00:43:03,877
Speaker 1: I'm as a kid when that happened when I saw that I remember like I dropped the controller I started yelling for my brother and he comes and I'm like he's like what what I'm like?

640
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:04,921
Speaker 1: look he's like what I'm like.

641
00:43:05,202 --> 00:43:28,540
Speaker 0: there's there's another level there's another skull or Megaman 3. right you beat all the robot masters and then these four new levels appear and each level has two of these clone robot thingies that actually take the place of robot masters from Megaman 2. so it's like you're playing Megaman 3 and all of a sudden Bubble Man shows up and you're like oh fuck oh fuck it's Bubble Man.

642
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:31,273
Speaker 1: oh my god I know how dangerous that bubble is.

643
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:33,281
Speaker 0: well you know Bubble Man is not too hard.

644
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:42,035
Speaker 0: but seeing Bubble Man in Megaman 3 is like oh shit and it had a lot of those oh shits that other games really didn't have.

645
00:43:42,096 --> 00:43:52,718
Speaker 0: I mean you didn't play Castlevania 4 and say oh shit there's something for Castlevania 1. you didn't even play like you know SNES Zelda and say oh shit it's Digdogger.

646
00:43:52,738 --> 00:43:55,451
Speaker 0: oh shit because Digdogger wasn't in there it didn't.

647
00:43:55,572 --> 00:43:56,175
Speaker 0: it didn't have.

648
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:57,039
Speaker 0: that you know.

649
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,729
Speaker 0: bring it back action that Megaman had.

650
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:07,159
Speaker 1: My fondest memories are actually from Megaman 3 partly because I rented it and I wanted to buy it.

651
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:08,284
Speaker 1: my parents wouldn't buy it for me.

652
00:44:08,304 --> 00:44:11,481
Speaker 0: I had Megaman 3. only ones I owned were actually 2 and 3.

653
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,350
Speaker 0: I played 4, 5 and 6 emulated.

654
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:18,013
Speaker 0: I played one emulated but now I have actually all of them on that Game Boy disc GameCube disc.

655
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:22,115
Speaker 0: I actually have the other GameCube disc that has all the Megaman X's so I have every Megaman.

656
00:44:22,256 --> 00:44:29,709
Speaker 1: So this kid in my neighborhood decided that he didn't want Megaman 3 anymore so he wondered if I wanted to trade him a game for him.

657
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,453
Speaker 0: What were you gonna trade him?

658
00:44:30,675 --> 00:44:30,936
Speaker 0: Well.

659
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:31,700
Speaker 0: Find a stick?

660
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,023
Speaker 1: I traded him.

661
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:35,974
Speaker 1: I'm one thing led to another and I traded him.

662
00:44:36,034 --> 00:44:36,697
Speaker 1: hide lied.

663
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,424
Speaker 0: Oh hide lied.

664
00:44:38,464 --> 00:44:40,314
Speaker 0: the game that's great on paper bad in reality.

665
00:44:40,354 --> 00:44:40,756
Speaker 0: I'll tell you.

666
00:44:40,776 --> 00:44:48,985
Speaker 1: the long story short is that his mom came over and we ended up being forced to give Megaman 3 back.

667
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:51,274
Speaker 1: Which was fine.

668
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:54,284
Speaker 1: cuz it turned out he'd actually stolen Megaman 3 from some other kid.

669
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,251
Speaker 0: Yeah.

670
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:57,997
Speaker 0: Megaman 3 actually had this bug in it.

671
00:44:58,078 --> 00:44:59,604
Speaker 1: Oh it had an awesome bug.

672
00:44:59,624 --> 00:45:02,618
Speaker 0: The second player could hold button downs in their controller.

673
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:03,523
Speaker 0: I think you hold left.

674
00:45:03,725 --> 00:45:04,710
Speaker 0: You had to hold something.

675
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:05,555
Speaker 0: select I don't remember.

676
00:45:05,595 --> 00:45:06,179
Speaker 1: No it was left.

677
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:08,410
Speaker 1: and then what would happen is if you fell into a pit.

678
00:45:09,254 --> 00:45:11,502
Speaker 1: you would you know you died but not immediately.

679
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:12,265
Speaker 0: Well you died.

680
00:45:12,285 --> 00:45:14,093
Speaker 0: it went doo doo doo but you weren't dead.

681
00:45:14,113 --> 00:45:21,109
Speaker 1: No no in the game code you didn't die immediately like it did the doo doo doo but the game code for and the level start over didn't kick in right away.

682
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:24,990
Speaker 0: Right you had zero health and you were dead but you were still alive.

683
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:25,975
Speaker 0: you could walk around.

684
00:45:25,995 --> 00:45:28,569
Speaker 0: you could also jump stupidly high for some reason.

685
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:30,641
Speaker 1: Well no no there was a lot more complicated than that.

686
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:35,687
Speaker 1: so one if you jump in like you're holding it and you jump into the pit you don't even go doo doo doo.

687
00:45:35,707 --> 00:45:39,067
Speaker 1: you just can stand in there and kind of jump back out but then if you let go you die.

688
00:45:39,087 --> 00:45:45,655
Speaker 1: and if you get the timing right where you die and you have no life but then you jump out the music stops.

689
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:46,217
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,865
Speaker 1: Everything gets all weird and then as long as left's being held down you can jump super high but you can't shoot.

691
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:53,731
Speaker 1: so usually you wanted to go.

692
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,554
Speaker 0: I thought you could shoot.

693
00:45:54,574 --> 00:45:54,935
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

694
00:45:54,955 --> 00:45:56,019
Speaker 1: No no you couldn't.

695
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:00,022
Speaker 1: so usually if you wanted to play around with this you had to go beat needle man first.

696
00:46:00,062 --> 00:46:03,802
Speaker 1: that way you could use his needle gun and basically like your normal weapon.

697
00:46:03,822 --> 00:46:06,659
Speaker 1: so you could still go around and break through things and do all your stuff.

698
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:14,424
Speaker 0: I used that a few times you know playing around mostly with friends but I haven't done it in so long.

699
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:19,066
Speaker 1: See I played the game legitimately a lot of the time but I use that bug a lot just to explore.

700
00:46:19,146 --> 00:46:21,054
Speaker 1: you could do some weird shit.

701
00:46:21,235 --> 00:46:26,160
Speaker 0: You could especially in some of those levels that had the Mega Man 2 bosses in them because they were like.

702
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:30,114
Speaker 0: there's a huge part where it was just big empty tracks of space.

703
00:46:30,657 --> 00:46:35,201
Speaker 0: Mega Man 3 actually added Rush the dog which people thought was a big deal and they were all crazy about it.

704
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:36,949
Speaker 0: but I was like what's the difference?

705
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:42,953
Speaker 0: Mega Man 2 had the 1, 2, 3 items and Rush is no different than the 1, 2, 3 items.

706
00:46:42,993 --> 00:46:44,197
Speaker 0: it just looks like a dog.

707
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,763
Speaker 0: it doesn't make it any different.

708
00:46:47,048 --> 00:46:48,533
Speaker 0: Proto Man's also the fucking bomb.

709
00:46:49,617 --> 00:46:50,400
Speaker 0: That's something else.

710
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,267
Speaker 0: Mega Man 3 the added Proto Man.

711
00:46:52,308 --> 00:47:03,366
Speaker 0: I mean you're going through a game normal as everything and then suddenly this is weird whistling music and this guy shows up and you shoot him and he goes away and he doesn't die and he just comes back every once in a while.

712
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:05,675
Speaker 0: and it's super mysterious.

713
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:07,140
Speaker 0: I love mysterious people.

714
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,140
Speaker 0: don't put mysterious unexplained shit in games like that anymore.

715
00:47:10,481 --> 00:47:17,831
Speaker 0: it's always sort of obvious and transparent and it doesn't really evoke that feeling of curiosity or mysteriousness.

716
00:47:17,952 --> 00:47:18,816
Speaker 1: Or it's Kojima.

717
00:47:19,197 --> 00:47:19,820
Speaker 0: Or it's Kojima.

718
00:47:22,362 --> 00:47:24,752
Speaker 0: One time I was playing Mega Man 2 and there was a babysitter over.

719
00:47:24,772 --> 00:47:29,936
Speaker 0: I was that young right and I was fighting Bubble Man and I jump up and I actually the.

720
00:47:30,057 --> 00:47:32,266
Speaker 0: you know there's the doors that go to the boss rooms.

721
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:35,478
Speaker 0: the door opened and I left the boss room.

722
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:37,046
Speaker 0: it went tick tick tick tick tick.

723
00:47:37,428 --> 00:47:40,203
Speaker 1: it's always scary when that happens and I was like weird like that.

724
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:42,654
Speaker 0: so I'm like oh shit oh shit oh shit.

725
00:47:43,257 --> 00:47:44,845
Speaker 0: I thought I found some amazing secret right.

726
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:47,959
Speaker 0: so then I go back through back into the boss room.

727
00:47:47,979 --> 00:47:49,185
Speaker 0: it goes tick tick tick tick tick.

728
00:47:49,848 --> 00:47:53,987
Speaker 0: I'm in this boss room and it looks mostly like Bubble Man's boss room but it's not.

729
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:59,418
Speaker 0: there's like a ladder and there's some platforms but they're invisible but I can walk on them and I can sort of.

730
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:09,712
Speaker 0: I figured out the layout of the room by jumping around climbing the ladders trying to walk every which way and it's sort of like this symmetrical room with four platforms on each side and two ladders.

731
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:17,831
Speaker 0: and I just played around in his room for like an hour thinking I had found some like amazing hidden secret and I was like oh my god oh my god.

732
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:18,915
Speaker 1: we've said this.

733
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:20,482
Speaker 0: it was just a glitch in the system.

734
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:33,610
Speaker 1: yeah but back in the day just because of the nature of old games gamers like I mean nowadays if you're playing Metal Gear 4 and it glitches you just reboot you reset it because the game's broken and you want to keep playing but glitches.

735
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:38,712
Speaker 1: back then before they were demystified to the world and two gamers were kind of this mystery world.

736
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:40,118
Speaker 0: well look at Metroid 1.

737
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:40,761
Speaker 0: I mean come on.

738
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:45,725
Speaker 1: okay I spent more time exploring Metroid 1 for weird stuff than I ever did trying to beat it.

739
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:47,314
Speaker 1: that's probably why I never actually beat it.

740
00:48:47,575 --> 00:48:50,571
Speaker 0: yeah I've beaten it but you know it's much more.

741
00:48:50,692 --> 00:48:52,541
Speaker 0: Metroid 1 at least is more fun to go looking for.

742
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:54,047
Speaker 0: the hack super Metroid is for beating.

743
00:48:54,449 --> 00:48:57,259
Speaker 0: yeah so is Metroid 2?

744
00:48:57,259 --> 00:48:59,852
Speaker 1: Mega Man 2 is probably the best one so far though.

745
00:48:59,892 --> 00:49:05,662
Speaker 0: yeah I think the other thing I would say about Mega Man 2 is that he just has this you know charm to the styling of it.

746
00:49:05,722 --> 00:49:07,828
Speaker 0: I mean you know 20x dx.

747
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:11,739
Speaker 0: really good music wood man flash man.

748
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:14,778
Speaker 0: I mean this is how it's how you're not talking about Bob and George.

749
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:16,487
Speaker 0: well this is a terrible comic.

750
00:49:16,588 --> 00:49:21,654
Speaker 0: can actually make you know some funny ones because Mega Man is such a great source material but they weren't that funny.

751
00:49:22,056 --> 00:49:24,425
Speaker 0: flash man is funny a flash man joke.

752
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:27,676
Speaker 0: it's a flash man.

753
00:49:27,696 --> 00:49:28,338
Speaker 0: we're in trench coat.

754
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,591
Speaker 0: I mean come on that's that's not it is obvious but it's still funny.

755
00:49:32,193 --> 00:49:41,561
Speaker 1: see it would be funny if it was wood man and it's like who you're dressed up as he was like at a costume party let's say and wood man is dressed up as flash man because there's wood under.

756
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:44,311
Speaker 1: there are not reading Bob and George.

757
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:49,928
Speaker 0: terrible quick man and not satisfying ladies.

758
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:52,677
Speaker 1: oh yeah cuz that was a clever joke.

759
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:54,343
Speaker 1: where's the air man joke?

760
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:56,330
Speaker 1: where's the guts man?

761
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:57,574
Speaker 0: joke guts man.

762
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:01,472
Speaker 0: he's got guts it's not a joke it's man that's not man.

763
00:50:01,713 --> 00:50:03,883
Speaker 1: you know what I got to say this talk about mystification.

764
00:50:04,264 --> 00:50:08,925
Speaker 1: when I finally got a hold of Mega Man one like I. this was before game facts.

765
00:50:09,026 --> 00:50:11,823
Speaker 1: I didn't even have an instruction book and no one none of my friends owned it.

766
00:50:12,325 --> 00:50:17,371
Speaker 1: so I remember I'm playing it and I kept seeing guts man and I knew from other Mega Man's.

767
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:22,769
Speaker 1: you know well all the one other Mega Man from Mega Man - all right when you beat a robot master you get his power.

768
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:27,436
Speaker 1: I couldn't for the life of me imagine what guts man's power was.

769
00:50:27,577 --> 00:50:29,908
Speaker 0: these throw rocks I guess something like that something like that.

770
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:33,526
Speaker 1: I was desperate I constantly tried but I sucked.

771
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:34,330
Speaker 1: so bad that game.

772
00:50:34,411 --> 00:50:35,616
Speaker 1: I never even saw guts man.

773
00:50:35,898 --> 00:50:37,585
Speaker 0: that's something about Mega Man one.

774
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:44,409
Speaker 0: actually it only has six robot masters whereas Mega Man - as eight and that's pretty much the limit they're so hard they're all.

775
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:49,461
Speaker 0: they're stupid hard and the levels that come after even harder like where you have to fight that yellow guy with the giant eyeball.

776
00:50:50,024 --> 00:50:50,828
Speaker 0: oh is he hard?

777
00:50:50,888 --> 00:50:52,959
Speaker 0: it's like the heart one of the hardest bosses ever.

778
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:58,064
Speaker 0: I mean you got to be cutting even if you have full weapons and full ammo and full health.

779
00:50:58,365 --> 00:51:03,489
Speaker 0: that yellow guy who breaks into pieces is stupid hard even though it's basically just a memorization game.

780
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:05,878
Speaker 1: memorizing it's the first step.

781
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,226
Speaker 1: the second step is doing well.

782
00:51:07,246 --> 00:51:10,785
Speaker 0: a lot of Mega Man games in general are memorization but you know what.

783
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:16,210
Speaker 0: it's not the kind of memorization in Ikaruga where you have to memorize the exact pattern to move.

784
00:51:16,692 --> 00:51:17,939
Speaker 0: it's you memorize.

785
00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:23,828
Speaker 0: you know it's pretty easy to memorize so they don't give you too much and you don't have to memorize like this per really precise thing.

786
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:35,139
Speaker 0: you just sort of had to remember in general like okay this screen has instant death lasers so I have to go to the bottom as quickly as possible and I can't go for that tempting e-tank over there.

787
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:40,630
Speaker 1: there's also a lot of you know all right there's a ton of different ways to get past any given normal enemy and there's like.

788
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:43,868
Speaker 1: there's the normal enemies and then the slightly bigger enemies.

789
00:51:43,888 --> 00:51:50,926
Speaker 1: they all have different patterns and part of the game is how do I get by this guy without taking a bunch of damage like looking Heat Man's level right.

790
00:51:50,966 --> 00:51:52,213
Speaker 0: there's a part in Heat Man's level.

791
00:51:52,273 --> 00:51:54,182
Speaker 0: there's a gigantic pit and you can.

792
00:51:54,443 --> 00:52:00,032
Speaker 0: there are blocks that appear and disappear and you can jump and be really good with your jumping to get across.

793
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:07,567
Speaker 0: or you can use the number two item and drain your number two energy to use this sort of jet to get across and it's totally up to you.

794
00:52:07,648 --> 00:52:09,659
Speaker 0: but there are advantages and disadvantages to both.

795
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:18,529
Speaker 1: plus instead of being an instant death game with a life meter one of the things that was great was that you didn't have to do every part of a level or every part of a boss fight perfectly.

796
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:18,911
Speaker 1: there's this.

797
00:52:19,293 --> 00:52:29,704
Speaker 1: the margin of error was big enough to keep the game really interesting and then it gave that extra danger of every now and then there was a sudden death thing and those things were real scary as a result.

798
00:52:29,865 --> 00:52:43,794
Speaker 0: but yeah the music in Mega Man is probably some of the best music even in the even in some of the bad Mega Man games like the ending music to Mega Man 5. that's one of the best ending songs there is.

799
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:45,400
Speaker 0: yeah I mean Mega Man 5.

800
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,822
Speaker 0: I like it because of his proto madness but it's not really the best Mega Man game really at all.

801
00:52:51,384 --> 00:52:54,078
Speaker 1: but two and three I think are definitely my favorite.

802
00:52:54,098 --> 00:52:55,427
Speaker 0: two and three are definitely where it's at.

803
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:57,297
Speaker 0: that is the popular maybe not?

804
00:52:57,437 --> 00:52:58,382
Speaker 0: well you know there's.

805
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:00,612
Speaker 0: that is the popular conception and it is not wrong.

806
00:53:00,672 --> 00:53:03,422
Speaker 1: the problem is why can't 9 be on the DS?

807
00:53:03,924 --> 00:53:07,418
Speaker 1: that's a good question cuz I play my ideas more than anything else.

808
00:53:07,499 --> 00:53:08,926
Speaker 1: it's the perfect game for the DS.

809
00:53:09,388 --> 00:53:13,839
Speaker 0: yeah I guess they just want to have it on the TV to make it you know just like the olden days which is fine.

810
00:53:13,879 --> 00:53:15,330
Speaker 1: cuz I'm probably gonna play the hell out of it.

811
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:16,899
Speaker 0: I'm gonna play the hell out of it for sure.

812
00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:20,379
Speaker 1: actually I have this terrible urge to play Mega Man 2 right now.

813
00:53:20,439 --> 00:53:21,103
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be playing it.

814
00:53:21,425 --> 00:53:24,540
Speaker 0: let me just quickly go through some of the non regular Mega Man games.

815
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,845
Speaker 1: about Mega Man and base.

816
00:53:26,448 --> 00:53:30,765
Speaker 0: that's sort of like Mega Man 10 ish kind of came after eight.

817
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:35,183
Speaker 0: it's not I know but it's not Mega Man X series.

818
00:53:35,223 --> 00:53:38,737
Speaker 0: it's definitely the regular Mega Man series but it's a little bit different.

819
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:43,034
Speaker 0: you know it's not Mega Man 9 it's this is Mega Man 9 and about

820
00:53:43,074 --> 00:53:46,226
Speaker 1: Mega Man the Wily Wars on the Sega Mega Drive the

821
00:53:46,286 --> 00:53:51,893
Speaker 0: Sega Genesis Mega Man game is actually just Mega Man 1 2 & 3 on a single cartridge with updated graphics

822
00:53:52,314 --> 00:53:55,646
Speaker 1: yep as well as the Wily Tower minigame.

823
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,011
Speaker 0: that's a bad game it's not?

824
00:53:57,031 --> 00:54:00,963
Speaker 1: I can't be as bad as tingles tower fucking Broncos within the met.

825
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,121
Speaker 0: they were Mega Man games to the Game Boy.

826
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:07,616
Speaker 0: or you can actually get Mega Man 2 for the original Game Boy.

827
00:54:07,918 --> 00:54:12,080
Speaker 0: but the way it worked is it was you played for robot masters then for others.

828
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:24,290
Speaker 0: instead if you can is that of being able to choose from all eight right away and the levels are very simplified and not quite as good as real Mega Man 2. but the Mega Man Game Boy games are good in their own right.

829
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:29,418
Speaker 1: but if you really want to play portable Mega Man wow they had a two three four and five on the Game Boy.

830
00:54:29,438 --> 00:54:35,825
Speaker 0: I know you should get Mega Man zero and that series for the GBA which is very supposed to be very old-school.

831
00:54:35,885 --> 00:54:42,719
Speaker 0: it's very super Nintendo II very really hard kind of Mega Man but me it's a little closer to a Mega Man X than a regular Mega Man.

832
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:44,509
Speaker 0: but I've heard good things about them.

833
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,333
Speaker 0: you then ever played them.

834
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,743
Speaker 0: Mega Man Legends is abomination.

835
00:54:47,783 --> 00:54:51,237
Speaker 0: terrible 3d RPG for the PlayStation the n64 and such.

836
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,105
Speaker 0: avoid it at all costs.

837
00:54:53,145 --> 00:54:54,009
Speaker 0: some people like it.

838
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:54,874
Speaker 0: they're all fool.

839
00:54:54,934 --> 00:54:55,800
Speaker 1: wait is that the game?

840
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,275
Speaker 1: where it starts there's a fire and you have to put the fire out.

841
00:54:58,436 --> 00:54:59,784
Speaker 0: and the thing that might be that game?

842
00:54:59,865 --> 00:55:03,708
Speaker 0: because I remember way back it's a 3d Mega Man but it doesn't look like Mega Man.

843
00:55:03,748 --> 00:55:07,184
Speaker 0: it looks like this weird stick blue guy and you have the camera behind Mega Man.

844
00:55:07,225 --> 00:55:11,039
Speaker 1: yep yep way back I bought when the ps1 came out.

845
00:55:11,661 --> 00:55:13,709
Speaker 1: I bought it not to play ps1 games.

846
00:55:13,749 --> 00:55:15,598
Speaker 0: in fact it was fun to play DDR.

847
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:16,483
Speaker 0: yes but you had that.

848
00:55:16,503 --> 00:55:17,388
Speaker 0: I remember you had that game.

849
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:17,931
Speaker 1: yes because it.

850
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:19,438
Speaker 1: basically I bought this ps1.

851
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:23,860
Speaker 1: I didn't own a single PlayStation game and I had no intention of ever owning a single.

852
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,027
Speaker 1: but we were at our IT.

853
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:25,932
Speaker 1: well I was at home.

854
00:55:25,952 --> 00:55:27,580
Speaker 1: it was the summer after our freshman year.

855
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,420
Speaker 1: yeah so I bought it at K Mart because it was on sale for a hundred.

856
00:55:31,722 --> 00:55:32,566
Speaker 0: working at Kmart.

857
00:55:32,868 --> 00:55:38,290
Speaker 1: yeah I was working construction at the Kmart which was that was an interesting summer.

858
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:40,016
Speaker 1: let me tell you this is the intercom phone.

859
00:55:40,718 --> 00:55:55,606
Speaker 1: huh you know knowing the intercom code at a Kmart and knowing that the intercom code is the same at every Kmart everywhere and knowing that nothing can be done to prevent you from doing something hilarious makes for a really fun summer you sure does.

860
00:55:55,827 --> 00:55:56,329
Speaker 1: but anyway.

861
00:55:56,349 --> 00:56:02,976
Speaker 1: so I bought this thing and I bought it solely to put up six pin mod chip in it so I could play import DDR games.

862
00:56:03,738 --> 00:56:07,672
Speaker 1: so uh I realized alright I've got this ps1 does it work?

863
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:13,114
Speaker 1: and then my follow-on was now that I put the mod chip in it does it still work?

864
00:56:13,615 --> 00:56:22,772
Speaker 1: so what I did is I went on winmx and I just looked for any ISO of ps1 game and I found Megaman something I'm like alright fine I download it I put it in.

865
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:26,967
Speaker 1: that was like the worst game I've ever touched it's not.

866
00:56:27,068 --> 00:56:30,306
Speaker 0: no maybe you never touch some of the worst ones but it's a really bad game.

867
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:30,850
Speaker 0: I played it.

868
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:40,956
Speaker 0: actually I had a friend who had a PlayStation one with the mod chip in the early days way back like we're talking my dad he was like this is what you spent two hours soldering for.

869
00:56:40,976 --> 00:56:42,221
Speaker 1: this looks like shit.

870
00:56:42,382 --> 00:56:42,763
Speaker 0: this is.

871
00:56:42,844 --> 00:56:45,919
Speaker 1: and I was like don't worry this wasn't what I bought this for.

872
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:51,440
Speaker 1: I bought it for a stupid dancing game the junior high school.

873
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,228
Speaker 0: he would go to blockbuster Brent PlayStation games.

874
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:55,493
Speaker 0: copy them to CD.

875
00:56:55,653 --> 00:56:56,537
Speaker 0: ours never turned them.

876
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,728
Speaker 0: that's how I played Megaman legends.

877
00:56:59,029 --> 00:57:04,514
Speaker 1: that's actually how I got all my DDR games when I found out that importing a DDR game was like 80 bucks.

878
00:57:04,936 --> 00:57:06,643
Speaker 1: so I signed up for our red octane.

879
00:57:06,683 --> 00:57:09,074
Speaker 0: red octane was still a game rental service.

880
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,562
Speaker 1: octane was just Netflix for games.

881
00:57:10,643 --> 00:57:18,253
Speaker 1: so basically I put in my queue every single mix of DDR ever released in Japan for the ps1 the every every week.

882
00:57:18,354 --> 00:57:21,771
Speaker 1: one would come I'd rip it and mail it back the same day and then I had all of them.

883
00:57:22,093 --> 00:57:28,565
Speaker 0: yep but I see there's also Megaman battle network which is sort of like this weird RPG ish game they got going on.

884
00:57:28,585 --> 00:57:33,012
Speaker 0: that is doesn't that really have much to do with Megaman except it's sort of like as much to do with the Megaman.

885
00:57:33,213 --> 00:57:35,582
Speaker 1: Megaman one was released on the IBM PC in 1990.

886
00:57:35,582 --> 00:57:38,875
Speaker 1: Megaman 3 was released on the IBM PC in 1991.

887
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:40,040
Speaker 0: how about that?

888
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:41,206
Speaker 0: how about that?

889
00:57:41,226 --> 00:57:43,961
Speaker 1: yeah because I had this memory like I said earlier and I just couldn't.

890
00:57:44,283 --> 00:57:47,019
Speaker 1: I was thinking about it and I couldn't fathom where it came from.

891
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:48,286
Speaker 0: Megaman X was on there too.

892
00:57:48,326 --> 00:57:51,462
Speaker 1: I had it yeah and Rockman strategy but only in China yeah.

893
00:57:51,482 --> 00:57:52,688
Speaker 0: so people don't realize this.

894
00:57:52,709 --> 00:57:53,733
Speaker 0: I guess that you know.

895
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:58,493
Speaker 0: you might know that in Japan Megaman is actually Rockman but I mean it's Rockman.

896
00:57:58,533 --> 00:58:06,375
Speaker 0: his sister role proto man's name is is what I think it's actually still proto man.

897
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:06,756
Speaker 0: I forget.

898
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:10,532
Speaker 0: I don't know I forget but yeah it's like everyone.

899
00:58:10,572 --> 00:58:14,347
Speaker 0: it's like rock roll bass treble it's like this whole music.

900
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:18,946
Speaker 0: you know theme going on and people don't seem to get that.

901
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,091
Speaker 0: you know this sort of like a joke.

902
00:58:20,132 --> 00:58:23,145
Speaker 0: there's all these Japanese puns in Megaman and sort of like.

903
00:58:23,406 --> 00:58:25,274
Speaker 0: we try we sort of get a dynamic.

904
00:58:25,796 --> 00:58:27,482
Speaker 0: what's it called dynamic?

905
00:58:27,543 --> 00:58:34,450
Speaker 0: equivalents going on with with the with the heat man and such like that where it's still the same sort of joke.

906
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:38,003
Speaker 0: everyone is called man but those are their their names.

907
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:40,412
Speaker 0: they also people don't remember that.

908
00:58:40,432 --> 00:58:41,899
Speaker 0: I think Megaman 4 was.

909
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:44,712
Speaker 0: you know people voted on what the robot masters.

910
00:58:44,732 --> 00:58:45,877
Speaker 0: was it a man or five?

911
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:52,748
Speaker 1: because I remember that contest in Nintendo power and I was so excited about it and I was like oh man I'm gonna win this.

912
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,621
Speaker 1: I forget what I submitted but I submitted something.

913
00:58:54,843 --> 00:58:55,467
Speaker 0: really see things.

914
00:58:55,487 --> 00:59:01,016
Speaker 0: I don't know how that worked right because wouldn't the Japanese decide what was the robot messages were gonna be?

915
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:02,204
Speaker 1: I didn't know either.

916
00:59:02,244 --> 00:59:08,046
Speaker 1: all I know is Nintendo power showed the a bunch of submissions and they were the dumbest things.

917
00:59:08,286 --> 00:59:09,049
Speaker 0: oh my god.

918
00:59:10,132 --> 00:59:11,562
Speaker 0: well what kind of submissions did you see?

919
00:59:11,663 --> 00:59:12,428
Speaker 1: I don't even remember.

920
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:14,516
Speaker 1: I just really in.

921
00:59:14,537 --> 00:59:15,460
Speaker 0: the game was pretty bad.

922
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,463
Speaker 0: I mean tomahawk man.

923
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:17,808
Speaker 0: oh man.

924
00:59:17,848 --> 00:59:23,407
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at Megaman 4 and Megaman 4 has a scary cover in America.

925
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:24,451
Speaker 1: I guess I never saw that's.

926
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:31,550
Speaker 0: the other thing is that look at the cover of say Megaman 2 is really it frightened me as a kid and I was like that's not what Megaman looks like.

927
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:35,555
Speaker 0: what's up with this is freaky but it's sort of freaky in this way where you can't look away.

928
00:59:36,037 --> 00:59:37,968
Speaker 0: Megaman 1 is even scarier.

929
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:39,092
Speaker 0: look at the shit.

930
00:59:39,132 --> 00:59:41,658
Speaker 1: Megaman 5 looks okay for Megaman 4.

931
00:59:41,658 --> 00:59:47,876
Speaker 0: go look at the box art of Megaman 1 and Megaman 2 in the United States.

932
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:49,702
Speaker 0: good guy.

933
00:59:49,782 --> 00:59:51,749
Speaker 1: hey compared to Megaman 4 I don't know.

934
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:55,485
Speaker 1: cuz I can deal with Megaman 1 which I'm looking at right now.

935
00:59:56,248 --> 00:59:58,782
Speaker 1: he's holding that gun really weird and I don't like his biceps one.

936
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:02,117
Speaker 0: it totally looks like a Logan runs or Tron kind of thing.

937
01:00:02,418 --> 01:00:04,385
Speaker 1: Logan's run Logan.

938
01:00:04,445 --> 01:00:05,128
Speaker 1: Logan didn't run.

939
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:09,824
Speaker 0: more than that kind of styling of you know 70s 80s sci-fi movie cover.

940
01:00:10,426 --> 01:00:12,333
Speaker 0: but Megaman 2 is even weird.

941
01:00:12,374 --> 01:00:17,555
Speaker 1: it's pretty much every Megaman cover up until 5 in America looks stupid and weird.

942
01:00:17,575 --> 01:00:23,515
Speaker 0: Oh Megaman 3 looked okay yeah but anyway I guess we could talk about Megaman all.

943
01:00:23,535 --> 01:00:24,499
Speaker 1: no look at his face.

944
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:26,045
Speaker 1: look at Megaman's face.

945
01:00:26,828 --> 01:00:28,193
Speaker 1: that is not cool.

946
01:00:28,213 --> 01:00:30,439
Speaker 0: anyway that's fine.

947
01:00:30,479 --> 01:00:31,281
Speaker 0: Megaman 3 is alright.

948
01:00:31,382 --> 01:00:33,107
Speaker 0: no yeah it is.

949
01:00:33,688 --> 01:00:34,451
Speaker 0: but anyway yeah there's.

950
01:00:34,471 --> 01:00:36,446
Speaker 0: I don't know what else you can say about Megaman.

951
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:36,788
Speaker 0: what's your?

952
01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:38,035
Speaker 0: what's your favorite robot master?

953
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:40,165
Speaker 1: I would have to be a quick man.

954
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:41,692
Speaker 0: you think quick man's your baby.

955
01:00:41,712 --> 01:00:42,575
Speaker 1: he was the coolest.

956
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:44,985
Speaker 1: he looked the coolest level the best weapon.

957
01:00:45,005 --> 01:00:48,721
Speaker 0: the coolest might be Gemini or magnet man.

958
01:00:48,942 --> 01:00:52,595
Speaker 1: Gemini man at the best music but I actually do.

959
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:59,716
Speaker 0: my favorite level would probably be like the music you were just singing there I think with shadow man.

960
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:01,484
Speaker 1: I thought that was Gemini man.

961
01:01:01,504 --> 01:01:04,276
Speaker 0: I don't remember his Gemini man.

962
01:01:04,356 --> 01:01:04,878
Speaker 0: I might be.

963
01:01:05,019 --> 01:01:06,244
Speaker 1: I'll bet you a dollar.

964
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:08,031
Speaker 0: maybe what was shadow man?

965
01:01:08,071 --> 01:01:08,674
Speaker 0: that I forget.

966
01:01:09,256 --> 01:01:10,662
Speaker 0: but yeah it's really tough.

967
01:01:10,762 --> 01:01:11,766
Speaker 0: I like bubble man.

968
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,650
Speaker 0: he's way cool.

969
01:01:12,771 --> 01:01:13,675
Speaker 0: his levels way cool.

970
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:15,323

Speaker 0: that's pretty awesome.

974
01:01:17,192 --> 01:01:21,938
Speaker 1: I love crash man's weapon even though it's not really that useful except for getting through things.

975
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:23,908
Speaker 0: yeah well it was a boss or two.

976
01:01:23,968 --> 01:01:26,600
