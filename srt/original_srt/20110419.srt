13
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:50,972
Speaker 0: I remember very clearly because it was on TV many many times.

14
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:52,619
Speaker 0: I think I was sick and I just kept seeing it.

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,035
Speaker 0: It's the one where he's Pete as opposed to Pete is mowing the side of the freeway.

16
00:00:58,215 --> 00:00:59,499
Speaker 0: Yep, trying to blow up cars.

00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:02,144

00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:04,652
Speaker 1: Oh my god classic the roof stack.

20
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:06,900
Speaker 0: I think I really like the one with the lunar eclipse.

21
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:08,517
Speaker 1: No, he has a good one, too.

22
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:11,928
Speaker 1: Or the the times the daylight savings time.

23
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,577
Speaker 0: Oh, but he's trying to race and stay in the same time.

24
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:21,291
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, so, you know, I always say right that You know, it's like I got a big trade-off, right?

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:28,080
Speaker 1: It's like aha all these people in the world They suffer from chronic back pain, but I will not suffer from pain.

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,567
Speaker 1: I will have a hunch instead.

27
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:31,296
Speaker 1: but be pain-free until maybe I'm old.

28
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:33,531
Speaker 0: but Scott I point out I'm also pain-free.

29
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:34,539
Speaker 0: nor do I have a hunch?

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,107
Speaker 1: I'm just saying neither what.

31
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:39,867
Speaker 0: it's possible to have no hunch And do not have back pain.

32
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:43,140
Speaker 0: the people who have back pain don't have it for their lack of hunching.

33
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:47,039
Speaker 0: They have it because they don't bend their knees.

34
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,656
Speaker 1: But anyway, I have suffered my first back pain.

35
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:55,450
Speaker 0: Oh back injury You know, it's funny because I did hurt my back my entire life.

36
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:56,834
Speaker 1: It is now I have.

37
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,741
Speaker 0: now it is hurting Scott You know what?

38
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,786
Speaker 0: This means we're officially old.

39
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:04,916
Speaker 0: Oh, no because my whole life I would like fall off cliffs.

40
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:09,273
Speaker 0: bicycle spoke through the leg Cushion and I never like.

41
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,620
Speaker 0: I just bounced back like the next day.

42
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:23,990
Speaker 0: I'd be fine Yeah, and then you know last week when I got food poisoning and I fell over backwards vomiting so hard that I threw my back out My back hurt for like two weeks really - we okay Cuz like I don't know I didn't actually do.

43
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,540
Speaker 1: at least remember doing anything that injured the back, right?

44
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:27,124
Speaker 1: But it's like.

45
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:29,056
Speaker 0: I know exactly what you did but nothing.

46
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:30,901
Speaker 0: hunching It's.

47
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,788
Speaker 1: but the thing is it's on the low back.

48
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,354
Speaker 1: It's not in the upper hunch area.

49
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:35,980
Speaker 1: It's like way low.

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,350
Speaker 1: It's like where my tail would be if I had a tail.

51
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:40,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's where most back pain ends up being.

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, it's like you know where you should go Spock hassle.

53
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:47,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz my back pain actually went away completely after Spock hassle.

54
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could definitely use something like that cuz they.

55
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:51,260
Speaker 0: I mean there's some Randy in there.

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,719
Speaker 0: You gotta stay away from the Randy, but there's also just jets of water that pound your back for free.

57
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:56,664
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll take that.

58
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:57,006
Speaker 1: Yeah.

59
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:57,307
Speaker 1: Yeah.

60
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:00,664
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's like I woke up like a couple mornings ago And it was just not good.

61
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:04,180
Speaker 1: And then I went to bed last night and I woke up and it was still not good.

62
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:04,822
Speaker 1: I was like what.

63
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,708
Speaker 0: that's the first sign of being old.

64
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:10,200
Speaker 0: when there's pain that is there one day and it's still there.

65
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,446
Speaker 0: Then it's like usually.

66
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:14,279
Speaker 1: usually you're gonna go to bed and wake up and it's gonna be gone.

67
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:23,357
Speaker 0: I think the primary example of youth is that when I was a kid like when I would get hangovers like okay I got a hangover in the morning afternoon fine or really sick feeling.

68
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:26,153
Speaker 0: go to sleep You'll feel a hundred percent like new the next day.

69
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,360
Speaker 0: It's not true anymore.

70
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:28,243
Speaker 1: No, I'm gonna.

71
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:31,536
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do big sleep if I still have it for anime.

72
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:32,320
Speaker 1: Boston's gonna be trouble.

73
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:34,972
Speaker 1: I gotta carry my luggage around now.

74
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:37,663
Speaker 0: You should get wheely luggage Like a sissy.

75
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:43,560
Speaker 1: you mean like everyone who travels except one see the thing is the people with wheely luggage are permanent sissies.

76
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,386
Speaker 1: I'm only a part-time sissy.

77
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:47,694
Speaker 1: I have been temporarily sissified.

78
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:51,570
Speaker 1: as soon as I'm getting rid of this pain I will no longer need really like.

79
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,603
Speaker 0: I point out that had you had wheely luggage You might not have slammed into that obstacle Shows.

80
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:00,413
Speaker 1: even less of a sissy I am.

81
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:04,624
Speaker 1: I get slammed right into an obstacle breaker of Infrastructure.

82
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:07,858
Speaker 0: I will continue to use my wheely luggage sissy.

83
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,497

Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, I'm sad, but the trains are nice at least.

100
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:06,650
Speaker 0: So only it won't be that long till we find out who's in Jane McGonigal's take or fight the future find the future That event we talked about that thing of the day, so yeah, I applied.

101
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,420
Speaker 0: I think tomorrow is the last day to apply.

102
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,268
Speaker 0: All right, so if you want to be in that game you'd better apply now.

103
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:17,699
Speaker 1: Well, I mean anyone can play.

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,192
Speaker 0: It's just if you want to be overnight do if you want to be one of the immortal 500.

105
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:26,847
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway Is that it for opening bits?

106
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,573
Speaker 0: I guess you're supposed to.

107
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:30,260
Speaker 0: we're supposed to have a smooth transition.

108
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,950
Speaker 1: Well, you know after hundreds of smooth transitions.

109
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,700
Speaker 1: We can have one non smooth transition now.

110
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,468
Speaker 0: So that'll be the thing.

111
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:39,384
Speaker 0: non smooth transition It can be.

112
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,034
Speaker 1: it can be smooth in its lack of smoothness.

113
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:42,858
Speaker 1: It's gonna be smooth.

114
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:47,573
Speaker 0: intentionally Unsmooth you mean like when black dynamite glances up at that microphone.

115
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:49,438
Speaker 0: That's hanging down from the boom in shot.

116
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:49,900
Speaker 1: That's right.

117
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:55,331
Speaker 1: So I got sort of a news slash geek bite together.

118
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:58,860
Speaker 1: right there's this game that came out called the ace of spades.

119
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:01,493
Speaker 0: Ah the game that we couldn't get the server working.

120
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,646
Speaker 1: I've gotten it to work a few times I mean last.

121
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,635
Speaker 0: I thought I didn't get that.

122
00:06:04,676 --> 00:06:09,320
Speaker 1: well I didn't get the server to work personally, but I've played it on someone else's server a few times.

123
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,619
Speaker 0: So how come they can get it working, but you can I?

124
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:20,454
Speaker 1: Because they were at RIT Yeah, but anyway my Counter-Strike servers still broken.

125
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:22,420
Speaker 0: so yeah, I get something running anyway.

126
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:25,399
Speaker 1: So this game basically is the kind of thing I've been asking for.

127
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,054
Speaker 1: It's basically that the core concept of it is very strong.

128
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:30,660
Speaker 1: this game has good fundamentals, right?

129
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,041
Speaker 1: Which is?

130
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:36,900
Speaker 1: it's like Minecraft you can break blocks and you can put blocks and you can put blocks of any color you want.

131
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:38,680
Speaker 1: Right and every block is just a block.

132
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,532
Speaker 1: There's no difference between one block and another block.

133
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:51,008
Speaker 1: everything is just the same And you also have a gun Right and the gun kills people and both sides of the map have an intelligence that you're trying to protect And you're also trying to capture the other guys.

134
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:52,496
Speaker 1: intelligence right.

135
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:57,806
Speaker 1: so Fundamentally, it's capture the flag with blocks Which is pretty damn good.

136
00:06:57,826 --> 00:07:05,812
Speaker 1: the problem with the game is that it has some mechanic you know Technological shortcomings right in that the networking you know fails.

137
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,940
Speaker 0: Why does no one get this right?

138
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,072
Speaker 1: Understand the thing is they've actually gotten it right into where.

139
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:15,840
Speaker 1: once the server is working properly And you're connected to it properly it does work really well.

140
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,015
Speaker 0: I actually heard a lot of people complaining about the fact that there's no sort of.

141
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:26,880
Speaker 0: it appears that there's no Prediction of movement that you have to lead your shots based on lag not based on movement.

142
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:32,120
Speaker 1: Well if there is someone who is incredibly laggy, then yes, you do have to maybe figure it out.

143
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:44,134
Speaker 0: I've always been of the mind and maybe it's just because I've never in my life Had a high ping that if you have to choose between punishing the high ping bastards and the low ping bastards Fuck the high ping bastards.

144
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:44,700
Speaker 1: That's right.

145
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:52,123
Speaker 1: You should punish the lag guy not the not the guy with no leg, but anyway the thing is the gun in the game is actually Stupidly accurate.

146
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:54,088
Speaker 1: like there is no scatter or cone shot.

147
00:07:54,129 --> 00:08:02,464
Speaker 1: you click and the bullet goes infinitely in that direction that you clicked precisely where the crosshair was and Immediately so you shit.

148
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:08,622
Speaker 1: you click to style you click on a guy and as soon as you click blood pops out of him like Right.

149
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:10,348
Speaker 1: It's like if you click on him you got him.

150
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:11,873
Speaker 1: the gun is a sniper rifle.

151
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:14,583
Speaker 1: That is has no you know There's no recoil.

152
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:19,100
Speaker 1: There's no nothing right and it has a slow rate of fire, but you can just like bam bam.

153
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,259
Speaker 1: And so the problem is the game has fog.

154
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:28,198
Speaker 1: So the thing is if you can see someone through the fog you can shoot him But if they're if you can't see them it becomes hard to shoot him.

155
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:29,344
Speaker 1: But eat.

156
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,602
Speaker 1: don't let that fool you though because sometimes you won't see someone through the fog But you'll.

157
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:44,207
Speaker 1: they'll see you when you were in the fog and you'll recede into the fog thinking you ran away from them But they just keep shooting right where they last saw you Because ammo is basically almost infinite.

158
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:47,820
Speaker 0: god if we didn't have anime Boston coming up I would have been playing some of that.

159
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,720
Speaker 1: No, I'd be playing portal to which I only was able to play one chapter.

160
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,580
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but it's only gonna take us eight hours to beat portal.

161
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,600
Speaker 1: Well, you got to play it twice because it's a co-op game and a single-player game.

162
00:08:56,961 --> 00:09:02,016
Speaker 0: I heard I heard eight hours for single-player and then another four or five for the co-op whatever.

163
00:09:02,036 --> 00:09:13,078
Speaker 1: It's quality hours Yeah, anyway, but yeah ace of spades the game has some you know problems in its details You know when it's technology, and it definitely needs a lot more polishing and embellishing.

164
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:21,357
Speaker 0: well I would say that the the problems that appears to have by and large are very similar to the problems that were never solved in The old quick two mods that I like.

165
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:24,050
Speaker 1: yeah But the fundamentals of the game are very sound.

166
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,600
Speaker 1: and the thing is I'm already seeing emerging gameplay for example.

167
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:27,873
Speaker 1: It's just one example.

168
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:28,399
Speaker 1: then we'll move on.

169
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:33,420
Speaker 1: When you're hoping you you you start with 50 blocks and you can place blocks wherever you want.

170
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,199
Speaker 1: Right and you can make the blocks any color you want.

171
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:46,020
Speaker 1: so what you can do is you can right-click on any block on the screen and Then it'll change the color of the block you're holding to match the color of the block you clicked.

172
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:55,358
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and there's a mini map in the game that you press M to look at the map And it gives you a basically a perfect overhead view of the game.

173
00:09:55,479 --> 00:10:01,120
Speaker 1: perfect All right, so you see pretty much every pixel of the whole map from a directly straight down overhead view.

174
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,940
Speaker 1: So the intelligence on the map is like a blue square or a green square.

175
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:08,875
Speaker 1: So lay down some blocks in a blue square or a green square of the same dimensions.

176
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:14,053
Speaker 1: and now the other team sees two Intelligences and if they're stupid they don't know which one is which that is.

177
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:16,020
Speaker 0: that is right up there with my bro.

178
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:17,567
Speaker 1: See another example.

179
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:20,480
Speaker 1: right go to where you to make bridges to go over the water faster.

180
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:23,120
Speaker 1: Right because swimming in the water is kind of slow and troublesome.

181
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:27,460
Speaker 1: But if you make a bridge then you're in business But you don't want the other team to see where your bridges are.

182
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:38,574
Speaker 1: So what you do is when you're making a bridge you jump in the water and you make every brick of the bridge you Use the right-click to make it the same color as the water underneath and you get Indiana Jones bridges Yeah, and no one can see them on the map.

183
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:39,480
Speaker 1: It just looks like water.

184
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:46,660
Speaker 1: But when your team actually is standing right there It's pretty easy to see the bridge from the side just like the Indiana Jones bridge is easy to see from the side.

185
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:48,304
Speaker 0: See I love it's.

186
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:57,059
Speaker 0: I realized that I like first generation emergent gameplay, but I often dislike second-generation simulacra of emergent gameplay.

187
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:02,560
Speaker 0: La I think the best example is bunny hopping was kind of a fluke in early quake games.

188
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:04,579
Speaker 1: But but you don't like skiing and tribes.

189
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:10,120
Speaker 0: Well, but that thing is skiing in tribes like bunny hopping was at least like it was done.

190
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:11,979
Speaker 0: Well, but it's very hard to do that.

191
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:21,424
Speaker 0: Most games that try to simulate some sort of errant or emergent behavior from previous games end up duplicating it perfectly rather than Duplicating the intent.

192
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:25,356
Speaker 0: and when you duplicate it perfectly you get here is a fucking new earth.

193
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:28,006
Speaker 1: Yep Anyway, so what you got?

194
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,917
Speaker 0: So the nation of Armenia has what is it?

195
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:31,680
Speaker 1: Are they playing games?

196
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,562
Speaker 1: What is it?

197
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:38,240
Speaker 0: they have decided that chess is now compulsory in all primary education schools.

198
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:40,894
Speaker 0: Chess is a class just like math and everything else.

199
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:41,900
Speaker 0: That's okay.

200
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:43,824
Speaker 0: Here's what I want to say.

201
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:46,032
Speaker 0: I think the concept is great.

202
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:48,260
Speaker 1: I think that game chess is the wrong choice.

203
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:50,188
Speaker 0: Let me finish that.

204
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:52,740
Speaker 0: games and analytical thinking and things like this.

205
00:11:53,282 --> 00:12:00,888
Speaker 0: I feel like a lot of students in school learn more innately from their music classes their art classes Their chess classes.

206
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:04,487
Speaker 0: then they do from a lot of their math and science Even if they don't learn it directly.

207
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:07,880
Speaker 1: being in those classes has been shown in many studies to enhance.

208
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:09,739
Speaker 1: You know what you learn in the other classes.

209
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:12,570
Speaker 1: You're in band, you know, you're gonna learn.

210
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:18,171
Speaker 1: you're gonna be smarter and learn more in math, you know Even though you you know might not necessarily learn about music more.

211
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,917
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly what I was saying.

212
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:33,298
Speaker 0: So But gaming in particular I mean remember Jane McGonigal's talk from Pax and what a lot of researchers say time and time again that play is One of the primary methods that mammals learn anything.

213
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:37,480
Speaker 0: Yep I mean, it's the way that hunting instincts and predation instincts are passed on.

214
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,960
Speaker 1: Are you saying you want a school where people do nothing but play games all day?

215
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Speaker 0: I'm saying that gaming needs to be more tightly integrated with education.

216
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,149
Speaker 0: Of course, and I've been saying that for a long time and every now and then we get a tiny Glimmer, I mean someone who gets it.

217
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,080
Speaker 1: It wasn't completely absent from our education.

218
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,911
Speaker 1: We played Oregon Trail and you know all sorts of stuff.

219
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,080
Speaker 0: We never played Oregon Trail officially.

220
00:12:56,241 --> 00:13:00,180
Speaker 0: It was just there in the computer lab and the smart kids played it instead of doing their work.

221
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,617
Speaker 1: No gaming was there in my schooling from nursery school to 12th grade.

222
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,340
Speaker 0: There was games going on but not as much as there should be not as tightly integrated with the education.

223
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,843
Speaker 0: It was nothing.

224
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:12,920
Speaker 1: there could have been very active there could have been more but there was still plenty of gaming.

225
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,185
Speaker 1: I mean word munchers in kindergarten.

226
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,199
Speaker 0: I mean was your assignment to play Oregon Trail or was it just on the computer?

227
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:22,577
Speaker 1: No, I'm pretty sure it was just on the computer, but there was nothing to do on the computer but play games.

228
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:28,360
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, usually they'd give you some assignment like alright type this document in this word processor.

229
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,757
Speaker 0: I never just sit there.

230
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:36,767
Speaker 0: So all the smart kids would just go to the shared drive get the document the teacher typed up Send it back to him and then play games for an hour.

231
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:42,880
Speaker 0: Mmm, but the thing I take issue with is that They're about 50 years too late.

232
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,220
Speaker 0: I don't think chess is the game that should be used because I don't think chess is a good teaching tool at all.

233
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,966
Speaker 0: No chess is too abstract.

234
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:58,520
Speaker 1: if there's too high of a barrier to skilled play I think the reason they're doing it is they just want to have an Armenian be like the chess champion of the world.

235
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,627
Speaker 1: They don't want to miss anybody.

236
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:00,734
Speaker 1: That's all about national.

237
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:03,573
Speaker 0: I Actually think it's a little deeper than that.

238
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:11,120
Speaker 0: I think that there's a recognition I mean most people associate chess with smart people that people who play chess tend to be smart.

239
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,321
Speaker 0: They.

240
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:14,640
Speaker 0: they know that chess is an abstraction of war that there's strategy involved.

241
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:24,200
Speaker 0: It has all the trappings of the things you would actually want to teach children on a fundamental level But it does self-reliance analytical thinking and it does have all those things.

242
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:29,320
Speaker 0: I just don't think it is nearly as good a teaching tool as say a lot of the German style board games.

243
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,506
Speaker 1: Of course, why don't they?

244
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:39,280
Speaker 1: what they should do is I don't understand how you're gonna have a required class But for every possible grade, so you're gonna play chess as a class every year for your whole schooling from campus.

245
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:41,008
Speaker 0: I don't know the exact details of it.

246
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:43,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's like that's a lot of chess to be playing.

247
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,139
Speaker 1: Why don't you they should mix it up?

248
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,173
Speaker 1: There should be basically game class where you play serious games of all sorts.

249
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:53,648
Speaker 0: go chess Puerto Rico I would just call the class strategy.

250
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:55,934
Speaker 1: That's a good class or analytical thinking.

251
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:56,496
Speaker 1: Why not?

252
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:57,740
Speaker 1: Sure go for it.

253
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:02,500
Speaker 0: Yeah portal Do but I mean we did a panel on this.

254
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,074
Speaker 0: But basically I think my main argument the reason why chess and go don't work.

255
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:10,484
Speaker 0: and the same reason why a lot of video games Don't actually work.

256
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:21,000
Speaker 0: and sports and everything is that these particular types of board games the not wholly abstracted You know German or euro style games tend to be very focused and tend to reduce randomness.

257
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:45,459
Speaker 0: but more importantly because of the mechanical constraints of the game and the fact that they are a Kind of direct analogy of the real world You can hold the entire state of the game in your head to a reasonable degree that the like the actual number of different decisions you're making is Fairly constrained and you can have a board game that you teach to kids Where they play it and the smarter of them will solve it by the end of the class.

258
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:55,780
Speaker 0: And I think there's a lot more actual learning going on at least practical learning because chess will teach you to be a better chess player and Maybe it'll teach you some pattern recognition.

259
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,743
Speaker 0: But I don't know.

260
00:15:56,763 --> 00:16:01,157
Speaker 0: playing modern art will teach you evaluation and mind reading and all sort of fighters.

261
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:03,345
Speaker 1: Street Fighter is important Starcraft why not?

262
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:05,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Street Fighter and Starcraft?

263
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:16,399
Speaker 0: because they're not mechanical They're more mathematically complex and have a much broader Decision matrix in them and as a result I think they're less good as direct teaching tools because there's no.

264
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:21,460
Speaker 0: The answer key is not as useful to a student's progress as it is in say, Puerto Rico.

265
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,770
Speaker 1: It will if you want to actually produce people who are gonna be professional gamers.

266
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,380
Speaker 0: I think that should be a separate branch of education.

267
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:31,028
Speaker 1: Hey, they have a gym classes required.

268
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:32,392
Speaker 1: They're trying to make professional athlete.

269
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:33,877
Speaker 0: No, they're not trying to make professional.

270
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:34,740
Speaker 1: Maybe they should.

271
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:38,419
Speaker 1: You got to start young if you want even have a chance.

272
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:48,038
Speaker 0: so things of the day hobo Nichols.

273
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,189
Speaker 0: Nichols made by hobos.

274
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:53,640
Speaker 1: Oh, they took nickel and they minted it.

275
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:58,682
Speaker 0: Possibly do that in the early part of the 1900s.

276
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:10,064
Speaker 0: there be there's a movement of not really a movement but kind of an art form that was popularized Called the hobo nickel where people would take Nichols particularly later on via that Buffalo nickel and just carve Reliefs into them.

277
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:11,047
Speaker 0: make them so kind of.

278
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:17,153
Speaker 1: you need a pretty serious tool to carve into the nickel right with any efficiency No more than you need for any sort of metal sculpting.

279
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:18,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, what would you use like a chisel?

280
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,542
Speaker 1: It's like would you?

281
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:22,579
Speaker 0: yeah nowadays people use dremels and things but a dremel would work.

282
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:24,166
Speaker 0: I mean hobos did this Scott.

283
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,051
Speaker 0: It's not that hard.

284
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:28,165
Speaker 0: Nichols are actually not that Strong either.

285
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:29,471
Speaker 1: they never actually tried to.

286
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:31,058
Speaker 0: you know, try to deface a nickel.

287
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:35,037
Speaker 0: It won't take you I could deface a nickel with a dime if I really wanted.

288
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:37,992
Speaker 0: I don't know I'm right here.

289
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:38,718
Speaker 0: So I'll work on that.

290
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:49,777
Speaker 0: Anyway hobo Nichols are Often actually made by hobos and there's a whole like hobby of collecting them and making them.

291
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:52,507
Speaker 1: and this crazy story Yeah hobos do lots of stuff like that.

292
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:55,058
Speaker 1: cuz you know your hobo you don't there are you don't have anything to do.

293
00:17:55,118 --> 00:18:02,060
Speaker 1: so something That takes a long time like, you know Scratching a nickel to put draw a picture on it is gonna be perfect.

294
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:07,173
Speaker 0: There is the era of the classic hobo Nichols from 1913 to 1940. then there was the later era.

295
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,167
Speaker 1: So what about the other?

296
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:12,715
Speaker 1: so the hobo who made one in 1941 his doesn't count?

297
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,024
Speaker 0: No, this is the later era.

298
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,115
Speaker 0: and then 1980 onward is the modern era.

299
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:19,843
Speaker 1: what happened in 1940?

300
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:20,831
Speaker 1: Changed the hobos.

301
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:21,960
Speaker 0: Oh, let's find out.

302
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:31,402
Speaker 0: So in the original era in the 30s and on there was a guy named Bert and he had a student named Oh and Burton Bo.

303
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:37,446
Speaker 0: these hobos carved all the kind of canonical Hobo Nichols, so there were.

304
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:39,634
Speaker 1: so basically they were only two hobos who were in the game.

305
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:41,440
Speaker 0: Well, don't know they're the famous ones.

306
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,379
Speaker 0: There are many other people but these two were like well known.

307
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:55,100
Speaker 0: Okay, so in the 40s 50s 60s 70s onward That was a transitional period for hobo engravers because the Buffalo nickel was gradually replaced by the Jefferson nickel.

308
00:18:56,141 --> 00:19:09,500
Speaker 0: the Buffalo nickel was apparently it was widely regarded as being too ugly when it was new and Too ugly when it was worn down and therefore always ugly, but it was a good medium for a hobo carving.

309
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:12,210
Speaker 0: So the Jefferson nickel wasn't as good.

310
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,324
Speaker 0: so people had to do very different things to the nickels They made different.

311
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:16,609
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's so it's.

312
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,946
Speaker 1: it's not the year that you carved it that makes the difference It's the nickel you used.

313
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:30,026
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's that the types of hobo nickels that were made transition because the kinds of nickels that existed were different and Like art styles were different.

314
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:33,280
Speaker 0: Apparently a lot of people made Chinese women and hippies.

315
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,899
Speaker 0: Modern hobo nickels are made mostly with dremels and a lot of people disdain them saying that only old hobo nickels count.

316
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,129
Speaker 1: Oh you don't rim you.

317
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:49,242
Speaker 1: I see you painted this fabulous painting and it's so incredibly fabulous But you know what?

318
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:51,533
Speaker 1: It doesn't count because you use paint from the paint store.

319
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:52,498
Speaker 1: You weren't like Van Gogh.

320
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:55,096
Speaker 0: Yeah There's the original hobo society.

321
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:03,620
Speaker 0: They will like do research on and certify because apparently there's a problem where people will make fake hobo nickels and sell them to collectors.

322
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:06,948
Speaker 0: Well for five cents Hundreds thousands of dollars.

323
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:09,036
Speaker 1: who would pay hundreds of thousand dollars for a nickel?

324
00:20:09,437 --> 00:20:14,020
Speaker 0: your moron What if it's a car meets a piece of art just like a painting and that pay it doesn't matter.

325
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:19,079
Speaker 1: I don't think it's worth that much money for a nickel, but it's not a nickel anymore.

326
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,551
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter how fast it needs to be in this shape of a.

327
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:24,213
Speaker 1: I don't care.

328
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:27,865
Speaker 1: if Michelangelo carved the fucking nickel It's not worth a hundred thousand.

329
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,136
Speaker 0: I would pay a hundred thousand dollars for a nickel carved by Michelangelo.

330
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:32,686
Speaker 1: I would pay maybe 1000. you know why?

331
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:43,166
Speaker 0: Because I could sell it for way more than a hundred thousand Museum because it belongs in a museum.

332
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:48,300
Speaker 1: I'm just saying if Michelangelo had a hoe and a buffalo nickel that is some serious crazy.

333
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:51,066
Speaker 1: So how the hell did he get it?

334
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:55,360
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is merely the existence of hobo nickels.

335
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,265
Speaker 0: I suggest you check these out.

336
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:57,847
Speaker 0: All right.

337
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,451

339
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:09,439
Speaker 0: not a hater.

340
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,029
Speaker 0: All right, really the hater implies that the hate is probably unwarranted.

341
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,000
Speaker 1: those games where shit as you can see haters gonna hate.

342
00:21:17,482 --> 00:21:19,509

343
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,300
Speaker 0: Yeah before those existed, you know what I had before them.

344
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,682
Speaker 0: You know what?

345
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:31,020

346
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:32,911

Speaker 0: Anyway, they were way overpriced for what they were.

351
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:48,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were like 10 bucks.

352

356
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:16,726

Speaker 0: see now things like that are fun.

362
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,280
Speaker 0: I enjoy playing like kind of like old electro mechanical arcade games or a lot of vintage arcade games.

363
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:35,602
Speaker 0: They're not.

364
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:37,412
Speaker 1: so these are okay now that they're old.

365
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:40,331
Speaker 0: No, they're not actually fun But they are actually fun.

366
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:46,856
Speaker 0: if I'd been a kid I would not have enjoyed playing some of the games that are lauded as you know modern like.

367
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:48,000
Speaker 0: oh check out this class.

368
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:54,580
Speaker 0: But there's still an interesting experience in playing an old game just to see what it was like.

369
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,063
Speaker 0: But you know what?

370
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:57,719
Speaker 0: You're not gonna have fun playing these shitty tiger LCD.

371
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,068
Speaker 1: You're gonna have plenty of fun playing these games.

372
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:01,935
Speaker 1: play some Bartman Avenger of Evil.

373
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:03,420
Speaker 1: play some terminate.

374
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:05,975
Speaker 1: They got the electronic that terminate.

375

Speaker 1: take a g-man.

376
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,271
Speaker 1: All kinds of good games going on here.

377
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:10,659
Speaker 1: The Zelda ones actually really good.

378
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:21,700
Speaker 1: but yeah if you either too young to have ever seen these games or had them or maybe you're old and you have nostalgia for them or You're really old and you were too old to have them when you were a kid.

379
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:22,907
Speaker 1: Go to this site.

380
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:25,240
Speaker 1: play a bunch of these awesome games, they're awesome.

381
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:30,235
Speaker 0: So in much more important news, I deface the fuck out of this nickel with this dime.

382
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:31,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, let me see that nickel.

383
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,803
Speaker 0: I mean, I didn't.

384
00:23:32,884 --> 00:23:38,020
Speaker 0: I just did a little bit of scratching and look I put some surprisingly deep scratches in it none whatsoever.

385
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:41,316
Speaker 1: It looks like Jefferson to me.

386
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,763
Speaker 1: So you minorly scratched Jefferson's collar.

387
00:23:53,984 --> 00:23:54,968
Speaker 0: Yeah in like two seconds.

388
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:58,160
Speaker 0: All I was saying is that it's not that hard to deface a nickel.

389
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:01,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay But try how long is it gonna take you to put an art in it and replace?

390
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,955
Speaker 0: Jefferson completely about as long as it takes to do any soft metal carving.

391
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:10,965
Speaker 1: I Think if you heat it up a little bit or used a better tool like a dremel It would take a lot less.

392
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:13,180
Speaker 0: I wasn't saying you should carve it with a dime.

393
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,209
Speaker 0: I'm just saying I trivially defaced it with a dime.

394
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,055
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'll bet in about ten minutes.

395
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:19,460
Speaker 0: I could remove Jefferson's nose.

396
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what I could remove nose nose.

397
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,675
Speaker 1: I could remove instantly.

398
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:24,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, thanks.

399
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:27,684
Speaker 0: I Argue that you cannot.

400
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,494
Speaker 1: how can I not cuz it's already removed.

401
00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:30,996
Speaker 1: That's right.

402
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:32,060
Speaker 1: That's how I did it so fast.

403
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:34,548
Speaker 0: So, how can you remove it?

404
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:36,294
Speaker 0: undertake the action of removing it?

405
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:36,716
Speaker 0: I did.

406
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:37,980
Speaker 0: No, it was removed prior.

407
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,471
Speaker 0: You did not remove you did nothing.

408
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:44,439
Speaker 1: How do you know I didn't do it Because Michelangelo said anyway.

409
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,773
Speaker 0: So metamoment very briefly we will be this weekend at anime Boston.

438
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:22,217

440
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,799
Speaker 1: I'm just saying people show up at these things.

441
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we but we should.

442
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:31,414
Speaker 0: but we tell them because we tell them to yeah But the things we're at how many of them show up to the things we're not?

443
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:32,157
Speaker 1: and you don't know.

444
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:34,085
Speaker 1: we'd have to go to Those things to find out wouldn't we?

445
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:35,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, but why tell them to go then?

446
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:37,500
Speaker 1: because they're cool things.

447
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:39,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, but why not just have a link to it?

448
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,832
Speaker 0: I don't think that many people are going to things we tell them to go to Especially since they listen to the episodes often way after we made them.

449
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:48,199
Speaker 1: Anyway, and when's the next board game night?

450
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:54,778
Speaker 0: is May 13th the same night as of the nerd night that they want us to go present beyond candy land ad.

451
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:55,200
Speaker 0: so we got it.

452
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:56,639
Speaker 1: Oh, are we actually scheduled to do that?

453
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,554
Speaker 0: Uh, we weren't but we didn't go to two in a row and then they got emailed.

454
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:01,725
Speaker 0: me is like hey you guys want to Present so we'll see.

455
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,307
Speaker 0: All right.

456
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:04,900
Speaker 1: Well, I guess if we're presenting that's more important than board games.

457
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:07,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I really want to play board games is my trouble.

458
00:27:07,672 --> 00:27:09,480
Speaker 1: I can go present it with my never-ending trouble.

459
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:11,248
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't need you to be on candy land.

460
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,896
Speaker 0: I actually I just did a cuz.

461
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,705
Speaker 0: remember it's a shorter We have like 20 minutes.

462
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:17,320
Speaker 1: Oh, we only have 20 minutes, but I had to redo the whole fucking thing.

463
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, I already redid it.

464
00:27:18,526 --> 00:27:18,767
Speaker 1: Yeah.

465
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I ran it for a bunch of people at work.

466
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:23,251
Speaker 0: I ran beyond candy land like four times.

467
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:24,640
Speaker 0: Okay for various audiences.

468
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:32,308
Speaker 0: Anyway, the only meta news that's really pertinent to geek nights other than the fact that we're doing a bunch of panels at anime Boston and we'll be playing a bunch of games there.

469
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:39,260
Speaker 0: Is that the book club book is still Foundation by Asimov, you know the one of the great nerd books.

470
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:45,076
Speaker 1: Yes of all time that I sadly admittedly have not actually read and also follow me on Twitter.

471
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,831
Speaker 0: APR ECHE You could follow geek nights on Twitter.

472
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:50,740
Speaker 1: You can do that too, but I want more followers.

473
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,528
Speaker 1: Why cuz somebody else had more file.

474
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:52,990
Speaker 1: I didn't care.

475
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,281
Speaker 1: I don't really care about the followers, you know I don't.

476
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:57,760
Speaker 1: I'm not the kind of person to pay attention to numbers and give a shit.

477
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,663
Speaker 1: I'm just sort of joking.

478
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,610
Speaker 1: but someone else had more followers than me.

479
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,875
Speaker 1: That's not cool.

480
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:03,079
Speaker 0: I should unfollow you.

481
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,166
Speaker 0: We should all unfollow you.

482
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:05,467
Speaker 1: do it.

483
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:06,068
Speaker 1: that'd be hilarious.

484
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:09,438
Speaker 0: guys either follow Scott or unfollow him and let's see what happens.

485
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:10,978
Speaker 1: sure Do whatever you want.

486
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,524
Speaker 0: So seven wonders.

487
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:17,269
Speaker 0: one of the games we picked.

488
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,032
Speaker 0: we played like.

489
00:28:18,353 --> 00:28:20,800
Speaker 0: I don't know a ton of games that we have to review.

490
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,780
Speaker 0: We've just been slowly like piling them up and then playing them more times to make sure.

491
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,850
Speaker 1: Basically seven wonders is the new hot game.

492
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,000
Speaker 1: I heard about it and I heard that it was the new hot game.

493
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:36,060
Speaker 1: I played it a couple times at someone's house And then I played it a few more times at like a zinc icon and then rim bought a copy and played it even more.

494
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,407
Speaker 0: Yep, it was sold out.

495
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:37,990
Speaker 0: I had to pre-order.

496
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:39,760
Speaker 1: obviously, you know already.

497
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:50,398
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know already that if we played it so much and we kept going back to it that there is good a warning I am getting slightly tired of it and I don't think it has staying power.

498
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,628
Speaker 0: I agree No, well, there we go.

499
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:54,240
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's still a great game.

500
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,297
Speaker 0: I highly recommend you own it because straight up this is a game like Zula Rhetto where it's not the best game.

501
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:04,580
Speaker 1: if you're smart You'll have solved it pretty quickly and the winner will come down to luck.

502
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,760
Speaker 0: But it's a game that you can whip out and play relatively quickly that you can teach relatively quickly.

503
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,975
Speaker 0: It's a great game like at a con like you have a bunch of new people.

504
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:17,436
Speaker 0: We should play a game You don't really want to spend 40 minutes teaching them.

505
00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:22,680
Speaker 1: Puerto Rico The game pretty much is almost exactly in the same niche as ticket to ride.

506
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,708
Speaker 1: It takes about the same length of time to play.

507
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:32,260
Speaker 1: It's got that same mechanic of on your turn All you do is one very small thing and you take a lot of small turns.

508
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:38,300
Speaker 1: So the game goes very quickly and in fact, this is even one better than ticket to ride because everyone takes simultaneous turns.

509
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,660
Speaker 1: So there's absolutely no waiting for anyone to take their turn.

510
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,320
Speaker 0: You just keep going and going and going and going and also prevents over any arguments of oh so-and-so always doesn't take his turn.

511
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:47,984
Speaker 0: That's a lie.

512
00:29:48,024 --> 00:29:54,693
Speaker 0: You take just as long because you can see every round Exactly who's holding everyone up because everyone's taking their turn simultaneously.

513
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:55,998
Speaker 0: It's always Scott Johnson.

514
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:56,460
Speaker 0: That's right.

515
00:29:56,843 --> 00:30:12,398
Speaker 1: So the way seven wonders works is you know You have there's a deck of cards and you split it up and you give everyone a hand and on your turn every turn Of the entire game all you do is play a card That's it and you and then you give that the remaining cards to the person to your left or right depending whatever.

516
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:17,400
Speaker 0: and some of The cards are resources and you basically tap the resources magic style every round.

517
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,280
Speaker 0: So you build up this kind of increasing accumulation of resources and there's a whole bunch of different kind.

518
00:30:22,902 --> 00:30:34,424
Speaker 1: So early in the game you build up more resources and having more resources allows you to play other cards which allow you to play Other cards which allow you to play more cards to give you more points and then at the end of the game rose the most points Wins, right?

519
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:39,460
Speaker 1: So it's all about, you know getting a good sequence of cards that play into each other.

520
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:43,660
Speaker 1: You know every time you play a card and you never use that card it never gets you any points.

521
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,936
Speaker 1: You just wasted a turn because you could have used that card to get money instead Which would be worth at least one point.

522
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:55,040
Speaker 0: now It has a lot of particular mechanics that are either cribbed from other games or just analogously grown.

523
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:56,491
Speaker 0: Like you build buildings, right?

524
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:57,800
Speaker 0: And you can only build unique buildings.

525
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:11,240
Speaker 0: So if there's a granary and you build it, you can't build another granary But you can build another building similar to a great Yes Now the thing is many buildings have a notation on them that if you already have X building you can build this for free.

526
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:19,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically identical to the way it works in Attica For example, I learned by, you know, if you actually look at the cards of the game, right?

527
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,140
Speaker 1: I learned that there's a very, the most difficult card to build in the whole game is worth like eight points.

528
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,844
Speaker 1: I forget what it is.

529
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:26,755
Speaker 1: It might be the Parthenon or something.

530
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:27,520
Speaker 1: It's something ridiculous.

531
00:31:28,027 --> 00:31:28,939
Speaker 1: It's worth a ton of points.

532
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,100
Speaker 1: But if you have a theater you can build that ridiculously expensive building for free.

533
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:40,779
Speaker 1: So basically I always build the theater so that I can always try to get the expensive building for free and it's worked out In my favor two or three times already.

534
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:47,138
Speaker 1: Yep So it's like no way, once you know the cards the game starts to lose a lot of its luster because it's like just sort of obvious.

535
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:47,840
Speaker 1: the path to take?

536
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,224
Speaker 0: Well, I would say the path.

537
00:31:50,264 --> 00:31:56,220
Speaker 0: There are, I don't know, about three, maybe four paths to victory.

538
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's the military path.

539
00:31:58,111 --> 00:31:59,140
Speaker 1: Yeah There's the green path.

540
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,980
Speaker 0: Well, military is a choice that modifies every path.

541
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:04,337
Speaker 0: It does true Because military alone does not win you.

542
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:08,100
Speaker 0: the game That can get you at most 10 plus six plus two points.

543
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:11,196
Speaker 1: It's mostly the green path and the blue path are the ways to go, right?

544
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,520
Speaker 1: And green is harder to do but has a potentially higher payout.

545
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:20,300
Speaker 1: Like if one guy goes all blue and one guy goes all green, green guy is probably gonna win because the way the math works.

546
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,520
Speaker 0: But here let's talk about like the reason the paths are different.

547
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:26,060
Speaker 0: You know not to get into the stupid details of the game because you should just buy it.

548
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,439
Speaker 0: You'll read the rules you see how it really works.

549
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,820
Speaker 0: But the green path is these there's sets of different types of items.

550
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:32,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, science cards.

551
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:44,800
Speaker 0: So there's three types and you get points increasingly based on the number of sets of three that you get But also two to the end points and being the number of one particular one that you have.

552
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,431
Speaker 1: So basically all the green cards.

553
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:51,020
Speaker 1: if you start piling them up It makes sort of like a two-dimensional grid of scoring.

554
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,140
Speaker 1: So all the green cards actually score twice in two different ways.

555
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:55,678
Speaker 1: What this means.

556
00:32:55,901 --> 00:33:03,980
Speaker 1: And one of those ways it scores, it scores exponentially And the other way it scores, it scores linearly, but even the linear scoring is a multiple of seven.

557
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:06,834
Speaker 1: So you get basically every green card.

558
00:33:06,975 --> 00:33:14,120
Speaker 1: as you get more of them The amount of points that each individual green card gives you continues to go up at a very very high rate.

559
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:20,160
Speaker 0: So if you're playing this game because the two-dimensional grid It's actually fairly complicated until you figure it out.

560
00:33:20,262 --> 00:33:25,098
Speaker 0: And then it's obvious If you play this game with friends who have not played it before Get all the green cards.

561
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:31,280
Speaker 0: They will look at the green cards, their eyes will glaze over when you explain how the scoring works And they'll ignore them.

562
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,600
Speaker 0: You will win almost every time if you go for the green cards when people around you are not that bright or haven't played much.

563
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:41,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is sort of interesting because there isn't a lot of inter-player.

564
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:43,140
Speaker 1: You know there is a little bit, right?

565
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,420
Speaker 1: You can buy things from the people to your left or right And you military with the people to your left or right and things like that.

566
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:51,600
Speaker 0: But it has a heavy left-right mechanic.

567
00:33:51,807 --> 00:34:01,220
Speaker 1: Yes And you know you think about your hand, you're going to play a card But any cards you leave in your hand you're giving to the person to your left or your right depending on the age.

568
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:09,920
Speaker 1: So there is significant impact you can have on your immediate neighbors in the game And in a three-player game that's really significant because you're influencing all the other players.

569
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:13,577
Speaker 1: But other than that there isn't a whole lot of inter-player mechanics.

570
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:17,120
Speaker 1: You can't destroy other people's cards, you can't steal their cards.

571
00:34:18,061 --> 00:34:21,260
Speaker 1: There's really not much you can do to take points away from other people.

572
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:26,540
Speaker 0: It's a little more than say Agricola in terms of how much you can actually fuck with everybody.

573
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,600
Speaker 1: I'd say it's a little bit less than Puerto Rico because you can screw with people sort of the same way that you do in Puerto Rico.

574
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:33,679
Speaker 1: Like aha, I played captain so you couldn't play captain.

575
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:38,716
Speaker 1: But it's like a little bit less than that because in Puerto Rico if I craftsman out from under you.

576
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:39,739
Speaker 1: that could hurt you pretty badly.

577
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:50,020
Speaker 0: So my main problem with the game is that like I said I think I have solved it mostly And I think when I play it really just comes down to luck.

578
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:54,120
Speaker 0: And it took maybe eight plays to solve.

579
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,079
Speaker 0: There's not that much going on in the game.

580
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:58,480
Speaker 1: Most people though don't play a game as much as we do right.

581
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,400
Speaker 1: They get a game and if they play it twice it's like oh they're so happy.

582
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:04,120
Speaker 1: You know how many people play it get a game and play it eight times.

583
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,920
Speaker 0: But I found that games like this in a couple weeks will be played a lot.

584
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,800
Speaker 0: Or Zularetto gets played a lot too just because like I said at the beginning they're quick to play.

585
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:12,524
Speaker 1: That is true.

586
00:35:12,564 --> 00:35:15,740
Speaker 1: it is quick to play so if you do bust it out you're probably going to play it two or three times.

587
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,360
Speaker 0: I mean this takes a half hour tops if people are slow.

588
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:22,779
Speaker 0: If people take their turn you'll whip out a whole game including scoring at the end in like 20 minutes.

589
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:30,200
Speaker 1: The scoring could actually take as long as a whole age Just because you know you have to add up so many different things and you know some of them are slightly.

590
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:36,080
Speaker 0: Now the analogy of the game is not as bad as Le Havre which basically doesn't have an actual theme.

591
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,357
Speaker 0: You're just kind of like yeah boats and food get food.

592
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:41,288
Speaker 1: It's a port town.

593
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:47,710
Speaker 0: yeah you make money But seven wonders you're playing a wonder.

594
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,320
Speaker 0: slash the civilization that built that wonder.

595
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,671
Speaker 1: Yeah it's like if you're playing you know the colossus well.

596
00:35:53,711 --> 00:35:54,375
Speaker 1: are you playing?

597
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:57,640
Speaker 1: are you the colossus Or are you the people building the colossus?

598
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,480
Speaker 0: I think you're playing the city state that has wrought the colossus.

599
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,627
Speaker 0: But you know everyone plays a wonder.

600
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:03,828
Speaker 0: so

601
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:04,731
Speaker 1: Sardia you can either

602
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:17,365
Speaker 0: pick them or pass them out randomly And everyone has a little card and in addition to the cards in their hands that they're buying And passing back and forth you can also buy the improvements that make your wonder bigger Like as you complete your wonder.

603
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:22,887
Speaker 0: it does stuff and every wonder has a different set of powers And an a and a b side.

604
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:23,128
Speaker 1: yeah.

605
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:27,564
Speaker 1: so basically everyone has a wonder which is basically three unique cards That no one else has.

606
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:28,529
Speaker 1: effectively right.

607
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:34,634
Speaker 1: it's like everyone's playing with the same deck of cards But each person has three cards usually three sometimes four.

608
00:36:34,654 --> 00:36:36,461
Speaker 1: I think there's one weird one weird Wonder.

609
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:42,184
Speaker 1: that is four but everyone basically has a handful of a few cards that are different from Everyone else's cards.

610
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:45,378
Speaker 1: that makes you unique which gives you a little bit more replay value.

611
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:48,817
Speaker 1: it's like Well I'll play with the mausoleum well now I'll play with the hanging garden.

612
00:36:48,837 --> 00:37:02,340
Speaker 1: so it's a little Slightly different game if you have a different wonder and every wonder has two sides which gives You a little bit more replay value because there's an a side which is easy and direct And there's a b side which is a little more complicated but potentially higher payout.

613
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:08,362
Speaker 0: I would recommend when you play do the random allocation of the wonders but let players pick A or b.

614
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,492
Speaker 1: I would recommend you do it completely randomly.

615
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:12,904
Speaker 0: nah that gets boring because I'm already Bored with the game.

616
00:37:12,924 --> 00:37:18,414
Speaker 0: I mean I wouldn't play it unless I was teaching it or playing it with new People or as like a warm-up game and a board game night.

617
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:18,736
Speaker 0: I wouldn't.

618
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:21,127
Speaker 1: just definitely it's definitely Good warm-up game I don't know.

619
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:23,317
Speaker 1: I wouldn't make the highlight game though no but is.

620
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:29,484
Speaker 1: it is an Excellent new warm-up game you know and if I was short on warm-up games I would definitely add it My game library.

621
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:33,023
Speaker 0: even if I was bored I'm accumulating a lot of warm-up games because I Lacked them.

622
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:37,243
Speaker 1: I realized that because people refuse to play the series games people just play warm-up Games and then they're done.

623
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:47,960
Speaker 0: well I particular I only owned some of the big heavy-hitter games Like el grande and t and e and I own a lot of the weird old out of print games like la cheetah.

624
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:51,691
Speaker 0: I didn't own many quick whip them out games.

625
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:55,044
Speaker 0: that's why I got zularetto and seven wonders and I'm Ordering rico.

626
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,556
Speaker 1: zularetto takes a little bit longer than seven wonders.

627
00:37:57,596 --> 00:38:01,876
Speaker 1: I think it's more of a. It's sort of in between warm-up when I say highlight there's different.

628
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:03,825
Speaker 0: there's two kinds of Warm-up games in my mind.

629
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,576
Speaker 0: there's the warm-up game that's quick to play as in.

630
00:38:06,636 --> 00:38:09,429
Speaker 0: you whip it out you Play with everybody and then you play the main event.

631
00:38:09,992 --> 00:38:18,834
Speaker 0: and then there's the warm-up game like Zularetto where you've got a bunch of people over you're gonna play a game you're gonna play games Many games but people are still wanting to socialize.

632
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:19,557
Speaker 0: they're not in the.

633
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:20,641
Speaker 0: let's just play a Game mode.

634
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:24,817
Speaker 0: yet zularetto you can socialize over without impacting the game.

635
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:27,972
Speaker 1: I mostly think of Zularetto as more like a settlers replacement.

636
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:36,044
Speaker 1: right because like I'm looking down on settlers But zularetto I can still play a lot more easily than I can play guitar settlers in zularetto are Actually pretty equal to me.

637
00:38:36,124 --> 00:38:38,191
Speaker 1: zularetto is a much better gateway.

638
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:38,772
Speaker 1: I think too.

639
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:40,518
Speaker 0: uh I don't know.

640
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:42,183
Speaker 0: it Depends on the person.

641
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:46,921
Speaker 0: someone who is predisposed toward hardcore settlers is a better like intro Game.

642
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:49,912
Speaker 0: someone who isn't zularetto is a better intro game anyway.

643
00:38:50,313 --> 00:38:51,557
Speaker 1: but yeah seven wonders.

644
00:38:51,577 --> 00:38:53,223
Speaker 0: my other new Trouble.

645
00:38:53,283 --> 00:39:01,088
Speaker 0: I'll warn you now when you're teaching this game people who played magic as they were Kids they'll get the resources immediately.

646
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,714
Speaker 0: no one else will.

647
00:39:02,955 --> 00:39:07,346
Speaker 0: yeah I was very surprised Has fucked up the resources.

648
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:13,625
Speaker 0: despite multiple alternative explanations analogies examples Nothing works.

649
00:39:13,745 --> 00:39:17,359
Speaker 1: I can't understand why these people don't understand how the resources work.

650
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,685
Speaker 1: it's like You have two rocks.

651
00:39:18,745 --> 00:39:20,573
Speaker 1: that means you look at the cost of something.

652
00:39:20,614 --> 00:39:21,940
Speaker 1: if it costs three rock you can't.

653
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:27,122
Speaker 1: It's like money that you can only spend it once per turn and every turn everyone gives you all the Money back.

654
00:39:27,222 --> 00:39:28,166
Speaker 0: it's magic resources.

655
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:36,658
Speaker 0: you tap them every round but people don't get that and they'll like They'll buy resources by trying to like play cards and just they will cock that up.

656
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:37,701
Speaker 0: you've got to make Sure.

657
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:41,915
Speaker 0: after you teach the whole game teach everybody resources again.

658
00:39:42,035 --> 00:39:45,206
Speaker 0: I guarantee at least one of your Players doesn't actually understand.

659
00:39:45,226 --> 00:39:55,040
Speaker 1: yeah and on top of that right even if people uh understand Resources right there's a lot of the game requires you to notice a lot of small things on the cards.

660
00:39:55,421 --> 00:40:00,097
Speaker 1: For example you know the you what this card upgrades to that card for free.

661
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:02,406
Speaker 1: well it's a really Tiny icon that says that.

662
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:08,747
Speaker 1: so if you're not really looking closely at every card you might like say Not build something even though you could have for free.

663
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,451
Speaker 1: uh you know.

664
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:14,162
Speaker 0: because uh yep people will also Fuck up.

665
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:18,517
Speaker 0: they will not remember that they can't build the same named building twice.

666
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:22,778
Speaker 0: so they'll Build the barracks and then they'll build the barracks again and it just cocks up the game.

667
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:27,228
Speaker 0: Anyway other than that the game is great.

668
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:32,611
Speaker 0: uh i don't know if it was really worth msrp but I'm glad i own it.

669
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:36,523
Speaker 1: mm-hmm We're doing more show or is that enough?
