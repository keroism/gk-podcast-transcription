1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,049
Speaker 0: It's Monday July 2nd 2012.

2
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:12,550
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,440
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight hardware lockdown and all that bullshit.

4
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,353
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:28,406
Speaker 0: We often say this at the start of the show, but warm today.

6
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:32,069
Speaker 0: It is warm, but actually even warmer yesterday.

7
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:38,817
Speaker 1: Ah It's not yet been so warm that I did not want it to be Warmer not at all.

8
00:00:38,857 --> 00:00:49,840
Speaker 0: However, there was a Guy today in fact a 10-minute span yesterday when we were biking up the hill in the Sun with no breeze Back from New Jersey where I would have liked it to be cooler.

9
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,232
Speaker 0: in a zone around my body for about 10 minutes There's.

10
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:58,025
Speaker 1: I was getting a fruit juice at the juice truck today juice cart.

11
00:00:58,487 --> 00:00:59,370
Speaker 0: and what kind of fruit juice?

12
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:01,703
Speaker 1: I think it was pineapple orange banana mango.

13
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:07,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, and There's a guy in front of me and a tourist walks up and says right where's Rockefeller Center?

14
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:09,591
Speaker 1: and I'm like right behind that fucking building.

15
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:18,522
Speaker 1: and the guy in front of me is like, ah, thanks cuz I didn't I didn't remember where it was and I was like Okay, and he's like it's pretty warm today.

16
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:23,390
Speaker 1: and I'm like, yeah, it's pretty warm But I'd rather have be warmer like maybe 120.

17
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,502
Speaker 0: I've had that weird that same kind of conversation with a lot of strangers lately.

18
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:28,952
Speaker 0: if someone complains about the heat or says something about The heat.

19
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:31,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, and my response is always I'd like it to be about 10 degrees hotter.

20
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,285
Speaker 1: I'm like, I wanted to be about 120 right and the guys like what was the last time you were in 120?

21
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:38,673
Speaker 1: and I'm like The shower.

22
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:41,684
Speaker 1: Nah, and he's like, uh, he's like I've been in 120.

23
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:47,487
Speaker 1: It was rough But I was carrying a whole bunch of gear and he was.

24
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:50,645
Speaker 1: uh I assume he was probably like an India Sun because he was an Indian guy.

25
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:56,894
Speaker 1: So Racist, I'm just saying because India is a warm place It's near the equator.

26
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,202
Speaker 0: I would not terribly enjoy once.

27
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:01,790
Speaker 1: I assume that that's the place that he was when it was 120.

28
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,099
Speaker 0: I actually prefer about 95.

29
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,946
Speaker 0: That's my like go-to zone for heat.

30
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:15,510
Speaker 0: I'll take 500,000 anyway, so as you all know as I tweeted there was you know, we got an extra second over the weekend.

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,195
Speaker 0: We had a leap second now.

32
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,205
Speaker 0: I don't really want to debate the long weekend guys.

33
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:23,702
Speaker 0: Yeah deep question, man Why could we get that leap second during packs?

34
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:24,829
Speaker 1: I know right.

35
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:32,386
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, you know The whether or not we need to do that is up for debate because we live on earth.

36
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:33,410
Speaker 0: we don't live anywhere else.

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,554
Speaker 0: So keep your time.

38
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:46,008
Speaker 0: It's because in sync with earth in the fact that the earth is slowing down Make sense that we have to update our calendar, but at the same time Leap seconds cause Linux to shit itself.

39
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,230
Speaker 0: There are there are numerous kernel bugs in Linux and there's all sorts of different issues.

40
00:02:51,250 --> 00:03:04,907
Speaker 0: But basically if any of you out there have a Linux server, I would highly recommend at some point From today onward reboot it because Some crap happens and you might think oh, this is just tech people being alarmist.

41
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:26,080
Speaker 0: I Personally witnessed such crazy things as threads being spawned But then the kernel thought that they returned from like nano sleep before they started because the kernel was off by exactly a second from the system time in another place because it didn't handle the leap second right and Crazy bullshit happened and I'm.

42
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:34,680
Speaker 0: I will link to you two Examples of this because this is a real problem I actually had to deal with as a computer.

43
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,450
Speaker 1: the problem was very much tied to Java.

44
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,917
Speaker 1: I noticed a lot of the fixes.

45
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:45,468
Speaker 1: Ah, there were two separate sets of problems Related and I know you do Java stuff because I had no problems with my lampsticks.

46
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:52,908
Speaker 0: Yep No, Java itself would have problems with this but independently there were some generic system things that could also go.

47
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:56,420
Speaker 1: wonder if Java had The problem on Windows or Mac or something.

48
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,989
Speaker 0: I don't know because Windows servers get rebooted all the time.

49
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:10,950
Speaker 1: So Yeah, I mean my my opinion on leap second right is if you want to keep the calendar in sync with the earth Which I think we need to for now.

50
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:18,269
Speaker 1: The reason that you keep the calendar in sync with the earth is so that the seasons line up right with things.

51
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:24,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know you can say for example aha It'll always be cold in December right and you know around the Christmas time.

52
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,008
Speaker 1: Otherwise if we don't do that, eventually we're gonna have Christmas summer sit.

53
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:31,190
Speaker 0: you know That happened at several points in our history.

54
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,956
Speaker 1: You're gonna have San Diego.

55
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:34,642
Speaker 1: comic-con is every year in July.

56
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:35,685
Speaker 1: Oh, why is it snowing?

57
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:36,026
Speaker 1: Fuck?

58
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:37,990
Speaker 1: That's why I guess It doesn't snow in San Diego.

59
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,664
Speaker 0: That's why we kept.

60
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:45,786
Speaker 0: you know First we had to leap years and then the rules were every four years, but not every hundred years But yes every 400, right?

61
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,546
Speaker 1: So that's why we have.

62
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:53,660
Speaker 1: you know If we're gonna keep the calendar we have and keep it in sync with the seasons you got to leap it but the only air.

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,534
Speaker 1: so the alternative is either keep doing what we're doing or Metric kind of calendar.

64
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:00,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what.

65
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,241
Speaker 0: there was a metric calendar, you know what it.

66
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,926
Speaker 0: you know, how many people used it?

67
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:05,049
Speaker 0: one zero.

68
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:08,518
Speaker 0: It was in France Napoleon era.

69
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:09,784
Speaker 0: it was all tens.

70
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,150
Speaker 0: It was kind of stupid didn't really work.

71
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:16,346
Speaker 1: Did you see those trucks that were delivering some sort of alcohol and had a giant Napoleon on the side?

72
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:19,008
Speaker 1: No We piked right past him.

73
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:20,555
Speaker 0: I guess I wasn't making tension.

74
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,120
Speaker 1: but there's some brand of alcohol and the.

75
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,644
Speaker 1: the label is Napoleon.

76
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:27,678
Speaker 1: and I wonder like is that the The alcohol that Napoleon liked to drink?

77
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,083
Speaker 1: is it made by him?

78
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:30,248
Speaker 1: Is it made by you know?

79
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,919
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it is it made in the place that he's from.

80
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,922
Speaker 1: what's the deal with it?

81
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,946
Speaker 0: Where is Napoleon?

82
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,190
Speaker 0: from France?

83
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,008
Speaker 0: Corsica anyway.

84
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:43,950
Speaker 0: But you know biking is neither here nor there nor our kernel panic.

85
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:46,639
Speaker 0: So this is when I was didn't really a kernel panic.

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,947
Speaker 0: if it was just panicked that would have been fine.

87
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:51,342
Speaker 0: if Linux had just Crashed would have been cool.

88
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:57,922
Speaker 0: But the fact that in Determinate state where threads didn't behave right my god.

89
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:00,490
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'm going to Corsica.

90
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,039
Speaker 0: I'll see you later to talk about some more, you know to have a news bit I had a personal experience recently see.

91
00:06:06,823 --> 00:06:08,210
Speaker 0: almost exactly a week ago.

92
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:16,550
Speaker 0: I opened a door and I had my cell phone in my pocket and I bumped it against the door in my pocket Normal bump the kind of thing that happens all the time.

93
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,370
Speaker 0: But later I get to work and I pull my phone out.

94
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,989
Speaker 0: You know my instinct to look at it for something and I noticed the screen has shattered.

95
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:26,720
Speaker 0: So I had to go.

96
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:27,447
Speaker 0: I didn't you know.

97
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:33,086
Speaker 0: I couldn't just get it replaced at the Sprint store because that's not covered by the normal warranty.

98
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,388
Speaker 0: nor is my phone You know new.

99
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:42,970
Speaker 0: And I didn't want to sign another two-year contract with Sprint because Google Glass and the new iPhone are on the horizon.

100
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:51,058
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna sign up a two-year contract for the privilege of paying $200 instead of $700 for the next Samsung phone.

101
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,669
Speaker 0: that isn't as good as the phone I've got.

102
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,329
Speaker 0: So I look at my options.

103
00:06:56,372 --> 00:07:02,821
Speaker 0: basically, I found for like a hundred bucks a refurbished Identical version of my phone from some guy was used.

104
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,190
Speaker 0: he like refurbished it and sold it on Amazon.

105
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,097
Speaker 0: So I bought it and I activated it.

106
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:07,579
Speaker 0: and you know what.

107
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:15,693
Speaker 0: right now ice cream sandwich is reinstalling looks fine alright, but I had to go a week without a cell phone and It was rough.

108
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's interesting.

109
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,404
Speaker 0: It wasn't rough in the ways.

110
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:27,230
Speaker 0: I expected I did not feel Withdrawal the way so many articles said I would because the phone is like an extension.

111
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,480
Speaker 1: Just rough in that anytime you want to look at it.

112
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:29,701
Speaker 1: You go.

113
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:30,485
Speaker 1: Ah, it's not there.

114
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:31,530
Speaker 1: Ah, it's not there.

115
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:45,605
Speaker 0: I felt like I was missing a sense Like I felt like one of my senses was gone the sense of access external memory and know exactly where I am Geophysically at all times because the day my phone broke I had to bike home.

116
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,330
Speaker 0: All right, I'll bike home.

117
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:48,430
Speaker 0: I start biking.

118
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:57,780
Speaker 0: I get just far enough away from work to where we take too long to walk back before the building was closed and Nowhere near a subway station and my rear tire exploded.

119
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,468
Speaker 0: I don't carry a patch kit on me or anything.

120
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:01,692
Speaker 0: So I'm like fuck All right.

121
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:04,645
Speaker 0: Well, I'll just look up where a bike shop.

122
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:07,036
Speaker 0: fuck fuck Start walking.

123
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:08,804
Speaker 0: I ask everyone I pass.

124
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:10,170
Speaker 0: Hey, is there a bike shop around here?

125
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,217
Speaker 1: You know, there's one on both sides of the bridge.

126
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:14,464
Speaker 0: So yeah, which bridge?

127
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:15,990
Speaker 1: the one that you used to get home?

128
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I couldn't find one.

129
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,150
Speaker 0: So I found one bike shop at the base of the Williamsburg bridge.

130
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:24,368
Speaker 0: They did not have tires in the size of my bike.

131
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,936
Speaker 1: Why didn't you just get a tube?

132
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:26,740
Speaker 1: you need a tire for?

133
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,482
Speaker 0: because the tire was shot a nay This gigantic like wood screw went through it sideways.

134
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:33,085
Speaker 0: I don't even know how.

135
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:34,409
Speaker 0: so there was a chunk out of it.

136
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,361
Speaker 0: There was no way safe way to ride on that tire.

137
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:37,710
Speaker 0: tire was fucked.

138
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:42,697
Speaker 0: so that bike shop couldn't help me and No one could tell me where another bike shop was.

139
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:52,075
Speaker 0: So I just kept walking north until I hit 14th Street Because I knew there was a bike shop there that I knew could help me and I got my bike fixed And then I biked home.

140
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:53,241
Speaker 1: I know a bike shop less.

141
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:55,010
Speaker 1: That's more south than 14th Street.

142
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,298
Speaker 1: You go to bike habitat, which is on Lafayette.

143
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would have to find that with no phone and apparently I know exactly.

144
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:01,346
Speaker 0: Now.

145
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:13,188
Speaker 0: yeah I now I know why people ask for directions all the time in New York because I learned that if you ask someone in New York for directions the majority of them unless you're asking for subway directions have no fucking idea.

146
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,316
Speaker 0: Yep They don't know where anything is.

147
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:18,530
Speaker 0: you ask someone like hey, where's you know, the Empire Staple?

148
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:26,390
Speaker 1: I told you today the guy in front of me was a New Yorker and someone asked him Where's Rockefeller Center and I knew where it was and we were like one block away from it.

149
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,610
Speaker 0: He's like no, but if that person had asked hey, how do I get to the F train?

150
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,414
Speaker 0: They'd be like one block.

151
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:33,428
Speaker 1: that way maybe the F train was actually right underneath.

152
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:33,709
Speaker 1: worst.

153
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:44,463
Speaker 0: But the fact that bike like the other day at Saturday had to bike to the beach again not having my instant Always on always perfect GPS on me huge problem.

154
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,830
Speaker 1: I actually made it to the beach of the map made of paper.

155
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:50,705
Speaker 0: I don't carry maps made of paper because my phone is so much faster than that.

156
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:52,090
Speaker 1: It's not much faster than paper.

157
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:59,321
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, I think the problem is you're on an iPhone Loads no matter what Scott my phone loads no matter what.

158
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:03,217
Speaker 0: the whole of New York is cashed and the GPS is Independent of my data plan.

159
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:05,669
Speaker 0: So even if I'm an airplane mode, I turn it on.

160
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:07,769
Speaker 0: It shows me exactly where I am on the map.

161
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:13,220
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, like within five seconds of turning my screen on five seconds I could do the map whole map in less than five seconds.

162
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,621
Speaker 1: Really?

163
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:13,943
Speaker 0: Really?

164
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:15,108
Speaker 0: All right, pull your map out.

165
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:18,433
Speaker 0: go Three four.

166
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:21,304
Speaker 1: if I had the map I would have been out and back in our.

167
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:25,621
Speaker 0: I highly doubt that Having having that phone on me all the time.

168
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:27,569
Speaker 1: This is what this is what it's like if I have the map ready.

169
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,894
Speaker 1: ready Huh?

170
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:34,010
Speaker 1: It took two seconds, I actually doubt that the map is out.

171
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,950
Speaker 1: It's folded to the spot where you are is already facing out.

172
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,097
Speaker 1: But how do you know where you are?

173
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:38,499
Speaker 1: take it?

174
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,270
Speaker 1: Cuz you look at the street sign or some shit.

175
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,960
Speaker 0: All right, so you've already had to look at the street sign.

176
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:42,985
Speaker 1: How do you know where you are?

177
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:43,770
Speaker 1: and in Metro?

178
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,980
Speaker 1: It's like Metroid right you push start to bring the map up.

179
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,170
Speaker 1: Oh and you push start again in the maps gone.

180
00:10:48,452 --> 00:10:49,438
Speaker 1: How do I know where?

181
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,646
Speaker 1: I know I'm in fucking Norfair?

182
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,494
Speaker 0: All right You gotta find it.

183
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:52,995
Speaker 0: what if your bike?

184
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:56,205
Speaker 1: I know the elevator was three screens to the left.

185
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:57,168
Speaker 1: cuz I've gone.

186
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:57,830
Speaker 1: three screens.

187
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,434
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

188
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,410
Speaker 1: So you know what the map out of Norfair I go.

189
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:02,054
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah You already have to pull the map out.

190
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,986
Speaker 0: my phone already shows me exactly where I am and my cargo direction.

191
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:05,890
Speaker 1: pulling the phone out.

192
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,850
Speaker 1: It's just as long as you're kidding pulling my phone You got to unlock the phone and then you got to push the map icon.

193
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:18,804
Speaker 0: Actually, the maps already open because I put my phone in navigation mode with the Google my places thing Not my places Google on my tracks.

194
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:22,968
Speaker 0: Uh-huh So whenever I'm going anywhere, my phone is always in like super GPS mode.

195
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:25,100
Speaker 0: Mmm, you should try that.

196
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,145
Speaker 0: Oh wait, you have an iPhone.

197
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:27,050
Speaker 0: That's not that stuff works.

198
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:28,437
Speaker 0: I just see your maps are kind of shitty.

199
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:30,709
Speaker 1: My map is paper map is the best.

200
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,121
Speaker 0: Yeah Because you have an iPhone with shitty Google Maps.

201
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:38,243
Speaker 0: if you had a Google map that worked all the time Really catching a lot.

202
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:42,969
Speaker 1: I I'm not saying I'm not gonna have a phone I'm saying the paper map is faster.

203
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:48,169
Speaker 0: But the thing that I missed the most was literally primarily if the paper map was in fear.

204
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,380
Speaker 1: here I use the best technology for any job.

205
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:55,230
Speaker 0: Yes, and I think the best technology for that is Made of paper the Android phone.

206
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:58,401
Speaker 1: So anyway, and your battery dies.

207
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:01,095
Speaker 1: and now I look at my paper map My battery is fine.

208
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,140
Speaker 0: actually doing biking.

209
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,110
Speaker 0: a whole day of biking with GPS is fine.

210
00:12:04,855 --> 00:12:05,420
Speaker 1: Anyway, you done.

211
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,799
Speaker 0: Uh, no But it was in I'm thinking about.

212
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:29,450
Speaker 0: I'm trying to like put down all the like problems I ran into in my life not having this phone and I guess I'd always kind of posited like how heavily I rely on having an always-on always available data plan with GPS and all these things and Not having it for a week Validated that to a ludicrous degree.

213
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:33,210
Speaker 0: Like maybe I might have thought oh, maybe I can get away just fine with my foot without my phone.

214
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,236
Speaker 0: No, I can't.

215
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:42,391
Speaker 0: that phone is so pivotal to my life That I would have to change my entire way of doing things if I were not to have a phone for an extended period of Time.

216
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,630
Speaker 1: and this is the person when you didn't have a smartphone.

217
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,486
Speaker 1: You're even against getting a phone with a camera on it.

218
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:56,250
Speaker 1: and I was like Just like when you were using Internet Explorer and I was like you should really use fire When I was against cameras on phones.

219
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,996
Speaker 0: That was when I worked in a place where if you had a camera on your phone You weren't allowed to bring it in the building.

220
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:02,727
Speaker 1: Listen many times throughout history.

221
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,436
Speaker 1: I've been the one Example so one.

222
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,030
Speaker 0: I wasn't allowed to bring a phone.

223
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,297
Speaker 1: No, you were also in my office.

224
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:13,067
Speaker 1: You got one while you were working at that place.

225
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,070
Speaker 1: In fact, right?

226
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,363
Speaker 1: So apparently it wasn't too much of an issue and you did not end.

227
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:19,210
Speaker 1: that was your at the time.

228
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,801
Speaker 1: You said I quote you do.

229
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:23,690
Speaker 1: that was not your excuse for not needing one.

230
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,710
Speaker 1: Your excuse was who needs a camera on a phone?

231
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,203
Speaker 0: So Scott stupid my first cell phone didn't have a camera.

232
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,850
Speaker 0: because of that they didn't exist.

233
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, they did.

234
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, I got another phone later.

235
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,648
Speaker 0: I worked in a different building.

236
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:44,769
Speaker 0: at that point I could have a camera but the cat the pictures the camera took were so shitty.

237
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:48,496
Speaker 1: and Yeah, you use that camera Relatively often.

238
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:48,878
Speaker 0: actually.

239
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:51,209
Speaker 0: that what I didn't cuz I had no way to get the pictures off of that phone.

240
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,036
Speaker 1: I remember you getting the pictures off.

241
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:55,865
Speaker 0: No, no, you're thinking of my pre.

242
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,170
Speaker 1: No the blue phone.

243
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:58,596
Speaker 0: I couldn't get pictures off of that.

244
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:00,263
Speaker 1: I remember you getting pictures.

245
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:01,910
Speaker 0: I had no way to get pictures off of that.

246
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:02,859
Speaker 0: I had a fee.

247
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:10,732
Speaker 0: I took pictures of things I Lost.

248
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:14,221
Speaker 0: my next phone was the palm pre and you know what.

249
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:18,637
Speaker 0: the camera was high enough megapixel and I could just dump them to My computer.

250
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:20,350
Speaker 0: that suddenly the camera was awesome.

251
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:28,579
Speaker 0: the only reason the camera wasn't awesome on the older phones is because the phone the pictures on those cameras sucked and it was hard to Get the pictures off on those old ass phones.

252
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,768
Speaker 1: Just want to say who needs tab browsing?

253
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:30,849
Speaker 1: who?

254
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:35,782
Speaker 1: Who needs a phone with a camera in it?

255
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:36,686
Speaker 1: who need right?

256
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:37,349
Speaker 1: this is rim.

257
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,970
Speaker 0: Like smartphones, I wanted a smartphone from day one, but I couldn't afford one.

258
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, uncle moneybags vice president couldn't afford to smart.

259
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:51,484
Speaker 0: Yes, because I was a vice president in like 2006 a lot of people we know who are way poor.

260
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,630
Speaker 1: they got plenty of smartphones.

261
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,525
Speaker 0: Okay, you realize data plans were a lot more expensive.

262
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:59,862
Speaker 1: They're still the same 2004-2005 more expensive now because they're giving you less.

263
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,668
Speaker 0: and also back then a lot of phones.

264
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:03,557
Speaker 0: the GPS Sucked and was useless.

265
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:05,285
Speaker 0: the maps sucked and were useless.

266
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,230
Speaker 0: things were very different back.

267
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:27,056
Speaker 0: Then it wasn't worth the money for the pity piddly benefit I get because I realized from this experience that the primary things I use my phone for are basically Looking at videos and or kind of high bandwidth data getting emails in a push format using Twitter and High precision GPS stuff.

268
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:31,070
Speaker 0: Those are literally the primary things that I needed and everything else really didn't matter.

269
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,999
Speaker 1: Anyway, let's move on.

270
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,683
Speaker 0: Okay.

271
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:35,386
Speaker 1: Let it rim.

272
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:36,010
Speaker 1: So check this out.

273
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:42,450
Speaker 1: So Google+ a lot of people they'd be down on Google+ all over the Internet's and you know what?

274
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:49,074
Speaker 1: I think you know, it's I'm always the person who's just like whatever, you know, everyone's always like, oh this service is good That one's bad.

275
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:52,550
Speaker 1: It's like who get or that, you know, one changes the because it's a good change.

276
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,356
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a bad change.

277
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:55,050
Speaker 1: Mostly people say it's a bad only problem with you.

278
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,355
Speaker 1: It is bad change.

279
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,162
Speaker 0: hardly anyone uses it and there's no API.

280
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:00,030
Speaker 0: So I never actually look at anything.

281
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:02,738
Speaker 0: But I never look at anything.

282
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:05,269
Speaker 0: anyone posts, but I post stuff anyway.

283
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:12,310
Speaker 1: So, you know people are always, you know up and down on these different services switching between them choosing different ones.

284
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,964
Speaker 1: I'm just like, yeah, whatever others use fucking everything.

285
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:20,050
Speaker 1: I don't care But Google+ is doing something that is potentially the awesomest.

286
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:34,729
Speaker 1: So they have to hangouts right and hangouts have already sort of replaced Skype ish for the group conference situation with video Because it lets you do extra stuff like share, you know, watch YouTube videos together and stuff like that.

287
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:39,770
Speaker 1: They have an API for Google Hangouts and you might think oh, what is this API do?

288
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,254
Speaker 1: it lets you make apps for Google Hangout, which is genius.

289
00:16:44,294 --> 00:17:05,819
Speaker 1: amazing because now you can basically Start a hangout and you can write an app and then basically your app will occupy all that space that the faces aren't Occupying on the screen and everyone can sort of interact in that space with whatever your app does which happens to be perfect for Every board game in the goddamn known universe

290
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,624
Speaker 0: never mind every role-playing game

291
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:08,406
Speaker 1: right.

292
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:14,053
Speaker 1: in addition You know, it's also The.

293
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:18,510
Speaker 1: the reason people found out about this thing is because someone's making Dominion for they showed it off at Google.

294
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:20,130
Speaker 1: It looks like fucking Dominion.

295
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:25,909
Speaker 1: but really the real magic here that people don't realize is that a very hard thing to do.

296
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:37,355
Speaker 1: a Relatively difficult thing to do is to write a web application that has real-time synchronized Updated shared data between the different people right?

297
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:42,248
Speaker 1: So, you know you think about you know, pretty much any real-time multiplayer thing.

298
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:55,050
Speaker 1: There has to be some sort of shared data data that everyone has in common that Different people can modify and all of those data modifications by the different participants is updated to all the other participants, right?

299
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:01,406
Speaker 1: The Google Hangout API pretty much makes that just work like brain-dead easy.

300
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:06,804
Speaker 1: You pretty much say hey Update the state and then on the other people there's an event that's like on the state.

301
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:12,450
Speaker 1: when the state is changed do this Then change the state and when the state is and the other people have when this data change do that.

302
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,750
Speaker 1: It's just straightforward and really simple.

303
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:18,885
Speaker 1: You don't have to code any of this hard stuff because the Google servers just take care of it.

304
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:21,055
Speaker 0: So Scott, here's the thing Should.

305
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:23,750
Speaker 0: are we going to do anything with this or we should talking?

306
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:27,438
Speaker 1: You know, we could make YouTube the game on it.

307
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:30,347
Speaker 0: We probably should make YouTube the game probably but will we?

308
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:33,443
Speaker 0: that's what I'm asking Since we're on air now, you know, are we going to?

309
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:34,449
Speaker 0: you know, we're kings of shit.

310
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:34,630
Speaker 1: talk.

311
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:41,030
Speaker 0: You want to move up to Emperor Emperor shit the Emperor of shit and talk dude, at least I'll be an emperor.

312
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,826
Speaker 1: Emperor God Emperor.

313
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,601
Speaker 1: The only thing above Emperor.

314
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,690
Speaker 1: all they have left is modifications of Emperor.

315
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:52,910
Speaker 1: You can't really get better than them, you know if we're gonna use that title?

316
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,854
Speaker 0: I actually prefer Imperator because it sounds so much more In the Imperator.

317
00:18:57,894 --> 00:19:00,525
Speaker 1: someone below the Emperor sort of like a chance.

318
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:01,770
Speaker 1: allure is below the chance.

319
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:04,078
Speaker 0: I think they just come from the same route.

320
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,028
Speaker 1: I thought it was like you're the Emperor and the Imperator.

321
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:07,429
Speaker 0: Here we go.

322
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:13,150
Speaker 0: Latin word Imperator was originally a title roughly equivalent to commander under the Roman Republic.

323
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:18,266
Speaker 0: It later became part of the titulature of the Roman emperors as part of their cognomen.

324
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:19,550
Speaker 1: What's cognomen?

325
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:21,700
Speaker 0: All right Let me click on that.

326
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:33,930
Speaker 0: like you don't know Cognomen Latin plural cognomenia together with was the third name of a citizen of ancient Rome Under Roman naming conventions, so I would be Scott Rubin cognomen.

327
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:39,994
Speaker 0: No, you would have a cognomen and the cognitive your nickname like Scott Rubin Dicker.

328
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:46,344
Speaker 1: Oh I get it nom name nom and hog nom.

329
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:51,544
Speaker 1: I know what the cog is for but Nomine is clearly name related.

330
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,633
Speaker 1: All right, anyway We'll see.

331
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:57,630
Speaker 0: Let's see if we move up to Emperor because I got some ideas and you have some ideas.

332
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:03,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know back when in the day I remember the Facebook apps first appeared and I was like what kind of app would you make on Facebook?

333
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,774
Speaker 1: And I really right.

334
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:14,010
Speaker 1: but if you had made a quick move on that you would have been Swinging right if you had made like early Facebook apps, so here's your chance to make early Google+ hangout apps.

335
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:17,042
Speaker 1: Which could you know make Google+?

336
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:18,650
Speaker 1: it's a chicken and egg situation, right?

337
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,821
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, will this succeed or fail?

338
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:24,909
Speaker 1: who knows but making apps for it Is the chicken to the egg to make it succeed?

339
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,680
Speaker 1: If you could make an app and it could still fail.

340
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,408
Speaker 1: but making more apps for it helps.

341
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,356
Speaker 1: it Decreases the chance of the failing.

342
00:20:31,757 --> 00:20:33,303
Speaker 1: so that goes both ways.

343
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,269
Speaker 0: Well, we'll see if we do anything with it.

344
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,414
Speaker 1: Yep, I can at least try out hello world.

345
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:45,770
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

346
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:51,555
Speaker 0: I hope none of you have seen this but if you watch every TED talk Then you've probably run into it at some point.

347
00:20:52,176 --> 00:21:07,426
Speaker 0: This is Marco tempest doing an amazing little sort of performance art biography of Nikola Tesla, okay, it is Pretty amazing to watch just for the way it's presented and I don't want to say anything else.

348
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:08,490
Speaker 0: It's only six minutes long.

349
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:09,581
Speaker 0: Just watch it.

350
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:10,309
Speaker 0: It's great.

351
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:12,029
Speaker 1: I'll take the time of grove over.

352
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:14,788
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

353
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:17,450
Speaker 1: So everyone probably saw this already.

354
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:22,647
Speaker 1: It's a Japanese robot because they seem to make the best robots and it plays rock-paper-scissors.

355
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:26,197
Speaker 1: It's a robot fist But it has a 100% win rate.

356
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:26,839
Speaker 1: Now.

357
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:29,386
Speaker 1: You're probably thinking whoa, how can you have a 100% win rate?

358
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,334
Speaker 1: With rock-paper-scissors.

359
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:36,147
Speaker 1: I mean if I can't write a rock-paper-scissors bot that always win.

360
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:46,610
Speaker 0: now what I would assume I would think maybe it's using like Resonance imaging or like facial stuff to like read the person's mind, which we'll probably have someday.

361
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,670
Speaker 0: But this thing works in such a simpler principle?

362
00:21:50,011 --> 00:22:04,345
Speaker 1: yeah, so what this does actually is as a camera that watches your fist to see what you through and Then the robot is just so fast that it will always Counter-attack and win after it.

363
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,210
Speaker 1: so basically it's cheating.

364
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,566
Speaker 1: It's like if I look and I see what rim does and then he throws scissor.

365
00:22:08,586 --> 00:22:10,577
Speaker 1: I put out a rock He throws out a paper.

366
00:22:10,638 --> 00:22:16,766
Speaker 1: I throw out a scissor only it's so fast You can't realize that I'm cheating cuz I'm like, you know Superman now.

367
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:17,770
Speaker 1: That's what this robot does.

368
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:22,629
Speaker 0: it's questionable as to whether or not it actually is cheating because it's non-detectable.

369
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:24,159
Speaker 0: and No, what?

370
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,910
Speaker 0: most people who play?

371
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:28,050
Speaker 0: Most people who play paper-rock-scissors?

372
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:29,877
Speaker 0: Don't think about it.

373
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:33,490
Speaker 0: in terms of is there a race condition like what is the allowable?

374
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,621
Speaker 0: Interval between the two hands opening before it's considered a foul?

375
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:43,281
Speaker 0: and you try again because it is Impossible to be perfectly synchronized.

376
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,910
Speaker 0: You have to allow for some manner of deviation.

377
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:47,455
Speaker 1: yes, but it's any it?

378
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:57,633
Speaker 1: I think what it is is if two humans are playing if the if the you know if the differ if The time difference is detectable by humans then it's too long Right.

379
00:22:57,713 --> 00:23:01,370
Speaker 0: So you're saying if a human and a robot play then if the time difference is detectable by a robot.

380
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:06,773
Speaker 1: let's discuss the more fundamental question, right is Undetected?

381
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:07,720
Speaker 1: is it cheating?

382
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,234
Speaker 1: Okay, if you are not caught Well, it depends.

383
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:15,270
Speaker 0: You know what cheating is only defined as violating the explicit rules of the game, right?

384
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,409
Speaker 0: So let's say so what are the rules?

385
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,077
Speaker 1: So let's say I play baseball.

386
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:21,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I take steroids which is against the rules.

387
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,099
Speaker 0: Yep, so you're cheating and I'm never.

388
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,797
Speaker 1: and I but I do I'm so good at it They I'm never ever caught or even suspected.

389
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:29,301
Speaker 0: I would argue that you still cheated.

390
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:31,949
Speaker 1: Okay, so therefore the robot you'd.

391
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:32,350
Speaker 0: ah.

392
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,741
Speaker 0: But what is the definition of cheating in tic-tac-toe or paper-rock-scissors?

393
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:39,749
Speaker 0: I don't know why you can't cheat a tic-tac-toe.

394
00:23:40,494 --> 00:23:42,470
Speaker 0: Maybe I can't I erase your oh and put it.

395
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:47,706
Speaker 1: I think there's a situation though, right?

396
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,821
Speaker 0: Where Scott if you and I play paper-rock-scissors if you're a Fraction behind me.

397
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:54,749
Speaker 0: What's the line?

398
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,577
Speaker 1: If you could detect that I'm a fraction.

399
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:02,496
Speaker 0: so if I detect I'll just every time I lose I'll say up you were too late You couldn't actually detect it.

400
00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:03,762
Speaker 0: I would just say I detected it.

401
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,610
Speaker 1: You just say you detected.

402
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:11,617
Speaker 0: How do you lose until you win and I'd foul everything until I won Four thousand.

403
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:16,781
Speaker 0: you're out like baseball Calls the foul the person who's late of the person who's early.

404
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,226
Speaker 1: if you're late you're fouled.

405
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:19,190
Speaker 1: early is always better.

406
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,955
Speaker 0: So I declare that I saw you being late every time We had.

407
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:25,874
Speaker 1: if you're gonna be a jerk then we need Judge.

408
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:27,910
Speaker 1: this is if you're gonna be a jerk on a video reap.

409
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,124
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is that this is why soccer needs goddamn video replay.

410
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:32,646
Speaker 0: That's right.

411
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:33,569
Speaker 0: Fuck the World Cup.

412
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:33,850
Speaker 0: That's right.

413
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:36,174
Speaker 1: All the cups that don't I.

414
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:37,920
Speaker 0: just I can't care about soccer anymore.

415
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,150
Speaker 0: all that all the FIFA's because of the officiating situation.

416
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:42,022
Speaker 0: Pretend everything.

417
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:45,898
Speaker 0: I just said fuck Something anus.

418
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:50,303
Speaker 1: I don't know I was trying to turn FIFA because it had I in it to be.

419
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:52,210
Speaker 1: to use the word instant use fucking an anus?

420
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:53,780
Speaker 1: Well, no to be.

421
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,430
Speaker 1: I was trying to make an acronym out of it.

422
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,985
Speaker 1: That would be get some fucking instant replay assholes because it had F an instant.

423
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:06,187
Speaker 1: So F. Yes I don't know what to do with the F and the The other F in the a few men do.

424
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:13,620
Speaker 0: The book club book is what you're going to do.

425
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:20,351
Speaker 0: show on as soon as we get a chance because we're both done with the Book, but we had to bail out a show cutie in 84

426
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:32,453
Speaker 1: Other meta moments not this weekend, but next weekend, which happens to be July 13 14 15 2012 is Connecticut 2012

427
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:34,141
Speaker 0: in hard to for to connect a kid.

428
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,427
Speaker 1: You should fucking go.

429
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:37,197
Speaker 0: if you're close We run the panels.

430
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:39,090
Speaker 1: don't come too far to go there.

431
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,957
Speaker 1: But if you're close better be there.

432
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:55,149
Speaker 0: and I will tell you this we have scheduled more panels Workshops and events in the 11 panel of workshop rooms we have than any Connecticut has ever had which means if you show up you're gonna see even less percentage of the stuff there is to see.

433
00:25:55,932 --> 00:25:59,946
Speaker 0: But at the same time it's a amount of time you there is no way I'm gonna.

434
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,695
Speaker 0: I'm gonna take Saturday All right.

435
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:09,546
Speaker 0: Saturday at 2 o'clock You could see story time with the vagabonds Q&A with the macho men of video game voice acting.

436
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:15,349
Speaker 0: Michelle Lang's She's a guest of the con to Jeopardy stuck, which is a homestuck panel.

437
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:16,634
Speaker 1: Why did we allow that?

438
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:21,590
Speaker 0: because home sucks popular and of the 11 that were submitted I picked the two that looked best.

439
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:22,834
Speaker 1: Jeopardy stuck.

440
00:26:22,894 --> 00:26:24,298
Speaker 0: the D&D we never knew.

441
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,493
Speaker 0: the 36 chamber an intro to kung fu cinema I'm going there.

442
00:26:28,513 --> 00:26:32,730

Speaker 1: You can go to this con and just play board games.

453
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:02,995
Speaker 1: I've said this before best board games there are at any convention I've been to ever.

454
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,844
Speaker 0: that includes any acts and mags.

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,801
Speaker 1: This is the best game library ever and it by playing just by playing games.

457
00:27:09,882 --> 00:27:11,667
Speaker 1: even if you lose you get tickets.

458
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:17,210
Speaker 1: a very small Amount of tickets will get you free games that are worth a lot of money and real dollars.

459
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:19,889
Speaker 1: You can pay for your own badge just like playing a lot of board games.

460
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:24,376
Speaker 1: Connecticut okay Pax prime is Labor Day.

461
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,440
Speaker 1: You know the score.

462
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,246
Speaker 0: probably be there Pax devs.

463
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:30,262
Speaker 0: before that there's a chance I will be there maybe with Scott.

464
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:35,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, if Scott's not there It's just because he doesn't want to spend vacation days because I don't have them all right.

Speaker 1: Reminding you of what geek nights has done in the past couple weeks with some other content in there as well.

473
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:11,910
Speaker 1: email reminder of what?

474
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,552
Speaker 1: we're up to.

Speaker 1: if you like email reminders you can go to front recruitment calm and Subscribe to the email newsletter.

476
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:20,970
Speaker 1: all the only information you have to type in is your email address.

477
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,877
Speaker 1: unsubscribing actually works.

478
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:24,223
Speaker 1: mail chimp just takes care of it.

479
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,342
Speaker 1: and It's so far.

480
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:27,947
Speaker 1: I wrote one email.

481
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:30,078
Speaker 1: People didn't seem to complain.

482
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,384
Speaker 1: so there you go.

483
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:33,593
Speaker 1: if you like email newsletters I know.

484
00:28:33,693 --> 00:28:42,086
Speaker 0: if you don't like email newsletters, then don't sign up all right, so uh UEFI has been in the news a lot, but only nerds care about it.

485
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:47,887
Speaker 0: and Cisco's cloud connect has been in the news a lot and only nerds care about it.

486
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:52,743
Speaker 0: mm-hmm This these both reek of a really fundamental problem.

487
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:53,786
Speaker 1: It's somebody's cloud care.

488
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:58,302
Speaker 1: cuz I looked up the cloud connect It was actually called on the website that I found the official Cisco website.

489
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:03,060
Speaker 0: It was called connect cloud, but on the website There's another site that said Cisco cloud vision.

490
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:18,200
Speaker 1: uh-huh so what I read was that it's pretty much You know we have this problem where you have your home network But your ISP gives you dynamic IPS and they suck and you have a router that gnats you so it's very hard to provide Services from your home internet service.

491
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:19,445
Speaker 1: can you know internet connection?

492
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:20,890
Speaker 1: so with this cloud connect?

493
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,019
Speaker 1: Theoretically does or connect cloud is on your router.

494
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:24,821
Speaker 1: your router links.

495
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,345
Speaker 1: this router supports connect cloud.

496
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:27,949
Speaker 1: you can get apps for it.

497
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:38,030
Speaker 1: So for example you could enable the file transferring app and then no matter where you were in the world You'd be able to connect to the computers in your house as if it was the cloud.

498
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:46,287
Speaker 1: You know a cloud service and upload and send files back and forth to your house from anywhere as if you were Hosting cloud things at your house.

499
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:53,970
Speaker 1: There are already a lot of equipments that a lot of NAS is do this where they'll use UPnP and a dynamic DNS service to achieve the same effect.

500
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:59,050
Speaker 1: So that's what the cloud connect thing does according to the website.

501
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,299
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna read a statement from one of many articles about this.

502
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,419
Speaker 0: alright last week a number of Cisco customers bit began reporting problems with three specific links.

503
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:10,270
Speaker 0: is routers the E2700 e3500 e4500.

504
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:21,573
Speaker 0: okay one day they attempted to log in and They were told to log in and register using their Cisco connect cloud account information, which they did not have accounts They was.

505
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:28,010
Speaker 0: there was no way to get into their own physical router without registering with Cisco cloud connect.

506
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:35,189
Speaker 0: Cisco had silently upgraded their firmware removed any option of downgrading and forced them to set this up.

507
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:39,090
Speaker 0: Cisco now controlled their router.

508
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:40,688
Speaker 0: So it gets worse.

509
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:42,656
Speaker 0: It gets way worse.

510
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:47,170
Speaker 1: cuz they want you to cry cuz the way it works is you have to log in to the Cisco server.

511
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:52,962
Speaker 1: So once you run on the cloud And then that connects you to your router manage your router.

512
00:30:53,263 --> 00:31:00,180
Speaker 0: you can no longer manage your own router anymore And there's no way to turn it off once it happens.

513
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:02,430
Speaker 0: There's no way to do anything with your router.

514
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,378
Speaker 0: Suddenly they have power over you.

515
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:05,423
Speaker 0: so it gets way worse.

516
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:13,330
Speaker 0: I'm going to read a few sentences from the actual Terms of service of this thing which you are now forced to use if you want.

517
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,423
Speaker 1: Did you search other routers terms of service to see if they say similar?

518
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:18,190
Speaker 0: No this isn't router terms of service.

519
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,466
Speaker 0: This is Cisco cloud connect terms of service or your router.

520
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:27,710
Speaker 0: if you're using it All right as the condition of your use of the service you agree that your sister blah blah blah will comply with all applicable laws.

521
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,213
Speaker 0: blah blah blah.

522
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:38,185
Speaker 0: you agree to not use or permit the use of the service to invade another's privacy to for obscene pornographic or offensive purposes.

523
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:53,564
Speaker 0: so you Another's rights including but not limited to intellectual property rights to email upload or otherwise transmitter make available unauthorized Advertising promotional materials spam junk mail or any form of solicitation.

524
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:55,230
Speaker 1: because you know how this thing probably works.

525
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,710
Speaker 1: It's probably not doing just dynamic DNS with a you know an IP hole on your router.

526
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,930
Speaker 1: What it's probably doing is you're sending stuff to Cisco's cloud servers, and then they're sending it to your router.

527
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:09,090
Speaker 1: That's probably how it works, and they don't want you to put that shit on their servers.

528
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:13,640
Speaker 0: so Yeah, yeah, so basically without now.

529
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:34,749
Speaker 0: It looks like after the crazy nerd outcry They backpedaled and they provided instructions on how to like physically reset And then download the old firmware and get your router back, but that's not the end of this and we're gonna see what happens because once Cisco controls my router and not me fuck you Cisco.

530
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:38,128
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I don't know anybody's buying a Cisco router.

531
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:38,410
Speaker 1: everyone.

532
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:40,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, you mean you mean a linksys router.

533
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:50,170
Speaker 1: I mean everyone knows that the good linksys router is the oldest best one Yes, you are t54g and that every other linksys router except for that one is shit alright.

534
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,642
Speaker 0: So if I need to buy a new router today, which one do I buy?

535
00:32:52,662 --> 00:32:54,170
Speaker 0: the one I have all right?

536
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,089
Speaker 0: Which one is that the netgear?

537
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:59,583
Speaker 1: WNDR 3700. there's actually slightly newer better ones.

538
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,830
Speaker 0: so we cool with the world where Cisco if you buy a Cisco router you don't know better.

539
00:33:04,294 --> 00:33:06,129
Speaker 0: You know you just plug it in and it just starts working.

540
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:10,209
Speaker 0: But Cisco actually now controls it and can do stuff to you.

541
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:23,076
Speaker 1: This is why we say every person who uses computers no matter how you know No, you know little technological stuff You think you're involved in you need to fucking learn computers.

542
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:33,838
Speaker 1: no matter if you're a plumber or a schoolteacher or a student Everyone in the world needs to know computers so that you don't get fucked anyone who doesn't learn computers.

543
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:37,640
Speaker 1: in the modern world You will be fucked by companies pulling the shit out.

544
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:40,071
Speaker 0: So here's another part of the privacy statement.

545
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:43,203
Speaker 0: if you're using a router that has this When you use the service.

546
00:33:43,384 --> 00:33:49,300
Speaker 1: Cisco can look at all your internets yeah, and they send it to Cisco among they specifically track your internet history.

547
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:52,160
Speaker 0: Yep, there you go and all network traffic.

548
00:33:52,541 --> 00:34:07,968
Speaker 1: The thing is a nerd who was using one of these right could be smart enough to VPN And it wouldn't even matter to you right because if I'd use my little eye Predator VPN for my laptop, and I happen to can say a coffee shop is using this you know crappy Cisco router I'll be totally safe.

549
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:10,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this would be like buying a router.

550
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,033
Speaker 0: That's a black box that someone else controls and just trusting it.

551
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,359
Speaker 1: well you see what they want to do in the UK.

552
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:34,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, trying to push a thing where the force is PS to install black boxes and those black boxes basically Will man in the middle all the SSL gmails and things like of that nature so that the UK government can spy on pretty much everyone using a UK is be And that's why I will not live there.

553
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:43,994
Speaker 0: So that if I did if I visited there I would VPN all the time, but much more dangerous to the health of computers everywhere.

554
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:48,628
Speaker 0: this this harkens back to like CBD TPA kind of stuff right.

555
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:57,900
Speaker 1: so this is thing and it's been coming for a while But now it's really on the verge of coming out for real, and it's starting to you know the talk about it is greatly increased.

556
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:04,319
Speaker 1: It's called EFI right well It's really the name for is secure boot, which is a facet of oh you EFI.

557
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:10,340
Speaker 1: well Yeah, so if I support secure boot basically yeah, so secure boot is a feature of an people don't know.

558
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,533
Speaker 1: Let's go back to the beginning right.

559
00:35:11,573 --> 00:35:20,850
Speaker 1: so PCs have BIOS right and max use basically the newer better replacement for BIOS Which is EFI which is this Intel thing right?

560
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:26,253
Speaker 1: It's it's basically something firmware or something I was gonna ask because I don't think it's enhanced firmware interface.

561
00:35:26,313 --> 00:35:28,060
Speaker 1: Maybe something like that anyway.

562
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:30,186
Speaker 1: So it's basically a better BIOS.

563
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:30,347
Speaker 1: is?

564
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:37,531
Speaker 1: that's why you can't just easily installed like Windows directly out of Mac without like boot camp Weirdness because Windows is built for BIOS.

565
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:38,596
Speaker 1: It's not built for EFI.

566
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:50,400
Speaker 1: so For Windows 8 right they're gonna finally move to EFI which is better than BIOS But has all these features such as restrictions and whatnot which is why you can't just install Windows on a Mac hardware.

567
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,931
Speaker 1: so anyway That's an EFI is no problem really right.

568
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:55,915
Speaker 1: everyone can deal with that.

569
00:35:55,935 --> 00:36:03,631
Speaker 1: the problem is that the Windows 8 they are making a contractual agreement right.

570
00:36:03,651 --> 00:36:05,215
Speaker 1: this is Microsoft is forcing this.

571
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:13,220
Speaker 1: Microsoft is saying look if You want right on your computers that you're selling to put a sticker that says Windows 8 compatible

572
00:36:14,065 --> 00:36:14,286
Speaker 0: You

573
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,660
Speaker 1: must not only use UAF I

574
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:17,643
Speaker 0: you

575
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:36,799
Speaker 1: have to and have it secure boot, which is a feature of UFI installed and Loaded and configured on that hardware, so if a motherboard wants to say we're compatible with Windows 8 in their marketing Microsoft will not let them do that and will sue them if they say it unless they have UFI and secure boot, so what is secure boot?

576
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,300
Speaker 1: Secure boot is also known by some people as restricted boot.

577
00:36:41,943 --> 00:36:45,618
Speaker 1: What this does is let's say you got it's sort of what the TiVo does.

578
00:36:45,698 --> 00:36:49,020
Speaker 1: it's in fact It's exactly what the TiVo did only standardized.

579
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:56,747
Speaker 1: So what TiVo did is they people were buying TiVos and trying to replace the operating system on there But they couldn't because the TiVo would refuse to boot.

580
00:36:57,088 --> 00:37:01,403
Speaker 1: unless you had the exact TiVo software and any other TiVo software It wouldn't boot.

581
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:03,718
Speaker 1: so secure boot is like that same thing.

582
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:03,778
Speaker 1: it.

583
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,654
Speaker 1: You have some software your operating system, and there is some key some security key.

584
00:37:08,714 --> 00:37:16,662
Speaker 1: the operating system has alright and that there's a hash of the operating system matches a certain number so you can't fake it and They can.

585
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:22,305
Speaker 1: when the computer turns on it looks at the operating system, and it says is that the operating system I'm supposed to boot?

586
00:37:22,345 --> 00:37:23,935
Speaker 1: now the hardware is doing this right.

587
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,503
Speaker 1: this isn't some software You can change.

588
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:32,299
Speaker 1: the hardware knows about a particular program And it will refuse to start any other program when the computer boots.

589
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:39,428
Speaker 0: now This is a lot like SSL in terms of certificates work in that you have to trust someone to sign stuff Or this is all pointless.

590
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:41,178
Speaker 0: so basically all right.

591
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:47,798
Speaker 0: well We'll trust Microsoft to sign stuff and the only thing they're gonna sign is their own software And you can pay them a hundred bucks, and they'll do it.

592
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:51,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, so every everyone who wants to make malware should pay them a hundred bucks.

593
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:51,397
Speaker 1: right?

594
00:37:51,437 --> 00:38:01,619
Speaker 1: so let's say I buy a motherboard with secure boot and a new Intel chip And I load it up big time and then I write an assembly program that does some cool graphical demo And I want to run that assembly program.

595
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:06,440
Speaker 1: I want to put it in the master bootloader and just boot it directly on the chips that I have bought.

596
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:11,739
Speaker 1: Well my that software is not signed by anyone.

597
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:16,760
Speaker 0: What if I want to install a Linux distro that didn't go through the hoops and get a signature right?

598
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,180
Speaker 1: I make my roll my own Linux distro with my own kernel and my own bootloader.

599
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:26,359
Speaker 0: And there's also a problem that you can't have multiple signatures for a piece of software right.

600
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:28,324
Speaker 1: and Now this is fine.

601
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:34,280
Speaker 1: the hardware is gonna look at my custom Linux, or it's gonna look at my you know cool assembly program.

602
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:39,724
Speaker 1: I wrote that runs directly on the hardware, and it's gonna say that's not one of the programs I'm supposed to be running.

603
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:45,800
Speaker 0: I ain't gonna boot now once you can't load arbitrary software on your computer It's not your computer anymore No kidding.

604
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:57,018
Speaker 0: But Microsoft backed off a little bit in that you can self sign and turn off the like mandatory higher up signature stuff for Windows on Intel

605
00:38:57,622 --> 00:38:57,823
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm

606
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:12,640
Speaker 0: like x86 architecture, so on ARM They're mandating that any hardware that Windows will be certified for that has that sticker Cannot allow anything that is not signed by them to run on it under any circumstance

607
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,143
Speaker 1: Or they won't.

608
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:16,742
Speaker 1: well if you can make such hardware and sell it if you want to know But they

609
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:18,509
Speaker 0: won't let you have it to be certified

610
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:25,639
Speaker 1: exactly you won't be able to have that sticker that says Windows 8 Compatible or whatever and you can't and they definitely can't sell it with Windows already installed on it

611
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:25,800
Speaker 0: now.

612
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:36,903
Speaker 0: that's a big deal because the What if you add a barrier to entry to install non Microsoft OS is the vast majority of people are incapable of getting around those Barriers exactly.

613
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:37,666
Speaker 1: I mean already.

614
00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:53,038
Speaker 1: people have trouble when they want to install Linux like telling their computer to boot from USB or CD ROM Instead of you know from the hard drive That's already in there Which is what you need to do if you want to actually reinstall Linux for reals which is why people had things like wubby Which is kind of crap, but it kind of works.

615
00:39:54,201 --> 00:40:01,740
Speaker 1: so to make people do even harder work of like signing something with a security key and Doing the equivalent of that messing around in the BIOS or the setup screen.

616
00:40:02,422 --> 00:40:11,778
Speaker 1: It's gonna be even harder to get people to install Linux instead of Windows or something like that right now or Absolutely impossible because their hardware will not allow it now.

617
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:26,887
Speaker 1: in Theory the secure boot feature having it on your computer is not so bad because what you can do for example is You can install Linux distribution or Windows and you could then enable it and say all right look you know Secure boot see what's installed right now.

618
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:31,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see that don't run anything else, but that okay, and this would be the good.

619
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:34,311
Speaker 1: You know implementation be theoretical good implementation.

620
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:35,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, what are the first name?

621
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:36,440
Speaker 0: install right?

622
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:45,626
Speaker 1: So then if say some virus or evil hacker or something came around and modified your operating system your computer would say hey I'm not booting in fact.

623
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:51,812
Speaker 1: I'm not even running anymore, and you would bet very well you would know immediately Oh someone hacked and screwed with my operating system.

624
00:40:52,154 --> 00:40:55,147
Speaker 1: I better reflash that shit Reinstall that part.

625
00:40:55,207 --> 00:41:01,211
Speaker 1: you know the boot loading part so that it's clean again And you would just do that and you would be all set and that would be secure boot.

626
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:05,986
Speaker 1: the problem is the the restricted Secure boot the evil implementation.

627
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:13,278
Speaker 1: the user is unable to tell the the motherboard or the CPU That no you should trust this.

628
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:20,420
Speaker 1: It's the people telling the computer what to trust our companies who make ironing systems and not the person who owns that computer.

629
00:41:20,922 --> 00:41:25,337
Speaker 1: I should be able to tell my computer trust this Linux trust that Linux trust this.

630
00:41:25,577 --> 00:41:26,300
Speaker 1: I want to run DOS.

631
00:41:26,761 --> 00:41:27,685
Speaker 1: What's it called free DOS.

632
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:28,548
Speaker 1: trust this free DOS?

633
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:30,274
Speaker 1: It's cool, but you can't do that.

634
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:43,540
Speaker 0: the way they're doing things now It's you know like Ubuntu and Red Hat are both like working and getting around this and they're doing deals with Microsoft to make It easy for now, but the pragmatic solution right now is not the thing that bothers me.

635
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:52,691
Speaker 0: What bothers me is that we as technologists cannot tolerate going down this road at all because I'm not making the slippery slope argument This is not a slippery slope.

636
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:54,440
Speaker 1: This is the horrible thing at the bottom.

637
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:08,200
Speaker 0: We don't need to slide anywhere because if your boot itself is bad if we tolerate an implementation like this This is the kind of stuff like the CBD tPA that a lot of people in our government would really like to have.

638
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:10,353
Speaker 1: Yep, remember this evening you basically want.

639
00:42:10,373 --> 00:42:11,520
Speaker 1: there was a decade ago.

640
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,971
Speaker 0: You know how hard we had to fight to get that shot down.

641
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:15,800
Speaker 1: what will happen here if this goes?

642
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:27,520
Speaker 1: You know full-on if no one makes motherboards that don't have this anymore is you'll basically Have to buy as soon as it comes out the last motherboard CPU combination that doesn't have this bullshit funny.

643
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:30,568
Speaker 1: When are you going to be able to upgrade?

644
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:35,873
Speaker 0: never I remember in 2002. give or take posting the Posting or reading.

645
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:36,720
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

646
00:42:36,883 --> 00:42:46,252
Speaker 0: You know I'm an old man But that exact argument was made in 2002 because if the CBD tPA had passed We would have all had to buy the last free hardware

647
00:42:46,452 --> 00:42:46,673
Speaker 1: yep,

648
00:42:47,054 --> 00:42:52,900
Speaker 0: and then from there forth somehow We would had to make do and there would have been an underground in illegal technology.

649
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:55,369
Speaker 1: Oh, well not necessarily legal right in that case.

650
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:57,135
Speaker 0: It would have been at least in this case.

651
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:00,900
Speaker 1: It's not illegal technology It's simply not Microsoft certified technology.

652
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:10,295
Speaker 1: So I would hope now that there would be a some Chinese some manufacturer of hardware that would Continue to make non certified stuff and we thought we could get it on new way.

653
00:43:10,316 --> 00:43:13,531
Speaker 0: governments of the world Not to sound paranoid have a vested interest.

654
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:18,880
Speaker 0: the idea of trusted computing Flies pretty much directly in the face of free computing.

655
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:19,578
Speaker 0: What is made?

656
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,749
Speaker 0: Technology great and open communication to the world forever the computer.

657
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:35,285
Speaker 0: the idea that we can have a generic computing thing a machine that does Computations that can do any kind of computation has probably revolutionized mankind more than anything else We've ever done in our entire history.

658
00:43:35,345 --> 00:43:35,847
Speaker 1: and the road.

659
00:43:35,887 --> 00:43:36,931
Speaker 1: We're going down now.

660
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:48,524
Speaker 1: iPad iPod all Mac Everything is a road where the you can buy machines that are theoretically capable of computing anything but Forces beyond your control.

661
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:57,670
Speaker 1: companies and governments are going to design that hardware in such a way that they will decide what computations those things can perform and what they cannot.

662
00:43:58,171 --> 00:44:10,900
Speaker 1: and it might even get so if they put it in the hardware and There is no hardware company on earth that cooperates It may get to the point where even nerds won't be able to compute whatever they want to compute now.

663
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:11,520
Speaker 0: It's fine.

664
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,460
Speaker 0: If we have divergent paths like an iPad that's really locked down is fine in an ecosystem.

665
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,700
Speaker 1: It's okay for it to exist.

666
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:26,680
Speaker 0: It just can't be the only exactly in an ecosystem where there are also free computers But without free access to your own hardware to do whatever you want with.

667
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:30,612
Speaker 0: You know short of you know, if I fill it with c4 and blow it up.

668
00:44:30,672 --> 00:44:31,816
Speaker 0: Well, that's a bomb.

669
00:44:31,856 --> 00:44:33,060
Speaker 0: That's not a computer, right?

670
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:50,040
Speaker 0: but The fact that computing devices are open and free and then I can I can type whatever the fuck I want into that thing is Probably one of the most important things humans can do right now Because ideas and memes are the only way to fight things that we perceive as being bad in the world.

671
00:44:50,765 --> 00:44:52,840
Speaker 1: So there's there's an additional issue here, right?

672
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,606
Speaker 1: Which is the GPL v3.

673
00:44:54,787 --> 00:45:13,739
Speaker 1: now some people use the GPL v3 and some aren't but in fact What happened is because of the TVO which I already explained the GPL v3 in most of its uses has clauses Specifically not allowing the TVO trick of you know, you're only allowing signed whatever's.

674
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:17,891
Speaker 1: So in fact what Ubuntu is doing to get around this problem?

675
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:27,869
Speaker 1: because right part of what they are doing is not using grub2 as their bootloader anymore because That would violate the GPL v3.

676
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,460
Speaker 1: for them to do what they're doing to get around the secure boot.

677
00:45:31,346 --> 00:45:40,099
Speaker 1: So they're actually switching to an Intel Bootloader for the later Ubuntu versions that has a more open license than the GPL v3.

678
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:47,664
Speaker 1: Well, so it's gonna be really weird to see what happens because suddenly you might get it, you know Linux itself is GPL v2.

679
00:45:47,684 --> 00:46:02,700
Speaker 1: So it's still cool, but we might get into situations coming up where you know You've got a new computer You've managed to get around secure boot to install the OS you want but no GPL v3 software can be run on your computer.

680
00:46:03,362 --> 00:46:07,678
Speaker 1: Be unless you know you you know without violating the GPL v3.

681
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:11,071
Speaker 1: So it's gonna get shaky real shaky.

682
00:46:11,091 --> 00:46:15,951
Speaker 0: Well, that's that's a separate problem of Free as in beer free as in speech.

683
00:46:15,971 --> 00:46:18,080
Speaker 0: I like and free as in GNU.

684
00:46:18,284 --> 00:46:27,049
Speaker 1: Yeah but the free there is stuff that is freezing GNU and there's might be some divergence and some troubles and Get a certain program to run where I

685
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:38,920
Speaker 0: want pragmatism to prevail in that I Am less concerned about binary blob like Nvidia drivers than I am about hardware restrictions

686
00:46:40,044 --> 00:46:40,225
Speaker 1: You know.

687
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:49,987
Speaker 1: and then there's always the concern we bring up all the time Which is like even if we come out of this, okay, and nerds can still buy open motherboards and CPUs a new egg Great.

688
00:46:50,027 --> 00:47:00,132
Speaker 1: We're still in that situation where Yeah, we told you so a hundred times Nerds have freedom and no one else does the CBD tPA passes.

689
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:06,497
Speaker 0: that would have meant that if I made a mashup of my little pony Normal people could not watch it.

690
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:15,909
Speaker 0: Hardware could not play media at the hardware level unless that media was signed by government Bodies saying it was legit and not pirated.

691
00:47:16,591 --> 00:47:17,714
Speaker 0: think about that for a minute.

692
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:19,440
Speaker 0: Think about what that would do to free speech.

693
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,749
Speaker 0: Hardware restrictions like this are basically attempts at that.

694
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,859
Speaker 1: Yep, and if you look at something like the iPad you could totally get there.

695
00:47:29,864 --> 00:47:35,634
Speaker 0: We're fine with the iPad being there But imagine a world where iPad is the only way to compute and it's already.

696
00:47:35,674 --> 00:47:36,135
Speaker 1: and it's not.

697
00:47:36,215 --> 00:47:40,039
Speaker 0: even you can't write an ad Unless the government says it's okay to write an ad.

698
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,683
Speaker 0: I imagine that.

699
00:47:40,703 --> 00:47:41,206
Speaker 1: and it's not.

700
00:47:41,307 --> 00:47:44,003
Speaker 1: and the thing is it's even take the government out of it right.

701
00:47:44,426 --> 00:47:58,579
Speaker 1: if we merely get to the point where Consumers like it the most so it becomes the most popular Right, then even if governments aren't forcing you to do that and all the nerds have open computers where they can do whatever they want Normal people won't have them.

702
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:12,672
Speaker 1: so if you make open media right and you know Apple or some corporate gatekeeper doesn't like you you can't get it spread out there because Everyone is using these lockdown things even though they don't have to Side argument.

703
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:22,340
Speaker 0: as long as we have real open computing platforms Then the nerds who care can use those platforms to circumvent the controls on other.

704
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:29,800
Speaker 1: But we still need the open platform to be the most popular platform Even if I don't know if that's feasible in the modern.

705
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,483
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

706
00:48:30,503 --> 00:48:39,116
Speaker 1: That's the problem is that even if governments don't force a close even if you're not forced You're arguing that Huxley is the dystopia as opposed to Orwell.

707
00:48:39,276 --> 00:48:53,479
Speaker 1: if the closeness Right of iPad and you know secure boot systems become the most popular most widely spread systems then the government doesn't have to step in and it beat you to get the same effect.

708
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,615
Speaker 1: and Basically, we're only nerds are living free and everyone else is living locked down.

709
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:01,540
Speaker 1: I Still my choice and they wouldn't choose to leave.

710
00:49:01,741 --> 00:49:14,320
Speaker 0: I still think it's a separate argument because in this case this hardware lockdown is Much more immediate in effect and harder to route around Mm-hmm, at least if it's just software like lockdown platforms.

711
00:49:14,782 --> 00:49:19,140
Speaker 0: Then there the fact that the open platforms can be ubiquitous even if they're the minority.

712
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:27,915
Speaker 0: It's sort of a checks and balances where even if iPads are most popular if someone does something on the open platform That non nerd see and go hey, how come?

713
00:49:27,975 --> 00:49:28,639
Speaker 0: I can't do that?

714
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:33,120
Speaker 0: It puts pressure on the lockdown platform to allow analogous functionality.

715
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:42,710
Speaker 1: I could see and like a few years right when Windows 7 isn't really any good anymore and Windows 8 and 9 or whatever and OS X the only other choices Going back to full-on Linux.

716
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,199
Speaker 1: We're seeing steam come out on Linux.

717
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:49,139
Speaker 1: I bet valve this is at least you know, they're at least thinking about this a little tiny fraction of a bit.

718
00:49:49,747 --> 00:49:50,540
Speaker 1: You know of what?

719
00:49:51,200 --> 00:50:03,860
Speaker 0: That's why as long as we can keep open access to hardware then it'll always be a pendulum because whenever Government or corporate intrusion gets too high and starts restricting what people actually want to do with their technology.

720
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:10,819
Speaker 0: Those people will go to their nerd friends and say hey How come I can't do all those things because you bought an iPad or Windows 8 computer dumbass.

721
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,890
Speaker 0: That's why there have been periods in my life.

722
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,937
Speaker 0: You know, I've been using computers for a long time.

723
00:50:15,977 --> 00:50:16,640
Speaker 0: We're old now.

724
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:29,660
Speaker 0: we've known geek night since 2005 and There have been eras where there have been big shifts in normal ish people toward Linux because they'd say hey I want to do X and Y and they couldn't really do that on their more closed platforms.

725
00:50:30,303 --> 00:50:38,723
Speaker 0: if the iPad model gets too closed and Nerds continue to do cool things there will always be this pushback But no close.

726
00:50:38,943 --> 00:50:41,713
Speaker 1: but how will normal people know about the cool things nerds do?

727
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:46,119
Speaker 1: because nerds never shut the fuck up But they can't see us on the internet because they're all locked down.

728
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:49,753
Speaker 0: They can see us on the internet because at least for now.

729
00:50:49,853 --> 00:50:51,278
Speaker 0: Yes, and that's the for now.

730
00:50:51,318 --> 00:51:01,986
Speaker 0: That's why That's why as much as we complain about this stuff the CBD tPA was literally the worst most Egregious attempt at this.

731
00:51:02,248 --> 00:51:04,760
Speaker 1: Anyway, here's my pragmatic strategy for the near future.

732
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,523
Speaker 1: Right number one.

733
00:51:05,644 --> 00:51:13,732
Speaker 1: if this becomes so prevalent that like every motherboard has it you can't build, you know I'm planning to build a computer like two three years away, but I might wow You're really gonna hold out two or three years.

734
00:51:13,813 --> 00:51:14,499
Speaker 1: my computer's just fun.

735
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:16,144
Speaker 0: I guess you're not editing video.

736
00:51:16,786 --> 00:51:22,200
Speaker 1: if I have to I'll just buy the last great computer that doesn't have this bullshit.

737
00:51:23,222 --> 00:51:39,411
Speaker 1: If there's still like some motherboard companies that are still producing good, you know And CPU companies still making computers that don't have the bullshit or have ways around it that they just they say Yeah, the motherboard was selling a new egg doesn't need to say Windows 8 compatible on the on the box You know, then we're pretty good, right?

738
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:40,417
Speaker 1: We can just buy those motherboards.

739
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:40,940
Speaker 1: We'll be all set.

740
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:52,760
Speaker 1: If it gets bad and there isn't a motherboard that's like that or a CPU that's like that Then I'm gonna start a Kickstarter to get enough monies to get like aces or someone to make a motherboard like that.

741
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, and secure boot will make sure that your web browser can't go to that Kickstarter.

742
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:00,030
Speaker 1: I don't think no secure boot at least for now.

743
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,760
Speaker 1: No slippery slope is just operating system.

744
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,850
Speaker 1: So it's really just an issue.

745
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,297
Speaker 0: and other than ARM it is.

746
00:52:07,442 --> 00:52:12,420
Speaker 0: Actually even with ARM in certain situations is circumventable, but it pushes normal consumers.

747
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:15,510
Speaker 0: It adds a barrier to the even makes it hard.

748
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:18,420
Speaker 1: you even you couldn't even run Windows XP on such a computer.

749
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:21,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, your Windows 7 even right unless maybe they sign that.

750
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:25,185
Speaker 1: but the thing is you it would be hard to run Something that was.

751
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,459
Speaker 0: the idea of a secure platform that I can enable is awesome.

752
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,960
Speaker 1: If I'm running a company that they just give me give me the feature and let me choose.

753
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:34,305
Speaker 1: Yeah, what the key is?

754
00:52:34,406 --> 00:52:38,020
Speaker 0: I run the IT of a small company that has like sensitive financial information.

755
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:41,858
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone gets a laptop with an encrypted hard drive and a crazy secure boot.

756
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:47,520
Speaker 1: Yep Bam done, but you can't force I have to be the one to put the key in the secure boot.

757
00:52:47,685 --> 00:52:52,740
Speaker 1: I you know I can't have a lock on my house or someone else decides what the lock looks like and holds all the keys.

758
00:52:53,161 --> 00:52:55,972
Speaker 1: I can't open my house unless Microsoft opens it for me.

759
00:52:56,032 --> 00:52:58,059
Speaker 0: It's the same fundamental problem with self-signed SSL.

760
00:52:58,421 --> 00:53:04,461
Speaker 0: It's why if you want to use SSL and anyone's using it other than you You pretty much have to pay one of the gatekeepers for you Like

761
00:53:04,501 --> 00:53:09,459
Speaker 1: if you mortgage the house and every time you wanted to go in or out the bank came to open and close the door And lock it for you.

762
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:12,524
Speaker 1: And if you fucked up on the mortgage payment They would just lock you out.

763
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:16,589
Speaker 0: and if it's like Cisco's cloud thing if they find porn in your house Then they shut your house down.

764
00:53:16,871 --> 00:53:22,191
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, so ravel about this stuff kids ravel ravel ravel ravel.

765
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:27,526
Speaker 1: sign the EFF whatever's secure boot rest You know, whatever they want to call it restricted boot.

766
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,850
Speaker 0: You don't understand anything.

767
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,497
Speaker 0: We said just remember this UEFI is a UFIA.

768
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:42,928
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
