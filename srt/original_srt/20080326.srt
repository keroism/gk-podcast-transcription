5
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:40,753
Speaker 1: You know today I thought I'd be nice and I went and I got a melon pond as part of my lunch along with the curry pond and I got an extra melon pond that I was gonna bring home and he ate it.

6
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:42,600
Speaker 0: No, no, no, you lost it.

7
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:47,700
Speaker 1: No I was just going to leave it in Emily's apartment and then drive home and then she would get home and say what's this?

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,620
Speaker 1: Oh a melon pond, but she got out of work early.

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,900
Speaker 1: She had an appointment somewhere and she called me and said hey, let's all say hi before you catch your train.

10
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:59,640
Speaker 1: I go down and of all I had bought her a melon pond.

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,767
Speaker 1: She had independently bought me something to eat.

12
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:04,035
Speaker 1: So we traded things to eat and then went along our way.

13
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,405
Speaker 0: Alrighty Okay.

14
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:14,520
Speaker 0: No speaking of things to eat though You know this morning I had that I bought some high-quality peanut butters his two letters over the weekend.

15
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:15,623
Speaker 1: Oh that you did.

16
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:17,730
Speaker 0: I also ran out of jellies at work.

17
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:24,711
Speaker 0: So I put some jellies three jellies Unopened jellies and the peanut butter in a bag and I brought it to work.

18
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:25,914
Speaker 1: that bag gone.

19
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:29,602
Speaker 0: I left that bag on the train Outstanding.

20
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:31,830
Speaker 0: It's like all the train lost and found.

21
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:34,520
Speaker 0: and I'm like, yeah, I left this two letters bag on the train.

22
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:35,787
Speaker 0: Did anyone find it?

23
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:38,119
Speaker 0: They're like if it was food, they threw it out.

24
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:45,688
Speaker 0: Ah Even though it wasn't very perishable You know, I mean it would have lasted a day or two.

25
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:47,114
Speaker 0: it's peanut butter and jelly.

26
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:49,526
Speaker 0: jelly wasn't gonna go bad at all I don't know.

27
00:01:49,606 --> 00:01:54,758
Speaker 1: I mean I can see why they would have laws about that or You know, but at least you know for an hour or so.

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,280
Speaker 0: I mean if someone calls right back, but I basically got to work and I was just like fuck.

29
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:05,500
Speaker 1: I have a feeling what actually happened is the person you called was probably eating a delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

30
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:11,260
Speaker 0: If I get to go now, right and I had to continue eating my not as good peanut butter until I can get some more.

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,700
Speaker 1: That's harsh because you know that you had the potential to have better peanut.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
Speaker 0: I know I only ate it once and now I got to go buy all new jellies.

33
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,006
Speaker 0: It's like three jellies a lot of money.

34
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,672
Speaker 0: It's like almost ten dollars.

35
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,579
Speaker 1: I spent more than that on lunch today.

36
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:28,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, I went out for like sushi lunch today, but I got it.

37
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:29,280
Speaker 0: I got a don.

38
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:34,860
Speaker 1: I also went out and got sushi lunch and I got sushi and a melon pan and a curry pie.

39
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,070
Speaker 0: It was a weird don because it this place.

40
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,033
Speaker 0: I got it at right.

41
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:41,260
Speaker 0: they put a lot more stuff in there, right?

42
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,540
Speaker 0: So it was kind of more interesting than the Don's I'm used to but they also put some stuff in there.

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,799
Speaker 0: That was sort of tasting like, you know, that's sort of fishy not the best sushi place in the world.

44
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:58,100
Speaker 0: flavor Like it got in my egg and I was kind of like Some bites were yummy and some bites at this.

45
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:04,969
Speaker 1: I actually really prefer the Don's from the yaga yaga remark as opposed to the ones from the cafe Right next door and they're also cheaper.

46
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:07,137
Speaker 1: So it's like alright the better one is cheaper.

47
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:09,124
Speaker 0: Yeah Workers though.

48
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:16,589
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, they're at the level where they're outrageous enough that they'll get sushi But they all just get like normal rolls.

49
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,555
Speaker 0: Just like the nose normal ones.

50
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:19,117
Speaker 0: They have.

51
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:25,386
Speaker 0: they're like, yeah give me like a California roll and a Philly roll and Spicy tuna man.

52
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,515
Speaker 1: We go to the neck over like that's a new roll.

53
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:28,217
Speaker 1: What's in it?

54
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:28,820
Speaker 1: Who cares?

55
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,651
Speaker 0: Give me the double garlic roll and that's like the second best roll ever.

56
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:35,640
Speaker 1: It's just whole cloves of fried garlic.

57
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:38,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm like, why don't you guys get like beef Don or something?

58
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:39,259
Speaker 0: They're like, what's that?

59
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:43,398
Speaker 0: Well, I remember when I was living the other guy was like the other guy.

60
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:45,126
Speaker 0: I was you know I started talking about the sushi train.

61
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:47,156
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, he's like, yeah, it's great.

62
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:48,864
Speaker 0: You just get all this stuff You don't even know what it is.

63
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:49,387
Speaker 0: Just eat it.

64
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:53,949
Speaker 0: and I'm like, you don't know what it is by looking at it Like I know what it is.

65
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:00,416
Speaker 1: Well, I remember let me assume Out this way and I was I had a landlady and her boyfriend and well that we're.

66
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:01,580
Speaker 1: they wanted to go to the grocery store.

67
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:10,424
Speaker 1: So I went with him and we went uptown and we passed by the osho Japanese steakhouse Mm-hmm, and I was like, ah, hey Japanese place I like Japanese food.

68
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:11,889
Speaker 1: and he was like what like sushi.

69
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,037
Speaker 1: and I was like no pretty much all of it.

70
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,858
Speaker 1: and he was like Well, what else is there?

71
00:04:17,244 --> 00:04:20,367
Speaker 1: and I was like, ah And I start naming things.

72
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,512
Speaker 1: He's like, ah, oh, huh?

73
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:22,055
Speaker 1: Huh?

74
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:29,180
Speaker 1: He apparently as far as he knew Japanese food consisted of steak or sushi.

75
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,148
Speaker 1: Really when I explained the concept of such.

76
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,800
Speaker 0: yes in Italy all they eat is pizza meatballs and spaghetti, but that's absolutely true.

77
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:37,894
Speaker 0: I did you shut up.

78
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:46,848
Speaker 1: So are we gonna talk about the the really big anime news or you want to go first, uh, I Think you can go first.

79
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:50,833
Speaker 0: I had some other opening bits Like I was thinking not you know, like that out.

80
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:51,817
Speaker 0: I had three openings.

81
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:55,177
Speaker 0: I can hold off But I forgot what they were.

82
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:58,851
Speaker 1: so they're They're gone cuz the elephants in the room.

83
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:03,128
Speaker 0: His name is anime Boston, but All right, so I got to do a geek bite.

84
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:05,478
Speaker 0: cuz there's no news and I'm gonna continue my plenty

85
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:06,201
Speaker 1: of news but go

86
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:16,640
Speaker 0: on anyway, so in the in the sort of comics community, right the The latest hubbub is sort of been about the Green Lantern and people are like, oh man

87
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:21,680
Speaker 1: The Green Lantern is probably one of the dumbest ideas for a superhero ever.

88
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,627
Speaker 0: Superhero ideas are dumb.

89
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:25,530
Speaker 0: No, not all.

90
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,940
Speaker 0: even even the Batman idea is dumb.

91
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:29,914
Speaker 1: How the Batman idea is not that tall.

92
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:30,640
Speaker 0: think about this.

93
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,925
Speaker 0: It's kind of a dumb idea.

94
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:36,863
Speaker 0: guy who's really rich lives in a cave and buys fancy things and as a butler It's not really.

95
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:38,127
Speaker 0: it's a pretty car.

96
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:43,363
Speaker 0: You know, it's not dumb at all as a sidekick wearing green underwear kick ass That's not dumb.

97
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:44,145
Speaker 0: That's not dumb.

98
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,491
Speaker 1: Well, it's dumb but in a different.

99
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:51,406
Speaker 0: but anyway anyway, but you know the new Green Lantern stuff Apparently, I don't know the deal with it.

100
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:56,899
Speaker 0: But if people were just raving about it non-stop non-stop raving So I'm like, alright, I stand by.

101
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:10,696
Speaker 0: So I stand by my don't knock it till I try it policy and I say alright, you know you bitches You know hyping up your Green Lantern that I don't have a lot of confidence in right which in which Green Lantern should I read?

102
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:15,690
Speaker 1: Ah That's how I read comics is I?

103
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,988
Speaker 1: pretty much every time Scott's like you should read a comic I'm like, alright What's the best one?

104
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:20,692
Speaker 1: I haven't read.

105
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:25,131
Speaker 0: well I said, alright So this current story that you're raving about right?

106
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:26,075
Speaker 0: Where does it begin?

107
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:27,440
Speaker 0: What trade should I buy?

108
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,844
Speaker 0: Give me the ISBN number.

109
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:42,426
Speaker 0: So they gave me the ISBN number right and it's Green Lantern rebirth by Jeff Johns and the art is by Ethan Van Schuyver and Someone named Prentice Rollins.

110
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:43,348
Speaker 0: I don't know what the E does.

111
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:44,110
Speaker 0: I don't know.

112
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,451
Speaker 0: Anyway.

113
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:50,645
Speaker 0: Oh, here's the credits penciler Ethan Van Schuyver Anchors letter colorist, whatever.

114
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:51,026
Speaker 0: Okay.

115
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:56,834
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I read this the whole thing even though I'm gonna be honest I didn't want to finish it.

116
00:06:58,142 --> 00:06:59,125
Speaker 0: This is terrible.

117
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,209
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

118
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,054
Speaker 1: Well, could you enumerate?

119
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,719
Speaker 1: I mean, what was bad about it?

120
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,939
Speaker 0: Okay Well, basically his is the deal, right?

121
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:19,728
Speaker 0: At first I was thinking, you know as I my only premise, you know sort of prejudice against these sort of comics especially the DC ones is that they require a lot of Prerequisite knowledge to understand.

122
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:25,271
Speaker 0: I'm like because I know nothing about the Green Lantern other than that He has a ring and he doesn't like yellow.

123
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,283
Speaker 0: That's all I really know that It's gonna be.

124
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:38,935
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna understand the story and that actually was not true You see because in the in the front page here There's a who's who and it tells me who all six Green Lanterns are.

125
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:40,019
Speaker 1: there's six.

126
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:48,000
Speaker 1: Yes, I knew there was one and I think there was one that I knew was different because he was black.

127
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:49,225
Speaker 0: There's what.

128
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,089
Speaker 0: one of them is black.

129
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:51,194
Speaker 1: Yeah, are they all green?

130
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:52,540
Speaker 1: Is there like a red lantern?

131
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:03,250
Speaker 0: Well the original original original Green Lantern because if the Green Lantern and the Yellow Lantern teamed up don't can be them the super Original Green Lantern from the ancient olden days, right?

132
00:08:03,752 --> 00:08:06,260
Speaker 0: He's actually like not the same as the other ones.

133
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,340
Speaker 0: He's like a you know, sort of magic based and the other Green Lanterns are sort of space, you know with the Rings and such.

134
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,287
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway So that actually wasn't a problem.

135
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,294
Speaker 0: I understood the plot of this comic 100%.

136
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:19,796
Speaker 0: There was nothing.

137
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:23,146
Speaker 0: So I congratulate them on.

138
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:28,220
Speaker 0: you know, having a comic that sort of continues this incredible ongoing never-ending story.

139
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,394
Speaker 0: But someone who doesn't know that story could understand the plot that that was good.

140
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:34,299
Speaker 0: The art is also great.

141
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:41,509
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess it's not you know, the art that I'm gonna hang on my wall, but for comic book art It's like hey, this is pretty good arts here.

142
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,171
Speaker 0: I could look at this.

143
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:42,995
Speaker 0: It's not painful.

144
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:44,300
Speaker 0: It's pretty appealing.

145
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:55,593
Speaker 1: Does it have that that charm and class that was reminiscent of the days when I like the x-men a little bit a little bit The way the x-men looked that was epitomized in the Fox cartoon.

146
00:08:55,634 --> 00:09:00,391
Speaker 1: like that is that's the only kind of superhero I like other than I guess cool Batman.

147
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:05,880
Speaker 0: I can say that I would happily have mr Van Skyver draw some pirates in my sketchbook.

148
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:10,626
Speaker 0: Right What is wrong with this comic?

149
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:15,017
Speaker 0: Well, first of all while I understood everything that was going on, right?

150
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:27,840
Speaker 0: It seemed like When I was reading it that there were lots of references to things and I sort of got the references Like I understood them because I read the little who's who in the front like I understood what they were referencing.

151
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:33,887
Speaker 0: But it felt like it was sort of like there was a pointer You know that was supposed to like.

152
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:35,312
Speaker 0: I could tell that huh?

153
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:47,079
Speaker 0: That's supposed to make me go Like sort of like when you watch a remix of our mashup of things you like and you go Oh, man, look at that mashup and they make a reference to something, you know that, you know.

154
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:52,902
Speaker 0: But you know other people might not know and you sort of get that feeling, you know, like Like it's.

155
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,208
Speaker 0: I know I know, you know, I guess.

156
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:57,862
Speaker 0: so it makes like a clever Death Note joke, you know, and it's like You know.

157
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:03,800
Speaker 1: anytime someone ever says the words if this is a diplomatic mission, then where is the ambassador?

158
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:21,960
Speaker 0: Yes stuff like that, right and they it seemed like they did that a lot and not being someone who had a pre-existing Emotional attachment to any of these characters or to the story and just a knowledgeable, you know I guess knowledgeable is in terms of one page of text, right?

159
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:26,080
Speaker 0: It seemed like a lot of the emotions I was supposed to have all reading it?

160
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,707
Speaker 0: I didn't have.

161
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:35,151
Speaker 0: it was sort of like saying Hey you there Green Lantern fan who loves Green Lantern You should feel who right now because they're referencing something else.

162
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:39,712
Speaker 0: Ooh, and I'm like, no, I'm not feeling that right now But I can tell you're trying to evoke that emotion.

163
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,960
Speaker 0: It's so obvious.

164
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:47,960
Speaker 1: It's okay when a work does that because and there are works that had this extra level like they have stuff there for people who?

165
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,361
Speaker 1: Know.

166
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:54,020
Speaker 1: but yet you can enjoy it not even knowing any of that like watching the V for Vendetta movie.

167
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:59,440
Speaker 1: There were a ton of references to the comic but they didn't in any way get in the way of enjoying the movie.

168
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,600
Speaker 1: You can enjoy the movie and never even know there was a comic.

169
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:08,295
Speaker 0: The thing is is that while I you know, I was worried that without knowledge I wouldn't understand but I understood.

170
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:09,140
Speaker 0: wait a minute.

171
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,540
Speaker 0: There was no enjoyment to be had because all the enjoyment was in the form of references.

172
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:19,020
Speaker 1: Ah, so I was gonna say there is the problem simply that oh you understood it you understood it all too.

173
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:32,148
Speaker 0: Now the other problem I have with this right is that much like other DC comics I have read that instead of just sort of being a really close personal kind of story about the characters.

174
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:41,860
Speaker 0: it ends up being like this cavalcade story where this just Superman's here Batman's here Wonder Woman flash all these people just showing up green arrow.

175
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:45,687
Speaker 1: I think that comes out of the fact that Pretty much, they know like I mean

176
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:49,220
Speaker 0: you already have like five or six Green Lanterns to deal with

177
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:53,860
Speaker 1: All right, you know, I here's why I think they do that All right, so they know I'm gonna make up numbers to make it easy.

178
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:57,600
Speaker 1: They know that there's like eight people who like Superman and two people who like the flash.

179
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,887
Speaker 1: So if they've got a comic that has Superman in it They're gonna get eight people to buy it.

180
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:08,300
Speaker 1: if they put the flash in a little bit Then they're gonna get two more people to buy it and they put in the Green Lantern.

181
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:09,887
Speaker 1: One more dude's gonna buy it.

182
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:12,819
Speaker 1: and if they put in Wonder Woman then like five other people are gonna buy it.

183
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:13,122
Speaker 0: It's.

184
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:17,729
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's what they're thinking or not But it really it turns everything.

185
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:37,980
Speaker 0: every single story becomes sort of like this giant world spanning thing with everyone in it and it's really all about this like Unemotional plot where you don't actually have characterization you sort of have these Character templates and the plot just sort of acts on them and the characters don't act.

186
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,980
Speaker 0: They're not like burning wheel characters that you know, like live in life for what you believe.

187
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,447
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're just sort of like the instead of five.

188
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:48,400
Speaker 1: for you to believe your instincts are things like I hit you you little guy.

189
00:12:48,620 --> 00:13:01,369
Speaker 0: They're like the characters are the costumes really they're so two-dimensional and then they just this plot just sort of stirs them all up and then you see what happens and I Don't know why people are going crazy for this.

190
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:06,829
Speaker 0: Like this is like their favorite comic right now, but It's not my favorite comic right now.

191
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:07,411
Speaker 0: I'll read it.

192
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:08,375
Speaker 0: You want to read it?

193
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:08,917
Speaker 1: I'll read it.

194
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:10,482
Speaker 0: All right, you can read it I'll read it.

195
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,473
Speaker 1: I'll give any comic a fair shake.

196
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:15,560
Speaker 1: I'll shake it as I'm throwing it now.

197
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,945
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna make a joke like that.

198
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:30,707
Speaker 0: But the actually there was one aspect of the plot, which I enjoyed and Basically what the part of the thing and it's is that one of the Green Lanterns right is basically Unafraid and they keep it's.

199
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,254
Speaker 0: the thing is they're not subtle with it at all.

200
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:36,568
Speaker 1: They're like, he's not afraid and That could be done so much better.

201
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:38,236
Speaker 0: But anyway, well, it's it's actually.

202
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,467
Speaker 0: it's a really good Plot mechanism that I liked.

203
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:44,455
Speaker 0: but the only thing I didn't like about it is it wasn't subtle right.

204
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:48,608
Speaker 0: and here's is the deal Right, so he's not afraid.

205
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:54,673
Speaker 0: but Batman is all about, you know controlling people with fear so him and Batman don't get along.

206
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:59,212
Speaker 1: and it's sort of like The thing is I think that man can't control with fear.

207
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,360
Speaker 1: He controls with violence, right?

208
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:11,160
Speaker 0: Well, you can't because the dudes like a Green Lantern and Batman is just some guy and they Demonstrate that at one point because he just freaking punches Batman in the face, but I thought Batman kicked Superman's ass.

209
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:13,379
Speaker 0: This is uh, yeah, that's what people say.

210
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,075
Speaker 0: But yeah, anyway, there's a great like whole page where he's just punching Batman right in the face.

211
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,759
Speaker 0: what repeatedly now just once Batman survive?

212
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,348
Speaker 0: Well, cuz wait a minute.

213
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:22,831
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

214
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:27,567
Speaker 0: The Green Lantern doesn't have super strength He has a super ring So he punches you is just like a normal puzzle.

215
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:35,296
Speaker 1: Batman have that big stupid yellow plate With the passion in the face, so I did Batman just like poking with the yellow thing.

216
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:36,400
Speaker 0: What yellow thing?

217
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,990
Speaker 1: I don't know like the yellow plate with a bat on it.

218
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:41,038
Speaker 1: I've seen pictures of Batman with that stupid.

219
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:44,533
Speaker 1: Yeah Carry around yellow spray paint whenever that dudes.

220
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:45,840
Speaker 1: They'll actually this grill.

221
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:54,580
Speaker 0: They talk they talk about you know, there's that's that's part of the stupid plot is like Oh, why yellow this and why it doesn't do any more and blah blah blah blah blah and all that.

222
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:57,500
Speaker 0: There's a lot of trying to explain away.

223
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,340
Speaker 0: You know things, you know by you know, and they sort of try to incorporate the plot into the explanation.

224
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:10,720
Speaker 1: I just make a tank that's painted yellow and made out of kryptonite and I don't let any radio signals get in.

225
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,970
Speaker 1: So Batman can't mess with me.

226
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,179
Speaker 1: and then I robbed banks with it.

227
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:20,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, it was like that was one aspect of the story That was almost enjoyable, but they were so unsubtle and obvious with it.

228
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,360
Speaker 0: It's like if you had a great symbol symbolism and sort of message or like a little theme.

229
00:15:24,742 --> 00:15:39,456
Speaker 0: But then you just came out and just and that yelled it really loud, you know like Yeah, so I cannot recommend These green lanterns by the Geoff Johns that everyone is touting so much as being fantastic.

230
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:40,920
Speaker 0: They are not mighty.

231
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,924
Speaker 1: I'll read it.

232
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:46,460
Speaker 1: You might get a geek bite of my own about this in the near future.

233
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,217
Speaker 0: No, I think I'll just have to hear you going.

234
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:52,386
Speaker 1: God God It'll keep you up all night.

235
00:15:52,506 --> 00:15:56,020
Speaker 0: Plus if you're really if you're gonna read comics, you should read something good and not something bad.

236
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,064
Speaker 1: All right, what should I read next?

237
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:01,460
Speaker 1: I've already read Watchmen V for Vendetta and Batman the Dark Knight Returns.

238
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:03,956
Speaker 0: Oh, I'll go get something and bone.

239
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:05,960
Speaker 0: All right Well, I'll get something.

240
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:14,748
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk about this in great detail because I kind of want to wait until this happens and keeps happening and how would people react to it?

241
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:21,358
Speaker 1: and then I'll talk about it because half of this is it's about time and But the other half is is it too late?

242
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:33,139
Speaker 1: Gonzo their their new shows are going to be streamed on the internet zero day simultaneously with English subtitles in Japanese in America and the u.s.

243
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:41,880
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and this is with a crunchy roll in YouTube and some other thing and I don't want to go into all the details But for the love of God, it's about time.

244
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:47,720
Speaker 1: I wish Gonzo the best of luck with this because this is what the anime industry needs.

245
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:48,407
Speaker 1: None of this.

246
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:55,983
Speaker 1: Well, we're afraid of Re-importation so we're gonna make the Americans wait a year and by then everyone's pirated it and then we're not gonna market the show at All's.

247
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:56,838
Speaker 1: no one's gonna buy it.

248
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,300
Speaker 1: But yet we made all these DVDs now are fucked and then rim buys the DVDs for a dollar at an anime con two years later.

249
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,887
Speaker 0: No, you know what's gonna happen now?

250
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:05,493
Speaker 0: is they're gonna realize huh?

251
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:06,720
Speaker 0: We're giving it away for free.

252
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:09,147
Speaker 0: Look how many people are watching way.

253
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,540
Speaker 0: now we can actually tell that this show sucks and that show doesn't suck.

254
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:13,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, but think about this.

255
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,978
Speaker 1: Gonzo could make a good show.

256
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:20,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, they could they could they could.

257
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,919
Speaker 0: maybe they try plus give it away for free online.

258
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:26,460
Speaker 0: A lot of people watch the early episodes then they'll never get to the end and be disappointed.

259
00:17:26,723 --> 00:17:28,200
Speaker 1: But at the same time they're free.

260
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,320
Speaker 1: You're gonna looks like they'll have like you can pay to get higher quality versions and all sorts of stuff.

261
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,720
Speaker 1: But this this in general is really really really good news, and I hope it goes well.

262
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:44,599
Speaker 1: But I don't want to talk about that because I have something much more important to talk about Something that could have affected us.

263
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:45,560
Speaker 1: But I guess luckily.

264
00:17:46,202 --> 00:17:52,544
Speaker 1: But I say this kind of too facedly because at the same time I've wanted to go to anime Boston for like the last six Years, well,

265
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:59,280
Speaker 0: I don't I didn't really want to go to it like oh, man I really want to go to anime Boston, but it was sort of like hey, there's an anime convention right there.

266
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:00,122
Speaker 0: Why not go?

267
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:04,596
Speaker 0: it's also one of the like a couple hours away, and it's pretty significantly large.

268
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:05,920
Speaker 0: It's like katsu khan-sized.

269
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:07,265
Speaker 1: Oh, it's bigger than katsu khan.

270
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:08,389
Speaker 0: by far really.

271
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,055
Speaker 1: they had 15,000 people this year.

272
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:10,617
Speaker 0: how many katsu?

273
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:12,383
Speaker 0: kind of 6,000 something.

274
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:15,071
Speaker 0: oh really okay, I thought I always thought I'm a Boston.

275
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:22,818
Speaker 0: katsu khan was sort of similarly sized like not as big as Oda khan, but way bigger than like kinetic on, but I guess anime Boston is bigger than I thought.

276
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:27,120
Speaker 0: well thing is I didn't know a lot about anime Boston because I knew it was an anime convention in Boston.

277
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,286
Speaker 0: That was pretty big every year.

278
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,720
Speaker 1: It would come up and like you know we have our khan schedule.

279
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:34,366
Speaker 1: We go to a lot of khan's and actually The next khan we're going through.

280
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:37,780
Speaker 1: just for I'll talk about this more, but we're gonna be pressed at the New York comic-con.

281
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,760
Speaker 1: We're not doing any panels no table nothing.

282
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:42,330
Speaker 1: If you're gonna be there come say hi to us.

Speaker 0: well Well there will be times of meeting up.

285
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:55,279
Speaker 0: Probably look at what like comic podcast people are doing and stuff and also that thing ninja consultants have a table there Yeah, so we can go and bother them.

286
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:02,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, so every time I thought like I'd be reminded of anime Boston in this kind of conversation.

287
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:03,383
Speaker 1: Hey, Ram.

288
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:05,011
Speaker 1: You go to anime Boston tomorrow.

289
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:06,899
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess not.

290
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes, oh it was this weekend wasn't it?

291
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,855
Speaker 0: yeah, it's just.

292
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:16,617
Speaker 0: it's like I don't Track the convention, so I don't know when to reg and it doesn't happen.

293
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:23,301
Speaker 1: It's not like Otakon where I like have the RSS feed and and or like katsu khan where we sit there and read the staff Email.

294
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:29,884
Speaker 1: by the way I got to point out again katsu khan is awesome because we're already planning out the layout for the video game Room for next year.

295
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:37,860
Speaker 1: yeah, that's how it's gotta be but anime Boston did not Exhibit this level of foresight that katsu khan is so wonderfully brought to us.

296
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,740
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know was there video yet at all if their video game room was good or bad or any Boston in general.

297
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,594
Speaker 1: I don't know how many of you have heard it was on anime news network.

298
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:52,040
Speaker 1: We had a couple of friends there I think Mookie was there, but Basically they fucked up.

299
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,799
Speaker 1: Uh-huh and an anime Boston 2008 was full of epic lose and fail.

300
00:19:57,879 --> 00:19:59,570
Speaker 0: well I'm glad we didn't go then.

301
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:05,259
Speaker 1: the thing is I Kinda wish we had gone because we weren't what the thing that happened would not have affected us.

302
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:08,311
Speaker 1: We would have been inside going wow where is everybody?

303
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,178
Speaker 1: and then we would have walked outside and gone.

304
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:19,295
Speaker 1: oh But basically they Completely boot the registration at anime Boston.

305
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:24,820
Speaker 1: this year people were reporting Nine and ten plus our weights for badges.

306
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,851
Speaker 0: I mean Otakon has like more people.

307
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:29,899
Speaker 0: yet the reg so fast.

308
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:37,100
Speaker 1: Otakon has the best registration of any convention professional or otherwise I've ever been to in my entire life.

309
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:43,364
Speaker 0: Well, no, there is one better registration and that is where they mail you your non-counterfeitable badge in the mail And then you just walk in.

310
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:46,578
Speaker 1: well alright alright, but I've never been to a convention that did that.

311
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:58,180
Speaker 1: okay I'm just saying of all the things I have gone to all the professional conferences all the anime things all the video game everything Otakon's weight is pretty much zero unless you were dumb and choose to wait in line.

312
00:20:59,262 --> 00:21:00,387
Speaker 1: But we don't have to talk about that.

313
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:00,789
Speaker 1: anyway.

314
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:10,848
Speaker 1: the deal here is that anime Boston There's a lot of claims as to what happened something like they're saying oh well the convention center Yeah, all everything we're gonna say about anime Boston.

315
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:11,089
Speaker 0: remember.

316
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:11,911
Speaker 0: We weren't there.

317
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:14,700
Speaker 0: We didn't talk to anyone directly who was there.

318
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:16,459
Speaker 0: We didn't talk to anyone who ran it.

319
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:21,215
Speaker 0: We're going completely by text on the internet in forums and websites that are reporting.

320
00:21:21,276 --> 00:21:22,620
Speaker 0: so that's you know.

321
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,165
Speaker 0: It's just so.

322
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:27,949
Speaker 0: in case you say anything wrong We're like tertiary sources here, so don't blame us.

323
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:29,614
Speaker 0: so apparently we can get we can do.

324
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:36,920
Speaker 1: there were long long waits on Thursday for pre-registration, but apparently very few people use the Thursday compared to other cons.

325
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:48,616
Speaker 1: I mean I guess Otakon is kind of the exception where almost half of Otakon's attendees seem to show up like Midday on Thursday and stay until like five o'clock on Sunday, but that might just be the way Otakon is.

326
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:59,331
Speaker 1: but so Friday Basically the line was just crazy and a lot of people could not get in Friday period and Saturday the lines were still super super super bad.

327
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:00,254
Speaker 0: was anime Boston?

328
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:00,796
Speaker 0: was there red?

329
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:01,097
Speaker 0: how much?

330
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:01,940
Speaker 0: how much did they grow?

331
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,134
Speaker 1: Well apparently they had about 4,000 more people this year than last.

332
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:07,520
Speaker 0: that is a pretty significant jump.

333
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,130
Speaker 0: But their reg wasn't so terrible last year right?

334
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,880
Speaker 0: and a 4,000 people wall a significant jump.

335
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:20,206
Speaker 0: 4,000 people does not a nine-hour line mate right even if their reg last year was like You know a two-hour wait.

336
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,740
Speaker 0: right a 4,000 extra people would most double.

337
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:25,500
Speaker 0: It's like a three or four hour wait.

338
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,167
Speaker 0: And that would be if they really sucked.

339
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:37,059
Speaker 0: so even if they didn't modify their registration system at all They would have been just fine this year, and I guess well It would have been just fine, but they wouldn't have been as this bad, so what did they fuck up?

340
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,662
Speaker 1: Well here is the official statement from Jackie Elion.

341
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:46,633
Speaker 1: we love Archie anime Boston 2008 director of registration.

342
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:51,252
Speaker 1: also the Providence anime conference 2008 registration manager.

343
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:58,056
Speaker 1: oh see We Have a lot to say about the Providence anime conference.

344
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:58,680
Speaker 0: I have to wait.

345
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:01,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're only going to go if we're press.

346
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:08,434
Speaker 1: if we're if I have to pay to go I'm not gonna go especially after this because I don't trust Jackie Elion way Love Archie or lavash.

347
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,160
Speaker 1: I don't know how to pronounce it.

348
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,699
Speaker 1: I don't know this person don't even know what this person looks like.

349
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:18,399
Speaker 1: But this is the person could be some hot person to whom the buck has been passed quotes to address your points.

350
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,140
Speaker 1: one Gone are the days that the reg division is overlooked.

351
00:23:22,582 --> 00:23:25,899
Speaker 1: I plan to restructure and double the amount of staff we have in the very least now.

352
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:33,794
Speaker 1: I would like to point out that according to what I heard Even if you quadrupled the number of staff it would not have helped.

353
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:35,059
Speaker 1: you had so few.

354
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:40,219
Speaker 1: Anyway moving on point two Unfortunately security suffered a real blow.

355
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,609
Speaker 1: 30% of their staff did not show up.

356
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,416
Speaker 1: They hired 60 and only 40 showed up.

357
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:55,678
Speaker 1: this forced us to use volunteers for a lot of line wrangling and Unfortunately people you pull from a crowd are never going to be as good as those hired to do a specific job like securities.

358
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:05,009
Speaker 1: now If this was all line regulation and security these people had almost no impact as far as I could imagine On how long it took to register people.

359
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,239
Speaker 1: so that doesn't really have anything to do with this.

360
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:12,556
Speaker 1: and uh three Unfortunately, no I'll get to what that's for.

361
00:24:13,342 --> 00:24:17,980
Speaker 1: We did what we could but if we offered any type of refund the con would cease to exist.

362
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:21,914
Speaker 1: The majority of the cons bills come after the convention and are paid by the at-con funds.

363
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,520
Speaker 1: We cannot possibly do this.

364
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,500
Speaker 1: I hope you understand and wish for anime boston to fix the problems rather than cease to exist now.

365
00:24:29,504 --> 00:24:43,340
Speaker 1: I don't want to sound like a jerk here but if I showed up to any convention that I had paid to to attend And I show up on the first day of the convention and discover that nine hours later will be the earliest I can have my badge.

366
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:48,580
Speaker 1: I'm going home and i'm demanding a refund and I probably paid with a credit card.

367
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,426
Speaker 1: So in the very least i'm charging back.

368
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:52,714
Speaker 0: Yeah at the very least charging back.

369
00:24:52,915 --> 00:24:54,280
Speaker 1: No, well pretty much I would have.

370
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:57,878
Speaker 0: I mean there is a case to be made like, you know, there is.

371
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:09,000
Speaker 0: you know You're going to have to expect to wait but then there's a reasonable expectation of waiting and nine hours For a con, you know, basically yes, there are events going all day.

372
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:15,753
Speaker 0: No, it is not possible to get your badge until the you know The day for which you have purchased to go to those events is over.

373
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:17,680
Speaker 0: That is an unreasonable expectation.

374
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:20,532
Speaker 1: So yeah now I don't know what's going to come.

375
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:25,280
Speaker 0: that's like if I bought baseball tickets And they weren't I wasn't going to be able to get to my seat until the ninth inning.

376
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,602
Speaker 0: Unreasonable.

377
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:26,903
Speaker 0: Yep.

378
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,952
Speaker 1: Now especially I mean with fan conventions.

379
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:30,860
Speaker 1: There is a certain extra amount of leeway.

380
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:44,214
Speaker 0: I give a convention a lot more leeway than I would give a professional for-profit organization Like if you show up at odicon on friday And you pre-reged and you get in by like one.

381
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:45,177
Speaker 0: that's okay.

382
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:46,060
Speaker 0: That's fine.

383
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,032
Speaker 0: I mean, that's the best but that's expected.

384
00:25:48,173 --> 00:26:02,369
Speaker 0: but seriously nine hours or more more than my entire working day as in If you have to stay in line so long All right that if you a reasonable here's my.

385
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:05,320
Speaker 0: you know what I just came up with scott's rules for a reasonable line weight.

386
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:11,460
Speaker 0: A reasonable line weight is a weight in line in which you will never have to take a break for peeing or food.

387
00:26:12,562 --> 00:26:19,114
Speaker 0: If you have to wait in line so long that you need to leave the line to pee Or poop or leave the line to eat a meal and come back to the line.

388
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:20,359
Speaker 0: That's an unreasonable line.

389
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,306
Speaker 1: But uh, it gets better.

390
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:25,493
Speaker 1: You want to know what caused this line.

391
00:26:25,553 --> 00:26:30,731
Speaker 0: This is my uh, putting together I've read all the computers that the reg people are using crash.

392
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:33,080
Speaker 0: They didn't have some sort of a backup system.

393
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:38,194
Speaker 1: So apparently this year they decided to go with a self-service registration system.

394
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:47,258
Speaker 1: Oh god now, okay I've read claims that the delays were due to the fact that people took longer to use this system than was expected.

395
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:51,950
Speaker 0: Well, well Now from being someone who used rides many trains that

396
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,555
Speaker 1: is that's a possibility

397
00:26:53,755 --> 00:27:05,340
Speaker 0: and the tickets for said trains Are sold by automatic machines and the level of incompetence I see people who are not used to those machines using them like if someone knows how to use a metro card machine.

398
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:10,644
Speaker 0: They're like doot doot doot doot doot and in like 15 to 30 seconds They've done their business.

399
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:19,620
Speaker 0: someone who doesn't know how to use one could be standing there for up to a minute or more Not knowing what to do And or going very slowly and reading everything very carefully.

400
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:29,414
Speaker 0: So for an automatic system at a convention registration where there's going to be a line You know each and every person comes up learns it does it.

401
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:31,280
Speaker 0: that's going to take forever.

402
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:37,858
Speaker 1: There's now there are ways to mitigate that and I could understand if they'd been a little bit off into how long it would Take for people to do it.

403
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:40,649
Speaker 1: But how many of these do you think they had?

404
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:40,910
Speaker 1: how many?

405
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,652
Speaker 1: well how many?

406
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:43,960
Speaker 0: how many people are waiting in line and one day?

407
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,891
Speaker 1: They quote estimates run as high as 15,000 paid attendees.

408
00:27:49,112 --> 00:27:51,860
Speaker 0: Okay, so 15,000 paid tenants, but they'd all didn't show up Friday.

409
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:52,950
Speaker 0: So let's give them some slack.

410
00:27:52,970 --> 00:28:02,391
Speaker 0: Let's say like 10,000. so 10,000 people we're gonna say if it takes one minute to To do the do the machine, right?

411
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:06,066
Speaker 0: It takes 10,000 machine minutes 10,000 machine minutes.

412
00:28:06,688 --> 00:28:15,294
Speaker 0: So if you had one machine it would take 166 hours with 10,000 people to do the whole thing, right?

413
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:15,736
Speaker 0: Is that right?

414
00:28:16,217 --> 00:28:17,260
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna do the math.

415
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:18,326
Speaker 0: I think that's about right.

416
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:20,960
Speaker 1: The thing is someone else did the math in a forum.

417
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:24,893
Speaker 0: I don't even have to bring it down to a reasonable two or three hours.

418
00:28:25,395 --> 00:28:29,809
Speaker 0: You would need like 50 more than 50 machines.

419
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:32,920
Speaker 1: now how many machines Scott do you think they had?

420
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,088
Speaker 1: Well judging by his reports differ.

421
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:53,669
Speaker 0: judging by the resources of a fan-run Anime convention and and because I already know that there were severe nine-hour waits a nine-hour wait I would peg it around 15 something machine for four machines Possibly five.

422
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,619
Speaker 1: I have heard both of those two numbers.

423
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:59,756
Speaker 0: now they even take into account like machine breakdown because I have no idea.

424
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:11,880
Speaker 1: but I Could not if that if it is true that they only had five machines Even if they only had ten machines double the numbers that I've seen reported.

425
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,572
Speaker 1: Like there's no way anyone could have thought that would have been adequate.

426
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:18,559
Speaker 1: There is no possible way.

427
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:18,780
Speaker 0: now.

428
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:28,903
Speaker 0: It could have been a situation in which you know They contracted out the machines to some company and the company showed up with like four machines when they ordered like a whole bunch We don't know.

429
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:35,086
Speaker 0: but even if that's the case you basically when you run a convention You need to you know have a plan.

430
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:40,251
Speaker 0: for what if everyone we're paying to do stuff just doesn't show up and they did not Have such a plan.

431
00:29:40,677 --> 00:29:50,455
Speaker 1: Yep I mean God the content the contingency plans we had it like katsu kon for if things went bad or if any trouble happened and Contingency plans that I am sure Otacon has and that sort of thing.

432
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:54,377
Speaker 1: It was I Have so much to say but here's what I would have done.

433
00:29:54,397 --> 00:30:06,095
Speaker 1: now again I don't know the full situation But if it was true that there is a very very long nine plus hour line and registration is a problem I would have gotten staffers together even had whoever I need.

434
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:16,880
Speaker 1: I would have gotten some people I would have gone to the line and I would have designated groups of people by color or something and I would have had a badge amnesty on Friday.

435
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:21,140
Speaker 1: Anyone can come in and I just have people at the doors making sure we don't violate the fire code.

436
00:30:21,512 --> 00:30:34,620
Speaker 1: Yep Now again this sort of thing might have been not possible due to the contract they signed But it sounds like they had a lot of problems with the contract They signed anyway in terms of using space in the Convention Center, which seems to be a common problem.

437
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:37,214
Speaker 1: I think Connecticut had a problem with their contract a few years.

438
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:49,798
Speaker 0: a lot of the fan-run Conventions have a problem and they don't fully read the Convention Center contract or they don't get a lawyer to look at it and they End up breaking some of the rules or violating something somewhere that they didn't realize.

439
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:51,285
Speaker 1: now I really don't want.

440
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:58,160
Speaker 0: it is why hotel cons are much easier because you don't have that you don't have as much bull You have bullshit, but hotels are a little more lax than the convention centers.

441
00:30:58,342 --> 00:31:04,180
Speaker 1: No, this is tricky for me because on one hand I don't want to be super down on anime Boston aside from not being there.

442
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,360
Speaker 1: It is a fat, you know fan-run conventions get a lot of slack.

443
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:15,198
Speaker 1: But at the same time I have to look at this from the perspective of an anime fan and had I gone and not been press or staff or anything I

444
00:31:17,023 --> 00:31:17,290
Speaker 0: Would

445
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:30,349
Speaker 1: have Basically gone to the front of the line after I discovered that there was basically no way I was gonna get in a reasonable amount Of time I would have demanded a refund for Friday and had they said no I would have charged back my credit card and gone home.

446
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,840
Speaker 1: Yep, or in the very least just not gone to the convention.

447
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:37,479
Speaker 1: Yep, or I might have even gone to the convention charge back my credit card.

448
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:37,800
Speaker 1: anyway.

449
00:31:38,821 --> 00:31:40,268
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things I would have done.

450
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:45,160
Speaker 1: I don't know how many people out there Know that you can charge back on a credit card.

451
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,268
Speaker 0: You can also do stop payment on a check.

452
00:31:47,308 --> 00:31:47,730
Speaker 0: you write.

453
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,854
Speaker 0: of course that cost money though.

454
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does which That's probably good.

455
00:31:52,060 --> 00:32:01,916
Speaker 0: Stop payment stop payment and charging back your credit card are very effective methods for when you are dissatisfied With service usually expensive service.

456
00:32:01,956 --> 00:32:12,112
Speaker 0: for example If you hire like a DJ or something and then for a party and then they suck You should charge them back and then they'll be like what the fuck.

457
00:32:12,152 --> 00:32:14,420
Speaker 0: and then you can be like, you know, you really sucked.

458
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:20,496
Speaker 0: We're gonna negotiate a lower price because you sucked and then you can really you know, push people around.

459
00:32:20,516 --> 00:32:22,160
Speaker 0: It's it's a good idea sometimes.

460
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:30,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, just don't you know don't get in trouble for stealing because that can happen to like, you know you buy HDTV and then charge it back and keep the TV.

461
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:32,227
Speaker 0: Yeah not gonna fly now.

462
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:45,514
Speaker 1: the fact that anime Boston is unable or unwilling to give refunds means one of two things either they're just unwilling to because it would be a substantial burden and but the thing is because they say that it would basically prevent anime Boston from continuing.

463
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:56,940
Speaker 1: either they're lying which I doubt or they do not have enough operating capital or contingency budget or even Credit to deal with that situation.

464
00:32:57,003 --> 00:33:06,960
Speaker 1: Yeah that also more importantly that means that regardless of like How many people are reported to have been caught up in this mess if the number of people?

465
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:16,659
Speaker 1: Caught up in this mess to the point that all of them demanding refunds would bankrupt anime Boston That means a lot of people were caught up in this mess and that is inexcusable.

466
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,290
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean think about this right if That I mean a lot of fan-run conventions.

467
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:31,180
Speaker 0: if you don't have just a pile of money like, you know Enough to run the convention already Then you're basically taking all the reg money then using all the reg money to pay for the con and you're breaking.

468
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,220
Speaker 0: You know, you're sort of breaking even and always have an empty bank.

469
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:34,481
Speaker 0: what

470
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:50,140
Speaker 1: you've got to do in that case is have in some sort of insurance policy be it and in a negotiated insurance policy that'll cover a contingency like that or Like guaranteed credit based on future revenues some sort of backup plan

471
00:33:50,381 --> 00:34:03,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you're just doing it that way and refunds will kill the con well, I mean think about this right you can either give refunds and kill the con or There'll be some sort of class-action lawsuit and kill the con.

472
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:13,164
Speaker 0: It's basically they killed their own con and the thing that's sad about it Right is the part that makes me, you know, because on the one hand is like fuck anime Boston They suck.

473
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,199
Speaker 0: but on the other hand to think about this, right?

474
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:20,918
Speaker 0: The reg people are really the ones who suck and of course I guess the responsibility for that goes all the way to the con chair.

475
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:24,312
Speaker 0: But think about say the person running panels in anime Boston.

476
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:27,322
Speaker 0: They might have been running the best damn panels You have no idea.

477
00:34:27,643 --> 00:34:34,139
Speaker 0: but that now their cons gonna die because someone else, you know that something they're not responsible for was the suck.

478
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:37,753
Speaker 0: And that's you know, what if the video rooms are great and such?

479
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:39,699
Speaker 0: it's like oh, oh you got it.

480
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,139
Speaker 0: You know that part is kind of sad Yeah.

481
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:48,135
Speaker 1: But I still and I think you would do the same thing and if I were in the situation Charged-backs are coming.

482
00:34:48,297 --> 00:35:03,667
Speaker 1: Yeah but I got to address something too because While a lot of people are complaining about this legitimately some people You know these people I saw one woman complaining that her son had an asthma attack in line And oh, that's not the kind.

483
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,013
Speaker 0: you can't blame the con for that.

484
00:35:05,415 --> 00:35:07,665
Speaker 1: and more importantly I'm not.

485
00:35:07,785 --> 00:35:10,839
Speaker 1: I'm gonna paraphrase here, but I was looking at the quote a little while ago.

486
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:14,753
Speaker 1: What they should have done is kept the pillows concert secret.

487
00:35:15,134 --> 00:35:18,770
Speaker 1: people shouldn't have come to this con Just to see that stupid rock band.

488
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,840
Speaker 1: They should have come to the con for the love of anime.

489
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,249
Speaker 1: Pillows is the reason we had these problems.

490
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:23,972
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

491
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:24,494
Speaker 0: Thank you.

492
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:25,740
Speaker 0: Daryl Surratt's friend.

493
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:27,809
Speaker 1: I believe it's Daryl Surratt.

494
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,380
Speaker 0: It could be but yeah, that guy needs to shut up.

495
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,707
Speaker 0: It's like yes, there was.

496
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:33,678
Speaker 0: there are valid things to complain about.

497
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:36,539
Speaker 0: Yes That doesn't mean that every complaint you have is valid.

498
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,189
Speaker 1: I just in the end.

499
00:35:38,229 --> 00:35:39,798
Speaker 1: I if nothing else.

500
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:49,428
Speaker 1: if What I'm looking at now from the anime news network is the extent of the formal statement from the con about this I'm not impressed at all.

501
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:55,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, glad I didn't go to anime Boston and I mean, I don't see myself going to it in the near future?

502
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,129
Speaker 1: Definitely not.

503
00:35:57,149 --> 00:35:58,079
Speaker 0: does it mean, you know?

504
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:04,947
Speaker 0: Well, I had a pillows concert which is something to see but it doesn't really seem like anime Boston has something to offer that.

505
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,540
Speaker 1: oh, I was going through this quickly.

506
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,914
Speaker 1: I'm now looking at the full statement, which is actually much longer.

507
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:11,536
Speaker 0: Okay.

508
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:12,500
Speaker 0: Do you got any good bits in there?

509
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:12,782
Speaker 0: Let's see.

510
00:36:12,823 --> 00:36:13,871
Speaker 1: My name is Jacquelyn Lavache.

511
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:14,396
Speaker 1: I'm the director.

512
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:14,920
Speaker 1: blah blah blah.

513
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,016
Speaker 1: I would like to address the issue of registration wait times this year.

514
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:20,450
Speaker 1: first and foremost I sincerely apologize for the five plus wait times experience.

515
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:23,040
Speaker 0: Apologies doesn't fill my wallet and give me my nine hours back.

516
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,320
Speaker 1: There are many factors that caused this to problem this problem.

517
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:29,680
Speaker 1: These included the lack of sufficient staff which was more than last year, but still not enough.

518
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:38,480
Speaker 1: We also wrote an entire new database that was created to make it more functional and user-friendly Allowing people options like changing their badge name and seeing the status of the registration for the convention.

519
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,564
Speaker 1: yet There's still kinks that worked out.

520
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:41,412
Speaker 1: main issue with the self-service kiosk.

521
00:36:41,593 --> 00:36:46,794
Speaker 1: after taking feedback from the previous year We tried a new process of registration that we thought would help spade blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

522
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:48,240
Speaker 1: This was not the case.

523
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:50,780
Speaker 1: We became aware of the problem.

524
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,456
Speaker 1: We immediately began to rearrange the room as best we could to process registrations.

525
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:57,005
Speaker 1: with permission of the Hines We opened the back door redirected the line.

526
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:58,992
Speaker 1: blah blah blah blah blah wasn't enough.

527
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:00,536
Speaker 1: We did our best didn't work.

528
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:05,970
Speaker 1: after we closed We did an immediate Reconfiguration again did helped but not enough.

529
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:08,560
Speaker 1: I promise you will fix it next year and we learned a lot.

530
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:11,420
Speaker 1: I'd like to thank all the staffers who made this possible.

531
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:14,429
Speaker 1: I was like to thank the Convention Center for making helping us out.

532
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:21,397
Speaker 1: last like they encourage anyone who has feedback to contact me Send him links to this episode.

533
00:37:23,943 --> 00:37:26,840
Speaker 1: People yeah, also if anyone was there I want to hear some first-hand accounts.

534
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:28,286
Speaker 0: I definitely want to hear the first time.

535
00:37:28,306 --> 00:37:33,326
Speaker 0: I want to hear exactly what went down from people who are more reliable than Pillows hating guy in the forum.

536
00:37:33,426 --> 00:37:37,240
Speaker 1: Yes, and also written Scott who are reading the forum where pillows hating guy posted.

537
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:38,989
Speaker 0: All right before we do things of the day.

538
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:40,316
Speaker 0: I was reminded of one thing.

539
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:43,143
Speaker 0: I wanted to say We've gotten.

540
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:46,252
Speaker 0: you might recall we're doing a contest for some books.

541
00:37:46,713 --> 00:37:47,094
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

542
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:55,821
Speaker 0: I forgot to mention last week and So far we've gotten two entries one of which was fail and one of which I have to double-check just to make sure it's not Fail.

543
00:37:56,082 --> 00:38:01,677
Speaker 1: however, even if it fails due to some technicality it is definitely win in terms of content.

544
00:38:01,757 --> 00:38:11,775
Speaker 0: I think it is so if you want the entire Guin saga manga published by vertical which I've talked about on the show before.

545
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:13,100
Speaker 0: it's a good manga.

546
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:16,129
Speaker 0: It's not the greatest manga ever, but it's it's high quality.

547
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,892
Speaker 0: It's worth owning.

548
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:19,480
Speaker 0: It's a fantasy manga, which is rare to come by.

549
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,418
Speaker 0: I mean a good fantasy manga is worth something if you like fantasy because there's not a lot of them.

550
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:29,339
Speaker 0: All you have to do is write an essay about why we should give it to you for free.

Speaker 1: Give it to me.

00:39:05,837 --> 00:39:19,179

560
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:23,100
Speaker 0: It's your free manga in exchange for typing.

561
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:28,940
Speaker 0: This is probably if I not get if I don't get any more entries because so far they've been two entries.

562
00:39:29,341 --> 00:39:30,646
Speaker 0: So I don't get any entries soon.

563
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,052
Speaker 0: I think by next week.

564
00:39:32,092 --> 00:39:33,899
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna mail it out cuz.

565
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:39,739
Speaker 1: yeah Why didn't anime Boston just go halfway down the line and tell those people to come back later?

566
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,803
Speaker 0: because they're dumb They're well cuz.

567
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:44,305
Speaker 0: think about it.

568
00:39:44,346 --> 00:39:50,575
Speaker 0: if they did that it would have been like a New York Comic Con situation of you know People are standing outside then someone comes out and says go home.

569
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:51,239
Speaker 0: You're not getting in.

570
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:52,520
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

571
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,684
Speaker 1: you know what else you could have done.

572
00:39:54,105 --> 00:40:02,560
Speaker 1: could have gotten a bunch of people and printed out a bunch of numbers and given people Numbers and said come back and then we'll get back in line with these numbers after we sort this business out.

573
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, good.

574
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,840
Speaker 0: Uh, there's a they could have done something they didn't, you know improvise with the wellness.

575
00:40:08,203 --> 00:40:10,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right enough ragging on anime Boston.

576
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:20,060
Speaker 1: After 40 minutes of that it's time for things of the day.

577
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,424
Speaker 0: really 40 minutes almost.

578
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:23,512
Speaker 0: Okay things that a real quick All right.

579
00:40:23,532 --> 00:40:24,094
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

580
00:40:24,616 --> 00:40:28,770
Speaker 0: So this is website that's actually been getting pretty popular lately called bit strips calm.

581
00:40:29,714 --> 00:40:30,929
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good website.

582
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:38,235
Speaker 0: Basically what you do is if you have no artistic skills whatsoever like me you make comics but you don't have to draw.

583
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:41,227
Speaker 0: you just have to type and make characters and drag them around.

584
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:45,228
Speaker 0: and People are making a lot of funny comics on here including me.

585
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:48,017
Speaker 0: It's everyone come and make comics.

586
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:50,445
Speaker 1: We'll make some sort of forum thread dedicated.

587
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:52,250
Speaker 0: There is a forum thread dedicated to it.

588
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,138
Speaker 1: Well, I'll link to that.

589
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:53,603
Speaker 0: Yeah.

590
00:40:53,987 --> 00:40:54,289
Speaker 1: All right.

591
00:40:54,531 --> 00:41:00,690
Speaker 1: So I'm catching up on a lot of animes suddenly on the train and right now I'm watching bokurano, which is fantastic.

592
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,199
Speaker 1: We reviewed it briefly a while ago.

593
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:03,265
Speaker 1: Once I finish it.

594
00:41:03,285 --> 00:41:04,070
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give it to Scott.

595
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,809
Speaker 1: He's gonna watch it all and then we're gonna do some sort of full-on review.

596
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:08,658
Speaker 1: It's a really good show.

597
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,590
Speaker 1: But my thing of the day is very simple.

598
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:14,870
Speaker 1: It's a YouTube video that includes a piano rendition of the opening theme.

599
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,132
Speaker 1: That's it.

600
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:19,082
Speaker 1: No, the opening theme is a really really really good song.

601
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,286
Speaker 0: That's that uninstall song.

602
00:41:20,306 --> 00:41:20,587
Speaker 0: Yes.

603
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:21,430
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good song.

604
00:41:21,735 --> 00:41:22,083
Speaker 0: I like it.

605
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,880
Speaker 1: Well, it's the nice thing the thing about bokurano and what.

606
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:33,210
Speaker 1: the reason I picked this thing today is that it seems like you can Almost always tell if a show is worth watching by the opener and a lot of the times you can it is for anime.

607
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,366
Speaker 1: Like there's certain things that are common in openers for good shows.

608
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:43,432
Speaker 0: Well, let's see Japanese j-rock or j-pop Opener.

609
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:46,683
Speaker 0: this show cost a lot of money and will probably be very popular.

610
00:41:46,723 --> 00:41:48,570
Speaker 1: an opener that was written for the show.

611
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:51,076
Speaker 1: This show has the backing of people who care.

612
00:41:51,096 --> 00:41:53,041
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can pretty much.

613
00:41:53,122 --> 00:42:01,802
Speaker 0: you know opener that has a dance, you know You can really tell a whole lot about an anime show from the opener once you know anime.

614
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:06,779
Speaker 1: generic j-rock opener generic show Yep, but anyway, that's all I got.

615
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,873
Speaker 1: So moving on tonight last night We were trying.

616
00:42:09,913 --> 00:42:12,890
Speaker 1: we tried to watch ghetto Sankey, but we ran into some trouble and it was late.

617
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,870
Speaker 1: So in the said we watched some anime.

618
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:21,750
Speaker 0: So instead of the studio Ghibli we watched two completely random episodes of some animes.

619
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:22,813
Speaker 0: We're random.

620
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:26,323
Speaker 1: luckily, I will probably go short on this because this turned into the oh my god.

621
00:42:26,404 --> 00:42:27,667
Speaker 1: anime Boston episode.

622
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:28,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fun.

623
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:30,839
Speaker 0: So you want which one you want to do first?

624
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,390
Speaker 1: I think we should talk about Nightwizard the animation.

625
00:42:33,571 --> 00:42:37,450
Speaker 0: All right, so we watched episode 1 of Nightwizard the animation.

626
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:44,362
Speaker 0: This is actually a show an episode that we had watched a long time ago But where you rewatched it to sort of refresh the memory.

627
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:46,570
Speaker 0: as to what was the deal with this show?

628
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:53,041
Speaker 0: Basically, it's one of those Feel good Scream and shout anime club shows.

629
00:42:53,062 --> 00:42:57,283
Speaker 0: That's not so great to watch on your own But with friends it can be a good good old time.

630
00:42:57,424 --> 00:42:57,685
Speaker 0: Yes.

631
00:42:57,725 --> 00:43:04,210
Speaker 1: It's nothing spectacular If you run an anime club show the first episode of this to your club.

632
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:13,430
Speaker 0: Good God, I cannot stress that enough But if you're looking for some highbrow kind of you know anime for the ages you want to wait for the next show.

633
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:13,909
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk.

634
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:16,216
Speaker 0: This is not your department.

635
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:20,733
Speaker 1: what frightens me is the absolutely high ratings the show has gotten on the anime news network Really?

636
00:43:20,854 --> 00:43:21,256
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

637
00:43:21,276 --> 00:43:23,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, those are those are a pretty above average ratings.

638
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:30,130
Speaker 1: Yeah The thing is I would actually have rated the show kind of highly because I know it's the kind of thing that Dave Riley hates.

639
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,722
Speaker 1: It's one of those wacky anime comedies.

640
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:33,285
Speaker 0: I don't know.

641
00:43:33,325 --> 00:43:38,329
Speaker 0: I'd give this like Seven out of ten this show if it didn't have six and a half.

642
00:43:39,092 --> 00:43:44,788
Speaker 1: It's got this problem where it's one of those zany crazy funny because it's just so stupid.

643
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:54,108
Speaker 1: but yet You know well-constructed shows but tacked on to that is an actual takes itself seriously plot that Totally just doesn't fit.

644
00:43:54,910 --> 00:44:00,170
Speaker 0: Basically, the story is it seems like there's a normal world and some sort of monster world, right?

645
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:06,980
Speaker 0: And they sort of interact and they don't really tell you much about it except there There are some kids who have to fight the monsters of course.

646
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:09,408
Speaker 1: and the main character is I'm pretty easy.

647
00:44:09,428 --> 00:44:13,060
Speaker 0: in the main character Cuz he gets about equal screen time with some other characters.

648
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,709
Speaker 1: I think he's the character who's supposed to identify with I guess.

649
00:44:16,813 --> 00:44:22,450
Speaker 1: But Renji is a kid and all he wants is to get to goddamn school.

650
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,821
Speaker 1: But instead no this woman comes up and says woman.

651
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:30,221
Speaker 0: She's like 12 years old find this, but she looks love She's a wizard or something.

652
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:30,623
Speaker 1: She's probably.

653
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:31,530
Speaker 0: she's in charge.

654
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:32,053
Speaker 0: She's sort of.

655
00:44:32,355 --> 00:44:38,049
Speaker 0: there's one girl who's in charge of like the good Wizard types and there's another girl who seems to be in charge of the evil.

656
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:52,870
Speaker 0: yeah, basically It seems sort of like a harem show because this is the one guy who wants to get to school and all the other characters are Like the childhood friend who's a girl the the shy new girl who's you know friends with the childhood friend girl?

657
00:44:53,850 --> 00:45:07,228
Speaker 0: the quiet girl with the gun who helps fight the monsters the evil in charge of the monsters girl and The kind of bitchy Annoying in charge of the good guys girl, so it's a bunch of girls in a guy.

658
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:13,790
Speaker 1: now The show has a lot of very kind of cliche, but cliche within the context of the show like tropes.

659
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,821
Speaker 1: I mean There's this basically the head girl of his night.

660
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:26,942
Speaker 1: wizards will grab the guy Usually while he's on his way to school or while he's on his way back from the last mission on Trying to get to school again and say pretty much alright.

661
00:45:26,962 --> 00:45:29,190
Speaker 1: I'm gonna send you to probably die in this horrible fight.

662
00:45:29,714 --> 00:45:31,245
Speaker 1: Are you gonna respond with okay, or?

663
00:45:32,591 --> 00:45:33,233
Speaker 0: Yes, she's like.

664
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:34,718
Speaker 0: she's like you guys.

665
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:36,202
Speaker 0: I'm offering you this mission.

666
00:45:36,242 --> 00:45:38,489
Speaker 0: You can replace ply with okay, or yes.

667
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:44,110
Speaker 1: now This is obviously one of those really really forced jokes, but I found myself cracking up at it the third time.

668
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:44,780
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

669
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:44,821
Speaker 1: I

670
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:55,972
Speaker 0: don't know I laughed at it the first time because I remembered it you know cuz I remember like oh, yeah This is the okay, or yes show ha ha ha ha, but then every other time they tell the okay, or yes joke It's like yeah,

671
00:45:56,073 --> 00:45:56,996
Speaker 1: so what are these missions?

672
00:45:57,177 --> 00:46:07,849
Speaker 1: This is when it goes from a kid in the modern world walk into school He's pulled into space onto Mars, and now he's fighting skeletons that are dressed up like clowns with a sword.

673
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:14,949
Speaker 1: and This is when we see the absolute best part of this entire series not this episode the whole series.

674
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:17,400
Speaker 0: He's even though you've only ever seen the first episode.

675
00:46:17,982 --> 00:46:26,870
Speaker 1: He's thrown onto Mars right and He lands on top of all the a bunch of these skeletons and the one skeleton directly behind the skeleton he fell on.

676
00:46:28,072 --> 00:46:30,570
Speaker 1: Does the skeleton equivalent of raising an eyebrow?

677
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:33,336
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that alone.

678
00:46:33,356 --> 00:46:35,021
Speaker 1: What makes this show worth it?

679
00:46:35,382 --> 00:46:43,589
Speaker 1: that one second of screen time Partly cuz it reminds me of a character Scott played in an old D&D game a long time ago.

680
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,001
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought the best part was the second mission.

681
00:46:46,021 --> 00:46:46,664
Speaker 0: They send him on.

682
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:50,079
Speaker 0: he has to fight like these midget No-mo, and he goes to eat lunch right.

683
00:46:50,179 --> 00:47:00,620
Speaker 0: so then he finally beats up all the no monsters And they're only like nine of them, and he so he sits down He breaks out this bento, and he's eating it, and he's like ah finally I can't get to school But I can eat my lunch.

684
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:11,094
Speaker 0: and he's sitting on Mars Around with all these dead monsters and he breaks out his lunch and a monster You know sort of gets up and sort of creeps up behind him, and he just sort of backfists it And he's like fuck you.

685
00:47:11,114 --> 00:47:11,837
Speaker 0: I'm eating lunch.

686
00:47:12,138 --> 00:47:12,680
Speaker 1: God damn it.

687
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:13,985
Speaker 1: I love the backfist.

688
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:16,655
Speaker 1: It's so used in anime I mean hokudono can.

689
00:47:16,675 --> 00:47:18,322
Speaker 1: there's like one backfist per episode.

690
00:47:18,462 --> 00:47:20,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't know what it is about the backfist.

691
00:47:20,517 --> 00:47:22,932
Speaker 0: I don't know There's something about that not Looking.

692
00:47:23,253 --> 00:47:28,693
Speaker 0: someone comes up behind you and you just sort of hit him with the back of your fist and right in the face and They go down.

693
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:29,698
Speaker 0: That's that's so cool.

694
00:47:29,758 --> 00:47:31,748
Speaker 0: It feels like it works every time even though.

695
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:32,190
Speaker 0: It's cliche.

696
00:47:32,674 --> 00:47:36,748
Speaker 1: You know how I know I know how that really works though You know we learn this in kung kung fu.

697
00:47:37,011 --> 00:47:37,724
Speaker 1: So this is what you do.

698
00:47:38,472 --> 00:47:56,428
Speaker 1: If ever you're like if you know in your life that at some point people are gonna sneak up on you What you do is you train the kung fu so you can do all those different kinds of punches Especially that back fist punch and every five minutes you just back fist punch Whether or not there's anything there and hopefully whenever someone's sneaking up on you one day.

699
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:56,890
Speaker 1: You'll get him.

700
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,399
Speaker 1: No, no, but that's what I imagine.

701
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,083
Speaker 0: Okay.

702
00:48:01,143 --> 00:48:02,670
Speaker 1: You might notice that I didn't pay attention.

703
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,663
Speaker 0: Yeah, and like if you back fist punch if no one's there.

704
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:19,607
Speaker 0: You just sort of raise your hand and y'all And then you hit you break someone's face by accident you run away.

705
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:24,886
Speaker 1: actually I think an honorable mention for good scenes in this episode is when they play the crane game with the kid.

706
00:48:24,906 --> 00:48:28,582
Speaker 1: I Don't remember that they pull him up with that hook from the sky.

707
00:48:28,602 --> 00:48:35,570
Speaker 1: All right, right, right Yeah, but then the whole second half of this episode has some sort of serious crap plot about a girl.

708
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:38,018
Speaker 1: It's totally the girls dead in that thing.

709
00:48:38,038 --> 00:48:40,427
Speaker 1: I don't even want to bother talking about it.

710
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:41,270
Speaker 1: The tree comes back.

711
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:47,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, that one of the shy girl discovers that she's like a night wizard too and then fighting a tree.

712
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,435
Speaker 0: I can't get over the title.

713
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:51,323
Speaker 0: That has a generic multi-beast in it.

714
00:48:51,484 --> 00:48:55,778
Speaker 0: Ah the multi-beast Yeah, we're arguing like is it really a chimera?

715
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:59,026
Speaker 0: Is it really lion lizard and the correct combination?

716
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:00,370
Speaker 1: It's some kind of multi-beast.

717
00:49:00,451 --> 00:49:02,408
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, it's some generic multi-beast.

718
00:49:03,952 --> 00:49:05,523
Speaker 0: I'm like, I really like the word multi-beast.

719
00:49:05,564 --> 00:49:06,430
Speaker 0: I'm glad I came up with it.

720
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:09,466
Speaker 1: What I really like though is that they're like, oh, it's the tree.

721
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:10,170
Speaker 1: blah blah blah.

722
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:14,210
Speaker 1: You should confess your love to the person you're like under this tree and then good things will happen.

723
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,202
Speaker 0: Like and it's like this horrible ugly tree with nothing growing on it.

724
00:49:17,242 --> 00:49:20,154
Speaker 1: that's been like gnarled in there for centuries Like it's the.

725
00:49:20,235 --> 00:49:23,770
Speaker 1: it looks exactly like the evil tree that tries to eat the kid in poltergeist.

726
00:49:23,951 --> 00:49:31,205
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then suddenly as they go to the evil world and the multi-beast comes out suddenly It's a beautiful cherry blossom tree like the biggest one in the ever seen.

727
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:33,695
Speaker 0: it's like, okay So in the evil world things are nicer.

728
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:38,470
Speaker 0: Okay, and then it kills the multi-beast and the tree gets ugly again.

729
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,561
Speaker 0: It's like wait, aren't you supposed to kill the multi-beast?

730
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:41,486
Speaker 0: and then the tree gets pretty.

731
00:49:41,526 --> 00:49:42,350
Speaker 0: it's totally backwards.

732
00:49:42,674 --> 00:49:46,117
Speaker 1: Maybe these are the bad guys But just the title I don't know.

733
00:49:46,538 --> 00:49:48,725
Speaker 1: night wizard does not sound like a good show.

734
00:49:48,805 --> 00:49:48,926
Speaker 1: all.

735
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:54,190
Speaker 1: if anything whenever I hear Night wizard all I can think is I put on my robe and wizard hat.

736
00:49:54,232 --> 00:50:02,410
Speaker 0: Yeah So if you're looking for 15 minutes of you know Laughing it up with your and already your friends who are already anime fans and already know anime cliches.

737
00:50:02,872 --> 00:50:03,815
Speaker 0: Or you have an anime club.

738
00:50:04,137 --> 00:50:06,185
Speaker 0: you can watch this first episode and get some yucks.

739
00:50:06,627 --> 00:50:07,470
Speaker 0: I would not recommend.

740
00:50:08,194 --> 00:50:21,723
Speaker 0: Like watching this whole show for as like a serious Yes is the best show ever kind of deal because I think there's gonna be some harem elements and some Elements really lean a little bit toward lesbians a little bit.

741
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:23,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's hard to tell without more episodes.

742
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:26,959
Speaker 1: It's not nearly as sexually charged as Bocorano though.

743
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:29,025
Speaker 0: It's only a 13 episode show apparently.

744
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:31,893
Speaker 0: So if you're bored, hey You know what.

745
00:50:31,913 --> 00:50:36,010
Speaker 1: though if you're that bored I can name a hundred shows you should watch before that.

746
00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:39,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, the animation in the show is average.

747
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:41,813
Speaker 1: yeah, it's that standard Computery.

748
00:50:41,973 --> 00:50:45,885
Speaker 1: well done Chris modern bad standard modern anime.

749
00:50:46,146 --> 00:50:46,446
Speaker 0: Okay.

Speaker 0: What's the other show we're talking about?

751
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:55,210
Speaker 1: Well the other show we debated Watching the show almost as long as it took to actually watch the show based on the name alone.

752
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:58,523
Speaker 1: Yes, because we knew this was gonna be bad going into it.

753
00:50:58,885 --> 00:51:00,170
Speaker 0: It's a show from 2000.

754
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,682
Speaker 0: Well night wizard is from 2007 the end of last year.

755
00:51:02,702 --> 00:51:05,132
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, yeah Almost forgot.

756
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:11,209
Speaker 1: night wizard was directed by the eminent Yusuke Yamamoto who is famous for fuck all.

757
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:11,750
Speaker 1: anyway.

758
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:23,816
Speaker 0: Okay This show we're about to talk about is from like the end of 2000 and early 2001 and it's a 20 episode show.

759
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:25,702
Speaker 0: I guess I'm not sure.

760
00:51:26,164 --> 00:51:30,984
Speaker 0: that's what anime news network says and The setting of this show is actually really awesome.

761
00:51:31,024 --> 00:51:41,980
Speaker 0: It takes place in 1947 Shinjuku and it's actually pretty cool because you know it really takes the historical Context into account and I like that.

762
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:43,547
Speaker 0: It's the rest of the show.

763
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:44,089
Speaker 0: That's the problem.

764
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:46,214
Speaker 1: Well, you know to be fair.

765
00:51:46,254 --> 00:51:47,037
Speaker 1: I just got to go back.

766
00:51:47,378 --> 00:51:53,277
Speaker 1: He did do welcome to the NHK and sergeant frog, okay But anyway, I just that's my thing.

767
00:51:53,297 --> 00:51:56,592
Speaker 1: I like to say famous for fuck all whenever I don't recognize a director All right.

768
00:51:56,673 --> 00:52:09,196
Speaker 0: Anyway, yes the show we're also we're about to talk about now is Directed by Nobutaka Nishizawa who I'm pretty sure is not the niche because I remember there was I I discussed this with you know Gerald and people in the know.

769
00:52:09,758 --> 00:52:10,641
Speaker 0: there's the niche.

770
00:52:10,942 --> 00:52:18,307
Speaker 0: who's actually some other niches our and This niche is actually a different niche and this is not a bad niche.

771
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:24,469
Speaker 0: I mean Nobutaka Nishizawa was the chief director of the Galaxy Express TV show.

772
00:52:25,635 --> 00:52:28,409
Speaker 0: Was the series director of a Dragon Quest show?

773
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:31,238
Speaker 0: Was did the Patiliro remember this?

774
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:33,445
Speaker 0: last time they came up is when we did the Patiliro.

775
00:52:33,886 --> 00:52:35,130
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah that show.

776
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:40,896
Speaker 0: yeah, so that's that's this director that we're talking about here and The show that we're gonna talk about.

777
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:42,562
Speaker 0: All right based on the name alone.

778
00:52:42,603 --> 00:52:44,109
Speaker 0: It's gonna tell you everything you need to know.

779
00:52:45,113 --> 00:52:48,249
Speaker 0: The name of this show is legendary gambler Tetsuya.

780
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:51,756
Speaker 1: Now you might remember our review of Akagi.

781
00:52:51,776 --> 00:53:00,458
Speaker 1: I Orders of magnitude worse than the show.

782
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,190
Speaker 1: the show has a tiny bit of entertainment value.

783
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:08,804
Speaker 1: Akagi had one good moment ever and that moment was very simply.

784
00:53:08,824 --> 00:53:10,108
Speaker 1: How's he gonna do it?

785
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:10,910
Speaker 1: How's he gonna do it?

786
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:11,371
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

787
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:20,122
Speaker 0: Well, I think Akagi also concentrated mostly on the mahjong whereas legendary gambler Tetsuya while there's it's it does concentrate quite a bit on the mahjong.

788
00:53:20,606 --> 00:53:28,971
Speaker 0: there is Also, mostly the gam the gambling and the you know characters and the setting does take some Effect.

789
00:53:29,593 --> 00:53:32,442
Speaker 1: but in Akagi, it's like how's he gonna do it?

790
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,930
Speaker 1: mahjong is a game of almost complete chance.

791
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:37,963
Speaker 1: It's it's not a test of skill or anything.

792
00:53:37,983 --> 00:53:42,643
Speaker 1: Oh my god How are they gonna make this dramatic and then he just fucking cheats?

793
00:53:43,085 --> 00:53:44,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least that made sense.

794
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,796
Speaker 0: It's like well, there's no way to add.

795
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:47,162
Speaker 0: How's he gonna win without eating?

796
00:53:47,322 --> 00:53:52,543
Speaker 1: This show is also about mahjong and How do you think they handle the tense situation?

797
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:53,850
Speaker 1: How do you think they they do it?

798
00:53:54,150 --> 00:54:02,522
Speaker 0: Well, they pretty much use all of these cinematic and animation techniques that were perfected in initial D and they multiply them by a thousand.

799
00:54:02,562 --> 00:54:03,785
Speaker 1: the music starts playing.

800
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:09,762
Speaker 1: the guy across the table has the Aura, I mean he throws down the piece like for BAM ladies.

801
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:10,625
Speaker 0: Yeah.

802
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:10,725
Speaker 0: Yeah.

803
00:54:10,946 --> 00:54:16,981
Speaker 0: Yeah You can really say about the show other than it's.

804
00:54:17,483 --> 00:54:19,628
Speaker 1: I got crack five five crack.

805
00:54:19,668 --> 00:54:20,129
Speaker 1: I've crack.

806
00:54:20,189 --> 00:54:21,895
Speaker 1: I don't know I'm not an old Jewish lady now.

807
00:54:22,356 --> 00:54:26,630
Speaker 0: Yeah for people who don't know mahjong is an ancient Chinese tile game.

808
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:30,357
Speaker 0: That's very similar to gin rummy In the way it is played played

809
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:31,844
Speaker 1: by three groups of people,

810
00:54:32,045 --> 00:54:46,233
Speaker 0: but it's also played by old Jewish ladies in the United States and they sort of play a different version of the game in a way and It's you know, it's played with the same set of tiles, but it's a very different game But it's still.

811
00:54:46,253 --> 00:54:47,960
Speaker 0: it's not a very it's a somewhat different game.

812
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,710
Speaker 0: just to give you some you know knowledge background.

813
00:54:50,811 --> 00:54:52,218
Speaker 1: So what happens in this show?

814
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:58,530
Speaker 0: someone cheats, oh, okay Well, I think it was just really experts late of hand and still cheating.

815
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:04,195
Speaker 0: The other thing is that in Akagi they were showing you the like the cheating technique and this one is like No way.

816
00:55:04,256 --> 00:55:05,785
Speaker 0: that tile was like under the table.

817
00:55:05,805 --> 00:55:06,650
Speaker 0: how the hell that happened.

818
00:55:06,812 --> 00:55:10,711
Speaker 1: But there was one really good scene and you know The show does remind me a lot of initial D Like.

819
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:10,891
Speaker 1: there's.

820
00:55:11,132 --> 00:55:15,286
Speaker 1: there's a character who's kind of like bunta and there's a character who's got like they kind of.

821
00:55:15,727 --> 00:55:20,990
Speaker 1: they set up the same Thing and there's the old differences that the main character loses right away.

822
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:24,906
Speaker 1: But the old master like this is set by the way at the end of World War two.

823
00:55:25,007 --> 00:55:25,750
Speaker 0: I told him that already.

824
00:55:25,811 --> 00:55:33,328
Speaker 1: Yes, so well This is important because there's a scene where they're all playing their illegal mahjong and then that was.

825
00:55:33,368 --> 00:55:34,230
Speaker 0: that was the good scene.

826
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:38,710
Speaker 1: You're right, and then American bombers come so everyone's running away.

827
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:46,732
Speaker 0: Now this is a flashback to when the main character is like learning mahjong from the master back in the day and the master is Like.

828
00:55:47,815 --> 00:55:48,980
Speaker 1: I know what I must do.

829
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,706
Speaker 1: luck luck luck blah blah blah.

830
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:51,750
Speaker 1: and he walks back.

831
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:52,633
Speaker 0: At least they got it right.

832
00:55:52,673 --> 00:55:54,500
Speaker 0: mahjong is all about luck and nothing else.

833
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:04,756
Speaker 0: and he walks back into the building instead of evacuating Like I'm just gonna die today and he goes like up on the roof of the building and all the students are like no What are you going in the roof of the building?

834
00:56:04,776 --> 00:56:05,339
Speaker 0: You're gonna die.

835
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,450
Speaker 1: Oh my god, and it's set up like one of those.

836
00:56:07,636 --> 00:56:11,061
Speaker 1: All right This is how the like mentor with the main character died.

837
00:56:11,282 --> 00:56:19,349
Speaker 1: and then we're gonna have flashbacks to this all the time and you know Not quite to the gundam sea level of yelling out the people's names but I expected that yep.

838
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:24,130
Speaker 1: And then this is really a spoiler cuz you're probably not gonna watch this show and even if you do whatever.

839
00:56:24,732 --> 00:56:30,433
Speaker 1: So they come back out and he goes to like see if he's okay and the guys just taking a nap on the roof didn't Care at all.

840
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,245
Speaker 0: He's like, hey luck, right?

841
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,654
Speaker 0: Yeah My god.

842
00:56:34,675 --> 00:56:38,395
Speaker 0: Oh my they totally took the whole flashback to.

843
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:51,160
Speaker 1: you know, my mentor bit and turned it on and say and What we thought was a 50 yen coin Emily informed was that was actually a 50 zany coin and as any is We're nothing nothing.

844
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:52,670
Speaker 1: It's like what a hundredth of a yen.

845
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:56,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's our zany God who gets his name from the zany which is like a worthless coin.

846
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:04,678
Speaker 1: Yeah we knew that but we didn't know that that was any and we're like 50 yen's a lot back then because they're talking about 500 yen, like it's this crazy amount of money.

847
00:57:04,718 --> 00:57:07,790

858
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:42,008

859
00:57:42,028 --> 00:57:44,409
Speaker 1: God There's not much to it.

860
00:57:44,831 --> 00:57:50,710
Speaker 1: It's better than Akagi if you really are into initial D kind of shows and you know about mahjong.

861
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:55,270
Speaker 1: But you got to know about mahjong and you got to know about it from a Japanese perspective.

862
00:57:55,270 --> 00:58:06,490
Speaker 0: Yeah That's one thing that really got me is like I know how to play mahjong the Chinese way and I know how to play it The old Jewish lady way, right and I know the old Jewish lady terminology and I know the Chinese terminology.

863
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:13,330
Speaker 0: They're playing mahjong as far as I can tell the Chinese way, right, but they're using Japanese terminology.

864
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:15,921
Speaker 0: So I can't understand what's going on.

865
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:23,997

Speaker 0: Oh, it's quite frightening.

867
