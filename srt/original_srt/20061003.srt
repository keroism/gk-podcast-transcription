1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,587
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday October 3rd, and this is geek night tonight.

2
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:17,848
Speaker 1: We talk about Capcom classics mini-mix and Def Con.

3
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:21,128
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:24,741
Speaker 0: So today I did something that I haven't done for a long time.

5
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,246
Speaker 0: Maybe if you're real good about myself.

6
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,028
Speaker 0: I'm a big man.

7
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:30,009
Speaker 0: now I killed Hitler again.

8
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:31,477
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

9
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:32,381
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

10
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:34,150
Speaker 1: Hitler was dead before you were born.

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:34,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

12
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:35,856
Speaker 0: and kept.

13
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:48,906
Speaker 0: commander kilft brought him back and then He killed the guy after busting out of some lightning and then I shot him in the face after he said damn you So you didn't go to work?

14
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,173
Speaker 1: You went to Germany instead.

15
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:54,163
Speaker 0: see well I beat a game that I love.

16
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:56,129
Speaker 0: I beat bionic commando again.

17
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:58,806
Speaker 0: Uh-huh now unlike other times.

18
00:00:58,846 --> 00:00:59,309
Speaker 0: I've beaten it.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,230
Speaker 0: I beat it in a straight shot on a non emulated fully legitimate.

20
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:08,850
Speaker 1: No possible way to cheat medium, but so wait when you were a kid you never beat it on the NES.

21
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:11,450
Speaker 0: Oh, I did, but I didn't beat it that quickly.

22
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:14,124
Speaker 0: Aha, I mean usually I'd save up.

23
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:19,310
Speaker 0: my nine continues And then I'd spend like six of them on the last two stages.

24
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:22,304
Speaker 0: Falling in the fire over and over and over and over again.

25
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:23,470
Speaker 1: That's a good strategy.

26
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,099
Speaker 1: Falling in the fire sure way to win.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, well if I keep stacking up the bodies.

28
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:36,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if I had Megaman 2 on a on a cartridge for the GBA or the DS I would beat it just as easily.

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,750
Speaker 1: so yeah, there's some games.

30
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,942
Speaker 1: You just you know you never fail to beat him.

31
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:45,042
Speaker 0: once you know once you're the master I wonder we had to look up how long those games are cuz.

32
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,046
Speaker 0: that's something stupid.

33
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:48,154
Speaker 0: we could do with a con Megaman 2 vs.

34
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:48,816
Speaker 0: Bionic commando.

35
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:49,678
Speaker 0: who beats it first?

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,430
Speaker 1: yeah races, and you know single-player platformers.

37
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:58,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially if you're playing two different games that happen to have similar lengths or something crazy like that.

38
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, this actually reminds me of something.

39
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,670
Speaker 1: is that a long time ago?

40
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:03,587
Speaker 1: You may not know.

41
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:10,509
Speaker 1: But the Megaman games for the NES and the SNES and whatever are different from the Megaman games of the Gameboy.

42
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,393
Speaker 0: You don't say.

43
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:14,746
Speaker 1: yeah, Megaman 2 and 3 for the Gameboy and other.

44
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:17,074
Speaker 1: there are other Gameboy Megaman's are not.

45
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:21,407
Speaker 1: it's the same as Megaman 2 and Megaman 3 for the NES.

46
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:22,310
Speaker 1: They're different games.

47
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:26,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, not they have some of the same bosses, but they're different games mostly.

48
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:30,802
Speaker 0: yeah It's not just different like oh, they're in olive and brown instead of color.

49
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:32,226
Speaker 0: They're actually different games.

50
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:48,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Capcom you know they released Megaman mix which is you know Megaman anniversary edition Which all the Megaman's then they had a Megaman X which had all the Megaman X's But they haven't released the supposedly going to be released Megaman Gameboy mix.

51
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:52,844
Speaker 0: well Scott Why haven't they released this wonderful gem that we've been waiting for for all these years?

52
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:58,445
Speaker 1: well a long time ago Some talking about you know they lost code or something like that.

53
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:05,424
Speaker 1: and yeah Whatever the thing is is hey couldn't they just get the cartridge?

54
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:07,250
Speaker 1: cuz I mean I've seen cartridges around.

55
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,930
Speaker 1: They're not you know super common, but they exist.

56
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:19,610
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there's one at the GameStop or the EB or whatever across the river Yeah, and just rip the ROM out of it and put it on a Gameboy advanced cartridge with an emulator.

57
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:20,976
Speaker 0: You know what I'll bet.

58
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:28,570
Speaker 0: the answer to that is simply that that's probably the most rational Intelligent and expedient way to solve this problem, so of course no one would do it.

59
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,658
Speaker 1: I just want to point out the Capcom released Capcom classics mini mix for the GVA.

60
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:39,819
Speaker 1: that has three games in it, and they haven't released the Megaman mix Games three games.

61
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:43,728
Speaker 1: Yes, that is how many games not five Five is right out.

62
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:47,764
Speaker 0: But before we move on to the you know news the video game news.

63
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:54,509
Speaker 0: since it is video game day I would like to say do the thing I've been doing for the last two weeks And it'll end at the end of this week.

64
00:03:54,931 --> 00:04:03,678
Speaker 0: We are going to be this weekend October 6th 7th and 8th in Utica, New York for Citacon S I T a con.

65
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:16,410
Speaker 0: it is an anime and gaming convention that mostly anime mostly anime But there's gonna be pretty much 24/7 gaming video gaming mostly, but some also a little bit of role-playing gaming Yeah, also the fact that we're going to be bringing some German gaming.

66
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:31,890
Speaker 0: We are definitely going to be breaking out some gaming of the geek night's fashion, so if you live anywhere within about 400 miles of Utica, New York I highly recommend you come because regardless of this convention Which is a first-run convention it could be hit or miss.

67
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:37,390
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not gonna pretend that is it's automatically gonna be awesome because I don't know I'm optimistic.

68
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:44,122
Speaker 0: I think it'll be a good con, but I can guarantee 100% you got the front row crew backing this up.

69
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:47,314
Speaker 0: there will be awesome to be had At this con.

Speaker 1: you and me and that's it.

73
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:53,720
Speaker 1: well We're pretty much everyone else copped out and they want to go.

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,065
Speaker 0: the whole crew bailed on us.

75
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:56,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, what the hell guys?

76
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,690
Speaker 1: What the hell to their convention right there?

77
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,676
Speaker 1: And you all bailed to their credit.

78
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,870
Speaker 0: one of the people who is not coming is not coming because a relative died.

79
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,240
Speaker 0: Another one is getting some rather horrible dental surgery.

80
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:12,630
Speaker 0: No one else could get off work and some people live in, Texas.

81
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:17,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but I'm just saying that you know They could have come on Saturday for free.

82
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:17,618
Speaker 1: What it is.

83
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,084
Speaker 0: Well, they'd have to drive there.

84
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:20,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's relatively free.

85
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,011
Speaker 1: Come.

86
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:27,030
Speaker 1: a compared compared to what you're gonna get out of this convention, you know as to what it cost to get there.

87
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:28,955
Speaker 1: Come on, come on.

88
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:34,030
Speaker 0: I mean that I don't think you guys understand just how much we're gonna be pulling at this con.

89
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:43,341
Speaker 0: I mean if you have never been around us and seen the kind of hijinks we pull whenever social order breaks down I think that we are besides the con chair himself.

90
00:05:43,722 --> 00:05:45,969
Speaker 1: We are doing more at this convention than anyone else.

91
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,520
Speaker 0: I mean in addition to the events, we're running sanctioned.

92
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:54,281
Speaker 0: You will not understand the magnitude of the unsanctioned events We're gonna be running at this car.

93
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:59,190
Speaker 1: I mean at the bare minimum We're gonna be in the artists alley making an evil ruckus at bare minimum.

94
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,350
Speaker 1: But as soon as got artists alley closes watch us bust out crazy games.

95
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,950
Speaker 1: Watch us bust into the gaming room and set up impromptu video game tournaments.

96
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:12,868
Speaker 1: Watch us run around yelling and screaming and grabbing people and making mischief.

97
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:20,710
Speaker 0: Yep Plus while the front row crew is gonna be there We're gonna have Dave and Joel from fast karate for the gentlemen, my favorite rust hurricane related podcast.

98
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:24,422
Speaker 0: I gotta stop making these rust hurricane jokes.

99
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:26,050
Speaker 1: I know but they can't.

100
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,437
Speaker 0: Turcane what's?

101
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:29,967
Speaker 0: uh, what's Megaman week against?

102
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,260
Speaker 0: Ross hurricane Really?

103
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:37,338
Speaker 1: Yeah No, he's kind of equally weak.

104
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:45,722
Speaker 0: you can't defend against ten Ross hurricanes, okay, there we go Though also as a total aside before we get into the actual video game stuff.

105
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:54,404
Speaker 0: to all the people out there kind of question You know, hey if you guys ever seen homestar runner, the answer is yes We are well aware of home star runner.

106
00:06:54,444 --> 00:07:00,887
Speaker 0: great chair up there We uh slice we were watching them home star runners back when there were only ten strong bad emails.

107
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,534
Speaker 0: home style Home star.

108
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,810
Speaker 1: my favorite character home star is by far the best character cuz he is indeed.

109
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:18,476
Speaker 0: All I'd like to say is that while home star is awesome It played itself out for us.

110
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:21,686
Speaker 0: I'll pretty much four years ago.

111
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:26,190
Speaker 1: Oh the crap All right, let's get crazy good nuts.

112
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:27,889
Speaker 0: Okay with the video game news.

113
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,035
Speaker 0: We'll start with Scott cuz.

114
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,728
Speaker 0: my name isn't actually video game related at all.

115
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:32,190
Speaker 0: You suck.

116
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:41,835
Speaker 1: Anyway, so last year Activision made a study about video game advertising and everyone said hey Activision sponsored that study.

117
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,677
Speaker 1: We can't trust it.

118
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:42,838
Speaker 0: Now.

119
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:51,014
Speaker 0: You might remember Activision from such classic hits as pitfall river raid mech warrior 2 Yeah.

120
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,622
Speaker 0: Yeah, so two decades ago.

121
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:53,990
Speaker 0: They were a great game company.

122
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:58,828
Speaker 1: Well, they're a game publisher and they publish some good games and they publish some bad games.

123
00:07:58,868 --> 00:07:59,450
Speaker 1: and what do you want?

124
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,830
Speaker 1: I can't recall the fact that they've stuck around since the Atari days and they're still here is pretty impressed.

125
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,413
Speaker 1: You know why?

126
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:08,729
Speaker 0: because there are people who buy games like BMX xxx.

127
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,266
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that is the reason people like activists can continue to exist.

128
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:14,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine You know.

129
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,690
Speaker 1: at least you got to respect the fact that you know.

130
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:28,046
Speaker 1: A company like Atari is now just like a part of another company that gets bought and sold and traded around Activism Spanish hall Activision is still its own company owned by no one at least.

131
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:28,890
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure they are.

132
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,786
Speaker 0: So yeah, our listeners will probably correct us.

133
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:35,505
Speaker 1: if Scott is wrong I'm pretty sure that they're just their own game publisher owned by no one.

134
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:40,921
Speaker 1: So Yeah, they put out a study about game advertising and no one trusted it.

135
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:46,101
Speaker 1: So now com score media metrics Confirms the earlier findings.

136
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:50,221
Speaker 0: I still think that you study That's a really funny name for a for a place that does study.

137
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,570
Speaker 1: all the companies that do studies have names like that.

138
00:08:52,590 --> 00:09:00,541
Speaker 0: here's the thing is a lot of the ones that have the really long names like that are more or less study for hire and I'm real dubious.

139
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,289
Speaker 0: If anything they do.

140
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:10,810
Speaker 1: Anyway, the study says and this is the reason I believe it is because the numbers make sense Is that heavy gamers people who play at least 16 hours of video games a week?

141
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,379
Speaker 0: There's probably a joke about heavy gamers and fat game.

142
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,310
Speaker 1: Yeah something they were the most receptive to in-game advertising.

143
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:48,457
Speaker 1: By most receptive they mean that 37% only 37% of heavy gamers agreed that the inclusion of ads makes games more realistic and in terms of light and medium gamers only 27% of them agreed that advertising makes games more realistic which means that 63% of hardcore gamers and 73% of hardcore gamers do not agree that Realistic, you know ads make games more realistic.

144
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:48,638
Speaker 1: Now.

145
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:50,282
Speaker 0: I got a question about this up.

146
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,187
Speaker 0: Why did they need a study?

147
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:55,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's Common fucking sense.

148
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,989
Speaker 1: Well, you know when they first.

149
00:09:57,936 --> 00:10:11,850
Speaker 1: the topic of in-game Advertising has been pretty hot in the past six months to a year or so and when it first came up I thought you know ads in games aren't necessarily bad when they match the real world.

150
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,419
Speaker 1: I mean it makes a lot.

151
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,170
Speaker 1: it really takes you out of a game.

152
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:23,110
Speaker 1: Sometimes you need to drive down a highway in a game and the billboard says like, you know bake Oh something something and make up some phony product name.

153
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,973
Speaker 1: That's so phony.

154
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:30,019
Speaker 1: you just sticks out like a sore thumb and kind of ruins the you know, the atmosphere Yeah, and I gotta say even in movies.

155
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:37,830
Speaker 0: I always hated it when someone was drinking, you know Unlabeled soda because Pepsi and Coke wouldn't let him use the logo, but at the same time, you know all that BS.

156
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:41,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly what I'm talking about, you know, I mean sometimes a guy drinks a dr.

157
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:42,569
Speaker 1: Pepper let him pick his dr.

158
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:42,850
Speaker 1: Pepper.

159
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:49,449
Speaker 1: Yeah and there have been a lot of games in the past that have had in-game advertising like Ninja Turtles 2 had all those Pizza Hot ads.

160
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:56,340
Speaker 1: but those Pizza Hot ads made sense because well the Ninja Turtles ate pizza and They were just billboards on the wall in the game.

161
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,926
Speaker 1: They didn't stick out like sore thumbs.

162
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:58,870
Speaker 1: They didn't ruin the game.

163
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if I'm playing Grand Theft Auto and there's real billboards, I'd have no problem with that.

164
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,308
Speaker 1: In fact, I just uncovered the Ninja Turtles 2 arcade version for the NES.

165
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,614
Speaker 1: Oh Instruction book recently.

166
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:16,231
Speaker 1: on the back of it is a coupon for a free personal pan pizza that expired in 1991 1991.

167
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:29,901
Speaker 1: I think in 2011 20 years after that coupon expired I'm gonna go to a Pizza Hut and try to use the coupon with some sort of hidden HD camera And if YouTube still exists, we're gonna YouTube that at business.

168
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:32,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we should just use it now while we still can.

169
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:33,053
Speaker 1: I don't know.

170
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:35,687
Speaker 0: Yeah now the problem I have with the study is that they really.

171
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:39,010
Speaker 0: I mean It seems like they just asked if you let like ads in games or not.

172
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,134
Speaker 0: But I mean it.

173
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:47,138
Speaker 0: the context of the ad and the way the ad is used matters a lot more Than any other issue at stake here.

174
00:11:47,719 --> 00:12:01,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also the article goes on to talk about how Actually, this advertising generates a grand total of one to two dollars of profit per title sold Mmm, now they also make the point.

175
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:08,169
Speaker 1: if you compare that to the number of people who aren't gonna buy the game because of ads You're probably gonna end up losing money not making money.

176
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:17,769
Speaker 0: Well, they also point out if that's all it makes why not have an advertising version and then a non advertising version for a dollar fifty more?

177
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,421
Speaker 0: Hey, see which one people buying up.

178
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:22,510
Speaker 0: Maybe it didn't need the advertising one at all.

179
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:25,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I think that you know.

180
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:32,590
Speaker 1: The problem here is that if people put ads in games that were tasteful and correct No one would even notice or complain.

181
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:42,243
Speaker 1: Maybe some you know blog would notice and write a thing about it and most people would go and like if you went into a Bar in a game and the neon signs said bud Coors and Miller.

182
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:43,547
Speaker 1: No one would you know it?

183
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:44,810
Speaker 1: that's how bars look.

184
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,780
Speaker 1: That's how every bar in the country is like that.

185
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:48,207
Speaker 1: You know, that's just fine.

186
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:48,670
Speaker 1: Who cares?

187
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,016
Speaker 0: All right counterpoint.

188
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:58,910
Speaker 0: not not that I agree with this, but here's why One all these companies and in general, this is a big problem with IP law that I think should be rectified.

189
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:09,770
Speaker 0: I am of the mind that if you create an advertisement That is shown publicly and published that it should be able to be used in any medium by anyone for any purpose.

190
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:16,990
Speaker 0: Because now you have a situation where a company has you know, they're advertising copy out there billboard something.

191
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:23,050
Speaker 0: But if you're filming a movie and that billboard is in that movie the or that guy's drinking that kind of soda.

192
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:24,858
Speaker 0: You can't do that.

193
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,770
Speaker 0: The company usually won't let you do it without permission.

194
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:35,670
Speaker 0: So instead in whenever you're gonna have a product placement, you know They say drink a can of soda instead of just having it be whatever kind of soda they had in the fridge.

195
00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:45,994
Speaker 0: They have to go and you know say Pepsi Will you pay us to let your product be featured and it ends up being a product placement instead of just a product that happened To be used.

196
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:51,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, but regardless of what's going on behind the scenes, you know It's all about when you're playing a video game.

197
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,704
Speaker 1: You want to stay immersed.

198
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:55,397
Speaker 1: You don't want to be taken out of the game Just like when you're watching a movie.

199
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,254
Speaker 1: you want to be taken into the movie, you know We're like.

200
00:13:58,275 --> 00:14:00,912
Speaker 1: you don't even see the people sitting in front of you like, you know the.

201
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:04,684
Speaker 1: the movie takes up your whole brain, you know, your full attention is in it.

202
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,109
Speaker 1: and that's where you are.

203
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:09,778
Speaker 1: and You know a fake product can sometimes take you out of that.

204
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:14,430
Speaker 1: but so can you know the obtrusive placement of a real product?

205
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,149
Speaker 1: It has to be toned down.

206
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:23,653
Speaker 1: Realistic placements of real products or you know, usually tone down places are to keep you immersed, you know, yeah I mean good.

207
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:24,837
Speaker 0: I'm playing counter-strike.

208
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,945
Speaker 0: There's a sprite machine bad.

209
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:28,230
Speaker 0: I'm playing counter-strike.

210
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:32,264
Speaker 0: There's an ad for World of Warcraft and blazoned on the wall in the middle of the.

211
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,810
Speaker 1: that's exactly what I was gonna say.

212
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:34,844
Speaker 1: Is that you know?

213
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:39,929
Speaker 1: If there was proper in-game advertising, I wouldn't give a shit because I wouldn't even notice it.

214
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:45,250
Speaker 1: But there's a lot of all the in-game advertising that's going on now seems to be bullshit.

215
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,890
Speaker 1: For example, I was playing planetside a long time ago.

216
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,558
Speaker 1: Remember I complained about it and whatever.

217
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:58,930
Speaker 1: in the ready rooms in planetside I think probably because I was playing for free and not paying any money There were these giant castrol GTX ads on the walls.

218
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:00,549
Speaker 0: That's just silly.

219
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:06,590
Speaker 1: It is just silly has no place in that world where they probably don't even need oil and definitely don't need castrol GTX.

220
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:08,337
Speaker 1: And why would they pull me?

221
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:10,064
Speaker 0: a gamer could make that argument?

222
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:16,530
Speaker 1: I know but Why are there giant ads for the product when you can't even choose products in the game?

223
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,445
Speaker 1: The ads are in the teleportation rooms.

224
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:20,049
Speaker 1: I mean, come on.

225
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:21,496
Speaker 0: I think part of the reason should

226
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:23,042
Speaker 1: they at least be in the vehicle Bay

227
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:30,143
Speaker 0: when it comes to realistic games Would be simply that if the ads in a generally realistic game are in

228
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:30,705
Speaker 1: the same

229
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:36,527
Speaker 0: manner and placement of ads in the real World people would ignore them because people ignore ads in the real world.

230
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:37,070
Speaker 1: That's true.

231
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:49,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, because a lot of the ads in video games are scooby-doo-ified where they stick out, you know You'll have all these really high-resolution textures and then you'll have this JPEG That's really just slapped on on a wall somewhere.

232
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,701
Speaker 0: I mean worse is like a bright color.

233
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:53,330
Speaker 1: the lighting doesn't affect it.

234
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:55,559
Speaker 1: You know your bullet marks don't appear on it.

235
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:01,809
Speaker 0: It's you know, of course if the bullet marks appeared I would be drawing penises in bullet on every ad I saw.

236
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:04,520
Speaker 1: You know your flamethrower doesn't burn it.

237
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,510
Speaker 1: It has to act like everything else in the game.

238
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,447
Speaker 1: It can't be scooby-doo or else it doesn't work.

239
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:14,950
Speaker 0: However, the advertisers usually won't go for that because they don't want their you know logo to be defiled in any way.

240
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:20,810
Speaker 1: They want full total control and they're only making one $2 per copy of the game.

241
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,619
Speaker 0: So so why is it even an issue?

242
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:23,564
Speaker 0: why even bother?

243
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:24,609
Speaker 1: why I have this study?

244
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:32,049
Speaker 0: Because they were trying to sell the viability of advertising in their games to advertisers that they could make money.

245
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:36,843
Speaker 0: Yeah See, everyone always forgets that the advertiser.

246
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:45,190
Speaker 0: It's not the kind of industry you think You are the product being sold by the person who makes the thing to the advertisers.

247
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,246
Speaker 0: You're selling your eyes to the advertisers.

248
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,050
Speaker 0: You're the commodity.

249
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:50,715
Speaker 0: They are the customer.

250
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:53,603
Speaker 0: so they're not trying to please you in this sense.

251
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:58,277
Speaker 0: They're trying to please the advertiser Regardless of what you actually do.

252
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:03,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, they've already got your eyeballs, you know that they're trying to collect your eyeballs.

253
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:06,056
Speaker 1: They got ice cream scoops.

254
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:08,849
Speaker 1: They pluck them out of your head and then they sell them to somebody.

255
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:11,425
Speaker 0: You know, I saw a movie once where someone did that.

256
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:15,865
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, they took someone's eye out with a teaspoon and then they took their other eye out with the teaspoon.

257
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,069
Speaker 0: and it happened in Russia.

258
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:18,885
Speaker 0: No idea they already dead.

259
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,473
Speaker 1: no Okay, enough of that.

260
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:22,840
Speaker 1: I was in my news.

261
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:23,704
Speaker 1: What's your news my news?

262
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:24,630
Speaker 0: I was in like fifth grade.

263
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:26,369
Speaker 0: I don't remember anything about the news.

264
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:31,267
Speaker 0: If any remembers a movie in Russia where a guy gets his eyeballs scooped out with a teaspoon.

265
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:32,110
Speaker 1: What's rooms news?

266
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:33,982
Speaker 0: Why you don't like the eyeball scooping?

267
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:34,648
Speaker 1: Not really?

268
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,950
Speaker 0: No All right, my news will be quick because I don't want to get into too much depth about this.

269
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:45,066
Speaker 0: But New Jersey has had some problems lately, you know, they're in debt because the government is.

270
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:46,610
Speaker 1: when does New Jersey not have problems?

271
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:49,570
Speaker 0: Actually, you know people you have Jersey a bad rap.

272
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:54,422
Speaker 0: But once you get past, you know The Newark Jersey City like the area right next to New York.

273
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,289
Speaker 0: the rest of Jersey's not like that.

274
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:58,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know the problem.

275
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:09,250
Speaker 1: The only good thing I can say about New Jersey is that it has boardwalks It has a six flags and it has more comic book stores per square foot than any other state.

276
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:11,958
Speaker 0: No, no, they got cheap gas - all right cheap gas.

277
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:15,550
Speaker 1: Yes, but it's full serve only so that kind of balances out.

278
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:17,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still don't get full serve.

279
00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:23,227
Speaker 0: I mean I see why Jersey does it but I don't like other people pumping my gas.

280
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, me either I mean I just kind of.

281
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:29,430
Speaker 0: in fact, I accidentally today I went to get gas down in the Bronx, right?

282
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,081
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I pull into the gas station and the gas is like 235 a gallon.

283
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:34,674
Speaker 0: All right I'm like hot dams.

284
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:41,149
Speaker 0: I pull in and I start to get out and the guy points up and it says full and I look Around and I realize the whole thing is full service.

285
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:45,663
Speaker 0: Huh and it was weird because it was not New Jersey, yeah, you could.

286
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,650
Speaker 1: there there are full services outside of New Jersey.

287
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,356
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

288
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:50,009
Speaker 0: That's the first one I've ever seen.

289
00:18:50,271 --> 00:19:00,733
Speaker 1: I've never had full service outside of New Jersey in my life usually in Connecticut at least You know, most of the gas pumps are like you go to a gas station and one of them will say full and the rest Say so.

290
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,925
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you know those old people will go up to the full.

291
00:19:03,086 --> 00:19:03,770
Speaker 0: see where I grew up.

292
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,270
Speaker 0: You know in sterling heights in Detroit.

293
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:09,425
Speaker 1: Oh, you know in Rochester in RIT right next to RIT at that coastal.

294
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:10,710
Speaker 1: That was all also the mechanic.

295
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:12,094
Speaker 1: You know that place?

296
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a full service only gas station.

297
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,150
Speaker 0: I never went there.

298
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:16,479
Speaker 1: I know I never went there for gas.

299
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,184
Speaker 1: I went there for my kids.

300
00:19:17,204 --> 00:19:18,632
Speaker 0: It was more expensive I know.

301
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:23,350
Speaker 0: well, no, it's actually cheaper usually but it wasn't cheaper than the place up Scottsville Road a bit.

302
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:31,278
Speaker 0: Anyway, no one cares about that No one cares, but where I grew up every service station had the full service sign But no one actually had full service.

303
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,462
Speaker 0: those signs were just legacy.

304
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:36,020
Speaker 0: if you pulled up and sat there No one would do anything.

305
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,770
Speaker 0: They just stare at you Yeah, which every now and then would happen when some out of stator was driving around.

306
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:53,101
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway now New Jersey has decided that the best way to get rid of their four point five billion dollar debt Not spend four point five billion dollars on crap.

307
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:54,947
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is they've already spent it.

308
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:55,730
Speaker 0: They can't undo it.

309
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,633
Speaker 0: It's not a deficit.

310
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:57,255
Speaker 0: It's a debt.

311
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,362
Speaker 1: get taxes from people.

312
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:01,670
Speaker 1: All right, New Jersey has very high property taxes.

313
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:05,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's some of the highest in the country and as a result, they have some of the best schools in the country.

314
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,170
Speaker 1: Yeah and take the money that you don't have to spend on crap and pay off your debt.

315
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:11,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then the government shuts down.

316
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:13,373
Speaker 0: Now here's the thing.

317
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:19,110
Speaker 0: They're the way they're handling this aside from writing a billion parking and speeding tickets everywhere.

318
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,150
Speaker 0: So watch out if you're traveling in Jersey.

319
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:31,908
Speaker 0: But they've decided to one raise the sales tax to seven percent and more importantly Expand the things that sales tax covers.

320
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:40,817
Speaker 0: now you have to pay sales tax on health club memberships security alarms tanning storage space and iTunes music store downloads.

321
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:41,580
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

322
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:42,022
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

323
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:47,038
Speaker 1: all those other things I can understand perfectly And I don't know why people weren't paying sales tax on those things before.

324
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,174
Speaker 1: but iTunes music store downloads now one Apple Probably.

325
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:55,449
Speaker 0: I don't know the deal but they I'll bet they want nothing to do with this.

326
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:56,761
Speaker 1: No, they got nothing to do with

327
00:20:56,802 --> 00:21:09,676
Speaker 0: it, which means that the way Jersey is going to have to enforce this is that you'll have to declare your iTunes music downloads on your tax forms as like a use tax or something and They'll get you if you don't pay it.

328
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,588
Speaker 1: Nah, I just pay the minimum because I'm a wuss.

329
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,993
Speaker 0: now Yeah, I pay them.

330
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:18,065
Speaker 0: Of course the minimum for my income is like a couple bucks.

331
00:21:18,206 --> 00:21:18,828
Speaker 1: Yeah.

332
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:21,068
Speaker 0: Yeah Plus I didn't buy so much online last year.

333
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:22,678
Speaker 1: It's really so.

334
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:25,050
Speaker 1: eventually someone's gonna have to fix this problem.

335
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:37,370
Speaker 1: Perhaps I think with a federal law because there's a lot of state border crossings going on here with the Internet's That you know finally seals the deal on how we pay sales tax on things online.

336
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:43,810
Speaker 0: You know if I buy a bunch of stuff on you realize that if you go to a different County and buy something.

337
00:21:44,131 --> 00:21:51,611
Speaker 0: Technically you have to pay a use tax because you would have paid the piddly point whatever percent sales tax from the county you lived In.

338
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:57,999
Speaker 0: yeah, but because you left the county you lived in and went to another county to buy something You're somehow ripping off your County.

339
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:00,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not gonna talk about tax law.

340
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:00,814
Speaker 1: No, we're not.

341
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:02,829
Speaker 1: but I'm just saying someone has to fix it.

342
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:09,730
Speaker 1: Sometimes is a problem that's going to eventually jump up and bite everyone in the ass when we're thinking about these more important things.

343
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:18,842
Speaker 1: yeah, it's like after we saw this terrorism bullshit and this DRM and freedom bullshit and Those days are behind us and it's that and it's good times again.

344
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:21,170
Speaker 1: This is gonna be the problem that comes up next.

345
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:34,770
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean just generally tax sales tax law and use tax enforcement in general because use tax was never enforced Until state started running out of money and then suddenly they started trying to enforce it, but it's impossible to enforce.

346
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:43,887
Speaker 0: So instead of enforcing it, right and having you actually pay it They make you pay a minimum penalty and that way you're basically paying the extortions.

347
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:44,850
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's a penalty.

348
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:53,699
Speaker 0: It's basically you pay an amount of money in order to be protected from having to pay what you actually owe Even though you probably owe less than that minimum.

349
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just too much effort to figure it out.

350
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,890
Speaker 0: Here's my other issue about this because we could do a whole show about this stupid thing.

351
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:04,261
Speaker 0: Now you buy something from iTunes, right?

352
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,370
Speaker 0: It's a DRM file.

353
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:09,036
Speaker 0: Now do you really own it?

354
00:23:09,157 --> 00:23:10,341
Speaker 0: What did you just purchase?

355
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:12,650
Speaker 0: Are you purchasing a license to listen to that music?

356
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,316
Speaker 0: Are you purchasing the music itself?

357
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:15,843
Speaker 0: Are you purchasing the file?

358
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:17,330
Speaker 0: How is this going to be taxed?

359
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:18,999
Speaker 0: What if I give it to someone else?

360
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,070
Speaker 0: do I what if I sell it to someone else?

361
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:22,680
Speaker 0: What if I trade it with someone else?

362
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:24,330
Speaker 0: if you start taxing this shit?

363
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:29,610
Speaker 0: There are so many ramifications that I'm sure John Corzine has never even heard of.

364
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:37,534
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean he's probably trying to jam his envelope into a tube speaking of which I was gonna use it as news But it's not much to say about it.

365
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:39,921
Speaker 1: But today is day against DRM.

366
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:44,773
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah DRM bad Yep so Fire.

367
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:51,535
Speaker 1: but I guess since you know today is already over because most people listen to this the day after as opposed to at night Like they should be listening to it.

378
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:30,925
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yes, if it's true if Australians are the biggest non-us listener base we have I'll buy a bottle of Foster's and break it for you.

384
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:09,885
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah, I've been fiddling around with music as you could tell from the last several episodes.

385
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:14,876
Speaker 0: cuz I'm thinking of changing up a lot Of the music in season two of geek nights If you have an opinion on that?

388
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:30,848
Speaker 0: Anyway, my thing of the day actually lets me tell a story from way back.

389
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:35,944
Speaker 0: This was either 19 like maybe seven or 58.

390
00:25:35,944 --> 00:25:38,411
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it was 1998.

391
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,956
Speaker 0: Might have been early 1999, but I think it was late.

392
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:40,699
Speaker 0: 1998 was in high school had my car.

393
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:52,030
Speaker 0: Me Ken and Dan, you know the core of our D&D group went to my first LAN party in Southfield, Michigan.

394
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:57,310
Speaker 0: We crammed my Pentium 200 and their computers into my car.

395
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:58,674
Speaker 0: The car is so small.

396
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:03,090
Speaker 0: Dan had to sit with a 17 inch CRT on his lap for an hour while we drove.

397
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:10,230
Speaker 0: No I had a cell phone with me because my parents were worried something would happen because I'd never driven somewhere like that before.

398
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,615
Speaker 0: I mean I barely had my license.

399
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:16,503
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I had this brick of a cell phone that had to be plugged into the car to use.

400
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:21,475
Speaker 0: and we go to this LAN party and It was the first time.

401
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:26,670
Speaker 0: I mean I had a ping of like one and I was playing action quake on a LAN.

402
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:28,093
Speaker 0: It was crazy.

403
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:28,975
Speaker 0: Like that was.

404
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:30,418
Speaker 0: that was amazing.

405
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:37,373
Speaker 0: I couldn't believe how awesome it was to play LAN games on a LAN Like I couldn't.

406
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:39,118
Speaker 0: also we pirated everything.

407
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:43,510
Speaker 0: everyone copied every program they had every music file they had and we all swapped.

408
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:50,030
Speaker 0: It's what LAN parties were except this one guy who didn't have a big enough hard drive and couldn't get it all.

409
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:55,110
Speaker 1: See if I was going to a LAN party today like that giant ones they have in Sweden Norway and shit.

410
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,066
Speaker 1: You know where this like giant giant convention halls.

411
00:26:58,106 --> 00:26:58,810
Speaker 1: It's full of computer.

412
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, were you like stake out a spot and live there for a few days?

413
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:04,082
Speaker 1: You can go online and look at pictures of these things.

414
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:08,588
Speaker 1: if I was going to one of those places I would buy a 300 gigabyte hard drive and bring it with me.

415
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:13,090
Speaker 1: hell I might buy a NAS and bring it with me and it's perfectly empty.

416
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:19,338
Speaker 1: I would format it with it like an XFS partition and fill it up as the week as you know the LAN party could progressed.

417
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:24,170
Speaker 0: so my first LAN party and Towards the end of it, you know, it's winding down.

418
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:42,820
Speaker 0: It's about four in the morning and I'm pretty much totally knocked up on jolt Cola after playing a whole bunch of action quake and weapons factory and Then they decide all right is movie time because one guy had this projector and he was playing quake on the projector Which also blew my mind back then because projectors are common now.

419
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:44,646
Speaker 0: They were not common in the late 90s.

420
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:49,824
Speaker 0: a Projector you could plug into your computer was this crazy expensive amazing thing.

421
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:53,255
Speaker 1: It was the guys probably a rich He was.

422
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:54,742
Speaker 0: he funded the LAN party.

423
00:27:54,782 --> 00:28:01,790
Speaker 0: We had to pay some pittance to get in And also while we played the big games the projector showed the score the whole time.

424
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,676
Speaker 1: But HLTV is the awesome.

425
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:07,145
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't know about HLTV.

426
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,897
Speaker 1: That wasn't HLTV I know but I'm not gonna talk about it now.

427
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,524
Speaker 0: Okay, but that wasn't HLTV.

428
00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:13,050
Speaker 0: I know I know that was quick, too.

429
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,100
Speaker 1: I was just reminded of the existence of HLTV, which is awesome.

430
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:16,381
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

431
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,397
Speaker 0: All right, so we're there and it's movie time So they're all talking.

432
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:21,421
Speaker 0: What should we watch?

433
00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:23,048
Speaker 0: Let's watch father Frank's best.

434
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:25,910
Speaker 0: Whoo And none of us have any idea what the hell this guy's talking about.

435
00:28:26,492 --> 00:28:32,930
Speaker 0: Then he starts up quick too and he loads a mod and the mod Wasn't a game mod.

436
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:44,382
Speaker 0: It was a mod that basically played out a sitcom called father frags best within quake 2. it was the first encounter I ever had with machinima.

437
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,095
Speaker 1: machinima.

438
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:56,949
Speaker 0: machinima is the idea of taking games and Doing and using the games to create content like using quake 2 the engine of quake 2 to film a movie.

439
00:28:58,273 --> 00:29:06,565
Speaker 0: hmm, and Don't bother reading the Wikipedia on this if you are more interested in it because the Wikipedia article is kind of dubious and full of crap.

440
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:13,957
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll rewrite it someday, but this is one of the earliest Well-known machinimas out there.

441
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:18,670
Speaker 0: So you remember Scott's thing of the day yesterday the urinal thing that was machinima - what the Sims?

442
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Sims in Sim City and whatever.

443
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:30,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, or like there's a very very popular one - uh, you know Avenue Q The internet is for porn - World of Warcraft and is red versus blue with halo and whatever.

444
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:32,296
Speaker 0: Yep Yep, that is all machinima.

445
00:29:32,657 --> 00:29:37,738
Speaker 0: And this is one of the earliest earliest Items of this.

446
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,770
Speaker 1: Yeah is one of the first machinimas.

447
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:45,610
Speaker 0: I'll warn you it's funny if you're a hardcore gamer and even then not so much.

448
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:46,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.

449
00:29:46,593 --> 00:29:47,858
Speaker 1: it was back in the day.

450
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:50,408
Speaker 1: It was hilarious because things like this didn't exist.

451
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:59,496
Speaker 1: So You shouldn't watch this expecting to be laughing hysterically because unless you're super old-school, yeah, it's like that Hiyama, Kaga juichi thing.

452
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not that good.

453
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:04,690
Speaker 1: It's more that it's like all your base are belong to us.

454
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,717
Speaker 1: It's not funny anymore history lesson.

455
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:08,784
Speaker 0: It's a museum exhibit exact watching.

456
00:30:08,824 --> 00:30:10,630
Speaker 0: This is seeing a piece of internet history.

457
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:17,450
Speaker 0: Yep, however, if you need Quake 2 to play it because I looked and I didn't see any video mirrors of it.

458
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:27,959
Speaker 0: So you basically have to install Quake 2 which is free And then install this mod and then run the mod And then this thing will play out including outtakes at the end.

459
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:31,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is worth watching it is.

460
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:38,249
Speaker 1: All right, so College humor calm has this new awesome video called Street Fighter the later years.

461
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:41,759
Speaker 1: now It's actually really well done and awesome.

462
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,249
Speaker 1: Like you think it's just gonna be corny, but it looks like you know.

463
00:30:46,234 --> 00:30:48,570
Speaker 1: If it was any better, it could be put in a real movie theater.

464
00:30:48,771 --> 00:30:53,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Scott says oh there's a Street Fighter 2 thing on College humor and I think what whatever?

465
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:58,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it starts out with these two kids playing Street Fighter in an arcade.

466
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:01,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like Chun Li versus I know it's Zangief versus Dalsin.

467
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,142
Speaker 0: Oh Dalsin.

468
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:02,403
Speaker 0: Was it?

469
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:03,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was.

470
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:04,688
Speaker 0: I think at that fight It might have been Chun Li.

471
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,383
Speaker 1: No, anyway, so one guy's Zangief and he's like man.

472
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,250
Speaker 1: if this are real I could totally kick your ass.

473
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,090
Speaker 1: He's like what if you were you or if you were a Zangief?

474
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,019
Speaker 1: He's like no if I was Zangief right in the background.

475
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,330
Speaker 1: now you see this janitor with a kind of looks like Zangief.

476
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:21,130
Speaker 1: He starts crying.

477
00:31:22,151 --> 00:31:24,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially when the one kids like Zangief's a bitch.

478
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:29,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know, I'm not gonna tell you where it goes from there because what's the point of watching this?

479
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,175
Speaker 1: But it's really well done.

480
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:35,330
Speaker 1: It's really hilarious and there's gonna be more parts, which I can't wait for.

481
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:37,584
Speaker 0: This is what the Street Fighter movies should have been.

482
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,510
Speaker 1: I think about this.

483
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:45,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a Street Fighter movie a live-action one in the United States With Van Damme and it was ass.

484
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,021
Speaker 1: It's famous for being ass.

485
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:47,803
Speaker 1: I saw it in the theater.

486
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:48,425
Speaker 1: What?

487
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:50,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck's wrong with you.

488
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,254
Speaker 1: Oh, what do I know?

489
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:53,041
Speaker 0: It was such a movie.

490
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:55,430
Speaker 1: I knew everyone knew it was ass.

491
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,052
Speaker 1: It was ass.

492
00:31:56,173 --> 00:32:00,390
Speaker 0: as you like Jean-Claude Van Damme you watch fucking Bloodsport and that's it kickboxer.

493
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,890
Speaker 1: But no Bloodsport, whatever.

494
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:09,430
Speaker 1: Anyway, some fucking kids on College Humor have made a better movie and it's only they only did five minutes.

495
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,889
Speaker 0: If the rest of its like this though hot damn now, we're not saying better than Street Fighter 2 the anime.

496
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:18,590
Speaker 1: No, no, we're saying better than Street Fighter 2 the American live-action movie.

497
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:23,629
Speaker 0: If this was a trailer for an actual movie, I would see it on opening night.

498
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,679
Speaker 1: I would bootleg it and watch it before opening night.

499
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:27,441
Speaker 1: And then oh, yeah.

500
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:28,645
Speaker 1: Yeah wait lines.

501
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,450
Speaker 0: I believe that part is unstated.

502
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:32,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, so go and watch this.

503
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:35,494
Speaker 1: if you know anything about Street Fighter at all This will be funny.

504
00:32:35,976 --> 00:32:41,347
Speaker 1: If you don't know anything about Street Fighter, it's not gonna be as funny But you'll still see how well done it is.

505
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:43,997
Speaker 0: So on to the main bit.

506
00:32:44,037 --> 00:32:47,490
Speaker 0: we're gonna go back to the original format of gaming day.

507
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:47,972
Speaker 0: Meaning.

508
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,168
Speaker 0: Scott and I are each going to review a separate game kind of anime world order style.

509
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:53,617
Speaker 0: Holy crap I don't know.

510
00:32:53,677 --> 00:33:04,151
Speaker 1: This is some kind of crazy trend Mmm, or maybe because we both just got into new games or maybe it's because we just have so much stuff to cover that we can't possibly cover it at the rate of one thing per Week.

511
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:06,785
Speaker 0: or maybe the fact that I'm not gonna talk much about my thing.

512
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:18,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, that could be it too Alright, so I've been waiting for this pretty much since I heard it was coming out and I bought it as soon as was reasonably possible the Capcom classics mini-mix.

513
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:27,588
Speaker 0: It's a Game Boy Advance cartridge that has three Awesome classic games from the NES days, but rim only cares about one of those games.

514
00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:36,882
Speaker 0: Yes effectively I paid $20 which is less than I paid when the fucking game came out for bionic commando aka Hitler no Fukkatsu.

515
00:33:37,043 --> 00:33:38,170
Speaker 1: Hitler no Fukkatsu.

516
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:47,509
Speaker 0: now this game is Famous for one being one of the most innovative platformers in the history of early gaming.

517
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:53,634
Speaker 0: Mmm, I mean this is it looks like a normal platformer guy gun gun shoots But here's the.

518
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:56,925
Speaker 0: here's the gimmick guy can't jump at all.

519
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:58,230
Speaker 1: He's a white man in.

520
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:08,251
Speaker 0: Instead you've got this bionic arm and you can grab things and swing around and the game is mostly Acrobatics.

521
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:15,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much it's all about shooting the bionic arm in the correct direction with the correct timing.

522
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:24,149
Speaker 1: And that is how you move around in this game and the levels are complex And if you can't manipulate that bionic arm properly, you're not gonna make it very far.

523
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:27,909
Speaker 1: Did I give enough innuendo with a bionic arm, I think you did okay.

524
00:34:28,512 --> 00:34:31,223
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was gonna make a joke about in the right direction.

525
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:31,603
Speaker 1: Yep.

526
00:34:31,844 --> 00:34:35,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, right timing Yeah Manipulating the bionic arm.

527
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,056
Speaker 0: Okay Now if you've never played this game.

528
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,864
Speaker 0: find an M or ROM or something and play or no.

529
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:42,650
Speaker 1: go buy Capcom classics mini mix.

530
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:43,214
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

531
00:34:43,254 --> 00:34:43,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll get to that.

532
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,668
Speaker 0: Okay, but this game is Absolutely fantastic as in it's one of my favorite games ever.

533
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:51,415
Speaker 0: Not gonna talk.

534
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:56,315
Speaker 0: I'll do a separate show about bionic commando Because we can talk all about Hitler.

535
00:34:56,335 --> 00:35:03,342
Speaker 0: No, that's not the point here because it also comes with Strider an equally Classic Nintendo game.

536
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:04,330
Speaker 1: Strider is classic.

537
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:13,484
Speaker 1: however it is the opinion of me and most other people that I have encountered that the Sega Genesis version of Strider is the real Strider and the NES version is kind of a.

538
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,437
Speaker 0: I have not really played either To an extent to where I could make a judgment.

539
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:22,154
Speaker 0: Yes, the game is pretty typically early NES game Strider.

540
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:35,565
Speaker 1: the character is Strider here you who's a very famous character because of these games but you know He you'll often see him in like all the voting for like best video game characters and so and he has.

541
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:39,787
Speaker 1: he's basically like a super pretty shonen boy who?

542
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:46,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, the plot is something like there's lots of fancy swords and our friend Kane has been kidnapped.

543
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:53,602
Speaker 1: Kill him, yeah Lots of fancy jumps and sword slashes while killing robots.

544
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:56,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, it probably make a better anime than a game.

545
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a pretty good platformer.

546
00:35:58,315 --> 00:36:03,430
Speaker 1: Basically just as good as bionic commando except for the lack of innovative bionic arm manipulation.

547
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:08,227
Speaker 0: I would say no because the controls in Strider are a lot looser than bionic commando.

548
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:11,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are loose But I mean bionic commando is one of the tightest games out there.

549
00:36:12,351 --> 00:36:17,839
Speaker 1: But in terms of being a platforming game where you whack stuff and it blows up It's it's kind of it's in the same vein.

550
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,350
Speaker 1: They weren't wrong to put it on the same cartridge.

551
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:25,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course the third game on here is mighty final fight now, which is one of the greatest final fights.

552
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:30,150
Speaker 0: I want to say right now in case any of you aren't really up on Japanese sensibilities.

553
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:35,569
Speaker 0: But final fight were some fairly violent walk down the street and beat people up game.

554
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:37,415
Speaker 1: Yes They're pretty much in those days.

555
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:41,488
Speaker 1: There were two series of walk down the street beat people up games.

556
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:45,333
Speaker 1: There was Final fight and Streets of Rage.

557
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:50,090
Speaker 1: streets of rage is for the Genesis and stuff and final fight was for the NES and SNES.

558
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:54,305
Speaker 0: Yep, I played final fight in the arcade a lot and I only ever played as Haggar.

559
00:36:54,406 --> 00:36:55,510
Speaker 1: Yeah streets of rage.

560
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,189
Speaker 1: I actually think the series overall was better.

561
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:04,330
Speaker 1: But any if you're talking about an individual game of walk down the street beat people up River City Ransom.

562
00:37:04,731 --> 00:37:17,203
Speaker 0: But besides that final fight 3 I think for the SNES that had the really hot anyway anyway to not get off track Adding mighty do final fight does not make them larger or stronger.

563
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:20,010
Speaker 0: It makes them super deformed and funny.

564
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,367
Speaker 1: That's what mighty final fight is all about.

565
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,982
Speaker 0: mighty Final final fight is a romp.

566
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:31,444
Speaker 0: you walk to the right Jump kicking people in the face until they die and you repeat it until you've killed everyone.

567
00:37:31,464 --> 00:37:33,128
Speaker 1: That's what that game is.

568
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:37,270
Speaker 0: now I'm not gonna review the three games because they're classic games.

569
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,155
Speaker 0: I mean, what am I gonna say?

570
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:40,729
Speaker 0: I could review them all separately in other shows years from now.

571
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:49,638
Speaker 0: But the actual GBA cartridge is very high quality as in it is 100% faithful to the three games.

572
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:53,850
Speaker 0: you can't save your game, which is the only thing I actually would complain about.

573
00:37:54,553 --> 00:37:56,222
Speaker 0: You can't glitch you can't cheat.

574
00:37:56,403 --> 00:37:57,850
Speaker 0: You can't do anything.

575
00:37:58,331 --> 00:38:00,156
Speaker 0: Basically, you start the ROM.

576
00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:08,240
Speaker 0: it is identical to how it was on the Nintendo right down to the slowdowns and the glitches Except for the aspect ratio because you're on a GBA screen.

577
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yes screen the aspect ratio has changed slightly.

578
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:12,414
Speaker 0: That's it.

579
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:13,678
Speaker 0: Nothing else has changed.

580
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:16,830
Speaker 0: all the same cheat codes work all the same glitches work.

581
00:38:17,232 --> 00:38:26,670
Speaker 0: The games are 100% faithful to the originals Which is a little annoying in the fact that you can't save your game or suspend or anything.

582
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, they can be a little annoying.

583
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:34,110
Speaker 1: you expect those sorts of nice tees and you know remakes or re-releases of very old games.

584
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,896
Speaker 0: Of course, it's only 20 bucks.

585
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:37,301
Speaker 1: Yeah 20 bucks.

586
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:39,910
Speaker 1: GBA game brand new three games.

587
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:41,719
Speaker 0: I'd especially recommend it.

588
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:47,569
Speaker 0: if you've never played bionic commando I mean that game god damn.

589
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:53,690
Speaker 0: Now I wanted to get through that real quick because the more interesting game to talk about today is the game Scott's been playing.

590
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,623
Speaker 0: That I will be playing as soon as I have the ability to do so.

591
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:58,713
Speaker 1: Yes now I don't know.

592
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:01,222
Speaker 1: I hope you've seen the movie war games.

593
00:39:01,343 --> 00:39:03,794
Speaker 1: if you haven't seen the movie war games What?

594
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:04,899
Speaker 1: what the fuck's wrong with you?

595
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:06,508
Speaker 1: What kind of what kind of geek are you?

596
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:10,084
Speaker 1: You know what everyone's seen this movie and you have to see.

597
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:11,289
Speaker 0: it's sort of like to play a game.

598
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:12,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of like a requirement.

599
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:13,589
Speaker 1: How about a nice game of chess?

600
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:18,924
Speaker 1: It's a really classic movie and in the movie.

601
00:39:18,964 --> 00:39:24,423
Speaker 1: There's a computer whatever and At the end the computer is playing this game.

602
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:25,850
Speaker 1: What's the name of the game?

603
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,798
Speaker 1: It's like global Nuclear war nuclear war.

604
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:38,444
Speaker 0: now aside from the fact that the game the movie war games Made hacker culture known to the masses.

605
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:43,626
Speaker 0: that was the the Inspiration for almost all of the computer geeks out there currently.

606
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:47,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much I mean the movie showed war dialing right away.

607
00:39:47,731 --> 00:40:03,029
Speaker 1: Anyway, the game thermonuclear war global thermonuclear war show it was basically a map of the world That was like an outline of a map of the world and it had little pictures of missiles with lines behind them showing the trajectories of the ICB M's and the event of a global thermonuclear war.

608
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:08,770
Speaker 1: And it would show up US would get totally blowed up in Russia would get totally blowed up, you know.

609
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean this is you know in movies like I don't know.

610
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:22,708
Speaker 0: It was in the Cold War era like Doctor Strange Love one of those the big board where you see, you know Here's what the people actually doing all the big decisions are seeing and the nuclear war blah blah blah.

611
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:24,714
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, that's the thing.

612
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:31,574
Speaker 1: This is made by introversion software the people who brought you uplink and Darwinian I believe in uplink.

613
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:35,186
Speaker 0: There's an easter egg where you can play global thermonuclear war.

614
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:35,567
Speaker 1: Is there?

615
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:36,410
Speaker 1: I don't know if there is.

616
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:38,279
Speaker 0: I read that in multiple places.

617
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:40,249
Speaker 0: Okay, I didn't play uplink enough to find it.

618
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was never.

619
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:43,441
Speaker 1: I wasn't good enough at uplink to get anywhere.

620
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:45,810
Speaker 1: really I could do a few missions and then I was stuck.

621
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:50,990
Speaker 1: But the point is that this company is pretty much my hope for PC gaming.

622
00:40:51,791 --> 00:41:00,305
Speaker 1: They are the only people making innovative new PC games and they seem to specialize in taking The way things appear in movies and making them real.

623
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:03,477
Speaker 1: like uplink is Basically a game where you hack.

624
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:07,370
Speaker 1: you hack the same way that people in movies hack not the way people hack in real life.

625
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:16,593
Speaker 0: Yeah you know images of people flying by while you're looking for the file and you see like the red line of the tracer program that's Tracking you down.

626
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:22,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's also a very good game uplink, but Def Con is their new game, which is super cheap.

627
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:27,395
Speaker 1: I mean this thing is $15 on Steam for the full version $15.

628
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:29,210
Speaker 1: in November, there's gonna be a Linux version.

629
00:41:29,912 --> 00:41:32,362
Speaker 1: You can get like you could just download the game.

630
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:33,306
Speaker 1: you can download the demo.

631
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:36,999
Speaker 0: Okay, it's 1750 to download it from the Def Con site.

632
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's 1750 for the non steam version.

633
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:41,717
Speaker 1: So get if you if you have steam.

634
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:44,226
Speaker 1: if you got a steam account, I recommend you use the steam one.

635
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:49,029
Speaker 1: Yep, but This is essentially what you know.

636
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:53,925
Speaker 1: The big war map in the war room is like in a movie only a game.

637
00:41:54,206 --> 00:41:57,501
Speaker 0: I just picture, you know But I deny them my essence.

638
00:41:57,923 --> 00:42:01,243
Speaker 0: Yeah The game's creepy as fuck.

639
00:42:01,304 --> 00:42:12,990
Speaker 1: It's a pretty creepy game I gotta say because you know while the strategy and the play of the game is pretty typical for what you know A very clever RTS that you know doesn't have the same problems every other RTS.

640
00:42:14,193 --> 00:42:24,963
Speaker 1: It has this eerie kind of music and you are Nuking the hell out of the whole world and you're getting nuked and it's you know, you hear sometimes it's like really faint screaming I think and but

641
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:29,323
Speaker 0: it's so understated like it's because it's all just kind of this like not really.

642
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:37,109
Speaker 0: it's kind of like what the president of the United States at Least in the movies would be watching as this war went down and the DC got nuked.

643
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:42,257
Speaker 0: Well, he's obviously in like looking glass or something Obviously, but you know be like you.

644
00:42:42,538 --> 00:42:54,525
Speaker 0: you click like you click on Tokyo and you just you know Launch ICBM and then you'd like you'll see later like in Russia like launch detected launch detected meaning that they're launching ICBMs and you don't know what's going on.

645
00:42:54,827 --> 00:43:00,050
Speaker 0: and then you know You see your little trajectory and it hits Tokyo and it just there's a white flash not even a flash.

646
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:04,475
Speaker 0: Just a white thing appears and it just says, you know Four million dead.

647
00:43:04,656 --> 00:43:10,237
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says like in big square letters like Tokyo 4.1 million dead.

648
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:11,260
Speaker 0: and that's it.

649
00:43:11,762 --> 00:43:14,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I love how the game is scarred.

650
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:17,230
Speaker 0: You were scarred in the number of people you kill.

651
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:20,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, you kill people you get points and you get killed you lose points.

652
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:26,285
Speaker 0: Default scoring as other scoring methods unit score is effectively mega deaths.

653
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:30,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, but The game is labeled the world's first.

654
00:43:31,118 --> 00:43:34,087
Speaker 1: genocide them up, which is pretty hilarious.

655
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:37,663
Speaker 0: I say But well, isn't the website I like?

656
00:43:37,703 --> 00:43:38,386
Speaker 0: kill them all?

657
00:43:38,587 --> 00:43:39,110
Speaker 0: dot-com?

658
00:43:39,431 --> 00:43:43,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the interesting thing about everybody dies everybody - dies.

659
00:43:43,648 --> 00:43:43,809
Speaker 1: calm.

660
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:51,250
Speaker 1: The reason that this game is so awesome to play is because it's an RTS that doesn't have problems of other RTS.

661
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:51,932
Speaker 1: Is you know how?

662
00:43:51,992 --> 00:43:57,630
Speaker 1: if you play Warcraft 3 it's essentially a game of who knows what order to build the units in.

663
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:08,790
Speaker 1: you know who can click the fastest to build the units the fastest and You know who can build a whole bunch of one unit and send them off to destroy the other guys base.

664
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:14,290
Speaker 0: Yep, it's who figured out the click sequence that makes one more tank than the other guy to win the game.

665
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:16,050
Speaker 1: Yeah now in DEFCON is not how it works.

666
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:21,605
Speaker 1: Everyone gets pretty much the same amount of stuff depending on which territory you pick and all that.

667
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:25,040
Speaker 1: but you start with stuff And that's what you get.

668
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:26,349
Speaker 1: You don't get any more than that.

669
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:29,590
Speaker 1: You're never gonna get more nukes or anything like that.

670
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,595
Speaker 1: You get what you get.

671
00:44:31,037 --> 00:44:36,101
Speaker 1: you deploy it and you spend it the rest of the game Utilizing it and then it's over now.

672
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:38,170
Speaker 1: The game starts at DEFCON one.

673
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:42,546
Speaker 1: You then have a few minutes before DEFCON 2, DEFCON 3, DEFCON etc.

674
00:44:44,254 --> 00:44:46,910
Speaker 1: Oh, no, you start game start DEFCON 5 and counts down to one.

675
00:44:47,774 --> 00:44:50,888
Speaker 1: So in DEFCON 5 that's when you're deploying stuff.

676
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:53,110
Speaker 1: now You can set the speed of the game.

677
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:58,150
Speaker 1: The lowest speed is real time where one second in the game is one second in real life.

678
00:44:58,331 --> 00:45:03,450
Speaker 0: Now the Wikipedia claims that people play it in full real time and they spend most of the time diplomacying.

679
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:09,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they do that they're crazy because it takes three hours to play that game if you do it in real time.

680
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,262
Speaker 0: Well, it says here they can take up to eight hours.

681
00:45:11,604 --> 00:45:11,966
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

682
00:45:11,986 --> 00:45:17,830
Speaker 1: That's even crazy Yeah, but the point is is that I most people don't play the game in real time.

683
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:21,023
Speaker 1: At least I haven't ever played in real time all the way through.

684
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:22,910
Speaker 1: you generally play at a sped up level.

685
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:31,690
Speaker 1: Now the way the speed works is you choose a speed one, two, three or four and in a multiplayer game It goes at the lowest speed voted.

686
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:35,905
Speaker 1: So let's say everyone wants to go at max speed but rim wants to go at real time.

687
00:45:36,206 --> 00:45:37,270
Speaker 1: it goes at real time.

688
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:46,348
Speaker 1: So rim puts it in a real time does whatever he wants to do and then speeds it up again when he's done Managing whatever he wanted to manage, you know, and I think that's a pretty good system.

689
00:45:46,428 --> 00:45:56,550
Speaker 1: actually You know, but so the game goes in DEFCON 5 to 1 and in the early DEFCON's you're building stuff And then there's a boat fight and then does the nuke fight?

690
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,642
Speaker 0: Yep, like pretty much DEFCON 5 and 4 are essentially the same.

691
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:06,850
Speaker 1: Yeah only it doesn't matter It's just DEFCON 4 is sort of like DEFCON 3 is coming up and DEFCON 3 is when the boats fight.

692
00:46:07,272 --> 00:46:09,526
Speaker 0: Yep, conventional warfare is authorized.

693
00:46:09,586 --> 00:46:14,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, the The boat fight is pretty much where the game is decided.

694
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:25,010
Speaker 1: I've noticed because if your boats survive to the to the later levels They will be able to prevent a lot of nukes from hitting you and they will also be able to deliver a lot of nukes.

695
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:35,770
Speaker 1: So if you put all your boats in an ocean and win that ocean You can now have a serious advantage In terms of nukes going over that ocean, you know.

696
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:40,169
Speaker 1: And then the game goes on some more and then the ICBMs go and woo.

697
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:46,250
Speaker 1: There's just nukes everywhere and it's all about defending from the nukes and sending the nukes so that they destroy the other guy.

698
00:46:46,752 --> 00:46:48,578
Speaker 0: I really want to stress how eerie it is.

699
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:51,388
Speaker 0: I mean even watching this game is a very eerie experience.

700
00:46:51,729 --> 00:46:57,950
Speaker 1: Yeah It's just the theme the music generally and how it looks and it's it's really.

701
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:06,496
Speaker 0: They get the point across and yet at the same time there seems to be enough strategic depth and fun to make the game Incredibly interesting.

702
00:47:06,677 --> 00:47:07,218
Speaker 1: there is.

703
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:09,025
Speaker 1: so it's really strategic.

704
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:15,430
Speaker 1: like this stuff I couldn't even begin to think about like you have these the missile silos.

705
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,237
Speaker 1: Here's an example the missile silos.

706
00:47:17,277 --> 00:47:18,782
Speaker 1: when they're not shooting missiles.

707
00:47:19,425 --> 00:47:20,830
Speaker 1: They are defending from missiles.

708
00:47:21,473 --> 00:47:28,850
Speaker 1: so and if you decide to fire a Missile everyone now knows that there's a silo there because they can detect launches.

709
00:47:29,775 --> 00:47:39,268
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like giving up your position when you fire but you're also giving up your position at when you put your defenses down and There's all sorts of other stuff like that.

710
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:48,578
Speaker 1: It just in this radar and there's submarines and there's airplanes and it's that it's out of control But it's actually.

711
00:47:48,598 --> 00:47:51,050
Speaker 1: there's not too many things to manage in the game.

712
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:57,493
Speaker 1: I mean you only have three kinds of buildings and three kinds of boats and that's it It's.

713
00:47:57,654 --> 00:48:08,530
Speaker 1: it is barely anything to manage and if you do the tutorial and you pay attention You'll pretty much be the master of doing everything in the game, but you won't have a strategy that wins at all.

714
00:48:09,313 --> 00:48:09,955
Speaker 1: You know, and let's see.

715
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:22,610
Speaker 1: I played this game against the CPU a bunch of times and I played online Four times and the fourth time was a game with a lot of people and I did Okay, but when I played the one-on-one games, I won all three of them.

716
00:48:22,911 --> 00:48:30,949
Speaker 1: You know the one complaint I have about the game is it's hard to get a game together Like you'll go online to join a server and the guy will drop out.

717
00:48:31,512 --> 00:48:34,282
Speaker 0: This isn't a complaint against the game just the complaint against people playing.

718
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:36,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you'll join you'll play against a guy.

719
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:37,536
Speaker 1: He won't know what he's doing.

720
00:48:37,576 --> 00:48:41,800
Speaker 1: He'll quit you'll see a server You'll try to connect to it and it won't work.

721
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,409
Speaker 1: You have to quit and try another server.

722
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,270
Speaker 1: It's.

723
00:48:44,932 --> 00:48:48,062
Speaker 1: it's generally just sort of a pain to get a game going.

724
00:48:48,323 --> 00:48:51,072
Speaker 1: once the game is going with a reliable players You're okay.

725
00:48:51,273 --> 00:48:55,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems like you really got to play with reliable people who are dedicated to at least one full game.

726
00:48:55,837 --> 00:49:05,036
Speaker 1: Yeah I think what the ideal a situation is to find your friends and play against them and screw the people on the internet because you Can't realize playing against your friends.

727
00:49:05,257 --> 00:49:08,750
Speaker 0: one aspect of the game is that you can form alliances which are even in the game.

728
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:09,534
Speaker 0: It lets you share rate.

729
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:12,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can play with anywhere from two to six people.

730
00:49:13,092 --> 00:49:15,809
Speaker 1: So, you know, I played a game that was three on three.

731
00:49:16,111 --> 00:49:20,890
Speaker 1: It was three people versus three people, you know, and the Alliance is set up for the beginning and unchanged.

732
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:22,869
Speaker 1: But you know, that's that's not the point.

733
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:30,742
Speaker 1: but it could play a game of six, you know six individual players and You make alliances and break alliances in the game.

734
00:49:30,923 --> 00:49:32,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's an actual game mechanic.

735
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:38,070
Speaker 0: But the thing is while you can do all the alliances you want There is no such thing as an allied victory.

736
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:43,872
Speaker 0: So in the end the Alliance will end in a traitor because it has to yep It's it.

737
00:49:44,032 --> 00:49:46,581
Speaker 1: only one person wins and that's whoever gets the most kills.

738
00:49:46,842 --> 00:49:55,422
Speaker 0: so I could see spending like four hours Playing this game with all your friends with the full-on Negotiating with each other like Scott we could.

739
00:49:55,462 --> 00:49:57,290
Speaker 0: we have to gang up and take out cops.

740
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:02,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, because he's a he's a renegade and that that East Asian co prosperity sphere can't stand to be there any longer.

741
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:11,670
Speaker 1: There are lots and lots of advanced play options But I haven't even begun to explore them yet because I'm still not done with the regular play option yet.

742
00:50:12,253 --> 00:50:20,026
Speaker 0: so I guess in closing check this game out and Probably in a month or two once more people have played it and we've played it a lot.

743
00:50:20,106 --> 00:50:21,130
Speaker 0: We'll talk about it again.

744
00:50:21,492 --> 00:50:24,450
Speaker 0: Maybe a sort of final thoughts once we figured it out.

745
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:28,210
Speaker 1: Well, there's a demo of the game that I urge everyone to get even if you're not gonna.

746
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:31,710
Speaker 1: I mean this thing runs at a Pentium 600 megahertz processor.

747
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:32,312
Speaker 0: You know what?

748
00:50:32,352 --> 00:50:34,540
Speaker 0: It doesn't run it with a GeForce to Linux.

749
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:36,226
Speaker 1: It will in November in November.

750
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,956
Speaker 1: There's a Linux version They'll be.

751
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:39,289
Speaker 1: so don't worry about that.

752
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:41,719
Speaker 1: It's another introversion.

753
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:46,037
Speaker 1: software is very good about supporting Linux But the demo version.

754
00:50:46,438 --> 00:50:50,870
Speaker 1: the biggest caveat of the demo version is that in a multiplayer game?

755
00:50:51,371 --> 00:50:53,579
Speaker 1: Only one player can be a demo player.

756
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:57,840
Speaker 1: So if you get the demo and your friend gets to the demo You can't play against each other.

757
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:09,030
Speaker 1: It doesn't work But you can play against me because I bought the game Just two of your friends who have the demo and me couldn't play together because there's more than one demo player.

758
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:10,014
Speaker 1: Did I get that across?

759
00:51:10,576 --> 00:51:11,600
Speaker 0: I think you got it across.

760
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,363
Speaker 1: Okay, that's.

761
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:16,324
Speaker 1: I think that's a pretty clever way to Differentiate the demo from the full version.

762
00:51:16,344 --> 00:51:19,879
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, sorry Def Con is an awesome game.

763
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:25,911
Speaker 1: If you haven't seen war games, you need to go see that movie ASAP and And Download this game.

764
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:36,027
Speaker 0: and that was geek nights with rim and Scott special.
