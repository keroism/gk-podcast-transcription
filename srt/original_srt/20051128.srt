00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,767
Speaker 1: It's Monday November 28th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:25,606
Speaker 1: today We talked about well sort of nothing because it was kind of a crazy weekend since you know No, Thanksgiving show and the whole bunch of stuff, so We just keep talking about stuff for about 45 minutes.

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,319
Speaker 0: Enjoy, let's do this do this.

4
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:34,415
Speaker 1: So I'm walking to work from the train station.

5
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,284
Speaker 1: Okay, and I'm next.

6
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:40,040
Speaker 1: I'm on the the south side of the library near Bryant Park.

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:53,920
Speaker 1: You know walk in west and I hear a scream from across the street alright, so it was kind of this weak-ass scream like And I thought it was just like some horse playing kids or something like that.

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,227
Speaker 1: You know that's what it sounded like.

9
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:55,710
Speaker 1: was you know?

10
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:57,400
Speaker 1: just some people fooling around?

11
00:00:57,581 --> 00:01:02,360
Speaker 1: You know maybe a guy like you know messing with his girlfriend or something right, but they hear it again.

12
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:08,900
Speaker 1: So of course I turned my head to the left to see what's up And I see a lady or a girl.

13
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:20,466
Speaker 1: I couldn't really tell because I only looked for like a half second at this point like on the ground And I'm like oh, maybe someone pushed her or something right you know In a half second later.

14
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:21,832
Speaker 1: I realized wait a minute.

15
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:30,959
Speaker 1: There's a guy with a purse running and I'm like freaking purse snatcher.

16
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:39,934
Speaker 1: There's no way Who would be so dumb to snatch a purse these days in a crowd of people.

17
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:41,663
Speaker 1: I Can't.

18
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:42,899
Speaker 1: it is a purse snatcher.

19
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:45,358
Speaker 0: Okay, did someone stop him?

20
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,457
Speaker 1: Three guys immediately like grabbed him and like smashed him into this car, and I was like oh Yeah, well that that's expected right there.

21
00:01:54,497 --> 00:02:00,379
Speaker 1: Yeah But it was just so amazing that someone could be so dumb.

22
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:03,683
Speaker 1: It It's like alright.

23
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:08,818
Speaker 1: There's a people who are dumb, and it's like okay that guy's dumb, but I understand his dumbness.

24
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,366
Speaker 0: um You don't read FARC.

25
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:18,076
Speaker 1: no no I see the things on FARC But I mean you see something on FARC like guy sets himself on fire attempting stupid stunt.

26
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:19,801
Speaker 0: right and you know you see these Things.

27
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:34,605
Speaker 0: on FARC like guy sets himself on fire because he lit a match to look inside of a gas tank All right, or guy Rob's Store with no weapons in broad daylight when there's a police officer in the store See, but things like that.

28
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,438
Speaker 1: I can at least understand what the person who was doing it was thinking.

29
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:38,940
Speaker 0: really.

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,800
Speaker 0: So why did the person who robbed a store in broad daylight with no gun and there was a cop there?

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,522
Speaker 0: What was he thinking?

32
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,626
Speaker 1: He was thinking one.

33
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:48,499
Speaker 1: he probably didn't have a weapon - he wanted to rob the store.

34
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,666
Speaker 1: three He thought we'd get away with it.

35
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:51,680
Speaker 1: and four he didn't notice the cop before he ran.

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,650
Speaker 0: Oh the cop was a uniformed officer standing there.

37
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,720
Speaker 1: He did he not notice the cop?

38
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,279
Speaker 1: He must have not noticed the cop.

39
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:58,925
Speaker 0: No, he was just dumb.

40
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:02,300
Speaker 0: the cop just walked over and got him putting handcuffs on him.

41
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:04,120
Speaker 1: He must have not seen the cop in the store.

42
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,614
Speaker 1: There's no way he could rob the store after seeing the cop right there.

43
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:08,860
Speaker 0: It was a small store.

44
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:11,085
Speaker 1: I think he didn't see the cop.

45
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:17,997
Speaker 1: There's no way anyone could be so dumb, but anyway the point is this purse snatcher It was just the dumbest guy.

46
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,710
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god was just.

47
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:21,594
Speaker 1: it was serical.

48
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:33,086
Speaker 1: and then like a little crowd formed You know and I was like, you know, hey I took a few pictures and then I was kind of hoping they would kind of bugged me about taking pictures like a little You know, but they didn't bug me.

49
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:36,639
Speaker 0: cuz wait, so this is the story you've been talking up all night.

50
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:45,546
Speaker 1: I saw your snatcher that it's a good story, but you were talking it up so much cuz it's so rare and it's so It's like it's not really.

51
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:46,930
Speaker 0: I mean I was mugged once.

52
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,963
Speaker 1: it's not imagine if you were standing there when the dumb guy used a match To look in the gas tank.

53
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:52,107
Speaker 1: That's what this is.

54
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,234
Speaker 1: Like you're standing there watching FARC.

55
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:55,659
Speaker 1: It doesn't happen every day.

56
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does happen every day just in different place.

57
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,695
Speaker 1: doesn't happen every day.

58
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:00,799
Speaker 1: to you looking at it.

59
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,485
Speaker 0: No, but I read about it every day.

60
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean it was.

61
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:19,339
Speaker 1: and then that I was standing over there You know and I got pictures of this guy lying on the ground, you know, I thought I would put a big poon on it eventually, but The the cop who showed up when someone ran to go get him was like, what are you looking at me?

62
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,245
Speaker 0: You should have taken this picture.

63
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:21,969
Speaker 1: I did.

64
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:23,335
Speaker 0: All right, what do you do?

65
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:27,149
Speaker 1: Oh So the the cop was like who saw it?

66
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,373
Speaker 1: so I'm like, oh I saw it.

67
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,277
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

68
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:30,300
Speaker 1: I don't want to be a witness.

69
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:32,064
Speaker 0: Are you kidding?

70
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:33,750
Speaker 0: you being a witness is like your dream?

71
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:39,130
Speaker 0: You'd have a you'd have a forget you just be on the stand like No, so some ladies like I saw it.

72
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,518
Speaker 1: I'm like, all right, I can go to work.

73
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:42,604
Speaker 1: So I went to work.

74
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:43,549
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

75
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,780
Speaker 0: I would have rather been witnessing than working.

76
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:53,160
Speaker 1: Yeah Frankly though if I was gonna be a perfectly honest witness, I didn't actually see the guy take the purse.

77
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,489
Speaker 1: I saw that guy with the purse.

78
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,823
Speaker 1: I saw the lady on the ground and I saw three guys Apprehend him.

79
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:01,626
Speaker 0: that's fine.

80
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,630
Speaker 0: So you say that how do?

81
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,894
Speaker 0: maybe it wasn't a person at your.

82
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,340
Speaker 0: maybe those three guys were in cahoots?

83
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:07,323
Speaker 1: No, no.

84
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:09,232
Speaker 1: No, I'm 100% sure this guy was a person at you.

85
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:10,780
Speaker 0: But uh, did you see him snatch the purse?

86
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:12,506
Speaker 1: I saw him with the purse running.

87
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:16,040
Speaker 1: Ah, I heard the scream and I saw the lady on the ground.

88
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:20,139
Speaker 1: I think that doesn't leave much room for reasonable doubt.

89
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:22,830
Speaker 0: That's for the course to decide.

90
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:24,160
Speaker 1: it is for the court to decide.

91
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:25,525
Speaker 1: Let's let them do so.

92
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:26,127
Speaker 1: but I got.

93
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:33,379
Speaker 1: I got some pictures, but I learned a couple lessons about picture-taking Number one don't have the camera way in the backpack.

94
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:39,522
Speaker 1: If I would have gotten it out sooner, I could have taken pictures of his weak-ass kung fu He.

95
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:46,099
Speaker 1: basically the only fight he put up was you know, trying to run away and and you know Get out of the grappling of the guys.

96
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,940
Speaker 1: He managed to get his hands free and he did like a little flurry of blows up into the air.

97
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:55,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if I would had a picture of that it would've been hilarious But I couldn't get the camera out fast enough.

98
00:05:56,482 --> 00:06:06,383
Speaker 1: The second thing I learned is keep well besides keeping the camera in your pocket ready to go in any moment You know is just hold the button down and take a zillion pictures Because

99
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:08,570
Speaker 0: you can always crop things out later and because it's

100
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:11,500
Speaker 1: a digital camera and I have so many megabytes of space in there.

101
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:23,980
Speaker 1: I took four pictures because Number one I took a picture right and then I looked around to try to get another shot And then people started milling about in my way and that was just like screw damn.

102
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:32,157
Speaker 1: So from now on if any if I ever see anything crazy, I'm just gonna be like whip it out.

103
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:32,859
Speaker 1: click click click click.

104
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I noticed you got the camera sitting there at arm's length right now, yeah, you want to look at the pictures.

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,607
Speaker 1: They're pretty funny.

106
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:43,534
Speaker 0: Uh See it was a good story, but you talked it up so much all night.

107
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:48,010
Speaker 1: Like I got this crazy story Happens to you doesn't happen every day.

108
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,280
Speaker 1: It's like a once-in-a-year thing.

109
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:54,886
Speaker 0: So you guys but honestly if that happened to me, I would have come home and I would said hey So I saw a purse snatcher.

110
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:59,647
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just it's special for I would just said yeah Well, I grew up in Detroit.

111
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:06,920
Speaker 1: So it's special for me because you know Not only is it not something you see every day, but I didn't think purse snatchers still existed.

112
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:17,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, I grew up in the land of not just purse snatchers, but like outright muggers I mean he's like and if there was a purse snatcher you snatch a purse late at night in a dark alley where there's no one Else around.

113
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:21,759
Speaker 1: you don't snatch a purse on a crowded street as people are walking to work.

114
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:29,812
Speaker 0: It depends if you a snatch a purse in a crowd and you just keep walking like nothing's up and stick it under your trench By the time she goes.

115
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:32,805
Speaker 0: hey someone stole my purse This guy first.

116
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:34,332
Speaker 1: he had to wrestle it away from the woman.

117
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,200
Speaker 1: This isn't like a pickpocket pickpocket.

118
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:40,934
Speaker 0: You got to wait for the person walking by with the purse that's hanging by a thread.

119
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:42,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, that's good.

120
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,266
Speaker 1: But this guy this was not.

121
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:45,552
Speaker 1: this is actually the purse.

122
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:47,239
Speaker 1: I was pretty surprised was freaking huge.

123
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,830
Speaker 1: It was like half a suitcase man.

124
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,180
Speaker 1: It had these giant handles.

125
00:07:52,180 --> 00:08:00,687
Speaker 1: I was like, whoa There must have been something really good in there or this guy needed some serious money to buy drugs or something To make him do something soda generally.

126
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:04,840
Speaker 0: I've seen that the bigger purse someone has the less money they actually have in it.

127
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:10,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what was in there But there must have been something good that he knew was in there for him to take it.

128
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:11,580
Speaker 1: so dumbly.

129
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:14,980
Speaker 0: I'm glad I don't need to carry enough stuff on me to require a purse.

130
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,068
Speaker 0: I carry a tiny wallet that has everything.

131
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:19,900
Speaker 1: I got too many gizmos now, but I can fit him in all my pockets.

132
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,544
Speaker 0: So it's all good sound have so many gizmos and usually if I go anywhere where I need gizmos I have my trench coat.

133
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,830
Speaker 1: I only take the gizmos I need.

134
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:31,638
Speaker 1: I don't take all my gizmos everywhere But I do take all my gizmos to working back every day because I can and have a backpack and stuff.

135
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:36,652
Speaker 0: so Someone fixed at least one of the problems with the Xbox.

136
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:38,580
Speaker 1: Oh the the crashing.

137
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, they suspended the powers fly by a string and it didn't overheat anymore.

138
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,280
Speaker 1: I guess that works.

139
00:08:45,901 --> 00:09:03,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, apparently the pot if you were looking the owner's manual and basically the only way to actually use the Xbox correctly is to Put it on a hard cool Surface away from any other object and put the power supply on a similarly hard cool surface far away from everything and they can't even Be near each other.

140
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:09,947
Speaker 1: It's so weird because some people have the problem and some people don't and other people have kind of the problem and other people It's just crashing all over the place.

141
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:12,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people do reports or numbers or anything.

142
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:15,651
Speaker 0: It's definitely some sort of hardware overheating issue.

143
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:23,215
Speaker 1: I heard one theory was that People were talking about how much money Microsoft loses on the Xbox 360.

144
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:26,326
Speaker 0: Yeah about 140 bucks 126 whatever.

145
00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:39,031
Speaker 1: but the the point was is that guy basically did his calculations based on the normal prices of the components and then they were talking about how Microsoft bought in bulk and they got a Discount on the components that wasn't calculated in because of how much they bought.

146
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,298
Speaker 1: and then they're like then they bought some.

147
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:46,755
Speaker 1: maybe they bought Some cheaper components than you think in order to get the price down even more.

148
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,240
Speaker 1: so they make less of a loss.

149
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,840
Speaker 1: But maybe the cheaper components are why it's crashing.

150
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:56,075
Speaker 0: Well part of the problem is honestly computer power supplies are very unreliable.

151
00:09:56,477 --> 00:10:03,320
Speaker 0: even top-end Server data center power supplies are actually pretty piss-poor and fail on a fairly regular basis.

152
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:07,264
Speaker 1: I had one fail on me and I didn't even know that was it But I couldn't.

153
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:08,193
Speaker 1: now I'm gonna remember it.

154
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:13,597
Speaker 0: for the rest of my life I've had three power supplies fail on me in my time as a personal computer user.

155
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:15,650
Speaker 0: two of them were Antec's.

156
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:18,552
Speaker 1: I believe Antec makes power supplies.

157
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,027
Speaker 1: Yeah That's when I bought my new computer.

158
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:26,955
Speaker 0: I bought like this super and at work thing at work I've had at least ten servers have power supplies.

159
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:27,800
Speaker 0: just go or start.

160
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:35,140
Speaker 1: Like the more power says something has and the more power supply it has the more likely it is to just not work.

161
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:50,980
Speaker 0: Actually the what what goes on there is that almost every power supply even from companies you think you trust that make power supplies They really really really overstate the power and when you buy a 500 watt power supply It can really only output 300 watts reliably.

162
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:56,978
Speaker 1: Well, that must be why the 300 watt power supplies don't actually make the computers boot and you need to get the 400 watt one.

163
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless you buy a real power supply from an actual company.

164
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:04,960
Speaker 0: But those are very very expensive because switched power supplies are very expensive.

165
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:14,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, see as long it doesn't really matter as long as it did they're consistent, you know It's like how many people who buy a 400 watt power supply for their computer?

166
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,500
Speaker 1: Actually like are counting the watts and and all that kind of stuff.

167
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,619
Speaker 1: They're just trying to get something that'll make the computer boot And as long as they know the right number to buy to make that happen, it's it's all good.

168
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:36,819
Speaker 0: Though I mean with the Xbox at least it seems to be more an issue of Microsoft didn't test the Xbox in an actual environment where someone might use it that could be part of it.

169
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,980
Speaker 1: I think also some people are right in that.

170
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,400
Speaker 1: I think a lot of the giant power supply bricks are a mixture of different parts and all kinds of crazy things to cut costs.

171
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:47,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems very likely.

172
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:53,256
Speaker 0: Well, the Xbox itself has its own issues because that if you've heard reports that it's loud.

173
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:54,420
Speaker 0: That's an understatement.

174
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:56,250
Speaker 0: It's louder than my computer.

175
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:01,860
Speaker 0: My computer is a 70 pound Monstrosity in a giant tower with rattling fans.

176
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:07,019
Speaker 1: I wish there was some way we could raise your computer off the ground with a string to prevent it from overheating.

177
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:10,623
Speaker 0: My computer isn't actually overheat It beeps.

178
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:22,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it beeps and I fixed that by raising the threshold at which it beeps thing is my computer is fairly reliable and Yeah, I'm not buying a new one anytime soon.

179
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess though if I buy a new one I can record this cast in stereo instead of mono.

180
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,826
Speaker 1: Hey, you just buy a new sound card for that.

181
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:31,130
Speaker 0: No, my sound card does it.

182
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:38,660
Speaker 0: it just post-production becomes really really slow because My computer takes a long time to condense a bunch of tracks into two as opposed to into one.

183
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:38,933
Speaker 0: You

184
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:41,067
Speaker 1: know you could use my computer or Pete's computer

185
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:45,639
Speaker 0: now because the time the the time and effort of putting all the files on your computer doing it and then

186
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:50,397
Speaker 1: You could use SSH and then you use some command line programs and yeah,

187
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,070
Speaker 0: yeah I do that

188
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,738
Speaker 1: don't have the skills.

189
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:57,940
Speaker 0: No I just have to actually do it every day and then go over into your computer and do it or X forward into your computer.

190
00:12:58,161 --> 00:12:59,345
Speaker 1: You could use Pete's computer.

191
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,934
Speaker 0: the server server is not that fast.

192
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,440
Speaker 1: It's a lot faster than your computer.

193
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:05,426
Speaker 1: How fast is it fast as my computer?

194
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:08,577
Speaker 1: I think it's like a one point six gigahertz.

195
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:10,564
Speaker 0: I think yeah I got a one gigahertz.

196
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:12,151
Speaker 1: So you got point six more.

197
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,220
Speaker 1: also, it's an Athlon XP not a Thunderbird.

198
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:19,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem the limiter still seems to be ran because the CPU doesn't max out most of the time.

199
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,791
Speaker 1: Well, that computer also is a crap ton of rain.

200
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:23,520
Speaker 0: My computer has almost a gig around.

201
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:25,083
Speaker 1: Well, there you go.

202
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:32,213
Speaker 1: my computer doesn't so much only is 512 but it's it's DDR 400s real fast Of course, I also got a crappy Sound Blaster live.

203
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:33,360
Speaker 0: It's actually a platinum.

204
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,540
Speaker 1: It's the best Sound Blaster live yet a Sound Blaster live value of my computer, but I don't use it anymore.

205
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:39,740
Speaker 1: I use the enforce thing that's on the motherboard.

206
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:44,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the value and the platinum are the same except they solder some things to the point of breaking them.

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,609
Speaker 1: Well values they don't have the original original value.

208
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:52,483
Speaker 1: when I when I bought the value the only choices were value and gold Didn't exist.

209
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,149
Speaker 0: I bought the platinum the day it came out.

210
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,377
Speaker 1: platinum came way later like a year later.

211
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:57,320
Speaker 0: wasn't that much later?

212
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:01,293
Speaker 0: No, it was actually pretty quick because the platinum and the regular.

213
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,240
Speaker 0: the only difference between them is the software they come with.

214
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:05,791
Speaker 1: Yeah, they never really changed the card that much.

215
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,680
Speaker 1: They just kept re-releasing it with different labels.

216
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,659
Speaker 1: Remember they had like an mp3 plus and a game.

217
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:14,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only one that's different is the value because the value is actually missing a lot of core functionality.

218
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:15,926
Speaker 1: That's all I needed back in the day.

219
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:18,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it gave me my 4.1 audio.

220
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:19,218
Speaker 1: It sounded good.

221
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:19,640
Speaker 1: It was cheap.

222
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:20,289
Speaker 1: I was there.

223
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:31,611
Speaker 1: Ah Nowadays, I got high quality stuff with the onboard whatever with the optical and my new speakers which do most of the work because Linux sure as hell doesn't do the work About speakers that do it instead.

224
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:40,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, so U of R Developed this new thing where they can actually take pictures of retinas in people's eyeballs.

225
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:41,644
Speaker 0: That's kind of old news actually.

226
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:45,354
Speaker 1: But yeah, I saw that and apparently everyone has different cones and rods.

227
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:47,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, didn't we talk about that?

228
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:49,410
Speaker 0: Already I don't think so.

229
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,023
Speaker 1: All right, I never saw this before Really?

230
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,894
Speaker 0: Cuz I thought we talked about it not on the podcast just in general.

231
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:56,320
Speaker 1: We might have talked about something related.

232
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,009
Speaker 0: No, I'm pretty sure we talked about that itself.

233
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:02,590
Speaker 0: I looked at my aim log at work tomorrow Maybe but the thing we talked about today on aim.

234
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,838
Speaker 1: No, we didn't I think we did.

235
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:17,060
Speaker 1: But anyway The thing is is that even though everyone has different cones and rods They're pretty sure that everyone's brain kind of arrives at a very similar result despite huge differences in the cones.

236
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:18,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did talk about this.

237
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,500
Speaker 0: It's the same reason why even though you see something like a room under yellow light.

238
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:31,000
Speaker 0: You still know what color everything is and you still see it as red even though In terms of light, it's actually not red at all and nothing would detect it as red, but your eyes still sees it as red.

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you'd think that people with like a bunch of red cones would see red stuff better, but maybe actually yeah They would see it better, but they still see it as red.

240
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:42,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like maybe they would see green stuff more poorly.

241
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:45,500
Speaker 0: But that's why that's one of the reasons why women tend to have.

242
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:53,874
Speaker 0: women actually have more rods and cones in their eyes specifically a lot more cones and Women tend to actually be able to differentiate between colors much better than men.

243
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:56,485
Speaker 1: Uh-huh That's cool.

244
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:59,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know nothing wrong with my eyeballs.

245
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:05,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though you didn't seem to see the microphone stand sitting right next to the other microphone stands a Radio Shack.

246
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,708
Speaker 1: Hey, it's nothing to do with it Mr.

247
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,899
Speaker 1: Can't tell red from orange?

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,699
Speaker 0: I Note that in mule the color of the characters on the orange team is orange not red.

249
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,454
Speaker 1: There were things that are red and you point to them and say they're orange.

250
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:28,277
Speaker 1: you point to things Advance wars which are red and you say they're orange now because if you look at the palette, they're actually orange.

251
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,000
Speaker 1: Oh, they're not.

252
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:29,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are.

253
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:35,972
Speaker 0: Oh, they're not anyway Mmm, so Sony's rootkit fiasco is just getting better and better.

254
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:37,316
Speaker 1: What the hell this kid.

255
00:16:37,337 --> 00:16:38,260
Speaker 1: this has to be over by now.

256
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:49,640
Speaker 0: No, apparently the company that made the rootkit forum first for internet Someone found a couple of posts from an employee of theirs who was asking for help on these news groups.

257
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,879
Speaker 0: He wanted people to give him the source code to lame and like to help him write everything and he was offering money for it.

258
00:16:56,081 --> 00:17:16,339
Speaker 1: So Sony basically hired this crap company to make something for them and they hired a crap programmer and that one crap Programmer who didn't know what the hell he was doing ended up making the giant giant butterfly effect type fiasco where his tiny tiny stupidity made a huge problem for everybody.

259
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:17,944
Speaker 0: a Quote from his post.

260
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:24,772
Speaker 0: I know it sounds like I'm just after some free code due to my laziness But I really don't have the time and I'm serious about the cash.

261
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:26,220
Speaker 0: I really need this functionality.

262
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,822
Speaker 0: I know that that was all one sentence a Winner.

263
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:33,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he's almost as big a winner as the purse snatcher.

264
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:40,320
Speaker 0: I gotta say there are a lot of bad coders out there that seem to just copy stuff from other programs and clutch it together.

265
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:43,780
Speaker 1: You mean like all the people who barely made it through?

266
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:51,795
Speaker 1: You know like RIT the people who are like scraping together their projects and everything Yeah, or all the people in their cs4 class this year who cheated.

267
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:54,003
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, I heard that story.

268
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:54,425
Speaker 1: Yeah.

269
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:56,211
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't get it.

270
00:17:56,251 --> 00:18:05,991
Speaker 0: people cheat at RIT on a CS class And at RIT the way they do it is if you're caught cheating the minimum punishment is an automatic act And often they suspend or expel you.

271
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:07,298
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what they should do.

272
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:14,268
Speaker 1: Yep, but I mean it's so obvious to any student looking at another student Like that guy actually knows what he's doing.

273
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:19,184
Speaker 1: That guy is just doing the work and getting through, you know It's just obvious.

274
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:26,371
Speaker 1: there you don't even need to like I'm pretty sure it's obvious the professor's also But they have to give the grade based on the syllabus and whatever, you know, they do.

275
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:30,987
Speaker 1: but when it's so obvious You should just be like look seriously.

276
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:31,852
Speaker 1: You don't belong here.

277
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:32,756
Speaker 1: You don't know what you're doing.

278
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,223
Speaker 1: You don't care You're not trying.

279
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:35,547
Speaker 1: I mean, come on.

280
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:39,540
Speaker 1: Why are you doing CS if you're if you're not and paying a billion dollars to go.

281
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:40,284
Speaker 1: All right, you know what?

282
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:42,939
Speaker 0: because then the retention rate would be even lower.

283
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:48,220
Speaker 1: Well, you just you know, you accept more people in the first place, but then even more of them will fail out.

284
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,920
Speaker 1: Well, you make the standards real high.

285
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:53,415
Speaker 0: That's why they keep wanting to build more dorms and everything because they can't.

286
00:18:53,455 --> 00:19:01,319
Speaker 0: they can't accept more people They can't fit them and even though half of them will fail out They got to hold them all their standards But then not enough people will go and they won't make enough money.

287
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:11,460
Speaker 1: You either have to raise the standards to make it really hard so that all kinds of awesome people come like You know at MIT and all those other high up schools or lower the standards and make it easier.

288
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:18,140
Speaker 1: You can't have it be hard with low standards or else you get these dumb people doing hard stuff and not succeeding.

289
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:28,580
Speaker 1: And you know what those people tend to give you money Yeah, but it'd be a lot better to have you know Other people to give you money who actually stay and keep giving and giving and giving and giving and giving and giving.

290
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:34,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but remember it costs a lot more per student to take care of upperclassmen in college than it does for freshmen.

291
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:39,600
Speaker 1: Well, it's almost nothing to take care of lots and lots of upperclassmen doing lots and lots of expensive things.

292
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:44,239
Speaker 1: You can afford to even more dorms for even more fodder freshmen who will go out?

293
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there's not a lot of stuff at least in IT research money at least in IT.

294
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,639
Speaker 0: You know the biggest major on campus they there's not so much useful research coming out of there.

295
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:54,968
Speaker 1: See, that's the other thing.

296
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:56,839
Speaker 1: is you got to actually have some useful research.

297
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:00,700
Speaker 0: There's not so much useful IT research that universities can really do anymore.

298
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:04,012
Speaker 1: There's plenty of stuff that can still be done.

299
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,766
Speaker 0: this stuff being done even today Oh, yeah, but a lot of it's not.

300
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:08,112
Speaker 0: no one cares about it.

301
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:11,225
Speaker 0: and even companies that are looking for technology Don't care about new fields.

302
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:15,280
Speaker 0: They don't care about things like ipv6 or high bandwidth carrier lines.

303
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:18,473
Speaker 0: Most company you're still happy with their freaking t1 and their net.

304
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:25,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not about companies It's about getting research money from like, you know, the National Science whatever is that money's drying up?

305
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:31,700
Speaker 1: Yeah You know money is drying up which means fighting for it is even, you know more competitive.

306
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:39,420
Speaker 1: So you really have to put up a fight or you're gonna get or just accept a bunch of students and get a whole bunch Of money from then instead, but then that's not a good long-term plan.

307
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,304
Speaker 1: That's just what I'm saying.

308
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,717
Speaker 1: is it works, but it's not a good long-term plan in the long term.

309
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:43,180
Speaker 1: That'll fail.

310
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:43,943
Speaker 0: I don't know though.

311
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:47,819
Speaker 0: It's been working for a long time and it's slowly slowly not working as well.

312
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:48,685
Speaker 0: I don't know.

313
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:51,040
Speaker 0: The attention rate isn't getting worse is staying about the same.

314
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:53,146
Speaker 1: Yeah, people are getting dumber.

315
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:54,833
Speaker 1: It's gonna hurt him now.

316
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,159
Speaker 0: They'll just dumb their all the classes down.

317
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:57,490
Speaker 1: They don't.

318
00:20:57,511 --> 00:20:58,039
Speaker 1: that's what I said.

319
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,304
Speaker 1: They have to make it easier.

320
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:03,339
Speaker 0: if you gonna have low acceptance or what they could do is make all these easy.

321
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:09,180
Speaker 0: Oh if they want to be evil make all the class is easy Until the senior year and then suddenly they get really difficult.

322
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,955
Speaker 0: So only the really smart people pass and all the other people just got suckered into spending a hundred grand on nothing.

323
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,283
Speaker 1: I Guess you could.

324
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:17,046
Speaker 0: I could see him doing that.

325
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,055
Speaker 1: I don't know how that would profit for them.

326
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:20,200
Speaker 0: How would it not profit him?

327
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:21,983
Speaker 1: I just don't.

328
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:24,493
Speaker 1: what's the point of not giving you someone one more year?

329
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:30,094
Speaker 0: you get one more year money out of them because Then people will say oh our IT grads are crap because they would be.

330
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:32,700
Speaker 1: a lot of them are Yeah.

331
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:43,280
Speaker 0: But I've learned kind of scarily enough in my job workings that People from other like people who go to get learn IT or CS from a school that doesn't specialize in IT or CS.

332
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:44,925
Speaker 0: No offense to anyone out there.

333
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:46,469
Speaker 0: They often are terrible.

334
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:52,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is is like it's so random That you know people just don't.

335
00:21:52,590 --> 00:22:00,740
Speaker 1: basically just don't trust college graduates, you know They only want to look at all kinds of other stuff They like some people would go to like a community college, right?

336
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:08,720
Speaker 1: And little do you know that that community college had like one genius CS professor teacher of awesome and all his students learned amazing things.

337
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:18,739
Speaker 1: But you know at some really awesome college you can get through by slacking off, you know 99% of college graduate guys who come to you they all suck.

338
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:21,911
Speaker 0: Well, I think a lot of that is that people trust any of.

339
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:26,711
Speaker 0: a lot of people in college don't have any real-world Experience and really can't live on their own.

340
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:36,433
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's another problem That comes from even before in the high school days that I don't know into now like all the kids I remember from college whose parents visit him every weekend or every weekend.

341
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:38,260
Speaker 0: They drove back home to be with their family.

342
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:48,619
Speaker 0: Yeah Those kids need I knew one girl who her mom came and did her lot like took her laundry and did it and brought her Food so she wouldn't have to go shopping or eating the deed in the cafeteria with anyone.

343
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, a little problem.

344
00:22:51,006 --> 00:22:54,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, she failed out after a couple years expected.

345
00:22:54,965 --> 00:23:02,240
Speaker 1: alright, so There's this guy and he has a let's see 12 satellite dishes on his front porch.

346
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:07,719
Speaker 1: That's dumb and he's getting five thousand different radio and TV stations with it.

347
00:23:08,661 --> 00:23:13,375
Speaker 0: Alright, so he's getting more media than he can possibly consume and he's going about to buy his 13th dish.

348
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:15,160
Speaker 0: I think he's obsessed.

349
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,593
Speaker 1: He's a 54 year old former ice cream salesman.

350
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,379
Speaker 1: I Think he's got a little problem.

351
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:29,788
Speaker 1: Okay, unless he has let's see 12 TiVo's I Don't think he's watching as much as he can watch.

352
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:31,154
Speaker 0: What was that statistic?

353
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:32,760
Speaker 0: that more porn is made.

354
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,634
Speaker 0: There is more than an hour's worth of porn made every hour in the world.

355
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:38,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about right.

356
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it is physically impossible to watch all of the pornography that has been created.

357
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:48,093
Speaker 1: You could have multiple televisions and watch multiple porn simultaneously.

358
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then you're multitasking.

359
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:52,838
Speaker 1: Hey if you had two penises.

360
00:23:54,202 --> 00:24:04,620
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, though speaking of porn this guy in Utah Ralph Yarrow Wants to standardize like remember how when they wanted to make an xxx domain and all the porn in there

361
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,380
Speaker 1: The xxx domain it would make it easier for people who want porn to find it and not easily block anyone who didn't know.

362
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,213
Speaker 0: I disagree with it because one would you make a law saying porn has to go there?

363
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:16,220
Speaker 0: Yes, what's porn?

364
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:19,631
Speaker 0: How do you define pornography would have?

365
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:21,259
Speaker 0: what a site about mammograms go there?

366
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:23,291
Speaker 0: What about something you just disagree with?

367
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,820
Speaker 0: what about a girl in a short skirt?

368
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,034
Speaker 0: Some people are offended by people who don't wear a vane.

369
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:29,444
Speaker 1: it is in the place You are.

370
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:31,759
Speaker 0: any if you all right, so then does he realize that?

371
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:40,594
Speaker 0: If you're in Utah, all right, all the porn from Utah is in xxx, but then in Southern, California There's a bunch of stuff that you would consider porn.

372
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:41,419
Speaker 0: That's not an xxx.

373
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:56,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if I was in California and a site was let's say normally something.com right, but in Utah that was considered porn I would have to go to something that That's not workable at all.

374
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,392
Speaker 1: Why not one?

375
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,520
Speaker 0: we are you gonna make it every who decides?

376
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,163
Speaker 0: What's porn?

377
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:08,240
Speaker 0: so someone who has a website say I'm in I'm in Southern, California, and they don't care about it, and I have a porn site and it's something calm.

378
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:11,880
Speaker 0: You're saying I have to buy an xxx specifically for other places.

379
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,720
Speaker 1: No, it's up to the other places to put you in xxx in their place.

380
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,123
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

381
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:18,218
Speaker 0: put you or the other places put you in xxx as?

382
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,639
Speaker 0: In it is it basically you want them to give you a free domain?

383
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,601
Speaker 1: No, it's.

384
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:30,860
Speaker 1: if they want to make me xxx in their state then they have to take calm and make it xxx.

385
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,085
Speaker 0: You can't do that.

386
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:32,547
Speaker 1: Why not?

387
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,254
Speaker 0: That's not how it works Scott.

388
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:35,520
Speaker 0: That's not how DNS works.

389
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:37,004
Speaker 1: That's tough.

390
00:25:37,748 --> 00:25:38,433
Speaker 0: there's really there's.

391
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:38,654
Speaker 1: I do it.

392
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:39,480
Speaker 1: that way you can do it.

393
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no technical way to do it.

394
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:41,307
Speaker 0: plus.

395
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:44,500
Speaker 0: I there would still be besides if you did that all right fine.

396
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,404
Speaker 0: So it routes it.

397
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:47,453
Speaker 0: see if you go dot xxx takes you calm.

398
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:51,622
Speaker 0: the calm would still work Mmm.

399
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:55,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think you understand how DNS works because that is an absolutely impossible thing to do.

400
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:58,028
Speaker 1: No, maybe we should upgrade to have PVC.

401
00:25:58,248 --> 00:25:59,894
Speaker 0: that that still there's no way to.

402
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,063
Speaker 0: that is nothing to do with DNS at all You realize.

403
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,860
Speaker 1: yeah, how about just people who consider themselves to be poor?

404
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:09,835
Speaker 1: I mean people who are porn sites want it because it'll make people find them easier.

405
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:12,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they'll also keep their comms Don't?

406
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:20,779
Speaker 0: the only people who've advocated for this seriously are people who think they can make laws that'll force all porn to be on xxx and nowhere else under penalty of law.

407
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:25,023
Speaker 0: That way they can block xxx Define porn.

408
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:29,340
Speaker 1: it would work, but you know you can't with my standards for porn in different places.

409
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,072
Speaker 0: You know yeah, hence.

410
00:26:31,153 --> 00:26:32,120
Speaker 0: It's an unworkable idea.

411
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,559
Speaker 1: You know it would be workable if you let me decide what was porn and what wasn't cuz I could decide pretty easily.

412
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,001
Speaker 1: That's just like this naked It's.

413
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:44,960
Speaker 1: it's basically hey our guys gonna look or guys or girls gonna look at this for the purpose of getting it off.

414
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,433
Speaker 0: Yes, no, but so why should porn have its own domain?

415
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:50,400
Speaker 1: Why is porn special to make it easier to find?

416
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:55,206
Speaker 0: Google It's still You know it.

417
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,477
Speaker 1: It's still not easy to find.

418
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:58,180
Speaker 0: pull anyway.

419
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:02,811
Speaker 0: This guy has about the same understanding of ports as you do of DNS.

420
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:06,200
Speaker 0: apparently he wants there to be a porn ports.

421
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:18,994
Speaker 0: Apparently he found out that there's sixty five thousand five hundred and thirty five ports on a computer that you access the interwebs with and Apparently he figured that right now everything comes in through this one port.

422
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:21,701
Speaker 0: It's like a channel channel 80.

423
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:24,853
Speaker 0: Why is porn coming in the same channel as kids entertainment?

424
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:26,500
Speaker 0: There should be a separate channel for porn.

425
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:28,212
Speaker 0: There's sixty five thousand channels.

426
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:29,259
Speaker 0: most of them are being used.

427
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:32,640
Speaker 0: We should set up a channel for porn channel for education channel for blah blah blah.

428
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:40,042
Speaker 0: In other words this guy has probably got the least understanding of internet architecture of anyone I've ever.

429
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:41,346
Speaker 1: what hurt us.

430
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:48,525
Speaker 1: what we could do is we could have all web servers serving porn sites run on port 8,000 instead of 80.

431
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:52,998
Speaker 0: you realize that's also silly I know, but that's what he wants right.

432
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,365
Speaker 0: yeah He calls his initiative CP 80 or clean port 80.

433
00:27:58,365 --> 00:28:00,485
Speaker 1: He is Stupid.

434
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:03,217
Speaker 1: he does not know about IP quote.

435
00:28:04,301 --> 00:28:09,420
Speaker 0: So why aren't more of the sixty five thousand plus ports being used for content their plight?

436
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,239
Speaker 0: There's a plentiful amount of channels out there.

437
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:14,376
Speaker 0: Why are we not making adult content and assigning it to its own channel?

438
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:15,160
Speaker 0: doesn't that make sense?

439
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,713
Speaker 1: No, because the ports aren't channels now.

440
00:28:18,974 --> 00:28:23,159
Speaker 1: That's not a synonymous analogy analogous thing.

441
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:36,000
Speaker 0: Congruity yep equality Plus the fact that most corporate firewalls block everything, but port 80 anyway and Almost every bad thing in the world has been made to just proxy through port 80.

442
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,340
Speaker 1: Yes, the thing is some people manage their corporate firewalls really well.

443
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,709
Speaker 1: They say your company doesn't my company does not.

444
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:48,049
Speaker 1: but most companies say anything can go out Nothing can come in.

445
00:28:48,574 --> 00:28:48,735
Speaker 0: yeah.

446
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:51,211
Speaker 1: I gotta say That's the only setting you need.

447
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:52,759
Speaker 1: anything can go out nothing come in.

448
00:28:53,822 --> 00:28:54,947
Speaker 0: What about servers you have?

449
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:57,579
Speaker 1: if you have a server you put it in the DMZ?

450
00:28:58,941 --> 00:29:01,413
Speaker 0: All right, what if you want to dial in?

451
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:02,618
Speaker 0: got a VPN set up?

452
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:05,171
Speaker 1: You have a little separate.

453
00:29:05,634 --> 00:29:12,239
Speaker 0: you know VPN And I assume you mean stateful because if you just set up if you set up access list where anything go out nothing come in.

454
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:21,796
Speaker 0: Nothing could get out either because you'd send a ping out and the reply would never get back to you, but you know no Incoming requests for connection you know?

455
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:26,438
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, I can take to a web server, and then it sends me back the web page.

456
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:26,980
Speaker 1: it gets better.

457
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,591
Speaker 1: He gets through.

458
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:31,373
Speaker 0: yeah You realize that's pretty much if you set up a like a pick Cisco firewall.

459
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:34,233
Speaker 0: if you do it the basic way That's the default.

460
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:34,720
Speaker 0: yeah.

461
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:39,760
Speaker 0: And the only way you'll have a crap your corporate firewalls if you go out of your way to make it bad.

462
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:45,100
Speaker 1: Basically they went out of their way to basically do a bunch of hacky stuff to make a bunch of these weird proprietary things.

463
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:48,366
Speaker 1: They've got do weird stuff And it basically screws everything up.

464
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:52,300
Speaker 0: that sounds really dubious to me because there aren't many things that do weird things using ports.

465
00:29:52,603 --> 00:29:55,805
Speaker 1: They use just crazy Freaking weird software isn't there?

466
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:57,190
Speaker 1: not a hundred percent awesome?

467
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:01,711
Speaker 1: if you came in there you could clean it up probably real easily because seriously I don't even need to know what the application is.

468
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:04,468
Speaker 0: you want something to go through a firewall And you don't know anything about it.

469
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,360
Speaker 0: run it run ethereal.

470
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:09,409
Speaker 1: The firewall is this sonic wall thing.

471
00:30:09,449 --> 00:30:10,051
Speaker 1: It's basically.

472
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:11,916
Speaker 1: There's a piece of software called sonic wall.

473
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:18,116
Speaker 0: ah but they oh God if you want to run a firewall you buy a router and you put access on.

474
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:19,120
Speaker 1: so they bought this thing.

475
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,385
Speaker 1: It's a sonic wall firewall.

476
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:23,358
Speaker 1: It's basically this piece of hardware that runs this software.

477
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:24,563
Speaker 1: right it's as if you.

478
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:25,929
Speaker 1: it's like kind of like the Google box.

479
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:42,406
Speaker 1: only it runs this firewall software and It has a web interface and everything like that And they just tinker with this thing and it does all kinds of things that firewalls aren't supposed to do Like you can block porn with it even though they turn that off after it basically blocked every internet site There was all

480
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:46,322
Speaker 0: right, so this sounds like a kludgy slow Terrible thing.

481
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:47,225
Speaker 1: it's not slow.

482
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:50,214
Speaker 1: It's just misconfigured because the people handling it aren't perfect.

483
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:50,555
Speaker 1: awesome.

484
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,280
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, but how does it block porn?

485
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:54,683
Speaker 1: It looks.

486
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,429
Speaker 0: if it looks at the content does it?

487
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,220
Speaker 0: do you mean it takes apart the HTV and looks for like keywords?

488
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,967
Speaker 1: If you turn that feature on yeah, it looks for.

489
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,271
Speaker 0: you know how slow that is.

490
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,375
Speaker 1: yeah, it's slow.

491
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:09,471
Speaker 1: if you turn that on yeah This thing isn't great trust me, but it's not so.

492
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:11,900
Speaker 1: the thing could be great if they didn't mess it up.

493
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:13,367
Speaker 1: Well, it wouldn't be great.

494
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,720
Speaker 1: It would be a normal perfectly normal firewall.

495
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,131
Speaker 0: Well, my consulting rate is $75 an hour.

496
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:19,115
Speaker 0: if they want me to fix everything.

497
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:20,160
Speaker 1: They don't want you to fix everything.

498
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,218
Speaker 1: They think everything's working.

499
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:26,566
Speaker 1: Alright Alright, so here's an awesome thing.

500
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:27,629
Speaker 1: This is pretty awesome.

501
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:28,552
Speaker 0: This is your thing of the day.

502
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:41,360
Speaker 1: No what alright, so There's a game called Call of Duty 2. it's a. it's an army game right alright and as the case with many Multiplayer online type games the users are complaining.

503
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:42,864
Speaker 0: What are they complaining about?

504
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:49,140
Speaker 1: their number one complaint is legitimate in that the developers have not made any sort of anti-cheat anything?

505
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,327
Speaker 1: So cheating is basically rampant.

506
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,960
Speaker 0: alright like counter-strike was for most of his existence.

507
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,300
Speaker 1: I counted right goes for most of his existence except now.

508
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,148
Speaker 1: I think they do have a reasonable expectation that there should be anti cheating systems Because most big games do right.

509
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,961
Speaker 0: Yeah, though there are ways around that you just only play with people You know.

510
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:06,563
Speaker 0: or like.

511
00:32:06,604 --> 00:32:16,831
Speaker 0: the clan of the fossil rockers was good back in the day when back when people cheated just completely and There was no way to stop them there was this clan where pretty much all the only people are in.

512
00:32:16,872 --> 00:32:21,021
Speaker 0: it were cool people and cool people recommended by cool people and The.

513
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:24,800
Speaker 0: all their servers were password protected and you were guaranteed to get a good game if you went to one of their servers.

514
00:32:25,162 --> 00:32:29,160
Speaker 1: Well, that's cool, but these people have found a I think an okay solution.

515
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,876
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what I think about it yet, but they're gonna have.

516
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:37,580
Speaker 1: oh All of the servers that are in on it are going to strike.

517
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:42,774
Speaker 1: It's not a game like World of Warcraft where Blizzard run where the developer runs the servers.

518
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:45,779
Speaker 1: this it's like counter-strike where the servers are all run by users.

519
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:58,039
Speaker 1: So a bunch of the servers in fact a very very large portion of them are just gonna keep their servers on But change them to say they're on strike and not allow any users to use them.

520
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:04,540
Speaker 1: So when people log in to play the game They're gonna see this list of servers that all say on strike with no one playing.

521
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:07,873
Speaker 0: That's a good idea because I gotta say I've learned that it

522
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:09,540
Speaker 1: basically destroys the game

523
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:24,419
Speaker 0: Especially since that'll really work well just because it seems to be that the people the types of people who run servers for games like that Tend to be the type of people that organize themselves and they all seem to know each other pretty well And it's real easy to spread the word about something like that.

524
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:44,578
Speaker 1: Yep, so they're gonna shut down all the servers for 24 hours and hopefully that will encourage the developers and the people who run the game and publisher or whatever to Develop an anti-cheat system and meet some other demands or else their game is gonna be Pretty poopy as anyone who tries to play it from now on won't have a server to go to.

525
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:50,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, basically like either you make your game better or will kill your game and you won't make any more money off of it.

526
00:33:51,423 --> 00:33:52,771
Speaker 0: Well, I wish them the best of luck.

527
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:57,698
Speaker 0: Yeah way to go thing of the day.

528
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:06,488
Speaker 0: Okay thing of the day thing of the day Thing of the day is my thing.

529
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:07,351
Speaker 0: What's your thing?

530
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:08,695
Speaker 1: So I saw this.

531
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:09,437
Speaker 1: it's pretty funny.

532
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:11,789
Speaker 1: it today Wasn't really that exciting.

533
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,514
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't.

534
00:34:12,574 --> 00:34:13,239
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

535
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,739
Speaker 1: So so people make fun of the family circus, which isn't hard to make fun of.

536
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:21,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean honestly and I'm not one to say something's objectively bad.

537
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:32,380
Speaker 0: But family circus as a comic or as literature or as a waste of ink on paper is Probably the worst like least entertaining thing I've ever experienced.

538
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:34,628
Speaker 1: I must say I mildly enjoy that.

539
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:36,054
Speaker 0: I was shot at once.

540
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:42,420
Speaker 1: so I must say though I do mildly enjoy the family circuses with the dotted line and he runs around the yard and stuff.

541
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,879
Speaker 0: Oh, I enjoyed it once the first time it was done.

542
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:53,159
Speaker 1: Well, it's because in those at least you can look at all the interesting little like funny things that he does Along the line like oh look he jumped over the pool.

543
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:58,440
Speaker 0: I never thought I'd be in a position where where you mister everything is crap was defending family sir.

544
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,396
Speaker 1: No, no, all the rest of family circus is pretty much ninety nine nine nine percent crap.

545
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:03,320
Speaker 0: You defended a little bit.

546
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,953
Speaker 0: It's like saying yeah, Hitler was a bastard, but he didn't personally kill a baby.

547
00:35:08,013 --> 00:35:08,495
Speaker 1: Well, he was.

548
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:09,939
Speaker 1: he was evil, but he was smart.

549
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:16,476
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, he Stalin was paranoid, but he stayed in power long.

550
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:17,178
Speaker 1: Oh god.

551
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:21,772
Speaker 0: I heard this Wasn't really a joke the other day was just a Something but someone was talking.

552
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:23,160
Speaker 0: They're like, what if Hitler?

553
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:31,528
Speaker 0: Actually went to art school and graduated and became a mass murderer anyway And someone else was like it'd be even worse.

554
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:34,537
Speaker 0: It would have been a more protest slightly more pretentious Hitler.

555
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:45,842
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so anyway, someone remixed the family circus with a good buddy HP Lovecraft Cthulhu photography Really?

556
00:35:45,862 --> 00:35:46,544
Speaker 0: Ah, really?

557
00:35:46,564 --> 00:35:47,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's pretty funny.

558
00:35:47,868 --> 00:35:48,329
Speaker 1: You got these.

559
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,854
Speaker 1: you get these comics named.

560
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:50,396
Speaker 1: Let's see.

561
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,820
Speaker 1: This one's named Mughal.

562
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:55,828
Speaker 0: Ooh, I see one named photography and then one named photography.

563
00:35:58,274 --> 00:35:58,655
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

564
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:00,520
Speaker 1: Okay, the site was a little broken there for a second.

565
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:02,105
Speaker 1: Hey, here's one called bomber.

566
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:03,088
Speaker 1: I can't pass that.

567
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:11,135
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's a picture of the dad in the car with the little girl Next to him and the girl is like rubbing her eye and you see her eyes are closed.

568
00:36:11,195 --> 00:36:12,360
Speaker 1: She seems kind of like oh.

569
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:29,091
Speaker 1: And it says amidst a blinding glare of descending fire the voice of heaven resounded with the blasphemies of hell and the mingling agony of all the lost Reverberated in one apocalyptic planet rendering peel of cyclopean din.

570
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:29,853
Speaker 0: Yeah.

571
00:36:30,093 --> 00:36:43,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could do loop a target and the girls like Sorrow you know, it makes me very happy that HP Lovecraft work have gained such a Foothold in geek culture.

572
00:36:43,346 --> 00:36:45,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't even know who he was before I went to college.

573
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:48,219
Speaker 1: really I guess my mom never even heard of it.

574
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,735
Speaker 0: My mother was really into horror writing and science like dark science fiction type writing.

575
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:53,915
Speaker 0: like.

576
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:55,929
Speaker 0: she was fan of Stephen King and all those people.

577
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:58,085
Speaker 0: But she was rich.

578
00:36:58,106 --> 00:37:00,593
Speaker 0: She always loved HP Lovecraft and at a very young age.

579
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:10,008
Speaker 0: She gave me tales of horror in the macabre And I was hooked on Cthulhu from a very young age never even heard of it until Wow, you even know what it was.

580
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,798
Speaker 1: and then people were like Lovecraft.

581
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:13,299
Speaker 1: Cthulhu I'm like, what the hell you talking about?

582
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:22,629
Speaker 0: But I mean it's got to the point where every gaming store that has even any sort of respectability has multiple Cthulhu Related dolls or plushies.

583
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,371
Speaker 0: That's cuz.

584
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:24,355
Speaker 1: there's that Cthulhu game.

585
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,244
Speaker 1: There's multiple Cthulhu, you know, yeah It's cool.

586
00:37:27,526 --> 00:37:31,944
Speaker 0: Yeah, we actually played the Cthulhu real playing game once Did a little one-off.

587
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,371
Speaker 1: Oh, well, we did also play pokey through.

588
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,220
Speaker 0: now pokey through that game was fantastic.

589
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:40,812
Speaker 0: It was Pokemon plus Cthulhu.

590
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,582
Speaker 0: no more need be said I Liked it.

591
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:44,892
Speaker 1: I think I'd like to play it again.

592
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,360
Speaker 0: Ah All right.

593
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,504
Speaker 0: so my thing of the day.

594
00:37:47,524 --> 00:37:54,879
Speaker 0: remember a long time ago super they had this car that had like this magic suspension with solenoids that Would like make it go over potholes or over stuff.

595
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:56,164
Speaker 1: Well, it basically didn't.

596
00:37:56,585 --> 00:38:05,459
Speaker 1: basically shove the tires into holes and made other tires go up If the other tires were gonna hit a bump and it kept the car as level as could be done.

597
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:07,729
Speaker 0: Yep Well, it's back and it's badass.

598
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:16,683
Speaker 0: now Bo's made a system That's like that only a thousand times better and they're gonna put it in some new like luxury Lexus cars Eventually.

599
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:18,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, why are they putting it in this luxury car?

600
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,979
Speaker 1: So you need because it cost five thousand dollars.

601
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:23,287
Speaker 1: Okay, but why don't you put it in a race car?

602
00:38:23,307 --> 00:38:24,471
Speaker 0: I don't know.

603
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,478
Speaker 0: I think it takes a lot of power.

604
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,069
Speaker 0: I think it actually hurts the gas mileage.

605
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:29,993
Speaker 1: Oh, does it hurt?

606
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:31,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's not a lot.

607
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,720
Speaker 1: But if you're in a race car that's not worried about gas mileage like a rally car doesn't need to worry about gas.

608
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:37,634
Speaker 1: It just goes down the hill once or twice, you know.

609
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:37,816
Speaker 0: Yeah.

610
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:38,380
Speaker 0: Well, it depends.

611
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:47,188
Speaker 0: I mean there's not much information yet but they've got pictures and apparently this car will drive over a two by six piece of wood and Various other bits of debris.

612
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:49,480
Speaker 0: without it like the driver won't even notice.

613
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could run over a small child.

614
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:52,954
Speaker 1: not even that would definitely help out.

615
00:38:53,074 --> 00:39:02,771
Speaker 1: I think monster trucks It would help out motorcycles that drive it like a motocross type things that drive in the dirt Yeah, yeah max type motocross type things.

616
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:10,456
Speaker 0: and it would help out rally cars huge Rally, it'll help out drivers in Rochester Buffalo and Detroit, you know aka pothole cities.

617
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll help them out.

618
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:25,000
Speaker 0: I don't think it'll help out someone like Formula One or NASCAR No, but in Formula One they could drive over that a red and white bit at the edge without going butter butter butter butter butter Maybe.

619
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:26,083
Speaker 1: Somehow.

620
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:27,170
Speaker 1: I don't think it doesn't matter.

621
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:31,900
Speaker 0: that doesn't really slow them down Man, they should just bring back the vacuum cars.

622
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:35,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, so everyone can die again, yeah, but you know what.

623
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:36,694
Speaker 0: that's the risk you take.

624
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:38,260
Speaker 0: you got a super license you're rich.

625
00:39:38,863 --> 00:39:44,640
Speaker 1: It's called first of all, the cars are called ground effects and second of all People stopped driving them because they were so dangerous.

626
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:51,412
Speaker 1: What they need to do is make the car as fast as it can be Where they can still find someone who's willing to drive it who's good.

627
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,399
Speaker 1: I mean, they can always be crazy.

628
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:56,980
Speaker 0: I was about to say yeah, you can find anyone to do just about anything.

629
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,640
Speaker 0: The problem is finding someone to do anything.

630
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:05,208
Speaker 1: Basically what they do is they just take the current racers and if the current racer says this car is too fast I won't drive it then it's too fast.

631
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:05,972
Speaker 1: They won't drive it.

632
00:40:06,374 --> 00:40:10,969
Speaker 1: if the car is you know Not fast enough then they'll say it's yes, this isn't.

633
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,940
Speaker 0: even Schumacher lately is like yeah, the cars are too slow.

634
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:18,860
Speaker 1: Well, it's it's like they're you know, one guy says yeah, the cars are too fast.

635
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,960
Speaker 1: Another guy says no the cars are too slow.

636
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,713
Speaker 1: Well, it's all because one guy can handle it.

637
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:24,979
Speaker 1: one guy can't you know?

638
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:33,593
Speaker 1: They have some people get in these things and there were a lot of people complain that with all the technology that goes into them That it basically driving Formula One is like a video game.

639
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:34,457
Speaker 1: Anyone can do it.

640
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:38,307
Speaker 1: Whatever Meanwhile people who test drive these things like damn that's too fast.

641
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:38,969
Speaker 1: I can't drive that.

642
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:45,569
Speaker 1: Oh my god You know, it's just the literal speed and acceleration of the car is more than people can handle.

643
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:49,205
Speaker 1: It's like a feet Like what you need.

644
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:50,953
Speaker 1: do you need to wait until you get like five levels?

645
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:52,019
Speaker 1: you get another feet drive f1.

646
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:56,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I can imagine cuz I when I was real young I went to a space camp.

647
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:02,060
Speaker 0: Actually, I went to space Academy because I was a little too old for space camp and we got to go in the gravity simulator.

648
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:02,865
Speaker 0: You know the thing.

649
00:41:02,885 --> 00:41:04,395
Speaker 0: they spin you around you make funny faces.

650
00:41:04,415 --> 00:41:08,729
Speaker 0: Yep, and Up around five six G's.

651
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:11,360
Speaker 0: it's real hard to do anything.

652
00:41:12,282 --> 00:41:15,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know f1 is basically like you go into a turn.

653
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,870
Speaker 1: It's five G's at your back and then it's your canes.

654
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,480
Speaker 1: you turn left real quick and it's five G's in the other direction.

655
00:41:20,762 --> 00:41:22,999
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, you know, it's pretty crazy.

656
00:41:23,662 --> 00:41:28,979
Speaker 1: Multiple G's changing all the time as you turn speed up slow down.

657
00:41:29,842 --> 00:41:34,800
Speaker 0: Though there is one thing that is actually harder and more G's than that, you know flying a fighter jet.

658
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:35,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were.

659
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,599
Speaker 1: they actually mentioned fighter jets on this f1.

660
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:40,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the difference is the reason I found.

661
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,792
Speaker 0: I know the reason.

662
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,960
Speaker 1: fighter jets don't just pass out immediately That don't they have like suits and thing.

663
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:53,340
Speaker 0: But what the flight suit does is it actually puts pressure on the body Like on the abdomen to keep the blood from spilling out of the head and into the abdomen.

664
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:55,528
Speaker 0: So the blood stays in the brain and you stay conscious.

665
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:56,672
Speaker 1: Yes, that's good.

666
00:41:56,853 --> 00:41:59,787
Speaker 0: It squeezes your real hard All right.

667
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:01,480
Speaker 0: It's actually kind of painful.

668
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,220
Speaker 0: I didn't actually get to do it, but I got to wear a flight suit as part of a cool thing.

669
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,521
Speaker 0: We did.

670
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,345
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

671
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:06,927
Speaker 0: You know what?

672
00:42:06,947 --> 00:42:07,449
Speaker 0: It sucks.

673
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:09,156
Speaker 0: Don't ever fly a fighter jet.

674
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:10,040
Speaker 0: It's it it sucks.

675
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:19,371
Speaker 1: You know once I saw this lady who was like the morning talk show TV lady fly like an f-15 and She seemed to be having a good time.

676
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:21,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you just fly it around I mean fighter jets.

677
00:42:21,965 --> 00:42:28,240
Speaker 0: modern fighter jets are so computer-controlled that other than Landing pretty much an idiot could fly them.

678
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:29,726
Speaker 1: You see that's what they were talking about with f1.

679
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:32,056
Speaker 1: is is that's why they compared it to the fighter jet?

680
00:42:32,076 --> 00:42:40,332
Speaker 1: because people complained When they were getting too computer-controlled and too easy to drive but the reality was no It's even though it might seem like that.

681
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:52,307
Speaker 0: It's really hard Yep, but the thing is it's easy to fly a fighter jet in a straight line or to do a little turn But if you're actually fighting or flying hard, you'll just pass out and die Probably unless you're trained.

682
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:54,418
Speaker 1: Yep, unless you spend a lot of time in this.

683
00:42:54,498 --> 00:42:59,379
Speaker 0: in course It's not like the US military has ever really fought against anyone else who had fighter jets.

684
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:04,112
Speaker 0: Not since the Korean War makes yeah in the Korean War.

685
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,899
Speaker 0: That was the last time our Air Force engaged another Air Force.

686
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:13,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is Air Force is really aren't designed to take on Air Forces so much or fighter I have to take on other Forces.

687
00:43:13,962 --> 00:43:18,840
Speaker 0: fighter jets exist should be pretty much purely for air superiority to make sure that no one else has anything in the sky.

688
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:20,187
Speaker 1: Well, I mean that's the thing is though.

689
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:22,680
Speaker 1: Why why would you even put a plane in the sky in the first place?

690
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:29,696
Speaker 1: Well, it's not to blow up another plane because if your planes are only to blow up other planes and that's it Just no one puts any planes up.

691
00:43:30,664 --> 00:43:32,980
Speaker 0: Well, that's why you have multiple kinds of the bombers, right?

692
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:37,900
Speaker 1: The only the real goal is to have the bomber succeed in bombing something.

693
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's what the bomber doesn't get blowed up by.

694
00:43:41,524 --> 00:43:42,108
Speaker 0: You do realize.

695
00:43:42,129 --> 00:43:43,540
Speaker 0: that's what air superiority is.

696
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,580
Speaker 0: All it means is you have fighter jets up that ensure that no one else can take off a fighter jet.

697
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:50,260
Speaker 0: Thus no one else can take off anything.

698
00:43:50,512 --> 00:43:53,133
Speaker 1: Yeah but a little a on the ground takes out the whole thing.

699
00:43:53,575 --> 00:44:00,179
Speaker 0: actually know because Our technology is so advanced that any country we've ever fought didn't even have effective a a.

700
00:44:00,822 --> 00:44:02,269
Speaker 1: But I mean a a is so cheap.

701
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:04,560
Speaker 1: you could just have so much of it that doesn't matter how techno.

702
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,504
Speaker 0: But it just doesn't work.

703
00:44:05,524 --> 00:44:06,790
Speaker 0: because you just cruise missile.

704
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,115
Speaker 1: it I guess.

705
00:44:08,196 --> 00:44:10,404
Speaker 1: but if you have a cruise missiles What do you need the bombers for?

706
00:44:10,725 --> 00:44:12,049
Speaker 0: because the bombers are more precision.

707
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,360
Speaker 0: cruise missiles are not as accurate as the media would like you to?

708
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:15,761
Speaker 0: Believe.

709
00:44:16,224 --> 00:44:17,471
Speaker 1: oh, they seem pretty accurate to me.

710
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:23,147
Speaker 0: They're really not a sieve - they're really Yeah, they don't miss.

711
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:25,573
Speaker 0: they never cause a civilian casualty ever.

712
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:26,656
Speaker 0: they just destroy.

713
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:31,660
Speaker 1: whatever unit you wanted to destroy Well destroys the topmost unit in the city because why would you put it anywhere, but a city?

714
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,140
Speaker 0: I used it to take out guys that were standing in front of cities, okay?

715
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,835
Speaker 0: If this I used it to take out.

716
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:37,380
Speaker 1: I need to be clear.

717
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:52,052
Speaker 0: I once used one to take out a transport full of troops that was going towards my capital And that was geek nights with rim and Scott special.

718
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:53,980
Speaker 0: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

719
00:44:54,846 --> 00:44:55,520
