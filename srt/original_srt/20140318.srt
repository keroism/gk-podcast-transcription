1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,505
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, March 18th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:15,055
Speaker 1: I'm Rym, and this is Geek Nights Tonight.

3
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,339
Speaker 1: It's a gaming news round-up.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,318
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,810
Speaker 1: Now that we're back to mostly regularly scheduled shows.

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:37,770
Speaker 1: Even though right before PAX, I think I'm going to Paris for that week, so suddenly there won't be shows again, but then there'll be shows after that.

7
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:40,530
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

8
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,094
Speaker 1: Hopefully convention season is very front-loaded.

9
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:46,499
Speaker 1: We have all these cons in March and April, and we basically have nothing until PAX Prime time.

10
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,942
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kineticon is like one con in, what, July?

11
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:58,150
Speaker 0: That's a ways out.

12
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,601
Speaker 0: August, July, something like that.

13
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:00,450
Speaker 0: May is empty.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,525
Speaker 1: Yeah, May and most of June are pretty empty.

15
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:03,110
Speaker 1: It's surprising.

16
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:10,549
Speaker 1: It's interesting watching how certain cons we've gone to have been migrating away from each other on the calendar every year.

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,530
Speaker 0: Well, everyone tries to dodge each other, and then they end up bumping into each other.

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, you bump into the other side.

19
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:20,930
Speaker 1: But anime Boston, at least, I remember there was the time they overlapped with PAX, which was no good.

20
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,381
Speaker 1: And then there was the year where they were opposite weekends, which was no good.

21
00:01:25,726 --> 00:01:26,530
Speaker 1: Well, no good for us.

22
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,590
Speaker 1: Basically, we have to either travel to Boston on alternating weekends, or live in Boston for a week.

23
00:01:34,013 --> 00:01:35,548
Speaker 1: Not cheap to live in Boston for a week.

24
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:39,005
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, we're back for now.

25
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:40,210
Speaker 1: All right.

26
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:40,948
Speaker 1: Guess we got some news.

27
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,549
Speaker 0: Do you have any opening bits of any kind?

28
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,632
Speaker 1: I don't know.

29
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:45,257
Speaker 1: This weekend I did a bunch of cool stuff.

30
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:45,980
Speaker 1: that's kind of secret.

31
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:47,785
Speaker 1: No skiing.

32
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:49,270
Speaker 1: Skiing season's almost over.

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:50,492
Speaker 0: Almost over.

34
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:53,250
Speaker 0: It's still cold, though, somehow, so if you make fake snow, it shouldn't melt.

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:01,170
Speaker 1: Actually, Hunter Mountain said that they're going to be open for 30 more days minimum, because they have so much snow.

36
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:01,770
Speaker 0: It's cold.

37
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,056
Speaker 1: What they do is they make big snow whales.

38
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:08,009
Speaker 1: They can kind of, like, flatten that snow out to keep extending extra snow, extra snow.

39
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,809
Speaker 1: And it keeps snowing up there, so whatevs.

40
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,370
Speaker 1: So, yeah, soon we'll stop talking about skiing and start talking a lot about biking.

41
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,895
Speaker 1: Like, "Hey, what'd you do this

42
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:16,256
Speaker 1: weekend?".

43
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,320
Speaker 1: "I biked to Rockaway

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,560
Speaker 1: again.".

45
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:18,363
Speaker 1: "Oh, yeah, I biked to

46
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:18,725
Speaker 1: Beacon.".

47
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:19,166
Speaker 1: "Oh, yeah,

48
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:19,668
Speaker 1: biking.".

49
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:19,989
Speaker 1: "Bike,

50
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:20,270
Speaker 1: bike.".

51
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:22,032
Speaker 1: "Couldn't bike

52
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:22,414
Speaker 1: today.".

53
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,738
Speaker 1: "Tried to bike today, but it

54
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,220
Speaker 1: rained.".

55
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:24,983
Speaker 1: "Oh, I biked

56
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:25,424
Speaker 1: anyway.".

57
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:26,347
Speaker 1: "Oh, bike, bike,

58
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:26,608
Speaker 1: bike.".

59
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,130
Speaker 1: That's going to be geek nights, just bike nights.

60
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,230
Speaker 0: Bike nights is good.

61
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:33,890
Speaker 1: Change the show to bike nights, talking about gear ratios.

62
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,068
Speaker 0: Good luck finding a biking podcast besides ours.

63
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:38,656
Speaker 1: Why fixies suck.

64
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:40,609
Speaker 1: Every episode is just complaining about fixies.

65
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:41,973
Speaker 0: Burn 'em all.

66
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:45,310
Speaker 0: If you're not in a velodrome, you should die.

67
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:55,850
Speaker 1: Though there is that crazy Kickstarter that I'm waiting for the first person to get arrested with this thing, but basically it's a little suitcase that you carry around.

68
00:02:56,311 --> 00:03:02,670
Speaker 1: And you stick it on the front of a city bike and it turns it into a friction drive electric bike.

69
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:07,950
Speaker 1: It's basically a car battery and a motor and a little wheel that'll drive the bike along for you.

70
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,321
Speaker 0: There's a Kickstarter I saw today for a shelf, basically.

71
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:12,184
Speaker 0: It's one of those shelves.

72
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:13,890
Speaker 0: that's basically a box that you stick on the wall.

73
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,980
Speaker 0: But you can basically hang your bike from it by the seat.

74
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:21,310
Speaker 0: And you put your helmet in the box.

75
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,830
Speaker 1: Oh, I can envision how that would work.

76
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,750
Speaker 0: And then you can work on the bike while it's sort of hanging there by the seat.

77
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,270
Speaker 1: That is the thing that I, you know, I love living in New York.

78
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:30,955
Speaker 0: But you know what?

79
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,550
Speaker 0: Guess how much this thing costs on Kickstarter.

80
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,869
Speaker 1: Alright, I'm not having seen it.

81
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,170
Speaker 0: For basically a box that hangs on the wall.

82
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,271
Speaker 1: I'm going to guess $1,400.

83
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:42,070
Speaker 1: Oh, whatever!

84
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:42,947
Speaker 0: For a box.

85
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,129
Speaker 1: That hangs on the wall and holds up a bike.

86
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,047
Speaker 0: It's a box.

87
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,790
Speaker 1: I paid more than that for like one chair for my kitchen.

88
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:51,826
Speaker 0: It's a box.

89
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:54,277
Speaker 1: Go to Crate & Barrel.

90
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:56,290
Speaker 1: Look at how much their box shelf costs.

91
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,676
Speaker 0: Who at IKEA?

92
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,169
Speaker 0: Look how much their box shelf costs.

93
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:00,822
Speaker 1: I'll look into this thing.

94
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:01,450
Speaker 1: We'll see, though.

95
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:05,090
Speaker 1: I really, really miss having a garage.

96
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:15,110
Speaker 1: I would like to be able to have one of the full-on devices to hold my bike up and be able to spray toxic chemicals all over it without just being in my apartment.

97
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,370
Speaker 0: Why are you spraying toxic chemicals in your bike?

98
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,550
Speaker 1: Like degreasers.

99
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:19,950
Speaker 0: You don't like the paint job?

100
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,416
Speaker 1: Degreaser stuff.

101
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:25,310
Speaker 1: Different kinds of lubricants and seals and whatever.

102
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,190
Speaker 1: I don't have to do it that often, but I have to do it occasionally.

103
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,216
Speaker 1: Skis actually are far worse.

104
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:33,210
Speaker 1: I got to use dangerous shit to get all the old wax off.

105
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,750
Speaker 1: And then the waxes I use have like fluorine in them, so not really supposed to use them indoors.

106
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,730
Speaker 0: Well, we're doing a news roundup, so what are we going to talk about between now and things of the day?

107
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,630
Speaker 1: The news that is not directly related to gaming, but is related to gaming in the sense that it's a gaming con.

108
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,977
Speaker 1: So PAX, PAX East is coming up real soon.

109
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:55,150
Speaker 1: We're doing one panel, possibly two panels, depends on how things shake down.

110
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,050
Speaker 1: PAX is going to be awesome, as it always is, but there's been some big changes announced with this PAX East.

111
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,449
Speaker 1: Changes that fundamentally alter the landscape of PAX.

112
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:09,610
Speaker 0: Some changes are good, some changes are not good.

113
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:09,870
Speaker 1: Yep.

114
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:17,630
Speaker 1: Such that, you know, in the old days, like we used to review every PAX and we didn't because nothing changed, but now PAX is worth talking about again because stuff changed.

115
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:24,450
Speaker 1: If we ever wanted to do a here is how you should enjoy PAX show, we actually have to change the advice.

116
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,490
Speaker 0: Slightly.

117
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,250
Speaker 1: Two pieces of our advice are now broken.

118
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,910
Speaker 1: So, change the first, which is actually pretty big, but not as related to gaming.

119
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:40,450
Speaker 1: Mike and Jerry, Gabe and Tycho have been sort of distancing themselves as persons from being central to PAX over time.

120
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,810
Speaker 1: Partly because they've openly stated they want PAX to outlive them and Penny Arcade.

121
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:46,769
Speaker 1: Because someday they will die.

122
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,398
Speaker 1: That will happen.

123
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,629
Speaker 1: And the goal is that somehow...

124
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,290
Speaker 0: It could be tomorrow, if they let Mike have that motorcycle.

125
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:57,018
Speaker 1: So, hopefully PAX will outlive them.

126
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:01,030
Speaker 1: Hopefully PAX will outlive us and outlive everyone who goes to it today because I really like PAX.

127
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:09,230
Speaker 1: So, one of the mainstays of PAX is the Gabe and Tycho Q&A, which always happens right after the keynote.

128
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,338
Speaker 0: The hustle.

129
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,689
Speaker 0: And there's two of these things.

130
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:16,789
Speaker 1: We have always considered this one of the must-see events, but it's interesting...

131
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:27,470
Speaker 0: If you go to PAX and you don't actually care about Penny Arcade itself, you just care about gaming and you're going to it as a gaming convention, and you're not a fan of Penny Arcade, then I guess you don't have to go there.

132
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:35,530
Speaker 1: Ah, but even then, in those early days, the Q&A was more for the stand-up comedy than any fandom of Gabe or Tycho.

133
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,157
Speaker 0: Sure.

134
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:36,730
Speaker 0: Maybe.

135
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:42,990
Speaker 1: It was also right after, immediately after, the keynote, so you might as well stick around for the beginning of it.

136
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,569
Speaker 0: At least stick around for the hustle.

137
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:54,170
Speaker 1: So, over the years, people asked every possible question they could ask, and the questions got increasingly redundant or stupid.

138
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,510
Speaker 0: And there were some traditions that you wanted to keep going.

139
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,170
Speaker 0: Knucklecrack.

140
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,710
Speaker 0: Knucklecracking, and swear-wording, and such, right?

141
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:10,287
Speaker 0: And I went up at the last PAX Prime, and I said, "Hey, you know, we got all these traditions at the Q&A, but it's getting kind of samey.

142
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:11,529
Speaker 0: You don't even want to mix it

143
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:11,710
Speaker 0: up.".

144
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:13,629
Speaker 0: And everyone booed me.

145
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,569
Speaker 1: The audience wanted to kill you.

146
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:18,090
Speaker 0: I don't know if they wanted to kill me, but they were boos.

147
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:21,287
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Alright, the PAX is spoken, whatevs, I'll sit

148
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:21,549
Speaker 0: down.".

149
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:22,970
Speaker 0: And look who was right!

150
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:23,890
Speaker 0: And look who was right!

151
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,590
Speaker 0: Look what happened!

152
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:26,616
Speaker 0: They removed the Q&A.

153
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:31,070
Speaker 0: What they're doing now, Mike and Jerry will still make themselves available to people who want to talk.

154
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,249
Speaker 1: In fact, they're going to make themselves more available at the time.

155
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,430
Speaker 0: Right.

156
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:42,510
Speaker 0: Anyone who wants to see them or talk to them and cares about them can probably, there's lots of time where you can meet them and sign with them and trade pins and give them money and all that stuff.

157
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:45,609
Speaker 0: Even more time of theirs is dedicated to that.

158
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,135
Speaker 0: But they are removing the Q&As.

159
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:54,510
Speaker 0: The only Q&A they will have is the Maker Strip, which sort of had Q&A integrated with it because Jerry doesn't have much to do.

160
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:55,730
Speaker 0: While Mike is drawing.

161
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,436
Speaker 1: And it makes it sort of a fun event.

162
00:07:57,456 --> 00:08:00,090
Speaker 1: So now you've got the background of him drawing and the questions.

163
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:09,190
Speaker 0: But there's another change to this in that you cannot just walk up to the mic and ask a goddamn question, you weirdo who always asks weird questions and puts on a show.

164
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,170
Speaker 1: Yes, Scott.

165
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,791
Speaker 0: Right.

166
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:14,622
Speaker 0: All those people sit your ass down.

167
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:17,270
Speaker 0: Instead, people are submitting questions on the internet.

168
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,237
Speaker 0: I think the time for doing so might even already be over, if not soon.

169
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:28,390
Speaker 0: And then they are going to manually handpick questions, put them in envelopes and open and read them.

170
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,152
Speaker 1: Here's the cool thing.

171
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:32,402
Speaker 1: From what I gather, there will be normal envelopes and red envelopes.

172
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:35,250
Speaker 1: Mike and Jerry will not know what the questions are ahead of time.

173
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,239
Speaker 1: So someone else will just, you know, weed out all the stupid ones.

174
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,030
Speaker 1: But otherwise, they'll just give them a list and they can read whichever ones they want.

175
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,909
Speaker 1: And the red ones are supposedly the ones that might anger or frighten them.

176
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:46,995
Speaker 1: So we'll see how they do that.

177
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:50,469
Speaker 1: We'll see how much of that is showmanship versus actually...

178
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,323
Speaker 0: I've never gone to Megastrip and you know what?

179
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:53,070
Speaker 1: I won't.

180
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,150
Speaker 1: We tried to that one time and then it got canceled.

181
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,461
Speaker 0: So now I think it's an omen.

182
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:57,209
Speaker 0: I'm just not going to go to it.

183
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:57,650
Speaker 1: Yeah.

184
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:04,070
Speaker 1: So it's interesting because for a long time, the culture of PAX, a big part of it was that sort of back and forth.

185
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:11,650
Speaker 1: The Q&A sort of merged into the sort of someone prompts them in some fashion and they respond in a funny fashion.

186
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:16,410
Speaker 1: But as time went on, you know, when you're watching like an anime, you're watching a movie with friends.

187
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,926
Speaker 1: Occasionally, that dude in the back yells out that thing at that perfect moment.

188
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:23,350
Speaker 1: that's just utterly hilarious.

189
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:25,081
Speaker 1: And it's great.

190
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:25,870
Speaker 1: And everyone laughs.

191
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,570
Speaker 0: And then everyone tries to do it and fails.

192
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:35,730
Speaker 0: They try to recreate that moment, but they don't have the comedy skills or timing or coolness of that guy who did it the once.

193
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:43,030
Speaker 0: And that guy who did it the once, he's not doing it again because he recognizes he doesn't have the thing as funny as that at that exact time.

194
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,179
Speaker 0: That time has come and gone.

195
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:51,490
Speaker 0: And there's no reason... If you try to put too much work into making it happen, it will reek of effort.

196
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:51,972
Speaker 1: Yup.

197
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:53,225
Speaker 1: He had his moment in the sun.

198
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:53,670
Speaker 1: He's done.

199
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:00,210
Speaker 1: Nerds always forget that MST3K 1 was scripted and 2 is way fucking harder than you all think it is.

200
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:00,611
Speaker 0: Yeah.

201
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:05,750
Speaker 0: They would watch the thing like a zillion times, writing down jokes, figuring out which ones were funny.

202
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,228
Speaker 0: At which moments, right?

203
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,417
Speaker 1: "Ave

204
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:09,640
Speaker 1: Maria."

205
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:10,398
Speaker 1: Right.

206
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,889
Speaker 0: So... Albert Biddy.

207
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:13,847
Speaker 1: For Biddy?

208
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:18,350
Speaker 1: That might be literally my favorite moment in all of MST3K.

209
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:30,750
Speaker 1: But basically, there was this sort of liminality between when the Q&As were mostly direct questions that got answered by them, about them in Penny Arcade.

210
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:36,650
Speaker 1: And PAX East, the first few, really had that going on because a lot of these people had never seen them before, never been to a PAX.

211
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:49,890
Speaker 1: But then there was this sort of liminal period where the questions were mostly petered out, so people would ask redundant questions, but the occasional person would do something funny, put on a show, pull a prank.

212
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,520
Speaker 1: And about a third of those were legit funny.

213
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:54,810
Speaker 1: And the rest were pretty bad.

214
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,849
Speaker 0: And then of course there's the emotional sob story section.

215
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:58,452
Speaker 1: Yup.

216
00:10:58,675 --> 00:10:59,749
Speaker 1: Which is an important part.

217
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:00,249
Speaker 0: Sure.

218
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:11,630
Speaker 1: As time went on, it got to the point to where every single fucking person who walked up to that microphone had this long and elaborate skit that usually didn't really pan out.

219
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:23,065
Speaker 1: So, I'm not super sad to see it go, partly because there's YouTube video of all the great moments from the past, and I doubt that anything good enough to be worth sitting through.

220
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:25,930
Speaker 1: it would have ever happened further if it continued with the old format.

221
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, the past few PAXes, we've been leaving that shit early.

222
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,193
Speaker 1: What do we always say?

223
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:35,750
Speaker 1: The problem with anime cons is that they're beholden to the hobgoblin of consistency.

224
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:42,550
Speaker 1: That we had a rave in '08, so we're gonna have raves 'til the sun burns up in the sky.

225
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,130
Speaker 1: But Penny Arcade and PAX always were very willing to make huge changes as time went on.

226
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:58,010
Speaker 1: So this is actually exactly in the spirit of everything we've said is great about PAX, that they're willing to say that something needs to change and try something radically different.

227
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:01,150
Speaker 0: But, not everything they change is for the better.

228
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:08,297
Speaker 1: So, PAX Prime, because badges sell out in like four nanoseconds, started two things.

229
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:19,610
Speaker 1: They went to four days instead of three, which, if you don't go to a lot of cons, I cannot express to you how big a difference it is between a three-day con and a four-day con.

230
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,348
Speaker 0: Magfest.

231
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:24,749
Speaker 1: It's as big of a difference between a convention center con and a hotel con.

232
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:33,670
Speaker 0: That you have two days that are full days, as opposed to a three-day con, where you have the entry day, the full day, and the get home day.

233
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,296
Speaker 0: Now you've got the get in day, the full day, the full day.

234
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:41,463
Speaker 0: It's like adding just one day, making the con 33% bigger, actually makes it like 66% bigger.

235
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:46,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is nuts.

236
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,636
Speaker 0: Because that's a full day you're adding.

237
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:50,361
Speaker 0: It's like you think it's a three-day con.

238
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:53,670
Speaker 0: No, a three-day con is actually like a two-day con, right?

239
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:01,830
Speaker 0: But now, once you add an extra one day, that two-day con is actually now a three-day con.

240
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:11,410
Speaker 1: So, to make the enforcers be able to survive this, and just for logistical reasons, they shortened every day, so instead of ending at 2am, it ended at midnight.

241
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:17,107
Speaker 0: Which makes sense, you added a whole extra day, enforcers can't be working to two every one of those days, right?

242
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:18,150
Speaker 0: At least the first three of them.

243
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:26,390
Speaker 0: You gotta, you know, take the hours off the days you had, and put some of those hours into the fourth day, but you're still adding hours in total, right?

244
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,930
Speaker 0: And those are late night, useless hours anyway, you've just turned them into valuable day hours.

245
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:36,687
Speaker 1: So, the stated rationale was, extra day, so we gotta end this shit early.

246
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,490
Speaker 1: That made sense.

247
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:38,188
Speaker 0: Makes sense.

248
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,010
Speaker 1: PAX East this year, ends at midnight, but is only three days.

249
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,848
Speaker 0: Fuck you, how am I supposed to game between midnight and 2am?

250
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,035
Speaker 1: This is even, this is bad for a much more subtle reason.

251
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:59,370
Speaker 1: At PAX Prime, ending at midnight was no big deal, because there are, like, ten hotels within four minutes of walking of the convention center, and there's gaming in all of them.

252
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:09,830
Speaker 1: Gaming happens at night, so easily there, because there's so much space and so many things right in the neighborhood, and it's summer, so you can just walk outside, no one cares.

253
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:15,309
Speaker 0: Also, well it's sort of summer, it's Labor Day weekend, the end of summer, it's warm enough, yeah.

254
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:32,770
Speaker 0: Also, PAX Prime has their tabletop in a hotel in the area, well it's extra tabletop basically, in a hotel in the area, and you can go there pretty late, and there's tables there, so you can game into the hours, even though PAX is technically closed.

255
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,110
Speaker 1: And even when that area technically closes, you can just go into other areas of all these hotels.

256
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:37,909
Speaker 0: That have tables.

257
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:47,270
Speaker 1: So, all these factors combined mean that it's no big deal at all, but PAX East, there's one fucking hotel, and even enforcers can't get into that shit.

258
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:55,990
Speaker 1: So as a result, everyone is staying pretty far away from the con, so the hotel hangout culture is already dead at PAX East.

259
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,029
Speaker 0: Also, the hotels at PAX East don't really have tables to play games at.

260
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:02,270
Speaker 1: Because they're all far away, they're not really directly...

261
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:04,430
Speaker 0: Even the close one doesn't really have a lot of tables.

262
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, the close one really not a great hotel.

263
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:09,609
Speaker 0: No, not, definitely not a good place for tabletop gaming.

264
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:17,670
Speaker 0: So you basically, all we did was just lose the four best hours of tabletop gaming at PAX East, and we didn't get anything in exchange for it.

265
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,570
Speaker 1: Yep, because now, basically I have to, when I eat dinner, like eight o'clock, I have to leave PAX.

266
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:29,070
Speaker 1: There's no, because if I go back to PAX after dinner, I will not have enough time to finish a serious game.

267
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:29,450
Speaker 1: Nope.

268
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,834
Speaker 1: Before tabletop closes.

269
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:37,310
Speaker 1: So I might as well go somewhere that'll take me through the night, but there's no spaces near the convention for that.

270
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:48,090
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna have to go back to my hotel, which is like a mile or two away, and you're gonna see a huge fracturing of the tabletop and gaming experience around PAX.

271
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,610
Speaker 1: PAX is gonna be dead at night.

272
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:57,010
Speaker 0: Also, you have a situation where you gotta try to get a hotel room with a table in it, so you can at least play games with the people you're staying with.

273
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,435
Speaker 1: Yep, which is gonna be tough.

274
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:02,830
Speaker 1: And all the Airbnb, everything we look in, there's no hotels or anything anywhere near PAX East.

275
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,859
Speaker 0: No, PAX East is not a place where you can walk around and do stuff after it closes.

276
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,390
Speaker 0: I mean, like, after PAX Prime, you can just walk over to the Gameworks and party it up.

277
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,505
Speaker 0: There's plenty of places to walk to and party it up.

278
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:14,150
Speaker 0: PAX East, nope.

279
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:19,770
Speaker 1: So this is basically a huge punch in the dick for all the things that I like to do at PAX.

280
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,035
Speaker 0: Pretty much, yeah.

281
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:23,470
Speaker 0: Just lost four hours of awesome PAXness.

282
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,911
Speaker 1: Yep.

283
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:38,310
Speaker 0: Which, I hate to say it, I think the reason they did it is because basically, while we were having great times in those four hours, the population of PAX during those hours was relatively low compared to what was, you know, and they're not losing any money.

284
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:44,130
Speaker 0: They're just, basically, those four hours were costing them a lot of money and they weren't getting a lot for what they were paying, right?

285
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:44,528
Speaker 0: True.

286
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:50,228
Speaker 0: They're just basically saving a fuck ton of money and enforcer time and everything by cutting out those four hours of PAX.

287
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:56,386
Speaker 1: Like I said, there's all these reasons why it's not a big deal, but at PAX East, it kills the entire evening.

288
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:57,850
Speaker 1: I'm gonna leave for dinner and never come back.

289
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:07,310
Speaker 1: So, I can now officially say, in a way that I couldn't say before, that PAX Prime is in every way objectively better than PAX East now.

290
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:12,089
Speaker 1: Like, there's a reason why I enforce at East, because I'm not missing as much.

291
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, I'm actually trying to, I chose first priority for enforcing that night shift.

292
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:17,329
Speaker 0: Yeah.

293
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,675
Speaker 0: It's now, that shift is now two hours shorter.

294
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:23,404
Speaker 0: It's like 6.30 to midnight for that enforcer shift, right?

295
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:25,490
Speaker 0: So, it's really easy to do.

296
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:27,614
Speaker 0: Five and a half hours or so.

297
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:29,819
Speaker 0: It's gonna be low population.

298
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:34,290
Speaker 0: You only have to do two days, not three days, because on the Sunday, you basically don't have to enforce.

299
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:37,358
Speaker 0: And it's like, why would I not choose that shift?

300
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:40,610
Speaker 0: That shift used to be the pony shift that went to 2 AM and that's why it sucked.

301
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:41,939
Speaker 1: I'm taking another tack, though.

302
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,630
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be enforcing the entire con.

303
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,650
Speaker 0: Oh, good luck with that.

304
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying this out.

305
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,482
Speaker 0: So, you're not leaving at 8 and not coming back.

306
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:49,690
Speaker 0: You're staying there till midnight.

307
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:51,350
Speaker 1: I'll be there till midnight every day.

308
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:57,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, but other people, who are just attendees, go to dinner and there's no reason to come back to PAX that late.

309
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,626
Speaker 1: But I hate to say it, though, because PAX will sell out.

310
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:00,150
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

311
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,215
Speaker 0: It's already sold out.

312
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:02,403
Speaker 0: It's been sold out.

313
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:03,610
Speaker 0: It's been sold out before this news.

314
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:04,470
Speaker 1: Selling out immediately.

315
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,330
Speaker 0: If this news came out a long time ago, it still would have sold out no matter what.

316
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:09,610
Speaker 0: I will keep going to PAX East.

317
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,110
Speaker 0: It would sell out if it ended at 9.

318
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:20,570
Speaker 1: But what's interesting is that everyone I know who does not enforce or is not a guest or an exhibitor no longer goes to PAX East.

319
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,110
Speaker 0: Right, well, if you're just a normal attendee who's gotta pay for a badge, right?

320
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:26,565
Speaker 0: It's a huge pain in the ass to go, right?

321
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:34,470
Speaker 0: And unless there's something there that you're really into, it doesn't make up for the pain in the ass factor, right?

322
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:42,210
Speaker 0: If you're going for, like us, mostly for the tabletop action, you can get better tabletop action at Kineticon or MagFest.

323
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:59,870
Speaker 0: So if that's your number one reason to go and you don't care about, say, Penny Arcade or the big game companies in the Expo Hall or any of the panels or any of that stuff, it's probably, I mean, as awesome as PAX is, even though if you're a gamer, you'll have a great time at PAX.

324
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:13,150
Speaker 0: But in terms of the cost of time and money versus what you get in return ratio, with that specific interest set, you will get better value from a different convention than PAX.

325
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,888
Speaker 1: Yup, so as a result...

326
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:20,010
Speaker 0: You'll also get over your sour grapes of not being able to get a PAX badge by telling yourself that.

327
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:29,270
Speaker 1: But it just, as PAX East is just not, you know, for people like us, it's not as good a con anymore.

328
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,709
Speaker 0: Well, PAX East isn't.

329
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, PAX Prime is still the best.

330
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

331
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,830
Speaker 1: But part of that really is the area, it's Seattle, it's the weather, it's the fact that there are actually hotels.

332
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:47,230
Speaker 0: You know what, if there was a convention center in New York that wasn't the Javits, PAX New York could be the best easily.

333
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:55,028
Speaker 1: Possibly not though, for the simple fact, well, it could be because there's enough gamers just in New York who don't need hotel rooms.

334
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,850
Speaker 0: And with a convention center, right, so you don't have to walk all that far west.

335
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,572
Speaker 0: Yeah, so here's the thing.

336
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:05,190
Speaker 1: You could have a PAX that probably sold out just with people who already live here.

337
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:08,569
Speaker 1: So the hotel issue is no longer a concern.

338
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:09,330
Speaker 0: That's right.

339
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,289
Speaker 1: But it means no one outside of New York could go.

340
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,574
Speaker 0: Good, that makes it even better.

341
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,642
Speaker 0: Best PAX ever.

342
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:16,008
Speaker 0: New York only.

343
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:16,610
Speaker 0: Next.

344
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:23,910
Speaker 1: But it's interesting to see that one by every year with PAX East, a number of our friends stop going to PAX East.

345
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:39,309
Speaker 1: They'll still go to Prime if they travel to that, or they'll go to Magfest and all these other cons, but other than the professionals and the people who had a sort of industry reason to be at PAX, most of our friends stop going to PAX East and the trend now has sort of pushed all the rest of them out.

346
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:43,050
Speaker 1: I wonder what they'll change next at PAX East.

347
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,344
Speaker 0: I also wonder what they'll change next.

348
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:46,330
Speaker 0: Perhaps the price.

349
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:58,209
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

350
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:04,550
Speaker 1: Scott has not seen it, but I saw Frozen, and my opinion I'll leave out of this.

351
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,930
Speaker 1: I liked the movie, it had some problems, but it wasn't a bad movie.

352
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,590
Speaker 0: But there's a song- It's not Manos, Hands of Fate.

353
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:11,549
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

354
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,849
Speaker 1: So it has a song, Let It Go, that has kind of been used in a lot of mashups, a lot of parodies.

355
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:24,850
Speaker 0: I haven't heard the song, but I've seen enough links on the internet that say, "Let it go something Frozen something" to know that there's clearly some popularity to this thing.

356
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,382
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good song, you'd like the moral.

357
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:30,486
Speaker 1: The moral is basically, "Fuck it and all you fuckers, I'm free, I do what I

358
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:30,768
Speaker 1: want.".

359
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:31,748
Speaker 0: I do what I want.

360
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do what I want.

361
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,770
Speaker 0: Lemon hope, I do what I want.

362
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:43,390
Speaker 1: So this dude sings Let It Go, but he sings it as a medley of, I think, 21 different Disney character voices.

363
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:47,530
Speaker 1: And it is a wide range of Disney character voices.

364
00:21:48,714 --> 00:21:49,047
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

365
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:49,909
Speaker 1: It's all right.

366
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:56,327
Speaker 1: I mean, Mickey Mouse, Pete, as in Goofy's or Mickey Mouse's nemesis, Rosalind from Monsters,

367
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:56,668
Speaker 1: Inc.,

368
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,230
Speaker 1: Scar, that seagull, this is pretty amazing.

369
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,210
Speaker 1: And it's gotten a few million more views since when I first saw it, so popularity rising.

370
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,430
Speaker 0: Okay, so normally in the New York City, there is much musical performance on the streets and in the subways.

371
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:15,970
Speaker 0: And the vast majority of it is garbage.

372
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:20,465
Speaker 0: It's some homeless guy who's got himself a sousaphone and he's going, "Doot!

373
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:21,890
Speaker 1: Toodly-doot.".

374
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,788
Speaker 1: There's this guy.

375
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,549
Speaker 1: Toot, toot, toot.

376
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,416
Speaker 1: There's this guy.

377
00:22:24,436 --> 00:22:26,841
Speaker 1: Oh my God, Emily and I. Toot, toot, toot.

378
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:31,110
Speaker 1: You know that long hallway between the seven and the four fives?

379
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,102
Speaker 0: Toot, toot, toot.

380
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:34,650
Speaker 1: In Grand Central, there's like that long angle tunnel.

381
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:38,550
Speaker 1: So there's always people there selling churros, the same lady.

382
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,469
Speaker 0: Yup, I know the churro lady.

383
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:44,130
Speaker 1: So there's always either the girl playing fiddle music and she plays nerdy stuff sometimes, like Legend of Zelda.

384
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,289
Speaker 1: Or there's a guy with a full-size harp who's super good at it.

385
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,084
Speaker 0: Oh, I've never seen Harp Guy.

386
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:51,529
Speaker 0: I love harps.

387
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,009
Speaker 1: Harp Guy is the best guy.

388
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,050
Speaker 0: Can he play the song for Mickey McBeanstock?

389
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:56,248
Speaker 1: I'll bet he could.

390
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,229
Speaker 1: No, this guy is legit.

391
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:04,150
Speaker 1: But about a third of the time lately, it's been a dude with a Casio keyboard.

392
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,870
Speaker 0: Alright.

393
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,282
Speaker 1: And a huge amplifier.

394
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,110
Speaker 1: This shit is loud.

395
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,166
Speaker 0: No, you gotta do it.

396
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:11,970
Speaker 1: And he's got the standard built-in beats going on in the background.

397
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:20,870
Speaker 1: Like that... And he's very slowly and very poorly playing the melody to Fur Elise.

398
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:27,610
Speaker 1: Over and over and over again.

399
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:28,968
Speaker 1: And that's it.

400
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:31,370
Speaker 0: Yup, that's pretty typical.

401
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:34,930
Speaker 0: So, if you're just a tourist and you're walking by quickly, right?

402
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,460
Speaker 0: It's like, you could maybe think, "Oh, this guy's playing a song.

403
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,544
Speaker 0: It sounds kinda good.

404
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:40,467
Speaker 0: Makes it pleasant.

405
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:41,029
Speaker 0: I'll give him some

406
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:41,370
Speaker 0: monies.".

407
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:50,370
Speaker 0: But there are many, though they are not the majority, subway and street musicians who are the awesomeness.

408
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,314
Speaker 0: And they play the awesome music.

409
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:57,210
Speaker 0: Usually, if you go to the G-Train Metropolitan Ave Station, there's some hipsters.

410
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:05,310
Speaker 0: And they do a thing where the percussion's on one platform, the uptown platform, and the fiddle's on the downtown platform.

411
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:09,210
Speaker 0: I guess north and south, there's no uptown/downtown on the G-Train.

412
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:12,460
Speaker 0: And they sort of play together and it's pretty awesome.

413
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:15,027
Speaker 0: They even applause those fuckers.

414
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:15,890
Speaker 0: They're so good, right?

415
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:24,210
Speaker 0: But regardless, I think the best subway music in New York City that I have seen are these guys who can be seen in Union Square.

416
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:29,983
Speaker 0: I actually saw them on Vimeo before I saw them... I actually haven't seen them in person.

417
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:32,010
Speaker 0: I've only seen them on Vimeo.

418
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:36,519
Speaker 0: But the name of their band is Too Many Zoos.

419
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:40,850
Speaker 0: And if you listen to the music, you'll see that that name is apt.

420
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,094
Speaker 0: The music is much zoos.

421
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:48,430
Speaker 0: And you can go see their five-song album on Bandcamp, which I actually paid for.

422
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:55,210
Speaker 0: The fifth song is an excellent, excellent cover of the highest quality of a song Rym had never heard before.

423
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,192
Speaker 1: What can I say?

424
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:59,066
Speaker 1: I listen to mostly Rachmaninoff and Weird Ska.

425
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:00,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

426
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:03,145
Speaker 0: That song's something you should know from your childhood.

427
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:03,486
Speaker 0: Anyway...

428
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,074
Speaker 1: It's got my childhood.

429
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:07,790
Speaker 1: I spent listening mostly to jazz and classical music.

430
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,715
Speaker 0: This is a type of jazz.

431
00:25:11,842 --> 00:25:12,143
Speaker 0: I guess.

432
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:14,410
Speaker 0: I'm not even sure what you would call this, but it's awesome.

433
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:23,570
Speaker 0: I don't know a human being who would not like this music in some way, so you should definitely give your X minutes of time to checking them out.

434
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,554
Speaker 1: Alright.

435
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:27,110
Speaker 1: In the metamona, book club book is Wool.

436
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:29,856
Speaker 0: I started reading Wool, and you know what?

437
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:30,718
Speaker 0: I gotta tell you this.

438
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,650
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna ruin, spill all the beans, and give up a whole book club episode's worth.

439
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,599
Speaker 0: But if you're maybe sitting out there thinking, "Should I read Wool?

440
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:43,369
Speaker 0: Is this something that I should give my time to just because Rym and Scott said

441
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:43,530
Speaker 0: so?"

442
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,412
Speaker 0: Well, let me tell you this.

443
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:51,070
Speaker 0: I read page one, and there were three things that immediately lit up on the scoreboard.

444
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,834
Speaker 0: Thing number one was Logan's Run.

445
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,159
Speaker 0: Thing number two was Fallout.

446
00:25:56,482 --> 00:26:00,230
Speaker 0: And thing number three was... what's the other thing in that category?

447
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,212
Speaker 1: The Road?

448
00:26:02,673 --> 00:26:03,695
Speaker 0: No, I don't know what that is.

449
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:04,617
Speaker 1: Really?

450
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:05,539
Speaker 1: Paranoia?

451
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:07,142
Speaker 0: Paranoia, the RPG.

452
00:26:07,162 --> 00:26:11,030
Speaker 0: Oh, also... there's another one.

453
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,655
Speaker 1: You really have never heard of The Road?

454
00:26:13,217 --> 00:26:13,398
Speaker 0: No.

455
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:14,181
Speaker 0: Okay.

456
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:15,204
Speaker 1: Mad Max?

457
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:16,388
Speaker 0: The second volume of Phoenix.

458
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:16,850
Speaker 0: Future.

459
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,972
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

460
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:22,239
Speaker 0: All four of those lights turned on, right?

461
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:27,310
Speaker 0: And Wool is... and I kept reading, and all those lights are still on.

462
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:38,730
Speaker 0: So if any of those things is your jam, Fallout the video game, Paranoia the RPG, Phoenix volume two, the Tezuka manga, Future, and Logan's Run.

463
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,108
Speaker 0: If any one of those things is your jam and you want more of those things, Wool is one of those things.

464
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:44,630
Speaker 0: Alright.

465
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:49,962
Speaker 0: So, I'm not going to tell you if it's good or bad, just that it's still one of those things.

466
00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:53,150
Speaker 0: I'm almost done with it, and it's still one of those things.

467
00:26:54,430 --> 00:27:00,170
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I continue in my private life to constantly make fun of the Kingkiller Chronicle, so you should check out.

468
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:06,130
Speaker 1: We have done a whole bunch of book club books, so if you want to read a book, you don't really have to follow the book club chronologically.

469
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,450
Speaker 1: Just look at the list of books, read one of them, and then listen to our show about that book.

470
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:15,930
Speaker 0: And then go to the forum and find the thread for that and post in it.

471
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:22,950
Speaker 1: Which I don't think you've actually set it up to where the forum threads are linked directly in all the book club episodes on the site.

472
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,229
Speaker 0: They should be, I'll check on it.

473
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:24,832
Speaker 1: Oh, they are now.

474
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,483
Speaker 1: They weren't there when I checked a long time.

475
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:27,489
Speaker 1: Oh, not all of them though.

476
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:28,826
Speaker 0: We can fix that.

477
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:32,450
Speaker 1: Oh right, the man who was Thursday.

478
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,001
Speaker 0: Also, you should follow us in all the places on the internet.

479
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:38,670
Speaker 0: Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, YouTube.

480
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,669
Speaker 1: In fact, I did a recent YouTube upload.

481
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,513
Speaker 0: We have an IRC channel.

482
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:47,346
Speaker 0: People are actually in that IRC channel.

483
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,310
Speaker 0: They're still in there.

484
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:54,550
Speaker 0: Even though we stopped using it, I mean, for a time we were using it only for Salty Bet tournaments.

485
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,410
Speaker 0: And now that Salty Bet has fallen by the wayside, people are still in there.

486
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,509
Speaker 1: You might get back in there.

487
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,309
Speaker 0: Get in that IRC when you're at work.

488
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:07,833
Speaker 1: We are going to be, this weekend, at Anime Boston 2014.

489
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:08,330
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

490
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,790
Speaker 1: We are doing, on Friday, fundamental anime.

491
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,110
Speaker 0: It's anime you should see, only with a different title.

492
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,176
Speaker 1: And a different list.

493
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:16,370
Speaker 1: A similar, but slightly crooked list.

494
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:16,908
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

495
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,910
Speaker 1: We are doing the secret guide to running panels on Saturday.

496
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:21,350
Speaker 0: We've done that before.

497
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,650
Speaker 1: Also known as, how to run a panel.

498
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,189
Speaker 0: Also known as the panel panel.

499
00:28:25,395 --> 00:28:25,526
Speaker 0: Yup.

500
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,670
Speaker 0: And the meta panel.

501
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,490
Speaker 1: We are doing, on Saturday, not all anime are what they seem.

502
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:33,810
Speaker 0: Oh, it's just something we came up with to fill a slot.

503
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:38,270
Speaker 1: It's a panel about anime that look like one thing, but are actually something else.

504
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:39,450
Speaker 0: A lot of anime.

505
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:40,240
Speaker 1: Yes.

506
00:28:40,564 --> 00:28:40,970
Speaker 1: But then.

507
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,428
Speaker 0: Much like our panels, which look like one thing, but are actually something else.

508
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,565
Speaker 1: But then we're doing, Saturday evening, 7.30, Judge Anime Bytes cover.

509
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,970
Speaker 0: Which we did last year, and it was a hit, so we're doing it again.

510
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,909
Speaker 0: So we'll just do that shit again.

511
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:00,390
Speaker 1: Well because, Judge Anime Bytes cover, you non-anime fans, here's what we do.

512
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,870
Speaker 1: We look at the list of anime that are coming in the next season that are not out yet.

513
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,949
Speaker 0: I guess we're always going to be doing this for summer seasons because Anime Boston is always in the spring.

514
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,078
Speaker 1: Like spring mid-season stuff.

515
00:29:11,621 --> 00:29:12,424
Speaker 1: There's a spring list.

516
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:13,870
Speaker 1: This is all stuff coming out in like April.

517
00:29:14,992 --> 00:29:16,710
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess because Anime Boston is a little earlier this year?

518
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could pull a few from the summer list because that's further out.

519
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,905
Speaker 0: Maybe, I don't know.

520
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,920
Speaker 1: But we're reviewing all of them.

521
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,770
Speaker 1: We're reviewing like 40 anime before they come out.

522
00:29:26,052 --> 00:29:27,670
Speaker 1: Based solely on their covers.

523
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,549
Speaker 0: So based on Prejudice.

524
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,790
Speaker 1: Yes, and it turns out that Prejudice is 99% accurate when it comes to judging media.

525
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:38,670
Speaker 0: If you are a good judge, and you have been there before.

526
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,666
Speaker 1: We're going to be at Zenkaikan, but more on that later.

527
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:42,289
Speaker 1: We're going to be at PAX.

528
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,901
Speaker 1: Our panel, our main panel is bad, not bad games.

529
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:48,230
Speaker 1: Our panel is Why No One Will Game With You.

530
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:49,410
Speaker 0: Oh, it's going to be good.

531
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,029
Speaker 1: We're going to tell you, specifically, why no one will game with you.

532
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:54,030
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

533
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,630
Speaker 1: It's going to be a really good panel.

534
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,649
Speaker 0: It's going to be LFG forever.

535
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,610
Speaker 1: People, some people might be really sad about this panel.

536
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:01,209
Speaker 0: That's tough.

537
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:03,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you'll see.

538
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,430
Speaker 0: Cold hard reality of the world.

539
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:06,506
Speaker 1: It's a rough- Accept it.

540
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:07,730
Speaker 1: It's a hard knock life.

541
00:30:07,854 --> 00:30:08,370
Speaker 0: Can't change it.

542
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:13,950
Speaker 1: Oh, and as a side note, I didn't want to make this a thing of the day.

543
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:14,873
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, Connecticut.

544
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:15,837
Speaker 1: We're scheduling.

545
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:18,850
Speaker 1: If you haven't submitted your panel, get on that shit real quick.

546
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,121
Speaker 0: Also, we'll be there.

547
00:30:20,141 --> 00:30:20,969
Speaker 0: You should come see us.

548
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll be there.

549
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:24,470
Speaker 1: We'll be ramping up a lot of Connecticut stuff in the very near future.

550
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,869
Speaker 0: And then PAX, and then MAGFest.

551
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,910
Speaker 1: And I did get in on the Daily Show McConnell-ing thing, so I uploaded my take.

552
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:32,649
Speaker 0: I'm uploading Netrunner videos.

553
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,350
Speaker 1: No, you're not going to do a McConnell-ing?

554
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:35,409
Speaker 0: I don't know what that is.

555
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,135
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

556
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,050
Speaker 1: Mitch McConnell, a Republican.

557
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,070
Speaker 1: A Republican who's one of the bad ones.

558
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:41,889
Speaker 0: He said something stupid.

559
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,251
Speaker 1: No.

560
00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:45,510
Speaker 1: He released a campaign ad that was kind of amazing.

561
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,309
Speaker 1: It's two and a half minutes with no words.

562
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:49,070
Speaker 0: That's long.

563
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,469
Speaker 1: Of just video of him doing stuff.

564
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:52,108
Speaker 0: What's he doing?

565
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,564
Speaker 1: Like kissing babies.

566
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,270
Speaker 1: Like signing papers.

567
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:55,879
Speaker 1: Like signing papers.

568
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:56,549
Speaker 1: Taking notes.

569
00:30:57,331 --> 00:30:59,066
Speaker 1: It's like if you told someone, "Hey, do-".

570
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,640
Speaker 0: So it's pretty much all just b-roll.

571
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:00,963
Speaker 0: 100% b-roll.

572
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:08,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically, "Hey, pretend that you're working, and we're going to film it, and then we're going to make a montage of you pretending to

573
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:08,469
Speaker 1: work.".

574
00:31:09,194 --> 00:31:09,510
Speaker 0: Alright.

575
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:13,290
Speaker 0: So that was the ad, and what the internet- Who would watch that for two and a half minutes?

576
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:20,970
Speaker 1: So what the internet's doing, after the Daily Show prompted them to, is setting it to random songs and seeing what matches.

577
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:21,860
Speaker 0: Okay.

578
00:31:22,898 --> 00:31:23,549
Speaker 0: Oh, it was silent?

579
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,790
Speaker 0: There wasn't even talking?

580
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:26,963
Speaker 1: No talking.

581
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:28,869
Speaker 0: Just one- There wasn't even a good background music?

582
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,530
Speaker 1: There is one derpy song in the background that sounds like a Casio keyboard.

583
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:38,250
Speaker 1: So everyone's just replacing it with "Baby Got Back," and it's actually pretty funny.

584
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,170
Speaker 1: So it's an internet thing that- it's one of those fake memes.

585
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,366
Speaker 0: You should replace it with "Too Many

586
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:44,648
Speaker 0: Zoos.".

587
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,236
Speaker 1: Oh, I should.

588
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:49,270
Speaker 1: I replaced it with like 100 things, but House of Cards fit best.

589
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:50,690
Speaker 0: Like the opening song?

590
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,072
Speaker 0: Yup.

591
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,470
Speaker 0: Basically- How about some cowboy v-bop music?

592
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,190
Speaker 1: This is a fake meme in the-.

593
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,850
Speaker 0: How about Evangelion opening music?

594
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,630
Speaker 1: The Daily Show told people to do this.

595
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,810
Speaker 0: How about tumbling down Evangelion music?

596
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,573
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

597
00:32:02,593 --> 00:32:07,228
Speaker 1: I was looking at some, "I'm above, baby, I can dance like a

598
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:07,309
Speaker 1: man.".

599
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:09,470
Speaker 1: That one actually fit pretty well.

600
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,033
Speaker 0: That's a good one?

601
00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:11,870
Speaker 0: You gotta find something that's two and a half minutes.

602
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,690
Speaker 1: No, I just cut mine off after a minute and thirty because I- it doesn't matter.

603
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,142
Speaker 1: The joke- the joke is- that's it.

604
00:32:18,182 --> 00:32:18,765
Speaker 1: That's the joke.

605
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:19,710
Speaker 1: You watch the first few minutes.

606
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:26,180
Speaker 1: It's kind of like when you watch an old, like, Winamp visualization of a song and you're like, "Man, it fits the song so

607
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:26,823
Speaker 1: well.".

608
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:27,868
Speaker 1: No it doesn't.

609
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:28,370
Speaker 1: Just random.

610
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:29,270
Speaker 0: Alright.

611
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,908
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's what I've been up to.

612
00:32:31,272 --> 00:32:33,490
Speaker 0: Okay, so, I guess we're gonna do a gaming news roundup.

613
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,529
Speaker 0: Gaming news roundup!

614
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,379
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of little gaming newses.

615
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:44,602
Speaker 0: Like, I had- we actually decided to do a gaming news roundup because our main show idea was crab people, and while I was looking for gaming news, I said, "Hey, there's, like, a lot of little gaming news.

616
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:45,348
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do, like, three of

617
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:45,530
Speaker 0: these.".

618
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,373
Speaker 0: And I said, "Wait a minute.

619
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:50,067
Speaker 0: This show will be much easier to do if we do a gaming news

620
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:50,609
Speaker 0: roundup.".

621
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:51,733
Speaker 0: So let's do it!

622
00:32:52,496 --> 00:32:54,222
Speaker 0: Gaming news number one, really easy.

623
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:56,510
Speaker 0: The remake and gauntlet for the PC.

624
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:57,577
Speaker 0: Great!

625
00:32:58,775 --> 00:32:59,590
Speaker 0: I know you love gauntlet.

626
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,877
Speaker 1: Gauntlet is really fun.

627
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:05,970
Speaker 1: I look forward to playing more gauntlet.

628
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,950
Speaker 0: I look forward to kids knowing what we mean when we say Green Wizard needs food badly.

629
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,893
Speaker 1: That's one positive.

630
00:33:13,896 --> 00:33:18,070
Speaker 1: So, when I was a kid, right, my first experiences with gauntlet was on the NES.

631
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,450
Speaker 1: So that shit was tight because it was just- it was, like, partly because I was a dumb kid.

632
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,610
Speaker 0: You didn't have to keep paying quarters.

633
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,720
Speaker 1: And I didn't really get games.

634
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,496
Speaker 1: Like, you know when you're a kid and you just play video games, like, "Video games!

635
00:33:29,596 --> 00:33:30,240
Speaker 1: Play my video

636
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,421
Speaker 1: game!".

637
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,065
Speaker 1: Like, you're not trying to win.

638
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:31,910
Speaker 1: You're just playing a video game.

639
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:36,987
Speaker 1: So, I would play Gauntlet 2, which had that weird, like, random map.

640
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:37,830
Speaker 1: Like, it would go on forever.

641
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,737
Speaker 1: And it was glitchy as all fuck.

642
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:46,999
Speaker 1: And I was just fascinated by, like, exploring increasingly weird glitches as these randomized maps went on and on.

643
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,030
Speaker 1: And then one day when I learned that it was an arcade game and I went to an arcade and I played in the arcade, yeah, I was done with that forever.

644
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,810
Speaker 0: Alright, so, basically the deal is, is the somewhat interesting information, right?

645
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,859
Speaker 0: So, there's W.B.I.E is the company, right?

646
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:06,289
Speaker 0: Which I think is, like, Warner Brothers something interactive entertainment, maybe?

647
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:06,810
Speaker 0: Right?

648
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,166
Speaker 0: Yeah.

649
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:17,050
Speaker 0: And they basically, when Midway went out of business, they bought up Marble Madness, Defender, Robotron, Spy Hunter, Sinistar, Joust, and Gauntlet.

650
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,850
Speaker 1: Meaning every game that is egregiously unrealized is potential for a remake.

651
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,150
Speaker 0: I wonder who picked up Rampart.

652
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:25,074
Speaker 1: Oh...

653
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:26,263
Speaker 0: Let's go find out.

654
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:26,668
Speaker 0: Anyway...

655
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,188
Speaker 1: Why don't we pick up Rampart?

656
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,400
Speaker 0: Find out who's got it.

657
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,228
Speaker 0: We gotta get it from them.

658
00:34:31,351 --> 00:34:35,370
Speaker 0: So, the people, the people, the development studio, that's the publisher, right?

659
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,489
Speaker 0: The development studio is Arrowhead Games, makers of Magica.

660
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,842
Speaker 0: And, which makes sense for them to make Gauntlet, right?

661
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:45,449
Speaker 0: Because their game is already pretty Gauntlet-y.

662
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:51,127
Speaker 0: And they're gonna make it for PC, Steam, SteamOS, etc.

663
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:51,889
Speaker 0: Right?

664
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,002
Speaker 0: So, this could be interesting, actually.

665
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:55,150
Speaker 0: It could be a good Gauntlet.

666
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:57,965
Speaker 1: The thing is, what do you mean by a good Gauntlet?

667
00:34:57,985 --> 00:34:58,650
Speaker 1: Because Gauntlet games...

668
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,289
Speaker 0: One where you don't have to pump in quarters and lose life constantly no matter what.

669
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:06,130
Speaker 0: Or, maybe one where you have to put in double quarters and lose life twice as fast.

670
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:10,150
Speaker 1: It's just, fundamentally, Gauntlet is like a ghetto version of Diablo.

671
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,310
Speaker 0: I had, you know, there was... I know you don't like the Gauntlets, but remember I bought that Gauntlet for the GameCube?

672
00:35:15,391 --> 00:35:17,810
Speaker 1: I remember, and you'd play it every day, and I couldn't imagine why.

673
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,629
Speaker 0: You didn't want to play it.

674
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,630
Speaker 0: Because it was stupid.

675
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,394
Speaker 0: Listen, in high school...

676
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,657
Speaker 1: The Switch we can see.

677
00:35:26,818 --> 00:35:28,185
Speaker 1: Walk over to the Switch.

678
00:35:28,205 --> 00:35:29,290
Speaker 0: Now the gate's open.

679
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:38,509
Speaker 0: In high school, we played Gauntlet for the N64, and listeners will come and tell you how good it was to play four-player Gauntlet on the N64.

680
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,350
Speaker 0: I think it was Gauntlet Legacy or whatever.

681
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,050
Speaker 1: That was only fun because of the combination of trolling and just the way co-op games went.

682
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,870
Speaker 0: That shit was good, and I thought that the GameCube one would recreate that scenario, but it did not.

683
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,649
Speaker 1: Ah, it's a shame.

684
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:53,637
Speaker 0: Anyway, other news!

685
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:54,962
Speaker 0: Blizzard, right?

686
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:56,930
Speaker 0: They make popular games.

687
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:02,630
Speaker 0: Diablo 3, we've talked about this when they announced it, but finally, the Auction House is over.

688
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:07,350
Speaker 0: Anything that's still in the Auction House is sort of still in there, but you can't auction off any new shit now.

689
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,290
Speaker 0: And I guess around June-ish, the Auction House will be completely gone.

690
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,990
Speaker 1: Thank the gods!

691
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:22,072
Speaker 0: So if you're the kind of person, like me, who will play Diablo when it's cheap, just because you've got like three hours and you want to click on something... Now's the time.

692
00:36:22,895 --> 00:36:26,427
Speaker 0: If you've already... That's assuming you've already beaten... What's the game?

693
00:36:26,568 --> 00:36:26,969
Speaker 0: Torch...

694
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:27,983
Speaker 1: Torchlight?

695
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:28,891
Speaker 0: Yeah.

696
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:35,807
Speaker 0: If you've already beaten Torchlight 1 and 2, and Diablo 1 and 2, and you need to click on even more, now is a good time to go.

697
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:37,150
Speaker 0: click on Diablo 3.

698
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,702
Speaker 0: Plus, I think it's a Diablo 3 expansion.

699
00:36:38,884 --> 00:36:39,650
Speaker 0: Even more to click on.

700
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:40,783
Speaker 1: The thing is, more and more...

701
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:43,190
Speaker 0: Satan might have extra heads to click on or something.

702
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:48,970
Speaker 1: For whatever reason, like those kinds of mindless games, I probably would have played them more recently.

703
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,661
Speaker 0: I'd play them more if Diablo 3 wasn't $50.

704
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:52,805
Speaker 0: Lower the price, Jesus.

705
00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:53,950
Speaker 0: $10 on Steam or some shit.

706
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,550
Speaker 1: Also, if Civ 5 hadn't gotten...

707
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,473
Speaker 0: This shit's old already.

708
00:36:57,734 --> 00:37:00,300
Speaker 0: Torchlight's $20 or less.

709
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,970
Speaker 0: I don't want to pay $50 for some World of Warcraft Diablo.

710
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,286
Speaker 1: I'll click about the same number of times in the course of a game of Civ 5.

711
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:09,370
Speaker 1: It'll be a little more fulfilling.

712
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:09,991
Speaker 0: Maybe.

713
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:19,248
Speaker 0: Other Blizzard news, Hearthstone, which I played in beta, is now gonna... I mean, it's out now.

714
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:20,190
Speaker 0: It's not like a beta anymore.

715
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,679
Speaker 0: You can just play it, and it's free to play, so you can just play it if you want.

716
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:33,545
Speaker 0: But, they're bringing it to iPad, which actually... It's like, "Oh, I really... I played Hearthstone on the PC, and I was like, 'Alright, this is... yeah, right?

717
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:34,989
Speaker 0: It's just obvious what to do on your

718
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:35,289
Speaker 0: turn.'".

719
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:39,330
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean like Nuroshima Hex, a game that I play all the time because I play it all the time?

720
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,150
Speaker 1: I play it when I'm pooping.

721
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:49,547
Speaker 0: It's not as good as Nuroshima Hex, but because it's online against a real person, it actually might sort of get played as much as Nuroshima Hex.

722
00:37:49,587 --> 00:37:51,350
Speaker 0: because it's on iPad, right?

723
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:57,130
Speaker 0: It's something I can just... I'm laying in bed, turn on the iPad, Hearthstone someone, and then turn the iPad off.

724
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:01,370
Speaker 0: Whereas, if it's on PC and I gotta sit at my desk, no way I'm dedicating that time to Hearthstone.

725
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:01,870
Speaker 1: Yup.

726
00:38:02,352 --> 00:38:04,277
Speaker 1: I mean, granted, he's talking about Civ 5.

727
00:38:04,277 --> 00:38:06,885
Speaker 1: I even play Civ 5 on my laptop, not on my desk.

728
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:08,490
Speaker 1: I'm sitting at my desk, I'm doing something else.

729
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:10,283
Speaker 1: Can't play that on HDPC.

730
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,035
Speaker 0: Nope, nope, nope.

731
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:14,820
Speaker 0: There's an article on Polygon.

732
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:18,210
Speaker 0: They talked to John Romero, and there's a modern picture of John Romero.

733
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,147
Speaker 1: To win the game!

734
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:30,310
Speaker 0: And I just want to point this out because he talks about how fast Doom was and how awesome it was that Doom was fast and every game after Doom was slow.

735
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,661
Speaker 1: John Romero, you're like my spirit animal.

736
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:36,029
Speaker 1: You know what's up!

737
00:38:37,491 --> 00:38:39,718
Speaker 0: Quote, "Doom's speed and movement is super fast.

738
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:41,605
Speaker 0: It only slowed down over the years in other games.

739
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:43,010
Speaker 0: Even Quake is slower than Doom.

740
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:49,130
Speaker 0: Each Quake has gotten progressively slower, and a lot of games just copy how fast people really walk and run.

741
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,018
Speaker 0: When they play Doom, they'll see how crazy fast it is.

742
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,689
Speaker 0: If you don't know the levels and you haven't played a really high speed deathmatch, well, you'll

743
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:55,869
Speaker 0: learn.".

744
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:02,490
Speaker 1: There was a mod for Quake 2, I think it was called Gen, or Generations, and what it was, it was a deathmatch mod.

745
00:39:02,811 --> 00:39:04,690
Speaker 0: Wolfsenstein guy versus Doom guy versus Quake guy.

746
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:06,708
Speaker 1: Quake 1 guy, Quake 2 guy.

747
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:09,109
Speaker 0: Doom guy was best guy.

748
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:19,310
Speaker 1: But they had a switch for LAN mode because the way they coded it, Doom guy was so fast that if you weren't playing on a LAN, shit didn't work.

749
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:22,910
Speaker 1: So you had to slow him down to play over the internet.

750
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:29,090
Speaker 0: He also talks about how his kids play Quake and they also play modern games and whatever.

751
00:39:30,233 --> 00:39:31,828
Speaker 0: Interesting to see what John Romero is up to.

752
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:34,273
Speaker 0: Here's some news.

753
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,397
Speaker 0: Unity, right?

754
00:39:35,477 --> 00:39:38,829
Speaker 0: The game development platform thingy that a lot of people use.

755
00:39:40,092 --> 00:39:43,552
Speaker 0: It's having a big ol' update, Unity 5.

756
00:39:43,552 --> 00:39:46,690
Speaker 0: And there's a ton of stuff in this update that you might care about if you're a developer.

757
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:52,330
Speaker 0: But there's only one really interesting thing in this update for someone who's a game player.

758
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:58,190
Speaker 0: And that is, up until now, Unity lets you target any platform pretty much when you make a game.

759
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,950
Speaker 0: You could be like, build iPhone game, build Xbox game, build PC game, right?

760
00:40:03,492 --> 00:40:09,970
Speaker 0: But, when you wanted to build a web game, you could build a web game that would work in a browser, but you needed a Unity player plug-in thing.

761
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:22,110
Speaker 0: Now they've added it with, I think in cooperation with Mozilla possibly even, Unity 5, you can build a WebGL game that will just work in Firefox with no plug-in whatsoever.

762
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,389
Speaker 0: It's kind of a big deal.

763
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:24,349
Speaker 0: That's pretty huge.

764
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:29,870
Speaker 0: That means it could work in a mobile browser, assuming you have enough video card in your phone.

765
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,070
Speaker 1: And Unity is, if you're making certain kinds of games.

766
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,020
Speaker 0: You have a GPU in your phone.

767
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:40,570
Speaker 1: A lot of you want to make video games, and I can't stress to you enough how bad an idea that might be as a career choice.

768
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:47,330
Speaker 1: But, if you're insistent upon it, Unity's a really good platform to learn and to use to make these things.

769
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:51,670
Speaker 1: There's no point in reinventing the wheel for the kinds of games that most people are making.

770
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,809
Speaker 1: Development frameworks exist for a reason.

771
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:58,484
Speaker 1: And Unity as an environment is, I think, pretty full-featured.

772
00:40:58,544 --> 00:40:59,568
Speaker 1: I actually really like it.

773
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:07,350
Speaker 1: Granted, all I've made is a bunch of pseudo-games where cubes jump up and down on top of other cubes and shoot cubes at each other.

774
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:09,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, Unity is pretty impressive, right?

775
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:13,390
Speaker 0: When it first appeared on the market, all it did was let you make games for its browser plug-in.

776
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,477
Speaker 0: And I was like, that's going to fail.

777
00:41:15,537 --> 00:41:19,130
Speaker 0: Nobody's going to install your ridiculous plug-in to play your game, right?

778
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,212
Speaker 0: This is not going to be it.

779
00:41:20,252 --> 00:41:29,450
Speaker 0: But then what they managed to do is, on the backend side, they turned the development tool into something that can make games for all sorts of targets and not just this plug-in.

780
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,530
Speaker 0: And the plug-in sort of became not the main story anymore, and then that's how it succeeded.

781
00:41:35,352 --> 00:41:38,250
Speaker 0: So, I guess now they're getting rid of the plug-in entirely.

782
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,990
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously this is one of the top gaming engines now.

783
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,730
Speaker 0: I mean, you see more Unity these days than you see Unreal Engine, right?

784
00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:47,560
Speaker 0: You used to be.

785
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:48,209
Speaker 0: That's all you saw.

786
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,270
Speaker 0: Okay, so this story is sort of serious, right?

787
00:41:54,751 --> 00:42:00,470
Speaker 0: But it shows, you know, I guess what's in our future in terms of competitive gaming, right?

788
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:07,510
Speaker 0: So, there was a top League of Legends team in Korea, right, for real serious professional players, right?

789
00:42:08,171 --> 00:42:14,110
Speaker 0: And the manager of the team, so, I mean, this is on the level of, like, NFL team level, right?

790
00:42:14,914 --> 00:42:17,610
Speaker 0: Maybe smaller than that because, you know, but whatever, in terms of money.

791
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,930
Speaker 0: But still, big professional sports, right?

792
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:30,070
Speaker 0: The manager of the team had a plan where the team would get really good, get a really good reputation, then he would make huge bets against the team and they would throw the match.

793
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:31,429
Speaker 0: So, they would get a lot of money.

794
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:32,829
Speaker 1: Black Sox, anyone?

795
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:33,651
Speaker 0: Right.

796
00:42:34,032 --> 00:42:45,830
Speaker 0: So, he had this plan, but regardless of whether his plan was successful or not, because of it, you know, some of the players were extremely upset and, like, attempted suicide and shit, right?

797
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:48,510
Speaker 0: So, this is, like, mad fucked up.

798
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,593
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

799
00:42:50,235 --> 00:43:02,470
Speaker 1: When anything that becomes professional enough to have professional money being injected, to where someone can make their living doing that thing, it brings with it all of the problems of the real world.

800
00:43:03,355 --> 00:43:05,530
Speaker 1: Suddenly, it's not just a game anymore.

801
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:22,129
Speaker 1: And that's actually why I think gaming tournament culture, especially fighting games and MOBAs and things, have such toxic cultures because they're not professional enough to where, I mean, even the worst baseball player who makes it into the real team makes good money.

802
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:24,468
Speaker 1: Like, he's got a good life going on.

803
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:31,389
Speaker 1: But if you're in the professional video gaming circuit and you're not doing super well, you can't make rent.

804
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, they didn't have a sponsor.

805
00:43:33,097 --> 00:43:35,910
Speaker 0: Like, I think this manager took out a loan to pay for them, right?

806
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,027
Speaker 0: So, his plan was to, like, pay for, you know, the whole team, right?

807
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:43,930
Speaker 0: Basically get, you know, the equivalent of the sponsorship money with the illegal bets and whatnot.

808
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:49,650
Speaker 1: But, like, the American football player doesn't need to win the Super Bowl to be able to afford rent for the next three months.

809
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:50,990
Speaker 1: He's set either way.

810
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,723
Speaker 0: But there's still, because it's serious business, right?

811
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:55,230
Speaker 0: And, you know, in the NFL, right?

812
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,733
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah.

813
00:43:56,015 --> 00:43:57,907
Speaker 0: Even if you're the lowest level NFL player, right?

814
00:43:59,013 --> 00:44:02,950
Speaker 0: It's like, you've only got a few years to play and you've got to make all your money in those years.

815
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,389
Speaker 0: And if you're just a nobody, you're not going to make that much money.

816
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,630
Speaker 0: I mean, you're going to make good money, but not millions upon millions.

817
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:18,310
Speaker 0: But if you can somehow take some drugs and cheat and hide injuries and harm yourself, you can get millions upon millions.

818
00:44:18,552 --> 00:44:20,069
Speaker 0: So, that shit still happens, you know.

819
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:21,769
Speaker 0: Drama enters the scene.

820
00:44:22,111 --> 00:44:32,990
Speaker 1: But at least there's more of a veneer, more of an ability to be able to compete primarily because you want to do well at the game and not directly to pay rent.

821
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,110
Speaker 1: There's one more layer there.

822
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:35,370
Speaker 0: Yep.

823
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:46,490
Speaker 0: This is why I think, you know, one of the things, the reason, like, if Netrunner became as big as Magic to where there was, like, money tournaments and it was huge, I don't know if I would do that because all that shit would start to enter the scene.

824
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:53,970
Speaker 0: Also, because, you know, Netrunner is not collectible, everyone who is into Netrunner is in it because winning.

825
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:55,735
Speaker 0: Playing and winning, right?

826
00:44:55,795 --> 00:44:59,710
Speaker 0: Or playing and enjoying the cyberpunk part, but that's less people, right?

827
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:06,110
Speaker 0: There are people who are into Magic just for the collecting and the trading and the, you know, speculating on card values.

828
00:45:06,591 --> 00:45:11,510
Speaker 0: And they're not in it even for the game at all, not even winning or losing it, not even playing it, right?

829
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,530
Speaker 0: So, because we don't have those people in the community, things like this don't happen.

830
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:34,250
Speaker 0: And, you know, you need to have, if you're going to have a professional, you know, situation, you know, a competitive thing built up around a game, you need to have all those structures in place, you know, that the professional sports leagues have, like unions and whatnot, you know?

831
00:45:35,411 --> 00:45:35,981
Speaker 0: And they don't have them.

832
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:43,004
Speaker 1: Well, when you have the money of a professional thing without the professional structure of that thing, there's a reason.

833
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:45,590
Speaker 1: there's laws about betting on sports in the United States.

834
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:46,493
Speaker 1: There's reasons.

835
00:45:46,794 --> 00:45:52,070
Speaker 1: we have all these regulations and rules and unions and everything in professional sports because it's not like other professions.

836
00:45:53,010 --> 00:46:01,330
Speaker 1: A profession that is also competition and entertainment needs a lot of protections or else things can get really toxic really quickly.

837
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:01,850
Speaker 0: Yep.

838
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:09,270
Speaker 0: So this is, this is like, you know, the first, I mean, this might seem like a sort of crazy outrageous story, but this is just like the first, right?

839
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:14,250
Speaker 0: I don't think this is even the first, but it's one of the first, right?

840
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:18,550
Speaker 0: You're going to see a lot more like this unless, uh, things, you know, change.

841
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,913
Speaker 0: Yeah.

842
00:46:18,953 --> 00:46:20,169
Speaker 1: Can't do the big time now.

843
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:20,851
Speaker 0: Yeah.

844
00:46:20,871 --> 00:46:21,613
Speaker 0: All right.

845
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:27,410
Speaker 0: So, um, Walmart is going to let you trade in your used games.

846
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,494
Speaker 1: GameStop stock appears.

847
00:46:29,534 --> 00:46:36,210
Speaker 1: Let me just say, I saw, I saw, I was at a meeting today and I saw a blurb pass by the basis of GameStop just like ruined.

848
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:50,330
Speaker 1: I'm going to look up GameStop right now, but yeah, that GameStop literally now is nothing more than a low rent pawn shop for kids who don't have credit cards or can't buy stuff digitally yet and don't have a Walmart near them.

849
00:46:51,831 --> 00:46:52,509
Speaker 0: So people in the city.

850
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,717
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much though.

851
00:46:54,757 --> 00:46:56,609
Speaker 1: There's a Walmart near New York city.

852
00:46:57,632 --> 00:46:58,036
Speaker 0: Uh, really?

853
00:46:58,056 --> 00:46:58,238
Speaker 0: Yeah.

854
00:46:58,258 --> 00:46:59,630
Speaker 0: Where like New Jersey, Connecticut?

855
00:47:00,191 --> 00:47:01,800
Speaker 1: I think there's one like, Oh yeah.

856
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,570
Speaker 1: Look at, look at that stock drop.

857
00:47:03,993 --> 00:47:06,310
Speaker 0: And that was on the news that Walmart is doing this.

858
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:15,510
Speaker 1: So the people who invest in GameStop, at least enough of them to cause almost a 4% drop, realize that GameStop is just a pawn stop.

859
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,930
Speaker 0: No, you don't say.

860
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:23,069
Speaker 1: I mean, remember Funkoland, AKA the free arcade until...

861
00:47:23,571 --> 00:47:24,375
Speaker 0: I just think it's weird.

862
00:47:24,395 --> 00:47:26,063
Speaker 0: I mean, of course it hurts GameStop.

863
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:27,330
Speaker 0: that Walmart is doing this, right?

864
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,930
Speaker 0: But Walmart wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't lucrative.

865
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:37,724
Speaker 0: It's like, is, is the physical disc game trade still so lucrative and there's not?

866
00:47:37,824 --> 00:47:41,350
Speaker 0: digital game downloading still hasn't just completely taken over?

867
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:41,810
Speaker 1: Yes.

868
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:42,713
Speaker 1: And here's why.

869
00:47:43,174 --> 00:47:49,130
Speaker 1: One, uh, I'm selling my Xbox 360 to one of my coworkers because they don't have a modern console.

870
00:47:49,515 --> 00:47:50,369
Speaker 0: I'm getting rid of mine too.

871
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:51,174
Speaker 1: Yeah.

872
00:47:51,255 --> 00:47:52,342
Speaker 1: I was like, I'll just give it to you.

873
00:47:52,382 --> 00:47:53,509
Speaker 1: He insisted on paying for it.

874
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:54,090
Speaker 1: All right.

875
00:47:54,791 --> 00:48:00,310
Speaker 1: So yeah, the most parents and kids who aren't super into gaming, but like video games just don't give a shit.

876
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,490
Speaker 1: So they're two full generations behind whatever game.

877
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:03,650
Speaker 1: Right.

878
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:13,330
Speaker 0: But you're not buying and selling games back to the store unless you're into games to the point at which you're like, buy a new game, sell it back so you can afford the brand new goddamn game.

879
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:17,550
Speaker 0: Sell it back so you can afford another brand new goddamn game and you're a poor high school kid who doesn't have a lot of money.

880
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:24,010
Speaker 1: So you have a whole market of people who right now are just upgrading to the Xbox 360.

881
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:31,310
Speaker 1: So then they go to GameStop and they buy all the old used games that the gamer guys sold back for pennies on the dollar because they don't care.

882
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:36,069
Speaker 1: They'll go in and be like, yeah, I'll buy, you know, these five games cause they're all five bucks or whatever.

883
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:42,347
Speaker 1: And the kids who are in these families, they'll use their allowance to buy things.

884
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:43,350
Speaker 1: They don't have credit cards.

885
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:43,850
Speaker 0: Nope.

886
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,430
Speaker 1: They can't buy stuff online easily unless they have cool parents.

887
00:48:46,852 --> 00:48:50,109
Speaker 0: So if they do want to buy stuff online, you know what they have to do?

888
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:56,050
Speaker 0: They have to go to GameStop, buy a card, go home, type the code on the card into the Xbone and then buy something.

889
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:56,492
Speaker 0: Yup.

890
00:48:58,127 --> 00:48:58,470
Speaker 0: How interesting.

891
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,109
Speaker 0: If you're going to the store.

892
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:07,830
Speaker 1: The stock was actually as low as this a few days ago and then was on this huge increase and then collapsed on the news today.

893
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:09,567
Speaker 0: Someone called the SEC.

894
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:11,490
Speaker 0: Insider trading.

895
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,288
Speaker 1: Well, no, if that's insider trading, then someone fucked up.

896
00:49:17,536 --> 00:49:19,189
Speaker 1: It shouldn't have been going up if people knew.

897
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:20,592
Speaker 0: Maybe.

898
00:49:20,613 --> 00:49:20,920
Speaker 0: I don't know.

899
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:22,590
Speaker 1: Yeah.

900
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:24,842
Speaker 1: Games just never forget.

901
00:49:24,903 --> 00:49:25,767
Speaker 1: It's not just gaming.

902
00:49:25,787 --> 00:49:26,290
Speaker 1: It's everything.

903
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:32,150
Speaker 1: There's, we're very privileged in the sense that being nerdy type people, I mean, you're listening to a podcast.

904
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:37,469
Speaker 1: You're already in like the upper 0.1% of people who understand technology at all.

905
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:44,370
Speaker 1: So the kinds of people like us have been doing digital distribution for what, five plus years?

906
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,339
Speaker 0: Five?

907
00:49:47,461 --> 00:49:48,770
Speaker 0: How about like 20?

908
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,130
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what, I mean, not everything was available digitally.

909
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:53,921
Speaker 1: Like you couldn't get handheld games digitally until recently.

910
00:49:54,222 --> 00:49:58,542
Speaker 0: Smartphones, there weren't really- There were GBA emulators and like, oh, that GBA.

911
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:00,530
Speaker 0: There were Game Boy emulators in the late 90s.

912
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:00,851
Speaker 1: Okay.

913
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:08,710
Speaker 1: So if you want to count emulators, then yeah, since I had a 486 that could technically- It's been like 98, 99.

914
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:09,032
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

915
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,241
Speaker 1: My Pentium Pro 200 did Nestle so well.

916
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,310
Speaker 1: I was so excited about that.

917
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:14,163
Speaker 0: My Pentium 3450.

918
00:50:14,163 --> 00:50:14,489
Speaker 0: Oh, so good.

919
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:15,011
Speaker 1: Yeah.

920
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:15,735
Speaker 1: No, yeah.

921
00:50:15,755 --> 00:50:18,750
Speaker 1: If you're talking about piracy, then yeah, we've been digital since forever.

922
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,530
Speaker 1: I was pirating movies since the day real media existed.

923
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:23,070
Speaker 0: Okay.

924
00:50:23,091 --> 00:50:25,360
Speaker 0: The day you could like, the Steam came out.

925
00:50:25,782 --> 00:50:27,850
Speaker 0: My Steam account was the first day Steam existed.

926
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,450
Speaker 0: I think that was 02?

927
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:36,150
Speaker 1: But I didn't buy anything through Steam until they had that- I bought Half Life 2 on Steam.

928
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:37,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, the id Software Pack that we all bought.

929
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:41,770
Speaker 0: That was the first non-Valve thing I bought on Steam, was the id Software Pack.

930
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:42,973
Speaker 1: Yeah, the id Software Pack.

931
00:50:43,334 --> 00:50:55,350
Speaker 1: But digital distribution, while it's like the default obvious thing for us, just like YouTube and streaming and Netflix, for the average person, they don't go on the internet every day.

932
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:56,635
Speaker 1: Except at work.

933
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,810
Speaker 0: Like at work, they go on the internet- And at work, their internet is filtered if they even have it.

934
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:04,021
Speaker 1: And at home, they don't go on the internet.

935
00:51:04,242 --> 00:51:05,849
Speaker 1: They don't even- a lot of them don't have PCs.

936
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,376
Speaker 1: They say, "Digital doesn't exist.

937
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:10,867
Speaker 1: If they have a console, it's two generations

938
00:51:11,028 --> 00:51:11,168
Speaker 1: old.".

939
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,097
Speaker 1: So that is the only thing.

940
00:51:13,117 --> 00:51:19,470
Speaker 1: holding these old sort of physical media companies up, is the fact that most people are way behind the curve.

941
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,950
Speaker 1: And that's just in the industrialized world.

942
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,506
Speaker 0: Alright, so final news I have here.

943
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:31,550
Speaker 0: Remember when SimCity came out and everyone was like, "I ain't doing this shit with your forced online.

944
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,244
Speaker 0: Oh look, it doesn't even work because your servers can't handle this.

945
00:51:34,264 --> 00:51:34,888
Speaker 0: Duh.".

946
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:38,706
Speaker 0: And they said, "SimCity can't even be offline.

947
00:51:38,726 --> 00:51:38,968
Speaker 0: It's not

948
00:51:39,008 --> 00:51:39,470
Speaker 0: possible.".

949
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:41,510
Speaker 0: Then someone hacked it to make it offline.

950
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,489
Speaker 0: Oh, look how impossible it is!

951
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:47,466
Speaker 1: We talked about this at length, about why they told that lie.

952
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:53,850
Speaker 0: Well, as of today, SimCity is officially available with offline mode.

953
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:56,038
Speaker 0: It's not like some hack or mod.

954
00:51:56,098 --> 00:51:58,549
Speaker 0: It's like, nope, it just has offline mode now.

955
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:00,186
Speaker 1: Too little, too late.

956
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,390
Speaker 0: Well, obviously it's too little, too late, but it's just hilarious.

957
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:05,359
Speaker 0: Like, this is Daily Show material.

958
00:52:05,399 --> 00:52:07,488
Speaker 0: Like, "SimCity can never work

959
00:52:07,629 --> 00:52:07,870
Speaker 0: offline.".

960
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:10,809
Speaker 0: Today, SimCity releases offline mode.

961
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:13,498
Speaker 0: This game is just designed.

962
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:16,110
Speaker 0: It can't possibly be anything but online all the time.

963
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:39,770
Speaker 1: Their attempt at monetization here, the only reason to make a single player game be like this is either for really restrictive DRM or because they want to be able to sell content later to people locally and they don't want them to be able to cheat and get that content on their own or because they need that social pressure of Farmville-style, like, "Hey, Rim's got the fancy building.

964
00:52:40,931 --> 00:52:44,326
Speaker 1: Your city's connected to his city and you don't have the fancy building.

965
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,070
Speaker 1: It's five bucks.

966
00:52:46,211 --> 00:52:46,534
Speaker 1: It reduces

967
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:46,918
Speaker 1: pollution.".

968
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:49,774
Speaker 1: I don't know.

969
00:52:49,794 --> 00:52:51,423
Speaker 1: SimCity 2000 was the one I played the most.

970
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:53,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

971
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:54,716
Speaker 1: I don't know.

972
00:52:54,736 --> 00:52:56,450
Speaker 1: I mean, I like sim games.

973
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,001
Speaker 0: SimCity 2000 is all you need.

974
00:52:58,182 --> 00:52:59,090
Speaker 0: I don't need anything more than that.

975
00:52:59,171 --> 00:53:00,580
Speaker 1: SimCity 3000 was pretty fun.

976
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,049
Speaker 1: SimCity 4 was actually pretty fun, too.

977
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:03,049
Speaker 0: I never played any of those.

978
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:03,677
Speaker 1: I own them all.

979
00:53:03,718 --> 00:53:04,225
Speaker 1: I played them all.

980
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:04,489
Speaker 1: It just...

981
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,918
Speaker 0: I had a SimCity on my iPhone.

982
00:53:06,938 --> 00:53:08,446
Speaker 0: I think I still have it, technically, right?

983
00:53:08,466 --> 00:53:09,069
Speaker 0: I can just go get it.

984
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:13,748
Speaker 0: And it came out, like, when the iPhone 3G first came out, and meh.

985
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:18,650
Speaker 1: These games just require a lot of time and investment that I'm no longer really willing to put into games.

986
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:19,470
Speaker 0: Pretty much, yeah.

987
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,470
Speaker 1: Even though, lately, I'll put it back into Civ 5, so we'll see.

988
00:53:23,851 --> 00:53:29,390
Speaker 1: But yeah, the DRM thing was a shame and I think that's the only reason I didn't get in on it early and now I've mostly lost interest.

989
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,707
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not gonna buy an EA game no matter what, right?

990
00:53:31,787 --> 00:53:31,969
Speaker 0: So...

991
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:38,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want to reward them at all for their egregious behavior on the front of this particular specific game.

992
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:41,664
Speaker 0: I'm pretty much not gonna buy anything that says EA on it.

993
00:53:41,805 --> 00:53:41,985
Speaker 0: Ever.

994
00:53:42,307 --> 00:53:42,608
Speaker 0: Again.

995
00:53:42,729 --> 00:53:42,990
Speaker 0: Maybe.

996
00:53:44,153 --> 00:53:44,458
Speaker 1: Alright.

997
00:53:44,662 --> 00:53:45,150
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

998
00:53:46,134 --> 00:53:46,630
Speaker 0: Okay, then we're done.

999
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,115
Speaker 1: Any other news?

1000
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,329
Speaker 1: Just peter out here.

1001
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:48,921
Speaker 0: Peter.

1002
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:49,999
Speaker 1: Clicky-clicky.

1003
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:50,607
Speaker 1: Clicky-click.

1004
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:58,870
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1005
