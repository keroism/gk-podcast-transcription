1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,488
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, October 12th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,488 --> 00:00:09,689
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,723 --> 00:00:13,176
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:15,160
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,920
Speaker 0: We're talking about two shows that only one of us watched.

6
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:18,919
Speaker 0: I guess movies.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,560
Speaker 0: The Newish Gundam, Kookaroo's Doan's Island, and Star Trek Prodigy.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,540
Speaker 1: I didn't realize the Star Trek one was a movie.

9
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:29,959
Speaker 0: It's not a Stevie show.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:30,764
Speaker 1: Oh.

11
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:33,878
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:40,940
Speaker 1: So if you listened to our last Geek Nights episode, I talked about the car that appeared under mysterious circumstances.

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,218
Speaker 0: I'm really invested in this.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,080
Speaker 1: That was on Friday night.

15
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:51,319
Speaker 1: It is currently Wednesday evening dusk-ish, and the car is still there.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
Speaker 1: So it's Friday night, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

17
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:56,718
Speaker 1: Car's still there.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,678
Speaker 0: It's kind of amazing.

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,100
Speaker 0: Now it was a holiday weekend, but it is no longer a holiday.

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,919
Speaker 0: It's like regular work time now.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:04,791
Speaker 1: Yeah.

22
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:09,740
Speaker 1: So it's like on the one hand, I just want to wait it out and see what happens and not interfere, right?

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,980
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, I just really want to tell somebody.

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,520
Speaker 1: Not it's like I don't want to tell, you know, the authorities.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,597
Speaker 1: It's like that's right.

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,380
Speaker 1: It's not my business, but I just like I want to find someone who gives it.

27
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:29,880
Speaker 0: I feel like what this warrants is you make a Reddit post in the Astoria Reddit be like, so what's up with this car?

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,367
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's with this car?

29
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,720
Speaker 0: would be a pretty good headline for that post.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,079
Speaker 0: Like, what's the deal with this car?

31
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,499
Speaker 1: I don't know if anyone else will care, but I don't know.

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,400
Speaker 0: I feel like that's the kind of thing that would get a very niche audience.

33
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,899
Speaker 0: that could slowly grow a little bit.

34
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,300
Speaker 0: Depends on how long this lasts.

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,560
Speaker 0: If that car is still there a month from now, suddenly this becomes legendary.

36
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:51,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I could do the mystery of the car.

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to go down and put some chalk on the wheel and the road.

38
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:59,139
Speaker 0: So you'll know if it moved, because what if someone moved it and parked it again in the weird angle?

39
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:00,840
Speaker 1: Does that's not going to happen?

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,740
Speaker 1: I don't think they could.

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,233
Speaker 0: You don't know.

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,679
Speaker 1: Could be it could be a tow truck is going to move that car.

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:14,979
Speaker 0: So speaking of which, my car, you know, the one that we use basically just to go to places that you can't get without a car.

44
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:21,360
Speaker 0: If you live in New York City, like ski mountains and hiking places, I was able to get it out.

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,780
Speaker 0: I haven't used this car in months because I don't drive this car often.

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,518
Speaker 0: Like I pay a lot to keep this car just to use during the winter and like hiking season.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,300
Speaker 0: And I had something happen to me I've never had happen in my entire life.

48
00:02:33,703 --> 00:02:35,660
Speaker 0: I had gas go stale.

49
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,779
Speaker 1: What even happens if that happens?

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,919
Speaker 0: So if you wait long enough, it just won't work.

51
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,880
Speaker 0: Like gasoline actually just stops working.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,480
Speaker 0: It goes stale and as a shelf life, just like anything else.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,280
Speaker 0: Most people will never encounter this because they use their cars.

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Speaker 1: Do you just like siphon all the gas out and pump new gas in?

55
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:55,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much what you have to do if it gets bad.

56
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,459
Speaker 0: But it's not that stale.

57
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,358
Speaker 1: What do you do to dispose of the bad gas?

58
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:03,040
Speaker 0: Uh, dispose of it the same way you dispose of other harmful volatiles.

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,840
Speaker 1: I'm going to have to Google this to learn the chemistry.

60
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,361
Speaker 0: Yep.

61
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:17,760
Speaker 0: So basically, in this case, I didn't have to do anything because I went to get the car to check it out, you know, drive it around a little bit, which you got to do periodically, which the Russian military seems to have not done with all its cars.

62
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,239
Speaker 0: And check engine light came on and I was like, oh.

63
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:27,660
Speaker 0: So I drove to like the auto zone to get the codes pulled because I don't own a thing that'll get the codes out of my car.

64
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,540
Speaker 0: And it says the engine's running lean.

65
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:36,400
Speaker 0: And that actually made sense because there is like an eighth of a tank of gas and that car hasn't moved in a couple of months.

66
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,680
Speaker 0: So that's about the point where the gas would start to go stale.

67
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:47,420
Speaker 0: So all I had to do was fill the tank and it's fine because I can dilute that little bit of stale gas with a whole bunch of good gas.

68
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:54,637
Speaker 0: And I'll be driving the car enough with the hiking coming up and apple pick in and all that nonsense to picking.

69
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:55,180
Speaker 1: time is over.

70
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,960
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of apple picking left.

71
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,300
Speaker 0: There's like two more weeks of some apples, just not the varieties that people tend to be excited about.

72
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,760
Speaker 1: Hardly any varieties.

73
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,700
Speaker 0: Plus, I don't eat that many apples.

74
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,840
Speaker 0: Like I can't eat the number of apples that I would actually pick apple picking.

75
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:15,339
Speaker 0: I go to apple picking to hang out in an orchard to eat cider donuts, to drink cider and to go home.

76
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,320
Speaker 1: Well, anyway, anyway.

77
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,560
Speaker 0: So in the news, there is actually a ton of news going on in the animation space.

78
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:29,845
Speaker 0: But the most important thing that came up very recently is one.

79
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,460
Speaker 0: not that long ago, like 10 days ago, Cartoon Network celebrated its 30th anniversary.

80
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:39,020
Speaker 0: Yep, which is pretty notable.

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,064
Speaker 0: Cartoon Network launched on October 1st in 1992.

82
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:44,460
Speaker 0: Took a little while for it to get going.

83
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:54,179
Speaker 1: And I'll link to an article that kind of talks a big deal for, you know, even when we didn't have cable, right, us 10 year old cartoon watchers who only had Nickelodeon and Saturday morning cartoons.

84
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,859
Speaker 1: Cartoon Network coming into existence is a big deal.

85
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:58,759
Speaker 1: And I was you know, we did an episode on it.

86
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:04,720
Speaker 1: I was very excited when I was finally able to watch it or when I could see it at other people's houses or whatever.

87
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,280
Speaker 0: Right.

88
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:15,440
Speaker 0: So the news today and there's a big Internet discourse about this where like a third of people talking about it are acting like it's the end of the world.

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,180
Speaker 0: Another third of them are trying to downplay it and saying it's not as bad as people are saying.

90
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,260
Speaker 0: You're all just fear mongering.

91
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,919
Speaker 0: And another third of them have no idea what the fuck's going on.

92
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:29,560
Speaker 0: So the best way I can summarize this is this is not just Cartoon Network.

93
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:39,900
Speaker 0: Cartoon Network and what's happening with them and Warner Brothers is like one tiny piece of the broader puzzle, and it's the same puzzle we've been talking about on Geek Nights for as long as there's been Geek Nights.

94
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:43,920
Speaker 0: All media is consolidating into one giant company.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,480
Speaker 0: It's just happening very slowly, but it's happening and it's accelerating.

96
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:52,100
Speaker 0: And this is the kind of thing that happens when media consolidates.

97
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:57,821
Speaker 0: So all the Cartoon Network regulation, all the Cartoon Network stuff seems to be being good.

98
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:02,400
Speaker 0: It's getting merged into like the generic Warner Brothers pipeline.

99
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:06,820
Speaker 0: And Warner Brothers is shutting down tons of stuff and consolidating.

100
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:08,440
Speaker 0: And there's all sorts of nonsense.

101
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,160
Speaker 1: Well, Warner Brothers is like an interesting situation, right?

102
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,877
Speaker 1: Because Warner Brothers discovery was up until recently part of AT&T.

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is already weird and probably should be illegal.

104
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,074
Speaker 0: But I digress.

105
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:22,339
Speaker 0: Right.

106
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,161
Speaker 1: Sure.

107
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:31,440
Speaker 1: But, you know, because of situation, I happen to have a small amount of AT&T stock despite them being evil or whatever.

108
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,348
Speaker 1: Had some.

109
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:32,900
Speaker 1: Right.

110
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:41,007
Speaker 1: And I noticed one day I randomly logged into the E-Trade and I saw that it's like there was a new symbol.

111
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:42,720
Speaker 1: I think I told the story on the show before.

112
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,700
Speaker 1: A new symbol had appeared in my portfolio and I had not made any trades.

113
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:50,059
Speaker 1: And I was like, what the fuck is that?

114
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:53,040
Speaker 1: Did someone break into my account, even though it's got all the security on it?

115
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,683
Speaker 1: What's the deal?

116
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:57,602
Speaker 1: And it turns out that I just, you know, wasn't paying enough attention.

117
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:01,837
Speaker 1: And they split off Warner Brothers discovery from AT&T.

118
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:12,303
Speaker 1: So everyone who had AT&T stock just got free shares effectively of WBD, right, as it split off.

119
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,255
Speaker 1: And, you know, there's reasons.

120
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:16,280
Speaker 1: they say they did this.

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,579
Speaker 1: And I'm sure there's real reasons that are not said.

122
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:19,165
Speaker 1: Right.

123
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:20,800
Speaker 1: But it's a thing that happened.

124
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:30,560
Speaker 1: But then, of course, since then, Warner Brothers Discovery operating as its own deal has, you know, kept coming back in the news, doing various things.

125
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:30,981
Speaker 0: Yep.

126
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:34,800
Speaker 0: Warner Brothers Discovery has canceled tons of projects.

127
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:36,780
Speaker 0: There's been all sorts of shenanigans.

128
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:39,140
Speaker 0: There's a lot you can go read online.

129
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:40,699
Speaker 0: I'm not even going to try to summarize it all.

130
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:41,542
Speaker 1: Yeah.

131
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:46,328
Speaker 1: But if you if you look at the stock price, basically what happened is WBD split off from AT&T, right.

132
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,660
Speaker 1: And then it basically WBD from that point, it just went down.

133
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,019
Speaker 1: Everyone who had it and was paying attention just like sold it as soon as they got it, which is what I should have done.

134
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:01,838
Speaker 1: But I didn't know.

135
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:04,540
Speaker 0: Nothing we're saying is financial advice.

136
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,340
Speaker 0: We're not giving you any investment advice.

137
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,164
Speaker 1: No, I'm just saying.

138
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:09,560
Speaker 1: I'm just saying this is what had no advice.

139
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:11,499
Speaker 1: This is just a tale of what happened.

140
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,140
Speaker 1: This is what has what has occurred.

141
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:19,199
Speaker 0: You know, that's actually a line that I use a lot ever since we watched that video that I made a thing of the day about the monkey.

142
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,180
Speaker 0: It's like I'm not saying this is a good thing that happened.

143
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:24,460
Speaker 0: I am simply saying that it happened.

144
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,599
Speaker 1: This is what has happened.

145
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,060
Speaker 1: There was a split of some kind.

146
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,951
Speaker 1: The stock price went down and then all these news is keep happening about them doing things.

147
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:35,379
Speaker 1: Yeah.

148
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:47,000
Speaker 0: So Warner Brothers TV group chairman Channing Dungy sent an email or a memo to employees announcing eighty two layoffs and forty three.

149
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:47,749
Speaker 1: eighty two.

150
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,498
Speaker 1: That's no big deal.

151
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,001
Speaker 1: Yeah.

152
00:08:49,041 --> 00:09:00,780
Speaker 0: Well, and forty three additional vacant positions that will no longer be filled, which actually represents a twenty six percent reduction in their scripted, unscripted and animated divisions combined.

153
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,679
Speaker 0: Twenty six percent is a pretty big number.

154
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:04,602
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

155
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:07,840
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not a big place, so it's like percentage wise, it's a big number.

156
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:11,020
Speaker 1: But like the news came out today, the Intel is laying off thousands of people.

157
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,502
Speaker 0: Yeah.

158
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,340
Speaker 0: So it's like, but what is that percentage?

159
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,920
Speaker 0: The whole the whole I mean, capitalism is a failure.

160
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:17,780
Speaker 0: That's really the underlying story here.

161
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:26,599
Speaker 0: I'd say a third of all night's news is are actually just us saying capitalism is an egregious failure to humanity in various different ways.

162
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:27,802
Speaker 1: Yes.

163
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:34,446
Speaker 0: But they also announced that they're canceling a bunch of their incubator programs for new talent.

164
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,400
Speaker 0: So Stage 13 is going away.

165
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,460
Speaker 0: The Warner Brothers Writers Workshop is going away.

166
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,840
Speaker 0: The Warner Brothers Directors Workshop is going away.

167
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:52,220
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot of non white creators pointing out that some of these places are where a lot of non white, non wealthy people get their start in this industry.

168
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:56,920
Speaker 0: So this is one of a series of cataclysms.

169
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:05,559
Speaker 0: I feel like the entire entertainment industry, like like broadly globally, is barreling toward bad outcomes.

170
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,219
Speaker 0: But animation seems to be bearing a particular brunt on it right now.

171
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,207
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, this is what we taught.

172
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:14,859
Speaker 1: We've been talking about this since, like, you know, the Napster days.

173
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,682
Speaker 1: I was like, hey, you know, and you know, it's like in the days like Creative Commons is a new thing.

174
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:26,460
Speaker 1: It's like, hey, we have the Internet now, which means that artists no longer are gated from distributing their works to the world.

175
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:26,982
Speaker 1: Right.

176
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,691
Speaker 1: You don't need to, you know, make.

177
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:30,218
Speaker 1: you can make a movie like we used to.

178
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:35,271
Speaker 1: if you made a movie by yourself in the 80s or 90s, it was on a VHS tape that only you and your friends would ever see.

179
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:35,555
Speaker 1: Right.

180
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,063
Speaker 1: And now there's YouTube.

181
00:10:37,364 --> 00:10:42,740
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, when we were kids, we were watching the Saturday morning cartoons.

182
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,000
Speaker 1: So those cartoons made money because they were covered in advertisements on Saturday morning with lots of viewers.

183
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:48,482
Speaker 1: Right.

184
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:52,400
Speaker 1: And then we watched cable cartoons, which is the same thing, basically.

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,344
Speaker 1: Right.

186
00:10:54,846 --> 00:11:00,982
Speaker 1: But it's like now the kids watch the TikToks and the YouTube, which make some monies.

187
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:01,525
Speaker 1: Right.

188
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:05,433
Speaker 1: But they don't make the mega Hollywood monies that a Saturday morning cartoon could make.

189
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:05,880
Speaker 1: Right.

190
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:13,826
Speaker 1: And it's like the mega cartoons, you know, like a big, big, real professionally made show, like a fucking adventure.

191
00:11:13,846 --> 00:11:16,360
Speaker 1: time costs a lot of money to make.

192
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,044
Speaker 1: But is it going to?

193
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:21,783
Speaker 1: how much money is it going to make when you air it or sell it or whatever?

194
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:22,813
Speaker 0: What's the opportunity back?

195
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,941
Speaker 0: What's the opportunity cost compared to taking that money and putting it in the stock market?

196
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:28,903
Speaker 1: Right.

197
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:29,164
Speaker 1: It's like.

198
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:38,580
Speaker 1: it's like so and that same story can be told for all sorts of different forms of video and audio entertainment.

199
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,500
Speaker 0: I think there's something even more in music.

200
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,442
Speaker 1: It's got hit first because the production costs of music are lower, though not always low.

201
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:49,240
Speaker 1: And the distribution costs, especially bandwidth, were much lower.

202
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,823
Speaker 1: Right.

203
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:52,639
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, the music thing happened first.

204
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,042
Speaker 0: Yeah.

205
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,360
Speaker 0: But look what also happened there.

206
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:58,282
Speaker 0: The same thing that drove reality TV and the same thing that's driving a lot of TV changes.

207
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:03,122
Speaker 0: Now, a lot of people don't care that much about what they listen to or what they watch to.

208
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:03,665
Speaker 0: They just want.

209
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:10,870
Speaker 0: they want something like imagine the kind of person who would just turn on the TV and flip through the nerds who were like really caring about the something.

210
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:11,239
Speaker 1: Yeah.

211
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:20,539
Speaker 0: So I think there's something sort of subtle and slightly insidious going on underpinning all of this, because one thing we predicted that we were I still think we're right about.

212
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:33,940
Speaker 0: But technology trends have actually sort of staved off one of the outcomes advertising still remains, I believe, very strongly, largely a scam perpetrated on almost everyone involved in the ecosystem.

213
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:46,660
Speaker 0: But advertising has been the way that most media gets funded, like in America, for most of the history of media in the modern world, like since the advent of radio and television and even newspapers to a big degree.

214
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:54,592
Speaker 0: So all that said, as that ecosystem gets exposed and collapses, you'd think, well, that revenue dries up and media collapses.

215
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:55,820
Speaker 0: and that is happening.

216
00:12:56,321 --> 00:13:03,407
Speaker 0: But because also the technology trend is most people do not have a general purpose computer anymore.

217
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,139
Speaker 0: They're using things like tick tock.

218
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:13,043
Speaker 0: They're being pushed into appliances and gated applications where they can't avoid advertising.

219
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:29,003
Speaker 0: So the media that makes the most money will increasingly be the media that is in those gated ecosystems where advertising is unavoidable, thus propping up the perceived value of advertising and delaying the inevitable destruction of the entire ecosystem.

220
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:40,605
Speaker 1: I think something else that has happened, at least especially in sports entertainment, but also in others, is that there are new ad buyers that have appeared and other ad buyers

221
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:47,118
Speaker 0: like crypto bullshit was a flash in the pan of ad buying, but they bought a lot of ads before NFTs collapsed.

222
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,880
Speaker 1: You know, while gambling is a huge sports, gambling is a huge ad buyer.

223
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:52,442
Speaker 1: Right.

224
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:56,360
Speaker 1: So it's like there are new people who are buying ads.

225
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:57,063
Speaker 1: Right.

226
00:13:57,163 --> 00:14:08,860
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, other people, you know, a lot of people other than like cars and pharmaceutical drugs and certain things like that, you know, sort of large and, you know, I guess, you know, soft drinks or whatever.

227
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,358
Speaker 1: It's like a lot of ad buyers washed up.

228
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,629
Speaker 1: Right.

229
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:13,359
Speaker 1: Or they left.

230
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,882
Speaker 1: They stopped buying ads on television and started buying, you know, targeted Internet ads.

231
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:24,002
Speaker 0: And there was this brief era where most people use the Internet also knew how to block ads.

232
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:29,005
Speaker 0: But now most people use the Internet, only have a phone and have no understand.

233
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,040
Speaker 0: They don't even know that blocking ads is a possibility.

234
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:33,303
Speaker 1: Man.

235
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's all going to be rough.

236
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:42,640
Speaker 1: And in terms of in terms of cartoons, it's like we're only going to get to watch cartoons if someone can make money making cartoons.

237
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:46,740
Speaker 1: And it's very hard to make money making cartoons right now.

238
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,307
Speaker 0: Never mind the fact that companies can mind their back catalogs forever with almost no incremental cost.

239
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,799
Speaker 0: And it's just free money for them.

240
00:14:54,301 --> 00:15:04,620
Speaker 0: And even as consumers, if no anime were ever made again from this point forward, I sadly would still in my entire life not run out of anime.

241
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,659
Speaker 0: I kind of want to watch.

242
00:15:06,661 --> 00:15:09,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I don't watch most of the anime that comes out.

243
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,445
Speaker 0: I think there's some we're going to talk about some anime in a moment that I really want to watch.

244
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:15,779
Speaker 0: And I just haven't had time to watch yet.

245
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,839
Speaker 1: I mean, even a very long time ago, centuries ago, right.

246
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,040
Speaker 1: Renaissance times, there was still already more music books.

247
00:15:25,364 --> 00:15:25,527
Speaker 1: Right.

248
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:26,399
Speaker 1: I didn't have movies.

249
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:27,485
Speaker 1: They didn't have cartoons.

250
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:28,650
Speaker 1: There was.

251
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:35,903
Speaker 1: there were enough books and songs and whatever else they had that you in a human lifetime, especially since the human lives then were shorter.

252
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,479
Speaker 1: You weren't going to get through it all.

253
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,001
Speaker 1: Right.

254
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:48,995
Speaker 1: But now we're at a point where basically even a very unfortunate life that's also a long life.

255
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:49,260
Speaker 1: Right.

256
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,059
Speaker 1: So you don't have a lot of resources, but you're going to be a live a long time.

257
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:57,012
Speaker 1: And even if you're going to work, it's like there is you will never like.

258
00:15:57,754 --> 00:16:08,122
Speaker 0: I think I have enough entertainment to last the rest of my life just just in the videos folder of my NAS.

259
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:13,480
Speaker 1: Right now, there's enough stuff to last several lifetimes for basically anybody.

260
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:14,002
Speaker 1: Right.

261
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:15,667
Speaker 1: It's like so at the so.

262
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:26,442
Speaker 1: how much money in a capitalist society, right, where we're not just we're not putting, you know, just valuing the creation of new art on its own, right?

263
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:40,740
Speaker 0: Only valuing how popular is your art, especially when the majority of people consuming art don't actually care that much about what particular thing they consume, which you may think that sounds crazy.

264
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:44,280
Speaker 0: You're listening to a weird podcast by two guys like us.

265
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,080
Speaker 0: You are already such an extreme edge case that you are irrelevant to capitalism.

266
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:49,941
Speaker 1: All right.

267
00:16:50,021 --> 00:17:00,145
Speaker 1: So speaking of cartoons making any money, for some reason, this anime season, there must be some way that anime are making money because they're sure are making a lot of them.

268
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:02,160
Speaker 0: Well, they don't pay anyone who makes anime anything.

269
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:04,339
Speaker 0: So that'll eventually dry up on its own.

270
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,343
Speaker 1: Right.

271
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:08,800
Speaker 1: You know, a lot of them are propped up by sponsors or whatnot.

272
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:27,180
Speaker 1: But anyway, this anime season that just started like right now is quite unusual in that I'm counting at least six to eight shows that are worth like me paying it personally, keeping notice of if not just watching.

273
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:27,782
Speaker 1: Right.

274
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,280
Speaker 1: Which is a very large number.

275
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:36,440
Speaker 1: The typical anime season, usually there's like two to three shows that maybe I'm thinking about a little bit.

276
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,060
Speaker 0: Remember when we used to do, we'd judge anime by its cover.

277
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:43,940
Speaker 0: We were really rarely wrong and there'd always be two or three like every season.

278
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,739
Speaker 1: This season has a lot.

279
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,600
Speaker 1: So what is out this season?

280
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,920
Speaker 1: So there's several series that are getting sort of additional seasons.

281
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,281
Speaker 1: Right.

282
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:56,828
Speaker 1: I think there's a new Golden Kamuy season, which is something I thought about watching.

283
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:57,940
Speaker 1: It's a borderline one.

284
00:17:58,725 --> 00:17:58,927
Speaker 0: Right.

285
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:00,040
Speaker 0: That's for when I'm retired.

286
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

287
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:07,760
Speaker 1: Mob Psycho, which I watched the first season of, has, I think, a third season coming out now.

288
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,446
Speaker 0: That show's great.

289
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:09,820
Speaker 0: I didn't even finish the first season.

290
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,640
Speaker 0: I just haven't had time.

291
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,424
Speaker 1: Yeah.

292
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:12,498
Speaker 1: I mean, it was OK.

293
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:17,200
Speaker 1: I didn't really feel compelled to watch the second season, but I know it's a big deal show for a lot of people.

294
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:19,137
Speaker 1: So it's worth paying attention to.

295
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:31,499
Speaker 1: The Spy X Family, which I've now watched three episodes of in the first season, which I know is a big deal for a lot of people, is definitely the kind of show we would instantly show at the anime club if we were still running it.

296
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,389
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.

297
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,120
Speaker 1: It's a big time.

298
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:33,421
Speaker 1: Right.

299
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:34,931
Speaker 1: OK, but now what?

300
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:36,240
Speaker 1: what other shows are right?

301
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,271
Speaker 1: Oh, there's that pop team epic, you know, that really one that's like the wacky comedy one.

302
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:41,677
Speaker 1: Right.

303
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,217
Speaker 1: That one has a new season going on right now.

304
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:49,760
Speaker 1: Yo, a pedal, which I care about finally has a new season.

305
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,899
Speaker 1: They ended the previous season, I guess, a few years back.

306
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:54,387
Speaker 1: All right.

307
00:18:54,427 --> 00:18:56,639
Speaker 1: They ended that previous season in the middle of a race.

308
00:18:57,722 --> 00:19:00,599
Speaker 0: I assume that they will never finish this race.

309
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:06,363
Speaker 1: No, the new season starting like in like less than a day or like it already started, I think maybe.

310
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,598
Speaker 1: And I'm pretty sure it just picks right up where they left off in the middle of that race.

311
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,150
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:12,660
Speaker 0: All right.

313
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,380
Speaker 0: So I doubt that season will finish the race.

314
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,340
Speaker 0: I think I think that whole season is going to get to the final of the race.

315
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,607
Speaker 1: There's been enough seasons.

316
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:21,639
Speaker 1: They've already finished a handful of races.

317
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:26,779
Speaker 0: I mean, Initial D got more car races done than they just took a few years.

318
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,347
Speaker 1: They just took a few years off.

319
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,600
Speaker 1: They're way behind the manga, as far as I'm aware.

320
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,541
Speaker 1: All right.

321
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:37,220
Speaker 1: That remake that anniversary remake of Urusei Yatsura.

322
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,788
Speaker 0: I want to watch that.

323
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,160
Speaker 0: That looks so good.

324
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,429
Speaker 0: The animation looks so good.

325
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,800
Speaker 0: The voice acting's not sublime.

326
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:45,679
Speaker 1: You know, if it's not any good, you can just watch.

327
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:52,860
Speaker 0: But it looks like just judging it by its cover, it is the exact inverse of what happened with Sailor Moon Crystal.

328
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,900
Speaker 1: Somehow, I don't know how the fuck this happened, right?

329
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:00,399
Speaker 1: Anyone remembered this at all.

330
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:05,903
Speaker 1: But I encountered at least one or two people outside my usual circle who remembered this.

331
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:07,460
Speaker 1: And I was like, wow, I'm not the only one.

332
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:07,901
Speaker 1: All right.

333
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:12,140
Speaker 1: So there's a show from way back, way back called Digi Carrot.

334
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,699
Speaker 1: So this show.

335
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

336
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:21,660
Speaker 1: So this show was just some sort of comedy short series.

337
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,565
Speaker 0: If you even know what we're talking about, your back definitely hurt when you woke up this morning.

338
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:27,880
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

339
00:20:29,622 --> 00:20:33,680
Speaker 1: And basically there was a. there was a I don't know if there still is, but there was.

340
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:38,080
Speaker 1: it might still exist, a chain of nerdy stores in Japan called Gamers.

341
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,440
Speaker 1: Like Gamers is the name of the store, a physical retail store.

342
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:49,200
Speaker 1: And the store had like a mascot that was, you know, this Digi Carrot cat girl kind of character with bells on her head or whatever.

343
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:50,422
Speaker 1: Right.

344
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:53,359
Speaker 0: The other Robbie and Rose, the rabbit that I guess her nemesis.

345
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:55,303
Speaker 1: I don't know.

346
00:20:55,383 --> 00:21:00,303
Speaker 1: But there was like a, you know, they made an anime series like based on this character.

347
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:05,784
Speaker 1: And now there's like a new remake of it for the anniversary or something like that.

348
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:17,720
Speaker 1: And it's it's basically the same thing as like I don't know if people realize the tick, you know, the blue guy that there was a comic book store in the United States called New England Comics and the tick was like their mascot.

349
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:23,513
Speaker 1: And they would use the tick as like a parody superhero in their in like their advertising flyers.

350
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:24,180
Speaker 1: Right.

351
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:28,720
Speaker 1: And then somebody made a comic, a real comic book series with the tick.

352
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:31,300
Speaker 1: And then it became a cartoon and became a TV show.

353
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,124
Speaker 1: And then it be right.

354
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:37,179
Speaker 1: And Digi Carrot is basically the same deal where some store mascot became a thing.

355
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:40,611
Speaker 1: There were a lot better mascots that never became.

356
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,760
Speaker 1: that had a narrative series.

357
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,940
Speaker 1: It's like there's no fucking Tony the Tiger comic or cartoon.

358
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,684
Speaker 1: It's just commercial.

359
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:53,200
Speaker 0: Well, the reason they haven't done that, I assume, is solely because so many people are so openly horny for Tony.

360
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:54,535
Speaker 1: Just make a horny one.

361
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:54,839
Speaker 1: Yeah.

362
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,325
Speaker 0: Lean into it.

363
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:59,800
Speaker 0: To make me the product manager, I will make you so much goddamn money.

364
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,540
Speaker 0: That demographic has unlimited resources.

365
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:04,415
Speaker 1: The New York Rangers.

366
00:22:04,597 --> 00:22:04,840
Speaker 1: Right.

367
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,165
Speaker 1: You know, it's hockey season now.

368
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,646
Speaker 1: We just won big first game undefeated New York Rangers.

369
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:10,640
Speaker 1: Yeah.

370
00:22:11,922 --> 00:22:16,320
Speaker 1: They are leaning hard into the Cried Vantage ad bromance.

371
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:16,804
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

372
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:17,108
Speaker 1: Right.

373
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,320
Speaker 1: In the social media.

374
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,679
Speaker 1: They are not shying away.

375
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:25,457
Speaker 1: It was amazing to see that they find no reason that Frosted Flakes could not do the exact same thing.

376
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:29,220
Speaker 0: Anyway, give me the grainy anime.

377
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:30,104
Speaker 1: Yeah.

378
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,400
Speaker 1: So did you care remake of some kind or new season or something?

379
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:34,250
Speaker 1: What the hell?

380
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:34,880
Speaker 1: Like what?

381
00:22:36,843 --> 00:22:40,900
Speaker 1: And then, of course, the number one, you know, cannot be ignored.

382
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,199
Speaker 1: The Chainsaw Man anime has begun.

383
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,343
Speaker 0: Yeah.

384
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:48,260
Speaker 1: Chainsaw Man is the biggest deal in the anime manga world.

385
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,326
Speaker 0: I got to finish reading the manga because I feel like we should do a final thoughts, like full review of it.

386
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:56,120
Speaker 1: And I read the whole first manga series.

387
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,760
Speaker 1: Another manga series is coming.

388
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:03,202
Speaker 1: And, you know, who knows how much of the anime, the manga, the anime season will cover.

389
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,360
Speaker 1: But yeah, the first episode is out.

390
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:06,820
Speaker 0: Yep.

391
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:13,199
Speaker 0: And also, don't forget, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, which I think both my mom and dad will also be into.

392
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,080
Speaker 1: I don't think that counts as like current anime season, but I do want to watch it.

393
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:17,680
Speaker 1: Yeah.

394
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:24,499
Speaker 0: I mean, it is of all the animated things that I could watch right now, regardless of where and how I watch them.

395
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:33,420
Speaker 0: That's actually at the top of the list for me, because that is the ultra-violent sci-fi type of anime that got me into anime when I was in fourth grade.

396
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,300
Speaker 0: Like that is the shit.

397
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,660
Speaker 1: I don't think it's going to be more ultra-violent than Chainsaw Man.

398
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:44,000
Speaker 0: It is very much monofilament whip, the anime.

399
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:46,433
Speaker 1: Chainsaw.

400
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:48,560
Speaker 1: Monofilament whip.

401
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,780
Speaker 1: The bad guy in Chainsaw Man is the gun devil.

402
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:53,264
Speaker 0: Yeah.

403
00:23:54,006 --> 00:24:07,240
Speaker 0: I just want to remind you, anyone out there, if you if you imagine what cyberpunk is to people of our generation, we think of a little chain gun called Reason and we think about monofilament whips.

404
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,376
Speaker 0: Now, fucking badass, they sound like they are.

405
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:12,664
Speaker 0: But yeah, there is.

406
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:17,321
Speaker 0: there is a lot of good anime to watch, irrespective of the doom and gloom.

407
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:19,420
Speaker 0: we just talked about of capitalism destroying anything.

408
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:23,612
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wonder when is capitalism going to be able to destroy anime?

409
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:26,829
Speaker 0: or will the passion keep it going?

410
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:27,919
Speaker 1: I don't know.

411
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:45,510
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day, so I can't use that PBS space time that I use that I watch and I used once because, you know, we have a rule.

412
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,449
Speaker 0: Am I going to keep using the same channel over and over again?

413
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,829
Speaker 0: PBS has a parallel channel with a different guy so I can talk about it.

414
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,969
Speaker 0: There is PBS Eons, different guy.

415
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:58,210
Speaker 0: And this video is fascinating.

416
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:08,130
Speaker 0: So it's kind of topical because we're, you know, years into basically the most the biggest pandemic in like modern history in the world.

417
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:12,130
Speaker 0: And this video is about the biggest pandemic ever.

418
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:32,830
Speaker 0: There was a pandemic with a virus that lasted at least 15 million years and was so absolutely devastating that almost all mammals alive today are the ancestors of the few that survived this 15 million year pandemic.

419
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:35,287
Speaker 1: So but mammals somehow made it.

420
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:37,609
Speaker 0: Yes, because a lot of them didn't.

421
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:43,010
Speaker 0: And this video talks about how we figured out that this disease even existed.

422
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,528
Speaker 0: And it is records.

423
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:45,091
Speaker 0: It is.

424
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:53,515
Speaker 0: This is remnants of the adaptations that allowed certain orders of mammals to survive.

425
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:55,550
Speaker 0: This are in our DNA today.

426
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,250
Speaker 0: And we found these fragments in like every mammal.

427
00:25:59,812 --> 00:26:04,649
Speaker 0: And then we found that the very small number of mammals that do not have it.

428
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:09,730
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of stuff I do not understand enough to even briefly summarize.

429
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,570
Speaker 0: The video is only 10 minutes long.

430
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,149
Speaker 0: It does a way better job than I possibly could.

431
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,970
Speaker 0: This is so fascinating.

432
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,132
Speaker 0: Just watch it.

433
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:23,848
Speaker 0: But, yeah, 15 million years, hopefully coronavirus, maybe in like 100 years, will deal with it.

434
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:26,770
Speaker 0: Maybe 50, maybe 20.

435
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,251
Speaker 1: I don't know.

436
00:26:29,096 --> 00:26:38,610
Speaker 0: At least a ton of people I know got COVID relatively recently at work, and I did not, despite being directly, deeply exposed to all of those people.

437
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:42,290
Speaker 0: And the only difference between me and them, I got the new booster.

438
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:43,294
Speaker 0: None of them did.

439
00:26:43,455 --> 00:26:47,050
Speaker 0: So if you did not get the new coronavirus booster, go get it.

440
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,149
Speaker 0: Like, do not wait.

441
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,970
Speaker 1: All right, so I don't think I've used this guy as a thing of the day before.

442
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,410
Speaker 0: You've talked about it with me, but I don't.

443
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think you've actually talked about it.

444
00:26:57,652 --> 00:27:04,430
Speaker 1: There is an Internet creator primarily on TikTok, but also a YouTube channel where he sometimes cross posts his content.

445
00:27:05,114 --> 00:27:06,309
Speaker 1: And I become a huge fan.

446
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,172
Speaker 1: Right.

447
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:11,010
Speaker 1: This guy, I think his real name is Masoud Boumgard.

448
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:12,630
Speaker 1: He's a stand up comedian.

449
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:18,770
Speaker 1: I think he's from South Africa, I think, because I watch some of his stand up on YouTube and that's what he mentions it once or twice.

450
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,252
Speaker 1: Right.

451
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:20,289
Speaker 1: So I think that's where he is.

452
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:21,247
Speaker 1: Not 100 percent sure.

453
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:25,930
Speaker 1: And he has created a character.

454
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:26,993
Speaker 1: Right.

455
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:32,149
Speaker 1: It's sort of like Uncle Roger, right, where he's like, it's actually a stand up comedian who's created a character that they pretend to be.

456
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:33,670
Speaker 1: And that's the joke.

457
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:34,012
Speaker 1: Right.

458
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:37,510
Speaker 1: And the character he has created is self help sing, right?

459
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:38,555
Speaker 1: S-I-N-G-H.

460
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:41,590
Speaker 1: And he's an alternative life coach.

461
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:48,010
Speaker 1: So if you think if you're going to parody those self help guru type people.

462
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,771
Speaker 1: Right.

463
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:50,510
Speaker 1: Well, those people are all full of shit.

464
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:52,569
Speaker 1: So if you tried to parody them.

465
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:53,312
Speaker 1: Right.

466
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:58,510
Speaker 1: It's like it's going to be one of those situations where you can't tell the parody apart from the reality.

467
00:27:58,672 --> 00:27:58,773
Speaker 1: Right.

468
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,388
Speaker 1: You're just going to end up being one of them.

469
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:09,370
Speaker 1: So what he's done is sort of genius in that by being it's like if you are alternative, alternative medicine would just be medicine.

470
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:13,930
Speaker 1: So an alternative self help guru is just a legitimate.

471
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,810
Speaker 1: So like someone who will actually help you and give you good advice.

472
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:18,196
Speaker 1: Right.

473
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:18,600
Speaker 1: Right.

474
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:27,644
Speaker 1: And so all his videos are pretty much the philosophy that I already had in life just being told to me.

475
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:30,315
Speaker 1: He's like.

476
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:32,650
Speaker 1: he's like, fuck the work deadlines.

477
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,389
Speaker 1: Nobody will actually die.

478
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,254
Speaker 1: Right.

479
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:38,989
Speaker 1: It's like if you have a shitty day, go home and go to bed.

480
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:52,533
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, it's like all this really common sense advice you should actually follow presented as if it's not good advice you shouldn't follow from some weird self help guy.

481
00:28:52,954 --> 00:29:00,088
Speaker 0: And that is that is a magic combination of being parody, but also being actually legit like that is hard to do.

482
00:29:01,211 --> 00:29:04,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I really have become a big fan of this guy.

483
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,149
Speaker 0: I mean, his philosophy is very much like how I live my life.

484
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,733
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty.

485
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:14,670
Speaker 1: it's like if you need a real self help guru, you need the alternative self help guru because the real ones are bullshit.

486
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,112
Speaker 0: Right.

487
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:15,987
Speaker 0: So what did I tell you?

488
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,611
Speaker 0: Because I like someone I was doing some mentoring for in their career a few weeks ago.

489
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:27,419
Speaker 0: And I basically said the company won't burn down if this project doesn't go exactly right.

490
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:28,510
Speaker 0: Like that's right.

491
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:36,610
Speaker 0: And if the company would burn down because this project doesn't go exactly right, you need to be paid way more money because this is a really important project.

492
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:37,651
Speaker 1: Yeah.

493
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:38,194
Speaker 1: What are the other?

494
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:43,230
Speaker 1: if everyone is depending on this thing happening on a certain day, otherwise a disaster will happen.

495
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:48,134
Speaker 1: Then that means you are so critical and so important that you should be paid a zillion dollars.

496
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:52,292
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, like the star franchise athlete on a team or something.

497
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:53,639
Speaker 0: I would say that there is.

498
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,174
Speaker 0: there are a few cases where society gets that wrong.

499
00:29:56,214 --> 00:29:57,370
Speaker 0: That's a whole different conversation.

500
00:29:57,471 --> 00:29:59,310
Speaker 0: Like teachers should be paid a lot.

501
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,354
Speaker 0: They're very important.

502
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:06,348
Speaker 1: All I'm saying is that if everyone followed the advice of self-help, saying the world, our society would be incredible.

503
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:14,210
Speaker 0: Well, because remember the thing about self-help, like actual self-help, not fake self-help is similar to psychotherapy and everything else.

504
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:22,490
Speaker 0: You can't therapy your way out of the crushing despair caused directly by capitalism and a cruel and indifferent society.

505
00:30:22,992 --> 00:30:28,673
Speaker 0: But you can react to those evil and dangerous pressures in a more healthy manner.

506
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:30,910
Speaker 0: You can't solve the problem, but you can change.

507
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,891
Speaker 0: You can try to change your attitude about how you react to the problem you can't solve.

508
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:42,699
Speaker 1: I'll always remember the mural that was painted, you know, nearby some years back that said anxiety was.

509
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,530
Speaker 1: it said anxiety is normal in an unjust society.

510
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:46,635
Speaker 1: Yup.

511
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:48,210
Speaker 1: It's like this injustice.

512
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:50,550
Speaker 1: If you don't stop the injustice, of course, it's going to be.

513
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:56,569
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if you just try to stop the anxiety and let the injustice continue, they ain't going to work.

514
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,010
Speaker 0: Yup.

515
00:30:57,994 --> 00:31:00,703
Speaker 0: So in the news, let's see the.

516
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:05,010
Speaker 0: the panel Emily and I did at PAX West is, of course, on our website.

517
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,370
Speaker 0: The Book Club book is Binti, which read all three.

518
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:14,570
Speaker 0: It'll take you like three hours, maybe six hours total if you're a slow reader.

519
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,734
Speaker 0: It's real good.

520
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:18,950
Speaker 0: We'll probably do the show on it next week on Thursday.

521
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,908
Speaker 0: I see no reason not to.

522
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:21,948
Speaker 1: Unless something else comes up.

523
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, something else comes up.

524
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:27,214
Speaker 0: I didn't do the thing that might have gotten in the way of this episode because nobody else wanted to go.

525
00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:33,070
Speaker 0: And also it is crazy windy outside, which might have made that event a little bit difficult to attend comfortably.

526
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:34,557
Speaker 1: Yeah.

527
00:31:34,618 --> 00:31:35,530
Speaker 1: Why not have it on a Wednesday?

528
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:36,412
Speaker 1: Yeah.

529
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:41,030
Speaker 0: But otherwise, I guess you'll have to pick the next book club book.

530
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:41,929
Speaker 0: Are you going to do the choice?

531
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,090
Speaker 1: I already have to two books selected.

532
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:44,792
Speaker 0: Yes.

533
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:47,889
Speaker 0: I also have two books selected for the following one.

534
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:50,488
Speaker 0: It's going to be a fun time.

535
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:58,190
Speaker 0: So if you don't remember, the way we're going to do the book club now is whoever's turned it is to pick has to choose two books.

536
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,970
Speaker 0: And the other of us chooses which of the two.

537
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,550
Speaker 0: It's an I slice you pick situation.

538
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:06,469
Speaker 1: I cut you choose.

539
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:06,892
Speaker 0: Yep.

540
00:32:07,438 --> 00:32:08,349
Speaker 0: Well, we'll see how it goes.

541
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,069
Speaker 0: And otherwise, websites coming along, we got a bunch of stuff going on.

542
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,888
Speaker 0: Stay tuned for there will be gig nights panels at PAX Unplugged.

543
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:19,450
Speaker 0: Maybe there'll be Rym and Scott together.

544
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,289
Speaker 0: Maybe it'll just be Rym as the last several PAXs have been.

545
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,210
Speaker 0: The world wonders and we will see how that goes.

546
00:32:25,531 --> 00:32:26,286
Speaker 0: But that's not now.

547
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:32,810
Speaker 0: And we don't have any major hiatus coming up except for the regularly scheduled ones around the end of the year holidays.

548
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,270
Speaker 0: So with that, let's talk about some shows.

549
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,590
Speaker 0: So you want to talk about Gundam first?

550
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,750
Speaker 0: Then I can talk about Star Trek.

551
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:38,792
Speaker 1: Yeah.

552
00:32:38,872 --> 00:32:41,268
Speaker 1: So this so so people are aware, right?

553
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,470
Speaker 1: The original Mobile Suit Gundam, right?

554
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:47,309
Speaker 1: The original TV series from nineteen seventy nine.

555
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:47,951
Speaker 1: Right.

556
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:54,010
Speaker 1: When that show came out, the art director of that show.

557
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:56,021
Speaker 1: Right.

558
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,090
Speaker 1: What was his name?

559
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,368
Speaker 1: I always forget his name, even though it's right there.

560
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:02,830
Speaker 1: Oh, Yoshikazu Yasuhiko.

561
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:03,450
Speaker 1: Right.

562
00:33:04,756 --> 00:33:08,230
Speaker 1: He is also the person who made the Gundam the origin manga.

563
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:15,370
Speaker 1: And just so we get this out of the way, if you want to experience the story of the original Gundam, right.

564
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,970
Speaker 1: Char, Amuro, all that shit.

565
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:18,531
Speaker 1: Right.

566
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:21,890
Speaker 1: The manga is the best rendition, period.

567
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,451
Speaker 1: Right.

568
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,770
Speaker 1: The three compilation movies being the second best rendition anyway.

569
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,210
Speaker 1: But when they were making that original TV series, right.

570
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,889
Speaker 1: The art director, Yasuhiko, he got sick around episode fifteen or so.

571
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:36,611
Speaker 1: Right.

572
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:43,830
Speaker 1: At least when they were working on those episodes and he was out and they, you know, they were outsourcing some animation and stuff and he just wasn't there.

573
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:46,129
Speaker 1: For a set for a few episodes or whatever.

574
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,230
Speaker 1: In episode fifteen, which was titled Kukunu's Dawn's Island.

575
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:55,549
Speaker 1: It was this little story about an island that they went to and whatnot.

576
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:59,223
Speaker 1: That episode was animated poorly.

577
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,247
Speaker 1: Very poorly.

578
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:11,829
Speaker 1: If you've seen, you've probably seen these meme images of like, you know, the original Gundam with like its head drawn very stupidly.

579
00:34:13,112 --> 00:34:17,670
Speaker 1: If you see the image, you might recognize this is not that uncommon in anime.

580
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:22,414
Speaker 0: There are almost any long running or major show will have like the episodes that are drawn.

581
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,369
Speaker 0: weird for some reason.

582
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:24,333
Speaker 1: Right.

583
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:28,190
Speaker 1: Well, anyway, that image is from this episode.

584
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:32,010
Speaker 1: It's just really bad animation in this episode.

585
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:42,770
Speaker 1: And because of the infamy of this episode, when the show was released in other countries, such as the US, that episode fifteen was not included.

586
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:47,896
Speaker 1: And it didn't really matter that it wasn't included because it was sort of like the standalone side story deal.

587
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:51,730
Speaker 1: that didn't have a huge impact on the overall plot.

588
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:52,927
Speaker 1: You weren't really missing much.

589
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:53,992
Speaker 1: Right.

590
00:34:54,152 --> 00:34:59,214
Speaker 1: Like the compilation movies don't really include anything that happened in that episode.

591
00:34:59,435 --> 00:34:59,696
Speaker 1: Right.

592
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:00,943
Speaker 1: It's like they were.

593
00:35:00,964 --> 00:35:02,050
Speaker 1: it was compiled out.

594
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,870
Speaker 1: So because of that, it became infamous.

595
00:35:06,132 --> 00:35:06,314
Speaker 1: Right.

596
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:08,189
Speaker 1: Like we want to see the lost episode.

597
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:15,909
Speaker 0: You know, spoilers, most things that are infamous and they're not actually worth seeing anyway.

598
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:27,150
Speaker 1: So for some reason, due to the infamy of this episode, right, they did what was sort of like the opposite of a compilation movie is like an expansion movie.

599
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:32,119
Speaker 1: It came out this past summer, right, in Japan is.

600
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:48,850
Speaker 1: they made a whole movie, right, a script of that episode and stretching it out to like, you know, movie length and producing it with modern animation, some CG robots a little bit, you know.

601
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:51,929
Speaker 0: Now, I got to say, that is a pretty cool thing to do.

602
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:54,730
Speaker 0: And I would like to see that happen to other things.

603
00:35:55,772 --> 00:35:56,014
Speaker 1: Right.

604
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:58,050
Speaker 1: So they just took this episode and they stretched it out.

605
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:08,029
Speaker 1: And I'm like, man, it's like instead of compilation movies, you try to take a whole like forty nine, thirty nine episode series, twenty six episodes and squish it so someone can watch it in less time.

606
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:09,810
Speaker 1: What if you did an expansion?

607
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:10,470
Speaker 1: Right.

608
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:14,870
Speaker 1: Why not take every episode of Evangelion and make each one a movie?

609
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:16,408
Speaker 1: Ninety minutes each.

610
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:17,913
Speaker 1: Right.

611
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:21,910
Speaker 0: That was a trend for a brief time in anime.

612
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,077
Speaker 0: Remember, there was Tenji Muyo, the

613
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:24,580
Speaker 0: O.A.V.,

614
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,359
Speaker 0: and then there was Tenji Muyo, the TV series that was just spread out.

615
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,950
Speaker 1: and was it twenty six movies?

616
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:33,656
Speaker 0: It was basically.

617
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,609
Speaker 0: they took a short O.A.V.

618
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,070
Speaker 0: and expanded it into a long, boring TV show.

619
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,509
Speaker 0: And the same thing happened with El Hazzar.

620
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:47,970
Speaker 1: We've got, you know, you got your Futurama and your Adventure Time, you know, movies that happened after the TV series is right.

621
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:49,389
Speaker 1: But those are only a handful.

622
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:56,190
Speaker 0: It was like, no, take like the Puhoi episode of Adventure Time, which is one of the more important and famous episodes.

623
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,329
Speaker 0: That's the Pillow People episode.

624
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:01,468
Speaker 0: I have to keep saying that because apparently no one remembers that it's called Puhoi, except me.

625
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:07,315
Speaker 0: I don't know why I remember that, but imagine if that was an hour and a half long movie.

626
00:37:07,618 --> 00:37:08,530
Speaker 0: That would be fantastic.

627
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,070
Speaker 1: So anyway, they took this episode that was infamous.

628
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,290
Speaker 1: They expanded it and fleshed it out to be a whole movie.

629
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:20,982
Speaker 1: And when the movie starts, right, it says this is a retelling of episode fifteen of Mobile Suit Gundam.

630
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:21,570
Speaker 1: Right.

631
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:22,606
Speaker 1: And now we're starting.

632
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:22,830
Speaker 1: Right.

633
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,662
Speaker 1: It's like it doesn't pretend that like, you know, any.

634
00:37:25,883 --> 00:37:29,390
Speaker 1: it's like it expects you to have just watched episodes one through fourteen.

635
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,268
Speaker 1: It's not to know who these characters are.

636
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:32,214
Speaker 1: Right.

637
00:37:32,535 --> 00:37:37,969
Speaker 1: Like you can still enjoy the movie not knowing who the characters are because you'll know that like, oh, that's a Gundam pilot, I guess.

638
00:37:38,314 --> 00:37:38,537
Speaker 1: Right.

639
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:39,490
Speaker 1: I guess that's the captain.

640
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:40,808
Speaker 1: I guess that's their friend.

641
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:51,434
Speaker 1: Like there won't be any meaning to those characters because those characters that are the Gundam characters don't have any character development or exposition in the episode.

642
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:52,686
Speaker 1: Like you're supposed to know who they are.

643
00:37:53,891 --> 00:38:04,050
Speaker 1: But other than not knowing who they are, everything else about the plot, you know, the new characters that are introduced just for the movie, et cetera, et cetera, like you can completely understand the story.

644
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:05,650
Speaker 1: It's totally self-contained.

645
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:07,609
Speaker 1: It begins, middles, ends.

646
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:15,550
Speaker 1: You know, you can watch this, but it obviously will have much more meaning if you know anything about the original Gundam.

647
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:20,850
Speaker 1: And, you know, is this some great anime movie?

648
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:24,409
Speaker 1: Like, you know, the ones we say, oh, you got to go to the theater and see them.

649
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:36,150
Speaker 1: No, it's, it's a TV episode that's just way better produced and bigger and better and nicer and, you know, well done.

650
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:38,930
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's worth seeing, I guess.

651
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:49,210
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's not run out and see, like we say for, you know, the Hosoda movies and the, you know, the Yuasa movies and the Miyazaki movies and all those.

652
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:50,935
Speaker 1: Right.

653
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,069
Speaker 1: But, yeah, I mean, there are.

654
00:38:54,651 --> 00:39:03,330
Speaker 1: I haven't seen the original old bad episode, so I don't know, like, what things were added, what things are removed, if any, what things were changed.

655
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:08,550
Speaker 0: But, you know, I mean, that old episode is probably only twenty three minutes long.

656
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,175
Speaker 0: You could just go.

657
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:10,368
Speaker 1: Yes, indeed it is.

658
00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:14,969
Speaker 1: But, you know, I still enjoyed it.

659
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,351
Speaker 1: Right.

660
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:19,330
Speaker 1: You know, it's pretty obvious, like what was going to happen in the in the movie.

661
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:19,793
Speaker 1: Right.

662
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:21,504
Speaker 1: It wasn't like, you know, a complicated plot.

663
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:25,690
Speaker 1: But, you know, it panned out well.

664
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,429
Speaker 1: Everything really came together.

665
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:42,230
Speaker 1: You know, there were, you know, a good, you know, progressive arc, but basically, I guess, short summary of it just to, you know, to wrap things up is, you know, the the main Gundam characters are on their on their ship, chilling, awaiting new orders.

666
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:42,871
Speaker 1: Right.

667
00:39:43,554 --> 00:39:51,009
Speaker 1: And they get ordered to go on this mission to clean up some remnant hostels from a previous battle that are on this island.

668
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:52,172
Speaker 1: Right.

669
00:39:52,753 --> 00:40:01,427
Speaker 1: And they go to the island and there's this dude there who's got a, you know, who's obviously a Xeon guy and he's got a fucking, you know, Zaku.

670
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's got a Zaku and he's hella dangerous.

671
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:06,155
Speaker 1: Right.

672
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:07,529
Speaker 1: And they can't really beat him.

673
00:40:08,515 --> 00:40:09,530
Speaker 1: And then there's bad weather.

674
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:20,790
Speaker 1: And so after they send they send people in to go find out what's going on with the island and then they you know, they think, you know, they're dead because they're lost and they had they can't they can't search the island right now with the bad weather.

675
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:21,632
Speaker 1: Right.

676
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:25,189
Speaker 0: Well, that's like the plot of, I don't know, a third of all Star Trek episodes.

677
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,810
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's an excuse to have them trapped there.

678
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,111
Speaker 1: Right.

679
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:37,249
Speaker 1: And it turns out, you know, the the the the doin guy, that super bad ass Zaku pilot, he's got all these kids on the island he's taking care of.

680
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:37,712
Speaker 1: Right.

681
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:40,910
Speaker 1: He's he's a good guy and he's probably he's up to something good.

682
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:43,870
Speaker 1: You know, he's abandoned the the Xeon people.

683
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:46,670
Speaker 1: He's just defending the island from war in general.

684
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:47,552
Speaker 1: Right.

685
00:40:49,398 --> 00:40:54,392
Speaker 1: And then, you know, shit happens and it turns out the secret shit on the island, of course.

686
00:40:54,573 --> 00:40:54,874
Speaker 1: Right.

687
00:40:54,934 --> 00:41:05,550
Speaker 1: And, you know, eventually Xeon comes back to the island and the good guys come back to the island and they fight and then everything is resolved somehow.

688
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:11,210
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess it had to be because it was originally a self-contained episode that wasn't even important enough to compile.

689
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,495
Speaker 1: It had to be.

690
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:14,410
Speaker 1: Otherwise, there wouldn't be episode 16.

691
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,089
Speaker 1: You know, episode 16 is coming next.

692
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:19,189
Speaker 1: Did you at least know that much?

693
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:19,610
Speaker 1: Right.

694
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:25,192
Speaker 1: It's really, you know, a story of the characters that are introduced for this episode.

695
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:25,433
Speaker 1: Right.

696
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:39,008
Speaker 1: Doan and the children and, you know, the Gundam characters are just sort of, you know, passing through to sort of reveal which is interesting because that is how like the Slayers movie slash OAVs were.

697
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,969
Speaker 0: That is how a lot of the One Piece movies are.

698
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,649
Speaker 1: It is a lot like a Slayers movie.

699
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:52,688
Speaker 0: Like the main characters don't have an arc, they're just there and interact with the new characters who have an arc and that are never seen again.

700
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,463
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

701
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:54,850
Speaker 1: Right.

702
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:56,436
Speaker 1: So it's one of those.

703
00:41:56,456 --> 00:41:58,930
Speaker 1: It's a. it's a pretty good one of those, actually.

704
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:07,690
Speaker 1: Like if you took and made the original Gundam series and made a movie like this for every episode, that would be a very positive, incredible thing.

705
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:08,072
Speaker 1: Right.

706
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,529
Speaker 1: It's like it might take forty nine years if they do one a year.

707
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:19,907
Speaker 1: It might take it might take ninety eight years if they do one every other year, but I'm glad they made this.

708
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:26,654
Speaker 1: It sort of puts the infamy thing to rest, you know, if you and if you're a Gundam fan, see it.

709
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:29,150
Speaker 1: And if not, you know, but yeah, they aired it.

710
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,390
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot to mention this.

711
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,949
Speaker 1: They aired it in the air.

712
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,190
Speaker 1: It.

713
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:38,671
Speaker 1: it was in US theaters two nights only one night sub the next night dub one showing of each.

714
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:39,233
Speaker 1: And that was it.

715
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:48,845
Speaker 1: So to see it now, you're going to have to either wait for it to be streamed or Blu-rayed or pirated or imported or something.

716
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:51,873
Speaker 1: Right.

717
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:52,897
Speaker 1: But I saw.

718
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:56,836
Speaker 1: I went to the movie theater and I saw it during the one night sub screening.

719
00:42:56,856 --> 00:42:58,009
Speaker 1: And that was, you know.

720
00:42:58,732 --> 00:42:59,608
Speaker 0: All right, not bad.

721
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:06,370
Speaker 0: So the thing I watch that I know Scott will never watch will never watch.

722
00:43:06,571 --> 00:43:07,195
Speaker 0: Yeah.

723
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:09,530
Speaker 0: So I'm on a big Star Trek kick again.

724
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,610
Speaker 0: I rewatch DS nine.

725
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,709
Speaker 0: And if you're a Star Trek fan, the Star Trek cup overflow recently.

726
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:21,950
Speaker 0: And other than the movies, because there's drama, all of the Star Trek TV shows are just on Paramount Plus.

727
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:26,851
Speaker 0: So I'm actually paying for that service because we were watching like all the Star Treks.

728
00:43:27,192 --> 00:43:36,050
Speaker 0: But there are actually two different independent Star Trek animated series that are currently airing simultaneously.

729
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:38,710
Speaker 0: That are set in different times in different places.

730
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:51,250
Speaker 0: So this now brings the total of animated Star Treks to three, if any of you remember the original animated series, which even I knew that existed, even though I never watched it, didn't have that many episodes.

731
00:43:52,072 --> 00:43:53,190
Speaker 0: In fact, it had two seasons.

732
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:59,009
Speaker 0: So there is like twenty two episodes total of that animated series, the original one.

733
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,650
Speaker 0: So lower decks I've talked about.

734
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:02,418
Speaker 0: It's fantastic.

735
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:03,347
Speaker 0: I love the shit out of it.

736
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:22,810
Speaker 0: Star Trek Prodigy is interesting because if I had to describe it one, if you did not know Star Trek existed, like say you've never heard of Star Trek, but you had heard of Star Wars and I showed you a random episode of, I don't know, Star Trek, the next generation, you would not think that this was Star Wars.

737
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,569
Speaker 0: You would know that it was something different.

738
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:32,067
Speaker 0: Just obviously it's so different in like how action is portrayed and how characters talk and what kinds of stories there are.

739
00:44:32,853 --> 00:44:35,150
Speaker 0: But if I and I would say that is true of almost all Star Treks.

740
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:45,250
Speaker 0: But if I showed you a random episode of Star Trek Prodigy and you would never heard of Star Trek, I think you would assume this is set in the Star Wars universe.

741
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:46,614
Speaker 1: Well, but there would.

742
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:51,150
Speaker 1: there were, first of all, even no matter how it's structured or the plot or the characters.

743
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:51,952
Speaker 1: Right.

744
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:55,090
Speaker 1: A, there would be some people wearing like, you know, Starfleet uniform.

745
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,030
Speaker 0: Ah, there really aren't in Star Trek Prodigy.

746
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,992
Speaker 0: All right.

747
00:44:59,214 --> 00:45:01,790
Speaker 0: There is one character wearing a Star Trek uniform.

748
00:45:02,672 --> 00:45:03,501
Speaker 1: Well, that would give it away.

749
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:04,270
Speaker 1: Just one is enough.

750
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:08,755
Speaker 0: But if you had never heard of Star Trek, that's just that's just there's that one human wearing the weird uniform.

751
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,432
Speaker 1: The other thing is that Star Wars, no matter which Star Wars it is.

752
00:45:12,733 --> 00:45:13,014
Speaker 1: Right.

753
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:21,550
Speaker 1: There are certain like, you know, Star Wars things that are always going to like appear like, you know, a ship that looks something like an X-wing.

754
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:22,253
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

755
00:45:22,274 --> 00:45:23,729
Speaker 0: There's there's stuff like that in this.

756
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:24,752
Speaker 1: Right.

757
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:30,010
Speaker 1: Or, you know, a guy wearing some armor that's reminiscent of a stormtrooper.

758
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:30,312
Speaker 0: Yeah.

759
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,398
Speaker 0: There is basically that.

760
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,410
Speaker 0: there is basically a Darth Sidious.

761
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,550
Speaker 0: There is basically a Darth Maul, like the bad guys.

762
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:41,768
Speaker 1: Aesthetically, like aesthetically, you would think that like, oh, is that is that?

763
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:42,672
Speaker 1: is that an evil?

764
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:46,954
Speaker 0: If you watch this, you look at one guy and think, whoa, is that like the Emperor's son?

765
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:49,645
Speaker 0: You see the other guy like, whoa, is that?

766
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:55,069
Speaker 1: so you're saying that they have pirated Star Wars aesthetics and into their show.

767
00:45:55,551 --> 00:46:05,809
Speaker 0: So it's more that it's telling the kind of story that Star Wars, like the expanded Star Wars universe would tell more so than what Star Trek typically does.

768
00:46:07,472 --> 00:46:08,258
Speaker 1: But why is it called?

769
00:46:08,278 --> 00:46:10,070
Speaker 1: Prodigy is the name of a ship like usual.

770
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:11,950
Speaker 0: So that's actually TBD.

771
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:13,345
Speaker 0: So only one is out.

772
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:14,552
Speaker 0: There's more coming.

773
00:46:15,114 --> 00:46:19,870
Speaker 0: But basically it the ship in this one is not called the prodigy.

774
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:22,169
Speaker 0: It's it's a whole other thing going on.

775
00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:38,809
Speaker 0: So to avoid getting into the details of Star Trek for the Scott audience, this is set after one of the other Star Trek's called Voyager, and it's way out in like so far away from the Federation that the Federation basically doesn't exist out there.

776
00:46:39,612 --> 00:46:44,189
Speaker 0: And a Star Trek Federation ship is basically crashed or something happened to it.

777
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:47,630
Speaker 0: So it's out alone, way out in the edge of the universe.

778
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:55,669
Speaker 0: A bunch of kids who are basically slaves on a planet that is run by an evil Star Wars looking emperor type dude.

779
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:59,550
Speaker 1: Well, that sounds like the first Star Trek series slaves on a planet.

780
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:04,330
Speaker 0: They basically find this ship and use it to escape from this planet.

781
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,230
Speaker 0: The ship happens to be a Federation ship.

782
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:11,210
Speaker 1: They basically seal a Star Trek, a full size one like that has a city inside.

783
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:15,910
Speaker 0: It is a full size Star Trek ship that is just a couple of kids.

784
00:47:16,373 --> 00:47:18,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, a couple of kids works.

785
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,069
Speaker 1: It crashed and it still works.

786
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,618
Speaker 0: Well, we don't know what deal like.

787
00:47:21,658 --> 00:47:24,550
Speaker 1: I'm trying to avoid the full of thousands upon thousands of corpses.

788
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:26,089
Speaker 0: And no, it's empty.

789
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:35,210
Speaker 0: In fact, the only thing on it when the kids get onto it is a hologram and holograms in the Star Trek universe or semi ascension like it's complicated.

790
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:36,945
Speaker 1: So it was guarding this.

791
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:38,806
Speaker 0: No, no, it was guarding it.

792
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,289
Speaker 0: They find it, salvaging it.

793
00:47:41,811 --> 00:47:48,529
Speaker 0: No, in fact, the evil guys vaguely knew it was there and we're looking for it, but the kids found it.

794
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:49,268
Speaker 0: It's enormous.

795
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, could you not find it?

796
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:52,970
Speaker 0: That is all revealed.

797
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,649
Speaker 0: That's part of the story of the show.

798
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:56,649
Speaker 1: This doesn't make any fucking sense.

799
00:47:57,171 --> 00:48:00,710
Speaker 1: OK, so the kids, even with my little Star Trek knowledge, it makes no sense.

800
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:01,194
Speaker 0: Yeah.

801
00:48:01,214 --> 00:48:01,949
Speaker 0: So it's kind of crazy.

802
00:48:02,131 --> 00:48:05,450
Speaker 0: Actually, the kids find the ship and the deal is the ship.

803
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:15,150
Speaker 0: The only thing on the ship is the hologram, which is a copy of a real starship captain from a previous Star Trek set way before this show happens, like Captain Jane.

804
00:48:15,313 --> 00:48:15,863
Speaker 1: OK, well, that's good.

805
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:16,751
Speaker 1: That's good.

806
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:23,769
Speaker 0: So the hologram sees these kids and is like, I guess you're the new cadets and the kids are like, boy, howdy.

807
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:24,572
Speaker 0: Yes.

808
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:27,230
Speaker 1: And the kids be like, we don't have to do it.

809
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,134
Speaker 1: I mean, they want to.

810
00:48:28,234 --> 00:48:32,194
Speaker 0: But if they basically want to steal the ship, so obviously they want to.

811
00:48:32,254 --> 00:48:34,110
Speaker 1: But they could just be like, you're just a hologram.

812
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,975
Speaker 1: You can't tell us what to do.

813
00:48:35,036 --> 00:48:41,350
Speaker 0: Well, the hologram is currently able to run the whole ship and oh, that's how the corpses got disposed of.

814
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,749
Speaker 0: OK, well, there are no corpses.

815
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,289
Speaker 0: We don't know the deal with the ship yet.

816
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:46,949
Speaker 0: So the kids basically just are on the ship.

817
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:50,370
Speaker 0: They act like, yes, there's a hologram alone.

818
00:48:50,551 --> 00:49:00,020
Speaker 0: Of course, we're cadets and the holograms like good because this ship is designed to train cadets on this whole sort of special mission and they don't understand and adventure.

819
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:00,750
Speaker 1: What a coincidence.

820
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:01,714
Speaker 1: That's probably a lie.

821
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:07,308
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a whole real Star Trek plot, but that does not really get revealed until the end of season one.

822
00:49:09,253 --> 00:49:22,130
Speaker 0: But if I had to describe what the show is actually about, not in a Star Trek context, these kids basically find the ship and go off on an adventure and there's a sinister undercurrent and the evil guys are chasing them.

823
00:49:22,453 --> 00:49:24,230
Speaker 0: There's almost no human characters.

824
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:30,214
Speaker 1: And it is just the evil guys who are who are enslaving them can chase them through space.

825
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:32,650
Speaker 1: It means they can fly in space.

826
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:33,033
Speaker 1: Yes.

827
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:36,849
Speaker 1: How come they weren't able to locate a giant ship on their own planet?

828
00:49:37,971 --> 00:49:40,110
Speaker 0: That's kind of revealed and complicated.

829
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,710
Speaker 1: Does it have a cloaking device?

830
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:47,015
Speaker 0: I'm not going to explain to you the deal with cloaking devices in Star Trek because there's a lot.

831
00:49:47,035 --> 00:49:48,430
Speaker 1: Pretty sure only bad guys have them.

832
00:49:49,371 --> 00:49:52,809
Speaker 0: That's actually low key kind of true for complicated reasons.

833
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:54,233
Speaker 1: That's right.

834
00:49:54,253 --> 00:49:54,697
Speaker 1: I know.

835
00:49:54,817 --> 00:49:56,410
Speaker 1: I know there's bare minimums.

836
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:56,953
Speaker 1: I'm a nerd.

837
00:49:57,134 --> 00:49:59,610
Speaker 1: Even though I don't like Star Trek and have watched almost none.

838
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:09,630
Speaker 0: So the deal is I know that to end the war in the old Star Trek, only the bad guys that had cloaking devices, the Federation could easily develop this technology.

839
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:18,790
Speaker 0: And to end those wars, the Federation basically signed a treaty where they agreed they would never research or use cloaking technology under any circumstances ever.

840
00:50:20,536 --> 00:50:21,290
Speaker 0: They're just like our ships.

841
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:22,075
Speaker 1: I didn't.

842
00:50:22,176 --> 00:50:23,689
Speaker 1: I didn't know that there was a reason for it.

843
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:36,590
Speaker 0: There is a canonical reason for it because it is a plot point in one of the Star Treks, Deep Space Nine, because the Romulans give give the Federation permission to use one ship with a cloaking device for complicated reasons.

844
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,972
Speaker 0: Anyway, I digress.

845
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:44,571
Speaker 0: So the show really is almost like a kid's introduction to Star Trek.

846
00:50:45,134 --> 00:50:54,010
Speaker 0: It's almost like imagine if there's a kid in the real world today who's like twelve, ten, maybe eight, and you want to introduce them to Star Trek.

847
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,742
Speaker 0: This show kind of almost walks a kid through.

848
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:01,210
Speaker 0: what's the deal with Star Trek, but is also a good kid's show.

849
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:05,090
Speaker 0: I would say this is absolutely a show aimed at kids for kids.

850
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,013
Speaker 0: Good for kids.

851
00:51:06,536 --> 00:51:08,044
Speaker 0: It's very Star Wars like.

852
00:51:08,185 --> 00:51:08,989
Speaker 0: it's super fun.

853
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:18,090
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's interesting that I just talked about Gundam, because at least the part about kids finding a powerful technology is a very Gundam thing.

854
00:51:18,231 --> 00:51:18,431
Speaker 1: Right.

855
00:51:18,472 --> 00:51:25,989
Speaker 1: Just instead of one kid finding one robot and becoming the best pilot of it, it's a group of kids finding a whole ship and becoming the crew.

856
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:26,571
Speaker 0: Yep.

857
00:51:27,013 --> 00:51:30,450
Speaker 0: And they escape with this ship and shenanigans in space ensue.

858
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:31,969
Speaker 0: And the bad guys are trying to chase them.

859
00:51:32,692 --> 00:51:34,570
Speaker 0: And I'm not going to spoil anything that happens.

860
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:47,469
Speaker 0: But for Star Trek nerds, it's interesting because until the last episode, you don't really know when this is set because it feels like it's set way after most of the Star Trek most people have ever watched.

861
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,210
Speaker 0: And it is set after a lot of Star Trek.

862
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:53,649
Speaker 0: But if you don't know anything about Star Trek, it's just a sci fi story.

863
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:57,269
Speaker 0: that's actually pretty compelling and pretty well done and good for kids.

864
00:51:58,451 --> 00:52:07,750
Speaker 1: I just want to say we can end the show, but, you know, the trope of kids find, acquire powerful thing, magic, technology, objects, whatever.

865
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:08,598
Speaker 0: It's a good genre.

866
00:52:08,618 --> 00:52:08,780
Speaker 0: Right.

867
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:10,860
Speaker 1: It's like that's a good genre.

868
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,969
Speaker 1: It's been done a million times.

869
00:52:12,251 --> 00:52:12,491
Speaker 1: Right.

870
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:20,784
Speaker 1: We've also occasionally seen the adjacent one of two different groups of kids or two kids.

871
00:52:21,128 --> 00:52:21,310
Speaker 1: Right.

872
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:26,290
Speaker 1: Both acquire some kind of MacGuffin technology magic at the same time.

873
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,790
Speaker 1: And one good one's good and one's evil.

874
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:28,478
Speaker 1: We've seen that.

875
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:28,985
Speaker 0: Yeah.

876
00:52:29,026 --> 00:52:29,229
Speaker 0: Right.

877
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:37,096
Speaker 1: What I haven't seen is anyone go over to write three or four, not kids in the same group.

878
00:52:37,177 --> 00:52:37,747
Speaker 1: I've seen that.

879
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:37,930
Speaker 1: Right.

880
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:46,809
Speaker 1: But I'm saying like three or four or more different groups of kids all find powerful things at the same time.

881
00:52:47,232 --> 00:52:48,510
Speaker 0: Isn't that just Pokemon?

882
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:53,970
Speaker 1: No, because the Pokemon is about the one kid who's the champ.

883
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,429
Speaker 1: Everyone else is just normal Pokemon.

884
00:52:57,253 --> 00:52:59,080
Speaker 1: It's not like you ever see.

885
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:08,949
Speaker 1: in Pokemon, you never have a situation where like five different ashes are out there all catching different legendaries who all show up at the Pokemon, you know, league at the same time.

886
00:53:09,415 --> 00:53:09,598
Speaker 1: Right.

887
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:10,269
Speaker 1: You don't see that.

888
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,510
Speaker 1: It's one person who's catching the legendaries.

889
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,257
Speaker 0: You know what's funny?

890
00:53:13,317 --> 00:53:14,750
Speaker 0: Even the isekai shows tend to have this.

891
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,029
Speaker 0: You often like for Shiggy Yugi did this even go all the way back.

892
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:22,150
Speaker 0: Multiple people get transported to the magical world or the sci-fi world.

893
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:22,956
Speaker 0: But that's together.

894
00:53:23,017 --> 00:53:24,310
Speaker 1: That's like, you know, El Hazzard.

895
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,150
Speaker 1: They go together.

896
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:26,194
Speaker 0: But they go together.

897
00:53:26,234 --> 00:53:31,850
Speaker 0: But you almost always some of them end up like on the evil side and some of them end up on the good side.

898
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:32,395
Speaker 1: El Hazzard.

899
00:53:32,456 --> 00:53:32,659
Speaker 1: Right.

900
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:33,429
Speaker 1: He's got the bug room.

901
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:33,855
Speaker 1: One guy.

902
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:34,730
Speaker 1: It's two groups.

903
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:34,952
Speaker 1: Right.

904
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:36,049
Speaker 1: The good ones and the bad ones.

905
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:37,828
Speaker 1: But there wasn't a three a three way.

906
00:53:38,192 --> 00:53:38,638
Speaker 1: Yeah.

907
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,489
Speaker 1: Or a four way.

908
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,536
Speaker 0: I feel like the more complex.

909
00:53:41,736 --> 00:53:45,252
Speaker 1: interesting is occasionally you see a little less black and white.

910
00:53:45,373 --> 00:53:46,970
Speaker 0: I think you occasionally see the three way.

911
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,143
Speaker 0: But the three was usually like.

912
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:49,910
Speaker 1: Give me an example of the three way.

913
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,079
Speaker 0: So you see some of those less.

914
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:54,670
Speaker 1: one example, one show, one book, one movie, one.

915
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:56,087
Speaker 0: So the trope would be it.

916
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:57,577
Speaker 0: I think it boils down to.

917
00:53:57,657 --> 00:54:00,750
Speaker 0: you might have an individual character, but I think it was a good specific example.

918
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:06,753
Speaker 0: That isn't just like a random El Hazzard character where you've got the typical two factions.

919
00:54:07,215 --> 00:54:10,590
Speaker 0: But then there's one character who's like, fuck all this.

920
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:11,540
Speaker 0: I don't care about any of this.

921
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,470
Speaker 0: I'm just doing my own thing.

922
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:16,030
Speaker 0: And they're a side character, but they never are involved in the real plot.

923
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm talking main main characters, right?

924
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:20,855
Speaker 0: Yeah.

925
00:54:21,038 --> 00:54:21,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

926
00:54:22,451 --> 00:54:39,490
Speaker 0: But I would say if you want to introduce kids to Star Trek, Prodigy is like the gateway show to get a kid interested in Star Trek at all, because it kind of over the course of the show teaches you what's the deal with Star Trek and what's the deal with the Federation in a pretty interesting way.

927
00:54:39,971 --> 00:54:40,835
Speaker 0: But it is a kid's show.

928
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:47,189
Speaker 0: It's not like the grim, dark nonsense of Picard or the typical Star Trek fare of what most Star Treks are like.

929
00:54:53,481 --> 00:54:55,640
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

Speaker 0: The next station is Finch West, Finch West Station.

941
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:54,380
Speaker 0: And many, many people whose names I will not say because they have correctly chosen to give us like a dollar.

942
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,080
Speaker 0: So anyway, yeah, we're still back.

943
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:57,950
Speaker 0: I got nothing new.

944
00:55:58,031 --> 00:55:58,540
Speaker 0: I'm really hungry.

945
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:01,640
Speaker 0: So I'm just going to end this on a song that you may recognize.

946
00:56:37,701 --> 00:56:39,919
Speaker 1: You were first to the match called the Reindeer Girls.

947
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:44,550
Speaker 0: Oh, something.
