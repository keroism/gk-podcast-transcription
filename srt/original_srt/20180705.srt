1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,270
Speaker 1: It's Thursday July 5th 2018.

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,907
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:19,260
Speaker 1: bike shares and car shares and I guess scooter shares cuz that's the thing.

4
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:22,378
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:27,651
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't do a show on Tuesday cuz it rained.

6
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:30,220
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and I guess we don't do shows in the right.

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:41,209
Speaker 0: Well, I was home all day and then I was gonna come down here But it's like it was inconvenient to come down here with any method other than bicycle and which is true I'm not I don't blame you for that and then is raining and it's like.

8
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,353
Speaker 0: well suppose.

9
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:51,868
Speaker 1: I couldn't help but think of that Seinfeld where Jerry's trying to find out why we won't deliver with the mail cuz it's raining and it's like it was raining Neither rain nor since the first one.

10
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,580
Speaker 0: but on the geek nights is not the US Postal Service.

11
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:57,878
Speaker 0: We never made a claim them.

12
00:00:58,946 --> 00:00:59,878
Speaker 0: Whatever will cause it.

13
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:06,440
Speaker 1: Nor pub G update will keep us from making our appointed podcast.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,408
Speaker 1: But so we didn't do show on Tuesday cuz of that.

15
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:15,611
Speaker 1: but rest assured the next Tuesday show we're talking about pub G We're gonna go because we're supposed

16
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:21,901
Speaker 0: to do this episode about the Odyssey Which I said I was gonna read while I was on the beach and I read zero words of it while I was on the Beach

17
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:25,520
Speaker 1: and while I would like to say come on Scott we were supposed to do the show

18
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:27,596
Speaker 0: Zero words of it on the beach.

19
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:29,966
Speaker 1: I read No, I read one or two words.

20
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:38,280
Speaker 1: cuz I looked at it on my phone and then I decided that was not the time Nor was it the place to read the Odyssey and instead I closed my eyes and took a nap in the Sun.

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,736
Speaker 1: The fireworks though yesterday from our rooftop despite all these buildings built in my neighborhood.

22
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:45,840
Speaker 0: It's really just one building.

23
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they built all these other buildings.

24
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:51,920
Speaker 0: None of them are in the way of the fireworks except the one that's been in the way for like two or three years.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:59,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's I think there's five Macy's barges or four Macy's for we can see the fireworks from all but one of them.

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,705
Speaker 0: Barges one two and four.

27
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:02,587
Speaker 0: the building blocks.

28
00:02:02,627 --> 00:02:05,396
Speaker 1: barge number three, but it blocks it like a hundred percent.

29
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:06,078
Speaker 1: It's almost funny.

30
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:06,880
Speaker 1: It's like it's censored.

31
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:07,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

32
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:08,310
Speaker 0: it's pretty much.

33
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,820
Speaker 0: It's like this is black bar over the.

34
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:14,620
Speaker 1: It's a good time though cuz I went running during the day.

35
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,840
Speaker 1: He's a holiday don't have to work and I forgot that the 4th of July.

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:24,000
Speaker 1: The neighborhood we live in or that I live in especially becomes kind of a problem whenever there's a fireworks.

37
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:27,000
Speaker 0: Well, remember when they used to be on the Hudson River then it wasn't a problem.

38
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:29,259
Speaker 0: I think it's time to go back to the Hudson.

39
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:35,360
Speaker 0: We had East River we when it was Hudson River so many years in a row and I was like, what the fuck?

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,223
Speaker 0: Why you know East River?

41
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:38,935
Speaker 0: then they did East River so many years in a row.

42
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:49,359
Speaker 1: It's like, all right We can go back now, but well, I guess Jersey still but The East River if you put it where they put them the maximum number of humans can see them.

43
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:51,125
Speaker 1: They got three boroughs.

44
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:56,380
Speaker 0: put them where they put them right now the maximum number of New York humans can see them.

45
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:59,279
Speaker 1: I think that's exactly what I said.

46
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:01,065
Speaker 0: No, you said maximum number of humans.

47
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:05,556
Speaker 0: and on the other side, it would just be Jersey human seeing them.

48
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:06,880
Speaker 1: I'd stand by my point.

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:19,920
Speaker 1: But basically Everyone from the suburbs and everyone from like far out parts of New York Come to our neighborhood to try to watch the fireworks and people who live in New York know the deal.

50
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:25,340
Speaker 1: So like you show up and cops like check your bag and they don't let you carry alcohol.

51
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:26,265
Speaker 0: What's that?

52
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:27,974
Speaker 0: a bort Connecticut license plate?

53
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:29,100
Speaker 0: turn your ass around.

54
00:03:29,181 --> 00:03:30,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, you ain't parking here.

55
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:39,019
Speaker 1: But the funny thing is the suburban people because they just I guess there's must be like some set of 10,000 people every year Who cleverly think wait?

56
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:45,779
Speaker 1: Why don't I just drive to New York and go where the fireworks are gonna be and I'll see him real good and real close.

57
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:51,919
Speaker 0: Get here at the crack-ass of dawn and stand in a place where they won't let you leave and you can't pee or poop unless You peep in your pants.

58
00:03:52,101 --> 00:04:00,837
Speaker 1: Ah, but more importantly you find out that you're not allowed to park fucking anywhere in our neighborhood If there's fireworks way out and take a train in just like everyone else.

59
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:04,217
Speaker 0: Yep Actually, if you took Metro north and then a subway you probably right.

60
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:07,467
Speaker 0: Yeah You'd be as alright as any other New Yorker.

61
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:11,520
Speaker 0: Li has a stop right there - yeah, I'm sure it's running.

62
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,789
Speaker 1: I think that one only runs on weekdays.

63
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:14,913
Speaker 1: that aren't holidays though.

64
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:15,495
Speaker 1: Hmm.

65
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:16,760
Speaker 1: It's a small weird stop.

66
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,747
Speaker 1: It's a connection to the seven like.

67
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:22,280
Speaker 1: I want to use it to get on the train to go places.

68
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:23,599
Speaker 0: Where are you gonna go in Long Island?

69
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:25,386
Speaker 1: Exactly.

70
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:26,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could use it.

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:34,211
Speaker 0: There's there's a there is a LIR our way to get to the LIR for the first time in my life Because we biked to the Jones Beach and then I had to get home.

72
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:40,174
Speaker 1: I used it to visit Emily from Ronkonkoma.

73
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,990
Speaker 0: Why were you in Ronkonkoma?

74
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,620
Speaker 1: because I drove Lisa to be with her family.

75
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:48,360
Speaker 1: Okay, and then I took the train into the city for a few days anyway left your car in Ronkonkoma.

76
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:50,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay not taking it in the city.

77
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:59,623
Speaker 1: But the funniest thing are all these people from out of the city Drive in and they don't know what to do when the cops are like, yeah, every road over here is closed pedestrians only Mm-hmm.

78
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:03,696
Speaker 1: Oh and you can't park anywhere because no parking during the holiday and I don't know what to do.

79
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:15,534
Speaker 1: and I witnessed easily half a dozen separate cars of chubby middle-aged suburban white folk Screaming at cops and demanding something to happen.

80
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:24,288
Speaker 1: while the cops stand there There's a particular New York pose a cop has where they either cross their arms or they have like one hand on their hip and they're Not rolling their eyes.

81
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:28,840
Speaker 1: They're not actually rolling their eyes Oh, but the eyes of the soul are rolled.

82
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,684
Speaker 0: Well, I think it is.

83
00:05:29,724 --> 00:05:33,120
Speaker 0: if you're a New Yorker, it's sort of like obey and you know that would they live, right?

84
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, I look at them.

85
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:38,431
Speaker 0: I see their eyes going But when a suburb person looks at him, they're not moving.

86
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:40,600
Speaker 1: Yep, basically what the cops body language?

87
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:53,832
Speaker 1: I can translate the New York cop body language because that cop body language is I'm waiting until you stop saying words and then I'm gonna say the exact thing I just said to you again and we will repeat this all fucking day.

88
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:58,612
Speaker 0: cuz I'm getting paid overtime and I'd literally do not care And I may put you in jail if I feel like it.

89
00:05:58,693 --> 00:05:59,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not too lazy.

90
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:05,660
Speaker 1: But then they get clever and they think what if I just drive onto Roosevelt Island?

91
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:06,767
Speaker 1: That's right.

92
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:17,480
Speaker 0: when I biked home There were many cops there Barrick and they I saw actually a bunch of cars coming off the island.

93
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:21,893
Speaker 0: So I think they may have let people on but I don't know who but it wasn't.

94
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,360
Speaker 0: it wasn't like, you know a flood, right?

95
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,895
Speaker 0: It's like they let some number of people over.

96
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:34,872
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I know what they do because at that moment just after fireworks there was Cars coming and much more than there aren't any other time I've ever gone past.

97
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:39,979
Speaker 1: so last year I discovered the Roosevelt Island thing and I asked the cop who was standing there because it was like it's 8 a.m.

98
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:47,457
Speaker 1: I was out for a run and he basically said we don't let anyone on the island in a car unless they can prove they live there.

99
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:56,712
Speaker 1: or They give the address like an address and a phone number someone on the island and then unless there's a line We'll call that number right then and see if they're lying.

100
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:58,479
Speaker 1: Mmm, and otherwise, they don't let him on.

101
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:01,648
Speaker 1: So, yeah 4th of July the fireworks were.

102
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:07,859
Speaker 0: you give them my phone number and name and then I'll pick out the phone and say Yes, I live on Roosevelt Island.

103
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:11,969
Speaker 0: Yes, that is my friend delay industries.

104
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:13,473
Speaker 0: That is my friend.

105
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:14,095
Speaker 0: Yes.

106
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:15,820
Speaker 0: My address is blah blah blah.

107
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,763
Speaker 0: Thailand.

108
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:19,754
Speaker 1: I think I feel like New York cops.

109
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:26,516
Speaker 1: if you have enough of a hustle They let you get away with it because the vast majority of people have zero hustle.

110
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:28,606
Speaker 1: if they had hustle They'd be living here.

111
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:32,260
Speaker 0: I Think I don't think it's that they would be living here.

112
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:39,260
Speaker 0: I think it's that you you know, there are people with respect game There are people with hustle who don't live here, but there are zero people who live here without us.

113
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,060
Speaker 1: That is true with the possible exception of people who inherited their wealth.

114
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:45,839
Speaker 0: Well, no, I guess if they inherited their wealth they live here.

115
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:54,752
Speaker 0: They either get some hustle or they lose all that wealth to guys giving out free CD Every day.

116
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:55,882
Speaker 0: I'm hustling Every day.

117
00:07:56,886 --> 00:08:03,688
Speaker 1: so in the news, which is if you haven't seen this story, it's tragic Fascinating said there's a lot going on here.

118
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,960
Speaker 1: But in case you're unaware, I guess you can introduce is your news, right?

119
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,230
Speaker 0: Okay, so in Thailand, there's this what's a soccer team, right?

120
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:15,245
Speaker 0: I think it's yes football team a football team sure Soccer team and their coach.

121
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:20,888
Speaker 0: they went, you know on a little field trip into this cave system And it's like a touristy cave system.

122
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:23,620
Speaker 0: You can go explore which is totally mammoth cave in the u.s.

123
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, I totally want to go to an awesome cave like that.

124
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:29,099
Speaker 0: But they ran into a little problem and let me you know.

125
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:33,159
Speaker 0: Let me explain this problem by telling you a story when me and rim were in Australia.

126
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:37,239
Speaker 0: we'll walk it around this island, which is a beach island, but it wasn't in season.

127
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:42,659
Speaker 0: and We get to we see all these signs that are like can't go here between these hours.

128
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:51,800
Speaker 0: And basically what happened is during those hours the tide came in and it was impassable Because the water came all the way up covered the whole beach and covered even more of the land.

129
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:59,426
Speaker 0: So you couldn't walk that way unless you walk through the very thick brush of deadliness And probably poison spiders.

130
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:11,087
Speaker 0: you had to wait for tide to be low and go out so then you can walk along the beach Right, so they went into this cave system and the tide didn't come in but the monsoons did.

131
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:15,440
Speaker 0: monsoon came in and the rainy season came in while they were deep in the cave and It.

132
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:21,360
Speaker 0: basically they can't get out of the cave because it flooded and it won't unplug for months.

133
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,545
Speaker 1: Now no one was like.

134
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:26,537
Speaker 1: people weren't sure if they were alive like what the deal was.

135
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:27,380
Speaker 0: They were just missing.

136
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,120
Speaker 0: They were like, oh, but they knew they went in the cave.

137
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,426
Speaker 0: They just didn't know.

138
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:33,658
Speaker 0: and it was like well, they went in the cave didn't come back.

139
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:38,496
Speaker 1: Oh shit Yep, so basically the government sent a bunch of military cave divers.

140
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:39,901
Speaker 1: We'll get back to cave diving Right.

141
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,632
Speaker 0: It's like this is like 12 or 13 people, right?

142
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could send a big old search party.

143
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,168
Speaker 0: It's worth spending.

144
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:46,260
Speaker 0: It's not like one missing person.

145
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, the u.s.

146
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:54,771
Speaker 1: Sent 30 experts including 17 members of the Air Force Australian Australia, Japan, China, Myanmar, Laos, all sent people.

147
00:09:54,791 --> 00:10:03,120
Speaker 0: Because all these expert people, you know who are experts at diving and such They don't really have anything better to do on the whole earth right now and they're experts at this.

148
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:06,638
Speaker 1: So and if they succeed they're gonna save a whole bunch of kids lives, right?

149
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:22,699
Speaker 0: So basically the Thai Navy SEALs from what I heard Went in and they found them in this tiny little area of the cave way fucking deep completely trapped by water and It's almost impossible to get them out now.

150
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:32,026
Speaker 1: Part of the reason why the story is interesting is that the divers are there like bringing them food and all the armchair Internet people everywhere.

151
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:36,040
Speaker 1: There's comments everywhere people talk about it always seem to ask the exact same questions.

152
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:41,578
Speaker 1: Well, if you die if people dived in why don't they just put like scuba gear on these kids faces and dive them out?

153
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,985
Speaker 0: or these People don't know anything about scuba diving.

154
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:44,286
Speaker 0: Yep.

155
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:48,900
Speaker 1: So scuba diving is actually a super technical pretty dangerous thing to do.

156
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,108
Speaker 0: That's why I will never do it.

157
00:10:50,511 --> 00:11:06,040
Speaker 0: cave diving is Insanely more deadly than scuba dive Like skydiving would be like scuba diving right and Wing-suiting yeah wing-suiting with no parachute.

158
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,146
Speaker 0: It's like cave diving like.

159
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:12,097
Speaker 1: it's weird that I know a lot about cave diving because of one specific thing.

160
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:24,040
Speaker 1: FARC the web One of my favorite internet community other than the front row crew farm community Is obsessed with cave diving because there's a lot of really crazy stories of cave diver.

161
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,206
Speaker 0: thing You do more dangerous.

162
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:31,679
Speaker 0: the cave diving would be to do cave dive welding Dive into a cave and weld something down there.

163
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,896
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I guess someone dived into this cave to wet to stick this fancy metal sign into the wall.

164
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:44,452
Speaker 0: I Doubt they welded it down there though I'm pretty sure they didn't dive in the cave to do that because the probably wasn't flooded at them.

165
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,980
Speaker 1: Oh, no this this image is underwater.

166
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:50,820
Speaker 0: Yeah It's underwater now, but no it's always underwater.

167
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:52,244
Speaker 0: Okay, it's all.

168
00:11:52,545 --> 00:12:01,954
Speaker 1: this image is a famous sign from a site that kills a lot of cave divers and the sign basically says It's just really good sign with this skeleton, and it's just like prevent your death.

169
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:03,680
Speaker 1: go no farther.

170
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:10,837
Speaker 1: And then it's just like there's nothing beyond this sign worth dying for Mmm, which is true because if you go back there, it's just rocks and water.

171
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:20,579
Speaker 1: yep And dead people yes Like a lot of the famous cave divers who have done skeletons in a with scuba tanks in a praying position yep like.

172
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:34,512
Speaker 1: But so a lot of famous cave divers have died trying to find and bring out the bodies of Their friends who were also cave divers who died.

173
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:36,040
Speaker 0: this is how you know something is dangerous.

174
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:37,163
Speaker 0: Right is when.

175
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:43,119
Speaker 0: that's why I saw about skiing being dangerous because people who are pros Olympic skiers will severely injure themselves.

176
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,340
Speaker 0: skiing Right that tells you it's dangerous.

177
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:53,126
Speaker 0: So if you if professionals at a thing hurt themselves doing a thing that is not something that a non-professional Should even go anywhere near.

178
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:56,380
Speaker 0: so it's like if the fire eater burns his mouth on a torch.

179
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,659
Speaker 0: I should not try to become a fire eater.

180
00:12:59,322 --> 00:13:04,960
Speaker 1: So the reason why they can't just scuba dive these boys out is that it would probably kill every one of them.

181
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:08,839
Speaker 1: This is cave diving is such a difficult and technical thing.

182
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,357
Speaker 0: They tried pumping the water out, but the water is coming in too fast so that doesn't work.

183
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,026
Speaker 0: yep They tried.

184
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:22,000
Speaker 0: they want thinking about drilling a hole in there But the area that they're in is so tiny that drilling in there might just collapse the whole thing and kill them all too.

185
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,769
Speaker 1: And there's a basically a mountain on top of them.

186
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,454
Speaker 1: like there's no good way to drill.

187
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:28,220
Speaker 0: drilling in would be super super hard.

188
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,927
Speaker 0: They're looking to see if there's a natural opening because they found a natural opening But it goes into a different area.

189
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:47,340
Speaker 0: that wouldn't help you unless you also scuba dived yep, so So they're bringing the kids supplies right now And they're debating they're trying to train the miracle that none of the professional diving people have you know messed themselves up while bringing the supplies.

190
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, they I've read it probably like a doctor in there and stuff.

191
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:57,500
Speaker 1: I've read a couple of statements that the even these experts said this is an extremely difficult and technical cave dive.

192
00:13:57,621 --> 00:14:00,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like when they go in there's times where they basically can't see anything.

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:21,508
Speaker 0: They don't know which way is up which way is down or anything and they have to keep swimming Underwater with the scuba tank attached to you yep And make it through somewhere and some of the spaces they have to go through like I've you know I've gone in like Archaeological digs with is like certain parts you have to crawl through and it like the place you're crawling through is literally the size Of a tiny human body and you like you.

194
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,720
Speaker 0: basically it's one person at a time in a straight line going through there.

195
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they're scuba swimming diving through such a space that is narrow enough for just one person

196
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:32,467
Speaker 1: Yep, and things will happen like which

197
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:37,571
Speaker 0: is fine when there was no water in there cuz the kids probably crawled through and it was Way fun, but once it was filled with water.

198
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:48,340
Speaker 1: There's no way through there Yep, and it's not just a danger to the kids like you might say well if the floodwaters start rising Maybe you got to go for it There's a good chance that they try to bring those kids out.

199
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:51,000
Speaker 1: It'll kill some number of the professional divers.

200
00:14:51,361 --> 00:15:00,272
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the way cave diving accidents tend to work is if one of your people has a problem Pretty much, they're just dead, but if they're too close to you.

201
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,542
Speaker 1: They'll probably drag you down with them Mm-hmm.

202
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:06,040
Speaker 0: You can't just do something like attach a rope to the kids and pull them through either.

203
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:12,771
Speaker 1: They're gonna have to learn cave diving and scuba diving Mm-hmm pretty quickly in dark.

204
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:16,725
Speaker 0: assuming all these kids even know how to swim You don't even know if they know how to swim.

205
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:21,266
Speaker 1: granted at least most of the swimming they would need There's not that much swimming.

206
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:22,111
Speaker 1: They need to do.

207
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:30,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they'd have to learn Requisite for diving though, they'd have to learn things like intermediate swimming like how to use The foot flappers.

208
00:15:30,926 --> 00:15:31,669
Speaker 1: I'm not I don't die.

209
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:33,335
Speaker 1: I don't know any of that stuff.

210
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:34,600
Speaker 1: I avoided scuba diving.

211
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,431
Speaker 0: I actually did come up with one idea.

212
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:37,598
Speaker 0: That's not crazy, right?

213
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:42,275
Speaker 0: So they See is my cross eyes not rolling.

214
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:44,645
Speaker 0: All right, so where's what you do?

215
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:49,593
Speaker 0: you make a Tunnel out of like a plastic tube water tight.

216
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:54,976
Speaker 0: someone posted that exact suggestion Pump the water out of the tunnel and then they can crawl through the tunnel.

217
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:55,840
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, I read that exact.

218
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,266
Speaker 1: So here's here's the separate question for you.

219
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:02,297
Speaker 1: Let's say someone is in like a 10-foot deep pool like not a super deep pool.

220
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:06,779
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and Somehow their foot gets stuck on the bottom of the pool.

221
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,639
Speaker 1: Okay, could you just take a tube down and stick it in their mouth so they could breathe through it?

222
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:16,079
Speaker 0: No, cuz it just spit all the water out.

223
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:18,854
Speaker 1: So let's say then you give you pump all the water out of that tube.

224
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:21,150
Speaker 1: the tube the tube Just pulled down.

225
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:22,420
Speaker 1: no water in it.

226
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,431
Speaker 1: It has a little cap that's edible.

227
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,592
Speaker 1: the kid puts it in his mouth Bites the cap off and now it's just a clean path to air.

228
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:30,100
Speaker 1: could would that help the kid?

229
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,602
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so.

230
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:32,788
Speaker 1: No, it actually wouldn't.

231
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:33,250
Speaker 0: why not?

232
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:43,943
Speaker 1: because the water pressure Difference and the tube length combined would make it very difficult for the kid to draw enough air into as long as to not just Here's the thing.

233
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:47,840
Speaker 0: I'm saying is that you're thinking that the the other end of the tube is in the water.

234
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,916
Speaker 0: I'm like, no, no the kid where the place the kids are in now has air.

235
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:52,940
Speaker 0: they're in an air place.

236
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:54,388
Speaker 1: How many kilometers deep?

237
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:56,580
Speaker 1: do you think they are very many?

238
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,160
Speaker 1: How are you going to make a tube long enough to get through any of these sections?

239
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,748
Speaker 0: It's crazier than drilling the hole.

240
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,520
Speaker 0: I mean, it's less crazy than drilling the hole.

241
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:06,560
Speaker 0: I think it's more less crazy than making him scuba dive.

242
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,900
Speaker 1: Also, it would have to be rigid and unable to be penetrated by a crawling kid.

243
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,709
Speaker 1: Times 13 plus a bunch of adults.

244
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,151
Speaker 1: Yes.

245
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:15,337
Speaker 1: It's not.

246
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:16,040
Speaker 1: it's impossible.

247
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:17,729
Speaker 1: There's no material.

248
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,579
Speaker 1: science would not allow this to work.

249
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,339
Speaker 0: You could you could do a piece by piece to just got to attach them one at a time carefully.

250
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,117
Speaker 1: No, that wouldn't work.

251
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:26,099
Speaker 0: There's no way.

252
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:34,407
Speaker 0: One and when you one end of it is where the kids are out in the air The other end is on the air the other side and then you can pump all the water in And then you can start crawling through.

253
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,740
Speaker 1: why not just pump the water out of the cave?

254
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,115
Speaker 0: It's the same because water is coming into the cave.

255
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:39,920
Speaker 0: That's why you need the tunnel.

256
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think you could build that tunnel.

257
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,857
Speaker 1: I think it would take months to build that tunnel.

258
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:48,419
Speaker 0: It would be hard Yeah, I mean, but that's it's gonna be hard no matter what the options are.

259
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:51,360
Speaker 1: Also, I don't think you could build that tunnel with the constant flooding.

260
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,000
Speaker 0: It wouldn't because you don't pump it until the end once it's complete.

261
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:55,923
Speaker 1: So how are you gonna?

262
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:58,652
Speaker 1: so Scott some of those passages are really narrow.

263
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:00,919
Speaker 1: How is someone going to install the tunnel?

264
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:04,198
Speaker 1: Carefully, nah ain't gonna work.

265
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:10,106
Speaker 1: So in some other news, this is a totally sort of fun aside thing And it's I didn't.

266
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:13,160
Speaker 1: this isn't rigorously researched or anything but inflatable tunnel.

267
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:15,488
Speaker 0: It starts as a string and then you inflate it.

268
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:17,998
Speaker 1: how much pressure do you think you need to inflate it?

269
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:20,184
Speaker 0: enough a Lot, but you know.

270
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,178
Speaker 1: and how thick does it need to be so that it doesn't get punctured?

271
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,923
Speaker 0: Listen, we got to invent it.

272
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:28,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we might just invent like a teleporter or something first.

273
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:31,720
Speaker 0: I don't think it teleporters a little harder or a brain scanner.

274
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,359
Speaker 1: We just scan the kids brains and then leave them there.

275
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,020
Speaker 1: It's even harder print new copies of the kids with all their memories up to that point and just tell them they survived.

276
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,339
Speaker 0: I just nuke them out and then we can drill a hole.

277
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:46,753
Speaker 1: Feel like that might make a collapse Maybe on the kids.

278
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:49,866
Speaker 1: maybe so in some other sort of side news.

279
00:18:49,906 --> 00:19:06,219
Speaker 1: if you're not aware of the dada movement of art a big part of it is that It came out of the sort of like artistic reaction to the horrors of World War one itself a product of the logic and reason of the middle-class capitalist society that birthed it.

280
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:10,495
Speaker 1: and I don't want to get into like the history of dada or anything in detail.

281
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,907
Speaker 1: here seems like you do though I do but I don't want.

282
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:15,700
Speaker 1: I. I want to but that's not what this show is about.

283
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:23,172
Speaker 1: And also if we go for more than say five minutes I run out of knowledge and I'm in over my head and I will drown.

284
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:25,460
Speaker 0: and the Internet is someone who knows about art history.

285
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:29,200
Speaker 0: Come down on rim who is over his head and is drowning in a tunnel with no.

286
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,520
Speaker 1: So this is a tweet that has a nice thread behind it where basically there's some article that was like why is millennial?

287
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,513
Speaker 1: Culture and humor so surreal and dark and weird and meaningless.

288
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:41,300
Speaker 1: and I'm just gonna read this tweet.

289
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:48,639
Speaker 1: This is called dada and it first emerged in the wake of the First World War out of the belief that a society that could Create such a horror had no intrinsic value.

290
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:52,119
Speaker 1: Replace First World War with modern capitalism and there you go.

291
00:19:52,641 --> 00:20:20,619
Speaker 1: so this is an argument and the thread gets into a lot more details and I actually Googled around a little bit and this is not a new revelation and this is being discussed in art circles Currently by people way smarter than us about how the weird millennial culture and internet bullshit that I like For example, all that nonsense is very reminiscent of the dada movement and has many parallels in terms of the things happening in society that might be driving it.

292
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:26,060
Speaker 1: so this is my defense of potato conditions.

293
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:33,459
Speaker 0: This is so rim because it is a post-hoc explanation, which is the key aspect of rim ism.

294
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:43,347
Speaker 0: Well, most explanations are post-hoc because the world quantum theory in the world in and of itself is a post-hoc explanation of post-hoc Explanations, which is metarim ism.

295
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:54,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you don't even have any free will you're just rationalizing things You already did so your entire consciousness is nothing but a post-hoc rationalization of things you did probably randomly and that is not just one that you see.

296
00:20:55,701 --> 00:21:01,020
Speaker 0: Post-hoc explanations are a core tenet of rim ism, but that is the core tenet of written.

297
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:14,500
Speaker 1: But the parallels are very interesting because honestly the current state of late-stage Western capitalism is Pretty fucked and we're really starting to see that it's gonna destroy society.

298
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,331
Speaker 0: We have an ism without a late-stage.

299
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:17,680
Speaker 0: It just just keeps working.

300
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,366
Speaker 1: I mean so far late-stage.

301
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:22,558
Speaker 1: democratic socialism is people mostly have health care.

302
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:25,038
Speaker 1: Like so far so good.

303
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:35,526
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the day, so this was making the rounds.

304
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:50,494
Speaker 1: if you didn't see it it is Utterly delightful, but basically in I think Edmonton this couple a man and a woman try to rob a convenience store and it goes Hilariously poorly.

305
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:52,501
Speaker 0: it goes way bad like it.

306
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:55,210
Speaker 0: look this the thing is the cops are doing a bad job, too.

307
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:57,726
Speaker 1: Well, cuz there's only one cop and he's trying to.

308
00:21:58,028 --> 00:21:58,350
Speaker 1: he's based.

309
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:05,897
Speaker 1: This cop is really trying to deal with the situation without inflicting undue harm or killing anyone But he's also trying to arrest these people forcibly.

310
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:06,960
Speaker 0: Yeah.

311
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:10,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like this cop honestly should have used more force earlier.

312
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:13,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, just whack him on the head with a stick.

313
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:15,801
Speaker 0: But that's the problem is in the UK.

314
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:16,605
Speaker 0: the cops got sticks.

315
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,590
Speaker 0: They just whack you on the head.

316
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:21,245
Speaker 0: Yes a taser - it looks like I thought as a gun and I think I thought he's.

317
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:22,370
Speaker 0: I thought the reason he wasn't shooting It.

318
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:24,243
Speaker 0: cuz he's gonna kill somebody if it was a taser.

319
00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:25,270
Speaker 0: You should have shot it right away.

320
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:26,886
Speaker 1: yeah, well in this case probably.

321
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:34,370
Speaker 1: but basically if You watch this video without knowing it's real you would assume it's from a TV show like that is the level.

322
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:35,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is from a TV show.

323
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:36,703
Speaker 0: It's called cops.

324
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:54,770
Speaker 1: Yeah But it keeps alternating between the dude in the front having this really hilarious standoff with this derp cop and meanwhile in the back his girlfriend is trying to sneak out and Has multiple attempts of sneaking out of the building all of which end of disaster.

325
00:22:55,071 --> 00:23:00,510
Speaker 0: Oh, I remember the one that I saw which is better than yours is the one that is mashed up with Metal Gear Solid.

326
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:02,084
Speaker 1: Oh, I did see that one.

327
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:02,690
Speaker 1: That was really good.

328
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,356
Speaker 0: That's the one that's better.

329
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:05,070
Speaker 0: So you should post that one because it's better than yours.

330
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,200
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day is that this video.

331
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:08,245
Speaker 1: you've probably seen it.

332
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:09,230
Speaker 1: It really made the rounds.

333
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:14,430
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is that people are mashing this up with all sorts of different music.

334
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,454
Speaker 0: Metal Gear one's the best one.

335
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:16,981
Speaker 1: The Metal Gear one is the best one.

336
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,030
Speaker 1: Yakety Sax is the obvious one.

337
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,874
Speaker 1: I haven't even.

338
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:21,482
Speaker 0: I only thought of Yakety Sax one.

339
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:22,910
Speaker 0: I didn't actually see one but I did see the.

340
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,194
Speaker 0: I'm sure it exists.

341
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:28,510
Speaker 1: And the Lupin the third one works surprisingly well.

342
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,103
Speaker 1: So, yeah, you can enjoy this.

343
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:32,808
Speaker 1: so what do you got for me?

344
00:23:33,732 --> 00:23:39,330
Speaker 0: So, you know, there's a. there are Jews have a lot of different levels of you know, observancy, right?

345
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,190
Speaker 0: There are people who are only barely Jewish and there's people who are very very very Jewish.

346
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:48,550
Speaker 0: Right and the ultra-orthodox and Hasidim in their neighborhoods around the world.

347
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:53,230
Speaker 0: Some of their neighborhoods are known to be unfriendly to outsiders.

348
00:23:53,371 --> 00:24:04,616
Speaker 0: So if you were to if they were to see you in public, you know disobeying their laws I mean, perhaps you were a woman not wearing enough clothes or you come into their neighborhood But you're not a person that they like.

349
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:08,910
Speaker 1: I've been yelled at by people in a certain neighborhood in Brooklyn biking there.

350
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:10,879
Speaker 0: Right, they will do things to you.

351
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:13,350
Speaker 0: Like some of them will throw tomatoes at you, right?

352
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,529
Speaker 0: This is a real thing that happens.

353
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:31,189
Speaker 0: So here is an animated gif and the title of the animated gif is ultra-orthodox men drenching sweet innocent girl in bike lane because you know, they there's a. there's a sweet innocent girl biking through their neighborhood and That is exactly what this video is.

354
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:32,112
Speaker 0: 100%.

355
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:38,148
Speaker 1: this is a good video and you should watch it and you may enjoy it in the meta moment.

356
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:44,550
Speaker 1: the book club book Probably not next Thursday, but the following Thursday isn't gonna be a geek nights next Thursday.

357
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:47,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think with two weeks.

358
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,264
Speaker 0: I think I can get this done.

359
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,710
Speaker 1: I think it's not a long book.

360
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:52,276
Speaker 0: We are going to talk about most of the way done already.

361
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:57,590
Speaker 1: Yep, Emily Wilson's modern translation of the Odyssey by Homa.

362
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:58,673
Speaker 1: It's fantastic.

363
00:24:58,693 --> 00:24:59,596
Speaker 1: We keep talking about it.

364
00:25:00,037 --> 00:25:00,639
Speaker 1: Just read it.

365
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,909
Speaker 1: You could probably start it today and finish it before us.

366
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:10,983
Speaker 1: Yes It's not long and unlike the translation you read in high school or middle school much more readable.

367
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:16,842
Speaker 0: It's Not full of ye olde fancy talk.

368
00:25:17,425 --> 00:25:28,410
Speaker 1: it's enjoyable Directly and at face value even if you do zero Analysis and don't worry about any of the metaphor and also the forward gives you all the analysis you possibly need.

369
00:25:28,631 --> 00:25:32,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, where I don't even know what we're gonna talk about other than just repeating what the forward says.

370
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:37,107
Speaker 1: Yep I think I'm mostly gonna talk about how my opinion of Odysseus himself has changed.

371
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:39,781
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Also all the slave stuff.

372
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:42,515
Speaker 0: Yep That's in the forward.

373
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:51,008
Speaker 1: yeah that that is in the forward but it really hits home when you're reading it Mm-hmm, like especially the knowledge you get bit cuz she's got a lot of slaves like a lot.

374
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:56,677
Speaker 1: otherwise, uh We are going to be at Pax West.

375
00:25:56,998 --> 00:25:58,443
Speaker 1: you didn't buy a badge for it.

376
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,188
Speaker 1: Well, that sucks.

377
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,034

00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,963
Speaker 0: still you don't live close do not buy what.

00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:22,469
Speaker 1: That's where it was last.

402
00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:26,739
Speaker 1: It's a really great con.

403
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:31,829
Speaker 0: it was worth it to go for a few hours Just like we went last year and I saw like of all the in.

404
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,690
Speaker 0: You know the places are people showing off, you know video games and indie games that they made.

405
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:40,345
Speaker 0: That was the best one that I've seen way better than those sheeps meows and stuff.

406
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:41,569
Speaker 0: I saw real good shit there.

407
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:43,373
Speaker 0: So It's worth it.

408
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,261
Speaker 0: If you're in New York, that's Josephine this picture.

409
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,149
Speaker 1: I think there's pictures of our all our friends here.

410
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:54,806
Speaker 0: Okay, but yeah If you're in New York City It is worth it to go there for a few hours during the day to check out the awesome games there.

411
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:58,820
Speaker 1: Yep, and also You know, I'm not saying you should do this.

412
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,670
Speaker 1: This is not a geek nights thing or anything.

413
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:06,304
Speaker 1: But unless it's like pouring rain Me and Scott and Emily and a bunch of our friends are gonna do.

414
00:28:06,324 --> 00:28:10,681
Speaker 1: the Harlan Valley rail ride Which we talked about we did it last year is the best bike ride.

415
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:11,484
Speaker 0: It went on last year.

416
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:18,661
Speaker 1: It was it's way fun and There is a version of it for literally all levels of skill.

417
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:27,648
Speaker 1: if you can make a bike go forward without falling over You could do one of these rides and the smallest one 28 miles 28 miles something like that.

418
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:38,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's gonna take a slow person like my mom like four or five hours 23 33 45 57 72 hours Probably three hours for a normal person.

419
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:41,229
Speaker 1: a hundred and the I'm not doing it a hundred.

420
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,661
Speaker 1: There's two centuries one of them.

421
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:45,250
Speaker 0: just I'm doing baby hundred.

422
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:49,247
Speaker 1: I'm either gonna do baby hundred or 72 because I don't know if it's 72 last year though.

423
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:49,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I might do it again.

424
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,673
Speaker 1: It was real fun.

425
00:28:50,974 --> 00:28:54,468
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do baby hundred and if for some and it's like I can definitely finish it.

426
00:28:54,508 --> 00:28:56,917
Speaker 0: No problem But there is the escape hatch.

427
00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:59,627
Speaker 0: right it's like but the only the only question is it's not.

428
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:00,410
Speaker 0: will I finish it?

429
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,215
Speaker 0: It's will I finish it in time?

430
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:03,459
Speaker 0: Cuz I don't go I don't have a puff.

431
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,084
Speaker 1: So I have enough.

432
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:08,856
Speaker 0: if I don't finish it in time I'll just hop on the the escape vehicle.

433
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:10,220
Speaker 1: I think mostly it's.

434
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:14,358
Speaker 0: I gotta probably make it at least 80, you know Whatever the time limit is.

435
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could do the 80 instead of the 72 Mmm, I think the problem is it's like.

436
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:20,566
Speaker 0: it's like only eight miles more.

437
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:21,730
Speaker 0: Why would I do 72?

438
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,050
Speaker 0: It's because the 80 has way mad crazy hills compared to the 72.

439
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,127
Speaker 0: That's why those eight miles are hellish.

440
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,253
Speaker 0: eight miles They tack on.

441
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:29,982
Speaker 1: the hundred is from the regular.

442
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:31,791
Speaker 1: hundred is probably easier than that 80.

443
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:35,450
Speaker 0: That's why I'm doing the regular baby hundred the leg saver hundred is what they call it.

444
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:46,190
Speaker 1: But the cool thing is basically what we do is we take like Metro North up there with our bikes and other people drive Or whatever and we just can't for free just in this park in town and you can go up as early as Friday night.

445
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,874
Speaker 0: now They changed it.

446
00:29:47,055 --> 00:29:48,606
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna get there Saturday morning.

447
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:51,397
Speaker 0: I think Saturday Time we went there Saturday afternoon.

448
00:29:51,437 --> 00:29:52,059
Speaker 0: That was too late.

449
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:55,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like Saturday late morning is the perfect time to get there.

450
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,502
Speaker 0: Yeah, hang out go to sleep early get a good rest.

451
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:00,390
Speaker 0: That way you can wake up early and bike right away.

452
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:05,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if it's you me and Emily and our friends, we should eat at the more expensive tapas place.

453
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:06,980
Speaker 0: Mmm, who knows if it's any good though.

454
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:07,946
Speaker 1: I looked at some reviews.

455
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:08,590
Speaker 1: It seems like it's good.

456
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:13,128
Speaker 1: It seems like the only complaint people had was that it's way expensive compared to the cheapo Italian place.

457
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:13,549
Speaker 0: We hit it.

458
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:19,819
Speaker 1: Mmm It's one of those places that like New Yorkers take the train up for a nice bed-and-breakfast Weekend and that's the place they all.

459
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:21,389
Speaker 0: it's a little town that has nothing going on.

460
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:29,702
Speaker 1: Yeah that's why I don't want to get there the day to restaurant town because I Don't think there is a second day's worth of stuff for us to do.

461
00:30:29,723 --> 00:30:31,750
Speaker 0: there is biking and enjoying the nature.

462
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,634
Speaker 0: That's what you do up there.

463
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:36,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if we're already gonna bike and enjoy the nature an additional day Let's do it extra.

464
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:38,861
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess we just bike around.

465
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:39,583
Speaker 0: There's a lake there.

466
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,166
Speaker 0: You can swim in.

467
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:42,816
Speaker 0: Yeah Didn't see probably mad full.

468
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,764
Speaker 1: Oh and there's something new this year.

469
00:30:44,784 --> 00:30:49,125
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a hot shower truck Last year, I didn't get a shower till I got home.

470
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:49,649
Speaker 0: That's right.

471
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:52,057
Speaker 1: So you might hear this word.

472
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:58,002
Speaker 1: like Silicon Valley tech pros use this word a lot If anyone ever tells you that something is really is already old hat.

473
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,166
Speaker 0: I don't think they use this anymore.

474
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:02,837
Speaker 1: the sharing economy Yeah, so they still only care about coins.

475
00:31:03,098 --> 00:31:07,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, well coin crypto the crypto coin sharing economy.

476
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:18,848
Speaker 1: But sharing economy is one of those phrases like cryptocurrency Where if the person who says the phrase is not making fun of it, they're probably a person to avoid.

477
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:28,428
Speaker 1: Yes, and We're not gonna talk about the like intrinsic problems of the sharing economy Like why uber is evil because you should know by now we talk about it kind of often.

478
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:31,210
Speaker 0: But I got a whole thread in our forum about uber here on our evil day.

479
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:36,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we're not gonna dive in how the other uber like companies are not as evil but are also evil.

480
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:43,759
Speaker 1: Yep We're not gonna get into how all these things just exist and not have to pay people a living wage or give them Health benefits and it's all a giant scam.

481
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,445
Speaker 0: cuz that doesn't have to do with the sharing part.

482
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:47,293
Speaker 0: that has to do with being an Evil business.

483
00:31:47,594 --> 00:31:47,795
Speaker 1: Yep.

484
00:31:47,936 --> 00:31:50,910
Speaker 0: So we do those things with or without having a sharing business.

485
00:31:51,131 --> 00:32:04,969
Speaker 1: So there's been a bunch of news in on the coasts and in the middle of the country - weirdly About all these bike sharing scooter sharing car sharing things that are not uber and lyft though Some of them are becoming lyft right or uber.

486
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:12,846
Speaker 0: Well, the idea is that you know back in the day you would if you needed a thing you could buy that thing You could rent that thing at least that thing, right?

487
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,609
Speaker 0: You could borrow that thing from a friend.

488
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:30,684
Speaker 0: But the sharing idea is like well a company owns the thing and you basically you rent it but you rent it for a very short time and actually what you do is you buy some sort of membership and Then you can use that thing whenever and it's like well, that's what a gym is that?

489
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:32,410
Speaker 0: that is exactly what a gym is.

490
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:47,364
Speaker 0: it's a room full of machines and You pay money on a monthly basis and then you have free to use those machines as you wish Except here instead of having one, you know place full of stuff You just have the stuff all over the fucking place.

491
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:52,330
Speaker 1: now the theory of that I'm actually really okay with partly because long as it's a non consumable good.

492
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,495
Speaker 0: So it's like you could have.

493
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:57,150
Speaker 0: you know, for example, you don't have a straw sharing service, right?

494
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,118
Speaker 0: It's like hypodermic needle sharing service.

495
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:02,170
Speaker 0: For example, we have laundromats, but you go to laundromat you pay per use.

496
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:09,421
Speaker 0: What if there was a chain of laundromats and you could wash all the clothes you wanted in any one of the laundromats as long As you pay a monthly fee, I would be all over that.

497
00:33:09,663 --> 00:33:11,150
Speaker 0: I know why don't we start that business?

498
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:20,622
Speaker 0: Maybe we should but I mean basically people have used this model for basically transportation mostly bicycles cars Yeah, bicycle.

499
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:21,750
Speaker 1: Go back to the gym example.

500
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:28,889
Speaker 1: In the suburbs what people tend to do is just buy everything they want because they don't want to share it with people and they Want and they have places to keep shit.

501
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:31,450
Speaker 1: Yup, and I've noticed that there seem to be two reasons.

502
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:38,270
Speaker 1: But half the reasons people do this are They don't want other people touching their stuff and they don't want to interact with those people.

503
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:45,550
Speaker 0: But the other half the reason you live in a suburb with a house that's far away from the street is they don't to interact With other human beings because you're antisocial and bad.

504
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:50,370
Speaker 1: You got a hundred houses and ever and then in those houses are a hundred treadmills and a hundred weight machines.

505
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,352
Speaker 0: Yeah You can tell.

506
00:33:51,393 --> 00:33:56,033
Speaker 0: if you look at a neighborhood if you see houses that are up on the street and are close to each other And have porches.

507
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,626
Speaker 0: that's a friendly neighborhood where people talk to each other and have good times.

508
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:08,795
Speaker 0: if you see a neighborhood We're all the houses of gates or have real long driveways and big ass front yards And no porches.

509
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:11,667
Speaker 0: That's a bad neighborhood where people though are not friendly.

510
00:34:11,687 --> 00:34:15,786
Speaker 1: Don't talk to each other Yeah, but I like the idea like in the city like I could buy exercise equipment.

511
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:16,449
Speaker 1: That'd be stupid.

512
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,335
Speaker 0: Where are you gonna keep it?

513
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:18,020
Speaker 1: Where am I gonna put it?

514
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,885
Speaker 1: This apartment's tiny.

515
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:33,748
Speaker 1: So instead people in cities just share things with each other and Usually you have to charge a reasonable amount of money or else because you have to have one You know group that maintains all the somethings.

516
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:43,984
Speaker 1: Yep But there are some problems with it because if you have sharing things that are free or cheap enough What tends to happen is really common things just get trashed.

517
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,027
Speaker 0: tragedy of the come.

518
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:55,636
Speaker 0: Yep So the general business model at least for gyms is that you people are paying this monthly fee But you've only got so many Treadmills at your gym.

519
00:34:55,917 --> 00:35:01,143
Speaker 0: if everyone who paid came all at the same time to use a treadmill You wouldn't have enough treadmills.

520
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:01,990
Speaker 0: you'd be in deep shit.

521
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:10,881
Speaker 0: The reason it works is because you have people who pay who never fucking come but they keep paying and you make a lot of Money that way because you don't need to buy that many treadmills.

522
00:35:10,921 --> 00:35:12,910
Speaker 0: You don't need to rent that much commercial real estate.

523
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,874
Speaker 0: Yeah You know you can.

524
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:14,604
Speaker 0: just you can.

525
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:23,278
Speaker 0: your expenses are at way low compared to the number of people who join and keep paying and forget to cancel and They join and they use it a whole bunch.

526
00:35:23,318 --> 00:35:29,522
Speaker 0: when they first join in January for New Year's their resolution And then the whole rest of the year they pay and only but in July.

527
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:33,557
Speaker 0: only hardcore people are there and most of the gym is empty and you're totally chillin.

528
00:35:33,577 --> 00:35:40,510
Speaker 1: and it's always funny because there's a gym in my building and It's pretty much exclusive to me because like no one's ever down there.

529
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:49,513
Speaker 0: Yeah everyone in this building is Technically in their rent paying for the maintenance and upkeep and equipment in that gym and rim is the only one using it Every year.

530
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:51,718
Speaker 0: building makes a lot of money by having it.

531
00:35:51,858 --> 00:36:00,061
Speaker 1: Emily uses a lot too, but every year for about three weeks after New Year's I can't go down there because it's completely full of people and by February.

532
00:36:00,081 --> 00:36:01,826
Speaker 1: They're all gone and it's my private gym again.

533
00:36:01,846 --> 00:36:10,699
Speaker 1: I Think maybe four or five times ever other than January if I gone down there and there wasn't a treadmill to use Right when I wanted to use it.

534
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:12,710
Speaker 0: Did they have a fake not moving bicycle?

535
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:13,953
Speaker 1: They got one of those.

536
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:16,164
Speaker 1: I actually use it cut off it in the winter.

537
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:17,189
Speaker 0: That's the only gym equipment.

538
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:20,037
Speaker 1: with you I like lifting weights.

539
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:21,908
Speaker 1: I lift a lot more weights than I used to.

540
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:25,215
Speaker 1: You feel you feel a lot better.

541
00:36:25,236 --> 00:36:26,701
Speaker 1: if you lifted some weights I can lift my mouse.

542
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:28,147
Speaker 0: so here's the deal.

543
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:33,463
Speaker 1: in New York City We had a thing called city bike Which I signed up for and so did Emily.

544
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,495
Speaker 1: like we all used it I didn't sign up.

545
00:36:35,515 --> 00:36:39,856
Speaker 0: I didn't sign up for it until they put it right next to my house some months ago And then I signed up for it.

546
00:36:40,017 --> 00:36:43,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you might ask like less than a year ago, Roman Scott Why did you use this thing?

547
00:36:43,295 --> 00:36:56,906
Speaker 0: You actually my new my new job gives me free membership But I can't take advantage of that and so my current membership expires And it's actually already become a very very critical part of New York's commuting.

548
00:36:56,966 --> 00:37:02,101
Speaker 0: even though I own two Bicycles for one person I use city bike a lot.

549
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:02,763
Speaker 1: Yep.

550
00:37:03,144 --> 00:37:04,970
Speaker 1: And the reason I use it though I use it.

551
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:15,529
Speaker 1: I don't have a membership right now But I'm thinking about getting it again now that there's one right outside my building one been outside your building longer than been outside My building true, but when I first signed up it cost less than half what it costs now.

552
00:37:16,412 --> 00:37:18,062
Speaker 1: So I signed up because it was so cheap.

553
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:21,683
Speaker 1: It was also cheap Yeah, but it is more than double what I originally pay.

554
00:37:21,703 --> 00:37:22,889
Speaker 0: It's like a hundred something a year.

555
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:25,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, I used to pay like I pay more than that for the subway for a month.

556
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:29,472
Speaker 0: true And I probably use city bike more than he is the subway this month But I'll keep.

557
00:37:29,652 --> 00:37:34,209
Speaker 0: I decided I'll just keep paying the MTA the full price every month because I'll subsidize it.

558
00:37:34,812 --> 00:37:47,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can afford to whatever and also I like the freedom of never Yeah, but When they originally made the bike share in New York City this city by thing the deal is that the bikes are awful.

559
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,460
Speaker 1: They're like 55 pounds and made out of steel.

560
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:51,705
Speaker 0: They vary a little bit.

561
00:37:51,725 --> 00:37:53,030
Speaker 0: They're not all exactly the same.

562
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,003
Speaker 0: Some of them have different shifters and stuff like different lights.

563
00:37:56,385 --> 00:38:04,259
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of variance But for the most part they're all bikes where the there's no top bars, you know It's so you can eat you can step in real easy.

564
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,624
Speaker 0: You adjust the seat.

565
00:38:05,664 --> 00:38:07,010
Speaker 0: You can't take the seatpost out.

566
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:12,587
Speaker 0: Alright, they all have about three speeds inside of a one of those internal gearing like.

567
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:13,430
Speaker 0: what are those called again?

568
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,936
Speaker 1: Oh the hub gears hub gears.

569
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:17,227
Speaker 0: They have all of at least three speeds on a hub gear, right?

570
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,837
Speaker 0: They're heavy as hell.

571
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:20,690
Speaker 0: The tires are enormous.

572
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,179
Speaker 0: There's really really slow and really hard.

573
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:24,721
Speaker 0: But you know what.

574
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:26,387
Speaker 0: I can bike it over the bridge.

575
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:27,310
Speaker 0: I can bike it anywhere.

576
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,121
Speaker 0: It's like I can ride it pretty much anywhere.

577
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:29,584
Speaker 0: I need to go.

578
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,393
Speaker 0: the worst bike It'll get you there.

579
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:35,308
Speaker 1: the worst bike the shittiest scooter is still infinitely better than walking.

580
00:38:35,669 --> 00:38:39,635
Speaker 1: Yep So when they originally did it we got a lot of like.

581
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:52,310
Speaker 1: there was a lot of resistance to it mostly from all the Garbage scam companies that rent bikes to tourists in Central Park Yep, and all the bike shops who are worried that people won't buy bikes anymore and won't rent bikes from them.

582
00:38:52,531 --> 00:39:00,850
Speaker 1: Well, they were all wrong actually But I saw something that something like 30% of all bike shops in New York went under since city bike opened.

583
00:39:01,111 --> 00:39:02,015
Speaker 0: Oh, well deal with it.

584
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:03,342
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't get.

585
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:04,990
Speaker 1: even the bike shop right here is gone.

586
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,850
Speaker 0: Now is it because the city bike though that bike shop?

587
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,781
Speaker 1: I think it's gone because this neighborhood gentrified very rapidly.

588
00:39:10,802 --> 00:39:12,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you can't make a lot of money with the bike shop.

589
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:16,381
Speaker 0: No I mean, is it the Ben's best deli out in Forest Hills?

590
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,890
Speaker 0: matter business and they blame the bike lane on Queens Boulevard.

591
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:21,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and it's like even so.

592
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:22,321
Speaker 0: here's the thing right with that.

593
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:24,367
Speaker 1: Let's say let's say they're right.

594
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:25,390
Speaker 1: I don't care, right?

595
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,027
Speaker 1: It's likely more important than any business, right?

596
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:29,389
Speaker 0: Exactly It's like all right.

597
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:36,570
Speaker 0: If it is probably not true that the bike lane put you out of business the reason you're awesome Judelli, which has amazing food that I want to eat went out of business.

598
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:41,209
Speaker 0: It's because that food is expensive and people don't really eat pastrami sandwiches every day like they used to.

599
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:45,090
Speaker 0: Right, but let's say it was the bike lane that put you out of business.

600
00:39:45,512 --> 00:40:00,113
Speaker 0: Well, guess what since 2015 when they put that bike lane in Queen's Boulevard Previously known as Boulevard of death has had zero people die zero, which means putting in that bike lane absolutely Undisputably.

601
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:03,270
Speaker 0: save somebody's life at least once probably more than once.

602
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:16,285
Speaker 0: Which means if you if you're complaining about that bike lane putting you out of business What you're saying is that we should murder people to keep Ben's best deli open in which case I say, all right Let's murder Ben's best owners children to keep Ben's best deli open.

603
00:40:16,306 --> 00:40:18,636
Speaker 0: that'll save him the money He needs to spend on their education.

604
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:20,623
Speaker 1: He might be like, okay win win.

605
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:24,274
Speaker 0: Well then, okay, I Can't argue with someone.

606
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,078
Speaker 0: Is that evil?

607
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:27,850
Speaker 0: But yeah, you you see where I'm going?

608
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:35,602
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what's interesting is that city bike was sort of aimed at tourists and the reason why they doubled the price And like change the business because tourists did not.

609
00:40:35,904 --> 00:40:37,010
Speaker 0: I do see tourists using it.

610
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,776
Speaker 1: I do see tourists using it but not enough.

611
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:43,556
Speaker 0: almost everyone who used it was like me and New Yorkers are using it and paying The annual fee.

612
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:45,430
Speaker 0: it's like a hundred something annual fee.

613
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:49,445
Speaker 0: But city bike as much as you want and I think I can describe the three reasons people use it.

614
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:52,909
Speaker 1: reason number one They're trying to get cross town.

615
00:40:53,372 --> 00:41:05,622
Speaker 0: Yep, if you don't know in New York the public transportation Which even though it runs 24/7 and even though we complain about it still is way better than other places To the point where you can actually use it Doesn't really go left and right.

616
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:07,070
Speaker 0: it only handle is in Manhattan.

617
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:08,670
Speaker 0: It mostly goes up and down.

618
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:20,190
Speaker 0: so if you're in First Avenue and you want to get to 10th Avenue, you can find a bus or Walk or use a city bike and city bike is absolutely the fastest way in no matter what.

619
00:41:20,451 --> 00:41:23,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, no matter where you're standing and city bike is the fastest.

620
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,359
Speaker 1: The second reason is to get to places.

621
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:27,610
Speaker 1: the subway doesn't serve that well, right?

622
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:32,005
Speaker 1: You're somewhere out in Brooklyn or like Kips Bay or something.

623
00:41:32,045 --> 00:41:33,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, kiss bays a good one, right?

624
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,530
Speaker 0: It's like well, you need to get to the train.

625
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,490
Speaker 0: Well, the six trains pretty close, but you got to walk to the sixth train.

626
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:42,687
Speaker 0: It's gonna take you like 15 minutes, but if you city bike to the sixth train, that'll take you like two minutes Yep.

627
00:41:43,091 --> 00:41:51,661
Speaker 0: And so you can get to a place in Manhattan or even anywhere in New York where the trains nearby But not super nearby like even my apartment.

628
00:41:52,003 --> 00:41:53,910
Speaker 0: I could walk to the train in under 10 minutes.

629
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:57,030
Speaker 0: I can city bike to the train in less than two minutes.

630
00:41:58,692 --> 00:41:59,937
Speaker 0: I use it just to go to the train.

631
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,953
Speaker 1: and the third reason I think a lot of people use it is when there's a Subway problem.

632
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:07,445
Speaker 1: suddenly you see people running out of the subway station and all the city bikes are gone.

633
00:42:07,506 --> 00:42:09,910
Speaker 0: last night when I went home From the fireworks, right?

634
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:10,672
Speaker 0: So it's.

635
00:42:10,752 --> 00:42:16,976
Speaker 0: I went out of the apartment and I felt some drops and I checked and they were not air conditioner We're random water drops.

636
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:17,821
Speaker 0: It was rain.

637
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:22,769
Speaker 0: So I said well, it's raining So I'm not gonna city bike which is usually the fastest way home from here.

638
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:27,510
Speaker 0: And I saw that the end train up above was messed up.

639
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,928
Speaker 0: There was a fire and I saw a message on my phone that said he was messed up.

640
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,013
Speaker 0: So I went.

641
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:37,974
Speaker 0: and anyway if it's raining the bus is better because the bus goes right to my apartment and then doesn't mean yeah I don't have to walk in the rain.

642
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:38,838
Speaker 1: Yeah.

643
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:41,790
Speaker 0: So remember I said that the the train is like 10 minutes walking, right?

644
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,297
Speaker 0: I don't want to walk 10 minutes get wet.

645
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,830
Speaker 0: So I went over to the bus and a bus came.

646
00:42:46,051 --> 00:42:46,935
Speaker 0: It was 100% full.

647
00:42:47,558 --> 00:42:48,221
Speaker 0: I couldn't get on it.

648
00:42:48,322 --> 00:42:49,266
Speaker 0: the bus driver closed the door.

649
00:42:49,286 --> 00:42:53,168
Speaker 0: Yeah Like I tried to get on the bus start the bus driver was like no mo.

650
00:42:54,131 --> 00:42:57,620
Speaker 0: So then another bus does not come.

651
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:58,903
Speaker 0: it just doesn't come.

652
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:03,860
Speaker 0: people are packing it up in the in the station hiding under the scaffold and no buses come.

653
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:04,163
Speaker 0: none.

654
00:43:04,183 --> 00:43:08,441
Speaker 0: and Cabs come and I'm not paying one of one of those new.

655
00:43:08,682 --> 00:43:09,525
Speaker 0: not for no reason.

656
00:43:09,866 --> 00:43:12,189
Speaker 0: and then I realized wait a minute It's not fucking raining.

657
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:19,970
Speaker 0: So I walked to the nearest city bike and I pull pull it out and that's got a fucking front flat tires front the front.

658
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,089
Speaker 0: The front tire is flat and I was like god damn it.

659
00:43:22,753 --> 00:43:30,989
Speaker 0: I put it back in and I try to push the repair button to which will lock that bike in place and no one can accidentally take it and will let them know that it needs fixing.

660
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,950
Speaker 0: and the repair buttons broke.

661
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,440
Speaker 0: So luckily that doc had one other city bike at it.

662
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,202
Speaker 0: That was not broken.

663
00:43:38,222 --> 00:43:39,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I took it and went home.

664
00:43:40,972 --> 00:43:45,150
Speaker 0: Without that I would had to like walk all the way down 21st Street to get home.

665
00:43:45,431 --> 00:43:47,640
Speaker 1: So the more like it is why we talk about city bike so much.

666
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,950
Speaker 1: is that in our experience as New Yorkers?

667
00:43:50,432 --> 00:43:52,841
Speaker 1: It is 100% a success story.

668
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:57,898
Speaker 1: It is actually one of the better things that's happened to Transportation in the city in a long time, right?

669
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:58,379
Speaker 1: It is now.

670
00:43:58,419 --> 00:44:06,730
Speaker 1: it is so important now that a city bike outage Gay like it is as dire to some people as a subway problem or a bus problem.

671
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like.

672
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:10,065
Speaker 0: there are times they're all like, okay, I go to the end train.

673
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:11,190
Speaker 0: It's busted.

674
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:17,390
Speaker 0: Well, if I can get to you know, where rim lives I can get on a different train like our train or whatever.

675
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:21,969
Speaker 0: right, but I got to get there and Everyone else is already running for the bus.

676
00:44:22,155 --> 00:44:24,176
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like.

677
00:44:24,216 --> 00:44:28,250
Speaker 1: also how many people like I know who say bike is a critical part of their commute.

678
00:44:28,391 --> 00:44:35,184
Speaker 1: Usually they take a ferry because we have a new ferry system, too And the all and all the ferry docks because they're on the water kind of out of the way.

679
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:41,937
Speaker 1: There's a million city bikes Mm-hmm and people take the ferry and take the city bike because you don't want to take a Your own bike to.

680
00:44:41,957 --> 00:44:42,882
Speaker 0: the ferry does not go.

681
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:44,270
Speaker 0: the ferry goes near my apartment.

682
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:45,546
Speaker 0: It does not go near my work.

683
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:49,490
Speaker 0: So if I were to take the ferry on the other end, how do I get to work?

684
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:51,809
Speaker 0: There's not any subways near it on the other end.

685
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:56,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have it, but there is a city bike dock right there next to the ferry terminal on the other end.

686
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,223
Speaker 1: So why is city bike so good and so well run?

687
00:44:59,584 --> 00:45:00,629
Speaker 1: because New York City?

688
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,698
Speaker 1: Basically wallet technically a private company runs it.

689
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:06,743
Speaker 0: New York City just got bought by Lyft.

690
00:45:06,844 --> 00:45:08,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get into that.

691
00:45:08,549 --> 00:45:16,418
Speaker 1: New York City Came down on this thing like a hammer and said oh you want to build this in our city We gotta follow our rules.

692
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,070
Speaker 1: and they're basically running it like it's an extension of the subway.

693
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,620
Speaker 0: They just put it everywhere.

694
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:21,305
Speaker 0: It's everywhere.

695
00:45:21,547 --> 00:45:22,070
Speaker 0: It's spread.

696
00:45:22,251 --> 00:45:22,934
Speaker 0: You know, it's not.

697
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:26,130
Speaker 0: it's not really everywhere, but this is in fact in my raccoon wounds.

698
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,816
Speaker 0: They spread it a whole bunch.

699
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:30,023
Speaker 0: You can't walk without seeing one.

700
00:45:30,124 --> 00:45:33,556
Speaker 1: The docks have a ton of bikes on them I see when I bike to work.

701
00:45:33,696 --> 00:45:37,329
Speaker 1: I see easily hundreds of people on city bikes also biking to work.

702
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:38,295
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm granted.

703
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:40,790
Speaker 1: I bike to work on my actual bike because I have a bike.

704
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:43,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have one too and I have a bike room in my office.

705
00:45:44,315 --> 00:45:51,047
Speaker 0: I don't use city bike to go all the way to work But like if maybe I take the subway to work Yeah, then I take the subway here to do a podcast and they'll use a city bike to go home.

706
00:45:51,228 --> 00:45:53,557
Speaker 1: exactly I I've even paid one off.

707
00:45:53,577 --> 00:45:56,429
Speaker 0: so I'm not gonna use a city bike to go home today because I have my real bike here.

708
00:45:56,824 --> 00:45:57,892
Speaker 0: Yeah Yep One of them.

709
00:45:58,575 --> 00:46:05,526
Speaker 1: and also it makes it really accessible to people who can't afford to own a bike people who live in apartments too small To have bikes or don't want to worry about their bike and stolen.

710
00:46:05,707 --> 00:46:10,622
Speaker 1: Yep People who just didn't bring their bike today and now it's nice out.

711
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,103
Speaker 0: That's me.

712
00:46:11,846 --> 00:46:13,270
Speaker 1: That is often me, right?

713
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:25,539
Speaker 0: So the idea see the thing is you can see how When you had this business model of you had you own stuff and then people pay a fee to have access to the stuff whenever It can totally work, but it keeps.

714
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,621
Speaker 0: different companies keep implementing it in ways that are Slightly or very very evil, right?

715
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:33,510
Speaker 1: So I think this comes down to regulation.

716
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:38,890
Speaker 1: No, the only reason the New York one works so well, is that the city heavily regulates.

717
00:46:39,212 --> 00:46:42,710
Speaker 0: We talked about the gyms and how they do and that's only slightly sketchy, right?

718
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,988
Speaker 0: It's like it's your fault for buying a gym membership and not using it.

719
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:49,130
Speaker 0: But you know, they could remind you that you're not using it and tell you to cancel, but they're not gonna do that.

720
00:46:49,317 --> 00:46:49,446
Speaker 0: Yeah.

721
00:46:49,811 --> 00:46:54,345
Speaker 0: But then you get the companies like the uber who take it to the maximum evil where it's like.

722
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:57,154
Speaker 0: you're sharing this car This well this show.

723
00:46:57,174 --> 00:46:59,380
Speaker 1: you're sharing this exploited chauffeur.

724
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,810
Speaker 0: It's a chauffeur and a car and people are sharing it, right?

725
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,727
Speaker 0: It's the same idea Except yeah, they pay the chauffeur basically nothing.

726
00:47:07,748 --> 00:47:11,607
Speaker 1: Yep And they ignore regulations and there's all sorts of problems.

727
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:16,142
Speaker 1: Yeah, so The other thing about these city bikes that they have docks there.

728
00:47:16,182 --> 00:47:18,270
Speaker 1: They're like a subway station or a bus stop.

729
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:23,590
Speaker 0: There's a dock and the bikes had you get your trip has to start and end at one of these locations.

730
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:28,992
Speaker 0: otherwise you get charged an arm and a leg for stealing the prick holding the bike too long and You have to.

731
00:47:29,052 --> 00:47:32,850
Speaker 0: if you're a tourist you got a dock every 30 minutes that you can go for more than 30 minutes.

732
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:38,649
Speaker 0: You're even without paying again, you just have to dock and then take another bike or the same bike again.

733
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:40,898
Speaker 0: I if you're not a tourist you have an ant.

734
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:41,963
Speaker 0: you pay the annual fee.

735
00:47:42,304 --> 00:47:47,848
Speaker 0: you can do 45 minutes But then you got a dock and then take a bike out and frankly you're not riding this more than 45 minutes, right?

736
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,836
Speaker 0: Well, they're doing it to make sure.

737
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:50,780
Speaker 0: why did they do this?

738
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,110
Speaker 0: to make sure that you don't bike way far away from the docks.

739
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:59,730
Speaker 1: Yep, you got to keep it in the system relative Oh, and if you don't leave the bike in a dock and it gets stolen they charge you like thousands.

740
00:47:59,871 --> 00:48:08,111
Speaker 0: If you don't dock within 45 minutes You just start racking up the fees and if you never put it in a dock again, you can get charged $1,200.

741
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:09,222
Speaker 0: Yeah, so don't fuck it.

742
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:17,930
Speaker 0: So there's all these startups and ever I whenever I slam the bike in the dock I always wait for the notification that it was confirmed to dock before before I walk away.

743
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:33,757
Speaker 1: So there's all these startups and things trying to do like more clever bike share scooter shares a thing now or electric bike shares And most of them are ignoring regulations like if someone tries to do an electric bike share in New York Electric bikes are illegal here.

744
00:48:33,898 --> 00:48:36,509
Speaker 1: Anyway, yep, so that won't fly.

745
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:43,450
Speaker 0: But the arguments we made about whether they should be and stuff like that, but I think they should be but they should be heavily regulated.

746
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:52,630
Speaker 1: So then there's these companies like lime and jump that are basically trying to do the same thing Depending on the city.

747
00:48:53,051 --> 00:49:02,810
Speaker 1: they're doing it without the city's permission and they're just leaving bikes around with no docks that have like GPS trackers and Self-locking hubs and they just leave them on the fucking sidewalk.

748
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:07,025
Speaker 1: And if you buy their at you use their app, you can just leave the bike wherever.

749
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:17,369
Speaker 1: they'll just take care of it Mm-hmm, and it seems like what's happening is people are just picking these bikes up and throwing them in dumpsters Leaving them in people's lawn just leaving them all over the place.

750
00:49:18,712 --> 00:49:26,064
Speaker 1: Some cities are actually just rounding them up and throwing them away like garbage because They never the companies never got permission to actually do anything.

751
00:49:26,104 --> 00:49:26,526
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

752
00:49:26,586 --> 00:49:27,590
Speaker 0: what's this random bike?

753
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:28,937
Speaker 0: Just sitting here on the sidewalk.

754
00:49:28,957 --> 00:49:29,842
Speaker 0: That doesn't belong here.

755
00:49:29,882 --> 00:49:33,176
Speaker 0: It's taking up sidewalk space Right, and the thing is what they're doing.

756
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:38,150
Speaker 0: really that's wrong is it's not that oh your bike share doesn't have this docking mechanism?

757
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:38,554
Speaker 0: It's like.

758
00:49:38,797 --> 00:49:40,110
Speaker 0: that's not really the problem.

759
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:54,210
Speaker 0: yeah, the problem is is that you're putting this bike on a sidewalk that is public property and using it that public property as the land of your private business without Compensating forward or getting permission and you're just getting everyone's way.

760
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:58,570
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if you want to set up, you know, a little a little vending stand in the sidewalk.

761
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:03,670
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of rules about that because you're taking up this public space for your private business and your private profit.

762
00:50:03,992 --> 00:50:07,290
Speaker 0: You know, you're not buying real estate or renting commercial real estate, you know.

763
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:13,817
Speaker 0: It's like I can't just go outside and like just set up a studio and in the public park and be like, oh it's mine now This is my space now.

764
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,165
Speaker 0: It's like no, it's not your land.

765
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:15,910
Speaker 0: It's public land.

766
00:50:16,432 --> 00:50:20,690
Speaker 0: So when you put your dockless bikes out there, you're putting them on this public land.

767
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,771
Speaker 0: I don't belong there You didn't?

768
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:25,486
Speaker 0: you know, you're not compensating the public for your use of that land for a profit.

769
00:50:25,847 --> 00:50:26,490
Speaker 0: get the fuck out.

770
00:50:26,731 --> 00:50:30,373
Speaker 0: But the docks even though they're you know, taking up this space It's like.

771
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:32,428
Speaker 0: well the DoD like said you could.

772
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:35,297
Speaker 0: they Specifically got rid of parking spaces to put docks there.

773
00:50:35,357 --> 00:50:35,498
Speaker 0: more

774
00:50:35,538 --> 00:50:54,370
Speaker 1: importantly by regulating them heavily the city's basically treating them like infrastructure And as a result they get the right level of attention respect Regulation and control to make sure that the system serves the purpose of bettering the lives of the people in the place as opposed to Monetizing some start-up that's paying its employees probably in stock.

775
00:50:54,475 --> 00:51:00,810
Speaker 0: Yeah So the DoD in New York City did it actually are going to legalize and give permission to the dockless one.

776
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,110
Speaker 1: But it looks like they're doing it are out neighborhood.

777
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:04,180
Speaker 1: They're doing it the same way.

778
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,170
Speaker 1: they do with the green cabs.

779
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:08,467
Speaker 1: If you don't know in New York yellow cabs are the real regular cabs.

780
00:51:08,788 --> 00:51:10,491
Speaker 1: they work Medallions.

781
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:13,021
Speaker 0: you should not get in a cab that is not yellow.

782
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:15,270
Speaker 1: Nope, but well you can get in a green one.

783
00:51:15,611 --> 00:51:20,930
Speaker 1: Yes, because the green ones if the green one will let you in the green ones are special.

784
00:51:21,271 --> 00:51:26,852
Speaker 1: They work totally like a normal cab in New York except they cannot pick anyone up in Manhattan.

785
00:51:27,113 --> 00:51:28,942
Speaker 0: yep, so and they can't pick you up in an airport either.

786
00:51:29,043 --> 00:51:33,690
Speaker 1: Yep, but it cost way Less to ride them and way less to get a license for them, right?

787
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,354
Speaker 0: So if you want to have if you want to drive a yellow cab It needs to have this medallion on it.

788
00:51:37,735 --> 00:51:42,029
Speaker 0: and the price of the medallions have gone way down because of uber being evil.

789
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:44,918
Speaker 0: Yep But the yellow cabs are legit.

790
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:47,550
Speaker 0: So you shouldn't ride any ubers or lifts or any of that garbage.

791
00:51:47,611 --> 00:51:48,930
Speaker 0: You should get any yellow or green one.

792
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:56,939
Speaker 0: But if you're in Manhattan a green one can't turn on the meter because the GPS lock not to work when the car is in Manhattan you can they can drive you to Manhattan.

793
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,870
Speaker 0: They just can't drive you when they're already in Manhattan Yep.

794
00:52:00,092 --> 00:52:02,855
Speaker 0: But the idea was well Look, there's people who want it.

795
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:06,370
Speaker 0: you need a cab who are in Queens the Bronx Brooklyn far away.

796
00:52:06,712 --> 00:52:13,510
Speaker 0: No, yellow cabs are coming over there, even though they come near me And those people need rides and there's not enough yellow cabs.

797
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:21,650
Speaker 0: So we'll allow pretty much anyone To make a green cab and but we'll make it so the green ones don't compete with the yellow ones and such and such.

798
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:26,810
Speaker 1: Yep, so in terms of car shares cuz you know, I've talked about this before I used to use a car.

799
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:28,408
Speaker 1: I ditched it because it's garbage now.

800
00:52:28,891 --> 00:52:36,264
Speaker 1: But the reason car shares have really failed to work in major cities Like every definitely can't work in a suburb.

801
00:52:36,304 --> 00:52:37,168
Speaker 0: Everyone has a fucking car.

802
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:38,809
Speaker 1: Yep You have to have a car to live in the suburb.

803
00:52:39,312 --> 00:52:46,621
Speaker 0: The only people who don't have cars in the suburbs are the kinds of and even if you do live in it if it's suburb Without a car that how you gonna get to the bike share.

804
00:52:46,721 --> 00:52:48,187
Speaker 0: It's I mean to the car share.

805
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:48,890
Speaker 0: you're gonna bike there.

806
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:59,449
Speaker 1: It's far away yep, and also I suspect the people who live in the burbs don't have cars are too poor for The company that's running the car share to be able to successfully exploit them.

807
00:53:00,954 --> 00:53:12,990
Speaker 1: so in the city the car share was great because the only reason anyone in New York wants a car share is To be able to rent a car to leave the city for a weekend without having to talk to a human being right?

808
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:13,798
Speaker 0: There's no way.

809
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:19,205
Speaker 0: if you're living the city You don't need a car except when you're leave going on a somewhat longish trip.

810
00:53:19,225 --> 00:53:19,667
Speaker 0: You don't need it.

811
00:53:19,868 --> 00:53:21,675
Speaker 0: within the city We have public transportation.

812
00:53:21,735 --> 00:53:24,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, like we had all this other stuff and you're going to another city.

813
00:53:24,808 --> 00:53:25,330
Speaker 1: You don't need it.

814
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:27,389
Speaker 1: You just fly or take an Amtrak right or a bus.

815
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:30,592
Speaker 0: Yeah if you're going from a major city to a major city you don't need a car.

816
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:35,816
Speaker 0: the times you need the car is when you're living the city and You're going to a suburb.

817
00:53:35,856 --> 00:53:43,430
Speaker 0: like I'm gonna go to the I'm gonna go on a trip to the woods or you know Something like that that and the train doesn't go where I'm going.

818
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:53,649
Speaker 0: I need to go visit someone who lives out in Long Island and they're not near the Long Island Railroad And it would take me four hours to bike there and if I took the long on railroad I'd have to take a cab from the train station to them.

819
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:57,290
Speaker 0: Anyway, that sort of that's when you need a car for someone who lives in the city.

820
00:53:57,712 --> 00:53:59,361
Speaker 0: So that's that's when you want.

821
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:02,234
Speaker 0: one is only of those occasions But I car.

822
00:54:02,555 --> 00:54:06,930
Speaker 0: usually you're gonna end up taking the car on Friday after work and bringing it back late on Sunday.

823
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:18,310
Speaker 1: Yep so you no one can make money having car shares in the cities because one No one really needs a car for like a couple hours in the city unless they're moving in which case they probably just rent a.

824
00:54:19,112 --> 00:54:23,243
Speaker 0: Right, so you basically all the cars that would be shared would be sitting there unused.

825
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:28,649
Speaker 0: Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday disappear on the weekend And then on Friday, there wouldn't be enough of them.

826
00:54:29,091 --> 00:54:30,637
Speaker 0: Right because they're taking up space like that.

827
00:54:30,677 --> 00:54:32,604
Speaker 0: parking spaces cost the money right.

828
00:54:32,664 --> 00:54:34,370
Speaker 0: the cars just sitting there cost the money.

829
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,194
Speaker 0: They're not being used.

830
00:54:35,395 --> 00:54:37,104
Speaker 0: you're losing money every day of the week.

831
00:54:37,144 --> 00:54:40,329
Speaker 0: those cars just sitting there They're not integrated into the transport system.

832
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:44,326
Speaker 0: The city bikes outside are constantly going in and out and in and out in and out.

833
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:45,170
Speaker 0: all the data is public.

834
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,990
Speaker 0: You can look at every city bike ride and see how they get used a ton.

835
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:57,890
Speaker 0: These cars are sitting there five days of the week not making any money and then all of them get used exactly once for three Days, that's when all the money comes in and then they get parked again.

836
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:13,930
Speaker 1: Now you'd think because when they first I remember when they first did it They put these zip cars at a lot of the Metro North stations way up north The idea being you come out of the city you pick up the zip car Do your thing whatever you're doing upstate in the woods and bring the car back to the sit to the train station when you're done.

837
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:29,088
Speaker 1: But even then that wasn't enough because most of the people who need a car in that situation Tend to drive it somewhere and want to leave it there like for their commute Which again is not part of the transit system, so it won't actually work, and you can't easily monetize it.

838
00:55:29,128 --> 00:55:35,942
Speaker 1: and on top of all that Uber and cabs seem to have filled the gap of.

839
00:55:36,283 --> 00:55:38,210
Speaker 1: someone needs a car to take them somewhere.

840
00:55:38,832 --> 00:55:46,930
Speaker 1: It's easier to take your evil uber to the Costco and from the Costco Then it is to rent a car from a car share to do it yourself.

841
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,249
Speaker 1: Yeah.

842
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:56,235
Speaker 0: So I think what you have to do to make this work is You would need to find a some other way to make money from those cars Monday through Friday.

843
00:55:56,295 --> 00:55:58,943
Speaker 0: right maybe get some shitty hotels.

844
00:55:59,586 --> 00:56:02,395
Speaker 1: you can sleep in them For 40 bucks.

845
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:06,028
Speaker 0: I think what you could do is you could have people do you know?

846
00:56:06,771 --> 00:56:26,483
Speaker 0: Uber-type driving with those cars Monday through Friday, and then on Friday They that driver has to park the car by a certain time You know maybe like two or three and then it becomes Rented to the person who's gonna take it out of the city and they had to bring it back by Sunday And then Sunday night, then then the person can start driving it again.

847
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:27,748
Speaker 1: Ah, but here's the problem with that.

848
00:56:27,768 --> 00:56:36,050
Speaker 1: for hire the thing city city bike Irrespective of its monetization because I'd be fine if the city just ran it for free with our tax dollars.

849
00:56:36,874 --> 00:56:38,221
Speaker 0: but it's the same other way.

850
00:56:38,502 --> 00:56:46,009
Speaker 1: it achieves a meta purpose of Adding more transportation to the city like it improves the quality of life of people in the city.

851
00:56:46,891 --> 00:56:51,088
Speaker 1: Anything that puts more cars on the road decreases the quality of life of people.

852
00:56:51,229 --> 00:56:59,099
Speaker 0: right well I think the idea is that hopefully this would decrease cars on the road if it works because You're gonna you have cabs driving everywhere already right.

853
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:03,970
Speaker 0: so this is going that one that uber driver Just replacing it as already an uber driver.

854
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,805
Speaker 0: Who's just gonna be doing this instead and it's gonna work on the weekend right.

855
00:57:07,227 --> 00:57:15,889
Speaker 0: and then There's someone out there in the city who owns a car and only uses it a few weekends and all the other weekends It's parked and not moving all the rest of the time.

856
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:20,346
Speaker 0: Well, maybe you can convince that person if this exists and hasn't.

857
00:57:20,406 --> 00:57:32,990
Speaker 0: there's actually enough cars And the price is right that they could sell their car and then use this instead and that would decrease the total number of cars Because just one of these shared cars could replace how many owned cars?

858
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:35,870
Speaker 0: Yep, that are only used on the weekends, but at the same time.

859
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:47,850
Speaker 1: The another way you could go is the model of people who own cars and use them usually could could Go into some sort of compact with other people like time shares on their own cars.

860
00:57:47,911 --> 00:57:50,335
Speaker 1: That's a model people have tried But that is something people have tried.

861
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:55,177
Speaker 0: the problem is people own cars for some reason don't like other people driving them Which I can see.

862
00:57:55,197 --> 00:57:57,290
Speaker 0: even if there's all kinds of insurance and stuff.

863
00:57:57,451 --> 00:58:02,569
Speaker 1: It's like you know I've seen the way other people drive And if I own a car I would never let fucking anyone drive.

864
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:06,450
Speaker 0: But I mean and even if it's no skin off your back if they crash insurance just buys you a new car.

865
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:07,010
Speaker 0: It's not your fault.

866
00:58:07,093 --> 00:58:12,422
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, true But then I don't set out upright that I might not have the car right after they crashed it or they might make it smell like pee.

867
00:58:13,771 --> 00:58:16,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you know insurance has to cover all those or handle all those problems.

868
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:26,290
Speaker 1: Yeah because one problem with all that like the city bikes and those kinds of bike shares is that They are treated with the same respect that people here treat the subway.

869
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:31,130
Speaker 1: They there's a reason they're 55 pounds because otherwise they would all have been destroyed.

870
00:58:31,814 --> 00:58:34,370
Speaker 0: You know I haven't seen people vandalize city bikes.

871
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:35,613
Speaker 1: No Why don't?

872
00:58:35,653 --> 00:58:39,490
Speaker 1: early on when they first appeared there was a bunch of vandals and then it just sort of stopped.

873
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:44,172
Speaker 0: I feel like what we could do is like take a city bike and then we've got you know Like we can.

874
00:58:44,232 --> 00:58:51,170
Speaker 0: if you keep docking and undocking it we can just like paint it real nice Not like like you know put artwork on it, and then put it back

875
00:58:53,032 --> 00:58:55,199
Speaker 1: Unauthorized, but I mean that's technically vandalism, but yeah,

876
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:58,550
Speaker 0: I mean you know a lot of street art is that kind of end?

877
00:58:58,693 --> 00:58:59,207
Speaker 1: That is true.

878
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,746
Speaker 1: All right, I think we killed enough time.

879
