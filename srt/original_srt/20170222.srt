00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,559
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, February 22nd, 2017.

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,144
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:16,149
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:19,849
Speaker 0: tonight We're talking about miss Kobayashi's dragon maid.

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,828
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,817
Speaker 1: Have you heard of this new subreddit the bird?

7
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:28,780
Speaker 1: It's a relatively new as far as I know.

8
00:00:28,982 --> 00:00:29,931
Speaker 1: I'm newly aware of it.

9
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:31,282
Speaker 1: No matter how old it is I will see.

10
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:31,643
Speaker 0: we'll see.

11
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:31,804
Speaker 0: cuz.

12
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:36,000
Speaker 0: I found a few choice subreddits recent and it's called shower orange.

13
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:38,546
Speaker 0: Yes, I saw this.

14
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:39,910
Speaker 1: you saw the shower orange.

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,630
Speaker 0: first someone posted the rules to that subreddit and then later I went and actually saw the subreddit.

16
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:47,499
Speaker 1: So I tried to shower orange this morning.

17
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:49,803
Speaker 0: How'd it go?

18
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:51,268
Speaker 1: I went to the very.

19
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:52,834
Speaker 0: that's very Cosmo Kramer.

20
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:53,476
Speaker 1: I went to the.

21
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:54,440
Speaker 1: yeah pretty much.

22
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:58,073
Speaker 1: I went to the grocery last night and bought five oranges.

23
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:01,915
Speaker 1: and first of all, I gotta say Oranges are a bad deal.

24
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:05,931
Speaker 1: Orange juice is like expensive orange juice.

25
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:07,696
Speaker 1: It's like four dollars for like half a gallon.

26
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:08,980
Speaker 1: right for quality.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,931
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to make a half a gallon of orange juice from oranges right?

28
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:14,480
Speaker 1: five oranges was four dollars.

29
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:17,148
Speaker 1: Okay, and these aren't good Florida oranges.

30
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:20,020
Speaker 1: These are New York oranges that didn't have much flavor, right?

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,635
Speaker 1: So I bring the orange in the shower and a. it's convenient because you just wash it right there.

32
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:26,020
Speaker 1: It's nice and clean, right?

33
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:31,239
Speaker 1: Yeah - it gives you something to do in the shower beside when you're like maybe waiting for.

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,467
Speaker 0: well See the problem is right now.

35
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,886
Speaker 0: I got the waterproof cell phone So for the like.

36
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:38,248
Speaker 0: while I'm standing there for a few minutes every morning I'll actually just kind of read FARC.

37
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,017
Speaker 0: then I'll get about my business.

38
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:40,600
Speaker 1: anyway.

39
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,430
Speaker 1: It was a little bit hard to peel the orange.

40
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:50,237
Speaker 0: I don't have like fingernails and I gotta go to got to do the clementine if you want to peel it with your hand.

41
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:50,740
Speaker 1: It's wet.

42
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,304
Speaker 1: So, but I did it.

43
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:55,537
Speaker 0: I'd recommend cutting an incision into the orange before you go into the.

44
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:56,400
Speaker 1: I don't want to link any.

45
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:58,277
Speaker 1: I want to leak any shower into the orange.

46
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:01,349
Speaker 0: No, I mean you're in the shower with the orange.

47
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:03,640
Speaker 1: you're gonna see if it gets on the outside of the orange.

48
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:04,625
Speaker 1: That's not a problem.

49
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:07,680
Speaker 0: But as soon as it gets inside the orange water, what else are you gonna get in there?

50
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,556
Speaker 1: I don't want to eat soap.

51
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,448
Speaker 0: I Imagine you eat the orange like before.

52
00:02:11,488 --> 00:02:12,333
Speaker 0: you're fully soaked up.

53
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:18,380
Speaker 0: Nah, whatever anyway Actually, we're gonna put a garbage disposal in the bottom of the shower.

54
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:20,620
Speaker 1: I just took the peels out with me and threw them in the garbage.

55
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:25,520
Speaker 1: So when I open the orange, oh so this keeps going.

56
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:27,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

57
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,652
Speaker 1: So so so when I open the orange I began to understand why people like this.

58
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,540
Speaker 1: because it like the citrus odor just like went.

59
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:40,320
Speaker 0: And it was like you get that just by spraying like a puff of citrus saw while you're in there.

60
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:41,668
Speaker 1: Yes, you could but it was.

61
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,460
Speaker 1: it was from a real orange like it was so good.

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,474
Speaker 1: But the problem was that I disappeared like in less than a second.

63
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:49,340
Speaker 1: It was like, oh, it's gone.

64
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,528
Speaker 0: I guess gotta have a steady stream of oranges.

65
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, just keep opening oranges one after another on a conveyor belt.

66
00:02:56,323 --> 00:03:06,671
Speaker 1: and then I started eating the orange and I was just eating an orange and eating it in the shower wasn't any different than eating it outside the shower except Because I sort of had to take a shower.

67
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:08,240
Speaker 1: I kind of ate it in a hurry.

68
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:16,358
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, cuz always if I'm eating it outside, I'm gonna eat it like oh Like one wedge at a time, right, but I'm in the shower and it's like I have to finish showering.

69
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:18,726
Speaker 1: so I'm like, oh Right.

70
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:20,699
Speaker 1: So it changes that the eating part.

71
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:26,293
Speaker 0: Unless you have time to take a forever shower Which I usually do I kind of make time for that.

72
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is a morning shower.

73
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,182
Speaker 1: I want to see.

74
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:35,960
Speaker 1: I usually I've been taking more night showers, but because it was shower orange I took a morning shower on purpose because I figured that's what it'd be more effective.

75
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,711
Speaker 1: Anyway, who wants to eat an orange like late at night?

76
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I already got a message for the stream quote.

77
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,474
Speaker 0: I feel mildly uncomfortable looking at this subreddit.

78
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:53,969
Speaker 1: So I I ate the orange and then I finished taking a shower and I think The shower orange is not really all it's cracked up to be.

79
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:06,200
Speaker 1: but I'm withholding judgment because I think if I had I got a good orange from like Florida a fresh quality or a big old like hey one of those heavy feeling oranges.

80
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,226
Speaker 1: Oh, this is I got the right variety of orange.

81
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:12,600
Speaker 1: It just wasn't fresh and powerful and local and whatnot, right?

82
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,839
Speaker 1: So it wasn't when I opened it like each wedge only had a little bit of flavor.

83
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:18,151
Speaker 0: now I'm already imagining there might be forget the shower.

84
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,839
Speaker 0: The shower is just a pale imitation.

85
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,552
Speaker 0: You need to be floating in the ocean eating the orange.

86
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:23,255
Speaker 1: Sure.

87
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:24,862
Speaker 1: That'd be great But it's just.

88
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:36,180
Speaker 1: I need an orange that maintains its citrusy power and makes the whole shower Orange flavored and not just you know a whiff of orange flavor followed by a few bites of orange flavor.

89
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:43,520
Speaker 0: Hey this I feel like an orange cough drop will suffice Possibly yeah, also I could just you know my shower.

90
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:52,132
Speaker 1: Currently, you know, the the flavor that it has is the flavor of Neutrogena rainbat Much better flavor than orange.

91
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:53,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't want to drink that.

92
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:55,368
Speaker 1: No, I don't want to eat it.

93
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:59,911
Speaker 1: But I mean it when I as soon as I get the soap out That's the whole shower gets that soap flavor.

94
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:00,735
Speaker 1: and I had love.

95
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:01,680
Speaker 1: I use luxury hotel.

96
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,473
Speaker 1: So so it right and I don't really.

97
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:07,284
Speaker 1: if I wanted to replace that with orange I would just get orange.

98
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:09,914
Speaker 0: So see I use some service.

99
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,118
Speaker 1: They definitely make that.

100
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:14,549
Speaker 0: Yeah I just use like scentless sort of like sea salty soap soap.

101
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,713
Speaker 1: You haven't tried the rainbat.

102
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:16,596
Speaker 0: Yeah.

103
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:17,680
Speaker 0: Well, I haven't tried the orange.

104
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,429
Speaker 1: Orange is better than nothing.

105
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:27,825
Speaker 1: But so I guess if I was in a Shower that didn't have like a flavor and I wanted to flavor it up I'd get an orange.

106
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:29,657
Speaker 1: or if I maybe if I maybe I'd go with the grapefruit.

107
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,771
Speaker 1: if I go Grapefruit is actually one of these.

108
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:32,720
Speaker 0: it's banned.

109
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:37,977
Speaker 1: There's a wide variety of permitted citrus and grapefruit is not permitted and I agree.

110
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:43,560
Speaker 0: cuz grapefruits are awful I feel like I should make the grapefruit only one grapefruit to shower grapefruit.

111
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,114
Speaker 1: First of all this now you're getting the spoon in the shower.

112
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:54,629
Speaker 1: It's already a problem With your hands, yeah, you can know.

113
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:03,721
Speaker 0: the only thing stopping you is human decency And the fact that it makes a big mess, but in the shower also it tastes disgusting Amazing.

114
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,083
Speaker 0: It's great.

115
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:04,706
Speaker 0: Granted.

116
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:05,952
Speaker 0: I do not like eating raw grapefruit.

117
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,380
Speaker 1: I just drink hydrochloric acid.

118
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:15,881
Speaker 0: So, uh in the news and there's a bunch of news but I actually I want to talk about this because I caught up 100%.

119
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:18,572
Speaker 1: we've done this news before though on adventure time.

120
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:19,215
Speaker 1: We've done this news.

121
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:24,588
Speaker 0: So I have a geek bite of Reviewing the the miniseries because adventure time is actually only done.

122
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:27,776
Speaker 0: two of these miniseries that are sort of standalone.

123
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:33,190
Speaker 1: They did snakes which is Name really a miniseries is what I'm saying.

124
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,173
Speaker 1: It's just a more.

125
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,060
Speaker 1: it's more than two episodes that go together.

126
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,571
Speaker 0: Well, I say more and more.

127
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a series of episodes But stakes sort of told its own story about Marceline start to finish there.

128
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:50,039
Speaker 0: And what I think interesting about islands is that stakes just sort of like told this side story?

129
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,716
Speaker 0: Islands is like say adventure time had not occurred up to this point and like the next season adventure time was starting like the beginning of a show.

130
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:00,759
Speaker 0: Islands is almost like the prequel to that.

131
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:13,520
Speaker 0: Islands literally is Finn and a few other characters find out there might be humans somewhere and Go off as Susan strong to some islands to find out what happened to the last of the humans.

132
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,015
Speaker 1: It makes sense and it is not a spoiler.

133
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:16,740
Speaker 1: That's like obvious

134
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:37,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's deeply tied to the continuity and actually already I noticed some things in the background You know, although like in stakes and all these other things you see like other characters and flashbacks and in the background You see a lot of well corpses and items that indicate the statuses and dispositions and end states of a lot of those people.

135
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:53,074
Speaker 0: and It gave me a lot of confidence that the last season of adventure time which is not the one that's on now It's the one that airs next year because islands just occurs in the middle of the current season Which just has more episodes that are coming out.

136
00:07:53,094 --> 00:08:00,160
Speaker 1: at some point, I guess I'm sticking with my strategy of I stopped watching and I'm gonna watch again when the final episode comes out.

137
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:02,105
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go And be done.

138
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:12,900
Speaker 0: thing is I just started catching up because it's so good and I kind of forgot because Steven universe has been the Hotness lately and I like Steven universe my hurry, but adventure time Has quite a long-standing.

139
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:19,159
Speaker 0: I don't know you of its own thing and I think adventure time is a top-tier show.

140
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:24,967
Speaker 0: and Reminded of that by watching a bunch of it again Okay, also it's gonna end.

141
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,880
Speaker 0: so, you know your strategy shoes goose that I missed.

142
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:31,796
Speaker 1: Ah, I don't think there's any choose goose and there's no reason for me to hurry up.

143
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:32,419
Speaker 1: I can just wait.

144
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,371
Speaker 0: However, you you say this is your strategy.

145
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:35,974
Speaker 0: What are you gonna read?

146
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:36,294
Speaker 0: Dr.

147
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,004
Speaker 0: McNinchy because it is 100% done.

148
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:41,474
Speaker 1: as soon as I get a chance probably real soon.

149
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:42,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can just blow through it.

150
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,360
Speaker 0: I mean, it's you know, King radical was up to something and you're just gonna.

151
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:52,133
Speaker 0: Obviously, it's pretty good and it's a hundred hundred hundred hundred percent over.

152
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:53,196
Speaker 0: there will be never more.

153
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,341
Speaker 1: not even one more page of Dr.

154
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,846
Speaker 1: McNinchy will ever be created.

155
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:03,275
Speaker 0: In fact, if you go to the site now, it shows the first page of dr McNinchy and it warns you not to click back.

156
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:04,964
Speaker 0: Hmm All right.

157
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:06,411
Speaker 0: So you got any any news?

158
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:07,556
Speaker 1: Oh, I do have a news.

159
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:12,919
Speaker 1: So You know a lot of people have not seen as much Gundam as I've seen.

160
00:09:13,704 --> 00:09:16,260
Speaker 1: But maybe they're not opposed to seeing some Gundam, right?

161
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,380
Speaker 1: Maybe they're like, oh, you know, I do kind of want to see some Gundams, but I don't know which ones to watch.

162
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,267
Speaker 1: There's so many I don't understand right?

163
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:28,994
Speaker 1: Well, how convenient Hulu, which I recently Suspended my subscription because at South Park isn't on right now.

164
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:29,315
Speaker 0: Yep.

165
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,520
Speaker 0: I had also pause my Hulu.

166
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:32,780
Speaker 0: I got a c-roll going and I got the Netflix going.

167
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,020
Speaker 1: I only have c-roll right now because I'm watching you all paddle.

168
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:42,360
Speaker 1: I might turn it back on because they just added to Hulu five Gundams and there are five excellent Gundams.

169
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:46,512
Speaker 1: Gundam seed which is the HD version that does not even have dub.

170
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:47,615
Speaker 1: It's subtitle only.

171
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,320
Speaker 0: I could almost watch that again.

172
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,547
Speaker 1: Go just go right for it.

173
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:51,513
Speaker 1: Just go right into that.

174
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:55,400
Speaker 1: No problem They also got Gundam the origin which I kind of want.

175
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,753
Speaker 1: That's the one I would resubscribe to see because I read.

176
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:02,672
Speaker 1: I read the all the manga But I haven't seen the anime of Gundam the origin or 8th MS team.

177
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:04,880
Speaker 1: I got 8th MS team, which is way short.

178
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,487
Speaker 1: How many episodes is it like?

179
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:07,934
Speaker 0: like 8 not many?

180
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:09,140
Speaker 1: It's not a lot of episodes.

181
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,537
Speaker 1: You can watch this marathon that crab go watch this shit in a day even though there's actually 12 12 episodes.

182
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,474
Speaker 1: So that's like a one-day show, you know, you can watch it in like a week.

183
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:18,640
Speaker 1: You watch an episode every day.

184
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,879
Speaker 0: It's like a whole arc of utenna.

185
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,218
Speaker 1: Yeah Just watch two episodes every day and you'll see all of 8th MS team one of the best Gundams there is.

186
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,263
Speaker 1: it's on Hulu Right now.

187
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:28,720
Speaker 1: all of these are sub and dub except for Gundam seed, which is sub only.

188
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,763
Speaker 1: Gundam wing the one that was on Cartoon Network one that I never watched all the way through in order I only see.

189
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,460
Speaker 1: the only thing I've seen all the way through is the movie with the two mix music.

190
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:39,829
Speaker 1: I never saw the whole TV show.

191
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,520
Speaker 0: all the way to show also has to mix music.

192
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:46,613
Speaker 1: I mean if I watched Gundam the origin Maybe I'll actually do that and watch Gundam wing all the way through in order.

193
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,580
Speaker 0: and then what do you think the plot of Gundam?

194
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,105
Speaker 0: Wing is.

195
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:50,779
Speaker 1: so I'm just curious.

196
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:55,215
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of kids on a planet and there's some sort of war.

197
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:56,579
Speaker 1: There's an evil government.

198
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:57,583
Speaker 0: That's all.

199
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,591
Speaker 0: the good guys are the bad guys.

200
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,580
Speaker 1: kids are the good guys, but some of them are bad guys.

201
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:10,013
Speaker 1: are they and the kids get Gundams one Gundam per kid and There's that girl who's like, you know, basically Princess Leia.

202
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:10,957
Speaker 1: she's like in the government.

203
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:11,780
Speaker 1: She's like as Klein.

204
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:17,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and then there's a dude who's not char, but he's char and they must fight in space.

205
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,309
Speaker 0: Except I think they mostly fight.

206
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,037
Speaker 0: I think they also fight on the planet a lot.

207
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:23,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure They do that every Gundam.

208
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,984
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

209
00:11:24,064 --> 00:11:27,259
Speaker 1: and then this is dramatic part where you go into space and a dramatic part We come out of space.

210
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,105
Speaker 0: I gotta say so.

211
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,432
Speaker 0: if you three entries hell.

212
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:34,317
Speaker 0: if you have never seen Any Gundam somehow despite listening to geek nice you can.

213
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:34,800
Speaker 1: that's the best.

214
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:35,540
Speaker 1: This is what I'm saying.

215
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:42,260
Speaker 1: Is that all of these Gundams including the one I didn't mention yet Gundam double-o Which I have only seen a couple episodes of but I've never actually seen it.

216
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,360
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if it's any good or not because they've only seen two episodes and those weren't bad.

217
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,065
Speaker 1: Is it any of these Gundams?

218
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,960
Speaker 1: are Gundams that you can just watch right away with no Gundam knowledge whatsoever?

219
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't need to know nothing about no Gundams.

220
00:11:56,394 --> 00:11:57,560
Speaker 1: So I pick any one of these.

221
00:11:58,024 --> 00:11:58,972
Speaker 1: You can just start from episode.

222
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:03,336
Speaker 0: one of any of these I'm not even talking like oh, there's all this backstory.

223
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:04,040
Speaker 0: That won't matter.

224
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,010
Speaker 1: Like no, you can literally start from episode one of any of these.

225
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,331
Speaker 1: Yep.

226
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:07,953
Speaker 0: Got him.

227
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,060
Speaker 0: seed introduces the concept of a Gundam.

228
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,308
Speaker 1: Maybe Gundam the origin would be.

229
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:15,880
Speaker 1: I don't know if it like retails the whole thing or if it's just the parts that weren't.

230
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:20,206
Speaker 1: I don't know enough about it to say that for sure, but all the other ones Yeah, you can just start watching from nothing.

231
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:26,487
Speaker 0: if I had to recommend I'd recommend Gundam seed Because it's better.

232
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:31,120
Speaker 1: but Gundam seed will tell you gonna make the mess team is the best of these that I know of.

233
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, but gonna see like accessible Gundam seed is giving you.

234
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:37,581
Speaker 1: that is what all the other Gundams are Like.

235
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:44,272
Speaker 1: if you watch Gundam seed and then you go back and watch the original Gundam you be like, hey This is real similar to Gundam seed only like different characters.

236
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:46,320
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, that's how Gundam is.

237
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:48,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait, there's a mascot.

238
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:49,070
Speaker 0: what's going on?

239
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,455
Speaker 1: And then you watch Gundam wing you'd like.

240
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:51,198
Speaker 1: this is really some.

241
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:56,760
Speaker 1: yeah The same story retold with characters of different names and different looking robots.

242
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:58,447
Speaker 0: Well, except war in the pocket is just.

243
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:03,413
Speaker 1: war is sad war in the pockets even shorter than a semester Where the pocket is like one shot.

244
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,208
Speaker 1: It's like a movie basically Yeah, but anyway, but any of these are.

245
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,640
Speaker 1: all of these were like excellent choices to put up on the Hulu.

246
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:14,940
Speaker 1: So if you want to see Gundams your anime fan sign up for Hulu with the no ad version, you know.

247
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,654
Speaker 1: And then watch a Gundam and then turn it off.

248
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:19,359
Speaker 1: See you stop paying Cuz you don't want to pay for it even that you.

249
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:28,730
Speaker 0: So I use Twitter a lot and you keep tabs on Twitter.

250
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,196
Speaker 0: Like I check it pretty much all day.

251
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:38,834
Speaker 1: I read every single goddamn tweet Yep, and I have done so since I started using Twitter for real Tweet.

252
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:40,043
Speaker 0: I'm muting for a little while.

253
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:47,652
Speaker 1: every single tweet If anyone I follow is seen by my eyes and read and if I don't like tweets I unfollowed Aggressively.

254
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,074
Speaker 1: Yep.

255
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:51,790
Speaker 1: There's probably a bunch of people I follow that never tweet and I don't see any of their tweets.

256
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,594
Speaker 1: I don't unfollow them.

257
00:13:52,654 --> 00:14:00,508
Speaker 1: But if someone tweets badly or too much I unfollow Yep, and I it's tough now because I follow new things very rarely.

258
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:06,367
Speaker 0: Yep I just followed a new account a new ish account at least that it uses emoji to everyday tweet.

259
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:08,896
Speaker 0: one like Randomized roguelike dungeon.

260
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:15,579
Speaker 1: I recently discovered the Darwin Awards this Twitter account that constantly post focus Lou is retweeting that about people hurting themselves.

261
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're very funny, but there's too many of them sung and unfollow.

262
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:33,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, I trust a few I don't need like one of those a day not you know, ten Yep, but so last night around the same time Casey Green and Emi Sisorega Both tweeted these horrific cats.

263
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:42,130
Speaker 0: I saw these cats pretty much all morning this morning Yep, so I basically went and retweeted everyone in my feed who interacted with this thing and then I interacted with it.

264
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:46,230
Speaker 0: It is it's a neural network like learning experiment.

265
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,985
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of other practical stuff on this site like this.

266
00:14:49,065 --> 00:15:01,590
Speaker 0: one here is about Identifying the components of facades unlike buildings Like imagine that for like drone delivery, but it's neural networks figuring out what something is or interacting with it from training.

267
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:10,365
Speaker 0: but this one is trained to look at edges like lines like vector art and Find the cats or in this case what Scott drew the dick.

268
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:17,990
Speaker 1: Why don't we do this except instead of cats dicks and so usable under porn is the here's edges to shoes edges to hand.

269
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,309
Speaker 1: Why don't we do edges to dicks?

270
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:21,414
Speaker 0: Why why not?

271
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:22,739
Speaker 0: Let's learn this.

272
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:23,181
Speaker 0: Let's see.

273
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:24,767
Speaker 0: So it uses tensorflow.

274
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:28,640
Speaker 0: chair We can learn that pretty easily make edges to dicks.

275
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:28,981
Speaker 0: I read it.

276
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:30,245
Speaker 1: You want advertisement on it.

277
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:30,928
Speaker 1: You'll make a fortune.

278
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,930
Speaker 0: I read I read a tutorial on tensorflow.

279
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:36,806
Speaker 1: I tried to read a tutorial on it and it said dude all this math.

280
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:39,684
Speaker 1: and I said fuck you You're supposed to do the math for me and I didn't understand it.

281
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:42,267
Speaker 1: just to dicks?

282
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:47,621
Speaker 0: Yes It does not yet exist.

283
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:51,169
Speaker 0: Yes Feel the hatred flow.

284
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:53,560
Speaker 1: When then it must have a counterpart.

285
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,504
Speaker 1: it just to boobs.

286
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:57,430
Speaker 0: No, it's just dicks Just dicks also boobs.

287
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:13,524
Speaker 0: Anyway, if you draw or attempt to draw a cat of some kind into this thing it will use machine learning and the height of modern technology to find the cat in it and This has already taken over Twitter for like three days.

288
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:17,379
Speaker 0: so you can just go enjoy it and Everyone will forget about it in like a week.

289
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:18,827
Speaker 1: Okay, is that it?

290
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:19,310
Speaker 1: That's it.

291
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:22,569
Speaker 1: So back when we were in college, we went to hockey games.

292
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:32,002
Speaker 1: Yep, and you know sporting events at colleges, you know, the crowds are smaller The crowds are more rabid and dedicated and well organized and they're more.

293
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:38,130
Speaker 1: it's the same people every time right who are going to every Single game it's not and sitting in the same place every single game.

294
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,590
Speaker 1: Not like a professional sporting event where there's thousands of people who are mostly there like one shot.

295
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,059
Speaker 1: It's the only game they're gonna see that season.

296
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,226
Speaker 1: your gear ever, right?

297
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:58,100
Speaker 1: So We used to do all sorts of organized chanting to mess with the goalie of the other team primarily Yeah, and also enjoy ourselves more Skate skate, but this is not unique to hockey.

298
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:06,194
Speaker 1: It also happens in the baseball and here is the best one I've seen of the baseball And Yeah, it's Texas.

299
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:07,078
Speaker 1: So fuck them.

300
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:08,925
Speaker 1: But hey, good job.

301
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:10,534
Speaker 1: I Enjoy this.

302
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:11,180
Speaker 1: keep doing it.

303
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:18,810
Speaker 0: I am amazed Not that they do this because you know, like you said this is a kind of common thing the sheer persistence of this particular.

304
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:22,930
Speaker 1: I'm not amazed that if we had a thing like that at RIT, would we have persisted?

305
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,308
Speaker 0: But we I mean the corner crew like to get the corner going and you could get.

306
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:26,710
Speaker 0: it's true.

307
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,470
Speaker 1: They have an entire baseball stadium going which is much larger than a little corner crew.

308
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:30,931
Speaker 1: Yeah,

309
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:36,170
Speaker 0: like this this is the kind of thing where you imagine like a mother teaching her daughter like listen

310
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:42,846
Speaker 1: I also think it's easier to persist when you have that many people because like you can take a break and then someone else takes A break and you get back into it.

311
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,850
Speaker 0: But there's also a fine line where the more people you have the more possibility of fracture.

312
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,174
Speaker 0: I mean look at a Rangers game You can't get.

313
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:53,650
Speaker 0: let's go Rangers going consistently for more than like two runs of it tops.

314
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:55,055
Speaker 1: It's very it's not easy.

315
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:56,620
Speaker 0: Like you started let's go Rangers.

316
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,710
Speaker 0: The dude fucking next to you will be out of sync immediately.

317
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:03,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Texas A&M my head is off to you.

318
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:04,369
Speaker 0: That's not bad.

319
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:08,873
Speaker 0: in the meta moment the book club book is Frank Herbert's.

320
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:13,184
Speaker 1: do not hide it because we've never done a we.

321
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,390
Speaker 0: neither one of us has actually read it all the way through.

322
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,623
Speaker 0: We just know a lot about dune because that's kind of pop culture II.

323
00:18:18,704 --> 00:18:20,170
Speaker 0: but we don't know it that well.

324
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,049
Speaker 0: Like I know way more about the wheel of time than I do about dune.

325
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:24,869
Speaker 1: So I guess that's true.

326
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:35,201
Speaker 0: In fact because I've read all of the wheel of time I'm in that club of people who know about the wheel of time and I understand now why those people Always want to talk to other people about wheel of time.

327
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:37,270
Speaker 1: So you want to join the dune club do know?

328
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,069
Speaker 0: I'm reading the first book of dune.

329
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:48,029
Speaker 0: I am confident that even though somehow I read all of wheel of time from that first book we did I am confident I will not have the desire to read the second dune book.

330
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:51,046
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't have the desire to read the first dune book in middle school.

331
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:51,790
Speaker 1: So let's find out.

332
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll see.

333
00:18:53,617 --> 00:19:02,916
Speaker 0: we're going to be live real soon on Friday Not this week not next week But the following week Friday at 6 p.m.

334
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:05,243
Speaker 0: In the bumblebee theater redoing a panel at PAX East.

335
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:07,288
Speaker 0: play dirty to win.

336
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:23,263
Speaker 0: and Let me tell you that that panel already got to the point where there is a line and beyond that line are additional slides Of winning techniques that even I will not use Panel I think I got.

337
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:24,512
Speaker 0: I got a Cuz.

338
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:25,216
Speaker 0: I was like here.

339
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:28,934
Speaker 0: here's the panel to Scott and Scott was like no no, no, you need to push it You need to go deeper.

340
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:31,745
Speaker 0: That's right, and we went deeper and it's still going deep.

341
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:33,190
Speaker 0: The bottom is not there yet.

342
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:35,808
Speaker 0: I think the bottom might be actually kill your opponent.

343
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:43,329
Speaker 0: No, like yeah, but like ahead of time so they don't show up to the tournament and you get a bye in the second round anyway.

344
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:57,406
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you should follow me and Scott on YouTube and we're doing a thing because in the last 12 years We have done a lot of Game nights episodes and a lot of those happen to be reviews of board games.

345
00:19:57,889 --> 00:20:10,070
Speaker 0: However While many people might particularly enjoy our style of board game review I feel like very few people who review games actually go to the depth that we go into or A lot of them are often wrong about things.

346
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,750
Speaker 0: But anyway, I think our board game reviews are pretty good, but they're buried under all that other crap that happens.

347
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,124
Speaker 0: Let's talk about cat dicks and you know edges to dicks and all that nonsense.

348
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:29,630
Speaker 0: So I'm taking Every single board game review we have ever done and putting them on YouTube with just Slideshows of images of the games and just the board game review and nothing else.

349
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:33,406
Speaker 1: Why would you want to listen to audio on YouTube when you could get the mp3?

350
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:34,350
Speaker 1: you just skip ahead?

351
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:37,018
Speaker 0: So skip ahead to where I don't.

352
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:39,530
Speaker 0: it's not like there's a time code saying because we could figure it out.

353
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,722
Speaker 1: You listen for the thing of the day part and then you you know, what do you mean?

354
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:42,285
Speaker 0: listen for?

355
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,250
Speaker 0: that already means like scroll?

356
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,595
Speaker 0: Forward nope scroll.

357
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:44,976
Speaker 0: Nope.

358
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:45,378
Speaker 0: Nope.

359
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:46,040
Speaker 0: Nope.

360
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,321
Speaker 0: Okay.

361
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:47,204
Speaker 0: Now there's that music.

362
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:48,710
Speaker 0: They're still talking about dicks.

363
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,976
Speaker 1: Someone wants to do that.

364
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:52,625
Speaker 1: That's on them, but no one's gonna do that.

365
00:20:53,871 --> 00:21:02,784
Speaker 0: Also, it is difficult to unless I make a separate podcast feed of just the main bits Most people can't be asked and most people don't even realize the podcast.

366
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:03,647
Speaker 1: Well, that's good.

367
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:04,670
Speaker 1: They shouldn't didn't waste time?

368
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:07,120
Speaker 0: No, so YouTube feels like a better way for this.

369
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:14,341
Speaker 0: Plus that's the kind of thing that'll actually get Shared if someone's like hey play this game They'll actually link to a YouTube but they're not gonna link to.

370
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:16,289
Speaker 1: you're gonna link to a YouTube that just shows images.

371
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:18,866
Speaker 0: They seem to be popular already.

372
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,949
Speaker 0: People are said that's how things go.

373
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:29,485
Speaker 0: So what I say to you is if you like our board game reviews You should check this out and send these to the people, you know, who are too dumb to listen to podcasts.

374
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,977
Speaker 0: I Think that's it.

375
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:35,511
Speaker 0: We can talk about the dragon show Dragon.

376
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:39,627
Speaker 0: yeah, I've been watching other anime which Scott hasn't and I'm not watching yo a pedal.

377
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:40,490
Speaker 1: I'm like a pedal.

378
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:41,133
Speaker 0: I think I'm.

379
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:45,715
Speaker 0: uh, I don't have anything else to say about yo a paddle It's nothing.

380
00:21:45,735 --> 00:21:46,519
Speaker 1: there's nothing new to say.

381
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,505
Speaker 1: It's just more of the same.

382
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:53,076
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like Initial D Like I didn't even watch all of initially.

383
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:54,782
Speaker 0: I kind of stopped around fourth stage.

384
00:21:54,842 --> 00:21:56,589
Speaker 0: It's just kept going and stop.

385
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:01,160
Speaker 0: Karen Pons are really good, but you haven't watched any of that stuff.

386
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,130
Speaker 1: So anyway, it's Dragon Maid show.

387
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,730
Speaker 1: So everyone was talking about the Dragon Maid show.

388
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,298
Speaker 1: we got mentioned to me by like multiple people.

389
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:11,614
Speaker 0: it filled my Twitter feed like to a degree that I was shocked by Like.

390
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:16,872
Speaker 0: I just out of nowhere for like a week nothing with dragons in my Twitter feed and Then it went away.

391
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:21,390
Speaker 0: and actually as of now the thing that's filling my Twitter feed is that kimono friend show.

392
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:22,414
Speaker 1: I don't know what that is.

393
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:26,310
Speaker 0: But anyway, that's animal people, but it's kind of like a dameko dobe.

394
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,195
Speaker 0: It's the one that we.

395
00:22:27,255 --> 00:22:27,878
Speaker 1: that's a good thing.

396
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,895
Speaker 0: It's the thing that we assumed doing Judge anime by its cover.

397
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:35,525
Speaker 0: that it was gonna be a worse version of dameko dobutsu.

398
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:36,568
Speaker 1: is it so?

399
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:37,089
Speaker 0: I don't know.

400
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:46,890
Speaker 0: But it has got some Twitter staying power and a lot of people are saying no It looks low production value and not that good but stick with it a few episodes and everyone's like flipping out about this show.

401
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:48,640
Speaker 1: So anyway, Dragon Maid.

402
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,310
Speaker 1: I heard about Dragon Maid from multiple people.

403
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:55,350
Speaker 1: So I said well ice multiple people have said something and friends are coming over.

404
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,646
Speaker 1: So let's watch this thing because Natalie was already way into it and Judith hadn't seen any.

405
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:04,721
Speaker 0: so yep I mean I were like, well, I like dragons.

406
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,290
Speaker 1: We watched every episode that was on crunchyroll.

407
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:19,630
Speaker 1: so the first thing about the show is it's made by the same studio that made lucky star and a bunch of garbage and The show is just like every other show that they've made Right, so

408
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:25,590
Speaker 0: Now I really I do like lucky star but that that those kinds of shows are not forever.

409
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,950
Speaker 0: Those are the kinds of shows like Excel saga where your friend who's away.

410
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:31,818
Speaker 1: This isn't as crazy as that.

411
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:38,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, but your friend is way into anime tries to get you to watch it But yet it's really only for people who are way in and it is deaf.

412
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:53,930
Speaker 0: This show is definitely for only people who are into anime first of all, but this this show Kobayashi So, you know made a dragon is for people who are into monster girls Moe but like edging into moe not like not like current moe.

413
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:57,602
Speaker 0: This is like it's like one step away from getting into the creepy stuff.

414
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:06,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you also are in The girl the tiny girl dragon, yeah, but at least as far as I only watched the first four episodes they haven't gone.

415
00:24:10,836 --> 00:24:12,330
Speaker 1: So I don't wanna say the show is bad.

416
00:24:12,491 --> 00:24:14,520
Speaker 1: Right because it's like it's.

417
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,946
Speaker 0: it's good enough to where like.

418
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:17,112
Speaker 0: I kept watching it I didn't.

419
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:19,490
Speaker 1: it's a. I watched it because that's what we were doing.

420
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,229
Speaker 1: I wouldn't I wouldn't personally wouldn't have gone past episode like two.

421
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:27,507
Speaker 1: But like it's good at what it is is but what it is is not a thing.

422
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:27,989
Speaker 1: I want.

423
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:28,934
Speaker 1: Yeah It's.

424
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,465
Speaker 1: it's like there are some funny bits.

425
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:36,404
Speaker 1: for example There's the evil dragon guy fat after and it's like he is a funny.

426
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:38,450
Speaker 1: is his character is a funny joke, right?

427
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,329
Speaker 1: He's an evil dragon.

428
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:48,343
Speaker 0: He's dark and you know He wants to like in the first episode where she calls him for advice and he's just like kill all the human kill all Who see your treasure trust?

429
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:49,150
Speaker 0: No one kill?

430
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,619
Speaker 1: It's like he is a play likes to play video games.

431
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,290
Speaker 1: It's like that's a funny character, but that joke gets old.

432
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:59,650
Speaker 1: It's only funny like two times and then he's not funny anymore.

433
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:04,203
Speaker 1: He's just did right and there's a lot of boobs and stuff which it's like.

434
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,550
Speaker 1: at my limit of tolerance for boobiness.

435
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,743
Speaker 0: I'm like, alright, it's definitely at the limit like it's at.

436
00:25:09,763 --> 00:25:13,603
Speaker 1: it's like if there's any more fan service I would like burn this with fire, but it's like.

437
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:15,734
Speaker 1: alright, that's the most fan service I can take without hurting.

438
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:21,617
Speaker 0: so on one hand it is refreshing that it's two girls But on the other hand it is.

439
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:24,185
Speaker 0: it is definitely at least 50% male gazey.

440
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:26,233
Speaker 1: Yeah It's not.

441
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:27,160
Speaker 1: there is the thing right?

442
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,510
Speaker 1: It would be cool.

443
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:32,910
Speaker 1: It's cool that it's like a lesbian action right the female dragon and the female human.

444
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I like how she is like.

445
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:40,010
Speaker 0: the normal girl is kind of just like this nerdy programmer normal person, right?

446
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:46,770
Speaker 1: The problem is is they at least in the five episodes worth they don't make it explicit, right?

447
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,350
Speaker 1: It's like just the dragon girl is obviously all over the regular girl.

448
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:59,044
Speaker 1: There's nothing on explicit about that, but the regular girl is not Reciprocating in any way other than allowing allowing her to live in the house.

449
00:25:59,546 --> 00:26:00,850
Speaker 0: She holds your hand a little bit.

450
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,959
Speaker 0: She puts up with their crap when he's holding the hand.

451
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:07,430
Speaker 1: It's not like who holding the hand like my love story.

452
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,083
Speaker 1: It's holding the hand like come with me.

453
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:09,970
Speaker 1: Stop messing around.

454
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:12,879
Speaker 0: They're just really good friends, right?

455
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:13,320
Speaker 0: I don't know.

456
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:22,665
Speaker 0: I mean think if we haven't seen not like I don't know where it goes I don't know if it has like an explicit end, but it's like it's got a They had in order to make that like, you know excusable.

457
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,890
Speaker 1: they got across that line.

458
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:38,574
Speaker 1: Okay, I will give you the credit now that you you know, set it out loud But if you just sort of keep it on the down-low You're basically, you know, just leaving it for male gaziness and I can't give you credit just for pretending or alluding to Right some Yuri.

459
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:42,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta give me you gotta actually give Yuri or you don't get credit for it.

460
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:44,530
Speaker 0: So there seems to also be an undercurrent.

461
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,921
Speaker 0: I'm looking at kind of what's coming up down the show and also I guess it was better There's some manga that I can look at.

462
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:50,250
Speaker 0: I'm sure there see where it's going.

463
00:26:50,753 --> 00:26:55,737
Speaker 0: It seems like there is actually a plot around dragons Hiding the dragon world.

464
00:26:55,757 --> 00:26:59,450
Speaker 0: There's some sort of war among the dragons and some nonsense going on.

465
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:03,070
Speaker 0: So bit by bit these dragons get attracted here, but it might go somewhere.

466
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:05,820
Speaker 1: Thank you for mentioning the best part of this show.

467
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,290
Speaker 1: much like fancy Lala which has a plot about dinosaurs Dragon maid has a plot about dragons.

468
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:23,288
Speaker 1: They alert to it showing you that like when the dragon met the maid like she was dying Sort of like Excalibur this big-ass awesome sword stabbed in her and she was wounded and she got healed.

469
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:25,215
Speaker 1: and she doesn't want to Go back to the dragon world.

470
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:28,469
Speaker 1: and the dragon world is fully humans, you know magic and fight with dragons and dude.

471
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:30,870
Speaker 1: Why did you make this garbage show?

472
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,167
Speaker 1: You could have just given me a show about that dragon world a fantasy show and cut out all this maid bullshit.

473
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:42,423
Speaker 0: if season two were the Dragons come and fuck up this world or You just give me the oh, I'll go back to the other world.

474
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:43,971
Speaker 1: It's like.

475
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:51,420
Speaker 1: all I care about is the stuff happening in the fantasy world with the Wizards the Knights and the actual Dragon form dragons breathing fire on them.

476
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:55,194
Speaker 1: if that was 90% of the show I would watch that.

477
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:59,490
Speaker 1: but it's only like 1% of this show and that's the part that's like.

478
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,481
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like just give me tidbits of the good stuff.

479
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:02,902
Speaker 1: Yep.

480
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:06,730
Speaker 1: It's like someone else is watching the show thinking Oh, man, the boobs are the good stuff.

481
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:13,517
Speaker 1: No I don't care about that sword business and that's a person who I should take a sword to Get you an anime that can do both.

482
00:28:13,537 --> 00:28:15,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this doesn't do both.

483
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:17,590
Speaker 1: It just pretends to do what right?

484
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,970
Speaker 1: It's like if it did even half the show was about the other dragon world.

485
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:21,988
Speaker 1: Yeah I'd be down.

486
00:28:22,491 --> 00:28:27,105
Speaker 1: But it's like you get one second if you're lucky of other dragon world in each episode.

487
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:29,736
Speaker 1: now on the other hand that does and I don't Got I don't got time for that.

488
00:28:29,797 --> 00:28:31,890
Speaker 1: I could just watch an actual fantasy anime.

489
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:36,267
Speaker 0: Well like dragon half if you if you want dragon girl, I guess layers again.

490
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:38,737
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, you've never seen the slayers.

491
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:39,861
Speaker 0: that actually has dragons in it.

492
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:42,250
Speaker 1: I could I could watch that instead of dragon.

493
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:43,490
Speaker 1: Actually, I'll be a great choice.

494
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:45,056
Speaker 0: We should cuz you me and Emily cuz.

495
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:47,607
Speaker 0: you guys had never seen slayers next and remember.

496
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:48,270
Speaker 0: so we watched it.

497
00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:52,049
Speaker 0: I've got all of Laura's DVDs still of slayers try which is the next season.

498
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:53,133
Speaker 1: Let's watch that.

499
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:56,703
Speaker 0: then you know, the plot is dragon slave the plot of slayers.

500
00:28:56,764 --> 00:28:58,489
Speaker 1: try it kind of like what I try to do.

501
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:08,630
Speaker 0: Uh, so you find out that for all of slayers up to this point the world they're in There's an edge to it and it seems like it's been surrounded by this magic shield.

502
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,010
Speaker 0: No one can get in or out and the shield suddenly disappears and people fall off the edge.

503
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,250
Speaker 0: Nope, so Lena and all them are like let's fucking go out there in a boat and see what's out there.

504
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,394
Speaker 1: Oh, it's water outside.

505
00:29:18,414 --> 00:29:19,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what's out there?

506
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:20,500
Speaker 1: more land.

507
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:23,510
Speaker 0: Nobody knows magic and everyone's wet mad week.

508
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:27,524
Speaker 0: Okay, so they're like super powerful and there's dragon plots and stuff.

509
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,970
Speaker 1: No, but the dragons out there.

510
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:31,481
Speaker 0: Well, there are two dragons who are just in the party.

511
00:29:32,024 --> 00:29:32,546
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

512
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:34,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Do.

513
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:46,824
Speaker 0: I do also like how God she's kind of just like Toru is just kind of like big and fat and like weird Dragon derp with her magic powers the business almost gooster.

514
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,349
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I'm talking about mr.

515
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:48,510
Speaker 0: Coby.

516
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:50,144
Speaker 0: I went back to Kobayashi's dragon maid.

517
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:53,743
Speaker 1: Oh, that's Layers that show can use some summer goose.

518
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:58,106
Speaker 0: They're also kind of Derpy and bubbling bulbous in some sense.

519
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:00,558
Speaker 0: All right No, we will do that's lovely.

520
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,281
Speaker 0: the next big show.

521
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:02,487
Speaker 0: watch watch us let's try.

522
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:04,616
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm We'll do a review of it at some point.

523
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:12,873
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but I guess think that what makes this show Tolerable is that the joke isn't just oh my god She's a dragon.

524
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:16,170
Speaker 0: it gets a little like it keeps changing up a little bit.

525
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,731
Speaker 0: it usually seems to center around like like remember when they go to the park to play and It turned.

526
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:28,617
Speaker 0: basically they're shocked that she doesn't have any powers and they really really overestimate humans at every step of the way Mm-hmm.

527
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:35,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a cute light-hearted show about dragon girls and some other character.

528
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:36,391
Speaker 0: Let's see There's.

529
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:38,499
Speaker 1: it's not an anime to run screaming from.

530
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,650
Speaker 1: it's an anime to watch if you like this sort of thing Or if you've already watched all the other animes and you want to watch another anime.

531
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:51,210
Speaker 0: It's like a light-hearted thing to watch while you're eating dinner, but it's not something you're gonna shotgun through like Gundam seed.

532
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:52,113
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

533
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:53,899
Speaker 1: I don't need to watch more than the five episodes.

534
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,722
Speaker 1: I already watched like.

535
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:55,966
Speaker 0: here's a picture of tours father.

536
00:30:55,986 --> 00:31:03,843
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, goblin a bunch of monsters Catch the kawaddle.

537
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,381
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Don't know if exactly where the show goes.

538
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:10,677
Speaker 0: I just know that according to the manga I don't care other than the higher plot.

539
00:31:10,817 --> 00:31:12,102
Speaker 1: Just tell me what the actual plot is.

540
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:12,885
Speaker 1: I don't need to watch this.

541
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:16,408
Speaker 0: something about chaos Dragons as far as I can tell.

542
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:17,835
Speaker 1: Why is it too?

543
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,200
Speaker 1: It should be way simpler than that.

544
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,207
Speaker 0: I think there's two dragon factions.

545
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:21,930
Speaker 1: Okay?

546
00:31:22,951 --> 00:31:23,453
Speaker 0: That's all I know.

547
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:24,757
Speaker 0: there are two dragon factions.

548
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:27,105
Speaker 1: all the dragons we've met so far are in the same faction.

549
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:27,507
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

550
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:33,885
Speaker 0: No, so Elma belongs to the order faction the rival to toru's chaos faction.

551
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:41,345
Speaker 0: Elma's the kid one, uh Snow kana is the kid one.

552
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:44,715
Speaker 0: Okay You've already lost all the hair.

553
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:45,538
Speaker 1: I don't care.

554
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:47,064
Speaker 0: You don't care.

555
00:31:47,084 --> 00:31:47,546
