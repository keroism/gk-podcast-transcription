00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:20,629
Speaker 0: mama hosted us the boy and the beast beasts.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,063
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:27,256
Speaker 0: and Yeah, TLDR version.

8
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:30,250
Speaker 0: We're gonna tell you to go see it, but the review will get into more detail.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,345
Speaker 1: I guess what if we ever said for an anime movie don't go see it.

10
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:41,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the anime movies We'd tell you not to go see are the ones that we either didn't watch or we don't talk about or we're not gonna watch.

11
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:45,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, there aren't that many bad anime movies that I've seen?

12
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:46,053
Speaker 0: well I guess there are.

13
00:00:46,073 --> 00:00:46,757
Speaker 0: I mean we never did.

14
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:49,090
Speaker 0: we never did like Armageddon or do Megalopolis.

15
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:52,621
Speaker 1: I guess I won't necessarily tell you not to watch.

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:01:02,294
Speaker 0: actually I was talking to multiple people about Both of those anime recently and in all these conversations the end result was basically It's kind of like apocalypse.

17
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:05,966
Speaker 0: zero may not be the greatest thing, but it's worth seeing it.

18
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:07,130
Speaker 1: for reasons?

19
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:14,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, not not because reasons is boy in the V's exactly But yeah, so it's crazy warm out and it's biking season.

20
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:16,215
Speaker 0: finally I think I'd like to work tomorrow.

21
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:21,054
Speaker 1: I'm in a new office or the biking situation is not fixed yet But my boss.

22
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,365
Speaker 1: boss was like I'm gonna take a project and fix that.

23
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,392
Speaker 1: so I guess I got to wait for the old bikes And building.

24
00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:28,761
Speaker 0: yeah, my old company kept saying that they never fixed it.

25
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:35,010
Speaker 1: well apparently this building used to have a bike Rack in the basement, but it's under construction now and like renovating and shit.

26
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:38,910
Speaker 1: So I is when it finishes that might resolve.

27
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,861
Speaker 1: But my co-worker who bikes he put his.

28
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:42,370
Speaker 1: he tied his bike up outside the off.

29
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:48,705
Speaker 0: I would do that if my company gave me in writing Something that said they will buy me a brand new bike of equivalent quality.

30
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,609
Speaker 0: if my bike gets stolen Any number of times if it's stolen while I'm working so?

31
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:57,190
Speaker 1: But when we just I just left the office with him I was in the elevator.

32
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,854
Speaker 1: We walked out.

33
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:58,619
Speaker 1: his bike was gone.

34
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,290
Speaker 1: his bike was right there in front of the building.

35
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:04,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I locked my bike up in Manhattan like 50 or 60 times before that one day.

36
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:10,318
Speaker 1: It was gone, so Goodbye a Easier to carry lock.

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,569
Speaker 1: the lock I have is like way big.

38
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,493
Speaker 0: yeah I know I have.

39
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,952
Speaker 0: I have one like pretty big lock and I have one crazy lock that I use like when I go to Brooklyn.

40
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:17,575
Speaker 1: yeah, I'll go buy.

41
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:20,209
Speaker 1: I should buy like a normal size one with the cable attached to it.

42
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:21,796
Speaker 0: So anyway, I got.

43
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:22,519
Speaker 0: I got some news.

44
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:23,865
Speaker 0: It's an animated movie.

45
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:28,328
Speaker 0: because I'm not reviewing it now But I'm gonna geek bite it briefly up in the patreon.

46
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,915
Speaker 0: Emily And I are gonna do in the room.

47
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:38,301
Speaker 0: Lee reviews a full review of it this weekend, but Zootopia Probably the best Disney movie in 20 years and 20 years.

48
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:40,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, let me see what's happened.

49
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:48,402
Speaker 1: 20 years ago was 96. yeah, you're gonna go like when did Lion King Aladdin come?

50
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:50,167
Speaker 0: uh when did they come out?

51
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:51,250
Speaker 0: probably before then?

52
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,399
Speaker 0: I've lost track of all that Yep, so uh you know what.

53
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:58,944
Speaker 0: yeah better than line.

54
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:01,312
Speaker 1: Aladdin was 92.

55
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:02,497
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right all right.

56
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,705
Speaker 0: so Lion King Aladdin are beyond the horizon.

57
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,236
Speaker 1: a Disney movie since 96.

58
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:08,629
Speaker 0: Aladdin and the Lion King.

59
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:09,713
Speaker 0: Let's see here.

60
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:13,626
Speaker 0: I get a list of every Disney movie, so let's see 95.

61
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,235
Speaker 0: Toy Story was 95 That's not 96.

62
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:17,661
Speaker 0: Yeah, 96.

63
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:18,664
Speaker 0: James the giant peach.

64
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:22,332
Speaker 0: no the hunchback of Notre Dame Hercules.

65
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:23,115
Speaker 1: well I mean you got.

66
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:25,984
Speaker 1: if you're Hercules you got to go to a story to Toy Story 3.

67
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:27,067
Speaker 0: all right all right.

68
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:31,441
Speaker 1: Toy Story 2 All those others all those other Pixar movies Dinosaur.

69
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,570
Speaker 0: oh So I really like the Emperor's New Groove.

70
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,321
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that movies overrated.

71
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:43,140
Speaker 0: I think it's the best Disney movie other than Zootopia in that era.

72
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,846
Speaker 0: what about that?

73
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:47,252
Speaker 0: may be like Toy Story 2 3.

74
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:48,462
Speaker 0: Lilo & Stitch was super good.

75
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:53,302
Speaker 0: all right Might be better than Lilo & Stitch by a tiny hair.

76
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:55,650
Speaker 0: get it anyway.

77
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:58,045
Speaker 1: What else is down there?

78
00:03:59,410 --> 00:03:59,812
Speaker 0: Tales of Earth?

79
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,219
Speaker 0: oh, that's just yeah tales of Earth.

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,069
Speaker 0: the Ghibli so Tangled was really good.

81
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:06,941
Speaker 0: Yeah, Mars Needs Moms not not gonna.

82
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:08,445
Speaker 0: Brave is pretty good.

83
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,030
Speaker 0: Wreck-It Ralph is pretty good.

84
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:11,403
Speaker 0: Frozen was okay.

85
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:15,616
Speaker 0: I Actually almost why.

86
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,110
Speaker 0: well, I guess this is also mixing Pixar and Walt Disney Studios.

87
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,558
Speaker 1: Well, I mean isn't Zootopia Pixar movie.

88
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,587
Speaker 0: No everyone keeps saying that it's not okay.

89
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:25,470
Speaker 1: That's interesting.

90
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:29,724
Speaker 1: It's a Disney Studios movie, so why is it all CG and not all 2d.

91
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:32,572
Speaker 0: It's animated all right In fact.

92
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:38,696
Speaker 0: uh you were I think 90% of the people I've talked to about this movie assumed It was Pixar incorrectly.

93
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:42,470
Speaker 1: what other CG movies has Disney made that weren't Pixar?

94
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:45,969
Speaker 0: Emily's shouting from the other room correcting Scott heavily, but I digress.

95
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:52,665
Speaker 0: Zootopia is Crazy good, and I would not say that lightly because I go into movies like this.

96
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:53,267
Speaker 1: It was funny.

97
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:57,742
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Then you know there's always the worry if a trailer is pretty good like that.

98
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,430
Speaker 0: like will the movie be as good?

99
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,457
Speaker 1: Usually you put your best joke in the trailer.

100
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:03,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, the movie did far from that.

101
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:08,140
Speaker 0: so Zootopia Exceeded my expectations in a way that I can.

102
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:15,866
Speaker 0: I can name very few movies that have ever actually Legitimately exceeded my expectations to that degree and I already came in with pretty high ones.

103
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:26,337
Speaker 0: so What I'll say is that it deals with issues of discrimination very pointedly and in a Surprisingly elegant and nuanced way.

104
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:32,795
Speaker 0: I am deeply impressed with this movie and all I'm gonna say is that you should definitely go see it If you haven't seen it already.

105
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:36,330
Speaker 0: also it appears to be on track to break some box-office records.

106
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:38,230
Speaker 0: It's going crazy in the theater.

107
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:44,107
Speaker 1: Well there haven't been you know a movie that got the kids out to the theater since like frozen me so

108
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:53,396
Speaker 0: so Funny when we were at the theater the audience was about a third families with kids on a Sunday like evening show And the rest of it

109
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,180
Speaker 1: was em furries.

110
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, the rest of it was all adults like us, right?

111
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,230
Speaker 1: I mean you know that's what's happening these days.

112
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:05,133
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like a movie is gonna get the most people in cuz you get the families and the nerds like yeah A good dichotomy.

113
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:08,570
Speaker 0: you'll see is there's those equestria girls movies that sometimes are in theaters.

114
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,609
Speaker 0: That's pretty much all little kids.

115
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:18,104
Speaker 0: But when the right the actual My Little Pony feature film comes out pretty sure whenever I go to see it It's gonna be mostly people around my age in that theater.

116
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:18,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll go see that.

117
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:23,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually based on gonna see in the theater the whole getting DVD.

118
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:33,219
Speaker 0: Oh I might see in the theater just because I want to see it early cuz you know weebs are gonna ruin it By telling me everything about it, how's that gonna ruin it?

119
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:36,690
Speaker 0: uh yeah, you have your weird spoiler opinion that I still disagree with.

120
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:42,082
Speaker 0: I'm not saying spoilers are the biggest deal in the world, but you take a Somewhat narrow view of it.

121
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:43,532
Speaker 0: anyway Go see.

122
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:47,509
Speaker 1: something can be ruined by learning information, but it was not good in the first place.

123
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:48,921
Speaker 0: no But the experience is different.

124
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:55,090
Speaker 0: the second time you see movie Someone better when you know more now why not see it twice, and then you get both experiences.

125
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:58,453
Speaker 1: They are both different because the first I could just learn everything about it And then see it.

126
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:01,169
Speaker 1: it'll be a great experience, and I only had to pay waste my time once.

127
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:05,162
Speaker 0: Uh I guess if wasting your time is how you treat watching movies.

128
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:06,527
Speaker 0: then go nuts anyway.

129
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:07,390
Speaker 0: go see Zootopia.

130
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:11,270
Speaker 0: It is utterly fantastic and nuanced to a degree that I did not expect.

131
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:11,711
Speaker 1: It's like.

132
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:15,020
Speaker 1: it's like if a food is delicious right is it?

133
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:18,129
Speaker 1: is it not delicious the first time and the second time is different.

134
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:22,850
Speaker 0: God there are very few movies that I watch more than three or four times.

135
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:25,528
Speaker 0: But I eat ice cream hundreds and hundreds of times in my life.

136
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,135
Speaker 1: Huh was it?

137
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:29,409
Speaker 1: was the ice cream spoiled that the second time you ate it.

138
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:33,286
Speaker 0: It was very as a different experience because the first time I had never experienced that before.

139
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:36,420
Speaker 1: so there's Delicious the second time.

140
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,305
Speaker 0: I don't have a tongue orgasm the hundreds time I ate ice cream But I probably had one the first time.

141
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,660
Speaker 1: no I'm pretty sure a tongue orgasm every time.

142
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,908
Speaker 0: I still disagree with you.

143
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,274
Speaker 0: anyway Do you have any news?

144
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:49,491
Speaker 0: since you're the reason we have to review Zootopia on the patreon is cuz you're probably not gonna see It.

145
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:52,364
Speaker 1: why would I go to the movie theater to see that you don't see any movies anymore.

146
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:53,810
Speaker 1: I see a lot of movies.

147
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,936
Speaker 1: I watched every Zatoichi.

148
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:57,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, you watch a lot of 26 movies to your one movie.

149
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,657
Speaker 0: Well, then maybe you should do a patreon and review them all.

150
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:04,935
Speaker 1: maybe I shouldn't because no it's not worth paying money for But you can watch all.

151
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:08,110
Speaker 1: you can watch all the Zatoichi movies on Hulu for zero dollars.

152
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:08,788
Speaker 1: You should do that.

153
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:12,990
Speaker 0: I'm curious how many of you would pay a dollar to listen to Scott review all the Zatoichi movies.

154
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:14,335
Speaker 1: Stupid people.

155
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:18,007
Speaker 1: All right, if you've got a dollar for that, you should just invest the dollar.

156
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:25,230
Speaker 0: There's a website I went to today that's got a dollar will make you rounding zero dollars over your entire life.

157
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,033
Speaker 1: That is correct ever.

158
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:32,797
Speaker 1: I went to a website today that said if you invested a dollar every day of your life How much would you have invested?

159
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,870
Speaker 1: because how many days have you lived and how much would that be now?

160
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:41,389
Speaker 1: And if I had done that I would have spent like twelve thousand dollars and I would have about fifty five thousand dollars right now.

161
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:45,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, but about dollar that's just like thirty bucks a month.

162
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,169
Speaker 0: That's what most people are putting away into like their 401ks because I don't have a lot of money.

163
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,190
Speaker 1: I'm putting a lot more than thirty dollars.

164
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:57,536
Speaker 0: Most people are putting any maximum Maximum allowed percentage.

165
00:08:57,857 --> 00:09:00,930
Speaker 0: Anyway, do you have any animation or comic news?

166
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,625
Speaker 1: Yes, the speaking of Hulu where you can watch all 26 25 Zatoichi movies.

167
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:14,983
Speaker 1: You can also watch best they put it on there like less than a week ago all 25 or 26 episodes of Azumanga die.

168
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:21,175
Speaker 1: Oh, you know again, I watched two episodes and That show is still good.

169
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:21,838
Speaker 1: But you know what?

170
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:27,025
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird because compared to my memory It's the exact same show except for two things.

171
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:44,830
Speaker 1: number one Something being in a non widescreen aspect ratio and like 480 not non widescreen is a lot like laugh tracks now Not P at all and some of the drawings are not that they looked really good back then But now it's like there's some definitely bad drawing.

172
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:49,086
Speaker 0: I had that problem the other day when you know Cuz the new Powerpuff Girls is coming and I watched one of the shorts they did.

173
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:49,610
Speaker 0: it was great.

174
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:53,290
Speaker 0: So I went back and watched one of my favorite old episodes of the Powerpuff Girls.

175
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,609
Speaker 0: It was good, but it was weird to see something so low-res and in a square effectively.

176
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:05,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, by the way in the new Powerpuff Girls trailer You know, it is confirmed.

177
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:09,673
Speaker 1: the most important thing that makes me know that shows gonna be good as good as the old one At least is that.

178
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,242
Speaker 0: yeah, of course him was there.

179
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,730
Speaker 0: him is the best part of the Powerpuff Girls.

180
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,834
Speaker 1: I wasn't sure they were gonna keep him.

181
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:22,154
Speaker 0: Well, the second best part the best part is that the professor's kind of a doofus Him is still in.

182
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what we need to know.

183
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:30,750
Speaker 1: Oh, so yeah, the other thing about Azumanga die Besides the square shape is that that show is really disjointed.

184
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:37,943
Speaker 1: I mean it was always based on like yeah the four panel comics, but it's like The episodes just like all way more.

185
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:41,399
Speaker 1: there were always all over the place But they're even more all over the place than I remember.

186
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:43,970
Speaker 0: I guess that's kind of what I remember and expected.

187
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,836
Speaker 1: Of course, I have also.

188
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:46,941
Speaker 1: everything else is still true.

189
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,267
Speaker 1: Like the drunk teachers the best.

190
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:50,516
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh, it's like I with that knife.

191
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:53,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, or when she's in the bathroom constantly.

192
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:55,215
Speaker 1: Oh my god I just remember that.

193
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:55,998
Speaker 1: get it together.

194
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:57,183
Speaker 1: I just remember the screensaver.

195
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:02,027
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Was like I'm walking around the CG room doing stuff.

196
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:06,090
Speaker 0: Yeah We had that on both our computers in our IT for a long time.

197
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:07,814
Speaker 0: Good days.

198
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:09,103
Speaker 1: Maybe I can find that and run it.

199
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:10,550
Speaker 1: Will it run on Windows 10?

200
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:16,585
Speaker 0: I think the other reason that I'm not surprised by the disjointedness or I guess like I wouldn't I don't think that would be Something that I would have forgotten and then go.

201
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:22,650
Speaker 0: Oh, right Is that I basically watched all of Nichijou which does the same thing and I also really like Nichijou.

202
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,694
Speaker 0: It's kind of in the same genre.

203
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:27,930
Speaker 1: I only watched like two episodes of Nichijou and I didn't see any goats getting somersault.

204
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:30,099
Speaker 0: You should watch all of Nichijou.

205
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:33,172
Speaker 1: I couldn't even tell what was going on in the two episodes I watched.

206
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:36,081
Speaker 0: there are pretty straightforward short narratives.

207
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:38,750
Speaker 1: It's usually something like I don't like introduce the characters though.

208
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:39,718
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm just like.

209
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,929
Speaker 1: I'm just like who the hell is this?

210
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,940
Speaker 0: Star Wars did such a great job of introducing all the characters.

211
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,038
Speaker 1: Azumanga Daioh does a good job of introducing the characters Because it has more of a very hard.

212
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:54,430
Speaker 1: the very first scene is they show after the teacher You know crashes or drops your chain off her bike and they get to the classroom.

213
00:11:54,811 --> 00:12:05,746
Speaker 1: They show you each person and show you their name on the screen and it's like Tomo-chan the crazy You know Genius, you know prodigy.

214
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,310
Speaker 1: in GeoChat.

215
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:08,515
Speaker 1: They tell you each person is.

216
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:12,484
Speaker 1: and then the second episode is just an introduction of Osaka.

217
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:22,520
Speaker 1: The whole second episode is Osaka omen Things of the day.

218
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:28,880
Speaker 0: Emily found this last night and it's that's good because she's better fun things really really really good.

219
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:31,532
Speaker 0: So red line was an amazing movie.

220
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:33,080
Speaker 0: We reviewed on geek night some time ago.

221
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,724
Speaker 0: It's not my favorite anime movies Like the more I think about it.

222
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:39,038
Speaker 0: pretty good just it's that kind of weird movie that I like.

223
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:39,620
Speaker 0: that is not.

224
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,624
Speaker 1: I only watched it once.

225
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:43,717
Speaker 1: I feel like I should watch it one more time because I can.

226
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:44,540
Speaker 0: it's why it's a movie.

227
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,799
Speaker 0: I feel like I could watch matrix level number of times and never get tired of it.

228
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,106
Speaker 1: I don't know if I watch it that many times.

229
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:49,911
Speaker 1: think I could.

230
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:51,299
Speaker 1: I should watch the matrix and I go.

231
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:58,313
Speaker 1: So this is an AMV to Red line isn't it the whole thing on AMV to begin with?

232
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,200
Speaker 1: is it really necessary to make AMV out of it?

233
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,959
Speaker 0: Well, this AMV does a very good job.

234
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:02,383
Speaker 0: 5 5 5 AMV.

235
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:08,220
Speaker 0: There's two fundamental kinds of AMVs on this level.

236
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:19,152
Speaker 0: There's the AMV that just takes the aesthetic of a show and does something with it And there's an AMV that retells the show or retells the movie With the backdrop of music almost like a summary.

237
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:20,920
Speaker 0: This is more like the latter kind.

238
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:26,304
Speaker 0: So if you've never seen red line go watch red line first Then watch this AMV.

239
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:30,034
Speaker 0: It's one of those AMVs that reminds you how fucking amazing red line is.

240
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, just watch Oh, baby, baby.

241
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:39,307
Speaker 0: Yeah Because that actually doesn't really spoil anything significant about utana Even if it does.

242
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:42,060
Speaker 1: but you wouldn't understand like you wouldn't know what the fuck you're seeing.

243
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:56,285
Speaker 1: It's more like it hints at whoa The show goes way off the rails down the road and also it's got you know, some Sega Saturn actions Like you see someone fighting and like they're gonna duel and they might not not anyway, the Thing of the day, right?

244
00:13:56,305 --> 00:14:00,339
Speaker 1: So someone made this funny video cowboy beep boop beep boop beep boop.

245
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:12,280
Speaker 1: It's a little funny kind of like retelling of an early episode of cowboy bebop the one with the ventriloquist dummy That's like alive but as a person but isn't or whatever, you know, they're the kid who looks like one but it's young.

246
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:13,825
Speaker 1: You should see that episode.

247
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:17,277
Speaker 1: It's actually one of the I think not as good episodes a cowboy bebop.

248
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:18,000
Speaker 0: I would agree with that.

249
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:24,456
Speaker 1: But here I mean not that you know, even the worst episode of cowboy bebop is great Like other people don't like the chess one.

250
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:24,860
Speaker 1: I like that.

251
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,640
Speaker 0: Well, it has the problem of that.

252
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,658
Speaker 0: It's in that Twilight Zone between the first episode and the fifth episode that everyone goes.

253
00:14:31,678 --> 00:14:34,960
Speaker 0: Oh shit It's in the Twilight Zone between cowboy bebop and Batman.

254
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:46,768
Speaker 1: But yeah So but someone retells that episode in like a few seconds with this quirky little not even animation like Animatic almost just some pencil drawings and some voiceover.

255
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:49,475
Speaker 1: good and it's still way funny.

256
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,340
Speaker 1: It's like it's like a gift plus plus.

257
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:56,685
Speaker 1: It's worth your 10 seconds of time Beep-boop in the meta moment.

258
00:14:57,027 --> 00:15:00,218
Speaker 0: The book club book is probably gonna be Oryx and Craig Margaret Atwood.

259
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:00,880
Speaker 0: So stay tuned.

260
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,188
Speaker 0: I haven't announced it yet.

261
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:02,973
Speaker 1: Yeah, no good ideas.

262
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:03,316
Speaker 1: You're on your.

263
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:03,980
Speaker 1: still my ideas.

264
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,819
Speaker 0: I got that idea from Emily and Adam and Kate not from you.

265
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,418
Speaker 1: I got the idea cuz I kept hearing Margaret at was named like a hundred times.

266
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:16,145
Speaker 1: Yeah Adam and Kate more people than that But yes them also else.

267
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:21,964
Speaker 0: name one other human being who brought that book up something on internet such as someone Some guy in the internet.

268
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:23,130
Speaker 1: I saw some tweets or something.

269
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,140
Speaker 1: Plus there was that video where she was a hockey goalie.

270
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:28,255
Speaker 0: No, yeah, which was my thing of the day.

271
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:28,858
Speaker 1: It's fine.

272
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:29,360
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter?

273
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,780
Speaker 1: I kept hearing it a bunch and I said, all right next book club book.

274
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:35,586
Speaker 1: I get I'm picking one of your books and then you come in Picking one her books.

275
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:37,779
Speaker 1: now, I got to find something else like a different one of her books.

276
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:39,871
Speaker 1: We're not doing the same author twice in a row.

277
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:40,233
Speaker 0: Why not?

278
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:41,198
Speaker 1: That's not allowed.

279
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:41,440
Speaker 0: Why not?

280
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:41,962
Speaker 0: I'll just do.

281
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,769
Speaker 0: I'll just do every Prince of Nothing book one by one.

282
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:49,453
Speaker 1: No, we got spread some love love must be spread But I haven't announced it officially.

283
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:50,600
Speaker 1: she doesn't deserve two picks.

284
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:56,000
Speaker 0: I'm saying no one deserved two picks cuz I kind of started the 11th book of the Wheel of Time.

285
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,873
Speaker 0: I'm finding out more about what Randall tour is up to.

286
00:15:58,893 --> 00:15:59,556
Speaker 0: I get spoilers.

287
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:00,320
Speaker 0: He's still alive.

288
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:05,714
Speaker 1: You don't say yeah The main character lives to all the books and you only can die in the last one.

289
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:07,380
Speaker 0: actually is anyone know?

290
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,569
Speaker 0: So I'm so I haven't read the end.

291
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,216
Speaker 0: So this is not a spoiler.

292
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,291
Speaker 1: if you're a main character You can't die until the end of the book at the final book.

293
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,034
Speaker 1: That's how things work.

294
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:17,175
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, you can Really?

295
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,863
Speaker 1: Okay, so That's dead is what you're saying.

296
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:24,776
Speaker 0: It's not a spoiler because well, he died and then came back.

297
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:26,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a shame.

Speaker 0: And actually I watched it cuz I had to edit it.

363
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:16,404
Speaker 0: It's pretty good panel.

364
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:17,808
Speaker 0: Like we do a job.

365
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,032

00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:19,494
Speaker 0: It's in the.

367
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:20,738
Speaker 0: it's in the top 10 panels.

368
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:26,853
Speaker 0: We did a better job of it at magfest though Yeah, and I think we didn't record it there because we're like every video did.

369
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:27,455
Speaker 0: who cares?

370
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:28,900
Speaker 1: I was just too lazy.

371
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,755

372
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:32,439
Speaker 0: you can watch it.

373
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:34,467
Speaker 1: There's no point in posting the same panel twice.

374
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:37,779
Speaker 0: I posted the same panel twice a few times if we've crooked enough.

375
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,216
Speaker 1: Yeah, make it time.

376
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:46,900
Speaker 0: Beyond D&D is up twice because it evolved a lot between those early times and when we did it at PAX OS.

Speaker 1: if we didn't I cuz I don't think I've seen it.

386
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,389

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,296
Speaker 0: yeah, there was wolf children.

Speaker 1: I didn't see that one either.

391
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:28,530
Speaker 0: You didn't see wolf children now, and then we saw summer wars Which was three years before Wolf children.

392
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:33,032
Speaker 1: Yeah, and What else did he do besides bullying the Beast which we're talking about today?

393
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:34,558
Speaker 0: Uh, one piece Baron.

394
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:37,165

Speaker 1: we reviewed that.

396
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:42,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think he did the the anime opening samurai shampoo.

397
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,744
Speaker 0: He did something with the opening.

398
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,490
Speaker 1: I mean that doesn't.

399
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,815
Speaker 1: I'm talking about like movies.

400
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:47,256
Speaker 1: He's made.

401
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:47,919
Speaker 1: He's a movie guy.

402
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:52,675
Speaker 1: now Come to New York because he's already working on another movie.

403
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:53,700
Speaker 1: He's like cranking him out.

404
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:59,426
Speaker 0: Well Scott, if you're talking movies, the only other thing really in there is that super flat modding at REM Which isn't really a movie.

405
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,780
Speaker 1: just know it's not really okay, so that's all his movies.

406
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,044
Speaker 1: So his new movie is the.

407
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:05,392
Speaker 1: that's out is the boy and the Beast.

408
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:07,560
Speaker 1: you can see in theaters in the US now.

409
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:13,040
Speaker 0: Every one of his movies has been on a trajectory of increasingly furry and the trend has continued.

410
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:15,026
Speaker 0: Girl at their time zero.

411
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:19,779
Speaker 0: He is some wars the girls of kitsune in the in the magic space wolf children.

412
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:21,952
Speaker 0: Yep, boy and the Beast.

413
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:25,048
Speaker 1: Yep What was this wasn't his movie?

414
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:26,012
Speaker 1: What was that movie?

415
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:38,127
Speaker 1: It was like a fantasy Furries but not you know perverted ones and it was like that ballerina animal and there was like an adventure thing You're thinking of.

416
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,495
Speaker 1: I'm not imagining this right.

417
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:41,258
Speaker 0: No, you're.

418
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:45,439
Speaker 1: I Think it was one of those ones where someone goes to another world.

419
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:48,044
Speaker 0: Why story?

420
00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:48,887
Speaker 1: oh, yeah.

421
00:21:48,947 --> 00:21:51,857
Speaker 1: Okay that one aspects of hostedness in it.

422
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:52,439
Speaker 1: Whoever made it?

423
00:21:53,101 --> 00:22:01,660
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah member host is batting a thousand in the sense that while not every movie He has made has been a home run then a thousand just means you hit every ball.

424
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:04,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like every movie you make is a really good movie.

425
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:05,297
Speaker 1: We're seeing.

426
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:07,948
Speaker 0: yep So the TLC are better than others.

427
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:10,437
Speaker 0: like we said, this is an anime movie.

428
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:11,400
Speaker 0: It came out recently.

429
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,709
Speaker 0: It's really good and you should definitely go see it.

430
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:16,320
Speaker 0: if you care at all about anime or animation.

431
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:25,880
Speaker 0: If you happen to like wolf children summer wars the girl who left through time You should really go see this movie because it is in his fashion like the kinds of things he's done before.

432
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:31,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like there's some people like Miyazaki or Satoshi khan where every time they get up to the plate home run.

433
00:22:31,823 --> 00:22:32,507
Speaker 1: Maru hosted it.

434
00:22:32,547 --> 00:22:37,792
Speaker 1: It's like every time he gets up to the plate he hits Sometimes home runs sometimes just double.

435
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:42,370
Speaker 0: I think Satoshi khan is the only Anime director to have literally only hit home runs.

436
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,072
Speaker 1: I think so.

437
00:22:43,132 --> 00:22:45,420
Speaker 1: Even Miyazaki is sometimes hit non-home run.

438
00:22:45,420 --> 00:23:00,227
Speaker 1: Well, you said Miyazaki which could include go And Tezuka is just the guy with so many at-bats that even though he strikes out sometimes his total numbers He's like how fast he's like.

439
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:01,453
Speaker 1: he's like Cal Ripken, right?

440
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:02,035
Speaker 1: He just goes.

441
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:03,040
Speaker 1: he just keeps playing.

442
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:11,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but yeah, so the Boy and the Beast is actually two hours long.

443
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:18,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this movie is like way long But on the one hand it's like you think something that's so long will get drawn out.

444
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:26,253
Speaker 1: But no, it's like the pacing was like the biggest thing I noticed and the first thing I thought of when it was over Because it keeps moving along.

445
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:27,800
Speaker 1: There's no point in which it drags.

446
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,227
Speaker 1: There was a part where I thought it was gonna like Yeah suddenly become.

447
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:41,525
Speaker 1: there's like this major point in the movie where it's like, okay Now we're going in a quest to visit all the Beast Kings and all the different Beast kingdoms, but BAM It was a montage.

448
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,333
Speaker 1: They just breezed right over that and I'm like, is that?

449
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:46,680
Speaker 0: and then my exactly like brave story.

450
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,360
Speaker 1: And at first I thought it was gonna just be a traveling montage.

451
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:57,939
Speaker 1: But no they montaged over every single right through all the Beast Kings and I'm like, whoa Now that is moving right along here.

452
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,320
Speaker 0: We'll avoid spoilers at least till the end because it's anime.

453
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:00,977
Speaker 0: We just go see it.

454
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:09,048
Speaker 0: But the one thing I will say is this movie the trailers and all the stuff I saw at this point Didn't really tell you shit about what it was about.

455
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:09,489
Speaker 1: No, I had.

456
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:13,060
Speaker 0: no I couldn't and that's a good thing because it covers some ground.

457
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:14,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, it goes.

458
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:21,851
Speaker 1: it's like it keeps moving along at this pace and where you're not dragging on any one part for too long right.

459
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:37,488
Speaker 1: and Just when I think this things like it's heading to the climax part like, you know 75% of the way through I didn't know how far we were in right, but it felt like okay Here's the climax the thing we've been waiting for since the beginning the battle to see who's gonna be the new You know Lord of the Beast Kingdom.

460
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:40,000
Speaker 1: here it is and I'm like, wait a minute.

461
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,320
Speaker 1: There's like this big thing that is an obvious foreshadow.

462
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,409
Speaker 1: There's a Chekhov's gun that hasn't fired.

463
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:48,140
Speaker 1: that has nothing to do with this Chekhov's well Moby Dick.

464
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:53,819
Speaker 1: yeah, there's a Chekhov's character who hasn't resolved their deal and it won't be resolved in this climax part.

465
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,398
Speaker 1: and This is being movies been going on for a long time

466
00:24:57,478 --> 00:25:04,435
Speaker 0: now unlike Well constructed movies that Chekhov's characters gun like the I'm like character almost

467
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:13,440
Speaker 1: felt like something that would be resolved in another Episode or another movie later and not this movie and I hadn't looked at a clock But it felt like it'd been going on so long.

468
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,579
Speaker 1: I'm like it's got to end now.

469
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:24,288
Speaker 1: but no that they kept going after that climax and fired that Chekhov's character and had the real the real climax after that and That character is one more act.

470
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:29,468
Speaker 0: a less well done movie would have had a lot more telegraphing of what that was all gonna be about.

471
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:34,448
Speaker 0: this one had a few context clues and Mostly it was.

472
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:35,537
Speaker 0: it was Chekhov's back.

473
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:43,200
Speaker 1: I don't know I don't know how many acts there were but at the end of the second to last act There was the climax and then the final act I didn't even know was gonna happen.

474
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,760
Speaker 0: I thought that second last act was the last one but like in a bad movie that was like the characters holding the gun.

475
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:54,000
Speaker 0: This was more like in Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf where the gun is on the mantle in the background.

476
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:57,697
Speaker 0: You can see it there, but no one's saying anything about it.

477
00:25:57,938 --> 00:26:01,268
Speaker 1: Yep Alright, so the deal with this movie this boy.

478
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:05,220
Speaker 1: and there's a beast and the beast is awesome beast.

479
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:06,726
Speaker 0: Okay, it's here.

480
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:08,092
Speaker 0: He's from the land of beasts.

481
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:13,287
Speaker 1: The Beast is basically Toshiro Mifune from Seven Samurai.

482
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:14,811
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

483
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:16,054
Speaker 1: Right?

484
00:26:16,295 --> 00:26:31,069
Speaker 1: Well then in mannerism in in Every aspect of this person Right and he's in the Beast Kingdom and he's competing to become the new Lord of the Beast Kingdom when they super awesome Current Lord of the Beast Kingdom is the best character.

485
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:32,252
Speaker 0: Oh my god that rabbit.

486
00:26:32,714 --> 00:26:34,439
Speaker 1: He's basically the grandma from summer wars.

487
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:44,438
Speaker 1: He's got to compete against the also awesome, but opposite personality got beast Who's like a sort of a bore, right?

488
00:26:44,498 --> 00:26:50,880
Speaker 0: Yeah Who is well a neat tidy organized a good person in every possible aspect?

489
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other Sam, you know the lead samurai in the seven Sam, right?

490
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forget his name, but he's a lot of Curaçao movies.

491
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,640
Speaker 1: But anyway, so they're gonna compete to become you know, the new Lord of the Beast Kingdom.

492
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,979
Speaker 0: But anyway, so independently next to all this is Tokyo Japan modern-day Japan and a kid runs away from home.

493
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:09,651
Speaker 1: Well, so the kid doesn't just run away from home, right?

494
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:10,616
Speaker 1: His parents are dead.

495
00:27:10,636 --> 00:27:19,626
Speaker 1: He's good He's living with like some step pair, you know some like mom's Parents or so his family's rich Sure, but he's a family.

496
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:21,334
Speaker 1: He doesn't like that doesn't like him right?

497
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:26,260
Speaker 1: It's almost a oh What the hell was that anime that's good, but then becomes perverted.

498
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:30,178
Speaker 1: What is it one with the that still doesn't narrow down.

499
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:35,037
Speaker 1: no He is the girl who's like grandpa's daughter and he adopts her.

500
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:36,703
Speaker 0: Oh We did.

501
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:39,513
Speaker 0: we reviewed it on anime Boston.

502
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,059
Speaker 0: Yeah in the end they sex.

503
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:44,491
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but that's in the manga and I stopped watching buddy.

504
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:45,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah bunny drop, right?

505
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:46,537
Speaker 1: It's like others.

506
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:47,200
Speaker 0: they sex.

507
00:27:47,441 --> 00:27:50,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a bunny drop situation without the sex part.

508
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:56,100
Speaker 1: Right only runs away from home instead of living with this family that doesn't really care about him that much.

509
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,380
Speaker 1: They they seem to want to take care of him.

510
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,880
Speaker 1: They're like, oh you'll be taken care of and whatever but doesn't seem like there's any love or caring in that relationship.

511
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:10,640
Speaker 0: right runs away and has a little bit of Personal drama around that in shades of perhaps nurse little Kayla Gwynn novel.

512
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:15,540
Speaker 0: So he stumbles into the Beast Kingdom and but it's just on the other side of an alley from Tokyo.

513
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:21,197
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the Beast Kingdom is a metaphorical kingdom, but it's also a totally literal Kingdom.

514
00:28:21,337 --> 00:28:22,260
Speaker 1: It's a literal place.

515
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,794
Speaker 0: Now that is actually literally my favorite part of this movie.

516
00:28:26,814 --> 00:28:28,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, you thought you could have easily done this.

517
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,125
Speaker 1: We're like, oh, it's a hallucination.

518
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:31,530
Speaker 1: Oh, it's it's.

519
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,320
Speaker 1: um, what's the movie with the guy in the boat with the tiger?

520
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,803
Speaker 0: Life up high.

521
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:39,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, where the whole thing's a metaphor and he wasn't really on a boat with a tiger, right?

522
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,140
Speaker 0: One could argue that he was sure right metaphorical.

523
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:57,753
Speaker 1: This is literally yes There is a Beast Kingdom and a real Tokyo of modern day and they both really exist for real and Hosanna goes out of his Way to make sure you cannot interpret this as anything.

524
00:28:57,814 --> 00:28:59,919
Speaker 0: but this is the literal reality.

525
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:06,824
Speaker 1: now You can't be like, oh the Beast Kingdom was just like a dream for like and it was a metaphor for the orphanage He was in or something.

526
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:07,085
Speaker 1: It's like.

527
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,371
Speaker 1: no there was a Beast Kingdom.

528
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:10,360
Speaker 1: He was raised by this beast, right?

529
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,139
Speaker 1: He was the beasts, uh, you know, what's it called?

530
00:29:14,081 --> 00:29:15,005
Speaker 1: Student student.

531
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:17,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're you're forgetting every written words tonight.

532
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:18,197
Speaker 1: Yeah words.

533
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:18,880
Speaker 1: It's warm out.

534
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:24,180
Speaker 1: I'm not thinking about being in here doing a podcast but instead of like it is literally the reality.

535
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,880
Speaker 0: But that literal reality of this animated world is itself heavy allegory.

536
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:31,580
Speaker 1: The word was a student is apprentice, right?

537
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:38,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Beast needs apprentices to like, you know become the Lord of beasts, which he wants to be for some reason.

538
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:39,900
Speaker 1: That's the one part that's confusing.

539
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:41,346
Speaker 1: Why does he want to be the Lord of beasts?

540
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:44,539
Speaker 0: you feel like he wants to be because he's expected to want to be.

541
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:46,327
Speaker 0: I think he doesn't want to get shown up.

542
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:49,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's mostly he just wants to fight the other guy and Wayne.

543
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:53,770
Speaker 1: I don't think he actually wants to be the Lord of the beats And no one else seems to want him to be either.

544
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,939
Speaker 1: The other guy would actually probably be a better Lord.

545
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:59,235
Speaker 0: The same time they're all kind of anyway, you know, it's interesting.

546
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:02,257
Speaker 0: the Beast world basically perfect.

547
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically like no one appears to want for anything.

548
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:08,637
Speaker 0: Everyone's happy all the time.

549
00:30:08,677 --> 00:30:11,088
Speaker 0: as far as you can tell It's almost a Miyazaki thing, right?

550
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:17,091
Speaker 1: We're like the place that is low-tech is And you know is all traditional is all happy and peaceful.

551
00:30:17,112 --> 00:30:19,098
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's sort of like a dr.

552
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:19,760
Speaker 1: Seuss thing, too.

553
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,205
Speaker 1: It's like oh, yeah the place with the factory that eats up all the tough of the trees is bad in the place You know same deal.

554
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,574
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time that's a magic.

555
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:29,080
Speaker 1: land is all happy and perfect life.

556
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:30,774
Speaker 1: And the human world has darkness.

557
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:38,840
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, well human cell phone because humans have darkness inherent in them and beasts do not have similar inherent darkness.

558
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,371
Speaker 1: But I guess the human world has light in the library.

559
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:47,850
Speaker 1: The library is a nice place in the human world Yeah, but it's hard to without because they're.

560
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:49,475
Speaker 0: this movie covers so much ground.

561
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:50,980
Speaker 0: you really should just see it.

562
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:53,363
Speaker 0: Yeah and I don't want to get into Why.

563
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:59,262
Speaker 0: it's important that the human world and the beast world are both literal realities and how that ties into Pretty much.

564
00:30:59,302 --> 00:31:12,299
Speaker 1: what you can expect from this movie is you know, the awesome sort of general apprentice Adventure kind of thing with you know, the you know, the apprentice being better than the master in some ways and whatnot?

565
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:18,580
Speaker 1: learning You know, but the mat the master while being goofy is also, you know wise in other ways, right?

566
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:24,060
Speaker 1: You know pretty typical expected sort of relationship there, you know growing up thing.

567
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:29,417
Speaker 1: But then once grown up, you know resolving of plots that were there.

568
00:31:29,497 --> 00:31:35,514
Speaker 1: since you know The beginning part it's like aha you actually it wasn't just the girl up.

569
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:36,617
Speaker 1: end of movie.

570
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:39,143
Speaker 1: you're grown up now Congratulations.

571
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:40,448
Speaker 1: It was you grew up.

572
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:43,540
Speaker 1: now you can do the quest and we have time so we're gonna fucking do it.

573
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:53,616
Speaker 0: Yeah so the movie is despite also being very serious and having very heavy allegory that Full disclosure might be a little too close to home for some people in the audience.

574
00:31:53,997 --> 00:32:00,630
Speaker 0: Oh It is also legitimately Outright hilarious at points.

575
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:02,320
Speaker 0: It is a really funny movie.

576
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:08,880
Speaker 1: Just and Bennett's the humor is and they don't stop the humor until that very final act right right up.

577
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,923
Speaker 1: But even that climax I talked about in the second to last act still has humors in it But it's clever like.

578
00:32:13,943 --> 00:32:19,100
Speaker 0: the humor reminds me actually of a lot of those Mufune type samurai movies that like that kind of humor.

579
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:20,144
Speaker 0: A lot of it is.

580
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:23,960
Speaker 1: well a lot of the humor comes from the monkey guy and the monk.

581
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:27,034
Speaker 0: Well, like there's the moment and he's like, what should I call you?

582
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:28,320
Speaker 0: Well, you're nine years old, right?

583
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,625
Speaker 0: I'll call you cute.

584
00:32:29,826 --> 00:32:30,890
Speaker 0: Ah, right you're not.

585
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:40,429
Speaker 1: and there's also these three sort of Like these guys that are sort of like these side characters way out like double side characters But they're basically the exact same characters.

586
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:42,256
Speaker 1: is the three old guys in cowboy beep-boop.

587
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:42,738
Speaker 0: Yep.

588
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:48,220
Speaker 1: Yep Okay, there's 100% and they provide some humor humorous interjections as well, right?

589
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:57,299
Speaker 0: But there's clever humor constantly and the Beast Lord is never not funny He's pretty much a hundred percent funny, I mean everyone's great I don't.

590
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,566
Speaker 0: Movie is just delightful.

591
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:01,053
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of humor in the human world.

592
00:33:01,154 --> 00:33:04,378
Speaker 1: It's not a funny place true It's a place where kids are orphaned, right?

593
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:20,120
Speaker 0: But the overall when I guess you know the whole literal reality of it What makes the movie go from just being really enjoyable and delightful to being I think a really good movie Is that the allegory is very well presented and the allegory primarily has to do with you know?

594
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,951
Speaker 0: nature versus nurture?

595
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:23,565
Speaker 0: to a degree Who is your family?

596
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:27,437
Speaker 0: You know the the combination of blood versus who raised you?

597
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:28,240
Speaker 0: how do you like?

598
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,062
Speaker 0: What is the difference?

599
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:31,431
Speaker 0: the relationship with an estranged family member?

600
00:33:31,732 --> 00:33:32,154
Speaker 0: Perhaps?

601
00:33:32,414 --> 00:33:33,920
Speaker 0: How do you start that up to?

602
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,374
Speaker 0: How do you carry the memory of perhaps lost family members in your heart?

603
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,940
Speaker 0: And how does that change you as a person?

604
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,860
Speaker 0: How do you show compassion to people who had a different upbringing that left darkness in their heart?

605
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,360
Speaker 0: Right literal darkness in this case that turns into psychic death powers.

606
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:53,261
Speaker 1: It also covers the same topics that like 50% of Japanese movies I've seen.

607
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:59,560
Speaker 1: cover which is like should you live as you've been expected to live by your parents in society or live your own life?

608
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,625
Speaker 1: and taking tests And all those sorts of things right You know?

609
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:08,900
Speaker 1: should you be that you know person who has all your shit together?

610
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,159
Speaker 1: You?

611
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:12,460
Speaker 1: should you be that wild person you know who lets loose yep?

612
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:13,583
Speaker 0: And it's it.

613
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:20,494
Speaker 0: very elegantly takes all these different allegorical threads and Weaves them together into one story.

614
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:21,500
Speaker 1: one coherent story.

615
00:34:21,543 --> 00:34:31,292
Speaker 0: Yeah One all over the place story like a really coherent story like it comes around full circle in the end Almost shockingly because of how long it was and how many threads that opened.

616
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:33,780
Speaker 0: it's kind of amazing to see them all collapse back together.

617
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,869
Speaker 1: Yep, the animations are like top tier.

618
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:39,356
Speaker 0: Oh those fights the fight scenes right.

619
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:43,188
Speaker 1: the only thing I got to say though is all the animations were the top tier.

620
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:50,831
Speaker 1: I say some of the drawings like the Backgrounds were the second tier because like for example the clouds.

621
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:52,155
Speaker 1: They're not you know.

622
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:53,958
Speaker 1: They're not the top tier class.

623
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,826
Speaker 1: Right we know who we're thinking it.

624
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:57,769
Speaker 0: What's up?

625
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,535
Speaker 0: certain centimeters per second clouds.

626
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:01,200
Speaker 1: We know who makes the best clouds.

627
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,965
Speaker 0: I promise no early days clouds.

628
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,791
Speaker 1: These are the second best class.

629
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:07,940
Speaker 1: all right you know, but yeah the animation is still incredible right?

630
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:11,611
Speaker 1: You know it looks like they drew it with computers, but it's still 2d.

631
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:12,033
Speaker 1: It's not.

632
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:16,776
Speaker 1: it's not a CGs in any way All right, so are you looking for these clouds?

633
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:17,319
Speaker 0: Yeah?

634
00:35:18,142 --> 00:35:18,804
Speaker 0: Clouds right there.

635
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:20,770
Speaker 0: look at that one the real clouds right.

636
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:23,258
Speaker 1: yeah, so you know you know it's.

637
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,740
Speaker 1: it's pretty much You know the best 2d animations you're gonna see from Japan.

638
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:32,993
Speaker 1: It doesn't look like a Ghibli movie But it looks as good as it's gonna be just in a different style than Ghibli style.

639
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:37,559
Speaker 0: right I did really enjoy the style because Actually because of the Beast world.

640
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:43,340
Speaker 1: But and they did with the human beast world in the human world have totally different styles right and totally different colors.

641
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:49,840
Speaker 1: But every character in the world is totally dark usually even like and they don't really go to the human world a lot during daytime.

642
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:55,240
Speaker 1: Very rarely do they go to the human world during daytime and usually it's like really tight shots.

643
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,068
Speaker 1: So it'll be you know poorly lit or like.

644
00:35:57,108 --> 00:36:01,596
Speaker 1: you'll see the Sun going down and in the Beast world It seems like it's just like always.

645
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:02,364
Speaker 1: daytime I don't.

646
00:36:02,384 --> 00:36:13,360
Speaker 1: you don't see a lot of night shots But it's usually indoors with candles and stuff and lights on in the Beast world at night It's you don't see a lot of like dark places in the Beast world.

647
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,060
Speaker 1: They're not going around in caves or anything like that right even when it becomes nighttime.

648
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:22,340
Speaker 1: It's like a well-lit festival kind of atmosphere all the time and bright colors.

649
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,343
Speaker 0: But that style let him.

650
00:36:23,544 --> 00:36:31,920
Speaker 0: every single character is deeply distinct both in personality and appearance Which actually lets the characters be very strong?

651
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:45,422
Speaker 0: Which actually is one of the things that really pushes the movie forward and prevents it from sort of For a movie this long with this kind of subject matter like Scott said it feels like it's on the edge of dragging Every second and then it always Steers.

652
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:48,873
Speaker 1: you feel like something's gonna be dragging out, but they don't I know.

653
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:55,533
Speaker 1: the reason they can avoid dragging is Usually they'd be like a lot of movies will like have unexplained things.

654
00:36:55,814 --> 00:37:00,432
Speaker 1: right this and this movie Just bothers not to make things questionable.

655
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,138
Speaker 1: see they're not left unexplained.

656
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:05,620
Speaker 1: for example You just goes to this Beast world right in another movie.

657
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,875
Speaker 1: You might think how is the Beast world in the human world connected?

658
00:37:08,955 --> 00:37:10,020
Speaker 1: I need to know more about this.

659
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,889
Speaker 1: This doesn't make a lot of sense, but in this movie.

660
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,320
Speaker 1: It's like beasts and humans to just go back and forth.

661
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,594
Speaker 1: It's like a physical tunnel you just to walk through it or something whatever and you don't.

662
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:23,059
Speaker 1: you're not questioning that right It's just there, and it's not like a mystery.

663
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:27,635
Speaker 1: So because it's not a mystery you don't need to dedicate any time to explaining it.

664
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,770
Speaker 1: you just show it happening And you're done.

665
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:37,795
Speaker 1: yep And by doing it does that with like a whole bunch of different things So that you only things you're thinking about are like these core plots that they're gonna spend.

666
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:40,987
Speaker 1: actually you know dedicate Seconds of you know film to.

667
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:43,897
Speaker 0: so so if I had any complaint about this movie at all.

668
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:50,583
Speaker 0: it would be that The dialogue in the fourth fifth of the movie like before the climax But kind of ab.

669
00:37:50,804 --> 00:38:05,680
Speaker 0: so after the fight and the sort of big like game-changing moving to the end of the movie event and The actual end there's this middle part where a lot of characters spend a lot of time sort of explaining things to each other.

670
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:14,339
Speaker 0: and That is the only time in the movie where it sort of did the characters talking as opposed to just showing you something and letting You smart enough to figure it out.

671
00:38:15,023 --> 00:38:18,919
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of like it felt like a lot of the things they were saying didn't matter or they were repeating.

672
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:27,468
Speaker 0: the same People complain that oh the dub must have been a bad script because the characters kept repeating themselves and like we're saying sort of inane Or obvious thing.

673
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:28,698
Speaker 1: we didn't see the dub by the way.

674
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:31,450
Speaker 0: yes But I saw that sentiment from multiple people.

675
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,916
Speaker 1: it is it has been dubbed.

676
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:33,800
Speaker 1: so if you see it in the u.s.

677
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,413
Speaker 1: It might be dubbed.

678
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:42,696
Speaker 0: yep But I didn't know that at least in the subtitled version that we saw those same scenes Just as draggy kind of pointless dialogue.

679
00:38:42,716 --> 00:38:52,254
Speaker 1: right like he goes sees He sees the girl in the library, and then he sees her again And I think he sees her like I can't remember how many times But they pretty much what feels like they had the same conversation every time right?

680
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,800
Speaker 1: yeah, it didn't feel like they were Advancing much other than okay.

681
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:58,925
Speaker 1: They saw each other again But yet the movie did.

682
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:03,343
Speaker 0: other aspects like the other four fifths of the movie Did the read.

683
00:39:03,363 --> 00:39:08,958
Speaker 0: they really did a good job of showing and not having a character explain it like the Chekhov's gun character who is?

684
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,668
Speaker 0: Obviously a human Like but nothing is said about that.

685
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,554
Speaker 0: the characters just doing just thing.

686
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:22,878
Speaker 0: and then there's one scene Where that character is older and his brother is like futzing with his tusks cuz he knows a born.

687
00:39:22,938 --> 00:39:23,560
Speaker 0: is this real toss?

688
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,679
Speaker 0: He's just kind of futzing with it, and it cuts to him, and he's kind of covering his mouth with the scarf.

689
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:37,397
Speaker 0: And I told you literally everything you needed to know about the characters their interactions the gun Chekhov is hanging out there in that tooth.

690
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,466
Speaker 0: and Then the rest of the movie.

691
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:43,940
Speaker 0: it was characters explaining to you where the guns were and when they were gonna go off and why?

692
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:44,889
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

693
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:48,820
Speaker 1: So yeah, I mean if this is playing anywhere near you go see it.

694
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,708
Speaker 1: If not, it'll be on DVD way soon.

695
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:53,240
Speaker 1: probably you can see that and you should definitely.

696
00:39:53,882 --> 00:39:57,692
Speaker 1: It'll probably be streaming somewhere right you know you got within the year.

697
00:39:58,214 --> 00:40:06,400
Speaker 1: everyone listening to this will be able to see this movie Pretty without much difficulty, and it's worth your two hours of time.

Speaker 0: Chris had odd Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

718
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:51,059
Speaker 0: You know usually Many of you will comment on my choice of odd things to put at the end or will at least point out to me either Directly or on Twitter or in the forum or something that you were one of the lucky few who?

719
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:59,355
Speaker 0: Recognized where it came from what it was what I was referencing Last several no one said anything about.

720
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:02,559
Speaker 0: so I'm just curious Do any of you know?

721
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:08,480
Speaker 0: What any of the last three weird things I put at the end of the show were or have I actually gone?

722
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,019
Speaker 0: Beyond the event horizon from which even you will never stumble upon these things on your own?

723
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:25,195
Speaker 0: But anyway that aside I'm gonna do just a weird fun thing because you guys seem really some of you are really into changing your names To mess with me in the patron manager, so what I'm gonna.

724
00:42:25,235 --> 00:42:25,416
Speaker 0: Do is.

725
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:31,531
Speaker 0: I'm gonna post a patreon thing either tonight or tomorrow, and it'll be a form.

726
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:38,448
Speaker 0: it'll be like the Q&A, but it'll be totally separate and Just put a some number of words.

727
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:39,612
Speaker 0: Hopefully a small number.

728
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:52,560
Speaker 0: if you put any too many words in there I will just ignore them, and I will probably just read Everything you've submitted in order that you submitted them from start to finish.

729
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:58,737
Speaker 0: I'm gonna figure out exactly what the details of this are gonna be and we'll see how amazingly dumb.

730
00:42:58,777 --> 00:42:59,198
Speaker 0: This is.

731
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:12,759
Speaker 0: and Now I leave you with something particularly odd starring Mark Hamill who's back from Star Wars And Annie Paz who's out of this world.
