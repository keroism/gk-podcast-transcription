1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,726
Speaker 0: It's Thursday April 26th 2018.

2
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:12,391
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:14,939
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:23,679
Speaker 0: tonight We're talking about not just failed conventions, but actual scam conventions But also fail conventions.

5
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:27,569
Speaker 1: Let's do this minimum.

6
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:42,210
Speaker 0: so yeah, I uh Every two years or so I got a new cell phone and it's about that time because I noticed that just in the last week My current cell phone which is about two years old So actually a little over two years old.

7
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:43,298
Speaker 0: I got a pretty good run with this thing.

8
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:47,140
Speaker 0: It used to have a for 30 to 40 hour battery life.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,341
Speaker 0: Like.

10
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:52,291
Speaker 0: the whole reason I bought this phone is that it's the one small Android phone like the only one.

11
00:00:52,431 --> 00:01:01,080
Speaker 0: that's good and the battery lasts forever And it's running out of juice now because it doesn't throttle itself and slow down like the iPhone does when it's batteries die.

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,307
Speaker 1: You can't just replace the battery.

13
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,280
Speaker 0: No, you can't replace batteries on most phones.

14
00:01:05,603 --> 00:01:14,932
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess I could try to take it to a custom shop, but I could replace a battery on my iPhone At an Apple store or some third-party person doing it either way.

15
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:21,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, because this phone is actually waterproof Can't just open it.

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:29,197
Speaker 1: It's been said that many phones are Waterproof and simply do not advertise as such because they don't want people to like jump in pools with their.

17
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:30,662
Speaker 0: I've jumped in pools with This one.

18
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:32,271
Speaker 0: I've used it in the water at the beach.

19
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:33,980
Speaker 0: I've showered with it.

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,845
Speaker 0: I've read FARC like while I was shot.

21
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:39,075
Speaker 1: my iPhone 7 has been through many wet.

22
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:40,880
Speaker 1: It hasn't been dropped in submerged in water.

23
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:45,024
Speaker 0: I have taken photos underwater with my phone All right, but it has.

24
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:49,559
Speaker 1: you know, it has been in many rainy and wet and splashy situations.

25
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:57,351
Speaker 0: yet It is working 100% Well, but anyway, so the batteries finally running out of steam has been about two years gonna buy a new phone I look at.

26
00:01:57,371 --> 00:02:03,360
Speaker 0: sure enough There is a brand new like just coming out the latest iteration of that same kind of phone.

27
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:06,488
Speaker 0: however Upon looking at it.

28
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:08,115
Speaker 0: It's bigger.

29
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,728
Speaker 0: It's like a Taller.

30
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:15,439
Speaker 0: Even the compact version of this phone now is starting to grow.

31
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:18,558
Speaker 0: Also, it looks really fugly.

32
00:02:20,044 --> 00:02:23,100
Speaker 0: But last year they released an updated version.

33
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:30,385
Speaker 0: That is basically just a far superior version of the phone I already have and because it's a year-old design It costs hundreds of dollars less.

34
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:33,634
Speaker 0: so I just bought it and for the first time in my life.

35
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,540
Speaker 0: I am buying a new phone.

36
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:39,139
Speaker 0: Before my old phone was actually unusable.

37
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:42,592
Speaker 1: You didn't break it on purpose to feel better about yourself.

38
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:44,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you I really do.

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,850
Speaker 0: Well, like you broke your computer so you could upgrade your computer.

40
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,192
Speaker 0: Yes.

41
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:47,613
Speaker 1: Yes.

42
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:51,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, you definitely did except that Yeah, then gave that computer to someone who then recognized.

43
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:51,950
Speaker 1: Yes.

44
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,692
Speaker 1: It was definitely broke.

45
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:54,659
Speaker 0: Oh, no you broke it and they fixed it.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,435
Speaker 1: How can I break a computer in that specific way?

47
00:02:57,455 --> 00:03:03,280
Speaker 0: Uh Even if I wanted to you set the RAM timing wrong, I assume you were smart enough to set it, right?

48
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, I always trust auto and every look.

49
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:06,048
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

50
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, just trust auto the one always just one part of your life.

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,673
Speaker 0: You just trust the auto configuration even though you should have known better.

52
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:14,240
Speaker 1: I trust auto in all parts of my life.

53
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,203
Speaker 1: I default everything.

54
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:15,965
Speaker 1: that's my policy.

55
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:17,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, uh-huh.

56
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't know that your motherboards default is some weird overclocking nonsense.

57
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, why is the default wrong?

58
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:22,691
Speaker 1: That's a good question.

59
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:24,179
Speaker 0: Why didn't you know what the default does?

60
00:03:24,782 --> 00:03:29,000
Speaker 0: I just do why'd you bride you set up your computer to break so you could buy a new one?

61
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:30,940
Speaker 0: Anyway, I bought a new phone.

62
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,991
Speaker 0: I'm gonna review it on Monday cuz it's coming tomorrow cuz I live in a city.

63
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:38,568
Speaker 0: if I buy anything on Amazon it arrives either The same day or the next day.

64
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:39,592
Speaker 0: so it's gonna be.

65
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,219
Speaker 0: it'll be waiting for me when I get home.

66
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:48,719
Speaker 0: The funny thing is our friend Chris Reimer who many of you know as the last name I say in the patreon call-outs at the end of the show every week.

67
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,346
Speaker 1: I thought what happened to Thomas Hahn?

68
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:56,900
Speaker 0: well and Thomas Hahn Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn And if they ever change the order it's gonna really fuck me up.

69
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,387
Speaker 1: They should Thomas Hahn get out.

70
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,302
Speaker 0: the only way to change the orders to change the amount of money They give us.

71
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:05,100
Speaker 1: no Thomas Hahn could go to zero and then go back to stay at zero cuz that's the smart.

72
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,031
Speaker 0: Then I wouldn't say his name.

73
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,524
Speaker 1: good So everyone go to zero.

74
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:09,589
Speaker 1: us the wise thing to do.

75
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:13,187
Speaker 0: hey that money is gonna fund our conventions gonna fund that graphic design thing You're trying to do.

76
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:16,083
Speaker 1: No, it's gonna fund Church of the beach.

77
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:22,528
Speaker 0: Nah, so yes to fund the church on the beach We would the picture under have to be a couple.

78
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:24,014
Speaker 0: order may orders of magnitude above.

79
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:25,220
Speaker 0: in fact, that is a stretch goal.

80
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:36,136
Speaker 0: There is an amount of money that is formally in the patreon And if we hit that amount We will quit our jobs and go to the beach and the only thing we'll do is make this Person with more money than you know what to do with.

81
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:37,985
Speaker 1: It's a lot of money.

82
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:40,234
Speaker 1: They should get on that everyone else zero.

83
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:44,749
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, if there's a well-known out zero rich person the full amount.

84
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:54,763
Speaker 1: if there is a wealthy benefactor out there who wants to fund us For some reason I don't think rich people like ignites because of how much we smack talk about how evil and bad rich people are there.

85
00:04:55,205 --> 00:05:02,920
Speaker 0: I know a small number of pretty rich people who listen and I don't know a lot about them, but they listen to the show and I know about them.

86
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:04,427
Speaker 1: All right, I've talked to them.

87
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:06,960
Speaker 1: All right rich person you have so much money.

88
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,609
Speaker 1: It's just a giant number in a bank account that does not affect your life in any way But you can dramatically change our lives better.

89
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,979
Speaker 1: yet the lives of someone who deserves it more than we do.

90
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:16,628
Speaker 1: What the fuck are you doing?

91
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like you won't even notice anything Tomorrow.

92
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,120
Speaker 1: just be numbers will be different big fucking wolf.

93
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:25,196
Speaker 0: I feel like they should skip funding us and go right down to someone who needs it more.

94
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:26,080
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

95
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,459
Speaker 0: Patreon for Ignite should be zero, but uh, yeah, so red system with there's a lot of news to talk about.

96
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:38,460
Speaker 0: We're avoiding talking about all the breaking news where we don't have anything new to add to the conversation.

97
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:42,400
Speaker 0: There is nothing news, but there is some pretty big news that we have a lot to say about.

98
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:44,715
Speaker 0: Is there it's your news?

99
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:53,093
Speaker 1: All right Okay, so the news is Ford which is I guess a big car company if you're in America But I guess the rest of the world doesn't necessarily give that much of a shit about.

100
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:57,913
Speaker 1: I have no idea how Ford sells Internationally, yeah, I've seen Ford's in other countries, but not much.

101
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:03,811
Speaker 1: I've never owned a Ford Yeah, but anyway, so we had Ford's some tourists and I had.

102
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:07,460
Speaker 0: I was all Plymouth Pontiac like that was where I went.

103
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:28,459
Speaker 1: anyway Ford is a big-deal car company because the name comes from Henry Ford who is the first person with a First one with a car factory the Model T the first car Yeah, I mean, I guess technically there may have been other cars before the Model T Maybe but there was the first mass-produced car that everyone could buy who had money, you

104
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:40,263
Speaker 0: know so fun side story when I when my when I was a kid and moving it in high school my family moved and we bought a house and The person who owned the house that we were buying it from when we were inspecting a Model T. We go into the garage.

105
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:43,095
Speaker 0: It's just a Model T there and we're like, oh, that's cool.

106
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,245
Speaker 0: And she's like, oh, yeah I want to go for a ride.

107
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,338
Speaker 0: She was using it as her primary car.

108
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:48,943
Speaker 1: Why not?

109
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:50,168
Speaker 1: Yeah people do that.

110
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,650
Speaker 1: It works.

111
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:52,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's real simple.

112
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:52,800
Speaker 1: Anyone can fix it.

113
00:06:52,820 --> 00:07:02,060
Speaker 1: You can fix that engine with like pliers screwdriver wrench and easy acknowledge Model T running than some other car cuz it's just so straightforward.

114
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:07,859
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if you'd like a part breaks you could just make the replacement part probably anyway.

115
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:15,078
Speaker 1: So, yeah for the news is that Ford the car company is only gonna be making two cars from now on.

116
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:16,362
Speaker 1: no more tourists no more.

117
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,249
Speaker 1: the only cars that are sedans know.

118
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:27,515
Speaker 1: the only car they're making now is the Mustang and There's one Ford Focus model that's kind of sporty and the otherwise they're only making trucks and SUVs.

119
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:29,200
Speaker 1: fuck all other models now.

120
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:32,698
Speaker 0: I think there's a lot of reasons why this is big news.

121
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:44,260
Speaker 0: one Car companies traditional ones tend to move very slowly and tend to make incremental change and very rarely will do a big Part of it is because they're old-fashioned big businesses.

122
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:47,113
Speaker 1: But also part of it is because you got a big old car factory.

123
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,740
Speaker 1: you got things away in advance.

124
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:54,178
Speaker 1: You can't just suddenly change the car factory suddenly close one suddenly open one suddenly retool one.

125
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:59,740
Speaker 1: It's not easy It takes time, but I even if they had decided to do this years ago It would have taken until now to actually make it happen.

126
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,041
Speaker 1: But the

127
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:26,732
Speaker 0: reason I think this is big news is that a lot of the car industry like commercialization model shall we say has relied forever at least for modern history on taking the identity of a person and Getting them to attach that identity to a car brand and then tying the idea of owning to a car to all these Fundamental aspects of American life like freedom and adulthood.

128
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:29,360
Speaker 1: Well, I think in other countries cars are marketed differently.

129
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,311
Speaker 1: But oh, yeah about America specific cars are marketed in America.

130
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:33,893
Speaker 1: Is that?

131
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,539
Speaker 1: it's like this whole marketing cultural thing.

132
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,392
Speaker 1: There's a car culture and an advertising culture.

133
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:40,135
Speaker 0: cars are most.

134
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:41,059
Speaker 1: the ads are car.

135
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:50,166
Speaker 0: Yes I'm pretty sure the majority of all ads in America are car ads and their sole goal is to Drive that brand recognition.

136
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:58,207
Speaker 0: and it's very interesting that when when I got adblock and never had didn't have TV anymore in high school Within a like five or six years.

137
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:01,600
Speaker 0: I didn't know what the current like makes and models of cars were anymore.

138
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:06,407
Speaker 0: I mean, I know the ones that have been around forever Yeah but I didn't know about new ones like I did.

139
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:12,834
Speaker 0: I just didn't know whereas previously that was basic common knowledge that I just Learned through osmosis from ads.

140
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:13,640
Speaker 1: but anyway.

141
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:30,093
Speaker 1: So what's happened over the years is through a combination of marketing but also other factors American people who live in car places have leaned towards driving trucks and Truck-like vehicles like SUVs or crossovers or whatever the hell you want to call

142
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:40,641
Speaker 0: partly because those are vehicles that actually have very Utilitarian purposes and also partly because those areas tend to ski more conservative and conservative people tend to ski more toward trucks SUVs.

143
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:41,263
Speaker 1: there's some.

144
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:43,910
Speaker 1: there's cultural reasons, but there's other reasons right?

145
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,554
Speaker 1: It's like my mom drives like.

146
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:47,640
Speaker 1: I think it's like a Subaru something.

147
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:53,420
Speaker 1: It's right, but the main reason that you know, she drives that instead of a car, but she drove like most of her life.

148
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:55,270
Speaker 1: It's just as higher off the ground.

149
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:56,859
Speaker 1: it's like more comfortable to be up there.

150
00:09:57,702 --> 00:10:07,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can say that it's like, you know, it's those sorts of reasons Like if you're driving a car after driving, you know, like like, you know, like a van or a truck You just feel like your ass is on the ground.

151
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:11,518
Speaker 1: You see all these other people are driving the cars that are way up above you.

152
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:13,304
Speaker 1: now It's harder to see around them.

153
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:18,875
Speaker 1: It creates this whole sort of like arms race almost but it's also a comfort You know.

154
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:23,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's you know, it's like, you know, there's all tons and tons of reasons for this.

155
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:27,730
Speaker 1: but effectively all this marketing and whatnot stuff worked.

156
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:35,615
Speaker 1: and now most people who drive cars in the United States want a truck or non sedan non car non coupe.

157
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:44,680
Speaker 0: most of the Industry and press and paid press I've read for the last decade because car sales have been on the decline in America, right?

158
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:52,279
Speaker 0: They have been making this consistent argument Paid argument like it wasn't journalists writing these things It was paid journalists like those fake stories.

159
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:57,259
Speaker 0: But they all had the same narrative that car sales are down because Millennials don't have money.

160
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:01,100
Speaker 0: Not for any other far more intrinsic reason.

161
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:05,178
Speaker 0: But I've always believed and I'm pretty confident This is still true.

162
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:10,340
Speaker 0: The reality is that a lot of Millennials want to live in places where they don't need to have a car.

163
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:12,491
Speaker 0: Have been more willing to not have a car.

164
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:15,524
Speaker 0: and it's not just that they can't afford them It's that they don't want them.

165
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:16,346
Speaker 1: I don't want one.

166
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:17,069
Speaker 1: and further

167
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:31,120
Speaker 0: even when Millennials and younger people want cars They're much more resistant to advertising than the industry projected and they don't give a shit What kind of car most people I can think of who I've talked to her younger than me who are actually like getting a car.

168
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:31,919
Speaker 0: I care about cars.

169
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:36,096
Speaker 0: They want the cheapest car that will let them drive to the thing.

170
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:36,839
Speaker 0: They need to drive to.

171
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,320
Speaker 1: yes They literally don't person the person who has grown up on the internet.

172
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:43,129
Speaker 1: Right in terms of culture they buy a car.

173
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:43,872
Speaker 0: the way they buy a cell.

174
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:50,324
Speaker 1: they may care about clothes or shoes Or their phone or their computer Office chair than a car.

175
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:52,331
Speaker 1: right these sorts of things they care about.

176
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,960
Speaker 1: but the car like it's like they don't.

177
00:11:55,521 --> 00:12:00,480
Speaker 1: Car nerdery has gone way way down in you know, the years, right?

178
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:15,111
Speaker 1: So, you know It's only certain the number of people who are nerdy for cars is very much decreased and thus Pretty much anyone who's my age who buys a car who has to buy a car gets like a Honda Civic and keeps it forever as long as it works.

179
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:15,392
Speaker 0: Yep.

180
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:22,940
Speaker 1: So case in point when I was in high school I needed like my own care more about like the fact that their iPhone integrates well with this sound system in the car.

181
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what kind of engine it has or anything like that?

182
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,322
Speaker 0: My old car.

183
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:32,715
Speaker 1: a lot of people are in I know are interested in like, you know electric car super efficient car Yeah things of that nature.

184
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:43,067
Speaker 0: And I am too if I ever buy a car again one It has to be at least a like minimally self-driving and to probably getting something that's electric I'm I'm just holding out until they're.

185
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:45,015
Speaker 1: you know, I don't have to own the car.

186
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:49,102
Speaker 1: There's just self-driving cars about And I just call one I don't.

187
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:50,352
Speaker 1: they just come up to me and I get in them.

188
00:12:50,433 --> 00:13:00,646
Speaker 0: but when I was in RIT and my previous car had literally the engine had exploded and I needed a new car because living in Rochester without a car Sucked ass.

189
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:01,189
Speaker 1: Yes.

190
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:03,620
Speaker 0: So we need we as a group needed a car.

191
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:06,619
Speaker 0: I was the one who had the most money and the ability to buy a car.

192
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:15,360
Speaker 0: so I bought a car and I remember going to car lots and like trying to buy a used car and Hating every second of it because I literally didn't care.

193
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,798
Speaker 0: I just wanted the cheapest car that would work and ended up buying this purple Sunfire.

194
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:22,508
Speaker 0: and Apparently no one was buying this thing because it was purple.

195
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:23,130
Speaker 0: Mmm.

196
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:28,216
Speaker 0: So I got it for like 10 grand and I didn't care even when I bought.

197
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:30,747
Speaker 0: I bought a Until it literally died.

198
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:30,968
Speaker 1: right.

199
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:37,540
Speaker 1: when I when I had to drive a whole bunch living in Beacon in 2006 I bought a brand new Mazda 3 cuz it was nice.

200
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,233
Speaker 1: I had a hatch which is way useful for carrying shit to conventions.

201
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:41,559
Speaker 1: that we're doing a lot at the time.

202
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:45,717
Speaker 1: Also putting a bike in the hatch stuff like that tons of groceries in the hatch.

203
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:49,039
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, but it was super nice car.

204
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:50,851
Speaker 0: We lived out in it when I lived upstate.

205
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:54,595
Speaker 1: you me and Emily each had our own car But even then it was sort of like they're like.

206
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:55,320
Speaker 1: what color do you want?

207
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,525
Speaker 1: And I'm like, I don't give a shit.

208
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,011
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it's like which one.

209
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:00,400
Speaker 1: All right, you're getting this coppery orange color.

210
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,746
Speaker 1: That's like exclusive to like.

211
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:02,007
Speaker 1: fine.

212
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:02,369
Speaker 1: Whatever.

213
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:03,554
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a cost more.

214
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:04,137
Speaker 1: No fine.

215
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:04,639
Speaker 1: Give me that one.

216
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:09,359
Speaker 0: I remember you were looking at the Volkswagen and that salesperson kept being like listen to the sound.

217
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:09,680
Speaker 0: the door

218
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:17,619
Speaker 1: Money had less space in it But it had heated seats and less fuel-efficient and also the Volkswagen dealership had a huge line at the service area

219
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:24,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, but she kept trying to sell you on like the identity of the car and you were just like I do not give one fuck.

220
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:31,211
Speaker 0: It was really funny cuz I was in the backseat While she was trying to sell you on this fucking car.

221
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:32,880
Speaker 1: Well, cuz it's about like the feel right?

222
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,639
Speaker 1: It's sort of like you're just like luxury goods, right?

223
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,120
Speaker 1: They feel a certain way.

224
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:47,178
Speaker 1: It's like the they must have constructed the doors and such in such a way where like it just gives a really satisfying Closing sound right like it, you know in the joint on the door just feels like really satisfying.

225
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:49,807
Speaker 1: to close Yeah, and it's like they're trying to sell you on that.

226
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:55,067
Speaker 1: but it's like sure that you know, it feels interesting and you know You know it like.

227
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,260
Speaker 1: but it's sort of like you're getting a really nice pencil.

228
00:14:57,601 --> 00:15:11,748
Speaker 1: It writes the same even though it just feels nice in your yeah, like ooh, it's like it's not worth thousands of dollars Yeah, and also there's that cost fallacy where if you're buying a big thing then Incremental it increases in that cost.

229
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,440
Speaker 0: most people do not value them accordingly.

230
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,124
Speaker 0: So if you're buying a two hundred thousand dollar house, which I wish there were two hundred thousand dollar houses here It's not great.

231
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,953
Speaker 1: not here not no not right here.

232
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:23,013
Speaker 1: No.

233
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:25,220
Speaker 0: Yeah actually in beacon there really aren't $200,000 house.

234
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,742
Speaker 0: there you can.

235
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:26,665
Speaker 0: I've seen the $200,000 house.

236
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:27,909
Speaker 1: I looked at in beacon was a meth lab.

237
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:34,300
Speaker 1: I've seen some things that are like trailers that are not moving.

238
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,424
Speaker 1: Trailers are $200,000 On a plot a tiny plot of land.

239
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:51,414
Speaker 0: but people who people who are buying a $200,000 house will not think that much of a $10,000 swing in either direction, but if they're buying a $10,000 car they will care a lot about a $10,000 swing in either direction.

240
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:56,280
Speaker 0: as they're buying a $5 sandwich They'll care a lot about a $1 swing in either direction.

241
00:15:57,281 --> 00:16:00,310
Speaker 0: People just have a terrible time of valuation, but I do that.

242
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:01,493
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do it too.

243
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,840
Speaker 0: It's it's it's human nature.

244
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,988
Speaker 0: It's very difficult to avoid that quandary.

245
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:07,534
Speaker 1: I'm already spending this much.

246
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:08,036
Speaker 1: What a $1 more.

247
00:16:08,156 --> 00:16:08,397
Speaker 1: All right.

248
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:11,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like that's a whole bagel extra.

249
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:12,500
Speaker 1: you're giving them an extra bait.

250
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:15,210
Speaker 0: I spent $40 more on the new cell phone.

251
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:24,932
Speaker 0: I just bought because I got the blue one instead of the black one and in retrospect $40 is like two pretty good meals in New York City.

252
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:27,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, like pretty good with like an appetizer.

253
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:41,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think to not turn this into a whole show that this news from Ford Indicates a seismic shift in the car industry in the United States Consequence of a seismic shift that already happened.

254
00:16:42,822 --> 00:16:43,725
Speaker 0: Yes, I agree.

255
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:45,609
Speaker 0: This is the consequence of a seismic shift.

256
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:53,459
Speaker 0: SUV ain't new but the seismic shift is that a car company Admitted that this is happening and is trying to get ahead of it.

257
00:16:54,402 --> 00:17:00,446
Speaker 0: All the other car cover all the way behind it are kind of fucked and it's shocking that Ford is the one that was like Wow, this is happening.

258
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:00,948
Speaker 0: Here we go.

259
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,354
Speaker 1: Well some companies right?

260
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:09,192
Speaker 1: So like I talk about Honda Civic It's like well Honda's Japanese company There's yeah, they get they're selling those civics everywhere in the world.

261
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:10,737
Speaker 1: And this is only happening in America.

262
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:19,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like how you still say America to this day because the other cut you see SUVs rolling and you know, Like I don't know Japan.

263
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:22,138
Speaker 0: I'm just still shocked that I see SUVs rolling here.

264
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, like how do you park that thing?

265
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:26,292
Speaker 0: and the answer seems to be you don't.

266
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,339
Speaker 1: people drop them in New York for some reason.

267
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I guess it'll be real interesting to see how this shakes down over the next decade.

268
00:17:35,444 --> 00:17:37,337
Speaker 1: No more Ford Taurus a legendary car.

269
00:17:37,398 --> 00:17:37,639
Speaker 1: Yeah.

270
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:41,452
Speaker 0: So in some other news, it's just sort of fascinating that this happened.

271
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:44,970
Speaker 0: So I know a lot about Serial killers.

272
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,100
Speaker 1: All right is great.

273
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:53,060
Speaker 0: Okay, next topic in this because when I was a kid remember I watched vampire 100 D when I was in fourth grade.

274
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:54,325
Speaker 1: What is vampire hundred?

275
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:59,948
Speaker 1: you had to do a serial killer because my mom really wanted me to said I watched sounds of the Lambs, I also at least make sense.

276
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:02,780
Speaker 0: I watched Silence of the Lambs when I was in elementary school.

277
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:04,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I saw it also hood.

278
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember when but I definitely saw when I was you know.

279
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:14,940
Speaker 0: But my family like my mom was really into like horror fiction and true crime stuff and disease stuff and all these things.

280
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:17,660
Speaker 0: So I just was very interested in those things as well as a child.

281
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:24,140
Speaker 0: So I knew a lot about like scary diseases and serial killers and horror nonsense.

282
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:27,272
Speaker 1: My mom was into horror but more aliens vampires.

283
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,280
Speaker 0: Oh, we were also into that.

284
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:35,197
Speaker 0: I was reading Lovecraft like Back when my elementary school teacher actually went to my parents and said do you know your son has that book?

285
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:36,080
Speaker 0: and they were like?

286
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:36,470
Speaker 0: what?

287
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:38,638
Speaker 0: lol Of course, he does.

288
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:45,840
Speaker 0: But anyway, the Golden State Killer was kind of a really extra terrifying serial killer.

289
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,768
Speaker 0: I've never heard of him before.

290
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:52,340
Speaker 0: Yeah a long time ago What's crazy is they just arrested this guy?

291
00:18:53,260 --> 00:19:08,380
Speaker 0: Now good like 40 years after he was an active serial killer slash rapist good, and the whole story behind this thing is Ridiculous and the kinds of crowd like this is a class of crime like the way it happened.

292
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:15,628
Speaker 0: That literally could not happen in a modern urban setting or even a modern suburban setting like it couldn't have gone on as long as it did.

293
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,725
Speaker 0: and it's crazy and the whole story about it is crazy and It is very.

294
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:41,040
Speaker 0: I guess it speaks well to one tiny aspect of American law enforcement that Despite all the other very obvious problems that I could point to in terms of American law enforcement The fact that the the system existed to catch this dude this late is still amazing.

295
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:42,546
Speaker 1: I mean that's you know for all.

296
00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:46,260
Speaker 0: that's the thing is like like there are good jobs who try to catch people like this.

297
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,440
Speaker 1: Well, no, I mean it's just even the bad cops try to catch people like this.

298
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:49,610
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah

299
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,350
Speaker 0: They just also shoot random innocent black people for no reason

300
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,999
Speaker 1: right is that that's the thing that they do is they'll be like they're Actually doing their job and you know enforcing the laws, you know, yeah

301
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:02,954
Speaker 0: I guess part of their job is maintaining this racist status quo,

302
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:03,375
Speaker 1: right.

303
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:15,240
Speaker 1: and then if you try to say hey Stop doing the bad stuff you do they'll say well look at the stuff that we're doing that we're supposed to do Right, and that's the thing that you know, it's like yeah They do what they're supposed to do and they also do these other bad things at the same time.

304
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,120
Speaker 1: But also just doing a good job today does not excuse doing an evil thing tomorrow.

305
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:23,637
Speaker 0: But also the nuance I want to point out is that this is the biggest like.

306
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:24,320
Speaker 0: it is big news.

307
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:25,168
Speaker 0: It's crazy news.

308
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:26,399
Speaker 0: It's a crazy story.

309
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:35,760
Speaker 0: but also if they had just ignored this guy and Maybe shot a few less innocent people it probably would have been a net benefit to society.

310
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:44,239
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

311
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:44,801
Speaker 0: What do you got?

312
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:45,785
Speaker 1: So check this out?

313
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:48,536
Speaker 1: I don't know if I use this already I forget but I don't think so.

314
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:49,721
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about this.

315
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:51,006
Speaker 1: Okay, so check this out.

316
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:52,010
Speaker 1: It's an NES ROM.

317
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:52,910
Speaker 1: It's a file.

318
00:20:53,211 --> 00:21:02,850
Speaker 1: It's a series of zeros and ones on your file system and they add the file name ends and dot NES and you can open It up in your NES emulator and run it because it's a valid NES ROM.

319
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:07,870
Speaker 1: You could put it onto a cartridge and put it in NES and it would run and a game would appear.

320
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,217
Speaker 1: I don't know what the game looks like.

321
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:11,530
Speaker 1: I haven't tried to run it, but it's an NES file.

322
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:21,670
Speaker 1: Anyway at the same time if you take those exact same set of zeros and ones and you just rename the file To dot zip it is also a zip file.

323
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:25,542
Speaker 1: It is a zip file and an NES file the same set of zeros and ones.

324
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:43,690
Speaker 1: and if you were to unzip That ROM which is also a zip file out would come some source code Like actual source code and if you were to run that source code through a compiler Out would come the set of zeros and ones that is an NES ROM and also a zip file.

325
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,688
Speaker 0: I don't even know what to say about this.

326
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:47,067
Speaker 1: the end.

327
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:56,470
Speaker 1: This is like that you could you could compile it and unzip it and then take the stuff that comes out and compile it and unzip And any one of those zips could be run in the emulator.

328
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:05,915
Speaker 0: I've seen stuff like the recursive script of a dolphin or whatever or like the cell compile But this takes it to a level that is Amazing.

329
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:13,910
Speaker 0: It's like the speed will Fun like toy code exercises like this become the speed running of computer science.

330
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,097
Speaker 1: yeah, you're gonna need a copy.

331
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:27,035
Speaker 1: if you want to do actually do this, you're gonna need zip Python 3 and ASM 6. it's the assembly compiler because the source code that comes out is assembly Right, this is amazing.

332
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:31,670
Speaker 1: If you try to use some other assembler, it might not assemble into the exact set of zeros and ones.

333
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:36,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, so there's a song Scott hadn't heard it which I'm kind of surprised by.

334
00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:48,830
Speaker 0: but if you poke around in the red parts of the internet parts of this song or remixes of parts of the song are used in a shockingly wide variety of memes and gifs with sound type things like.

335
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:51,450
Speaker 0: You'll hear this song a lot if you're in the right parts of the Internet.

336
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:55,590
Speaker 0: Most people don't seem to know anything about where the song came from what the deal is with it.

337
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:59,870
Speaker 0: I'll play a snippet at the end of the show and you'll I'm pretty sure something you'll be like.

338
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:00,815
Speaker 0: Oh that song.

339
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:08,629
Speaker 1: I hadn't heard the song before but you can tell from the instrumentation That it is a Commodore 64 song because it sounds like it's coming from a SID chip and it is yep.

340
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:17,087
Speaker 0: but the song is Rob Hubbard's Monty on the run theme from a Commodore 64 game called Monty on the run.

341
00:23:17,107 --> 00:23:17,810
Speaker 1: never heard of this game.

342
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,269
Speaker 0: You don't need to play the game.

343
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:22,384
Speaker 0: It is not worth playing in the modern era at any point.

344
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:29,344
Speaker 1: but Commodore 64 games universally almost universally have amazing music because that's what the system had the capability for.

345
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:45,349
Speaker 1: and among those games the soundtrack to Monty on the run I think until exceptional I think until like the Super Nintendo and Genesis the Commodore 64 still had better audio than like any other Non-computer, but I cannot stress to you how good this song is.

346
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:52,254
Speaker 0: Well, this soundtrack is and I implore you to listen to this entire thing In the meta moment.

347
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:57,150
Speaker 0: the geek nights book club book is homas the Odyssey translated by Emily Wilson.

348
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:58,557
Speaker 1: Not some other translation.

349
00:23:58,637 --> 00:23:59,642
Speaker 1: only the Emily Wilson.

350
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:01,029
Speaker 0: true only the Emily Wilson one.

351
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:02,356
Speaker 0: I'm.

352
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:05,090
Speaker 0: uh, I'm still really into it and you guys should just read it.

353
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,121
Speaker 0: If you've never read the Odyssey just read this translation.

354
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:16,377
Speaker 1: Don't bother easiest of the Odyssey translations I have seen to read and understand because it is in a modern language and not Pretend old language.

355
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:27,030
Speaker 0: if you've read the Odyssey before Read this Anyway, I think you'll have a very different perception of some of the aspects of the Odyssey when read through modern language.

356
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:28,650
Speaker 0: I'm on our educated pop-up book.

357
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:39,210
Speaker 0: Pop-up book Odyssey is also real good But even the pop-up book Odyssey does not really drive home the degree to which Slavery was a part of pre-greek society.

358
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:44,170
Speaker 1: There's also a lot more Agamemnon in the pop-up book Odyssey that was not yet appeared in the text.

359
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:45,598
Speaker 0: Is there any Lega lamb?

360
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:45,920
Speaker 0: none?

361
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,806
Speaker 1: I hope so.

362
00:24:47,248 --> 00:24:57,110
Speaker 0: I got Otherwise geek nights But me not Scott will be live not this weekend, but next weekend at Zenkai con in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

363
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,095
Speaker 0: It's gonna be amazing.

364
00:24:58,457 --> 00:24:58,979
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

365
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

366
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:01,170
Speaker 1: It's gonna be a waste of your week.

367
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,560
Speaker 0: I don't know why you're so down on those con.

368
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,829
Speaker 0: I have a great time every year.

369
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:06,500
Speaker 1: It's Lancaster, Pennsylvania is not a place you want to go.

370
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:26,236
Speaker 0: I have more fun and I'm gonna be honest I have had more fun at the average Zenkai con than I did at the average anime Boston even at the peak of our going to anime Boston because all our board game friends go and all I do other than doing our panels is eat awesome like farm-to-table food or Play board games.

371
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:31,136
Speaker 1: You just break your microphone stand on purpose So you could buy a new one.

372
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:33,690
Speaker 0: No, I just popped the spring off because it pops off really easily.

373
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:35,119
Speaker 1: You just broke it.

374
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:38,053
Speaker 0: No spring just lashes on here It's not it's not.

375
00:25:38,094 --> 00:25:42,567
Speaker 0: an intrinsic property of this literally the cheapest microphone boom on Amazon.

376
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:48,110
Speaker 0: Okay, so And other meta things we're looking to hire a graphic designer.

377
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,796
Speaker 0: We talked about it a lot in the previous show.

378
00:25:50,097 --> 00:25:53,749
Speaker 0: if you think you could fully rebrand geek nights

379
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:55,893
Speaker 1: Professionally like

380
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:56,976
Speaker 0: we're talking like

381
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:57,718
Speaker 1: press

382
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,002
Speaker 0: kits logos

383
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,327
Speaker 1: like if you're ever like

384
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:01,410
Speaker 0: ocean graphics

385
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:12,886
Speaker 1: Right someone who is pro level like you could do it for a legit company that people know the name of level Because you're gonna be paid at probably at least four digits worth of money for this job.

386
00:26:13,027 --> 00:26:13,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, not more.

387
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a real job.

388
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:16,459
Speaker 1: You're gonna pay money.

389
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:19,430
Speaker 1: You got to be real good to do this job, right?

390
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:30,686
Speaker 1: We're not looking for someone who's does graphic design for like you local eSports team or you local small business because frankly our website Looks like web 2.0 point one, right?

391
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:36,150
Speaker 1: The idea is to get something done that's so good that it can last for like fucking ever and be timeless.

392
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:40,710
Speaker 1: You know the way like, you know, like the greatest logo like a McDonald's timeless, right?

393
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:44,463
Speaker 1: Obviously, we're not gonna get that level like one or two levels under that.

394
00:26:44,623 --> 00:26:45,566
Speaker 0: hungry for apples.

395
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:53,440
Speaker 1: Yeah So there are many places on the internet Besides this podcast and you should come find us in all those places.

396
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:59,540
Speaker 1: if you think about places that exist on the internet YouTube Twitter Even Facebook, I guess if you haven't deleted your account.

397
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:01,064
Speaker 1: We're in those places.

398
00:27:01,405 --> 00:27:02,268
Speaker 1: Come find us there.

399
00:27:02,449 --> 00:27:08,790
Speaker 0: seriously Just type the word geek nights into Google and a lot of different things appear.

400
00:27:09,992 --> 00:27:11,362
Speaker 0: We pretty much only one word.

401
00:27:11,383 --> 00:27:12,370
Speaker 1: there's no space in the middle.

402
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:14,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder what happens if I put a space in the middle.

403
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:16,612
Speaker 1: try it and see Same thing.

404
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,459
Speaker 0: Okay, same list.

405
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:21,770
Speaker 0: All right geek nights podcast on TV tropes.

406
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:23,960
Speaker 1: Who made a TV tropes page?

407
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:24,925
Speaker 1: that's been there for a long time.

408
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:25,890
Speaker 0: I guess I never noticed.

409
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:36,098
Speaker 0: Okay interesting anyway, so we're not going to talk about these specifics of Universal fan con.

410
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:39,877
Speaker 0: it is just the most recent Egregious convention failure.

411
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:43,210
Speaker 1: It is my opinion and not all these things are conventions.

412
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:43,591
Speaker 1: There was.

413
00:27:44,153 --> 00:27:46,561
Speaker 1: there was the the the thing that was higher festival.

414
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,510
Speaker 1: Yeah fire festival and dash come.

415
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I guess what the what we want to talk about - can't happen.

416
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,530
Speaker 0: it technically happened.

417
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:57,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't happen again.

418
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,740
Speaker 0: No, but go thing.

419
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:05,640
Speaker 0: there's been a rash of Multiple kinds of convention failures lately.

420
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,146
Speaker 0: We've done shows on major

421
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:10,818
Speaker 1: major events Yeah festival failures as well Expos,

422
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:24,185
Speaker 0: but they've broken down into sort of three categories and one of those categories I think is something that we need to talk about because I think this is I feel like the problem We're about to describe is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.

423
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:25,510
Speaker 1: I've seen it getting worse.

424
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,434
Speaker 1: So it's like I can see.

425
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,970
Speaker 1: the snowball has already rolled halfway down the hill and it ain't stopping.

426
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:34,370
Speaker 1: Yep, so you got anyone who doesn't see that snowball halfway down the hill better open the eyes.

427
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:48,850
Speaker 0: so the first thing we're not going to talk about are conventions and events that happen But are just really shitty like - con like - con or lie Chris - con ages into the second category heavily.

428
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:54,910
Speaker 0: There's a there's a Venn diagram here and at the center is a lot of sad kids who show up in a time.

429
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,399
Speaker 1: For example the first Ohio con we went to right.

430
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:58,101
Speaker 1: it was a con.

431
00:28:58,563 --> 00:29:00,409
Speaker 1: it happened right they ran it.

432
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:03,848
Speaker 1: It was just a lot of failures at the actual event.

433
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:10,228
Speaker 1: Yeah Logistically and otherwise like to the point that we would never go back, you know, there's the sit-a-con we went to.

434
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,552
Speaker 1: yeah It was just like.

435
00:29:11,572 --> 00:29:14,020
Speaker 1: well it actually happened but the turnout was just like.

436
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:15,405
Speaker 0: it wasn't a scam.

437
00:29:15,485 --> 00:29:16,890
Speaker 0: It just sucked right.

438
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,996
Speaker 1: It's like there's a lot of people.

439
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:19,042
Speaker 1: they run a convention.

440
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:24,670
Speaker 1: They make it happen They put on the event like Philly wizard world happened a bunch of times.

441
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,860
Speaker 1: It's either you know, maybe it's just.

442
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:28,890
Speaker 1: maybe it happens and it's just a bad convention.

443
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,810
Speaker 1: Maybe it happens and no one shows up or maybe that happens in this logistical failures at the thing.

444
00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:36,858
Speaker 1: But they happen, right?

445
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:37,922
Speaker 0: I gotta get interrupt.

446
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:41,174
Speaker 0: someone pointed when we're talking about the graphic design Someone just said in the chat.

447
00:29:41,676 --> 00:29:47,496
Speaker 0: What if we dig spelled capital di GG your website's current look Mm-hmm.

448
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:47,776
Speaker 0: That's it.

449
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:50,787
Speaker 0: That's the appropriate level of burn for our current website.

450
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:56,670
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah We're not talking about conventions that just suck or fail in the traditional sense.

451
00:29:57,533 --> 00:29:58,698
Speaker 0: But that is the thing that happens.

452
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:23,006
Speaker 0: There's another kind of convention that fails Before it happens or fails in a way that prevents the event from continuing Almost always either because it was oversold and the fire marshal shut it down Or the people who ran it were so incompetent that they failed to do things like Put the requisite deposit down for the convention center

453
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:24,372
Speaker 1: have insurance Yep,

454
00:30:24,713 --> 00:30:29,149
Speaker 0: have enough money to pay for the things you need to pay for during the event,

455
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:29,530
Speaker 1: right?

456
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:38,570
Speaker 1: So like the the the fire festival right is everyone showed up to this place But like they didn't have water for people to yeah, like there wasn't an event.

457
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:40,373
Speaker 1: I don't remember the details But I remember.

458
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:44,030
Speaker 1: I vaguely remember something like there weren't toilets to go in of course.

459
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:47,465
Speaker 1: So suddenly you've got a group of people in a place and now it's just.

460
00:30:47,867 --> 00:30:48,590
Speaker 1: it's unfunctionable.

461
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:55,903
Speaker 1: Right as opposed to say like Ohio con where it's like Oh The tournaments didn't happen or the video game systems weren't.

462
00:30:56,546 --> 00:31:02,790
Speaker 0: like we show up in Baltimore And an anime convention that we pre-registered for net hotel for just isn't happening.

463
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:06,382
Speaker 0: Like we show up at the convention center The doors are locked and that's it.

464
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:12,809
Speaker 1: a whole bunch of people go to PAX They're outside the doors and they can't get in that things aren't set up on the inside.

465
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,451
Speaker 0: now It's interesting.

466
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,495
Speaker 0: you mentioned fire festival.

467
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:15,779
Speaker 1: Someone shows up to their panel.

468
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,685
Speaker 1: There's just no equipment and no enforcer.

469
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:24,850
Speaker 0: pretty sure some Charges were filed around fire festival because here's the third part and this is where things get interesting.

470
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,098
Speaker 0: I also want to say very clearly right now.

471
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,303
Speaker 0: We're not lawyers.

472
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:34,600
Speaker 0: We are not making specific Accusations against specific events who may have know enough about any of them to do so.

473
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,866
Speaker 0: But fire festival and Fan con and conventions like it.

474
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:51,200
Speaker 0: there is a line between it failed because the people who ran it sucked And it failed because it was designed to fail and was actually a scam, right?

475
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:57,343
Speaker 1: It's hard to tell the difference and sometimes you'll never even know the difference and it doesn't matter It's the same thing either way now.

476
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:06,610
Speaker 0: I suspect very strongly that there are Actual events that have happened in the last several years that were scams from the beginning.

477
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:12,265
Speaker 0: Yes And I feel like they're going to be a lot of these because of the more fundamental problem one.

478
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:17,910
Speaker 0: as we learn from black beauty Ignorance and malice have the exact same effect on it on their victims.

479
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:22,061
Speaker 0: So it does not matter why a convention fails in this matter.

480
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:24,909
Speaker 0: It harms people who try to attend it the same way.

481
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:48,424
Speaker 0: but also there's this extra weird problem that is specifically to certain kinds of conventions and events where there are a lot of people both on the on the privileged side who know things about these events and have worldly experience and on the underprivileged side who literally don't have Experience with these things like people have never been to a concert never been to a convention.

482
00:32:49,487 --> 00:33:01,850
Speaker 0: in both groups There's a huge percentage of people who are willing to give other people Large amounts of money To attend events that they assume will exist because there's a website that says that event exists.

483
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:08,312
Speaker 1: Well, I mean this people willing to give people money just because the website has a thing on it for not just conventions But anything.

484
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:09,335
Speaker 1: yeah, it's like.

485
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,258
Speaker 1: I don't really.

486
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:15,412
Speaker 1: I think a lot of this actually comes down to not necessarily conventions.

487
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:22,476
Speaker 1: conventions like a special most egregious case of a larger problem of simply Pre-crowdfunding anything right.

488
00:33:22,777 --> 00:33:24,181
Speaker 1: someone puts up a fake board game.

489
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:26,307
Speaker 1: everyone pays money because they want the board game.

490
00:33:26,327 --> 00:33:27,290
Speaker 1: the board game never ships.

491
00:33:27,474 --> 00:33:29,133
Speaker 1: Yep, right It's the same thing.

492
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:40,550
Speaker 1: the difference is that when it's a convention or an event of large scale right or moderate scale People not only you know pay like oh, I pay $40 or a board game that I never get.

493
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:43,881
Speaker 1: I'm out 40 bucks, which could be a big deal for the convention.

494
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:46,550
Speaker 0: Okay, like a first night at the hotel.

495
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,557
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not only you're also.

496
00:33:48,758 --> 00:33:52,050
Speaker 1: probably you can cancel your hotel rooms up to 24 hours in advance depends.

497
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:53,502
Speaker 0: So there's but flights.

498
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:54,289
Speaker 1: know you're boned.

499
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,937
Speaker 0: There is an icing trend.

500
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:58,710
Speaker 1: actually he's already putting your vacation days at work.

501
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:03,950
Speaker 0: You or who knows maybe you're vending at it and you shipped things to the convention.

502
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,023
Speaker 1: Maybe yeah, you started printing and manufacturing merchandise.

503
00:34:07,063 --> 00:34:08,670
Speaker 1: You started, you know marketing.

504
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,590
Speaker 0: I don't have one out Scott.

505
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:16,130
Speaker 0: There's been a trend increasingly with a lot of conventions where the hotel blocks have policies of a week or a month in advance.

506
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:17,255
Speaker 1: Never seen that before.

507
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:20,310
Speaker 0: I have seen it many times in the last three or four years.

508
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,255
Speaker 1: I've never seen a hotel reservation.

509
00:34:22,297 --> 00:34:23,862
Speaker 1: That was the longest I've seen is 48 hours.

510
00:34:23,882 --> 00:34:27,549
Speaker 1: I have seen No, I don't deny it.

511
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:33,130
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying I've never personally never seen more than 40 seen one month for multiple events recently.

512
00:34:33,853 --> 00:34:41,889
Speaker 0: And I have seen events that I did not go to Where the policy was you cannot cancel a hotel if you book it through the conventions block.

513
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:53,521
Speaker 0: And this is happening because the idea of hotel blocks is becoming obsolete because literally any major event will sell out every hotel in every City anyway, so no one has an incentive like no hotel.

514
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:56,610
Speaker 0: Well has any reason to provide discounted rooms anymore?

515
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:06,849
Speaker 1: No, not discounted But the incentive is for the events to partner with the hotels to make sure that those Rooms are set aside for its attendees and not for people doing anything else in town.

516
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:13,370
Speaker 1: Otherwise the convention won't get enough people coming to it because they can't get rooms and it'll hurt the convention itself.

517
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,720
Speaker 1: So the hotels can actually if your event is selling out.

518
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can charge the events say hey give us money It's a lot set these room asides for you.

519
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,230
Speaker 0: But the hotels increasingly can back away from the traditional SLA of canceling hotels.

520
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:28,490
Speaker 0: But anyway, that's a sort of side problem.

521
00:35:28,678 --> 00:35:38,810
Speaker 1: But yeah The point is is that when it's a convention that people are crowdfunding and paying for in advance People are putting in a lot more investment and they get way way way more boned when it fails.

522
00:35:39,051 --> 00:35:42,928
Speaker 1: Maybe they've even like you've gone to the place and then found that it failed.

523
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:45,789
Speaker 1: now They really have been super boned, right?

524
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,190
Speaker 1: You actually flew to a place stayed in the hotel went to a town and there's nothing there.

525
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:57,668
Speaker 0: So that latter part is what extra terrifies because it's one thing if someone gets scanned by a website and buys a board game That doesn't exist.

526
00:35:58,437 --> 00:36:13,865
Speaker 0: but if someone Does enough research to know say like, you know The examples from packs where there are people who have never been to a packs before who know that a particular YouTube streamer is Performing at this packs in a particular room not performing appearing.

527
00:36:14,246 --> 00:36:15,350
Speaker 0: Yeah appearing not music.

528
00:36:16,895 --> 00:36:22,129
Speaker 0: So this person knows that this event exists and that a person they want to see is going to be in a room at this convention

529
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:23,213
Speaker 1: But do

530
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:24,336
Speaker 0: not know what

531
00:36:24,456 --> 00:36:24,918
Speaker 1: day

532
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:38,450
Speaker 0: of the event that person is in the room and make arrangements to travel to the event Anyway, and then make a terrible mistake because the event was on Saturday instead of Friday Mm-hmm, though the number of people then I have a lot of experience

533
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,950
Speaker 1: Specifically doesn't post the schedule until very close to the actual convention.

534
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:45,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you have to buy your tickets way way way in advance.

535
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:50,510
Speaker 1: And if you really if you're going there to see, you know, your markiplier, are you buying all four days?

536
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,693
Speaker 0: Ah, but this is the thing.

537
00:36:51,794 --> 00:37:06,365
Speaker 0: people who attend conventions and having worked on a lot of conventions over the years Not just attended them I can say that a huge percentage of the people who go to nerd cons literally do Zero research about the event before they attend.

538
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:07,370
Speaker 1: somehow they get there.

539
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:13,929
Speaker 0: Yeah But like they don't know that hotels charge sales tax and can't pay for their room like.

540
00:37:14,129 --> 00:37:21,030
Speaker 1: so How can how can the person that ignorant and clueless possibly be able to tell a real convention from a scam convention?

541
00:37:21,652 --> 00:37:32,869
Speaker 0: So I think what I want to talk about right now is how to tell the difference between a convention that's likely to occur Versus a contention that is likely to not occur or fail in some disastrous way.

542
00:37:33,612 --> 00:37:36,841
Speaker 0: Rule number one if it is a first-year convention.

543
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:39,650
Speaker 0: There's already like a 20% chance of failure, right?

544
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:58,210
Speaker 1: So a first-year convention, even if it's trying to honestly happen is so difficult Especially if the people doing it don't have a lot of experience doing it So many ways it can fail in so many different categories That it's like the odds of failure are very very high even if everything that they're trying hard and they're honest.

545
00:37:58,391 --> 00:38:01,263
Speaker 1: So if it's a first-year convention now, here's the thing.

546
00:38:01,303 --> 00:38:11,506
Speaker 1: if I just say don't go to first-year conventions That's bad because especially because we want to do a convention Well, no, but you're basically saying not just that but yeah You're basically saying look the conventions we have are the only ones we can ever have.

547
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:14,558
Speaker 1: We should never have competition We should never have new ideas or anything.

548
00:38:14,598 --> 00:38:16,306
Speaker 1: No, we need to have new conventions.

549
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:23,850
Speaker 1: the more the merrier Right, but how do we make sure that people aren't taking risks and going to first-year conventions that are too risky?

550
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:24,741
Speaker 1: And here's my advice.

551
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,754
Speaker 0: It's real simple All right I'm curious what your advice is.

552
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:40,186
Speaker 1: now my only go to a first-year convention if it's a Near you and that it's not a really big deal and B Don't pre-register or pre-order a first-year convention should not and will not sell out because it's brand new.

553
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,850
Speaker 1: buy tickets at the door.

554
00:38:42,675 --> 00:38:43,448
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

555
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:50,501
Speaker 0: Most first-year conventions either do a Kickstarter or Need a certain amount of pre-regis to even happen.

556
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:57,970
Speaker 1: I would not kickstart a Either so cheap or very close to me so I don't have to risk the hotel.

557
00:38:58,312 --> 00:39:00,467
Speaker 1: I would only be risking the price of the badge and such.

558
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:11,490
Speaker 0: Yep So I think a more nuanced approach is if a first-year convention Targets and attendance of more than a few hundred people Avoid like the plague.

559
00:39:11,511 --> 00:39:19,390
Speaker 0: Yes Because it is unless that first-year convention is being run by a corporation like the new anime convention, New York City.

560
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:29,685
Speaker 0: It's run by a real company that has real employees who have experience running big conventions in the Jacob Javits Center Right, for example, I'm confident that convention have like Disney.

561
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:30,609
Speaker 1: I think is gonna do some.

562
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,395
Speaker 1: you know They've always had the Star Wars con.

563
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:34,541
Speaker 1: There's gonna be Disney Con.

564
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:35,444
Speaker 1: You know, it's legit.

565
00:39:35,564 --> 00:39:37,410
Speaker 0: It has bro runs of My Little Pony con.

566
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:54,650
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it'll happen right, but if Someone on Kickstarter is kick-starting their My Little Pony Steven Universe con and they're gonna have an artist alley and they're gonna have 10,000 people attend that convention is almost guaranteed either going to fail or is actually a scam.

567
00:39:55,534 --> 00:39:58,529
Speaker 1: If you see like a small first-year convention, right?

568
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,096
Speaker 1: Usually if you're like you're trying to suss out how legit it is, right?

569
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:06,244
Speaker 1: Check that guest list, right and Try to meet.

570
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:08,533
Speaker 1: if those guests one of them is gonna be someone you want to see.

571
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:09,357
Speaker 1: otherwise, why you going?

572
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:11,223
Speaker 1: yeah Contact them.

573
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:16,901
Speaker 1: Ah, so y'all cuz if there's a first-year con the guest isn't gonna be so big you can't contact them Right.

574
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:24,809
Speaker 0: Well if they are if there's a first-year con and their guests are like Barack Obama and carrot top Something's up.

575
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:30,580
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't know why carrot top is always the first-year con and the guests are Riven Scott.

576
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,607
Speaker 1: Contact Riven Scott to see.

577
00:40:32,968 --> 00:40:36,300
Speaker 1: are they actually going to this thing, you know, can it be trusted?

578
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:42,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, get try to contact and communicate with other people who are going or of Kimmy or know the people running it.

579
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:48,520
Speaker 1: You know, you gotta do some sort of you know networking whatever to figure out how legit is this con?

580
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,544
Speaker 1: Maybe you'll call us back.

581
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:51,535
Speaker 1: Hey, I see you guys are guests of this first-year con.

582
00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:52,400
Speaker 0: We might be like what?

583
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, we might be like what.

584
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:54,629
Speaker 1: I don't know what that is.

585
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,520
Speaker 0: or and you might laugh that happens a lot.

586
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,289
Speaker 0: You know many of these fake fucking conventions.

587
00:40:58,651 --> 00:41:04,474
Speaker 0: just say they have a guest attending And that guest was never invited to the convention.

588
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:05,619
Speaker 1: They don't even know what the hell it is.

589
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, or they're like they're selling autographs for someone who hasn't hasn't actually signed a contract to come yet.

590
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:14,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, but maybe you contact us and we say oh, yeah that cons being run by our friend.

591
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,047
Speaker 1: I think you should definitely come.

592
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:16,870
Speaker 1: I know it's legit.

593
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,673
Speaker 1: It's it's real.

594
00:41:17,713 --> 00:41:19,340
Speaker 1: You'll hear us talk about it in the meta moment.

595
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, then, you know, you can go.

596
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,040
Speaker 1: if you trust us you got to trust somebody right?

597
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,700
Speaker 1: The point is you get to find someone you can trust in this chain here.

598
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:32,813
Speaker 1: If you don't know the people running the con Right, then you got to find someone else who knows them that you can trust.

599
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:45,066
Speaker 0: if there's no one you trust then You got to stay away wait for the second year If a first-year con is in a large convention center and not run by a big company I'm pretty much a hundred percent.

600
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:45,708
Speaker 0: It's gonna fail.

601
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:49,715
Speaker 1: No, it's got to be in a small place like a hotel ballroom at the biggest Yep.

602
00:41:51,421 --> 00:42:03,800
Speaker 0: If a first-year comms website has a lot of like Squarespace looking graphic design and looks really slick But there's no actual content Like there's no community stuff.

603
00:42:04,081 --> 00:42:04,703
Speaker 0: There's no like.

604
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:13,120
Speaker 0: there's nothing there below the surface and there's a lot of promises about like an artist alley But there's no form to sign up for an artist alley.

605
00:42:13,804 --> 00:42:16,140
Speaker 0: Avoid it because it's probably just a scam at that point.

606
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:26,120
Speaker 1: If you try to talk to the other people who are thinking about going to this con right and see how Communicative are the people running it with this, you know, you form this community of attendees.

607
00:42:26,582 --> 00:42:30,100
Speaker 1: How communicative are the people running the con with the attendee group, right?

608
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,573
Speaker 1: And what are they giving you specifics or are they leading you on?

609
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:41,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they can't say oh, yes It's on this day in this place and here's our you know Like they're not showing that they're doing all the things like.

610
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:46,812
Speaker 1: here's our policies on this and here's a weapons thing And here's you know, we're gonna have his.

611
00:42:46,953 --> 00:42:47,860
Speaker 1: we're working on the schedule.

612
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, right also cut tape.

613
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,510
Speaker 1: they're just sort of like.

614
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:51,916
Speaker 1: yeah guys sign up.

615
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:52,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's gonna be great.

616
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,826
Speaker 1: It's like uh-huh.

617
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:54,672
Speaker 0: Oh even more than that.

618
00:42:54,712 --> 00:42:56,161
Speaker 0: This is like a specific one I've.

619
00:42:56,422 --> 00:42:57,226
Speaker 1: they don't say anything.

620
00:42:57,748 --> 00:43:00,820
Speaker 0: if take if they have like, you know, there's policies on their website.

621
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,664
Speaker 0: Let's say about stuff.

622
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:12,045
Speaker 0: takes a few sets of text from their website Type and copy paste it into Google and see if that appears in Generic websites.

623
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:15,239
Speaker 1: also look if you can get the names of the people running the con.

624
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:19,608
Speaker 0: and well If you can't get the names of the people running the con Probably a fail.

625
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:21,220
Speaker 1: right but Google them and see what's up.

626
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,580
Speaker 1: One of the ones that recently failed the person who ran it ran a previous.

627
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:28,795
Speaker 1: This is the second time they did this and they got away with the both time.

628
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:31,104
Speaker 0: Yep, right This is the segue.

629
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:33,912
Speaker 1: only after the second fail did people point out.

630
00:43:33,972 --> 00:43:36,560
Speaker 1: Hey that same person did both of these fails.

631
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:44,940
Speaker 1: Why would somebody who did a failing con if they tried to if they were gonna try again Wouldn't they run the exact same like be like, okay, I failed.

632
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,025
Speaker 1: Honestly, I'm gonna try to do the exact same con again.

633
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:50,610
Speaker 1: No, they tried to do a different con the second time.

634
00:43:52,683 --> 00:43:53,668
Speaker 0: Well, you know what this is.

635
00:43:53,688 --> 00:43:56,280
Speaker 0: this is getting into the final point like the thing I'm worried about.

636
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,692
Speaker 0: that I think is gonna happen a lot.

637
00:43:58,459 --> 00:44:04,880
Speaker 0: I Think there's gonna be a lot of fan conventions over the next few years that are basically the producers.

638
00:44:05,423 --> 00:44:08,560
Speaker 0: Yes, and I think the roadmap for this seems pretty clear.

639
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,866
Speaker 1: If you know anyone doesn't know what that means.

640
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:12,660
Speaker 1: go to your video source.

641
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,391
Speaker 0: Just type the word the producers into Google right.

642
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:17,440
Speaker 1: make sure you watch the Mel Brooks movie.

643
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,653
Speaker 1: If you can't go to like a theater and see it performed.

644
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:21,758
Speaker 0: I should watch that movie again.

645
00:44:21,818 --> 00:44:22,822
Speaker 0: It's been a while Why not?

646
00:44:22,943 --> 00:44:23,686
Speaker 0: That movie is so good.

647
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:24,711
Speaker 1: Why not watch it every day.

648
00:44:24,993 --> 00:44:26,380
Speaker 0: That movie is so great.

649
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:31,513
Speaker 1: But yeah, make sure you watch the Mel Brooks Gene Wilder producers.

650
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:33,820
Speaker 1: Oh my god, and not any other producers.

651
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,659
Speaker 0: Here's the roadmap that I see.

652
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:41,615
Speaker 0: First you have a you and a small number of people are gonna run the convention scam Mm-hmm.

653
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:49,624
Speaker 0: But if you just scam people like you kick start a con and just don't do anything and steal all the money You can get sued in trouble.

654
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,748
Speaker 0: You've got your scam fraud.

655
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:55,104
Speaker 0: You need to Proudfund the convention.

656
00:44:55,766 --> 00:45:00,400
Speaker 0: put the token effort in to show that you did some minimum level of due diligence.

657
00:45:00,641 --> 00:45:02,047
Speaker 0: But here's what you do.

658
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:16,131
Speaker 0: you target the convention at either underprivileged people Unworldly people narrow fandoms that are underserved like go straight line for like ladybug Whatever or Steven Universe, whatever like.

659
00:45:16,212 --> 00:45:17,840
Speaker 1: I mean, there are some cons like that.

660
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,900
Speaker 1: I think there's like a gargoyles con I've heard about right now like a Jim and the Holograms con somewhere.

661
00:45:23,141 --> 00:45:27,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, these super narrow cons that do happen are pretty good for the people.

662
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:32,700
Speaker 1: or in those fandoms and I write so it's like if I Were to run saying what's something really narrow?

663
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,006
Speaker 0: Thundercats Thundercon.

664
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:37,371
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a little bigger than those.

665
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:43,851
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's still pretty niche right the Thundercats con I'd be like lionos coming everybody.

666
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:50,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I might actually want if it was close I would go to if it was clay if it was in New York City, I would go to.

667
00:45:50,076 --> 00:45:50,739
Speaker 0: it is I could.

668
00:45:52,394 --> 00:46:00,954
Speaker 0: But But What you do then and this is what I've seen happen a lot of these cons that fail.

669
00:46:01,415 --> 00:46:01,616
Speaker 0: they.

670
00:46:01,776 --> 00:46:11,299
Speaker 0: they fail in a way Like they're designed to fail in a way that could in court Plausibly be put off on the staff having made mistakes and fucked up.

671
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:18,860
Speaker 0: Negligence as opposed to gross negligence negligence as opposed to actual fraud.

672
00:46:19,522 --> 00:46:32,760
Speaker 0: So I think what they do is you find people who go to a lot of conventions or maybe we're Low-level staff at a bunch of conventions like someone who's like well, for example this person who I've heard.

673
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:35,575
Speaker 1: I don't I'm not saying the person's name because I just saw this in some tweets.

674
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:36,500
Speaker 0: I write about it, too.

675
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:38,800
Speaker 0: I'm not a name because I don't want to get involved, right?

676
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:54,920
Speaker 1: but the person who tried to run this recent con and the other one that failed both and it was the same person twice that Was a person who had previously been a high-level staff person at Anime Expo or at least as credited as such And thus bring some believability, right?

677
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:04,806
Speaker 1: If you're like, oh I used to be Almost the car the con chair or almost the con chair at other successful convention and now I'm doing this one on my own You sort of want to trust that right.

678
00:47:05,147 --> 00:47:09,842
Speaker 1: but apparently is a case where a person was in that kind of position or claims to Have been.

679
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:13,638
Speaker 1: I think they were and then did two scam cons as far as we can tell.

680
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:14,925
Speaker 0: so Here's the.

681
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:15,470
Speaker 0: here's the rub.

682
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,580
Speaker 0: Like here's the matter not the rub.

683
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,784
Speaker 0: Here's the magic part of this.

684
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:20,393
Speaker 0: you find those kinds of people who might be earnest.

685
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:30,100
Speaker 0: You need to have a staff Who believe in the convention and you guide them into making their own mistakes and being responsible and culpable for those mistakes.

686
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:39,580
Speaker 0: So you get people who have been low-level staff at a bunch of conventions and feel you know You know the people we meet at conventions who feel like it's easy to run a convention because they don't know better.

687
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:41,810
Speaker 0: They've never done the finance of a convention.

688
00:47:42,132 --> 00:47:43,860
Speaker 0: They've never done logistics of a convention.

689
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:47,860
Speaker 0: Then the person like checking badges at the door or scheduling panels.

690
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:59,329
Speaker 1: Well, this is something that not just conventions but I think the world as a whole, you know in all sorts of organizations even just like your families and Companies and all every organization right is.

691
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:03,120
Speaker 1: there are certain things that people at the executive level do.

692
00:48:03,742 --> 00:48:09,860
Speaker 1: Right, if you're in a family only your parents know about like how much money they got in taxes, right?

693
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:19,880
Speaker 1: It's usually money related things but not always You know in a company right when business deals happen between the executives and closed meetings The employees don't know what the fuck goes on in there.

694
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,484
Speaker 1: Right and cut.

695
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:27,020
Speaker 1: at a convention only the people on the board deal with things like insurance and who knows what right?

696
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:38,473
Speaker 1: Yep, and thus people who are not in that top tier of an organization on the executive level Not only don't know about these things that go on right.

697
00:48:38,674 --> 00:48:40,760
Speaker 1: They don't know the details of them.

698
00:48:41,362 --> 00:48:45,820
Speaker 1: They don't even know that they don't know like you don't even know that a convention has to buy insurance.

699
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:55,252
Speaker 0: so you need someone like the director of operations for a convention and You set them up to not get insurance because they're not gonna.

700
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:59,748
Speaker 1: but there's also no way for them to learn unless somebody Specifically brings them in.

701
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:17,380
Speaker 1: and this is why we sort of have like these, you know Like this big gap in our whole society of like people who know the things and how to make them do People who don't because they haven't had someone who knows how the world works Teach them and bring them up and show them all these things that have been hidden from their whole life.

702
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:17,521
Speaker 1: I

703
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:35,592
