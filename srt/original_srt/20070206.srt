1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,318
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday February 6th.

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,368
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:18,030
Speaker 1: tonight We at least nominally talk about video game difficulty.

4
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:20,287
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,281
Speaker 1: Man, I was finally getting things done in my life.

6
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:24,245
Speaker 1: I had free time.

7
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:25,188
Speaker 1: I was reading again.

8
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:25,610
Speaker 1: I got a book.

9
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:28,786
Speaker 1: I'm reading I was my finances were almost all together.

10
00:00:28,826 --> 00:00:36,169
Speaker 1: everything was great And then Scott had to give me the second Phoenix Wright game, haha Phoenix Wright it trumps all.

11
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:37,576
Speaker 1: Yeah, except luckily.

12
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:40,230
Speaker 1: I'll probably done with it by tomorrow, and then I can get back to my real life.

13
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:47,810
Speaker 0: I still got the hotel desk over here But I haven't even started playing it because I'm still playing your stupid portrait of ruin.

14
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:49,698
Speaker 1: Hey, you didn't have to borrow it from me.

15
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:50,983
Speaker 1: That was entirely your decision.

16
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:52,470
Speaker 1: I haven't even beaten that game yet.

17
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:55,120
Speaker 0: It's not as good as the the other cat.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,770
Speaker 0: was that the DS or the first DS dawn of sorrow?

19
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:04,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Donna sorrow is actually my favorite non Simon's Quest Castlevania game so far.

20
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,248
Speaker 0: I know I still got to play some of the other ones.

21
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't really make a judgment because they're just so many of them.

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,567
Speaker 1: I've seen the gameplay and I've talked to people who've played them And I don't think that I think Castlevania DS is pretty much the next logical step in that kind of game.

23
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:27,105
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but your ruin is this parallel dead-end road that Yeah, portrait Owen sort of takes like two steps forward and three steps back.

24
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:36,279
Speaker 0: You know they get rid of some bits I didn't like like the soul collecting and the Drawing on the screen to seal the bosses.

25
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,390
Speaker 1: see I actually kind of like the drawing on the screen to seal the bosses.

26
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,238
Speaker 1: I wish there had been more of that in the game.

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,042
Speaker 0: Well.

28
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,274
Speaker 0: I don't I didn't like the way It was done.

29
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,050
Speaker 0: It could have been used in a better fashion.

30
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,230
Speaker 1: I wish you could have drawn different kinds of seals and done different things and used them outside of just bosses or something.

31
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:56,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that like hey if you pause the game and draw you can draw a seal to do something.

32
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:58,938
Speaker 1: No, not even pause the game real time.

33
00:01:59,058 --> 00:02:04,550
Speaker 0: No that sucks because if I'm drawing a symbol I can't also control the stupid game at the same time.

34
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:09,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what now You know how that wizard felt trying to cast a spell while there's a fighter right there trying to hit him.

35
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,099
Speaker 0: That's right bad, which makes it sucks.

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,824
Speaker 0: No, but I don't know.

37
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:23,904
Speaker 0: I'm probably gonna beat it Right now I'm going back with some facts to get a bunch of arbitrary annoying secrets that there's no way you could possibly know about Without a fact.

38
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:25,266
Speaker 1: yeah I mean cat the fur DS.

39
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:29,025
Speaker 1: I played that one and I found like 90% of the secrets.

40
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,531
Speaker 1: on my own maybe 95.

41
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:32,296
Speaker 0: I found more than 90% of the secrets.

42
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:36,708
Speaker 0: the problem is this stupid quest mechanic where you need that extra 10% of the secrets.

43
00:02:38,352 --> 00:02:40,202
Speaker 1: See I didn't bother once I got the royal sword.

44
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:41,670
Speaker 1: I just stopped doing quests.

45
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:46,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, this guy says you know go fight the dodo, and I'm like where the hell is the dodo.

46
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:50,201
Speaker 0: see now There's no way I could possibly know where the dodo is without cheating.

47
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:58,490
Speaker 1: so you got to think about it like for example You know the Castlevania DS right well the original when you you want to get the Yeti the abominable snowman.

48
00:02:58,831 --> 00:02:59,513
Speaker 0: Yeah, there.

49
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:05,995
Speaker 0: There was actually a little bit of hinting because it's in an area that stood out like a sore thumb This game.

50
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:09,830
Speaker 0: There's a lot of different areas, and you traverse them pretty quickly.

51
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:12,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what they don't really stand out.

52
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,787
Speaker 0: There's a lot of a whole lot of repeating terrain going on.

53
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:21,778
Speaker 1: however I would note that there's actually a lot there and the game's not as Arbitrary as you make it out to be my.

54
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,073
Speaker 0: it's not super arbitrary, but it's pretty Well.

55
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:30,290
Speaker 1: the evidence I put forth is that I lent you the game and aside from bitching about everything else like what do you?

56
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,180
Speaker 1: Mean I have a partner.

57
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:31,890
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

58
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,530
Speaker 0: I knew I had the partner, but I didn't want to have to use the partner which is there.

59
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:39,286
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really want to play that DDR game, but I don't want to move my feet.

60
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:44,684
Speaker 1: That's right but that one quest you know get me some ground beef.

61
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:45,869
Speaker 1: go to the butcher.

62
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:48,649
Speaker 1: and Didn't you just think hey?

63
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:51,101
Speaker 1: I'll go to that place where all that meat was hanging.

64
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,293
Speaker 0: I hadn't been to the place of the meat was hanging Is it?

65
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,430
Speaker 0: go to the butcher shop, and I'm like where is there a butcher shop?

66
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,060
Speaker 0: There's only one shop in this game, and it's right behind you.

67
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,589
Speaker 1: so you got to think a little bit more laterally like oh But your shop hey well There's a butcher shop.

68
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,072
Speaker 0: I think.

69
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:09,990
Speaker 0: basically what it is is the game rewards you if you go slowly and pay lots of attention to it.

70
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,350
Speaker 1: I didn't pay a lot of attention.

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,503
Speaker 1: I Wandered into that room looking for secrets because you know it's a Metroid game.

72
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:20,862
Speaker 1: basically you go everywhere at least once And in that room there is a bunch of meat hanging from sticks.

73
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:22,790
Speaker 1: when I hit that meat it flew around.

74
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:26,485
Speaker 1: It was it was obviously a something here.

75
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:27,690
Speaker 0: I didn't go to that room.

76
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,164
Speaker 0: I never had this swinging meat, so how was I supposed to remember that?

77
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:32,550
Speaker 1: how would you have not gone to that room?

78
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,189
Speaker 0: I didn't I just he turned to the right and said it to the left.

79
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:39,450
Speaker 1: So you completed that whole place and left without going to that one area.

80
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:42,474
Speaker 0: I guess I passed through it But I didn't go it.

81
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,181
Speaker 0: the meat is actually to the left.

82
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,638
Speaker 0: you don't have to go over there to get to the boss Yeah, but if I just burn straight for the boss.

83
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:51,307
Speaker 0: I don't stop and you know poke anything.

84
00:04:51,347 --> 00:04:52,190
Speaker 0: that isn't obvious.

85
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:53,338
Speaker 1: I poke everything.

86
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,628
Speaker 1: I mean that piano.

87
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:59,048
Speaker 1: luckily I looked on game facts right away and DS and found out that the piano doesn't do anything.

88
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:02,966
Speaker 1: otherwise I probably would have sat there for a day playing every single song.

89
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:03,449
Speaker 1: I know.

90
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:08,030
Speaker 0: Meanwhile there's a piano in the stupid in some room somewhere.

91
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:11,550
Speaker 0: I did find a piano, and I found a cross and there's no quest for those yet.

92
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:12,313
Speaker 0: So I'm like.

93
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,865
Speaker 0: I want to know what to do with those, but you didn't give me the quest.

94
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:16,030
Speaker 1: yeah the quest.

95
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:17,310
Speaker 1: I think we're a good idea.

96
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,299
Speaker 1: They just could have been done a lot better than they were.

97
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,082
Speaker 0: it could have been like.

98
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:21,327
Speaker 1: the idea is solid.

99
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,532
Speaker 1: it adds a lot To the game.

100
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:24,739
Speaker 1: it's just the way they did.

101
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:30,259
Speaker 1: you know the quest all come down to have three Particular random items on.

102
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,308
Speaker 0: yeah, that's the owes the ones that really get me.

103
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,079
Speaker 0: right now I have two quests right one one of the quest.

104
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,690
Speaker 0: one of the quest says where the thick glasses.

105
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:38,152
Speaker 0: I'm like.

106
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,490
Speaker 0: I sold the thick glasses before you gave me this quest.

107
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:44,410
Speaker 0: There's no way for me to get the thick glasses again.

108
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:51,910
Speaker 1: Oh see I knew when I got all these items the game I thought I'll bet some of these are gonna be for quest because the quest looked like they were going in that direction.

109
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:54,408
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was just supposed to know.

110
00:05:54,428 --> 00:06:02,982
Speaker 0: yeah It seemed obvious that some random crap item that is worth a lot of money if I sell it But doesn't increase my stats at all is gonna be useful for a quest would.

111
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,149
Speaker 0: never has there been a quest requiring an item.

112
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:09,250
Speaker 1: yet The quest that require items are pretty early on in the list of quests.

113
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:10,418
Speaker 0: I didn't I haven't.

114
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:12,210
Speaker 0: I didn't really done any quests at that point.

115
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,597
Speaker 1: I also like a video game logic.

116
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:21,530
Speaker 0: if you find an item that doesn't appear to have video game logic Hey, this guy is selling items, and there's no way to get money.

117
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,843
Speaker 0: I should sell all these extra useless items.

118
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:25,110
Speaker 1: I've got what are you talking about?

119
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,898
Speaker 1: I'd look practically invented money just from walking around.

120
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,082
Speaker 0: I barely have any money.

121
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,550
Speaker 1: Did you buy healing potions a few?

122
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,655
Speaker 1: That's your problem.

123
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,850
Speaker 0: even so I didn't buy that many.

124
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:37,141
Speaker 0: I mostly use the food that I find lying around.

125
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:38,688
Speaker 1: see I save all the food, too.

126
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:40,816
Speaker 0: How the hell do you heal?

127
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:41,740
Speaker 1: I don't get hit.

128
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,350
Speaker 0: I got you gotta get it sometime now.

129
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:48,070
Speaker 1: I learned how to not get hit and I use my partner to do stuff for me.

130
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:52,263
Speaker 0: I'd use the partner sometimes now But only when I have to and it's really it's.

131
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:54,896
Speaker 0: it's a lot more fun If I just go straight through the game.

132
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:59,395
Speaker 0: if I actually was careful enough to just not get hit instead of burning through the game It wouldn't be worth playing.

133
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,241
Speaker 0: it would take so long.

134
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:03,383
Speaker 1: so you want the game to be easy So you can just burn through it without having to.

135
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:04,390
Speaker 0: I don't want to be easy.

136
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,678
Speaker 0: I just don't want it to take so goddamn long.

137
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:08,224
Speaker 1: It doesn't take that long.

138
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:08,746
Speaker 0: It doesn't?

139
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:09,709
Speaker 0: I burned right through it.

140
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:12,846
Speaker 1: Even if you don't I mean I don't get hit I still burn through.

141
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:12,947
Speaker 1: yeah.

142
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:15,855
Speaker 1: Anyway games not that hard.

143
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,624
Speaker 1: the only annoying part was the sanctuary spell bit.

144
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:20,470
Speaker 0: that was the least annoying part.

145
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:21,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's cuz.

146
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:26,271
Speaker 1: you already read how to do it and listen to me say how I did it unless to everyone else on the Internet.

147
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:29,640
Speaker 0: I think the game just suffers from a few problems.

148
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:33,230
Speaker 1: whatever see I think it suffers from a different set of problems.

149
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:34,676
Speaker 0: There's a lot of problems.

150
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:41,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in the news totally unrelated to, Castlevania It looks like among all the other awesome games that are hitting the Wii.

151
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,822
Speaker 1: We're gonna get Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii.

152
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:45,210
Speaker 0: There's a big surprise.

153
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:46,900
Speaker 1: Actually it kind of was.

154
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,670
Speaker 1: I didn't really expect this.

155
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,014
Speaker 1: I always kind of hoped this.

156
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:55,730
Speaker 1: now my forlorn hope is guitar heroes guitar heroes guitar fucking heroes.

157
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, but just buy a ps2.

158
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:00,110
Speaker 1: yeah, but I want it on the Wii.

159
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:06,350
Speaker 1: I want a guitar that I stick a wiimote into or guitar that just connects bluetooth Lee to the Wii or something awesome like that.

160
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,902
Speaker 0: It's not that much more awesome, I don't want a wire.

161
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:13,230
Speaker 0: the wire on the guitar has never restricted me So it's not a problem.

162
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,944
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I got to deal with the fact that if I were playing a real good as

163
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:17,949
Speaker 0: long as the wire doesn't come out the top of the guitar

164
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,513
Speaker 1: But if I was rocking out on a real guitar There'd be a wire there

165
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:29,355
Speaker 0: at least true and the wire comes out at the same place on the guitar controller that a real guitar Would have the wire coming out.

166
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:29,978
Speaker 0: yeah now.

167
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:37,751
Speaker 1: I'm real hit or miss on this DDR on the Wii because it's not just DDR, and we don't know much about it yet But one.

168
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:44,290
Speaker 1: I get the impression that it's going to be an entirely new soundtrack meaning none of the old good songs.

169
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:45,996
Speaker 0: I hate it when they do that.

170
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:46,739
Speaker 0: They're really just.

171
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,550
Speaker 0: there's really no reason other than the cost of license.

172
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:52,721
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean the primary reason yeah that they don't just.

173
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:59,547
Speaker 0: they put every DDR song Ever in one DDR game all of them will it take multiple discs.

174
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:00,190
Speaker 0: That's fine.

175
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:01,562
Speaker 0: I'll switch them up.

176
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:09,090
Speaker 1: the problem Is that most of those songs were never licensed into America and in fact none of those DDR machines are licensed to be in America.

177
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,578
Speaker 0: They're all here illegally isn't it awesome.

178
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, well recently it seems like they've been accommodating the u.s.

179
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,898
Speaker 1: A lot more, but I remember back in like the fourth mix fifth mix days.

180
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,867
Speaker 1: those machines would before you started.

181
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:26,905
Speaker 1: every time They would say in English this game not licensed for use in America.

182
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:31,218
Speaker 1: You were breaking the law you asshole Yeah, and they expected us to.

183
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,726
Speaker 0: why did they even give us shit?

184
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:38,696
Speaker 1: DDR USA DDR USA was the first DDR machine I ever played on though They are the assholes.

185
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:41,330
Speaker 1: if you ask me that game had like eight songs.

186
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:45,130
Speaker 0: Why are these people pirating our machine?

187
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:50,970
Speaker 0: Maybe it's because we're not supplying their demand is they're not really the problem isn't with Konami?

188
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:55,009
Speaker 1: They know these things are going over to the u.s.. They ship them here.

189
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:57,696
Speaker 1: It's just kind of this time.

190
00:09:57,736 --> 00:10:01,090
Speaker 1: you know the songs aren't licensed to be out in the u.s.

191
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:08,228
Speaker 1: They weren't licensed for use in this way in foreign countries And it would cost so much money to license them that no one's gonna do it.

192
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:13,790
Speaker 1: But if you just get this machine over here, it's all in English anyway.

193
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:19,910
Speaker 1: It's not like you're gonna have a problem and thus DDR just came to America regardless, and it's just kind of a wink and a nudge.

194
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:24,208
Speaker 1: Yep, but also it makes use of the wiimote.

195
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:26,708
Speaker 0: well How do you get where how you can use the wiimote with DDR?

196
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,954
Speaker 1: How do you think you're gonna use the wiimote with DDR?

197
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:31,820
Speaker 1: you're gonna be like left right left left up?

198
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:34,758
Speaker 1: Up up up.

199
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,249
Speaker 1: not forward up, but up up.

200
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:40,829
Speaker 1: It'll do things like it'll show an icon that says shake the wiimote here on the beat.

201
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:51,796
Speaker 1: Now actually this could be cool if one it's optional and every song can be played without it and doesn't suffer from it too if they do it well.

202
00:10:52,097 --> 00:10:56,650
Speaker 1: and three if they do it sparingly or if they only make like special modes where you do it.

203
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,610
Speaker 1: Because some of these multiplayer modes look cool where you've got a bunch of people play.

204
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,396
Speaker 1: There's actually the.

205
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:09,390
Speaker 0: having this in the main mode Would be like having the yelling in Bomberman be part of the main game as opposed to the optional mode.

206
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'd better at least have the salt like.

207
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:16,110
Speaker 1: the song should all have light medium heavy or you know light trick maniac.

208
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:26,219
Speaker 1: And then I don't know wiimote wiimote maniac or some separate whatever thing kind of like with those Extra arrows modes in like fourth mix.

209
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,960
Speaker 0: all they need to do is put the wiimote on and off in this in the secret options menu.

210
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:34,618
Speaker 1: oh The secret options menu that everyone knows about.

211
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:39,449
Speaker 0: that's right a secret options menu that even modern DDR machines Tell you how to get to it.

212
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:48,630
Speaker 1: But I said a bunch of people because the one awesome thing is that this version of DDR looks like it's going to support four Simultaneous players, I think that is the greatest thing about it.

213
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:54,070
Speaker 0: The problem is you're gonna need a sturdy floor to support that or you're gonna have to play in your basement or garage or something.

214
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:54,974
Speaker 0: See the thing is though.

215
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,890
Speaker 1: I've never until now lived in a house that didn't have a sturdy enough floor.

216
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,236
Speaker 0: Well, let's see in colony.

217
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:01,201
Speaker 0: We played in a basement.

218
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:05,739
Speaker 1: Yep, and you know what if we'd lived upstairs We could have played it because those buildings were sturdy.

219
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:06,542
Speaker 0: they were.

220
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:07,606
Speaker 1: I mean, what did it take?

221
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,810
Speaker 1: it took our upstairs neighbors?

222
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,816
Speaker 1: Having a knockdown drag them out.

223
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,405
Speaker 1: They live fight for us to hear them banging around.

224
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:13,987
Speaker 1: Yep.

225
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:17,470
Speaker 1: Oh well Yeah, but I mean my all my houses just seem to do it.

226
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,830
Speaker 1: I can think the house we live in just has really thin floors.

227
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:23,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, well once we get a basement will be actually

228
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:36,509
Speaker 1: you know It probably really doesn't the fact that the living room is one gigantic room with no structural support anywhere in it and Directly above that my bedroom is one giant room of the exact same size with no structural support anywhere in it.

229
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:38,767
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no nothing under.

230
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, cuz if we play in the hallway it works But we're not gonna put a video game system in the hallway.

231
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,526
Speaker 0: That's just or outside.

232
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:48,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, we get ruined.

233
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,267
Speaker 1: We can tilt the TV and put our pads on the back deck and play through the the sliding door.

234
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:55,070
Speaker 0: That's a bad idea.

235
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:56,503
Speaker 1: I might do that in the summer.

236
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:59,036
Speaker 1: You're crazy Of course, I said I might do it last year and I didn't.

237
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:09,970
Speaker 1: but still four players at the same time solves almost every problem I ever had with DDI actually gives home DDR an advantage over arcade DDR and it makes DDR tournaments more efficient.

238
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:12,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, not only that but just the fund.

239
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:21,944
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember when we'd play DDR and with all our friends It'd always be two people playing and you know Two or three other people wanting to play and we'd all have to take turns.

240
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:23,770
Speaker 1: now four people playing at a time.

241
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:26,865
Speaker 1: We a lot more people get to play a lot more people have fun.

242
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:27,529
Speaker 1: We get a lot more DDR.

243
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:37,044
Speaker 0: I mean like if we go to an arcade, it'll be two people over here two people over there when there's multiple machines But four on the same machine is different than two machines with two each.

244
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:38,528
Speaker 0: It's a lot better actually.

245
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:42,660
Speaker 1: if you ask me Yeah, I'd agree it also in terms of yet a bunch of people.

246
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:58,928
Speaker 1: there seems to be a kind of mode where say you You all have to agree on a move like put the wiimote to the right or put the wiimote up and you all have to Do the same move whenever the wiimote icon comes up and I that's why I'd imagine the icon doesn't come up often Or you could turn it off hopefully.

247
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:08,591
Speaker 1: So then you know you all agree on a move and then you know You're doing your dance in unison and then you all have to like point up or point disco in unison Mm-hmm.

248
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:11,295
Speaker 0: if done well, how come DDR?

249
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:14,340
Speaker 0: we can support for remotes at once and Wario where can't?

250
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:23,575
Speaker 1: Because the people who made Wario where are sadistic assholes who run a ruin everything good in the world and Konami is slightly less Sadistic, uh-huh.

251
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:24,299
Speaker 0: All right.

252
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:24,881
Speaker 1: I don't know.

253
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:30,870
Speaker 1: I I have such high hopes for this But I had such high hopes for Wario where and the four player thing looks awesome.

254
00:14:31,393 --> 00:14:45,026
Speaker 1: But I'm leery of this entirely new song set Especially since DDR ninth mix has an amazing song set and also it looks like these Wii dance pads are probably gonna be the same as the GameCube ones.

255
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:50,937
Speaker 0: this demo version They were playing was using the GameCube ports with Mario DDR dance pad.

256
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:56,901
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I can't use a red octane ignition pad There's no reason in the world to ever give this a second.

257
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:57,142
Speaker 1: Look.

258
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:57,664
Speaker 0: Yep.

259
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:01,078
Speaker 0: I mean good God I'm done with those crap pads.

260
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:01,942
Speaker 1: Yeah, how much money.

261
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:03,930
Speaker 1: we probably spent more money on those crap pads.

262
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,340
Speaker 1: We could have just bought hard pad.

263
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,830
Speaker 0: We spent 40 bucks on those things.

264
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,333
Speaker 0: Yeah, 40 bucks one for 20 and then about another one for 20.

265
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:10,734
Speaker 1: We went.

266
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:18,063
Speaker 1: I will our group our group of friends if we include Luke and all them to probably went through Like 20 or 30 of those things in the course of our life.

267
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,093
Speaker 1: that many the whole group Maybe 15.

268
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:23,963
Speaker 1: I went through five.

269
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:25,149
Speaker 0: you didn't go through five.

270
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:25,971
Speaker 1: Yes I did.

271
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:37,210
Speaker 1: cuz I had two pads that I bought that summer after our freshman year when I bought DDR and I wore two of them Out in my house over the course of July and August alone, right?

272
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:44,010
Speaker 1: Yeah And I bought two more before I came to our IT and I wore one out and then you eventually wore mine out.

273
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:45,697
Speaker 1: I repaired two of them.

274
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,629
Speaker 1: In fact, I took a bunch of Luke's busted ones and repaired them.

275
00:15:49,453 --> 00:15:51,766
Speaker 1: Remember I used to cut him open and it wasn't 20 pads.

276
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,835
Speaker 1: I don't know if you count everyone.

277
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,199
Speaker 1: we knew who played DDR.

278
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:56,021
Speaker 0: No.

279
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:56,503
Speaker 0: Yeah.

280
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:59,455
Speaker 0: No, yeah, it's a. it's a bit of exaggeration I don't know.

281
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:00,180
Speaker 1: I might not have been.

282
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:00,785
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

283
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:01,450
Speaker 0: You're crazy.

284
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:03,526
Speaker 0: Anyway, we still used a lot of those things.

285
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,010
Speaker 0: They were cheap.

286
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:07,929
Speaker 0: They were 20 bucks and they disintegrated after a few months of play.

287
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:10,121
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, the thing is they were 20 bucks or more.

288
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:11,890
Speaker 1: give or take plus shipping from eBay.

289
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,860
Speaker 1: That was the only place you could get him at least in those days.

290
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,071
Speaker 0: now every freaking store has one and they're all the same Crap.

291
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:20,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, but really just get an ignition pad.

292
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,700
Speaker 1: There's no reason to use anything else unless you can get a real hard pad Yep, or an arcade machine only 20 grand.

293
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:27,563
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

294
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,187
Speaker 0: Sometimes you can get him for less.

295
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:30,030
Speaker 0: Amazon's got a deal.

296
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:35,470
Speaker 0: So the University of Rochester, hey, isn't that near where we went to school but not where we went to school?

297
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:37,848
Speaker 1: Well, yes in a radio voice it is.

298
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:40,977
Speaker 0: Well, they do actual science there.

299
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:45,810
Speaker 0: Like I remember they did some study about some like light based computing or something?

300
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:46,457
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

301
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:58,730
Speaker 0: but anyway They did a study recently that has been completed where they figured out that playing action video games Specifically unreal tournament can improve your vision.

302
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:01,658
Speaker 0: Now you might think wait a minute.

303
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,644
Speaker 0: That doesn't make sense.

304
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:05,750
Speaker 0: Wouldn't staring at a screen hurt your eyes?

305
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:09,982
Speaker 0: Well, it really doesn't improve your vision in the eye department.

306
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:16,904
Speaker 0: It improves your vision in the brain Department, uh-huh Take that video game haters.

307
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:17,890
Speaker 0: That's right.

308
00:17:18,627 --> 00:17:28,222
Speaker 0: and Apparently what they did is they had some people play Tetris and they had some people play unreal tournament for like an hour a day and they gave him a bunch of eye tests involving standard eye charts.

309
00:17:28,603 --> 00:17:42,014
Speaker 0: this thing where there's two teas and the top tee is upside right and the bottom tee is upside down and there's a tee in the middle and you have to Tell whether the tee in the middle is upside right or upside down and it can trick your eye from distances You know and you won't be able to tell.

310
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:49,760
Speaker 0: and the people who played unreal tournament had much better scores on these tests over time and the people playing Tetris did not.

311
00:17:50,203 --> 00:18:00,869
Speaker 0: uh-huh and They're pretty sure that playing action video games like unreal tournament Trains your brain sort of like exercising the optical parts of your brain.

312
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,470
Speaker 1: I think that's been fairly well known.

313
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:13,630
Speaker 1: I mean there were a lot of studies in the past about you know If they had doctors play certain kinds of video games before they perform surgery They perform the surgeries better or could do surgery that has to do with manual dexterity and such.

314
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,196
Speaker 1: Yeah But all these things in general.

315
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:19,858
Speaker 1: obviously playing video games is not the entirely Passive thing that a lot of people make it out.

316
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:25,890
Speaker 1: to me watching TV is mostly passive But playing a video game you have to interact with the world and solve problems.

317
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:41,329
Speaker 0: yeah, you know you have to use some part of your brain to play a video game even if you're not using your physical muscles so much and Whatever part of the brain you're using is getting some exercise and will probably be improved because of it Even if it is the eye part of the brain.

318
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:48,176
Speaker 1: Yes That part of my brain that tells me that if I find a rooster shaped key I can stick into a rooster shaped hole is Probably gigantic.

319
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:50,670
Speaker 0: oh my god that explains that lump.

320
00:18:57,522 --> 00:19:10,750
Speaker 1: So for anyone who listens to I don't know just Tuesdays or any combination of geek nights nights that does not include Monday I'd recommend you go back and at least watch my thing of the day from yesterday because this week I've thrown down.

321
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,939
Speaker 1: my dukes are up.

322
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:17,359
Speaker 1: I have my own theme week, and we'll see if Scott can top my theme next week.

323
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:21,660
Speaker 0: We'll see I'm coming up with some ideas of a theme for next week.

324
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:36,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, well for those of you also who are unaware my theme this week for various reasons is titled simply Hitler was born to be Alive, I'm sure you all at least hopefully saw yesterday's thing the day Which was in fact Hitler born to be alive?

325
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:37,082
Speaker 1: Tonight.

326
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:39,469
Speaker 1: my thing is something very much related to.

327
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:43,120
Speaker 1: that is a music video done to a techno remix of that song.

328
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:45,128
Speaker 1: However, it is not about Hitler.

329
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,554
Speaker 1: It is about it's not.

330
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:47,779
Speaker 0: I thought that was Hitler's childhood.

331
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:51,780
Speaker 1: Now you know if anything Hitler was that bully.

332
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,787
Speaker 1: Okay now it's one of those cheesy videos.

333
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:04,944
Speaker 1: the best way to describe it is take Napoleon dynamite and Distill it into the plot line that ends with him dancing on stage Mm-hmm.

334
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:14,300
Speaker 1: the plot of this thing of the day is basically Dancing will solve all of your problems and make you awesome And of course I can't believe people need to be taught that lesson.

335
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,660
Speaker 1: I mean, that's the solid truth of life Dancing can solve any problem.

336
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,949
Speaker 1: I mean You know pole pots marching in killing people left and right.

337
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:25,547
Speaker 1: if everyone just come together and gotten down that would have been the end Of pole pot exactly.

338
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:35,693
Speaker 0: Hitler couldn't have done anything against the electric slide Dancing rules and the only people who didn't like disco were people who couldn't dance.

339
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,144
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really wish disco would come back All right.

340
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,013
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this watch this video.

341
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:42,159
Speaker 1: It might seem cheesy.

342
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,504
Speaker 1: Bear with it.

343
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:47,580
Speaker 1: It is worth it for the payoff in the end, especially when the real breakdancers come out.

344
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,870
Speaker 0: Now here is um a thing of the day.

345
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:53,379
Speaker 0: That's kind of scary and kind of weird.

346
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,878
Speaker 0: Uh-huh I don't know if this is from anything.

347
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,120
Speaker 0: It might be from Digimon or one of those types of things that I don't pay attention to.

348
00:21:01,922 --> 00:21:03,809
Speaker 0: It's a DS game holder.

349
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:09,146
Speaker 0: It appears though that it can only hold One DS game.

350
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:13,319
Speaker 0: it might be able to hold more but it appears that it can only hold one.

351
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:16,168
Speaker 1: How much larger is it than a single DS game?

352
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:22,172
Speaker 0: quite larger because it is also some sort of retractable toy sword.

353
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:28,650
Speaker 0: if you look over here Wow It would take up your entire pocket.

354
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,415
Speaker 1: If not more to use a phrase.

355
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,298
Speaker 1: I haven't used in a while.

356
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:38,160
Speaker 0: God damn It comes in two varieties also the blue variety blue and yellow and white and the black and red and white.

357
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:48,260
Speaker 0: The blue yellow and white one says on it wind Liger and there's a picture of what I must assume is the head of a wind liger as opposed to a fire Tigan.

358
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,454
Speaker 0: No, the black and red one says shadow wyvern.

359
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:54,299
Speaker 1: Oh, I like wyverns a lot.

360
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:58,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, um, I don't know who the hell would buy this.

361
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:05,303
Speaker 0: They're much more efficient ways to hold your DS games like altoids tins and What else did that?

362
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:05,705
Speaker 0: actually?

363
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:09,840
Speaker 1: I got to say I'm very happy with the official Nintendo DS caddy.

364
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:16,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it holds all my DS games that I'm playing at the moment very well And I don't carry around all the ones I'm not playing at the moment.

365
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:23,211
Speaker 1: It also has room for DBA games and all that and I got it on sale because the Circuit City lady screwed up and scanned In the wrong barcode.

366
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:24,479
Speaker 0: Ooh awesome.

367
00:22:25,848 --> 00:22:27,614
Speaker 0: Yeah This is just kind of weird.

368
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:28,923
Speaker 0: It's like okay I could understand.

369
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:32,460
Speaker 0: you know, this would be cool if maybe it hold a whole mess of DS games.

370
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,264
Speaker 0: You'd be like, aha.

371
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:35,735
Speaker 0: I hold all my DS games in a toy sword.

372
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:41,756
Speaker 0: Hahaha But I don't know man who the hell would buy this and why I don't get it.

373
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:42,679
Speaker 1: I don't know.

374
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:45,309
Speaker 0: 12 year olds You got to be less than 12 man.

375
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:47,179
Speaker 0: This is for eight year olds that for sure.

376
00:22:48,123 --> 00:23:03,396
Speaker 1: So a while ago I was bitching about a certain point in Castlevania portrait of ruin and then for a conversation happened in the forums which basically led us to a discussion about Video game difficulty and we decided there would probably be a good topic for the show.

377
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:07,760
Speaker 0: Yeah There's a lot of different things to say about video game difficulty.

378
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,673
Speaker 0: I mean like have games really gotten easier over the years?

379
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,100
Speaker 0: have they gotten harder?

380
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:14,024
Speaker 0: You know how?

381
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:22,159
Speaker 0: you know, some video games are harder in different ways than others, you know It's quite more complex than it first appears to be.

382
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:25,149
Speaker 1: Yep And I guess I'll start just to kind of show how that.

383
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:33,420
Speaker 1: I want this conversation to go and also to defend myself Because I didn't really make myself clear when I bitched about that one sanctuary spell thing in portrait of ruin.

384
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:39,660
Speaker 1: The rest of the game was I mean it was difficult as insofar as the game like that can be but it was actually pretty easy.

385
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:57,318
Speaker 1: But the thing is the whole game was one kind of difficulty and then I get to the sanctuary spell and I was suddenly Presented with a entirely different kind of difficulty the likes of which while I could beat I was not prepared for and not really particularly looking forward to deal with.

386
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:07,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think the first thing you gotta examine when looking at the difficulty of any video game is What skill is the game testing?

387
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Lolo is a good example or Lolo one and Lolo two mostly Lolo one are straight-up puzzle games.

388
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:19,120
Speaker 1: They're testing your logical ability to make decisions to solve puzzles to move a little guy around.

389
00:24:19,422 --> 00:24:21,660
Speaker 1: There wasn't so much temporal time-based stuff.

390
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:22,567
Speaker 1: you didn't have to.

391
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:34,003
Speaker 1: I mean there were occasional puzzles where you might have to time something in that you have to run away from something or once you if you put the things right, then you have to run away from the one guy, but it was mostly a Infinite time.

392
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:35,227
Speaker 1: figure the puzzle out game.

393
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,033
Speaker 0: Yep, you figure out the puzzle.

394
00:24:37,173 --> 00:24:40,033
Speaker 0: then as soon as you've figured it out in your brain You've solved it.

395
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:42,649
Speaker 0: Executing it is not a problem.

396
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,754
Speaker 0: You just push the buttons.

397
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:51,568
Speaker 0: It's not hard to push the buttons It's obvious and simple, you know, it's not testing your reflexes Whereas I don't know a fighting game like Street Fighter.

398
00:24:51,989 --> 00:25:02,568
Speaker 0: pretty much just testing your reflexes and reactions and you know Your mastery of manual dexterity of pushing certain buttons and things, you know, there's no puzzle solving There's no sitting and thinking.

399
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,360
Speaker 0: a completely different kind of difficulty.

400
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:06,694
Speaker 1: Now those are both in and of themselves great.

401
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:12,955
Speaker 1: one of the problems I always run into is when a game has one kind of difficulty and I'm going along with it and I like that I'm ready for it.

402
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:23,300
Speaker 1: I know, you know intrinsically how this game is gonna roll and then suddenly out of the blue The game will throw at you a different kind of difficulty that has not had any precedent in the game.

403
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:36,319
Speaker 1: My example is Lolo 3. there were puzzles in Lolo 3 that were somewhat random and time dependent where the only way to beat them was to get like a Randomly moving guy to stop at a specific spot by bumping into him.

404
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:43,910
Speaker 1: So you had to wait and time it and all this timing based stuff that was totally out of place for what was should be just a puzzle solving game.

405
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:49,508
Speaker 1: and While if the game had been that from the start at least I would have known it was common I would have expected it.

406
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:55,159
Speaker 1: I would have dealt with it But it wasn't the kind of difficulty I wanted if I wanted that kind of difficulty I would have played a different game.

407
00:25:55,521 --> 00:26:01,603
Speaker 1: I wanted a puzzle game and that is when I stopped playing Lolo 3 and said fuck this and played Lolo 2 again There.

408
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:05,276
Speaker 0: now there are plenty of games out there that do have multiple kinds of difficulty.

409
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:06,400
Speaker 0: yet do not suck.

410
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:12,892
Speaker 0: Look at something like a Metroid, you know, it's got the exploration Puzzly, how do I get through here?

411
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:13,616
Speaker 0: Where do I go?

412
00:26:13,677 --> 00:26:14,180
Speaker 0: difficulty?

413
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:15,586
Speaker 0: And it also has the shoot.

414
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:22,838
Speaker 0: the bad guy don't get hit difficulty combined at once You know without causing you trouble because you're dealing with both of them all the time.

415
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:24,284
Speaker 0: pretty much Yep, or it's not?

416
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:30,259
Speaker 0: like Metroid is an exploration game and then suddenly at the end of the game There's a terrible boss where you have to shoot really accurately and it sucks.

417
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd be like if I was playing arrowbiz and the games.

418
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:37,440
Speaker 1: just you know I buy on my airplanes and I buy my stock and I talked to my board of directors.

419
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:44,980
Speaker 1: I love that game and then suddenly 9/11 happens and now I'm a fireman in a first-person shooter trying to put out some fires.

420
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:47,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, or what's the game?

421
00:26:47,587 --> 00:26:48,168
Speaker 0: act razor?

422
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:49,432
Speaker 1: Oh my god thing is.

423
00:26:49,752 --> 00:26:51,898
Speaker 1: act razor was a brilliant game.

424
00:26:51,998 --> 00:26:52,600
Speaker 0: It was brilliant.

425
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:54,230
Speaker 1: I mean what genius thought of that.

426
00:26:54,492 --> 00:27:01,556
Speaker 1: they take the kind of game I love build cities and mess with people, you know a minor simple sim game.

427
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:05,148
Speaker 1: add into that Exploration, you know trying to find stuff on the mat.

428
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,840
Speaker 0: add into that side scrolling with the sword Sides going with the sword really doesn't fit.

429
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:13,689
Speaker 1: The thing is it was okay and I enjoyed it.

430
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:22,238
Speaker 1: and I like to act razor a lot both the city thing and the side scrolling even though the side scrolling was really weak compared to the city and the city part was infinitely better.

431
00:27:22,258 --> 00:27:30,100
Speaker 1: and Then when I heard actors at who was coming I thought hot damn They're gonna fix their mistake and make either the side scrolling better or make it just the city.

432
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:35,720
Speaker 1: I don't know if any of you played act razor - but it's literally just the side scrolling and nothing more.

433
00:27:36,162 --> 00:27:36,424
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

434
00:27:37,027 --> 00:27:38,859
Speaker 1: I almost cried when I found that out.

435
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:40,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I didn't know.

436
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:46,111
Speaker 1: I rented the game expecting something awesome And I was so sad because my parents wouldn't let me rent another game.

437
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,737
Speaker 0: Oh, it's terrible.

438
00:27:47,757 --> 00:27:48,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I had it.

439
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,564
Speaker 1: I didn't even play it.

440
00:27:49,845 --> 00:27:50,729
Speaker 1: I just moped around.

441
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:52,355
Speaker 1: I took the game back in three days.

442
00:27:52,376 --> 00:28:02,060
Speaker 0: Oh when I Said no, but you know different skills being tested by the game aren't really a big deal, you know.

443
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:02,401
Speaker 0: It's.

444
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,785
Speaker 0: it's really a matter of preference.

445
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:04,406
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

446
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:05,309
Speaker 0: I like shmups.

447
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:11,343
Speaker 0: I like reactions and dodging and pushing buttons a lot or I like Civilization games.

448
00:28:11,444 --> 00:28:12,528
Speaker 0: I take a lot of time.

449
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,053
Speaker 0: I think about stuff and I met.

450
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:19,310
Speaker 0: I micromanage a lot of things, you know And it's basically what type of skill are you good at?

451
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:22,560
Speaker 0: What do you like doing is not really a big difference?

452
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,757
Speaker 0: You know some things are obviously harder for some people.

453
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:25,060
Speaker 0: none of this.

454
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,278
Speaker 0: My mom can't play a fighting game, but my mom can probably play Wario where yep or a case in point.

455
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,600
Speaker 1: I Suck at shmups as Scott can attest if we're Scott's plan is small.

456
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,255
Speaker 0: I also suck compared to the awesome people, but I play them enough that I'm pretty good.

457
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:39,420
Speaker 1: I stuck compared to Scott.

458
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,424
Speaker 1: I never even beat Gradius 3.

459
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:47,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm in that class of shmup players where you know, I have the standard set of you know.

460
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:56,731
Speaker 0: But as soon as the game, you know Ramps up, you know, I have to start memorizing and such.

461
00:28:56,992 --> 00:29:04,853
Speaker 1: but yet at the same time Scott can't play those Gemfire style bunch of numbers on the board moving troops around.

462
00:29:05,154 --> 00:29:07,520
Speaker 0: that's just cuz I I probably could play them.

463
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:08,022
Speaker 0: It's just.

464
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:12,440
Speaker 0: I really don't like reading all those numbers and I really just I don't want to had to pay attention to them.

465
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,867
Speaker 0: I ignore them and I just want it to be Deal with it.

466
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:16,838
Speaker 1: What do you want it to be?

467
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:18,309
Speaker 1: Different game.

468
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:23,516
Speaker 1: I don't like those games like Gemfire would be a lot better if it was actually Mario World.

469
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:24,220
Speaker 0: That's right.

470
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:26,328
Speaker 0: It would be because Mario World is awesome.

471
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,191
Speaker 0: Jetfire sucks.

472
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:32,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got you to play arrowbiz a couple times though Though you hate it every second I barely fit the only numbers.

473
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:34,073
Speaker 0: I paid attention to an arrow biz where.

474
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:35,880
Speaker 0: how much is it gonna cost me to do this?

475
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,527
Speaker 0: And how much money?

476
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:37,339
Speaker 0: money get from it?

477
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:45,436
Speaker 1: And that's why your airline went out of business and the Philippines went underserved For a number of years before I finally stepped in with cheap affordable air travel.

478
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:50,772
Speaker 1: Yeah This is more rim talks about arrowbiz than anything.

479
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:55,808
Speaker 0: All right, so Obviously, whatever skill a game tests.

480
00:29:56,109 --> 00:30:05,292
Speaker 0: Sometimes it tests it more, you know, for example, let's see Gradius one is a relatively easy shmup game.

481
00:30:05,332 --> 00:30:07,540
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not the easiest but it's pretty easy.

482
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,609
Speaker 0: Ikaruga is quite a bit more difficult.

483
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:11,733
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Ikaruga is.

484
00:30:11,813 --> 00:30:13,740
Speaker 1: I mean Dave from Dave and Joel's said this.

485
00:30:13,821 --> 00:30:14,728
Speaker 1: I kind of agree with this.

486
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:18,006
Speaker 1: It's almost not a shmup It's like this other class of game.

487
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:22,440
Speaker 0: it is because it does sort of test your memory more than it tests your shmup abilities.

488
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:30,278
Speaker 1: Water that down with sort of Ikaruga is DDR for your fingers Kind of but I don't know.

489
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,956
Speaker 0: G Darius is more difficult than Gradius one, you know.

490
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:35,860
Speaker 0: or our type.

491
00:30:36,462 --> 00:30:39,110
Speaker 0: Our type is more difficult than Gradius tends to be.

492
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,016
Speaker 1: it will depends on VR type and it's a.

493
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:43,664
Speaker 0: our type 3 is more Difficult than Gradius 3.

494
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:44,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll agree with that.

495
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:48,967
Speaker 0: Well Gradius 3 was pretty but they're both testing the same skill set Yeah, you know.

496
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:52,480
Speaker 0: or Mortal Kombat No, I don't know if that's more difficult.

497
00:30:52,500 --> 00:31:08,460
Speaker 1: I guess it's just the only thing that bothers me when it comes to that is when a game tests a skill out of place Or out of character for the game or in a way that is annoying or you know Anything like that any game that just knocks you for a loop and it isn't an interesting loop

498
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:09,623
Speaker 0: Of

499
00:31:11,187 --> 00:31:12,570
Speaker 1: course, then there's all the different class.

500
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,970
Speaker 1: I mean you might hear this phrase from pretty much people our age like our whole generation.

501
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:21,242
Speaker 1: Nintendo hard and that doesn't really apply to modern games.

502
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:24,070
Speaker 1: It really only applies to NES and SNES games.

503
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:26,637
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean back in the day.

504
00:31:26,657 --> 00:31:30,250
Speaker 0: It wasn't just the games, you know were difficult.

505
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:31,899
Speaker 0: I mean there are some difficult games now.

506
00:31:32,362 --> 00:31:34,834
Speaker 0: It was that games Punished you.

507
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:38,888
Speaker 0: you had to start over all the time like Ninja Gaiden.

508
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:40,436
Speaker 0: All right It's a Ninja Gaiden.

509
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,387
Speaker 0: you play level 1 you play level 2.

510
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:42,850
Speaker 0: It's like dude.

511
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,790
Speaker 0: I got to level 3 and then I died.

512
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,751
Speaker 0: Well now back at level 1 again you would.

513
00:31:46,792 --> 00:32:07,578
Speaker 0: you had to basically had to master the game from beginning to end and you played the beginning parts a bajillion times and The end parts you only played once or twice because you hardly ever got there Whereas nowadays you play all parts of a game equally and the difficulty gradually increases instead of being constantly Killing you all over the place.

514
00:32:07,699 --> 00:32:09,830
Speaker 1: Not only that but it seems like a lot of modern games.

515
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:16,070
Speaker 1: I'm not saying this is a good or a bad thing But there's been a shift toward this idea that completing the game is a foregone conclusion.

516
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:19,770
Speaker 1: Like you play even Super Mario World had this not not problem?

517
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:35,910
Speaker 1: I don't want to call it a problem but this idea where you basically have infinite lives infinite continue Whatever you can just keep playing forever and you're eventually gonna beat the game if you put in the requisite effort in time And there's no worry of am I gonna beat it or am I going to fail?

518
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,008
Speaker 1: The only way to fail is to just stop playing the game.

519
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:44,670
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean your skill does have to increase in order to beat the game because the later levels are harder than the earlier levels.

520
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:54,590
Speaker 0: But you're not forced to play the early levels over and over again and master beating them You know in a shorter and shorter amount of time and getting you know.

521
00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:03,750
Speaker 0: No one cares if you get more points when you beat the game or no one cares if you beat the game better or Faster than anyone else except for people who go for the speed runs.

522
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,470
Speaker 0: But those guys are using machines and not they're doing it themselves.

523
00:33:06,832 --> 00:33:09,264
Speaker 1: Well, no remember a lot of speedrunners try to do it themselves.

524
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:11,997
Speaker 0: some of them some of them I think they actually have like.

525
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:14,670
Speaker 1: they call those other things machine assisted or tool assisted.

526
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:17,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of the ones I see your machine is I don't care.

527
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,427
Speaker 1: I just want you know why because the ones where people do them usually aren't interesting.

528
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:20,990
Speaker 0: That's right.

529
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:24,410
Speaker 0: It's not interesting to watch they're just interesting to give respect to the person.

530
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:28,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I remember watching those two guys race in Mario 1. that was fantastic.

531
00:33:29,172 --> 00:33:34,850
Speaker 0: But as a result of these games that you know pretty much assume that you're going to beat it sort of like watching a movie.

532
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,349
Speaker 0: You're assumed to see the ending at some point.

533
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,454
Speaker 0: You know it.

534
00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:43,567
Speaker 0: just the games don't punish you they just keep letting you play.

535
00:33:43,748 --> 00:33:52,350
Speaker 1: so as a result It's weird that like Princess Peach Near the end of the game like say you screw up a boss or something and you die You just keep trying it again and again and again again.

536
00:33:53,012 --> 00:33:55,539
Speaker 1: So there's no kind of penalty for dying.

537
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:01,728
Speaker 1: so you can almost brute force the game all the way through and just keep playing keep playing just keep playing and you're gonna win.

538
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,279
Speaker 0: and Also unless you're really dumb.

539
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:06,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to be really dumb.

540
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,029
Speaker 1: The other interesting thing is that this kind of takes away one aspect of old games, which was that?

541
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:18,170
Speaker 1: Magical mystery of getting too hard to get places or rare places or weird places.

542
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:22,496
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I mean in Mario World, right I can go to any level I want at any time.

543
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:25,913
Speaker 0: getting to the star world is no big deal because I Can you know.

544
00:34:25,993 --> 00:34:27,620
Speaker 0: once I find out where it is I can go there.

545
00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:29,670
Speaker 0: but imagine if you played a game?

546
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,800
Speaker 0: straight through from beginning to end with no saving or stopping.

547
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,020
Speaker 0: you would have to know where the star world is and you might only Have like a very small chance of getting it.

548
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:42,820
Speaker 0: and if you get it, holy crap like Mario 3 I was just about to bring you get the white ship.

549
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:43,885
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

550
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:45,050
Speaker 0: You got the white ship.

551
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,973
Speaker 0: You know hard that is.

552
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:55,670
Speaker 0: you only get one chance at it like per world and you have to get a whole bunch of coins In a very small amount of time and under very extremely strict circumstances.

553
00:34:55,891 --> 00:34:59,290
Speaker 0: And if you mess up the only way is to start the whole game over again.

554
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,115
Speaker 0: There's no saving.

555
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:12,742
Speaker 1: I mean early on before I knew where all the warp whistles were I'd get to that giant world or you know world 5 and the castle in the sky and I would just spend time like Marveling at this strange place that I so rarely get to see.

556
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:18,924
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty freakin awesome And nowadays you don't really appreciate it because you don't.

557
00:35:19,064 --> 00:35:20,510
Speaker 0: the games aren't the same way they used to be.

558
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:27,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's definitely a different vibe like nowadays you beat a game and it's like well I have finished my 60 hours into this game or whatever.

559
00:35:27,724 --> 00:35:28,206
Speaker 1: and it's not.

560
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:35,530
Speaker 1: I never feel this That sense of awe that I used to feel when I was a kid and I beat Zelda for the first time.

561
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:39,762
Speaker 1: I called all my friends and I went crazy nuts.

562
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:41,988
Speaker 1: and I I was as a kid.

563
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:43,399
Speaker 1: if you saw me I was just this blur.

564
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:48,608
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I beat Zelda And tell the head saving and it's still crazy.

565
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:56,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the other Thing you had to notice when talking about game difficulty is not just.

566
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:03,976
Speaker 0: you know It's good when a game tests a skill and then gives you harder challenges of that skill, you know We're gonna test your reflexes.

567
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:04,939
Speaker 0: Okay for this part.

568
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:07,850
Speaker 0: You're gonna need faster reflexes than you needed in the previous part.

569
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:12,969
Speaker 1: Now you're gonna need even faster reef or now you're gonna react to something that's gonna be harder to react to.

570
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:23,702
Speaker 0: Yeah you're gonna have to have more precise controls or enter a more complicated button combination or you're gonna have to solve a Puzzle that has more parts and might take you a longer time to figure out.

571
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:24,846
Speaker 0: that's all good.

572
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:25,930
Speaker 0: In fact, that's expected.

573
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:30,590
Speaker 0: What's not expected is the big no-nos of game difficulty?

574
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:35,105
Speaker 0: The number one no-no is arbitrariness.

575
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:44,222
Speaker 1: now I don't want to bash crystal chronicles because Final Fantasy crystal chronicles provided to me Perhaps my greatest gaming experience ever.

576
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:45,507
Speaker 0: I don't want to go that far but it was.

577
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:46,933
Speaker 0: we had a good time I don't know.

578
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:50,937
Speaker 1: all told it's definitely in the top five of Total gaming experiences.

579
00:36:50,957 --> 00:36:55,803
Speaker 1: if you take that entire weekend and count it as one experience It was a great weekend and I'll leave it at that.

580
00:36:55,823 --> 00:36:58,174
Speaker 0: I don't know top five Weekend to be remembered.

581
00:36:58,275 --> 00:36:59,600
Speaker 1: you gotta admit top ten.

582
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:00,744
Speaker 0: Um, I don't know.

583
00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:02,389
Speaker 1: I think so.

584
00:37:03,152 --> 00:37:07,224
Speaker 1: Anyway, but crystal chronicles the game was mad, but we played it in a way that made it.

585
00:37:07,364 --> 00:37:07,665
Speaker 1: Awesome.

586
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:08,468
Speaker 0: That's about.

587
00:37:08,488 --> 00:37:09,190
Speaker 0: that's pretty accurate.

588
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,154
Speaker 1: Oh, I'll agree with that.

589
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:11,540
Speaker 1: The game itself wasn't so great.

590
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,710
Speaker 1: The idea behind it was so solid though.

591
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,721
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, okay, just so people know.

592
00:37:15,822 --> 00:37:25,608
Speaker 0: when crystal chronicles came out We had four people me rim Pete and katsu and we spent an entire weekend And we only took breaks for sleeping and eating.

593
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:32,670
Speaker 1: yeah And by sleeping we basically fell asleep at the game and died and then we slept for like four hours six hours.

594
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:41,239
Speaker 0: Then we tried to all reconvene and started playing again and we beat the game from beginning to end in as short a time as we Possibly could in one straight.

595
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:44,170
Speaker 0: go of it with four people for Gameboy advances.

596
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:46,959
Speaker 1: We started early in the morning on Saturday.

597
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,164
Speaker 1: We played straight.

598
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,308
Speaker 0: I thought we played Friday night.

599
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:50,010
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

600
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:50,834
Speaker 0: I don't remember either.

601
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:54,130
Speaker 1: are we started as soon as we could all get off of work in class.

602
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:55,715
Speaker 1: We played straight through.

603
00:37:56,116 --> 00:38:00,810
Speaker 1: we stopped briefly to go to a hockey game that I was so tired at from playing this game.

604
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,858
Speaker 0: I didn't remember going to that hockey game.

605
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,325
Speaker 1: I could barely yell.

606
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:09,342
Speaker 1: I was just sitting there like Gotta heal life life and conscious like river not playing.

607
00:38:09,382 --> 00:38:11,309
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh but life.

608
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:16,410
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, so that's enough of that store.

609
00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:17,574
Speaker 0: That's why crystal.

610
00:38:17,614 --> 00:38:25,109
Speaker 0: that's why we have a higher opinion of crystal chronicles and other people is because we set up an interesting scenario For ourselves to play it outside of the game.

611
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,381
Speaker 1: But if and the game was really beautiful atmospheric and whatever.

612
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:30,849
Speaker 1: but yeah the game had all these side quests.

613
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,200
Speaker 1: now Here's the problem one.

614
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,070
Speaker 1: I Didn't even know the side quests were finishable.

615
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:42,740
Speaker 1: The game did not actually let you in on that secret that you could finish these side quests - they were so arbitrary.

616
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,680
Speaker 1: It was like talk to this guy go back to this village talk to this guy.

617
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,577
Speaker 1: But it wasn't like someone would say you should go back to the village of blah and talk to blah.

618
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:52,480
Speaker 0: see Zelda games.

619
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:57,380
Speaker 0: The reason Zelda games are so great and enjoyable is because they completely lack arbitrariness.

620
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:01,012
Speaker 0: Some guy will say take this to error and you go.

621
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:02,216
Speaker 0: Hey, there was a guy before.

622
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,357
Speaker 0: he said I am error I'll go give this to error and you do.

623
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:12,180
Speaker 0: Imagine if there was just an item somewhere in the forest you picked it up and it was like the rare item, right?

624
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:15,060
Speaker 0: And there was a guy in town and he said I am error.

625
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:19,760
Speaker 0: There's no way to know that you have to give that item to error to get some secret weapon.

626
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:22,880
Speaker 0: There's no possible way you can ever know outside of a fact.

627
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:27,175
Speaker 0: Yet if you give that item to error you get a secret weapon.

628
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:33,313
Speaker 1: now look that is Arbitrary, there aren't that many games that are that arbitrary and usually there's something.

629
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:40,360
Speaker 1: a lot of times someone will say something arbitrary But it just meant that they actually weren't paying attention to the game, but there are sometimes yeah, it depends.

630
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:48,460
Speaker 1: But crystal chronicles like you talk to a girl like oh dear the princess is missing and I thought great I can save the princess and I talked to him again.

631
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,640
Speaker 1: He says oh dear the princess is missing and I talked to the next person.

632
00:39:53,102 --> 00:40:00,876
Speaker 1: Oh, no, the princess is missing and apparently I could have saved the princess But I had no way of knowing how and I read game facts.

633
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:01,720
Speaker 1: It was just stupid.

634
00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:09,080
Speaker 0: I think my favorite example of arbitrariness in video games is ogre battle 64. someone you never you never played it.

635
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:10,428
Speaker 1: I knew not to my.

636
00:40:10,548 --> 00:40:33,079
Speaker 0: I played it a little bit and my brother owned it and I don't remember if he ever beat it, but apparently he got the Strategy guide at one point and I looked through it for a bit and there was a little sidebar about how to get like these most powerful angel paladin characters or whatever right and Apparently you had to go to this town on a map on a certain date in the year at a certain time.

637
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,300
Speaker 0: now the game Had a built-in calendar and clock and talk to a certain person and give him a certain item.

638
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:40,749
Speaker 1: I was like how the hell are you supposed to know that?

639
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,840
Speaker 0: there's no way to know that no one will ever tell.

640
00:40:44,564 --> 00:40:46,939
Speaker 0: it's impossible to know that without the strategy guide.

641
00:40:46,959 --> 00:41:02,491
Speaker 0: and While there are very few games that are as arbitrary as that I have noticed an increasing level of arbitrariness over the years And I don't know if I want to say there's a conspiracy to sell strategy guides But there might be a conspiracy to sell strategy guides.

642
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:04,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean even old games.

643
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,464
Speaker 1: It wasn't like that.

644
00:41:05,544 --> 00:41:10,044
Speaker 1: strategy guides were just this awesome thing that you got after you beat the game Just because it was cool.

645
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:12,255
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I got that Mario 3 strategy guide.

646
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:13,782
Speaker 0: I didn't even ask for it I just got.

647
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:15,992
Speaker 1: I remember how Nintendo parties gave it to you.

648
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,484
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't have Nintendo power really I don't know.

649
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:23,892
Speaker 0: Anyway, I would look at it and go holy crap There's all the levels I didn't go to and there's secrets in the levels.

650
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:25,620
Speaker 0: It was just cool to see all the maps.

651
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,703
Speaker 1: Yeah, it also had all this.

652
00:41:26,743 --> 00:41:28,127
Speaker 1: like the history of Mario.

653
00:41:28,428 --> 00:41:32,119
Speaker 1: here are all the death icon animations from all the different Mario games.

654
00:41:32,644 --> 00:41:33,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know it was fun.

655
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:35,785
Speaker 0: Now the strategy guides.

656
00:41:35,846 --> 00:41:45,874
Speaker 0: a lot of games make them sort of necessary like here's the where the secret is with the awesome weapon You couldn't possibly ever know about without buying the strategy guide or reading game facts and that sucks.

657
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:58,900
Speaker 1: That's a bad game design right there I mean granted that's not to totally give a pass to a lot of the old games that weren't arbitrary But they suffered from video game logic to the degree that you know, there's hard and there's Nintendo hard.

658
00:41:59,422 --> 00:42:02,291
Speaker 1: I would say there's a video game logic and there's Nintendo logic.

659
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:04,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there are different levels of arbitrariness.

660
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:10,780
Speaker 0: I mean you could be completely arbitrary like the example I just gave with error, which isn't you know.

661
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:19,591
Speaker 0: But you can be sort of arbitrary like there's one guy who gives you a very vague hint at something But there's no way to know exactly.

662
00:42:19,692 --> 00:42:21,240
Speaker 0: you could say well the guy gave you a hint.

663
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,369
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but it wasn't enough of a hint, you know, it is.

664
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:31,847
Speaker 0: there's a point at which it's not arbitrary, but it's still Unreasonably unknowable without a strategy guide.

665
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:46,033
Speaker 1: I think the line for me the in terms of figuring stuff like that out the Absolute bare end line of arbitrariness is most exemplified in Castlevania 2 Simon's Quest which also happens to be one of my favorite games ever.

666
00:42:46,053 --> 00:42:46,835
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

667
00:42:47,377 --> 00:42:48,580
Speaker 1: That's an unpopular opinion.

668
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:50,252
Speaker 1: I know you can all die in a fire.

669
00:42:50,272 --> 00:42:55,186
Speaker 1: Castlevania 2 was great But anyway the game like what to get?

670
00:42:55,287 --> 00:43:05,344
Speaker 1: some things like you have to take Dracula's heart and Go to this as dead end somewhere and kneel down for five seconds and then a whirlwind will appear Like what's the fuck?

671
00:43:05,705 --> 00:43:07,671
Speaker 1: and all sorts of weird stuff like that.

672
00:43:08,273 --> 00:43:23,689
Speaker 1: and you know to get Dracula's body parts you have to go to these orbs and stab them with steaks that you can buy from scary old dudes and All that stuff while it seems really weird and arbitrary like hit your head on this rock a bunch of times and something will fall out of it like randomly in one part of the game.

673
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:31,300
Speaker 1: if You talk to the people in town They basically tell you all of this and you can figure it all out logically if you just pay attention.

674
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:39,818
Speaker 0: Yeah, effects an ado is the same way, you know There's a lot of weird stuff in that game But people in town tell you everything you need to know right up until the end.

675
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:43,331
Speaker 1: Yep It'll be like go pray at the blah Cemetery.

676
00:43:43,732 --> 00:43:45,960
Speaker 1: All right, so I go to that Cemetery nothing there.

677
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,811
Speaker 1: So then I kneel down and wait a bit and then oh something happens.

678
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:49,514
Speaker 1: Hooray.

679
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:55,555
Speaker 1: I'm smarter than a video game Yep, and the other one Final Fantasy 1 which isn't.

680
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:57,120
Speaker 1: it isn't really arbitrary at all.

681
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,620
Speaker 1: It's the same idea though near the end of the game.

682
00:43:59,664 --> 00:44:10,779
Speaker 1: I mean I know most of you if you played Final Fantasy 1 either played the GBA one or played it with a fag or with that Awesome strategy guide that Nintendo put out that tells you what's in every chest and everything.

683
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:19,255
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy 1. at the end of the game you beat all four fiends Spoilers, by the way, and you got all four crystals.

684
00:44:19,315 --> 00:44:20,640
Speaker 1: and that's supposed to fix the world.

685
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,920
Speaker 1: You know the earth is rotting and you've solved this.

686
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,868
Speaker 1: You've got the four crystals like everyone said.

687
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,540
Speaker 1: you figured out what happened to the warriors of the sky.

688
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:28,849
Speaker 0: Everything's great.

689
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:34,294
Speaker 1: You're done But the game doesn't end and you go around and people say things like huh?

690
00:44:34,836 --> 00:44:36,120
Speaker 1: How come the world's still shitty?

691
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:36,882
Speaker 1: Why?

692
00:44:36,922 --> 00:44:37,725
Speaker 0: what's going on, you know?

693
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:40,012
Speaker 0: walking around the world in Final Fantasy 1?

694
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:42,360
Speaker 0: It's not so shitty except for the monsters everywhere.

695
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,900
Speaker 1: Well now until you go underground and the world is just like this marsh poison filled death cave.

696
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:56,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean most of the towns the big towns on the surface or they're nice You know, even let's see what's going on lefty.

697
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,439
Speaker 1: Well, we know the story of what happened to them.

698
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:01,070
Speaker 0: The pirate town is nice except for the pirates.

699
00:45:01,271 --> 00:45:02,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is actually?

700
00:45:02,396 --> 00:45:03,320
Speaker 0: the pirates make it nicer.

701
00:45:03,502 --> 00:45:07,489
Speaker 1: yeah, it was shitty and you save that town and God that there's that other town.

702
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:08,454
Speaker 1: No, I don't need a.

703
00:45:08,474 --> 00:45:09,279
Speaker 0: pirates were making it.

704
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:11,351
Speaker 0: Nice You make it worse when you get rid of the pirates.

705
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:16,880
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright, alright all the buildings are hollowed out and empty.

706
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,968
Speaker 0: That's just cuz you can see through the roof.

707
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,120
Speaker 1: also because there aren't any shops you can go into in those buildings.

708
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:22,785
Speaker 1: They're just empty.

709
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:23,873
Speaker 1: but yeah, you can walk into them.

710
00:45:23,893 --> 00:45:29,600
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but you go to Melmond and it's been totally destroyed by that vampire and you know bad stuff.

711
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:30,999
Speaker 1: So you've you've fixed it.

712
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,191
Speaker 1: You've got all the orbs and the rod is still happening.

713
00:45:34,592 --> 00:45:38,516
Speaker 1: all the the world is still decaying and you're like What do I do now and no one can tell you?

714
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:50,244
Speaker 1: Well, if you'd paid attention in the game and you put all the clues together And there's so many clues all over the place that point to the actual plot and the thing is it's not exactly obvious.

715
00:45:50,285 --> 00:46:16,550
Speaker 1: if you didn't read a strategy guide and I remember when I was playing Final Fantasy 1 and I wasn't sure where to Go and I'm wandering around and eventually I go back up into the sky tower just to loot it And I go back to that window because in the sky tower there's this window and you can look down from this from space basically and see the earth and I look down and I actually read that flavor text and it says something along the lines of blah blah blah the swirling vortices of the forces of the world.

716
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:22,668
Speaker 1: you almost get the sense that they're converging at the center of Their being or something like that.

717
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:24,799
Speaker 1: So then I'm thinking yeah, huh?

718
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:26,472
Speaker 1: So I cast the spell.

719
00:46:26,553 --> 00:46:32,000
Speaker 1: I learned, you know Push B select to get the world met and I'm looking at it and I noticed something interesting.

720
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:43,634
Speaker 1: the four temples where the four evil things were and where the four orbs were are in a perfect square and Exactly at the center of that square is the temple of fucking fiends.

721
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:49,219
Speaker 1: from the very first part of the game Yeah, so I marched my ass over there and that's where everything happens.

722
00:46:49,622 --> 00:46:51,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that wasn't arbitrary at all.

723
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,793
Speaker 1: That was just awesomely difficult and it required paying attention.

724
00:46:55,953 --> 00:46:57,860
Speaker 1: and you know all the stuff that I like in an RPG.

725
00:46:58,602 --> 00:47:02,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know there is another kind of difficulty that sucks.

726
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:07,464
Speaker 0: besides just arbitrariness and I guess it's sort of related is Unreasonable difficulty.

727
00:47:07,544 --> 00:47:08,327
Speaker 1: how Silver Surfer?

728
00:47:08,668 --> 00:47:09,591
Speaker 1: Yeah Silver Surfer.

729
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:16,100
Speaker 0: Yeah Silver Surfer Friday the 13th not arbitrary It's a game of you know reflexes and moving the Silver Surfer.

730
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,010
Speaker 0: It's a shoot-em-up aside scrolling and also up scrolling shoot-em-up.

731
00:47:19,452 --> 00:47:21,700
Speaker 0: The thing is you die in one hit.

732
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:26,674
Speaker 0: Also, the Silver Surfer is slow and he does not shoot rapidly.

733
00:47:27,236 --> 00:47:33,935
Speaker 0: bad guys are hard to kill Even grazing slightly grazing any part of the map, you know any terrain.

734
00:47:33,995 --> 00:47:35,660
Speaker 0: anything solid will kill you instantly.

735
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,599
Speaker 0: You don't have that many lives.

736
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:41,574
Speaker 0: There's no continues in order to beat it you.

737
00:47:41,795 --> 00:47:49,060
Speaker 0: if the game is beatable The thing is in order to beat any of it your level of skill has to be so ludicrously high.

738
00:47:49,343 --> 00:47:53,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you that it's essentially Impossible if you say you just play this game.

739
00:47:53,968 --> 00:47:57,260
Speaker 1: I remember every time I tried decided you know what I'm gonna be a badass.

740
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:03,860
Speaker 1: I'm gonna beat the Silver Surfer and I sat down and I started playing and I died in eight seconds.

741
00:48:04,522 --> 00:48:07,171
Speaker 1: I tried again died in eight seconds tried again.

742
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:09,097
Speaker 1: I made it like three more seconds.

743
00:48:09,398 --> 00:48:09,940
Speaker 1: I tried again.

744
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,330
Speaker 1: I died in four seconds because I wasn't paying attention.

745
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,600
Speaker 1: It's just there's no fucking way.

746
00:48:15,282 --> 00:48:15,724
Speaker 1: What are they?

747
00:48:15,924 --> 00:48:19,637
Speaker 1: that game was marketed at me when I was you know that age when it came out.

748
00:48:19,677 --> 00:48:21,142
Speaker 1: I was like 12.

749
00:48:21,142 --> 00:48:23,270
Speaker 1: That game a 12 year old can't beat that game.

750
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's not arbitrary.

751
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:27,364
Speaker 0: It's not like you need.

752
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:35,872
Speaker 0: there is some fact that can provide you with some information that you didn't know and suddenly the whole game Is easy or oh, that's how it's done.

753
00:48:35,932 --> 00:48:40,988
Speaker 0: If I only would have known that piece of information There was no way I could have known, you know, the game is beatable.

754
00:48:41,089 --> 00:48:47,688
Speaker 0: No, you just need to have a level of reflexes and Memorization of where everything is in the game.

755
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,905
Speaker 0: That is beyond any It's just not.

756
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:52,831
Speaker 0: there's no point.

757
00:48:53,575 --> 00:48:54,219
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

758
00:48:54,602 --> 00:48:56,878
Speaker 1: I've never met a human being who can beat Silver Surfer.

759
00:48:57,224 --> 00:48:58,684
Speaker 0: I Remember when I was a kid.

760
00:48:58,925 --> 00:49:01,436
Speaker 0: the kid down the street actually had the game and he could get.

761
00:49:01,577 --> 00:49:08,457
Speaker 0: I think he could beat a few levels maybe but that's about it and I'm sure if I saved and loaded with an emulator I could get pretty far.

762
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:14,300
Speaker 0: the problem is I might accidentally save and then in a spot where I'm dead no matter what.

763
00:49:14,903 --> 00:49:17,220
Speaker 0: So I'd have to do it like segment by segment.

764
00:49:18,362 --> 00:49:23,220
Speaker 0: I'd only be able to save in a situation where I'm guaranteed not to die within two seconds.

765
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:28,840
Speaker 1: I decided to beat Castlevania 2 just while I was bored one day back when I was living alone in the mountains.

766
00:49:29,423 --> 00:49:34,180
Speaker 1: So I just had one save slot in the emulator and I just you know Saved the state whenever I wanted to take a break.

767
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,700
Speaker 0: So you saved it when you're about to fall into a pit and then every time you loaded you fell in a pit.

768
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:43,819
Speaker 1: Well, I was walking and then I was cooking some dinner and I was just you know Running around fighting and I heard the thing go off for food.

769
00:49:44,121 --> 00:49:48,120
Speaker 1: So I just turned to hit f5, you know save my state and I walk over to get my food.

770
00:49:48,783 --> 00:49:52,160
Speaker 1: I walk back over to the game and I see that my character is dead.

771
00:49:52,241 --> 00:50:02,672
Speaker 1: I think okay, whatever if I got pushed off the ledge I hit f7 to restore my state and there's a fireball Right there hit about to hit me and it hits me and knocks me in and I died.

772
00:50:02,692 --> 00:50:03,475
Speaker 1: It was my last life.

773
00:50:04,237 --> 00:50:09,035
Speaker 1: Ah, I Determined empirically that there was no way out of that situation.

774
00:50:09,055 --> 00:50:11,470
Speaker 1: So I Sucked it up.

775
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:12,180
Speaker 1: I had to continue.

776
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:23,471
Speaker 0: I guess there's one other kind of difficulty I just touch on quickly and that's not the difficulty of skill but the difficulty of effort, you know For example World of Warcraft where it's not hard.

777
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,218
Speaker 0: Anyone can do it, but that's not effort.

778
00:50:25,258 --> 00:50:25,840
Speaker 1: That's just time.

779
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:26,342
Speaker 0: It is it.

780
00:50:26,805 --> 00:50:28,935
Speaker 0: that time is effort, you know, you have to work.

781
00:50:29,056 --> 00:50:29,780
Speaker 0: It's not hard.

782
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:31,445
Speaker 1: No, no, because if it was just effort.

783
00:50:31,546 --> 00:50:35,660
Speaker 1: if you put more effort in per unit time you would get more reward.

784
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:42,780
Speaker 1: But the cap on the amount of effort you can put into any MMO versus the relevant reward the cap is real low.

785
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,486
Speaker 1: It's like super compressed audio.

786
00:50:44,687 --> 00:50:45,771
Speaker 0: Well, there was that guy.

787
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:46,172
Speaker 0: he was.

788
00:50:46,373 --> 00:50:48,200
Speaker 0: he did it more quickly than anyone else.

789
00:50:48,420 --> 00:51:00,120
Speaker 0: So I imagine you know with some arbitrary knowledge that you could learn from the internet and with some effort and Concentration you could do it faster, but you you can do it just by spending time.

790
00:51:01,062 --> 00:51:02,429
Speaker 0: It's not a matter of skill.

791
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:04,620
Speaker 1: I don't know if we ever really point here.

792
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:10,860
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah new games are in a lot of ways better than old games and in some ways they lack things old games had.

793
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:12,836
Speaker 1: I don't know what direction gaming should go.

794
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:22,436
Speaker 1: in One hand I'm disappointed at how easy a lot of games are these days and how I just don't feel like I can fail and Like no matter how badly I do.

795
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:26,049
Speaker 1: eventually I'll always just plug ahead and win and people always know.

796
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,977
Speaker 1: Oh, well the game is 60 hours and at the same time.

797
00:51:28,997 --> 00:51:39,020
Speaker 1: I really don't miss the days of Dying in the second level of Contra like nine times in a row and then finally getting to the third stage.

798
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:46,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, without the I'm not sure where I stand, you know, it's like I'd like a game to not be stupidly easy.

799
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:51,919
Speaker 0: I like a game to test certain skills and I don't like games that test other certain skills.

800
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,115
Speaker 0: Arbitrariness really pisses me off if a game is unreasonably difficult.

801
00:51:57,216 --> 00:51:58,460
Speaker 0: It's not worth my time to play.

802
00:52:00,362 --> 00:52:07,040
Speaker 0: And what rim just said, you know if a game is you know old games I kind of liked how they were hard and new games.

803
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,599
Speaker 0: Sometimes I'm kind of sad that I beat it and then it's over so soon.

804
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:17,500
Speaker 0: But if I play an old game these days, I just get really frustrated because it's just so intolerable.

805
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:18,987
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on the game.

806
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:22,020
Speaker 1: and here's a point that I just thought of and I realize is kind of relevant.

807
00:52:22,263 --> 00:52:25,160
Speaker 1: It's your main to the design commander Not just bionic commando.

808
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:35,649
Speaker 1: But I think back to all the games the old school games that I love the ones that I just love to death kaboom Yeah, all those games kaboom bionic commando Zelda - whatever.

809
00:52:36,231 --> 00:52:39,700
Speaker 1: and I remember as a kid all the wonder because I had infinite free time.

810
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:56,239
Speaker 1: I was a kid playing Zelda - you know spending the crazy amount of time and effort it took to get good enough to even think about trying to get that hammer and The amazing sense of accomplishment I felt when I got that hammer and when I play the game now today I still have that skill.

811
00:52:56,822 --> 00:53:10,040
Speaker 1: So when I play Zelda - it doesn't seem as hard as it originally was when I play bionic commando It doesn't seem like it's that bad Because I forget the fact that I spent probably two or three years of my life becoming the grand master of these games

812
00:53:10,661 --> 00:53:10,802
Speaker 0: Mmm,

813
00:53:11,143 --> 00:53:17,220
Speaker 1: so I get all the benefit of spending that time as a child and all the wonder comes back through nostalgia.

814
00:53:17,802 --> 00:53:22,160
Speaker 1: I also get to enjoy the game on a higher level because I'm good enough at it to enjoy it on that level.

815
00:53:22,961 --> 00:53:31,766
Speaker 1: but at the same time no one new to this game is going to be able to enjoy it in any of those capacities except the capacity of childish wonder and Little kids today.

816
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:33,780
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess a six-year-old today or an eight-year-old.

817
00:53:33,941 --> 00:53:38,220
Speaker 1: I love Zelda - if you gave him the time to play it, but any I guess you explained to him that it was good.

818
00:53:38,804 --> 00:53:47,705
Speaker 1: I don't know if he'd be distracted by fancy new games But I think we tend to have a glowing perspective on old games as good as they were just for the fact that We're good at them.

819
00:53:47,865 --> 00:53:49,733
Speaker 1: So it doesn't seem as hard as it really is.

820
00:53:50,255 --> 00:53:51,260
Speaker 0: Maybe that's part of it.

821
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:57,491
Speaker 1: I mean find anyone who's never played bionic commando before and Let him beat even one level within.

822
00:53:57,511 --> 00:53:58,356
Speaker 1: I don't know 45 minutes.

823
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:06,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely Have a feeling that the the sense of wonder has been lost over time.

824
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:08,866
Speaker 0: for me like I just I beat Twilight Princess.

825
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:14,513
Speaker 0: what a few weeks ago and That wonder really wasn't the same as the wonder I wrote like.

826
00:54:14,573 --> 00:54:19,599
Speaker 0: I can recall the wonder from Zelda 1 You know and I can recall the feeling but I can't get it.

827
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:24,400
Speaker 0: You know, it's the same feeling but it's not the same intensity that was when it was actually happening.

828
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:28,040
Speaker 1: Well part of it was there weren't distractions and you could play whenever you wanted.

829
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:35,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now you know Twilight Princess I beat it But at no time did I have the same feelings that I had when I played Zelda 1.

830
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:44,560
Speaker 1: See now the thing is I don't know cuz while I don't have the same feelings Maybe just cuz I'm not as jaded as you but playing Twilight Princess I get an equivalently powerful feeling of wonder.

831
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:52,216
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not the same feeling It's not that feeling of like almost frightened awe that I'd get in like.

832
00:54:52,236 --> 00:54:53,520
Speaker 0: that's what I'm talking about.

833
00:54:53,781 --> 00:54:54,264
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

834
00:54:54,284 --> 00:54:59,066
Speaker 1: that feeling I think came partly out of the fact that as a child I didn't really understand how video games worked.

835
00:54:59,467 --> 00:55:05,605
Speaker 1: maybe and I never thought like oh you dump the ROM and you can figure out What's behind that block.

836
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:14,220
Speaker 1: I'd come to a dead end and I'd wonder to myself seriously I wonder what's back there and I'd throw holy water at the wall hoping that maybe I can get back there.

837
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,143
Speaker 0: That is true.

838
00:55:15,163 --> 00:55:17,352
Speaker 0: that in Metro I'd bomb down.

839
00:55:17,372 --> 00:55:23,599
Speaker 1: remember that one spot in Metroid in the bubbly area We could bomb down for like like two screens at the bottom was just a dead end.

840
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:25,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just kind of like a glitchy area.

841
00:55:25,433 --> 00:55:26,240
Speaker 1: You just go down there.

842
00:55:26,822 --> 00:55:28,388
Speaker 1: I was obsessed with that area.

843
00:55:28,649 --> 00:55:33,190
Speaker 1: I was sure there was something down there and even when I didn't find anything I was just kind of.

844
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,940
Speaker 1: it was like exploring new territory.

845
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:41,740
Speaker 1: I was an explorer and now I can't get that sense of wonder because I know exactly how video games work on a low level.

846
00:55:41,981 --> 00:55:42,364
Speaker 0: There was.

847
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:47,829
Speaker 0: I'd read something really interesting a long time ago How about video games like demystified the television.

848
00:55:47,990 --> 00:56:00,760
Speaker 0: and it's all about once you know, what's really going on All the mystification of it is gone and you totally can't be wowed or you know Sort of deceived or tricked or amazed by it anymore.

849
00:56:01,001 --> 00:56:04,763
Speaker 0: I mean sort of like if someone shows you how the magic trick is done That.

850
00:56:04,963 --> 00:56:08,540
Speaker 0: or someone shows you how like a really cool set piece and a play works.

851
00:56:09,002 --> 00:56:17,275
Speaker 1: Now when you go see it, you just go instead of going whoa See now there's where video games can go because I think Penn and Teller have the right idea.

852
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:18,219
Speaker 1: you do magic trick, right?

853
00:56:18,982 --> 00:56:23,000
Speaker 1: Like if you show how David Copperfield does his trick it's not interesting anymore.

854
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:31,766
Speaker 1: But Penn and Teller sometimes they'll show you how they do the trick a bunch of times and then they'll do the trick and you'll still Be amazed because it's not.

855
00:56:32,368 --> 00:56:33,412
Speaker 1: Oh, I know how they did that.

856
00:56:33,472 --> 00:56:34,194
Speaker 1: It's wow.

857
00:56:34,234 --> 00:56:35,439
Speaker 1: They actually did that.

858
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:40,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there's a way because I think video games as a whole are better than they used to be a lot better.

859
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:48,149
Speaker 1: But they're better in different ways and I think the things that they've lost can be made up for with equivalently good But different things.

860
00:56:49,299 --> 00:57:05,384
Speaker 0: I Think the way to go is you know, there's a lot of different courses of game design that people are taking You know in different directions, and I think we just need I don't know I don't think we need something some completely new game design because every time someone tries to do that It's it's really hit or miss.

861
00:57:05,404 --> 00:57:08,733
Speaker 0: you either get like a one-hit wonder like a katamari.

862
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:11,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, or you get a crap nothing game.

863
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,159
Speaker 0: That's completely useless.

864
00:57:12,702 --> 00:57:31,892
Speaker 1: We just I want to know we should somehow figure out exactly what it was that caused that Frightened sense of wonder we would have as kids playing video games that I get Glimpses of every now and then in new games like even in Twilight Princess when I got when I turned into a wolf Spoilers and went to that other world for a second.

865
00:57:31,992 --> 00:57:35,466
Speaker 1: I felt this twinge of wow What's this?

866
00:57:36,071 --> 00:57:37,100
Speaker 1: and it went away like that?

867
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:48,834
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's just because I'm an adult or because I'm now immune to it or because I know That some guy sat there coding this game and someone did the art and then they compiled it and put it on a disc and Shipped it to me.

868
00:57:49,722 --> 00:58:01,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the only games that really kind of get me now or like the the half-life twos I think those are the most recent games to really kind of kind of grab me with the whole immersion thing where I'm like whoa.

869
00:58:02,301 --> 00:58:09,298
Speaker 1: Yeah, well Twilight Princess really is grabbing me and whenever I sit down to play it I really really really get immersed and I really really really really like it.

870
00:58:09,841 --> 00:58:12,613
Speaker 1: Of course that might be that I didn't play much of ocarina.

871
00:58:12,634 --> 00:58:14,040
Speaker 0: That's about that's what I was saying.

872
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:23,398
Speaker 1: But the thing is I try Korean of time actually did it a lot for me way back when Even every time I tried to play ocarina time, it just wasn't polished enough and I just didn't like it.

873
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:28,030
Speaker 0: Oh, you're screwed up because everyone will tell you ocarina of time is the greatest than it is.

874
00:58:28,661 --> 00:58:30,119
Speaker 0: I think it's better than Twilight Princess.

875
00:58:30,722 --> 00:58:40,305
Speaker 1: Actually, if you say everyone we just had this discussion two weeks ago and you people are crazy And I believe multiple of us other than just me Express the same opinion.

876
00:58:40,345 --> 00:58:43,536
Speaker 1: The Twilight Princess is generally a more polished game.

877
00:58:43,676 --> 00:58:44,559
Speaker 0: Yeah polished.

878
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:44,820
Speaker 0: Yes.

879
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,960
Speaker 0: So if you take it doesn't make a difference, it's still not as good as ocarina of time.

880
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:50,368
Speaker 1: I think it's better so far.

881
00:58:50,388 --> 00:58:51,313
Speaker 0: Oh, what do you know?

882
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:52,500
Speaker 0: You didn't play ocarina of time.

883
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,214
Speaker 1: I've still played more ocarina of time than I have played of Twilight Princess.

884
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:57,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you know?

885
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:58,863
Speaker 1: I know what I played.

886
00:58:58,963 --> 00:59:00,389
Speaker 0: That's the best the forum.

887
00:59:00,429 --> 00:59:02,458
Speaker 0: What's the ocarina of time or Twilight Princess?

888
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:02,960
Speaker 0: What's better?

889
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:10,260
Speaker 1: All right Because so far everyone we've talked to has agreed with me not say all you people who haven't played ocarina of time.

890
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:11,693
Speaker 1: No out of us have played.

891
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:12,460
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a good game.

892
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,537
Speaker 1: It's just Twilight Princess feels more solid to me and I get more of a sense of wonder from it.

893
00:59:17,898 --> 00:59:20,327
Speaker 0: Yeah The exact opposite.

894
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:23,672
Speaker 1: Well, you're just generally a jaded prick.

895
00:59:23,774 --> 00:59:27,405
Speaker 1: anyway You're jaded about every video game.

896
00:59:27,887 --> 00:59:30,294
Speaker 0: Anyway, I mean, what do you think else to say?

897
00:59:30,856 --> 00:59:33,967
Speaker 1: No, not really except that Bitch a lot about video games.

898
00:59:34,368 --> 00:59:37,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, we like to bitch a lot about video games particularly you.

899
00:59:37,681 --> 00:59:43,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the thing I bitch about most in video game everything any game you're playing you sit there like this game sucks.

900
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:44,483
Speaker 1: What the fuck.

901
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,266
Speaker 0: this is all that.

902
00:59:45,327 --> 00:59:48,520
Speaker 0: because the problem is if a game sucks completely, right?

903
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:49,185
Speaker 0: I just go.

904
00:59:49,245 --> 00:59:51,079
Speaker 0: I don't even bother playing it because it's so bad.

905
00:59:51,541 --> 01:00:01,679
Speaker 0: My problem is that I'll play a game that is so much promise and has so many elements of fun and gets just a few Things wrong that are constantly irking me.

906
01:00:02,384 --> 01:00:14,400
Speaker 0: It's like imagine if you're eating this great apple pie right and then someone came and shook like some nasty spice on it or something and it's like Oh, this is such a great pie and you put this thing

907
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:14,902
Speaker 1: Ah,

908
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:20,623
Speaker 0: it that it irritates me even more than just a bad game because if a game is completely bad Don't need to play.

909
01:00:21,024 --> 01:00:23,311
Speaker 0: if a game is so close to perfect yet.

910
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:25,316
Speaker 0: There's something constantly annoying you.

911
01:00:25,617 --> 01:00:29,617
Speaker 0: it's like oh my god I really want this part, but I can't get rid of that part.

912
01:00:29,697 --> 01:00:36,200
Speaker 1: and see now Here's the problem because I can't name a game in the last like four years other than Phoenix, right?

913
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,910
Speaker 1: You didn't constantly bitch about it while you played it.

914
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:41,260
Speaker 0: whether it is so many games are far from perfect.

915
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:45,756
Speaker 1: Name a game then that's I mean, it seems like you can't even enjoy games anymore.

916
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:46,679
Speaker 1: I can.

917
01:00:48,162 --> 01:00:49,910
Speaker 1: Are you actually enjoying portrait of ruin?

918
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:51,879
Speaker 1: or you're just beating it so that you can be done with it?

919
01:00:52,441 --> 01:01:00,087
Speaker 0: See I really like walking around and hitting guys and exploring areas and fighting bosses and you know All that sort of stuff.

920
01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:02,039
Speaker 1: Are you enjoying the game as a whole?

921
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,003
Speaker 0: I'm enjoying it more than some other games like what like Let's see.

922
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,549
Speaker 0: What's worse more than Princess Peach.

923
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:12,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, Princess Peach was okay until I got to the end.

924
01:01:12,563 --> 01:01:14,339
Speaker 0: I just stopped playing Princess Peach in the middle.

925
01:01:14,641 --> 01:01:18,860
Speaker 1: No, the kiss actually later levels are really good not hard like hard hard.

926
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:23,760
Speaker 1: The problem was the game made me go back and do some bullshit and I just gave up at that point.

927
01:01:24,082 --> 01:01:26,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's it's it's good.

928
01:01:26,661 --> 01:01:34,920
Speaker 0: It just has some things that constantly annoy me and if they only change them the game could be awesome Which is why I appear more pissed off.

929
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,880
Speaker 0: It's like my level of pissed off in this is not directly related to the goodness of the game.

930
01:01:40,121 --> 01:01:43,252
Speaker 0: I'll be more pissed off at games that are 99% good than a games that are 50% good.

931
01:01:46,022 --> 01:01:47,727
Speaker 1: I can agree with that at least on WarioWare.

932
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:49,272
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's so close.

933
01:01:49,492 --> 01:01:56,500
Speaker 0: a game will be 99% good and 1% bad And I will bitch forever about that 1% bad because it could have been a hundred percent good.

934
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,773
Speaker 0: It would have been the best game ever and that lack of potential pisses me off.

935
01:02:00,195 --> 01:02:02,570
Speaker 0: Whereas a 50% good game I don't even play it.

936
01:02:02,691 --> 01:02:06,654
Speaker 1: So it doesn't bother me Anyway, since we as always have gone a little bit long.

937
01:02:06,754 --> 01:02:10,562
Speaker 1: Whoo in conclusion Twilight Princess is better than Ocarina of Time.
