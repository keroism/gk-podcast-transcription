1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,492
Speaker 0: It's Monday August 10th 2015.

2
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:15,621
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:19,170
Speaker 0: HTTP proxies and how they're often messing up your jam.

4
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:22,428
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:31,227
Speaker 0: So I've upgraded every computer I have except my old laptop to Windows 10.

6
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,910
Speaker 1: I have upgraded my laptop.

7
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:36,057
Speaker 1: I did that the Unlegit way because it never got a notification.

8
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:38,145
Speaker 1: it would have been that first because just waited.

9
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,434
Speaker 1: I did that first because there was nothing On that computer.

10
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:42,930
Speaker 1: I cared about it all so I could just erase it without worry.

11
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:48,233
Speaker 1: Then once the desktop got the notification and I learned all the deal that was going on I did that one.

12
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:49,939
Speaker 0: So you have what an x220 right?

13
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:51,605
Speaker 0: What's your laptop?

14
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:53,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think my laptop's next to 20.

15
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,281
Speaker 0: Okay, so I have an x230 and a guy at work has an x240.

16
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:58,449
Speaker 1: Well, I don't even know they went that high.

17
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:04,690
Speaker 0: So the funny thing is the x240 is basically the same as my 230 just slightly shittier.

18
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:09,130
Speaker 1: So I mean I figure if once it goes above x220 just get shittier, right?

19
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:11,821
Speaker 0: Oh, the 230 is objectively superior to the 220.

20
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,950
Speaker 1: It has the shittier trackpad and keyboard.

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:22,405
Speaker 0: It's so much faster that the 220 is unusable - I can edit premiere video and like render it out in my laptop.

22
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:27,433
Speaker 1: I mean the one I have at work I think is the 230 and Keyboards are fine.

23
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:32,090
Speaker 1: I don't know why has the shitty trackpad not the shitty keyboard, but I don't use either one.

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,277
Speaker 0: So you're saying the trackpad is shitty and it is.

25
00:01:34,297 --> 00:01:40,885
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say it's not but it's not shittier enough than the shitty x220s to be work.

26
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:44,138
Speaker 0: I mean Has ever had a good trackpad?

27
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:44,580
Speaker 0: like don't?

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:44,861
Speaker 0: okay?

29
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:48,774
Speaker 1: the x220 trackpad is Barely usable.

30
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:52,490
Speaker 1: the x2 the newer shittier one is unusable.

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,924
Speaker 0: So I was able to get it from unusable to almost usable by changing.

32
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:59,810
Speaker 1: some said, you know a good way to make it Really awesome by a Fujitsu laptop.

33
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:03,220
Speaker 1: No Buy a Mac Pro which has the real trackpad on it.

34
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:07,316
Speaker 0: the Fujitsu is like to this day because I have an old life book My first laptop.

35
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:09,910
Speaker 0: I spent like three grand on that thing a long time.

36
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:13,404
Speaker 1: Oh, those are like extra small and the days when the word Ultrabook didn't exist.

37
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:14,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that laptop.

38
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,075
Speaker 1: Yeah, those trackpads were good.

39
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:16,959
Speaker 1: They were better than the x220.

40
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,731
Speaker 0: Yeah, that thing actually had an amazing and so that life Wasn't.

41
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:20,756
Speaker 1: it was not amazing.

42
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:21,962
Speaker 1: It is not nearly an.

43
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:30,250
Speaker 0: actually I used it again recently because Emily brings it with her to like Kinetic on just for like presentations and stuff because that laptops actually fine.

44
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:31,795
Speaker 0: This is the old core to do.

45
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:38,679
Speaker 0: Oh that trackpad if you average all trackpads in the world today is One of the best.

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,909
Speaker 0: I would call it amazing.

47
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:43,836
Speaker 1: Are you counting?

48
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:47,090
Speaker 1: like, you know, you're just counting each kind of trackpad once, right?

49
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,430
Speaker 1: You're not counting every single Mac trackpad and averaging them all together because they've made a lot of them.

50
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:56,839
Speaker 1: They have the oldest ones weren't great Ever since they made the one giant trackpad.

51
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:58,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much been incredible.

52
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,230
Speaker 1: I don't know how much you've used one.

53
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:03,350
Speaker 0: I've used them and that's why I said that is still.

54
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:12,854
Speaker 0: However, if you don't want to spend that much money on a laptop and you want something that's quite like as powerful for half the money Then the Fujitsu.

55
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:16,087
Speaker 1: I mean if your trackpad is your just your purchasing decision, right?

56
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:16,730
Speaker 1: That's kind of weird.

57
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,309
Speaker 0: Well at this point my purchasing decision is Computers aren't getting faster and my laptops fine, so I'm not gonna buy a laptop.

58
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,032
Speaker 1: That's what I'm doing.

59
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:24,116
Speaker 1: That's my also plan.

60
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:27,630
Speaker 0: Like I don't know what laptops will be like when I buy another laptop

61
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:37,289
Speaker 1: I just get an iPad and then you really won't use your laptop unless you really need a keyboard or to do a Presentation with something and even then you can get the VGA or HDMI output from an iPad.

62
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:41,083
Speaker 0: So yeah thing is what I use my laptop or the keyboard for the iPad.

63
00:03:41,123 --> 00:03:45,337
Speaker 0: what I use my laptop for the most is Which an iPad does not do.

64
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,150
Speaker 0: number one actually is typing a bunch of shit.

65
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:49,295
Speaker 1: All right, you can get a keyboard.

66
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:50,119
Speaker 1: I can.

67
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,630
Speaker 0: number two is to five but I've had doesn't do that.

68
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,509
Speaker 1: Well, there you get some garbage sieve game instead.

69
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:56,497
Speaker 0: I'm hoping that well, we'll see what happens.

70
00:03:56,537 --> 00:04:02,221
Speaker 0: the only game that you receive some Wesnoth and free sieve That'll be only real real game.

71
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:03,850
Speaker 1: that counts as a real game, right?

72
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:10,650
Speaker 1: And the no true Scotsman kind of way that you can get on iOS or iPad as hearthstone and that is a very random game.

73
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:11,835
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's not.

74
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,483
Speaker 0: that's not gonna scratch my I guess.

75
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:14,970
Speaker 1: now you can get a lot of board games.

76
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,516
Speaker 1: You can get TNE on there.

77
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:18,543
Speaker 0: None of those things are gonna scratch my sieve.

78
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:22,830
Speaker 1: five itch when I'm like business I mean, there's like some Master of Orion clones.

79
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,344
Speaker 1: But you know in terms of things you can actually get opponents for or whatever.

80
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:27,910
Speaker 1: There is no sieve five on iPad.

81
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:35,190
Speaker 0: yep, so but yeah, I've upgraded to Windows 10 everywhere and Everything has worked a hundred percent fine.

82
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:45,270
Speaker 0: But I noticed a lot of people we know have had a lot of problems with Windows 10 upgrades And the problems that reported to me are one VirtualBox the thing I talked about last week.

83
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:49,109
Speaker 0: Just use the latest unstable build and VirtualBox works fine.

84
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:56,690
Speaker 0: Adobe Creative Cloud won't work unless you have updated Creative Cloud sometime in the past like three or four months.

85
00:04:56,791 --> 00:05:01,963
Speaker 1: So if you're not like didn't update their Creative Cloud They just installed it and it keeps saying hey update me update me.

86
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:03,109
Speaker 1: They keep saying no, dude.

87
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:23,260
Speaker 0: so I was googling to make sure like Audition and like my firewire chipset and the Mackie and all that nonsense would work in Windows 10 because you know, there's even odds and that stuff not working that well, I was worried and One of the first things I found with this dude who is like I've got audition 3 Will that work in Windows 10?

88
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,112
Speaker 0: and someone else is like there was a 3.

89
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:27,056
Speaker 1: Is that pre Adobe?

90
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,030
Speaker 1: because most of the things that that is what that is right after?

91
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:36,092
Speaker 0: Adobe bought the company that made cool edit and Renamed cool edit Audition.

92
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:42,009
Speaker 1: No, okay, but like most of the things out there like products from these big companies Microsoft Adobe, etc.

93
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:45,782
Speaker 1: We're actually products by other companies beforehand, right?

94
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:47,106
Speaker 1: Everyone says Adobe flash now.

95
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,150
Speaker 1: No remembers macromedia.

96
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:51,550
Speaker 0: I had macromedia action 3.0.

97
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,149
Speaker 1: Adobe bought macromedia and turned all their products into Adobe products and people don't remember macromedia unless they're old.

98
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:00,516
Speaker 0: in fact I had a class at RIT Microsoft Visio.

99
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:02,905
Speaker 1: that wasn't made by Microsoft is made by some other company.

100
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,310
Speaker 1: they bought and then renamed it.

101
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:10,089
Speaker 0: I remember pirating copies of director 7 and flash to do projects at RIT, right?

102
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,390
Speaker 1: It's like all this stuff was made by someone else and then these companies bought it incorporated it redid the UI.

103
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:27,150
Speaker 1: That's why even today you can see the ancestry of a lot of these long existing things You know like Adobe the only thing Adobe made as far as I know is fucking Photoshop and acrobat.

104
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:29,484
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think they made any of the stuff at all.

105
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:30,330
Speaker 1: I think they bought all of it.

106
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,009
Speaker 0: I think they might have even bought Premiere But a lot of weird stuff might not work.

107
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:40,990
Speaker 0: But like I saw a bunch of people were like I can't get fraps to work and I was like hot Why are you using fraps in 2015?

108
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,470
Speaker 0: Well, the thing with fraps straight is OBS does exactly what fraps does way better with less impact.

109
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,245
Speaker 1: Well fraps has a bad UI and so does OBS.

110
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:51,310
Speaker 1: They're even on that count.

111
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:56,614
Speaker 1: Yeah, fraps like I paid like what ten bucks or whatever it was Back in the day.

112
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,402
Speaker 1: that license is a forever license.

113
00:06:58,643 --> 00:06:59,506
Speaker 1: I feel like you paid for it.

114
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:00,330
Speaker 1: I'll just keep using this.

115
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,193
Speaker 0: But what do you use it for?

116
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,357
Speaker 0: because OBS does the same thing.

117
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:04,906
Speaker 1: better, but OBS is also bad.

118
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, but better I just use neither one.

119
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,206
Speaker 1: That's my solution.

120
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:16,910
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, I use OBS for even when I'm at work and like I'm doing like I saw You know, I have a build of like our software or whatever and I click on it and notice something weird.

121
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:22,803
Speaker 0: I'll just video it and I'll just record the window and I'll just attach the ticket and be like, yeah That's a dumb interface.

122
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:23,168
Speaker 0: fix it.

123
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:27,179
Speaker 0: So, uh, oh so I haven't updated my laptop yet.

124
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,509
Speaker 1: It's the last one and I'm an updated my HTTP see it.

125
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:35,210
Speaker 0: So yeah, it cheap HTTP see actually is ready to update and I might do that tonight.

126
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,939
Speaker 0: I didn't get the notification on it yet But the laptop is Windows 7 is a loan over x230.

127
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,048
Speaker 0: my co-worker with the loan over x240 said he went to.

128
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:47,586
Speaker 0: he upgraded it And half the hardware drivers just didn't like install.

129
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:48,570
Speaker 0: and now his laptops.

130
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:50,287
Speaker 1: That's really interesting cuz I'm my x220.

131
00:07:51,011 --> 00:08:04,079
Speaker 1: I did the full reset and when it fully reset and came back on I noticed like there's a whole bunch of Lenovo stuff like In there like oh, there's the Lenovo touchpad driver like already set up with everything But I there's the special Intel graphics thing.

132
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:10,210
Speaker 0: I think he also forced the update early So I did that as well on the laptop.

133
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, so and you both had a little bit of weird problems that then eventually resolve themselves.

134
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,490
Speaker 1: The only weird problem I had is because I reset early, right?

135
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,684
Speaker 1: I think that the is the media creator tool which you used which you can use.

136
00:08:20,704 --> 00:08:21,567
Speaker 1: you don't really need to.

137
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,910
Speaker 1: I never haven't actually Needed it yet, but I just did it because it's nice to be safe.

138
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,773
Speaker 0: I'm going to use it.

139
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:30,236
Speaker 1: lets you make a USB stick to boot off of right which you don't really need but it's nice to have.

140
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:34,249
Speaker 0: I'm gonna use that to reinstall cuz I got right here a new SSD.

141
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:37,350
Speaker 1: Well, you don't actually see you can reinstall without the USB stick.

142
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,330
Speaker 1: What you can do is on the light.

143
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:43,313
Speaker 1: I didn't know you could do that on the login screen or on just regular here For example.

144
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,363
Speaker 1: do it right now click on your own.

145
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:45,049
Speaker 1: don't do it right now.

146
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:56,110
Speaker 1: to record this show click on it when you go to either click on start and then you know power or on the Login screen click on power and hold shift and click reset.

147
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,054
Speaker 1: Don't just click reset.

148
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:58,300
Speaker 1: hold the shift key and press.

149
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,430
Speaker 1: click on the reset button in the menu there.

150
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:14,790
Speaker 1: It'll bring you to this special menu where you can basically click a button and say reset my computer delete all programs or Delete all programs and documents and settings and it's like two choices and it'll just do a full reset of Windows.

151
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:16,195
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I want a full reset.

152
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:20,490
Speaker 0: I want to install completely new on a different physical drive that currently is not in the computer.

153
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:24,046
Speaker 1: Uh, I think you can do that if you interrupt the thing at the right time.

154
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:25,273
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see I haven't.

155
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:34,489
Speaker 0: I haven't done that but I have that on a USB 3 PCI Express card here and with those combined, I think my core i7 920 is gonna make it another gear or two.

156
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,904
Speaker 1: All right, maybe that sounds good.

157
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:44,697
Speaker 0: Yeah I saw there was a slashdot thread and there people were talking about upgraded Windows 10 and There was one heading in that thread.

158
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:48,933
Speaker 0: that was someone being like I have a core i7 920 which is the processor I have.

159
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:50,945
Speaker 0: should I buy a new processor?

160
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:51,730
Speaker 0: Like is it worth it?

161
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,290
Speaker 1: I have never in my entire life taken a CPU out of a motherboard and put a better one.

162
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,316
Speaker 0: Well, you can't?

163
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,550
Speaker 0: you basically have to buy a new mother buy a new computer.

164
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:05,930
Speaker 0: Why I mean, I'm sure what I bought the socket that a 920 goes into does not exist anymore.

165
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:08,806
Speaker 1: No, I'm sure right, but I'm saying for example my computer.

166
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:12,070
Speaker 1: when I bought it I got like an i7 three and a half gigahertz.

167
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:22,147
Speaker 1: I think I could have I think what there was available a more expensive i7 that was slightly Insignificantly faster for hundreds more dollars that I could have bought for that same socket.

168
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:27,650
Speaker 1: I'm sure Chips of that make exist in the world today and I could acquire one.

169
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:28,941
Speaker 0: well the problem is every.

170
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:34,243
Speaker 1: I could Take the CPU out of my socket and put in a slightly faster one made for the same side.

171
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:41,741
Speaker 0: the cycle of computer upgrading is Long enough that by the time you think I could use a faster processor You're gonna buy a new motherboard.

172
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:42,930
Speaker 1: Anyway, pretty much.

173
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:58,509
Speaker 0: But oh, so all the responses were all these people coming out of the woodwork with low slash who were all like yeah, the core i7 920 was like the best fucking processor ever and There's really no reason to upgrade unless you're pegging your CPU all the time.

174
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:01,481
Speaker 1: You know, I pegged my CPU and code in the video.

175
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:03,470
Speaker 1: Yep, and even even then the GPUs helping out.

176
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, the GPU cuz I'm in creative and this guy or the bottleneck.

177
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:11,635
Speaker 0: I got SSDs, so I'm good I do but I'm not all SSD.

178
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:20,004
Speaker 0: I had two SSD daddy - so the the utenna masters like the video for just like doing our show There that's like 80 gigabytes of shit.

179
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:20,648
Speaker 0: Just sitting there.

180
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,442
Speaker 0: Anyway whole bunch of tech news.

181
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:28,004
Speaker 0: I want to blow through real quick But I guess we could talk about Scott's tech news verse.

182
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:31,360
Speaker 1: It's sort of a big Mostly not tech news, but slightly tech.

183
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:33,510
Speaker 0: Oh just before the show you were like, it's tech news.

184
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,415
Speaker 0: You're trying to convince me.

185
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:35,339
Speaker 0: This is tech news.

186
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,229
Speaker 1: part of it is that's the part I want to mister.

187
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:39,155
Speaker 0: Business is not tech news.

188
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:45,190
Speaker 1: It's not so Google is like restructuring their business, which is business news in a big way, right?

189
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,990
Speaker 1: So they're basically changing instead of the company being Google.

190
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:57,749
Speaker 1: The company is now called alphabet and Google is one of the companies that is a subsidiary Along with others such as you know, Google, I guess what else do they make?

191
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,054
Speaker 0: Well, there's Google.

192
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:02,490
Speaker 0: Google fiber nest is definitely gonna be super nest, right?

193
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:07,750
Speaker 0: So basically, they're gonna have a holding company that owns a bunch of its semi-independent companies, right?

194
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:16,863
Speaker 1: So of course the Google part which is the search engine and the ads and stuff has got a new CEO because the former Google CEOs are now alphabet CEOs instead etc.

195
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,325
Speaker 1: So no one.

196
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:18,168
Speaker 1: that's all business news.

197
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:18,710
Speaker 1: No one cares.

198
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:25,677
Speaker 1: What's interesting is they chose the name alphabet, which is a really common fucking word and it fits their theme here.

199
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:32,318
Speaker 1: of you know, Google B and G and s B and N. but All the stuff that's named alphabet is already owned.

200
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:37,858
Speaker 1: all the accounts all the domains all the everything is already owned by someone Right, and it doesn't belong to Google.

201
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,433
Speaker 0: So the question will be one Alphabet as a company.

202
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:43,616
Speaker 0: What do they?

203
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:46,484
Speaker 0: what will they own the trademarks to specifically?

204
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:48,710
Speaker 0: and will they even have a website, right?

205
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,043
Speaker 1: But there's like are they gonna have to fight someone for the DNS on this?

206
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:52,364
Speaker 1: like it?

207
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:53,890
Speaker 0: but that's business news not tech news.

208
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:54,954
Speaker 1: No, it's not it's tech.

209
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:55,798
Speaker 0: How is that tech news?

210
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,044
Speaker 1: DNS is a technology.

211
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:58,410
Speaker 0: DNS is a technology.

212
00:12:58,531 --> 00:12:59,053
Speaker 0: That is true.

213
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,325
Speaker 1: by that logic DNS battles are tech news.

214
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:07,790
Speaker 1: by that logic I can make literally anything a tech news, but the rest of it is not tech news is business.

215
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,102
Speaker 0: I mean tool use is technology that humans have learned.

216
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:12,483
Speaker 0: 40.

217
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,288
Speaker 1: stop being a pedant.

218
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,997
Speaker 0: or What's that quote from Silicon Valley?

219
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:17,439
Speaker 0: Dude?

220
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,182
Speaker 0: You're being a tool.

221
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:20,350
Speaker 0: I need you to be an asshole not a tool.

222
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,450
Speaker 0: Anyway the so my because this is kind of like new news.

223
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:34,210
Speaker 0: The best guess I have as to why this is happening is a big fuck you to Europe.

224
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:35,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, fuck you Europe.

225
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:40,156
Speaker 0: and I found a pretty good article that I have Castles and take everything else and shove it.

226
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:42,163
Speaker 0: So I skimmed this article.

227
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:43,267
Speaker 1: trees better be in those castles.

228
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:44,230
Speaker 1: No taking them out beforehand.

229
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:51,190
Speaker 0: I skimmed this article from a few days ago and It's on Bloomberg Business and you shall probably read it, but I didn't read it fully.

230
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:57,217
Speaker 0: It's way long But basically longer the more true it.

231
00:13:57,377 --> 00:14:07,690
Speaker 0: Europe is at a hard-on for going after to destroy any American tech company that Basically competes with their completely non-existent local tech industry, especially the Google, right?

232
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:25,584
Speaker 1: So they're basically generally upset that like this company that sort of is super important everywhere in the world and really really affects Especially not only, you know their whole universe but specifically the European economy is an American company and they have almost no control over it and all their Extra super European regulations don't apply to like

233
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:34,570
Speaker 0: their bullshit right to be forgotten weird all these weird like Advertising things and the fact that they don't have freedom of speech and all this nonsense.

234
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:41,310
Speaker 0: So Google has been mostly giving them the finger and from what I gather Google gave China the superfinger way back.

235
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:57,547
Speaker 0: Google seemed to have had like come to some sort of a chord with them But apparently that deal broke down and that might be why this might have been their contingency plan Because this structure might make it a lot easier for Google to tell Europe to rightly go fuck itself.

236
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:06,463
Speaker 0: I Really do not want Europe to break Google up Nor do I want Europe to have really any control over the internet.

237
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:08,694
Speaker 1: Google should just say fuck you Europe You know what.

238
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:11,129
Speaker 1: if you don't like us fine, no Google for you.

239
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:14,763
Speaker 1: and then Europe will have to do whatever Google says and everything will be set right.

240
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:15,686
Speaker 1: and Google shouldn't have to.

241
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:20,030
Speaker 1: why even bother trying To like work through legal loopholes or other nonsense, right?

242
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,349
Speaker 1: It just make Europe change their law to be what you want it to be.

243
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,913
Speaker 1: So what do you do?

244
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:26,470
Speaker 0: Why are all the people you like have working for you?

245
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,070
Speaker 1: You know, you just give them a whisper whisper whisper, right?

246
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,953
Speaker 1: And you just stop you to.

247
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:31,559
Speaker 1: basically you keep paying those people.

248
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,483
Speaker 1: even right who cares?

249
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,250
Speaker 1: just cut off all Europe.

250
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:38,026
Speaker 1: No one can search and be like make the law exactly what we want or else.

251
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:42,890
Speaker 0: We're not turning search back Scott as much as I think that would be kind of funny, you know and awesome.

252
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,900
Speaker 0: You might be guilty of basically racketeering.

253
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:48,405
Speaker 1: So deal with it.

254
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:49,429
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do about it?

255
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,093
Speaker 0: Arrest your employees.

256
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:53,462
Speaker 1: Just you're gonna start arresting Google employees.

257
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:54,145
Speaker 1: They're good.

258
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:55,249
Speaker 1: They had nothing to do with it.

259
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:56,998
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, but they can't get you.

260
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:58,346
Speaker 0: they'll Al Capone you you can't no one.

261
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:01,156
Speaker 1: Larry Page, what are you gonna do?

262
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:02,201
Speaker 0: You can never visit Europe.

263
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:02,924
Speaker 0: They'll arrest you.

264
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:04,089
Speaker 0: You'll never be able to see castles.

265
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:06,745
Speaker 1: They don't have any Google.

266
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:12,550
Speaker 1: fine Who's got the worst end of this stick, but they won't know how to find the castle without Google math.

267
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,614
Speaker 0: This is news.

268
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:15,643
Speaker 1: They want to find me without Google maps.

269
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:17,370
Speaker 0: That is still very emergent.

270
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:19,860
Speaker 0: So we will talk about this at length later.

271
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,250
Speaker 0: And normally we would just not talk about it.

272
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,930
Speaker 1: I'll go to Europe and they'll be like, they'll say cops go to the airport and arrest Larry Page.

273
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:27,297
Speaker 1: I can't get to the airport.

274
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,061
Speaker 1: I'm Google Maps.

275
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:32,663
Speaker 0: Yeah They're like wait, so where does Larry Page even live?

276
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:33,327
Speaker 0: they go to Google.

277
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:36,640
Speaker 1: ah Pages European castle address fuck.

278
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:39,250
Speaker 0: I imagine get Larry pages tweets.

279
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,203
Speaker 0: He's like, hey, I'm in and he named some city in like France.

280
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:46,750
Speaker 0: He's like, can you even find that city on Bing?

281
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:54,717
Speaker 1: The one cop who lives in the city comes knocking on the door and Larry's like wait don't arrest me I'll let you do two searches.

282
00:16:54,737 --> 00:16:55,199
Speaker 1: Yeah.

283
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:56,364
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

284
00:16:56,424 --> 00:16:57,609
Speaker 1: I need to search for something so good.

285
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:06,930
Speaker 0: but normally we don't talk about like brand like news that breaks like Pretty close to our dateline on geek nights, but this is actually pretty big.

286
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:11,950
Speaker 0: So we'll talk about it at length once the dust settles a little bit, but my money is on.

287
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,117
Speaker 0: This is a big fuck you to you.

288
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:14,263
Speaker 1: I don't think Google can win.

289
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,169
Speaker 1: anything can lose.

290
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,616
Speaker 1: Yeah in any fight with anybody.

291
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,342
Speaker 0: Well, they'll have the robots and the self-driving car.

292
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:24,373
Speaker 0: self-driving cars should start delivering poop Drones Dropping poop.

293
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:25,740
Speaker 0: So a bunch of little news is.

294
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,730
Speaker 0: there's two news is that I noticed that we're cut.

295
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:40,570
Speaker 0: They weren't related to each other But I think they're actually very closely related because I noticed in like stock stuff and just work that Pretty much all like Disney had a big drop and a lot of companies that I would generally like Disney have a big drop.

296
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,149
Speaker 1: They're basically owning pop culture.

297
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:57,640
Speaker 0: What I gathered is that the market going down the market the sector that got hit was anything that has a big interest in cable networks Television networks, of course, people are cutting the cord like crazy.

298
00:17:57,741 --> 00:17:59,646
Speaker 0: So there are two newses.

299
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:01,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, Disney's got a lot of TV action.

300
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:09,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll extricate themselves Because Disney will move to the internet Hasbro's moving to the.

301
00:18:09,998 --> 00:18:13,328
Speaker 1: this is only good news because the faster this happens the faster they'll stream.

302
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,934
Speaker 0: so Basically us.

303
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:20,210
Speaker 0: there's an article here talking about how the cord cutting like we all knew was gonna happen.

304
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,234
Speaker 0: It was was happening.

305
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:21,958
Speaker 0: It was moving fast.

306
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:24,550
Speaker 1: A lot of people pay for cable cut the cord a long-ass time.

307
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:25,574
Speaker 0: Yeah, a friend of ours.

308
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:27,381
Speaker 0: It was like a go message me.

309
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:29,810
Speaker 0: He's like, I thought you had cable and I was like, what the fuck?

310
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,279
Speaker 0: I haven't had cable in like two decades.

311
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,739
Speaker 1: I haven't had cable since 2000s been 15 years and I didn't watch cables.

312
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:54,582
Speaker 1: only my roommate my roommate watched soccer Cable and ball and I watched I think like maybe one show once I think I watched The Simpsons once so cord cutting accelerated relatively recently Faster than even people like us expected.

313
00:18:54,622 --> 00:18:56,309
Speaker 0: there was like a huge jump.

314
00:18:58,153 --> 00:19:06,846
Speaker 0: Well, what I think what it might be is that another wave of people Graduating and moving into college like remember we got the same number every year.

315
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:08,708
Speaker 1: It's a What do you mean wave?

316
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:15,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah, but so that the wave that just came in because remember we went to RIT like the cable come.

317
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:23,730
Speaker 1: So compared to last year, yeah those college graduates the ones this year a smaller percentage of them need television.

318
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:27,370
Speaker 0: Yep, and I think a smaller like the people coming into college are even like cable.

319
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:29,278
Speaker 0: Why would I even want Kate like?

320
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:30,925
Speaker 0: I think it's suddenly hit real hard.

321
00:19:31,408 --> 00:19:38,288
Speaker 0: and the second Worst which I didn't even think about because it's just so sad pay-per-view still exists.

322
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:41,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Basically it dropped down to negligible numbers.

323
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,230
Speaker 1: Well, because if there is a pay-per-view right it cost so much money.

324
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:47,590
Speaker 1: There's such a high incentive to just pirate that shit.

325
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,015
Speaker 1: So hardly anyone pay.

326
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:52,670
Speaker 1: even people who have cable are going on the internet to try to watch that shit.

327
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,861
Speaker 1: They don't want to pay 150 bucks to see some garbage boxing man.

328
00:19:55,921 --> 00:20:05,270
Speaker 0: In fact, I think that box and it specifically Caused a lot of older people who never thought about piracy to ask the grandkids how to get to that pirate bay.

329
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:11,624
Speaker 1: And also, you know, even when there is something worth seeing like say a Ronda Rousey fight You can just see it the next day on YouTube.

330
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:12,349
Speaker 1: It's like a minute long.

331
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:14,438
Speaker 0: So at the same time there's another article.

332
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:21,119
Speaker 0: adblock usage just recently Skyrocketed lazy over the past 12 months.

333
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,367
Speaker 0: It went up 41 percent globally.

334
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:24,150
Speaker 1: pretty good.

335
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,725
Speaker 0: So like people are starting to use adblock rapidly.

336
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:37,109
Speaker 0: I think Advertising as a revenue stream between TV internet is gonna just like fucking good explode any day.

337
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,316
Speaker 0: good Alright bunch of other stuff.

338
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:39,698
Speaker 0: real quick.

339
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,190
Speaker 0: Scotland just banned genetically modified crops.

340
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,012
Speaker 1: Fuck you Scott.

341
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:44,858
Speaker 0: or literally no reason.

342
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:48,790
Speaker 0: and even the farmers are like, uh, you literally just destroyed our entire market.

343
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:50,140
Speaker 1: No, but no fancy.

344
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,855
Speaker 1: No, we had to get natural Disgusting potatoes that die immediately.

345
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:56,181
Speaker 1: We're not like what counts so counts.

346
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:57,344
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's even funnier.

347
00:20:57,765 --> 00:20:59,830
Speaker 0: only Scotland did it not England.

348
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,948
Speaker 1: So basically all this Scottish money is gonna be going into England.

349
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:06,630
Speaker 1: People in Scotland eating disgusting vegetables.

350
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,922
Speaker 0: Genetically modified crops are because what did they?

351
00:21:11,023 --> 00:21:12,390
Speaker 1: well, what did they write in their law?

352
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,079
Speaker 0: I didn't read the law because it's some horribly European law.

353
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,570
Speaker 1: It's probably just says like oh don't eat the current.

354
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:24,160
Speaker 0: I'm not even going to dignify that Scottish accent with a response.

355
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:27,530
Speaker 1: Hey lady play the bagpipes next to the corn as well this time.

356
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:33,330
Speaker 0: The reason so I'm gonna skip all these other tiny news is because we already got on for a while.

357
00:21:34,616 --> 00:21:37,750
Speaker 0: The last one I want to talk about is this is super tech news.

358
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:39,335
Speaker 0: So, okay.

359
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:42,185
Speaker 0: I got to two actual tech news not business news.

360
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,409
Speaker 0: Like what Scott wants to talk about?

361
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,299
Speaker 0: There is a problem with Linux servers that is getting worse.

362
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,499
Speaker 0: We need for modern security and cryptography a lot of entropy like randomness.

363
00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:00,029
Speaker 0: like if you know the difference between Dev random and dev you random you should.

364
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:03,380
Speaker 0: Dev random will block if it runs out of entropy.

365
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,606
Speaker 0: dev you random will give you some bullshit seated.

366
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:13,087
Speaker 0: Yep, so You refill dev random by basically reading entropy and there's a lot that we're not.

367
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:15,727
Speaker 0: that's a big topic We can't really talk about now.

368
00:22:16,473 --> 00:22:17,619
Speaker 1: Talk to someone who knows about math.

369
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:25,530
Speaker 0: servers generate entropy But modern Linux servers for a variety of reasons don't generate enough entropy.

370
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:36,369
Speaker 1: So if you ask for too many random numbers too fast eventually the numbers you get either you won't get any more numbers or you won't get the numbers that are actually random enough anymore.

371
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:43,588
Speaker 1: and Then you'll be in big trouble security wise because like you start generating predictable keys or predictable encryption or who knows what.

372
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:44,150
Speaker 0: so we're not.

373
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:48,410
Speaker 1: We're generating less entropy and simultaneous or you just won't be able to send any more data.

374
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:53,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need the entropy way more for modern computing and security.

375
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:56,263
Speaker 1: So like a faster CPU helps but doesn't help enough.

376
00:22:56,304 --> 00:23:00,260
Speaker 1: you really need like an Entropy source like a block of cesium or who knows why.

377
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:02,570
Speaker 0: well, you can buy cards that are entropy generator, right?

378
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,428
Speaker 1: You know what's in there fucking some radioactive thing this.

379
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:07,137
Speaker 0: well No, actually there's a lot.

380
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:09,670
Speaker 0: a lot of me use temperature dips like temperature deltas and stuff.

381
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:13,946
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean random that org uses like like atmospheric pressure.

382
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:15,070
Speaker 1: They have like a thing on their roof.

383
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,418
Speaker 1: That's like, you know, like barometers or something.

384
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,966
Speaker 1: It's pretty interesting quantus TRNG.

385
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:21,130
Speaker 0: I just googled the first one.

386
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,958
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah here that Europe I googled it.

387
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:24,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's see.

388
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:25,970
Speaker 0: So I found a company check this out.

389
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,094
Speaker 0: It's a PCI Express card.

390
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:29,160
Speaker 0: what's on this random number generator?

391
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:31,970
Speaker 0: by exploiting a quantum optics process?

392
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:37,610
Speaker 1: There are many interesting sources of entropy in the universe, you know.

393
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:43,368
Speaker 1: Which is really kind of easy to find sources of entropy considering, you know, things are becoming more entropic all the time.

394
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:47,825
Speaker 1: Yeah But you know the cooler your source of entropy is the more your sales will be.

395
00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:48,670
Speaker 0: that that's true.

396
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:55,350
Speaker 1: I mean, would you rather buy the quantum optics random number generator or the atmospheric pressure random number generator?

397
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:56,555
Speaker 1: So I was cooler.

398
00:23:56,797 --> 00:23:58,990
Speaker 0: if you're like a system administrator in a place that matters.

399
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:10,930
Speaker 0: It's worth it to you to make sure you know if like your company writes software that runs on those servers if They're abusing random when they could get away with you random because you don't want to you don't want to run you want to pump.

400
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:13,830
Speaker 1: I pretty much always use you random unless there's a problem.

401
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:16,802
Speaker 0: Yeah So I noticed one of my software things that uses random like.

402
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:23,299
Speaker 0: I noticed a thing that opened it and was drawing from it and I went to the developer and was like Why are we using that instead of you random?

403
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:23,983
Speaker 0: and he was like, huh?

404
00:24:24,124 --> 00:24:25,230
Speaker 0: So I said change it to you random.

405
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:30,470
Speaker 0: And last but not least North Korea.

406
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:32,450
Speaker 1: But there's no technology there.

407
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:38,949
Speaker 1: They have a really bad internet and missiles that kind of suck and is switching to a new time zone that they just made up.

408
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,474
Speaker 1: Why do we even what?

409
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:41,218
Speaker 1: does it matter?

410
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:42,524
Speaker 1: Why does it even matter to us?

411
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:43,870
Speaker 1: What time it is in North Korea?

412
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:49,450
Speaker 0: So now at all Java has to have an update because Java has embedded time zone information.

413
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:53,330
Speaker 1: No, you don't need to update that because no one in North Korea uses Java.

414
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:59,310
Speaker 1: But well, no one in any outside of North Korea has any program that cares what time it is in North Korea.

415
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,719
Speaker 0: You might what if you were doing some sort of spy bullshit?

416
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,409
Speaker 0: and your spy bullshit thing keeps track of times and GMT.

417
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:06,630
Speaker 0: like it.

418
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:08,699
Speaker 1: The NSA can write a patch for themselves.

419
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:10,667
Speaker 1: They don't need us to work on this garbage.

420
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:11,330
Speaker 0: You're gonna write a pic.

421
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Java period like Java has embedded zone stuff.

422
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:21,960
Speaker 1: So everyone with a bunch who's got to do like I've got update to get new user times Whatever which this is your share zone info.

423
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,409
Speaker 0: So this actually fucked me not that long ago.

424
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:27,599
Speaker 1: Well, you've got your your trading stocks in North Korea.

425
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:30,567
Speaker 0: another group of Venezuela a similarly non-connected play.

426
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:31,410
Speaker 1: change your time zone.

427
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:45,721
Speaker 0: they changed their time zone shit, so daylight saving time happened at a different time and Basically a lot of people didn't like get the like update 70 whatever of jar JRE 7 and a bunch of shit stopped working.

428
00:25:45,782 --> 00:25:47,768
Speaker 1: when they're just OS's time zone info.

429
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:50,186
Speaker 0: take care of that Except people never update that stuff.

430
00:25:51,513 --> 00:25:57,190
Speaker 0: No, almost no one who runs Linux servers ever actually does like yum update all or whatever equivalent.

431
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:59,430
Speaker 1: I make sure my time zone is important.

432
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:03,462
Speaker 0: North Korea announced that it's winding his clocks back by a half hour.

433
00:26:03,783 --> 00:26:04,626
Speaker 1: for what reason?

434
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:06,512
Speaker 1: they just want to be different and Be jerky.

435
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:09,862
Speaker 0: Yes, so they're now you GZ plus 830.

436
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:14,053
Speaker 0: Okay different from South Korea and Korea eight or nine.

437
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:15,518
Speaker 0: I don't know actually.

438
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:16,200
Speaker 0: Okay.

439
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz my servers take care of that.

440
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:25,773
Speaker 0: Okay, and They're doing it to mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean Peninsula's liberation from Japan's Colonial rule.

441
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:27,619
Speaker 1: that's the way to have a celebration.

442
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,198
Speaker 1: change a time zone because you can't afford any other kind of celebration with actual like Confetti or beasts or anything.

443
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:33,144
Speaker 0: So two things.

444
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,130
Speaker 0: one change.

445
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:40,067
Speaker 0: I suspect that the political maneuver is they're trying to bully South Korea into.

446
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:53,341
Speaker 0: moving to South Korea can be like yes, we are committed to unification But at the same time South Korea is technologically savvy and is not stupid enough to so Pointlessly disrupt the job of people like me.

447
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:55,889
Speaker 1: everyone sleep an extra half-hour for no reason, you know.

448
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:56,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's the thing.

449
00:26:57,336 --> 00:27:09,023
Speaker 0: if South Korea changed everyone in South Korea who's like me would be like and have to do some bullshit and no one else would care and - it doesn't affect anyone in North Korea.

450
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:18,158
Speaker 0: I don't think watches things of the day.

451
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:21,632
Speaker 0: So I did watch the last episode of The Daily Show.

452
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:23,820
Speaker 1: No, I'm sure I should watch that at some point.

453
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,585
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

454
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:26,579
Speaker 0: Do you know what the premise is of the last episode?

455
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,144
Speaker 1: He has a premise.

456
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:30,440
Speaker 1: I thought it was just any old episode with some special.

457
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:31,892
Speaker 0: It actually isn't pretty much.

458
00:27:31,972 --> 00:27:38,740
Speaker 0: they get every Everyone who's ever been a correspondent on the show even like Craig killed like everyone.

459
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:41,427
Speaker 0: Some of them just send a video.

460
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:46,420
Speaker 1: but like there's a montage of like does he still tell you what happened the news for that day?

461
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:56,560
Speaker 0: So the best part is there's a point where he starts crying and he cries so bad They cut the commercial and they cut it out.

462
00:27:57,403 --> 00:27:58,266
Speaker 0: So he like.

463
00:27:58,306 --> 00:28:00,294
Speaker 0: he lost it and had to like recollect himself.

464
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:03,737
Speaker 0: He's really and he got so choked up He actually couldn't say his final goodbye at the end.

465
00:28:03,777 --> 00:28:05,492
Speaker 0: He was like And he leaves.

466
00:28:06,094 --> 00:28:07,177
Speaker 1: he's a short little dream, man.

467
00:28:07,197 --> 00:28:07,498
Speaker 1: Yep.

468
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:08,480
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good.

469
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,406
Speaker 1: I didn't want to go.

470
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:11,319
Speaker 1: you didn't have to go you could just kept doing it.

471
00:28:12,142 --> 00:28:16,780
Speaker 0: I sadly think this might be effectively the end of The Daily Show is relevant independent of Trevor?

472
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:17,664
Speaker 0: No, it was a good job.

473
00:28:18,106 --> 00:28:21,040
Speaker 1: people said that when Craig Kilborn left the show.

474
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,156
Speaker 1: I know I am reluctant to say the same now, but here's the thing.

475
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:27,224
Speaker 0: I Think the only thing.

476
00:28:27,304 --> 00:28:31,880
Speaker 1: I am a person who learns from the past and also accuses people of not learning from the past.

477
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:34,689
Speaker 1: So I cannot refuse to learn from the past.

478
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:46,978
Speaker 0: I think the show's format is obsolete in the modern era and the slightly longer format of John Oliver's show is better for the purposes of this kind of thing.

479
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:51,700
Speaker 0: and I wonder if The Daily Show as a format will survive.

480
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:53,960
Speaker 0: I think either the format needs to change.

481
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,796
Speaker 1: Well what the format changed when it switched to Jon Stewart.

482
00:28:56,856 --> 00:28:57,500
Speaker 1: it can change again.

483
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,705
Speaker 0: It actually didn't that much.

484
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:02,000
Speaker 0: they got rid of five questions because Craig Kilborn I guess owned that or something.

485
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,345
Speaker 1: Well, it was stupid anyway.

486
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:05,012
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was always really stupid.

487
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:05,333
Speaker 0: Actually.

488
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:08,026
Speaker 1: That's to say it's like letterman You can have your top ten list.

489
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:08,689
Speaker 1: No one gives a shit.

490
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:09,292
Speaker 0: I'll do top 11.

491
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:14,398
Speaker 0: Yeah, but The other thing is Comedy Central not doing so.

492
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:30,279
Speaker 0: well Television yeah, I think the infrastructure of The Daily Show might not survive and a show like it Produced out like Penn Jillette style on someone's own is gonna replace it at some point or something.

493
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,299
Speaker 0: I just I don't think the show format as it stands is gonna survive no matter how good.

494
00:29:35,922 --> 00:29:38,372
Speaker 1: No, it's like a day or two after the last show.

495
00:29:38,452 --> 00:29:39,517
Speaker 1: I guess last Friday.

496
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:41,764
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Coincidentally, right?

497
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:44,220
Speaker 1: I got out of work at three, but netrunner doesn't start until six.

498
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,920
Speaker 1: So what I'm doing is just like walking over to the river and laying in the grass for three hours.

499
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,399
Speaker 0: It's a good thing to do and then going to eat dinner and that's a real good thing to do.

500
00:29:52,701 --> 00:30:00,908
Speaker 1: So but I happen to pass by Ye Daily Show studio Yeah, and there was some people with ladders like up in the awning And I was like, all right.

501
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,887
Speaker 0: I'm glad I saw The Daily Show a few times in person So I'm glad I got to do that.

502
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:05,371
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

503
00:30:05,894 --> 00:30:06,800
Speaker 1: I've seen enough Daily Show.

504
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:13,659
Speaker 0: It's really weird when you see it in person though Because the lighting is all like low and red and they do a weird process to make him look human.

505
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:29,858
Speaker 0: So, yeah My thing of the day is a time-lapse of the entire run of The Daily Show of Jon Stewart's face And it's actually pretty good.

506
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:35,095
Speaker 0: It's weird seeing how young he looked when he took over The Daily Show.

507
00:30:35,155 --> 00:30:36,200
Speaker 1: go watch Jon Stewart.

508
00:30:36,282 --> 00:30:36,960
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

509
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:37,254
Speaker 0: ah.

510
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:45,269
Speaker 0: so I just clicked on it like from the very beginning of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and One of the first things I saw was Darth Maul.

511
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,092
Speaker 1: Okay.

512
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:48,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's been a long time.

513
00:30:48,321 --> 00:30:49,264
Speaker 0: Yeah, those things happen.

514
00:30:49,304 --> 00:30:51,310
Speaker 1: I mean go look at Jon Stewart on MTV.

515
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like he was our generation's Johnny Carson.

516
00:30:55,281 --> 00:31:02,158
Speaker 1: Maybe name someone else Mmm, if anyone else America doesn't have people like that, but there are other countries that have people like that.

517
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:03,959
Speaker 0: Oh, well, we had Johnny Carson.

518
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in this generation, right?

519
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,300
Speaker 1: There are other countries who have people who are like for that country on the Johnny Carson level or like literally everyone.

520
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:26,153
Speaker 0: Well, I just noticed something so that to keep Jon Stewart's face in the same spot There's a long arrow where the folk like the black ball the letterboxing on the left and bottom is Slowly growing as you see them like slowly moving where they point the camera.

521
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:27,277
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

522
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:36,219
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I mean you can't play the camera the exact same spot every day Yeah, but there was a progression where it moved for a while and then starting about two-thirds of the way through it never moves again.

523
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:39,490
Speaker 1: Maybe they you know worked on their camera.

524
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:40,755
Speaker 0: Anyway, this is really cool to watch.

525
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,020
Speaker 1: Oh It's SD back then so we know the paintball in the airsoft.

526
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Speaker 1: Those are respectable awesome activities of awesomeness that we simply don't have time money space effort.

527
00:31:51,402 --> 00:32:00,127
Speaker 1: Airsoft is illegal in New York City City sure, but you know There's a lot of those awesome things in the nerd world that we would like to do and you simply as a nerd cannot do Everything right.

528
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:01,340
Speaker 1: you have to choose your battles, right?

529
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:16,092
Speaker 1: Yeah If you're gonna watch Evangelion for the third time and if you're gonna play some counter-strike and you're gonna record a podcast and you're gonna make a gun to You pretty much and gonna ride your bicycle around and you're gonna take photos of stuff You cannot also do airsoft and paintball.

530
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:17,720
Speaker 1: This is only so much in your life.

531
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,832
Speaker 1: So unless you're independently wealthy sure and you don't have to work.

532
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,960
Speaker 1: But anyway, even then you have to choose right?

533
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,916
Speaker 1: You just choose more things.

534
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:34,309
Speaker 1: There is a third thing besides paintball on airsoft that may be better than either of the other two and that thing is this I this YouTube video is pretty popular this week.

535
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,180
Speaker 1: It is basically airsoft slash paintball except archery.

536
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:38,867
Speaker 1: That's all you need to know.

537
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:41,745
Speaker 1: It also appears to have rules At least.

538
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:47,399
Speaker 1: I don't know what the actual rules are But watching the video you can make a really educated and intelligent guest unless you're a moron.

539
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:54,217
Speaker 1: It seems to be a lot more interesting and skill-based in addition to being archery instead of paint or airsoft.

540
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:57,783
Speaker 1: and the best part Is you don't have to like keep buying Ammo and shit.

541
00:32:57,803 --> 00:33:08,464
Speaker 1: you buy a bow and it seems I can just use a normal fucking bow like just a recurve bow and you get this, you know arrows that won't kill people because they're all doofy on the end and You're all set.

542
00:33:08,484 --> 00:33:11,459
Speaker 1: You don't need to like keep buying paintballs or pellets or whatever it is.

543
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:17,507
Speaker 1: So it's kind of if I was gonna do one of these if I became independently wealthy I would choose this one.

544
00:33:17,527 --> 00:33:17,868
Speaker 0: That's right.

545
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:20,260
Speaker 0: Have you ever have you done archery anytime in recent memory?

546
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,512
Speaker 1: I have done archery at every time I was ever at summer camp.

547
00:33:24,074 --> 00:33:25,480
Speaker 1: I did extensive archeries.

548
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,293
Speaker 1: So in the moment also at RIT, I did our trees as well.

549
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:31,318
Speaker 0: I got.

550
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:31,880
Speaker 0: I got a reset.

00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,948
Speaker 0: I was doing my micro machines thing.

552
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:38,317
Speaker 0: in the middle of the book of book is Fantasy book the novel the eye of the wildo.

553
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:43,100
Speaker 1: Yep I haven't found the eye yet or the world part, but I found all the other parts.

554
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still want the one kid to die cuz I'm just bored with him.

555
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:54,568
Speaker 0: He's annoying and the wolf kids pretty chill and I wish he'd just be like, okay I guess I'm a little person just live with it.

556
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,111
Speaker 1: Mmm.

557
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:55,633

Speaker 0: It'll get the good audience.

582
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,560
Speaker 0: It'll be like the people who watch f1 versus the people who watch NASCAR.

583
00:35:24,408 --> 00:35:26,603
Speaker 1: Anyway That was weird.

584
00:35:26,844 --> 00:35:27,125
Speaker 1: Okay.

585
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, what happened?

586
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:30,700
Speaker 1: I don't know my phone was having to be against this piece of metal.

587
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard that noise.

588
00:35:31,987 --> 00:35:34,280
Speaker 0: I was about to stop the show and be like what's going on back.

589
00:35:34,481 --> 00:35:38,017
Speaker 1: This is my phone, but it was just next to something that made worse noise than usual.

590
00:35:38,298 --> 00:35:39,955
Speaker 0: All right HTTP proxies.

591
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:41,523
Speaker 1: So I had.

592
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:52,822
Speaker 1: I was just thinking about technologies and this one has come up a lot lately because you know I was installing lots of softwares and configuring lots of softwares with Windows 10 and various things and I kept seeing in pretty much every Software.

593
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:58,860
Speaker 1: there's always this configuration panel to set up HTTP proxy and it's something I never ever ever ever ever do.

594
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:00,726
Speaker 1: But it came to mind.

595
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:04,919
Speaker 1: I was thinking about show ideas and a G. proxies were on the mind and I'm like, you know what?

596
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,422
Speaker 1: Those do.

597
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:08,290
Speaker 1: well, not only could talk about HTTP proxies.

598
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,077
Speaker 1: You know about proxies in general all socks.

599
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:10,860
Speaker 0: You know socks.

600
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:11,840
Speaker 0: I know a lot of socks.

601
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,719
Speaker 1: I don't talk about that.

602
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,625
Speaker 0: We just even listen to the Wikipedia quote.

603
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:19,640
Speaker 0: socks also forwards arbitrary data after connection phase and is similar to an HTTP connected.

604
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:24,634
Speaker 1: But there's so much things involved in this one technology.

605
00:36:24,654 --> 00:36:26,640
Speaker 1: I was like, hey, you know, we could do a whole show about this.

606
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,806
Speaker 1: So first of all, what is a proxy?

607
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,089
Speaker 1: So you have a server.

608
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,814
Speaker 1: the server is serving something.

609
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:35,927
Speaker 1: you then have a proxy server Just like you would have a proxy card.

610
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:42,291
Speaker 1: if you're playing Magic the Gathering where you just take a piece of cardboard and write down You know force of nature on it pretends to be the server in some sense.

611
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:45,220
Speaker 0: Yes, but sits in front of it exactly.

612
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:51,569
Speaker 1: So it's not totally replacing it, you know standing in It's sort of you want to talk to.

613
00:36:51,729 --> 00:37:03,740
Speaker 1: I want to talk to this server that rims got his counter-strike server He's I. instead of talking directly to his counter-strike server I talked to this other server and that server then talks to the counter-strike server and then it forwards the communications between us.

614
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,054
Speaker 1: It's basically an intentional man-in-the-middle attack.

615
00:37:06,095 --> 00:37:10,439
Speaker 1: when you think about it There is this other server between you and the server you actually want to talk to now.

616
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:17,217
Speaker 1: Obviously this can be used for a man-in-the-middle attack Which is really bad because then suddenly you type in google.com and you see porn.

617
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:22,286
Speaker 0: now It is often used as a man-in-the-middle attack in a. well Let's talk about HTTP proxies.

618
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:28,780
Speaker 1: right because that's an HTTP proxy specifically is a proxy Just like I talked about for the counter-strike server only for web servers.

619
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:36,306
Speaker 1: So you try to visit some website and instead of your get request going to the server that has that website It goes to some other server.

620
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:39,882
Speaker 1: that server may or may not get the website You know.

621
00:37:40,163 --> 00:37:44,920
Speaker 1: forward your request along to the original website and then it'll send you a response.

622
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:50,359
Speaker 1: Maybe it'll send you the response to that web server sent back or it'll send you whatever the fuck it wants.

623
00:37:51,441 --> 00:37:56,900
Speaker 1: So instead of browsing the actual web you're browsing the web as this proxy server wants you to see it.

624
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:01,440
Speaker 0: So for most of history when these existed they existed and they still exist.

625
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:08,360
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but like when they existed in that history, they existed in one place at your school work place of business.

626
00:38:09,006 --> 00:38:18,760
Speaker 0: It'd be sitting there Intercepting all your web traffic because they configured it in the browser And it would one be blocking porn sites and to logging everything you did.

627
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,996
Speaker 0: So you'd get in trouble later if you went to weird stuff.

628
00:38:21,237 --> 00:38:22,283
Speaker 1: exactly so you said it.

629
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:27,322
Speaker 1: you set up a LAN and you have all these employees or students or whatever and You block.

630
00:38:27,603 --> 00:38:29,187
Speaker 1: you set up the routers such.

631
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:33,480
Speaker 0: Oh, you're so yeah, most schools in the 90s didn't actually block.

632
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:36,260
Speaker 1: They just configured the bride when people weren't any good at this.

633
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,940
Speaker 1: But now if you're smart, you'll prevent people from directly accessing the internet from their computer.

634
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:47,254
Speaker 1: So any traffic that they want to send to the internet gets routed to this server.

635
00:38:47,294 --> 00:38:51,987
Speaker 1: that's in your building and that server Usually is you know behaving nicely.

636
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:58,433
Speaker 1: you configured it to be a nice HTTP proxy where what it does is You know filtering if a request comes to it and it's what.

637
00:38:58,474 --> 00:39:02,069
Speaker 1: for a domain that it doesn't like it Just won't honor your request and will send your response.

638
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:17,080
Speaker 1: It's like hey, no visiting that porn site But usually it'll send your request to Google get the response from Google send you the response sure, it'll log that you where you went and who went there and Such and such and also do some nice things like keeping a local cache.

639
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:21,660
Speaker 1: So the next person who makes the same request will get the same response without having to actually as Google again.

640
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:33,598
Speaker 0: Yep, so, you know in the old days like especially back when bandwidth was kind of limited If you had more than one nerd living in a house one of the nerd like especially at a university One nerd would be like hey guys I set up a squid proxy and everyone connect to it,

641
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:33,820
Speaker 1: right?

642
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,020
Speaker 1: And that it actually saved you a lot of bandwidth and such and you could set you up When we live in our house, right?

643
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,364
Speaker 0: I go to slash dot.

644
00:39:40,686 --> 00:39:43,860
Speaker 0: then you would hit five five on slash and it wasn't like websites are so dynamic.

645
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:48,159
Speaker 1: Then as they were now where every person's logged into Facebook and everyone's seeing something completely different.

646
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,640
Speaker 0: guys It was web 1.0 right web 2.0 didn't exist.

647
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,685
Speaker 1: So when I visited slash that when rim visited we saw pretty much the same thing and we just kept hitting f5 Like it wasn't.

648
00:39:56,705 --> 00:40:02,928
Speaker 1: so these HTTP proxies are because most of the things you do with your computer Http, right?

649
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:04,720
Speaker 1: You're visiting websites doing web stuff.

650
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:09,680
Speaker 1: So an HTTP proxy can be used for great great good or great great evil and everywhere in between.

651
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:11,539
Speaker 1: There's so many things you can do with them.

652
00:40:11,862 --> 00:40:18,740
Speaker 1: We probably won't even be able to touch on half of them in this show But caching for performance reasons is one of the good things that you can do with one of them.

653
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:24,226
Speaker 0: so one of the bad things they do is what companies can do is If you like HTTP.

654
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:34,143
Speaker 1: well thought SSL doesn't work through a web proxy natively Usually exactly because well, you could set one to just be like, okay someone's using SSL just let them go through.

655
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:35,065
Speaker 0: I could do that.

656
00:40:35,305 --> 00:40:39,739
Speaker 0: or what some people do is Core and I've seen companies do this.

657
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:44,040
Speaker 0: People do this as well because they control the computer you use at work.

658
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:55,577
Speaker 0: They install a fake certificate to every major website like Google or whatever like a root like bullshit certificate Yeah, and then they run that on the proxy server and they take all your travel.

659
00:40:55,617 --> 00:40:56,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm Google.

660
00:40:56,581 --> 00:41:00,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, your browser thinks that it's using SSL because you're communicating with the proxy server.

661
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:07,540
Speaker 1: With encrypted SSL the proxy server is decrypting everything because you're using its certificate not the real Google certificate.

662
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:10,970
Speaker 1: So your browsers has a green light Google a-plus.

663
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,532
Speaker 1: It doesn't know.

664
00:41:11,572 --> 00:41:13,397
Speaker 1: there's no way it can know that.

665
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,039
Speaker 1: that's not cool.

666
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:24,720
Speaker 1: and Now whoever's running the proxy server can see everything you're googling because they decrypted all your traffic and then they may or may not Pass that on to Google encrypted or unencrypted using the real certificate.

667
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,790
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter because they've man-in-the-middle do and they see everything.

668
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:30,620
Speaker 0: and they can do this because they have root on your PC.

669
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:31,885
Speaker 0: And you probably wouldn't even know.

670
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:37,713
Speaker 0: and you can't even tell unless you inspect this HTTP proxy know what to look for.

671
00:41:37,753 --> 00:41:46,587
Speaker 1: HTTP proxies these days Especially on the LAN are so fast that you if you put on appropriate hardware with appropriate network speeds You won't even know you're being proxy.

672
00:41:46,628 --> 00:41:50,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, like no one has to set this up in the browser anymore It's on the network level.

673
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:51,533
Speaker 0: You don't even know it's there.

674
00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:55,640
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly You can inspect the hashes of the certificates, I guess and figure it out.

675
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:03,120
Speaker 0: But most people so I think a lot of people are probably listening to this at work tomorrow and they're like, oh Maybe I shouldn't be on this website.

676
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:09,180
Speaker 1: If you're if you maybe shouldn't be on that website at work, you maybe should be fired and deserve it.

677
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,616
Speaker 0: So, you know, well, you might be working for a company.

678
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:15,409
Speaker 0: that is weird Like I should be working for a different company every Monday at work.

679
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,152
Speaker 0: I read ogloff.

680
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,780
Speaker 0: But one I don't read ogloff at work.

681
00:42:19,021 --> 00:42:19,447
Speaker 0: Why not?

682
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:21,004
Speaker 1: I Read.

683
00:42:21,024 --> 00:42:22,314
Speaker 1: I watch YouTube at work.

684
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:30,276
Speaker 0: I read read it work I don't need to watch is I wouldn't read ogloff at work Like if someone was standing behind me looking at my monitor unless I was showing it to them.

685
00:42:30,296 --> 00:42:31,359
Speaker 1: I don't read ogloff at work.

686
00:42:32,323 --> 00:42:32,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, I read.

687
00:42:32,866 --> 00:42:34,011
Speaker 1: I might read another webcomic.

688
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:35,356
Speaker 0: I'm rude on my own PC.

689
00:42:35,537 --> 00:42:36,160
Speaker 1: So yeah me too.

690
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,032
Speaker 1: But I'm you know, I still don't read ogloff at work.

691
00:42:38,093 --> 00:42:43,760
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway Yeah, other things that you can do an HTTP proxy you can get fun, right?

692
00:42:44,101 --> 00:42:47,180
Speaker 1: So there's lots of fun things that you can do which may or may not be evil.

693
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:52,679
Speaker 1: For example someone visited a website, you know, you pass along that request to the original website for a crew.

694
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:54,495
Speaker 1: calm You get a response of front row.

695
00:42:54,515 --> 00:42:55,000
Speaker 1: crew calm.

696
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,200
Speaker 1: Now the proxy has to send a response back to the original users so their browser can render the page.

697
00:42:59,401 --> 00:43:01,619
Speaker 0: Oh, look, let's flip all the images upside down because that's funny.

698
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:07,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can modify the data that is coming back from the real web server in any way you want.

699
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:08,679
Speaker 1: Let's replace every image with cats.

700
00:43:09,581 --> 00:43:13,932
Speaker 0: There is in fact a famous old story on slash top that I pretty sure was legit because people have done this.

701
00:43:13,972 --> 00:43:21,740
Speaker 0: like it's not If you see a neighbor stealing your bandwidth because they're using your open like they cracked your web or whatever.

702
00:43:21,921 --> 00:43:23,366
Speaker 0: Yeah old days make a proxy.

703
00:43:23,627 --> 00:43:26,999
Speaker 0: just make all their images be upside down and they will never be able to troubleshoot that.

704
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,413
Speaker 1: You know the thing you do is you can make like all domains get reversed.

705
00:43:30,634 --> 00:43:37,358
Speaker 1: So they'll have to type in like elgog.mock And you just you switch everything around all the time.

706
00:43:39,205 --> 00:43:40,159
Speaker 1: Good stuff like that too.

707
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,460
Speaker 0: You can do pretty much anything that you can imagine if you're a bunch of nerds here in a house.

708
00:43:44,762 --> 00:43:47,160
Speaker 0: Set up a proxy that blocks ads there.

709
00:43:47,714 --> 00:43:52,897
Speaker 1: Yeah It's actually a really great way to do adblock because now you save the horsepower on your computer from doing it.

710
00:43:53,298 --> 00:44:09,799
Speaker 1: You also block the ads not only in you know, cuz even if I use adblock for example on My computer then in that browser Chrome which has adblock installed I'm blocking the ads and my computer is doing the work of blocking those ads if I have an HD proxy set up.

711
00:44:10,422 --> 00:44:11,812
Speaker 1: It's not only blocked in that browser.

712
00:44:11,853 --> 00:44:12,800
Speaker 1: It's blocked in every browser.

713
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,304
Speaker 1: It's blocked in every can.

714
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:26,460
Speaker 1: every HTTP request on my entire network that goes to the internet has the ads removed from the response On your iPhone on your iPad on your Android device on devices that usually don't have adblock your Xbox, right?

715
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,980
Speaker 1: These are all making HTTP requests to get ads.

716
00:44:30,382 --> 00:44:40,160
Speaker 1: You can block all those on the proxy level and all these devices Which usually you have no control over and are serving up ads won't have ads at least if they're on your land behind that proxy.

717
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,583
Speaker 1: Yep, and that is a real good.

718
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:41,943
Speaker 1: That's right.

719
00:44:41,963 --> 00:44:44,087
Speaker 1: The best thing you can do with ads forget ads.

720
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:47,559
Speaker 0: you can block a malware Sure, why not?

721
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,582
Speaker 1: This is right.

722
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:54,180
Speaker 1: the malwares will often some of them use non HTTP, but most of them will be using HTTP requests.

723
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:59,216
Speaker 1: You know outgoing because they're trying to like tell some web server about your computer or who knows what.

724
00:44:59,557 --> 00:45:01,163
Speaker 1: you just block all that You know.

725
00:45:01,203 --> 00:45:05,100
Speaker 1: install some kind of filters or intelligent monitoring to see and be like, huh?

726
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,549
Speaker 1: Why are these HTTP requests being made?

727
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:09,679
Speaker 1: No, I'm not using any computer right now.

728
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:10,806
Speaker 1: What's going on?

729
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:12,880
Speaker 1: proxy do something about this done?

730
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,200
Speaker 0: so if you are malware.

731
00:45:15,762 --> 00:45:28,546
Speaker 0: One of the common ways for malware to work is basically to proxy all your traffic that it can Through some dodgy server somewhere and steal all your info or just install a low Hd-proxy on your local machine.

732
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:31,474
Speaker 1: have your local machine use a proxy installed on itself.

733
00:45:31,654 --> 00:45:33,299
Speaker 0: Yep, which is real easy to do.

734
00:45:34,924 --> 00:45:40,587
Speaker 1: I mean most of the traffic that people are interested in is HTTP and most of the things we will do are Hdbs of proxying.

735
00:45:40,627 --> 00:45:42,700
Speaker 1: that is the most useful and the most interesting.

736
00:45:43,082 --> 00:45:46,762
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's so many things go over HTTP that aren't just websites it's just.

737
00:45:46,962 --> 00:45:51,879
Speaker 0: you can get really crazy now if you're in like enterprise or server like software side.

738
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:57,940
Speaker 0: a Problem often with these proxies is that they detect like malware and whatever and they throttle bandwidth and everything.

739
00:45:58,442 --> 00:46:09,200
Speaker 0: so you might make an application or a web service or something that works great in your lab and Then you tell like the corporate sales or whatever people connect to it and stuff breaks in weird ways.

740
00:46:09,722 --> 00:46:11,469
Speaker 1: Or it's a proxy might be caching it.

741
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:13,900
Speaker 0: It's really slow for some reason.

742
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:26,920
Speaker 0: It's like like the application connects like you can ping just fine But then when they connect to the HTTP port Like the one widget just doesn't load because the proxy is blocking some but not all of the HTTP track, right?

743
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:31,020
Speaker 1: You you carefully crafted this fancy JavaScript application and all right.

744
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:38,500
Speaker 1: But then the proxy modifies the HD the HTML the CSS or the JS that the client is actually receiving and our application doesn't work.

745
00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:39,564
Speaker 0: It's not.

746
00:46:39,624 --> 00:46:52,088
Speaker 0: it's not cleanly delivering to them what you gave out and if you don't understand how proxies work and all that This will be an infuriating problem because usually network issues are I can get to the host or not I can connect to the port or not.

747
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:59,986
Speaker 0: here you're connecting to the port but inside of that connection Individual little bits are being fucked up Real hard to troubleshoot.

748
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:03,820
Speaker 0: so you pretty much have to have this heuristic in your head of wait a minute.

749
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:05,968
Speaker 0: Is there a proxy been between my thing and you?

750
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:13,675
Speaker 1: right and it's basically because the person you'll be talking to is gonna be you And the customer who has this application who's just an employee at the other office.

751
00:47:13,936 --> 00:47:19,438
Speaker 1: and meanwhile now the IT Department at the other office is now involved somehow even though they didn't need to be involved.

752
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:23,110
Speaker 1: now They are because their proxy server is interfering with this business.

753
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:23,752
Speaker 1: That's going on.

754
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:26,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like oh god damn it you guys Why you gotta do this.

755
00:47:27,385 --> 00:47:35,719
Speaker 0: one of the jobs I had at IBM a long time ago was setting up and maintaining Sox proxies through our OS to warp systems for like factory automation stuff.

756
00:47:38,598 --> 00:47:41,697
Speaker 0: I Never really want to interact with that world again.

757
00:47:42,602 --> 00:47:43,426
Speaker 0: Those are dark times.

758
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:46,360
Speaker 1: Well Sox is like a. isn't that a way to proxy like anything?

759
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,314
Speaker 0: Yes, it's a generic in the days before like modern ways of doing VPNs and things.

760
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:52,297
Speaker 0: that was like.

761
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:56,580
Speaker 0: you could just Proxy anything to anywhere with arbitrary rules.

762
00:47:57,182 --> 00:48:02,920
Speaker 0: But you have to like install a Sox proxy on the local PC and set it up and it was complicated.

763
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:10,000
Speaker 1: Mmm, there's also the reverse proxy, which is usually used when you're the one who has the web server.

764
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,152
Speaker 1: So I set up a website and I got a whole.

765
00:48:12,252 --> 00:48:13,700
Speaker 1: I want to make a whole bunch of web servers.

766
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,792
Speaker 1: All right, cuz I need.

767
00:48:14,812 --> 00:48:16,106
Speaker 1: I have a lot of traffic I need to handle.

768
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:20,940
Speaker 1: so I mean instead of making one big server I make a whole bunch of little ones and then I set up a reverse proxy.

769
00:48:21,342 --> 00:48:25,360
Speaker 1: So now when people make a request to my website, they don't go to any of these web servers.

770
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:35,669
Speaker 1: They go and connect to the reverse proxy Which is then we'll make the request to one of my hidden web servers that are hiding in my LAN and then it will cache Those responses going out.

771
00:48:36,172 --> 00:48:43,840
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like now I've got an HE proxy on the server end and not on the user end and it's helping me out in the reverse direction.

772
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:47,419
Speaker 1: So that's why it's called a river channel, but it really does mostly the same thing.

773
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,282
Speaker 0: But think about this.

774
00:48:48,342 --> 00:49:01,579
Speaker 1: then you can change your internal infrastructure completely arbitrarily and no one outside ever needs to know Yeah They're just making the same HTTP request to the same server load balancer whatever it is and everything that you do is behind it somewhere.

775
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,014
Speaker 1: and There you go.

776
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:09,780
Speaker 0: Now fancier people will use routers and network level devices to do that at the network level with extremely high performance and reliability.

777
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,030
Speaker 1: There's a lot of different things.

778
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,180
Speaker 1: you can do it depending, you know.

779
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,620
Speaker 1: But like for a lot of web like just just routing won't get you any caching, right?

780
00:49:15,803 --> 00:49:16,900
Speaker 1: So it depends on what you want.

781
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:19,000
Speaker 1: You can also route to a whole bunch of different caches.

782
00:49:19,362 --> 00:49:22,860
Speaker 1: You can set up all sorts of different architectures there with the reverse proxy.

783
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:26,451
Speaker 0: So yeah proxies, they're pretty interesting.

784
00:49:26,492 --> 00:49:28,279
Speaker 1: There's a lot you can do is like you can have fun with.

785
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:35,284
Speaker 1: I recommend at your house is the the best thing you can do if you want to learn about these is to set one up for fun.

786
00:49:35,365 --> 00:49:38,740
Speaker 1: and what you do is At your house, you got a wireless network.

787
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,512
Speaker 1: I bet you probably do set up a separate wireless network for your guests.

788
00:49:42,652 --> 00:49:45,521
Speaker 1: most home routers that aren't garbage can do this Right.

789
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:48,980
Speaker 1: So like if you come to rims house, they'll be like geek guests and they'll be another one, right?

790
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:57,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you come to my house same thing I got like four different wireless networks for different, you know one for me one for everyone else and then two on five gigahertz And two on the other one.

791
00:49:58,085 --> 00:50:00,473
Speaker 1: Anyway, so on the guest.

792
00:50:00,694 --> 00:50:02,360
Speaker 1: one set up a HTTP proxy.

793
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,319
Speaker 1: So anyone on that wireless LAN using that SSID all their HTTP traffic goes through the proxy.

794
00:50:09,044 --> 00:50:20,519
Speaker 1: configure that proxy so that Anybody who's using that guest network all the images on any website they visit are replaced with cats dogs goatsy, whatever.

795
00:50:22,182 --> 00:50:26,095
Speaker 1: And then invite some friends over and see how long it takes someone's like on their iPhone.

796
00:50:26,135 --> 00:50:27,500
Speaker 1: They like what's the wireless password?

797
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,121
Speaker 1: Oh, you know.

798
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:32,896
Speaker 0: so think about how this will mess them up from like a user perspective.

799
00:50:32,936 --> 00:50:38,517
Speaker 0: It won't mess up with their emails yeah, so like if they Email the link depending on how?

800
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:47,880
Speaker 1: well Yeah, it depends a lot but any HTTPS with IMG SRC any image requests that go over HTTP will return the wrong image.

801
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,690
Speaker 0: I think you'll have some high Larry is.

802
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,399
Speaker 0: some of your friends will be connected to the Wi-Fi.

803
00:50:51,842 --> 00:50:55,680
Speaker 0: Some of them probably like know your password and are connected to the real one because they're better friends.

804
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:58,411
Speaker 0: So they can even be like it's fine on my phone.

805
00:50:58,793 --> 00:50:59,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, look.

806
00:50:59,335 --> 00:50:59,596
Speaker 1: Yeah.

807
00:50:59,616 --> 00:51:00,480
Speaker 1: See it's working just fine.

808
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe you got the cat virus.

809
00:51:02,345 --> 00:51:04,651
Speaker 0: I heard that's going around tell for 50 bucks.

810
00:51:04,691 --> 00:51:05,153
Speaker 0: I'll fix it.

811
00:51:05,173 --> 00:51:09,159
Speaker 1: a Good time will be had by all.

812
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:17,990
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

813
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:22,810
Speaker 0: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
