1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,408
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday April 4th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,408 --> 00:00:12,909
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,195
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is fuck it.

4
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:15,696
Speaker 0: It's Pax.

5
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:16,297
Speaker 0: Let's just go.

6
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:18,627
Speaker 0: Okay now Pax is coming.

7
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:20,879
Speaker 0: This is the last show you'll get until we recover from Pax.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:33,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we're talking about Angry Birds space and Pax space Obligatory space joke, which we don't do that kind of joke too often because it but it's actually relevant.

9
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,911
Speaker 1: It's like it's relevant but dumb and not funny.

10
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:41,218
Speaker 1: unless you're like a 12 year old in anime convention Let's do this.

11
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:45,432
Speaker 0: It's like if the cake was actually a lie.

12
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:49,534
Speaker 0: like you get like someone says hey you want to come over I've got cake and you get there and there's no cake.

13
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:53,233
Speaker 1: you go to the bakery and they say here's a cake I give you a box.

14
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,969
Speaker 1: you open the box poop or Cupcakes or pie.

15
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,440
Speaker 0: they give you a pie by accident.

16
00:00:59,142 --> 00:00:59,764
Speaker 0: That's that those.

17
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:04,640
Speaker 0: those are the points where you can say the cake was a lie and it's it's okay.

18
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:09,679
Speaker 0: It may not be funny, but it's okay to say almost okay anyway.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,039
Speaker 0: now The only happens bad is if you're that guy you're standing in line at a con and a guy behind you is like Cake is a lie.

20
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:19,810
Speaker 0: It's like that's the most social currency that guy's got.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,298
Speaker 0: you realize that he just entered with his high note.

22
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:36,080
Speaker 1: Yep So anyway Because it's PAX is pretty much no game news because everyone's holding on to their game news until PAX and it would be redundant to Discuss any PAX news before the PAX part of the show in the news part.

23
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:39,233
Speaker 1: So all I got for you today is I'm gonna geek bite.

24
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:44,480
Speaker 1: previous thing I've discussed in the show which is that new tabletop internet TV.

25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,713
Speaker 0: That is so barely a step above my idea of making the news about PAX.

26
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:50,277
Speaker 1: I know but it's still above.

27
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:51,220
Speaker 1: it is above.

28
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:55,180
Speaker 1: I will give you that anyway, so I watched the first episode which just came out.

29
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,626
Speaker 1: Apparently there's gonna be a monthly thing.

30
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:58,273
Speaker 1: It was Wil Wheaton.

31
00:01:58,294 --> 00:02:06,320
Speaker 1: I believe you mean Some guy for Mythbusters, but it wasn't the two Mythbusters guys, it was one of the other guys.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,508
Speaker 0: Do you know the names of anyone on Mythbusters?

33
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:10,853
Speaker 1: I'm scared.

34
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:11,796
Speaker 1: mustache guy.

35
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:15,585
Speaker 1: Yeah names Just curious busters.

36
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,031
Speaker 1: other guy who I can recognize.

37
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:23,633
Speaker 1: Okay, just check but I can't describe anyway The guard Mythbusters girl who I wouldn't recognize if I bump into her on the street.

38
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:23,934
Speaker 1: Yeah.

39
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:33,598
Speaker 1: Anyway, uh some dude who was like a Starcraft commentator and This girl who I forget what she does, but she's internet II and nerdy in some way.

40
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:36,091
Speaker 1: anyway Her name was Jenna.

41
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:40,780
Speaker 1: I remember her name though I don't remember the other guys names except for Wil Wheaton because I've seen him in person anyway.

42
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:43,053
Speaker 1: So these four people get around and they play a game.

43
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:43,999
Speaker 1: a small world, right?

44
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,439
Speaker 1: Relatively high production values, you know much better than us.

45
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:53,020
Speaker 1: You know, it's not say TV quality, you know necessarily but it's you know.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,057
Speaker 1: I guess it's like cable TV quality for like middle of the day on Sunday kind of thing.

47
00:02:57,622 --> 00:02:59,739
Speaker 1: It definitely does a good job of selling the game.

48
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:02,759
Speaker 1: It felt like it did a good job of explaining the game.

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,740
Speaker 1: It's like someone who had never seen small world in their lives before But that my view on that is tainted because I already know how to play small world.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,380
Speaker 1: So like I don't know what it would have seemed like with someone who didn't understand the game at all.

51
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,205
Speaker 1: I've never seen it before.

52
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:15,874
Speaker 1: would they understand it watching the show?

53
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:16,599
Speaker 1: I don't know.

54
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:20,894
Speaker 1: They don't show you the entire playthrough because that would take a while.

55
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,520
Speaker 1: All right, and this shows only a half hour.

56
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,760
Speaker 1: They sure do show you the highlights.

57
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:35,859
Speaker 1: They also did some stuff like they put some pandemic ponds on the board so that you know to highlight the areas where the action Is you know because if you just looked at the board you and you weren't knowledgeable you might know

58
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:42,500
Speaker 0: Because we tried to do some you know do a thing and film it and then make footage after the fact.

59
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:59,180
Speaker 0: Once in the past and it was a disaster and then we watched a hodgeman do a thing and we realized that it takes so much like fakery and Repeats and effort and bullshit to make any amount of reasonable video come out of any even reasonably live event.

60
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:01,312
Speaker 0: Yep, so it's that kind of stuff.

61
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:02,378
Speaker 0: You have to do that.

62
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:04,920
Speaker 1: Yep So anyway, so they played a game a small world.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,449
Speaker 1: They explained the small world pretty well as they were playing.

64
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:10,500
Speaker 1: they explained the moves as they were making them why they were making the moves.

65
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:20,680
Speaker 1: You know, they had a lot of sidebars, you know Those kind of things they do in reality shows where it cuts away from the action and you see just one person talking to the camera Like yeah, you know, it's like they got interviewed but you don't hear the questions.

66
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:23,839
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, I made that move because blah blah blah blah blah, right?

67
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:37,159
Speaker 1: Uh overall, you know, I think the show is like if you're someone who is nerdy But you are not into the german games, you know You're the kind of person who likes you know, the sci-fis and the tv shows and whatever all this stuff that I don't like.

68
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:44,219
Speaker 1: Uh, this might do a good job of getting those people into board games and for that I think this is a good thing for it to exist.

69
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:52,514
Speaker 1: But as someone who is a hardcore already board gamer There's really no reason for me to watch the show because it's not teaching me anything.

70
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,180
Speaker 1: I already know how to play this game, right?

71
00:04:55,001 --> 00:05:03,315
Speaker 1: Uh, it's not really that funny because it seems like they're all the jokes they're making and all the table talk Is somewhat genuine but also somewhat forced are you?

72
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:04,600
Speaker 1: because they know they're on camera?

73
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,769
Speaker 1: It's not that sort of natural table talk you get.

74
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,655
Speaker 1: there's also no smack talk.

75
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:10,016
Speaker 1: like all.

76
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:14,992
Speaker 1: their smack talk is Generally, like, you know, it's very light-hearted and friendly.

77
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,179
Speaker 0: I almost I really feel like we should.

78
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,500
Speaker 0: we got enough.

79
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:21,360
Speaker 1: I think the major difference right is like when we smack talk.

80
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,554
Speaker 1: It's like winner can glow and everyone else shame.

81
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:31,200
Speaker 1: second place is the first loser Whereas they were sort of like there was a winner, but they sort of had a everyone's a winner attitude.

82
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,411
Speaker 1: I can tell the girl was like at least I beat you.

83
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,133
Speaker 1: Hahaha.

84
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:37,120
Speaker 1: I do that feeling good even though she lost.

85
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do that.

86
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,630
Speaker 0: I don't I feel good if i'm in second place.

87
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:42,040
Speaker 1: No, uh, but second place the first loser.

88
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:48,621
Speaker 0: But I know uh someone on the internet I've not seen the video yet said that they fucked up a rule and that the person who won the game only won because of That.

89
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,609
Speaker 0: fuck up.

90
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,960
Speaker 1: I didn't pay that close.

91
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,694
Speaker 0: So the ghouls apparently don't get to attack if they do their decline thing.

92
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,820
Speaker 0: That's true, but he attacked and declined.

93
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:02,555
Speaker 1: Oh, see, actually, I remember specifically that part where he goaled it up and that someone had mentioned.

94
00:06:02,576 --> 00:06:05,079
Speaker 1: Oh, man, ghouls are awesome That's what you're supposed to do with them.

95
00:06:05,402 --> 00:06:13,020
Speaker 1: And the guy was like, oh, I didn't even know that was you're supposed to do with ghouls You know, I just sort of you know, and he was like, no, that's exactly the way to use the ghouls for awesomeness.

96
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:15,009
Speaker 1: But I didn't actually pay attention apparently.

97
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,858
Speaker 0: No, that's not how the rules are.

98
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:19,574
Speaker 1: Uh, that's sort of a fail if you're making a show about a boy.

99
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:20,380
Speaker 0: No, I heard this.

100
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:22,449
Speaker 0: Like I said, I did not see the episode yet.

101
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,951
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

102
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:24,518
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's true.

103
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,142
Speaker 1: I don't know I didn't.

104
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:26,834
Speaker 1: I also didn't pay that close attention.

105
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:27,639
Speaker 1: I just remember that part.

106
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:29,663
Speaker 1: um You know.

107
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:37,220
Speaker 1: and also they weren't playing hard to win, you know It's like they were playing kind of to win but not hard to win the way we play hard to win.

108
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:53,480
Speaker 1: So if you're looking for like a competitive thing where you can root for someone to win Which is sort of what I kind of want which is you know What someone like me would be interested in it's this is not that this is for the nerd Who is not already a board gaming nerd to make you a board gaming nerd and maybe to sell you some games in that way.

109
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,244
Speaker 1: It does a good job.

110
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:54,626
Speaker 1: Now

111
00:06:54,888 --> 00:07:04,306
Speaker 0: what I would love to see is an episode of this, you know If it goes on for a while and is popular I'd love them to get a group of actually hardcore board gamers Just to just to see what I think

112
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:07,860
Speaker 1: they're mostly powering it with the fame the nerd fame of the participants

113
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,443
Speaker 0: Which is fine.

114
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:11,580
Speaker 1: I mean think about it gets the viewership to sell the games, which is good.

115
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:14,740
Speaker 0: Oh my god, if this goes well, I mean imagine if they get like nathan fillian.

116
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're basically targeting the exact right group the people who are in nerdery.

117
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:23,260
Speaker 1: They're close to board game nerds, but they're not in board game nerds.

118
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,696
Speaker 1: You know some star trek guy is close to board game nerdery.

119
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:28,162
Speaker 1: He's not far off He's you're not.

120
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:32,280
Speaker 1: we're not reaching out to you know, you know, some guy at a nascar thing, right?

121
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,774
Speaker 1: We're reaching out to someone who's close to board game nerdery But is not there yet and trying to bring him in.

122
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:38,880
Speaker 1: and that's what the show is good for.

123
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:52,532
Speaker 1: I was slightly pissed off about one thing which was I don't know if this is just an honest portrayal of the girl on the show or if it was just You know the way she was portrayed But they she seemed kind of bleh in the show like she was like.

124
00:07:52,833 --> 00:08:05,260
Speaker 1: they showed her like, you know, because it's edited right Once she made a comment like oh i'll take the sorcerers because I like to be a magic user And everyone but all the other guys are making comments like I did this because i'll get points that way.

125
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:10,480
Speaker 1: It's like whenever they cut to a guy they were commenting on why they made a strategy to win.

126
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,954
Speaker 1: When they cut to the girl she was like, I was glad I got to use the dragon.

127
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:19,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hope sincerely That that was just the way the conversations went and it was not clever editing.

128
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:24,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that would that would that would actually be the worst possible thing if that was just clever editing.

129
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:28,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the girl also got the lowest score, you know, she wasn't that much lower.

130
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,115
Speaker 1: Well, obviously listen how she was playing right but it's like, you know, was that?

131
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:33,259
Speaker 1: you know, was that?

132
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:42,219
Speaker 1: Person right this jenna girl who I don't you know, remember what she does, but she's some semi-fame internet famous nerd Was she just not?

133
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:46,683
Speaker 1: You know, she was you know newer to the game than the other people obviously But it's like.

134
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:51,040
Speaker 1: was she just that way and that was honest portrayal or was it, you know?

135
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,747
Speaker 0: Well, there's a couple of possibilities.

136
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:55,060
Speaker 0: was she playing a persona?

137
00:08:55,841 --> 00:09:00,160
Speaker 0: That's also true or was it edited to make her look like that?

138
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,824
Speaker 1: I think that you know and it's like, you know, it can't it's unless it was edited by you know Someone to make it look like that.

139
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:10,476
Speaker 1: It's obviously not sexist especially could be an honest portrayal of her.

140
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:18,380
Speaker 1: but in which case You know, maybe not have people like that representing the ladies, you know get someone on there who's gonna?

141
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, can you imagine roe on a show like that?

142
00:09:20,348 --> 00:09:21,833
Speaker 1: Exactly, which is what the fuck?

143
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,560
Speaker 1: Give me that motherfucking cocoa bean.

144
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:24,204
Speaker 1: That's right.

145
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:29,914
Speaker 1: You know you get get nuri on there Right, you know the girls we know are not like that.

146
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:34,743
Speaker 1: the girls we know are like Smack you down and take all them points Right.

147
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:38,600
Speaker 1: So that's right, you know, and I know there are some semi-famous nerd girls who are like that.

148
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:42,100
Speaker 1: Veronica Belmont's pretty hardcore and i'm pretty sure she'll be on the show at some point.

149
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,135
Speaker 0: Well, let's do our.

150
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:46,980
Speaker 0: you know This is really shit talk one of our board game nights when it's just the hardcore people.

151
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:48,064
Speaker 0: Or maybe a pax.

152
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:52,500
Speaker 0: i'll get some video of what the frc the core the real frc is actually like.

153
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,400
Speaker 1: Let's film like an entire game of something that's not eclipse.

154
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,070
Speaker 0: We got enough hard drive space for eclipse almost almost.

155
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:02,100
Speaker 1: i'm just saying we'd have enough battery power for a clip.

156
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,870
Speaker 1: Let's get like a one hour game and film it.

157
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:08,966
Speaker 1: and you know, here's the two games Something like a grickle of puerto rico size.

158
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:17,120
Speaker 0: I would do puerto rico and bonanza because they show two different kinds of games Because i'm not yelling at the top of my lungs at puerto rico.

159
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want to film something that's like, you know soft like apple stacks apples or dixit, you know I want to film something.

160
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:26,555
Speaker 1: that's a hard game a strategy of winning, you know, but isn't too long.

161
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:27,780
Speaker 0: is dixit often soft?

162
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:29,917
Speaker 1: Yeah, dixits are pretty soft.

163
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:39,785
Speaker 0: So I gotta preface my news because there's a lot to say here and it's unfortunate that the article about it appeared on april 1st But I didn't.

164
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,737
Speaker 0: i'm assuming it's not in april fools.

165
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:42,160
Speaker 0: But anyway.

166
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,676
Speaker 0: So you may or may not if you play chess be familiar with the king's gambit.

167
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:51,520
Speaker 0: It's one of the openings Of of chess, you know, i'm not familiar with it.

168
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:56,668
Speaker 1: I know how to play chess, but i'm not familiar with any of the strategies Or anything like that.

169
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,378
Speaker 0: I don't enjoy chess, but I don't enjoy it.

170
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:02,571
Speaker 1: for the same I don't hate it, but I don't go out of my way to play.

171
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:09,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't enjoy chess for the same reason I don't enjoy Rts's or necessarily street fighter 4.

172
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,974
Speaker 1: I reinstalled starcraft.

173
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:10,958
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give it another go.

174
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,330
Speaker 0: I'm, i'm not like.

175
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,460
Speaker 0: i'm not at that level.

176
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:23,413
Speaker 0: I haven't memorized enough stuff But I know enough to be dangerous because when I was in high school one of my friends was a straight up chess Master and I played with him like all the time.

177
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:28,896
Speaker 0: I don't think I ever fucking beat him but I learned a lot and i'd often actually start with a polish opening.

178
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:32,980
Speaker 0: but uh, The king's gambit and i'll link i'm going to link to a bunch of stuff.

179
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,140
Speaker 0: You can actually step through what the king's gambit is and actually wikipedia.

180
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:37,443
Speaker 1: You know what?

181
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:40,319
Speaker 0: I'm going to read what wikipedia says because it says it better than I can.

182
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:48,654
Speaker 0: The king's gambit was one of the most popular openings for over 300 years in chess Has been played by many of its strongest players, uh, blah blah blah blah.

183
00:11:48,854 --> 00:12:00,615
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of people writing about it And basically this was a very popular opening until uh, bobby fisher Uh who if you don't know who he is, that's a whole other.

184
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:04,270
Speaker 0: let's not discuss that now Let's just say that that's a rabbit hole.

185
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,476
Speaker 0: You can follow on wikipedia.

186
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:06,420
Speaker 1: You can watch the movie.

187
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:14,884
Speaker 0: So bobby fisher interesting dude published an article interesting a bust to the king's gambit in which he basically said It's stupid.

188
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:15,506
Speaker 0: Don't do it.

189
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:16,228
Speaker 0: Uh, it's.

190
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:19,379
Speaker 0: it always loses and there's a lot of arguments back and forth.

191
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:29,382
Speaker 0: So a dude vazic rajlik Claims to have a weak proof that it is in fact a losing gamble for white The.

192
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:31,280
Speaker 0: the actual king's gambit is pretty straightforward.

193
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,768
Speaker 0: So what you do is white moves.

194
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:37,200
Speaker 0: I won't use chess terminology in case you guys don't know what that means.

195
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:41,391
Speaker 0: He takes the pawn in front of his king moves it up to okay.

196
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:52,816
Speaker 0: if black wants to accept the gambit They take their black pawn in front of their king and put him two spaces forward the queen Because they're on the opposite side.

197
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:55,655
Speaker 0: uh No, they're not.

198
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:04,105
Speaker 1: Yes Yeah, I think I have.

199
00:13:11,702 --> 00:13:16,348
Speaker 1: Okay, so I think I just discovered That i've been setting up chess boards wrong my whole life.

200
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:20,780
Speaker 0: You were so genuinely startled that I had to second guess myself.

201
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:21,849
Speaker 1: It's i'm not see now.

202
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:26,339
Speaker 1: I haven't played chess in so long So I don't even know if it's accurate like if it's just my memory is fucked up.

203
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:28,847
Speaker 1: But I was i'm pretty sure my whole life.

204
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:32,700
Speaker 1: i've set up chess boards where the queen is opposite the king and vice versa.

205
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:42,039
Speaker 1: So it's it's a diagonal, you know, it's symmetric But this one has both kings on one side of both and it must be correct if it's on wikipedia Kings on the right both queens on the left.

206
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:46,439
Speaker 1: Now I don't even remember If i've been playing right or wrong.

207
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:50,340
Speaker 0: uh That's that's amazing.

208
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,620
Speaker 1: Scott here is a picture of a but if you if you asked me to set up a chess board today.

209
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:57,879
Speaker 1: I would have set it up not according to that picture.

210
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:04,616
Speaker 0: so Yeah, and that's that's uh, that's uh something that's that's something indeed.

211
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:11,214
Speaker 1: Yeah Alrighty Yeah, I just you know, but the thing is right.

212
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:14,670
Speaker 1: Um Why not play it that way?

213
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:23,712
Speaker 0: Uh, all right, so the queen now Facing the other person's king, but your queen is also facing the other person's king also Yeah, so the game devolves immediately.

214
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:29,108
Speaker 0: In fact, it's probably Pretty directly solvable if the game's like that.

215
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:29,549
Speaker 0: I don't know.

216
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,280
Speaker 0: it cuts down on the decision tree to a ludicrous anyway experiment.

217
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:36,918
Speaker 0: that was so the king's game.

218
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:46,880
Speaker 0: So you take the pawn in front of your king put him up to The other person puts their pawn in front of their king up to pawn against pawn pawn against pawn white.

219
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,921
Speaker 0: Then moves the kid the pawn to the right in front of their white bishop up to So.

220
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:59,056
Speaker 1: so this only situation only happens if all if both players agree and do those three moves.

221
00:14:59,096 --> 00:14:59,477
Speaker 1: if anyone

222
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:00,239
Speaker 0: kind of like if

223
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,366
Speaker 1: I Like if anyone deviates

224
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:07,281
Speaker 0: and you block it in a way that I know you're gonna block it and we get into this pattern Right,

225
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:13,560
Speaker 1: so it's all if anyone deviates from this at all in any way that it everything it doesn't matter It's not the king's gambit.

226
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:21,978
Speaker 0: So a lot of people, you know chess unlike checkers checkers has a weak mathematical solution from many years ago And it'll probably have a complete mathematical solution soon.

227
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:24,085
Speaker 0: Uh, both sides can force the draw.

228
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:25,930
Speaker 0: so fuck check fuck checkers done game.

229
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:29,180
Speaker 0: But anyway chess is orders of magnitude more complex.

230
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,394
Speaker 0: So we're not going to have a complete solution to chess anytime soon though.

231
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:34,499
Speaker 0: I'll bet we will within the next 20 years.

232
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:45,300
Speaker 0: So what this guy did is constrained his brute forcing to just The follow-up to the king's gambit to try to figure out if the king's gambit is a worthwhile opening or not.

233
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:54,396
Speaker 1: So that's a very, you know, if you assume those three opening moves, uh, it's still basically unsolvable with modern computers Still is unsolvable, but you still have exp even though it's unsolvable.

234
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:58,954
Speaker 1: There's still a Gigantic number of strategies that follow from those three moves.

235
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:02,890
Speaker 1: It is still Exponentially less than the full game of chess.

236
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:05,020
Speaker 0: So he did a number of things.

237
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,789
Speaker 1: It's sort of like let's map every star in the universe.

238
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,592
Speaker 1: That's too hard.

239
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:10,700
Speaker 1: All right, let's map every star in the galaxy.

240
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,715
Speaker 1: That is sure go for it.

241
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:16,088
Speaker 0: That is Almost just as hard on the scale of infinity.

242
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:17,031
Speaker 0: Exactly, right?

243
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:20,060
Speaker 0: But it's like all right, i've got infinity and you've got infinity over two.

244
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,189
Speaker 1: Well, good job, dude.

245
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,053
Speaker 1: Yeah That's basically what's going on here.

246
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:26,342
Speaker 0: So What they?

247
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,127
Speaker 0: they analyze this they this guy.

248
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:32,020
Speaker 0: now I want to pause here to point out something that makes us even crazier.

249
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:44,107
Speaker 0: This guy was on slashdot before For plagiarizing gnu chess and another chess program in his own chess program And he's kind of hated by a lot of people.

250
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:48,100
Speaker 0: All right, but apparently his and he was disqualified from some big competition.

251
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,479
Speaker 1: So this is a sketchy chess dude, but you know what?

252
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:54,835
Speaker 1: Even though he may be sketchy in those ways, it's not as bad as the way he's bobby fisher.

253
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:56,300
Speaker 0: Oh my god, bobby fisher.

254
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:57,551
Speaker 0: All right, just watch the movie.

255
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:03,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, so anyway Uh, his solution is not even a weak mathematical proof.

256
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:15,460
Speaker 0: What it is is a statistical analysis of all the possible moves that pruned Branches where white had not white where black in this case had an overwhelming majority.

257
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:20,680
Speaker 0: Basically it proved any branch that was highly likely to not result in any different behavior.

258
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:30,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if like, you know if he was going down one road one pattern of moves and it was looking like you know White had like a handful of pieces left and black had a whole bunch.

259
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,500
Speaker 1: It's like okay don't even bother calculating the rest of those patterns.

260
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:39,380
Speaker 1: We we can move on to other patterns that are more likely to be you know winners for the other side, right?

261
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:47,700
Speaker 1: So that you know Basically calculating as few patterns as possible when the probability of finding anything down that road is not looking too good.

262
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:50,297
Speaker 0: So there are a couple of moves.

263
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:55,160
Speaker 0: basically Uh, i'm debating whether or not I should actually tell you what the uh answer is or I should make you go to this website.

264
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:56,684
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

265
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,066
Speaker 1: You know what.

266
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:58,171
Speaker 0: go to the website and read it.

267
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,999
Speaker 0: the website explains how the guy did it.

268
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:01,047
Speaker 0: All the it's.

269
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:07,260
Speaker 0: it's a really interesting article That covers this is kind of how we try to solve board games.

270
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:18,296
Speaker 0: Just board games that we play have such a constrained decision space compared to chess or go That they're actually much more eminently solvable even by a human with a pen and paper and a calculator.

271
00:18:18,316 --> 00:18:18,678
Speaker 1: some of them.

272
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:22,340
Speaker 1: Yeah Uh, you know, maybe not something like a curricula with a zillion cards.

273
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,536
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is what humans are good at is pruning Branches of things that are highly likely to not pan out.

274
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:32,357
Speaker 1: Yeah But the thing is sometimes there's an awesome gem down those roads.

275
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:37,580
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, but yeah now i'm just waiting for the forum to go and make fun of me for not knowing how to set up a Chest.

276
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:41,796
Speaker 0: that's fine because the beatles is like a music note like a beat as opposed to the bargain.

277
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,682
Speaker 0: That's right here I'll i'll.

278
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:45,970
Speaker 0: i'll read the uh, the sentence from wikipedia.

279
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,154
Speaker 0: two sentences from wikipedia.

280
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,057
Speaker 0: three sentences.

281
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:48,599
Speaker 0: four.

282
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:55,805
Speaker 0: Uh, blah blah blah claim to have proven it to a 99.9999999 Confidence level.

283
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,939
Speaker 0: the fisher's article was nearly but not entirely correct.

284
00:18:58,643 --> 00:18:59,688
Speaker 0: Uh, blah blah blah.

285
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:13,519
Speaker 0: the search concluded that after accepting the gambit black can force a win against all white responses except A set of three highly unusual responses that at best allow white to force a draw.

286
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:20,200
Speaker 0: So the moral The king's gambit is the fool's errand.

287
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,639
Speaker 1: So if you're white don't make your first move moving the white pawn in front of the king to forward.

288
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,245
Speaker 1: now Something else.

289
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:28,591
Speaker 0: here's the problem with this.

290
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:34,055
Speaker 0: This is all assuming perfect play but in history the king's gambit has been very powerful.

291
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:41,800
Speaker 0: and uh The article actually points out that if you study games black tends to fuck up first compared to white just in real play.

292
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:44,819
Speaker 0: Like they'll make a theoretical mistake earlier in their play.

293
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:49,880
Speaker 0: So if you're playing white against a novice the king's gambit might do better than average, right?

294
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,760
Speaker 1: But the thing is even if you do it against a novice, right?

295
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,872
Speaker 1: So white is professional black is novice white knows this.

296
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:57,800
Speaker 1: white knows the king's gambit stupid.

297
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Speaker 1: But he also knows that against novices is powerful because the other guy's gonna screw up which will make it not suck, right?

298
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,049
Speaker 1: So he moves that white pawn to forward from in front of his king.

299
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:10,185
Speaker 1: The novice isn't gonna do know to do this The same thing.

300
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:13,763
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that move of the pawn is a pretty powerful position in and of itself It is.

301
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:16,680
Speaker 1: but i'm just saying the other guy's not gonna be smart enough to do the same thing.

302
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,865
Speaker 0: But he could do anything.

303
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,030
Speaker 1: he might move the knight first.

304
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,552
Speaker 1: who knows?

305
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:23,280
Speaker 0: I prefer the polish opening Even though I don't believe it's terrible.

306
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:30,260
Speaker 0: I don't think many people use it anymore But I use it partly because I tend to play against novices and they won't notice the power of my bishop.

307
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:35,089
Speaker 0: You know what I do in chess most of the time play randomly until they only have a few pieces left And then hold out to the bitter end.

308
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:35,715
Speaker 1: not at all.

309
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:36,239
Speaker 0: force a draw.

310
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,685
Speaker 0: No first you want to.

311
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:40,796
Speaker 0: you want to move the king in move the rook out castle.

312
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:41,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

313
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:48,140
Speaker 1: I don't know any of the names of any moves or anything like that or any patterns, but you're not a castle.

314
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:49,788
Speaker 1: I just know all the moves here.

315
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,239
Speaker 1: I just know the rules except for how to set up a board properly.

316
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,571
Speaker 0: Do you know all the rules scott?

317
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:55,859
Speaker 0: Do you know about en passant?

318
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:58,464
Speaker 1: What are all the ways?

319
00:20:58,484 --> 00:21:03,240
Speaker 0: i've heard that before what are all the ways a pawn can capture a piece?

320
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,746
Speaker 1: Uh, you can go diagonal yeah, or Diagonal onto the piece, right?

321
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:14,179
Speaker 0: There is one other very specific situation where a pawn can take a piece without moving on to it.

322
00:21:15,284 --> 00:21:17,435
Speaker 1: Uh, yo when you're in front of it you move diagonal.

323
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:18,299
Speaker 1: it's like the side of it.

324
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:19,879
Speaker 0: But when can you do this?

325
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:26,220
Speaker 1: You can do it When you're like all when the guy's still in like his original place like all the way on the other end, right?

326
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,691
Speaker 1: Or something like that right now.

327
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,906
Speaker 1: No, no There's a time you can do it.

328
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:36,289
Speaker 0: It has to do when when it's only another pawn Yeah, yeah, not not if he's in his original place.

329
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,820
Speaker 1: Anyway, so anyway, but I know how all the guys move and such.

330
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,187
Speaker 1: So what I usually do is I move the candidates first because they move all cool And they get to jump over shit.

331
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:47,476
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically so it's sort of like I get to send.

332
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:49,023
Speaker 1: it sort of feels good Right.

333
00:21:49,064 --> 00:21:50,031
Speaker 1: This is how I play chess.

334
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:51,824
Speaker 1: Obviously, i'm not great my understanding.

335
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:58,300
Speaker 1: it feels good to move them out because you can still leave your army of Pawns up there and it feels like you're keeping your armor on while sending out missiles.

336
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,683
Speaker 0: You know what?

337
00:21:58,703 --> 00:21:59,851
Speaker 1: You sound like hiding behind the shield.

338
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:01,100
Speaker 0: Here's what you sound like man.

339
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,912
Speaker 0: I really liked just hadouken all the time because it really works.

340
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:08,437
Speaker 1: I'm really glad I got to use the dragon And I like sorcerers because I like to be a magic user.

341
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:11,706
Speaker 0: A thousand hand slap.

342
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,631
Speaker 0: i'll just use it all day.

343
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:13,394
Speaker 1: I know right?

344
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:14,118
Speaker 1: What what what what?

345
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,796
Speaker 0: Okay I'll just sometimes i'll just back up in the corner and do it.

346
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:18,818
Speaker 0: Yep In fact, I go for that.

347
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:28,915
Speaker 0: Okay So things of the day.

348
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:32,527
Speaker 0: natural selection 2 as you know has gotten to the point where it's.

349
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:33,450
Speaker 0: it's playable.

350
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:35,229
Speaker 0: I've been playing it a lot.

351
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:38,978
Speaker 0: I Really like natural selection.

352
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:40,244
Speaker 1: Well, except it's still laggy.

353
00:22:40,284 --> 00:22:41,530
Speaker 1: if they fix the lag, it'd be great.

354
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,777
Speaker 0: And I really like natural selection too.

355
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:49,870
Speaker 0: It's like 80 there to be in my go-to non counter-strike non tribes 2 game fps.

356
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,840
Speaker 0: but One interesting thing is that it's still in beta.

357
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,649
Speaker 0: i'm not going to talk about all the stuff around ns2.

358
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:04,191
Speaker 0: I'm going to link to a video showing how wall jumping works for skulks as of beta 201.

359
00:23:04,191 --> 00:23:07,584
Speaker 1: Because this I think they just released 203 which is the pex build.

360
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:08,607
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

361
00:23:08,627 --> 00:23:13,916
Speaker 1: There's a 203 They're gonna have a they're gonna have a big They're gonna have a big pex booth They're all gonna be there.

362
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:23,463
Speaker 1: so we can harass them and say hey Stop fixing this other shit like skull jumping and fix the lag because it doesn't matter how good the scope junking is If there's lag the skull jumping is pretty great.

363
00:23:23,563 --> 00:23:26,750
Speaker 0: It is great though, and I I don't know what else I can say.

364
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,448
Speaker 0: But if you watch this i'm gonna say a few things that a few forum eyes got pissed off about.

365
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:32,336
Speaker 0: but the rest of you whatever.

366
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:37,789
Speaker 0: one Uh, see that constantly pulls up and see all those debug things he turns on.

367
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:40,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's in real pc games too.

368
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:42,505
Speaker 0: So, uh, fuck your xbox.

369
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:43,208
Speaker 0: That's right.

370
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:54,862
Speaker 0: and two Uh, I would love to see a game be able to implement something like this the way that it is implemented With the skill set that implements it with anything other than a mouse and keyboard.

371
00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:57,650
Speaker 1: Oh rims bringing out the mouse keyboard smackdown.

372
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,854
Speaker 1: That's usually my job.

373
00:23:59,115 --> 00:23:59,235
Speaker 0: Now.

374
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:03,450
Speaker 0: It is not the best way for all first person view games.

375
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:07,378
Speaker 1: But for games that test metroid prime, right metroid prime Yeah.

376
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:17,447
Speaker 0: But for games that test these kinds of skills that are designed to be this kind of game There is no better way to play it short of some sort of like vr helmet display that we are.

377
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:21,018
Speaker 0: Oh my god I was thinking about vr5.

378
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:23,986
Speaker 0: I watched that show from day one till the end on tv.

379
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:28,698
Speaker 0: You know what vr5 is i've heard of.

380
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,169
Speaker 0: there's vr1 vr2 vr3 vr4 and then there's like vr7 where they talk to dead people.

381
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:42,390
Speaker 1: man I used to watch all these stupid shows on tv that looked all kind of sci-fi technology like but were kind of just dumb Yep, crap and they all got cancelled like you were watching mantis.

382
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:45,663
Speaker 0: I didn't watch it because it was always on sci-fi.

383
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:47,632
Speaker 1: while I was waiting for something else to come on I wasn't on side.

384
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,879
Speaker 1: I watched it on network tv.

385
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,502
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

386
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:50,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like I watched reruns.

387
00:24:51,050 --> 00:25:00,218
Speaker 1: It was about like this crippled dude, but he had like an exoskeleton Armor thing that he would put on to go, you know, do do goody stuff Uh, and he was awesome.

388
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:01,083
Speaker 1: And then there was viper.

389
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:02,250
Speaker 1: There was a guy with an awesome car.

390
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:07,823
Speaker 1: It was like a rip-off of night rider But it sucked and it was mostly a dodge viper ad.

391
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:09,370
Speaker 0: I watched night rider.

392
00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:11,880
Speaker 1: Well night rider is actually good.

393
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:12,323
Speaker 0: Is it?

394
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:13,349
Speaker 0: is it the hoff?

395
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:14,630
Speaker 0: When?

396
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:19,006
Speaker 0: so it's good, but it's good in a in a particular better than he-man.

397
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:22,820
Speaker 0: Uh You could say that about almost every.

398
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,810
Speaker 0: i'm just saying act of human.

399
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,266
Speaker 1: There are a lot of things you have nostalgia for that are worse than night rider.

400
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:29,230
Speaker 0: That is true.

401
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:30,699
Speaker 0: I have yet to find anything.

402
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,490
Speaker 0: I had nostalgia for that was worse.

403
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:37,190
Speaker 0: The disparity between what I remembered and what it was for he-man was literally the worst of anything ever.

404
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:43,010
Speaker 1: There are other things that weren't necessarily sci-fi directly, but they had sci-fi stuff like briscoe county got cancelled.

405
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,596
Speaker 0: I like briscoe county jr.

406
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:45,480
Speaker 1: And what was the other one?

407
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,147
Speaker 0: It was like there was young indiana jones.

408
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:47,850
Speaker 1: That was awful.

409
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:49,917
Speaker 1: Uh, there was the something.

410
00:25:49,977 --> 00:25:50,599
Speaker 1: there was the something.

411
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:52,686
Speaker 1: something lives of so and so.

412
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:53,850
Speaker 1: or it was like the guy.

413
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,425
Speaker 1: Did he have a genie or I can't remember what the name of this was.

414
00:25:56,445 --> 00:25:57,170
Speaker 0: I dream of genie.

415
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,577
Speaker 1: No, I dream of genie's.

416
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:00,870
Speaker 0: good though, um, not as good as bewitched.

417
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:03,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like the something.

418
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:04,603
Speaker 1: something lives of something.

419
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:05,950
Speaker 1: something mainly because the guy was stupid.

420
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,530
Speaker 1: I think he was like I have an all-powerful and loyal girlfriend.

421
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,710
Speaker 1: It was like about a guy who was like cursed and he had to save some number of lives.

422
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,937
Speaker 0: Uh mcgyver.

423
00:26:13,957 --> 00:26:19,181
Speaker 1: No mcgyver wasn't cursed It was a guy had to save some number of people's lives.

424
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:21,128
Speaker 1: He lived in like a mansion or something.

425
00:26:21,691 --> 00:26:23,116
Speaker 0: And okay, so not quantum league.

426
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:24,201
Speaker 1: It was like a disney show.

427
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:25,084
Speaker 1: It was on ebc.

428
00:26:25,104 --> 00:26:26,530
Speaker 0: I have no idea what you're talking about.

429
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,137
Speaker 0: I gotta find.

430
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:29,221
Speaker 1: I think it's like the 99 lives.

431
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:30,085
Speaker 0: I said mcgyver.

432
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:33,019
Speaker 0: I was thinking quantum leap I like mcgyver.

433
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:35,937

434
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:37,623
Speaker 0: Did you see the mcgyver movie?

435
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:39,390
Speaker 1: No, I didn't even know there's such a thing to exist.

436
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:40,200
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty good.

437
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,608
Speaker 1: I think See now I can't remember how many lives it was.

438
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:46,049
Speaker 0: Well, anyway, what's your thing of the day?

439
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:57,810
Speaker 1: Oh, so usually right I hate april fool's day because april fool's day has become not a day of fooling uh people or pranking people but a day of let's ruin our website.

440
00:26:58,454 --> 00:27:00,746
Speaker 0: Now some of those things are cool like the google 8-bit thing.

441
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,410
Speaker 0: I thought was really cool.

442
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,601
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of the things are cool, but they're not april fools.

443
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:04,284
Speaker 0: Exactly.

444
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:08,830
Speaker 0: We have two holidays We have fuck the internet day and we have april fool's day.

445
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,043
Speaker 1: I was very happy that april fool's day landed on a sunday this year.

446
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:16,437
Speaker 0: I was very unhappy because I pull shit every year on april fool's day.

447
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:21,158
Speaker 0: But if i'm at home alone rendering video for packs and anime boston There's no one to fool.

448
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:22,710
Speaker 1: Well, that's actually fooling i'm talking about.

449
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:35,827
Speaker 1: I was glad for the internet because it meant that a A lot of websites those people aren't working sunday and this will usually internet activity goes way down on the weekend Which meant less bullshit internet faking activity less fake news stories and nonsense.

450
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:42,029
Speaker 1: good Uh, you know, but at the same time it meant that well, you know, you're internetting less on sunday.

451
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:47,110
Speaker 1: So if there are any good things that are fake you might miss them, right?

452
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:53,010
Speaker 1: Uh so far from what I can tell there was only one good thing that was on the internet in april fool's day.

Speaker 1: Now it's on youtube.

455
00:27:59,493 --> 00:28:02,090

00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:38,205

577
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,750
Speaker 0: he's talking about early dnd.

578
00:34:40,632 --> 00:34:41,748
Speaker 0: It is way fun.

579
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:48,030
Speaker 0: It is just not the kind of game people try to make dnd Play it by the book and it is a way fun game in and of itself.

580
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:50,248
Speaker 1: I really always want to play it by the book, but no one else does.

581
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:55,226
Speaker 0: So overlapping with that at the penny arcade expo at six o'clock p.m.

582
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:59,309
Speaker 0: We are doing motivational anime at anime boston.

583
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:05,190
Speaker 0: It is we're talking about like initial d and drops of god and all that stuff.

584
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:10,803
Speaker 1: You know how when you read those shonen mangas that are about a thing Like golf or something and it makes you really want to do that thing.

585
00:35:10,924 --> 00:35:12,190
Speaker 0: Maybe if you shouldn't do that thing.

586
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're talking about all those.

587
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:26,550
Speaker 0: and then right after that in the same room We're doing diamonds in the rough all the all the anime that either was just shy of glory But you should watch anyway or the anime that is perfect for you, but you would never even think to watch.

588
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,962
Speaker 1: This is all early saturday, right?

589
00:35:28,588 --> 00:35:29,973
Speaker 0: Uh 6 p.m.

590

Speaker 0: And 7 30 p.m.

591
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:31,457
Speaker 0: Are those two?

592
00:35:31,557 --> 00:35:32,159
Speaker 1: Oh and saturday?

593
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:32,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

594
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,445
Speaker 0: Okay, that's it on saturday.

595
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:36,130
Speaker 0: All right on sunday.

596
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:42,208
Speaker 0: Uh jungle adventure and z ward two uh parsley games are at 2 p.m.

00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:46,350
Speaker 0: And 4 p.m respectively in the workshop theater going late sunday.

598
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, we will be at the omegathon finale.

599
00:35:48,677 --> 00:35:52,308
Speaker 0: That's right after getting some uh, some tasty brunch.

600
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:52,949
Speaker 0: That's right.

601
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:55,449
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh pax.

602
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,710
Speaker 1: Uh, I feel like there's just so much going on the weekend.

603
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:05,336
Speaker 1: I'm, not gonna have enough time to do the everything I want to do which is making me almost be like no Don't worry.

604
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:06,430
Speaker 1: We need a fourth day.

605
00:36:06,672 --> 00:36:09,090
Speaker 0: There's another pax in like six months and you know what?

606
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,290
Speaker 1: Not that long after that is magfest at least that pax won't have an enemy of boston at the same time or anything like that.

607
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:17,804
Speaker 0: Oh my god, if it does well, we'll deal with it All right.

608
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:26,755
Speaker 0: So angry birds space It's pretty fun It's pretty good, uh It's about the same.

609
00:36:26,775 --> 00:36:27,378
Speaker 0: I don't know.

610
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:30,310
Speaker 0: I enjoy it in the same way that I enjoyed the original angry birds.

611
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:37,290
Speaker 0: I find myself playing it When i'm pooping when i'm waiting for the subway to take me somewhere while i'm listening to a podcast.

612
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:38,779
Speaker 1: That's the same time i'm playing.

613
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,510
Speaker 1: actually I beat it beat it.

614
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,280
Speaker 0: I am most of the way through the ice world because I haven't played it that much.

615
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,648
Speaker 1: Well beat it depends on what you.

616
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:47,014
Speaker 1: uh, You know scott.

617
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:50,370
Speaker 0: I mean clearly you've gotten three stars on everything and all the golden eggs.

618
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:54,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, no i've never done that nor would I. no I know people who have.

619
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,116
Speaker 1: It's the thing about angry birds.

620
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:58,890
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you can sort of play it any way you want, right?

621
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,282
Speaker 1: You know some people they just play it to beat all the levels.

622
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:02,905
Speaker 1: That's what I do.

623
00:37:02,925 --> 00:37:08,809
Speaker 1: All right other people Uh, they actually play and they try to get three stars and everything and it's like are you kidding me?

624
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,657
Speaker 1: That would take so much time Forget it.

625
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:13,490
Speaker 0: What are you just terrible at angry birds?

626
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,095
Speaker 1: Maybe if I had see is the thing.

627
00:37:15,556 --> 00:37:16,721
Speaker 1: i'm playing it on an iphone.

628
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:19,270
Speaker 1: you're playing it on your you know, nexus s right?

629
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:24,603
Speaker 1: If you were playing it on A tablet like an ipad.

630
00:37:24,664 --> 00:37:25,350
Speaker 1: It's so much bigger.

631
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:27,883
Speaker 1: You have so much more precision in the control.

632
00:37:27,943 --> 00:37:29,330
Speaker 1: because you have such a larger area.

633
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:31,177
Speaker 1: It's like lower mouse sensitivity.

634
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,230
Speaker 0: So scott if you want to do it, you can actually get a much higher score.

635
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,537
Speaker 1: I think scott you want to really do it with iphone.

636
00:37:36,578 --> 00:37:39,507
Speaker 0: play the html5 version on a pc.

637
00:37:39,587 --> 00:37:42,406
Speaker 1: That's right mouse You could you could click click.

638
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:48,510
Speaker 1: Yep That's the the way to get the highest score, but I don't think that they have an html5 version of anger bird space.

639
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,820
Speaker 0: So i've never paid for an angry birds.

640
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,970
Speaker 0: i'm just playing the one where occasionally a stupid ad pops up.

641
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,796
Speaker 1: No, I always pay.

642
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:55,850
Speaker 1: it's a one dollar right and I think about it.

643
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,638
Speaker 1: I'm, like should I pay the one dollar?

644
00:37:58,181 --> 00:37:59,809
Speaker 1: and then I think about it and i'm like, you know what?

645
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,737
Speaker 1: Uh, i've thrown away a dollar.

646
00:38:02,798 --> 00:38:05,790
Speaker 1: like isn't even a bagel and it's like I bought a bagel this morning.

647
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:08,950
Speaker 1: It's like what am I getting more pleasure from that bagel that I got from a street cart?

648
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,420
Speaker 1: For a dollar or so scott is angry birds the new.

649
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:15,390
Speaker 1: uh, so it's worth it for me to buy the bagel for a dollar.

650
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,514
Speaker 1: It's worth it to buy anger birds.

651
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:18,381
Speaker 0: It's got the deli that opened up downstairs.

652
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:27,969
Speaker 0: I can get a breakfast that is like Pancake home fries some meat like bacon or sausage and coffee or juice for like for exactly two dollars.

653
00:38:28,612 --> 00:38:29,656
Speaker 0: Two dollars.

654
00:38:29,736 --> 00:38:30,239
Speaker 0: Yeah.

655
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:33,010
Speaker 0: Oh my two motherfucking dollars.

656
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:37,325
Speaker 1: Oh my god, because like for me I go get bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel.

657
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:38,911
Speaker 1: That's 345.

658
00:38:38,911 --> 00:38:41,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, the place downstairs is uh way cheap.

659
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:42,905
Speaker 1: Is it good?

660
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:44,029
Speaker 0: I don't know.

661
00:38:45,653 --> 00:38:48,596
Speaker 0: The uh lunch is okay, though Even so right.

662
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:56,410
Speaker 1: if i'm gonna spend two dollars on that even though that might be good I can send two dollars in that you're not gonna play with that food while you're pooping.

663
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:58,565
Speaker 0: And that is where angry birds fills a niche.

664
00:38:58,686 --> 00:38:59,149
Speaker 1: That's right.

665
00:38:59,915 --> 00:39:01,649
Speaker 0: Angry birds is just this nice.

666
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:02,873
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't know.

667
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:09,090
Speaker 0: confluence of good character design with simple gameplay and a really effective pricing and marketing model.

668
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:09,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

669
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,660
Speaker 1: it's also You know, it's sort of in this weird in-between space right like.

670
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,750
Speaker 1: it's not stupid farmville where you're not actually doing anything.

671
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,885
Speaker 1: You're just clicking and upgrading things with no skill or knowledge, right?

672
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:21,010
Speaker 0: It is a game of skill.

673
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:22,049
Speaker 1: there is but it's a very.

674
00:39:22,672 --> 00:39:25,823
Speaker 1: The skill matters only a little bit right because it's a little bit.

675
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:30,690
Speaker 1: it's mostly problem solving skill Which is where should I shoot which bird in which direction?

676
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,293
Speaker 1: To you know.

677
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:40,803
Speaker 1: get the most damage done, you know, so that all the pigs are destroyed by the time i'm done with these birds You know, so you started to figure it out based on the lay of the land.

678
00:39:40,863 --> 00:39:44,669
Speaker 0: it taps into that the same urge That makes you smash a lego thing as soon as you build it.

679
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:47,530
Speaker 1: But there is some sort of randomness and luck, right?

680
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,238
Speaker 1: You'll do the same exact thing three or four times But you'll be slightly off a little bit.

681
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:56,010
Speaker 1: and it makes all the difference in the world because of the physics engine Is so, you know, it's the box 2d physics engine.

682
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:56,411
Speaker 1: So it's.

683
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:02,730
Speaker 1: it's not some precise thing where there is an exact answer and you can do the exact same move over and over again.

684
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:12,206
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you'll do the exact same strategy and you just happen to hit like a micro spec higher And that causes a boulder to fall a different direction.

685
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:12,970
Speaker 0: timing matters.

686
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:18,130
Speaker 0: One extra dynamite goes off in the new angry bird space than the old one because there are things that move.

687
00:40:18,453 --> 00:40:19,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, and i've watched him just keep moving.

688
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,130
Speaker 0: I've had to time my birds around like I bust something and it's like wagging back and forth.

689
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,355
Speaker 0: I got to shoot a bird over it.

690
00:40:25,596 --> 00:40:27,403
Speaker 1: There's also a lot of situations.

691
00:40:27,464 --> 00:40:29,050
Speaker 1: the gravity is the biggest thing, right?

692
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,692
Speaker 1: Not you think.

693
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:34,327
Speaker 1: obviously the gravity of the planets affects the trajectory of the birds orbiting the planets.

694
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:35,190
Speaker 1: doing a slingshot.

695
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:36,938
Speaker 1: That's the obvious thing, right?

696
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,726
Speaker 1: You can tell that right from the first screen.

697
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:44,610
Speaker 1: the thing That's key that people don't realize is the gravity crushes the pigs as they get pulled into the planets.

698
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,289
Speaker 1: There'll be pigs floating between a planet.

699
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:51,710
Speaker 1: If you just nudge them so they get into the gravity field they'll slam into the planet and die.

700
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,450
Speaker 0: Yep, or i'll like bop a rock into the atmosphere and it'll circle around and kill them all.

701
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,695
Speaker 0: I don't have to hit any birds in there.

702
00:40:56,836 --> 00:41:00,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, or there'll be a meteor outside the gravity field.

703
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,484
Speaker 1: You'll bump the meteor into the gravity or the asteroid into the gravity field.

704
00:41:03,886 --> 00:41:04,950
Speaker 1: then it will accelerate.

705
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:08,862
Speaker 1: Just say accelerate towards the planet not around the planet.

706
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:11,230
Speaker 0: Well, it'll go around in the spiral and then smash everything.

707
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:12,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's also the new ice bird.

708
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:20,610
Speaker 1: anything He touches turns to ice and you think and then of course, obviously that opens things up for the bluebird who's excellent at smashing ice.

709
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:25,150
Speaker 1: So you ice something that's like heavy rocks, then you bring the bluebird in and he smashes it up.

710
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,698
Speaker 1: But there's another thing you can do with the ice thing.

711
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:38,650
Speaker 1: if you ice up some stuff that's under some heavy rocks And it's in a gravity field Now those heavy rocks will crush the ice immediately bringing the whole thing down towards the planet.

712
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:43,430
Speaker 0: He also has much better timing than similar things in the first game where you can skim him off of something.

713
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,961
Speaker 0: It'll ice it a little and you've got some leeway before.

714
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:46,463
Speaker 0: you have to.

715
00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:48,070
Speaker 0: you know, make him go full ice.

716
00:41:48,491 --> 00:41:53,290
Speaker 0: So you can skim one thing have it like skip off leave some ice and then smash into something else into the full.

717
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:54,869
Speaker 1: You can get some extra ice out of him.

718
00:41:55,091 --> 00:42:00,558
Speaker 0: He doesn't just you know ice and kind of like how you in the old game you drop the white bird With your little egg like you drop it.

719
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:02,907
Speaker 1: I'm so glad the white bird is not in this game.

720
00:42:02,947 --> 00:42:03,630
Speaker 1: I love that bird.

721
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,674
Speaker 1: He's my most hated bird.

722
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:06,120
Speaker 0: I hated the fucking boomerang bird.

723
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:07,867
Speaker 1: boomerang bird is also not in this game.

724
00:42:07,907 --> 00:42:08,048
Speaker 1: good.

725
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:09,174
Speaker 1: Thank god Fuck those birds.

726
00:42:09,214 --> 00:42:13,610
Speaker 0: No, but I love the white bird because I draw I want to make Under something and then drop the egg.

727
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,964
Speaker 0: So he'd fly up and hit something and the egg would fly down and hit something.

728
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:19,740
Speaker 1: if I may if I was working for Rovio, you know what I would come out with.

729
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:23,863
Speaker 1: I would come out with not a full game But just a level set and the level set would be angry birds.

730
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:39,370
Speaker 1: black nothing Nothing, but black bird, but to make up for the fact that it'd be too easy with nothing but black bird It's like the pigs have built the biggest fortresses like they're just like six rocks deep and like you got to smash your way in there.

731
00:42:39,732 --> 00:42:44,662
Speaker 1: You know with all black birds, it would be the best I'm waiting for versus angry birds where you've got.

732
00:42:44,722 --> 00:42:48,258
Speaker 0: imagine if you had two planets or two things And this wouldn't be a phone game anymore.

733
00:42:48,278 --> 00:42:51,030
Speaker 0: I guess it could be yeah where i'm shooting birds at you.

734
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,746
Speaker 0: You're shooting birds at me in real time and I got pigs to protect.

735
00:42:54,766 --> 00:42:55,610
Speaker 0: you got pigs to protect.

736
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:57,248
Speaker 1: No, that's not how I would do it.

737
00:42:57,731 --> 00:43:00,079
Speaker 1: What I would do is I would put pigs in the middle right

738
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:01,063
Speaker 0: who kills the most and

739
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:06,572
Speaker 1: I would have simultaneously firing one two three go Right

740
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:09,749
Speaker 0: and you set a trajectory and then you both hit you'd go they go and then

741
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:15,387
Speaker 1: Right, but the question is let's say we both hit something right a tower and the tower collapses on a pig.

742
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:16,450
Speaker 1: who gets the points?

743
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:19,845
Speaker 0: Maybe it's co-op and there's some where you have to time everything right.

744
00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:22,074
Speaker 1: co-op is excellent Excellent idea.

745
00:43:22,094 --> 00:43:23,801
Speaker 0: I think that'll all come if they.

746
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:25,408
Speaker 0: uh, I would invest in them if I could.

747
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,885
Speaker 1: yeah Uh, is there anything else to say about angry birds?

748
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:29,530
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.

749
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:34,630
Speaker 1: So, you know, I was sort of under the assumption when I paid my dollar for it that I was getting the whole game.

750
00:43:35,314 --> 00:43:46,044
Speaker 1: But that was like, you know if you buy angry birds angry bird seasons You pay the dollar you get the whole game and you keep getting updates too like since i've gotten them They keep adding seasons to anger bird seasons and it costs nothing, right?

751
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:53,644
Speaker 1: They just keep adding them all the time Uh, and I suspect they will continue to add them for as long as they exist Which is awesome because they don't have to pay any more money.

752
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:54,730
Speaker 1: anger bird space.

753
00:43:54,850 --> 00:44:00,389
Speaker 1: I paid a dollar and you got level one and you got level two, but then there's another level the danger zone.

754
00:44:01,351 --> 00:44:05,142
Speaker 1: And the danger zone was not for it was not included in that first dollar.

755
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:05,564
Speaker 1: I paid.

756
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:07,690
Speaker 1: I had to pay another dollar.

757
00:44:07,871 --> 00:44:11,150
Speaker 0: Oh my god now it's the cost of that breakfast exactly.

758
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:12,174
Speaker 1: Which is still.

759
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:21,286
Speaker 1: I paid the other dollar, you know, if they would have just said from the beginning anger bird space two dollars I would have paid the two dollars no question and I would not have been angry because I would not.

760
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:22,691
Speaker 0: scott's an angry Scott.

761
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:26,502
Speaker 1: now i'm not angry because it's two dollars or the two dollars wasn't worth it.

762
00:44:26,642 --> 00:44:29,270
Speaker 1: I'm only angry because yeah anger bird, right?

763
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:31,576
Speaker 1: Because I was deceived right?

764
00:44:31,596 --> 00:44:32,339
Speaker 1: They didn't tell me.

765
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,630
Speaker 1: Hey, you're paying a dollar for half of anger bird space.

766
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:41,960
Speaker 1: They said you're paying a dollar for angry bird space and then later they're like, oh just kidding You didn't actually pay a dollar for anger bird space.

767
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:43,930
Speaker 1: You paid a dollar for half of anger bird space.

768
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:52,347
Speaker 1: That's like if I went to the car dealership and they said here this car is a thousand dollars I say okay Here's a thousand dollars and then I go to pick up the car and the wheels are missing again.

769
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:52,950
Speaker 1: minus the wheel.

770
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:56,137
Speaker 0: That's exactly what they do Except instead of having things missing.

771
00:44:56,237 --> 00:45:01,337
Speaker 1: if they would have said minus the wheels and the whole car actually cost fifteen hundred I would not have complained.

772
00:45:01,357 --> 00:45:04,170
Speaker 0: They'll put extra stuff on there and be like, oh, yeah, you gotta pay for this, too.

773
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,453
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's bullshit.

774
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:11,390
Speaker 1: Just freaking tell me that, you know, just tell me that danger zone is not included from the get-go.

775
00:45:11,893 --> 00:45:15,070
Speaker 1: You know say one dollar angry bird space minus danger zone.

776
00:45:15,251 --> 00:45:18,448
Speaker 0: So at least it's not false advertising anyway, but it's not much else to say.

777
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:22,390
Speaker 0: fun game It's worth the dollar or the free and we're gonna be packs.

778
