1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,709
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, July 21st, 2022.

2
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:09,910
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:13,476
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,928
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:16,417
Speaker 0: Tonight we are talking about zoos.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,298
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:26,560
Speaker 0: So, uh, something that I didn't quite, like, obviously, logically, this was gonna happen someday.

8
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:31,720
Speaker 0: But I never actually, like, really thought about when it would happen.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,080
Speaker 0: Like, it was something that just did not cross my mind that it even would ever actually happen.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:46,399
Speaker 0: I did not actively plan for it, but, uh, right before, you know, we took a week off because a bunch of us went to a private beach house in Wildwood to, uh, beach and somehow not get sunburned.

11
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:52,460
Speaker 0: But, uh, right before that, I, uh, I shaved like you do.

12
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:55,739
Speaker 0: And then I thought, you know what?

13
00:00:56,501 --> 00:01:05,700
Speaker 0: I should put it, get a new blade out and, like, replace it and bring it to the shore with me because I would like to stay somewhat shaven at the beach so I don't get too hot.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:20,421
Speaker 0: And then I go and I realize the blade I had just discarded was the last of the gigantic fucking box of blades that I bought when we first moved to New York City in 2009.

15
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:21,667
Speaker 1: I mean, I have a giant symbol.

16
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:24,100
Speaker 1: You're using them at my- you're probably changing them too often.

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,760
Speaker 1: How many times do you use one blade?

18
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:29,444
Speaker 0: Uh, 15 to 20?

19
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:32,000
Speaker 1: Oh, that's actually way too many times to use one blade.

20
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:33,017
Speaker 1: Ah, well, well.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,340
Speaker 1: You're supposed to use them, like, six to ten times.

22
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,099
Speaker 1: That is true.

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:47,220
Speaker 0: However, my shaving patterns have changed a lot over the years because I kept growing a beard and, uh, for a while now- I was about to shame you for being uneconomical, but you're being overly economical.

24
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:50,320
Speaker 1: Or you're lying, which is not, you know, out of the realm.

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:58,440
Speaker 0: Thing is, I went through blades faster when I would shave my whole face and when I didn't use clippers and I've done all sorts of different stuff.

26
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:05,600
Speaker 0: But, uh, for a while now, since I did the beard, I pretty much only have to shave, like, one part of my neck and not even that often.

27
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, how many blades were in your mega pack of blades?

28
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,413
Speaker 0: Uh, a thousand?

29
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,280
Speaker 0: Two thousand?

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,222
Speaker 1: A thousand?

31
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:13,744
Speaker 1: What?

32
00:02:13,764 --> 00:02:18,060
Speaker 1: No, the math doesn't work out for 15 shaves, a thousand blades.

33
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:31,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is, I tried to find- That would be 15- even if you shaved every day, if you use one blade 15 times and you have a thousand, that would be 15,000 days, uh, in years, which would be 41 years.

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,040
Speaker 1: So, no, you either weren't shaving- you didn't have a thousand blades or you didn't use each one 15 times.

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,180
Speaker 1: Yeah,

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:55,580
Speaker 0: well, the tricky part was, right before the show, I went to my Amazon to find, like, the thing I'd actually ordered and the receipt in my email just says, like, "Bulk Package Feather Blades" and if I click on the link to it, it takes me to an Amazon, uh, not available.

37
00:02:56,107 --> 00:03:06,399
Speaker 0: So, I had to buy- Well, I have- I have a package of a hundred blades and it cost me, like, nine dollars and I bought it in- I definitely got way bigger than that, so let me see what I just bought.

38
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,556
Speaker 1: I bought it four years ago and I've only used, like, maybe three or four of the packages.

39
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:22,960
Speaker 1: that are five blades each, so I've used maybe a quarter at most, about, of the- of the hundred blades, I'd say.

40
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:33,980
Speaker 0: Yep, so this time, I bought- I'm pretty sure I bought the same thing you were talking about because what I bought now was a pack of one hundred Feather Double Aged Blades- Double Aged Blades and it's, like, one-

41
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,799
Speaker 1: And they're all- they're little packs of five and they're all- they're all crammed into it,

42
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:37,940
Speaker 0: yeah.

43
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,383
Speaker 0: It's, like, one skinny little thing.

44
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:45,900
Speaker 0: It's clearly the kind of thing that you would, like, buy and put in, like, by the cash register of your drugstore and sell.

45
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,179
Speaker 1: Yes, that is what it is.

46
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,500
Speaker 0: That is what I have bought now.

47
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,358
Speaker 1: I have the same thing.

48
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:50,819
Speaker 1: So- Only different brand.

49
00:03:51,601 --> 00:04:00,239
Speaker 0: So, uh, now I realize that the other thing I need to replace is I have this little plastic bin that, whenever I use up a blade, I, uh- Actually, if I- I have one of those, too.

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,900
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna do this because I think it would be dangerous.

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,680
Speaker 0: Uh, it's pretty big, but if I open it, I could theoretically count how many blades are in that fucking thing.

52
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:10,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can guarantee you it's not a thousand.

53
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:12,539
Speaker 0: I can guarantee I would cut myself.

54
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:14,128
Speaker 1: Yes.

55
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:22,039
Speaker 1: It is not- An actual pile of razor blades.

56
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,340
Speaker 0: A literal pile of actual used razor blades.

57
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,196
Speaker 1: Name that Pokemon.

58
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:30,420
Speaker 1: A pile of razor blades.

59
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,580
Speaker 0: I don't think I can fit many more blades in that thing, either, so I bought a new one of those, too.

60
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,340
Speaker 1: Mine's getting close to, you know.

61
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,659
Speaker 0: It is, like, I had to shove the most recent blade in, and it barely went in.

62
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:42,719
Speaker 0: If you shake it, it's just, like, a lump.

63
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:55,082
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, I remember way back when we started shaving the right way, we did an episode on it on December 15th, 2005.

64
00:04:55,082 --> 00:05:00,620
Speaker 0: And I don't even know how much money I've saved over the years by not using, like, cartridge razors since we made that call.

65
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:03,187
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,060
Speaker 0: So, yeah, in the news, uh, I don't know, the planet is burning.

67
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:26,280
Speaker 0: I don't know how much more urgency people who know this is happening can express upon the world, but climate change is rapidly reaching tipping points of extreme consequences, even in industrialized, previously falsely safe places, like London.

68
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,600
Speaker 0: This heatwave is one of the worst heatwaves in modern history in some places, and it's only getting worse.

69
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:47,040
Speaker 0: I think I saw there were so many fires in London caused just by the high heat, because it's literally never been this hot before, that the city is low-key shutting down, like, trains aren't running, data centers are failing, it's kind of ridiculous.

70
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,346
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, the thing still stands.

71
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:55,620
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, people now can no longer deny that climate action must be taken, right?

72
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:03,200
Speaker 1: But nobody, even leftist people who want to, you know, like, do environmental stuff, right?

73
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:16,320
Speaker 1: People are still not willing, and the only way you're going to escape is if massive numbers of people actually drastically change their overall lifestyle.

74
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,620
Speaker 0: Which requires state action.

75
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,120
Speaker 1: If you live, right, you're going to have to change things about the life you live, right?

76
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,397
Speaker 1: You're going to have to maybe live somewhere else, not use cars, not, you know, live without air conditioning.

77
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,039
Speaker 1: You're going to have to do all these things.

78
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,805
Speaker 0: Well, actually, the opposite is going to happen.

79
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:39,880
Speaker 0: Air conditioning will literally be necessary to live in a large percentage of the habitable parts of the earth.

80
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,859
Speaker 1: People might have to, you know, move out of parts of the world that are not habitable.

81
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:45,644
Speaker 0: There aren't places.

82
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:52,060
Speaker 0: The air conditioning is already necessary for life in many areas that are not able to be depopulated.

83
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,951
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, no one lives in the Sahara.

84
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:57,000
Speaker 1: I mean, very few people live in the Sahara desert.

85
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:05,700
Speaker 0: But even worse, this could actually be rapidly mitigated, mostly by regulating industries.

86
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,561
Speaker 1: Yeah.

87
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:16,539
Speaker 1: That's part of the drastic change in life is that we're going to have to shut down certain industries and be like, "Sorry, this entire industry is ruining the

88
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:16,859
Speaker 1: world.".

89
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:23,120
Speaker 1: And, you know, the net benefits are not positive considering the damage you're doing.

90
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,960
Speaker 1: And therefore, everyone's going to have to do without whatever that industry produces and find another way to live.

91
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,025
Speaker 1: And you know what?

92
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:31,420
Speaker 1: You know, that's the solution.

93
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:35,400
Speaker 1: At least because we've waited so long, that's the solution, right?

94
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,264
Speaker 1: But even then... Nobody's going to do that.

95
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:39,773
Speaker 1: It's not going to happen.

96
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:41,040
Speaker 1: People won't change their lifestyles.

97
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:54,040
Speaker 0: The US government, which has some of the most control over this of any nation on earth, in effect, also failed to take even basic action because, once again, in our Senate, one jackass voted against it and filibustered the whole thing.

98
00:07:55,601 --> 00:08:06,280
Speaker 1: Even if the US was run by me and I banned cars, how much would that delay the global climate change?

99
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,659
Speaker 1: Even if I had done it 10 years ago, 15 years ago, it's like all the other countries are still doing what they're going to do.

100
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time...

101
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,151
Speaker 1: You would need a Scott to run all the big countries, right?

102
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:23,638
Speaker 1: China, Russia, Europe, European Union, India...

103
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is, up until now, a lot of the interventions wouldn't have been that drastic and could have been done within the existing political framework.

104
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,239
Speaker 0: And we even have buy-in from a lot of the countries that contribute to this.

105
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:40,419
Speaker 0: But, of course, for a lot of reasons, humans waited and waited and waited way too long.

106
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:49,718
Speaker 0: And now we're in this almost worse situation where people have gone from "it's not happening" to "it's happening and there's literally nothing we can ever do, so fuck

107
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:50,139
Speaker 0: everything.".

108
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,520
Speaker 0: Like, the doomers and the nihilists are replacing the activists.

109
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:04,380
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know what to do about it because we have no influence over our non-democratic government here in the US.

110
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,000
Speaker 1: I have even less influence over other countries' governments.

111
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:11,720
Speaker 1: There's no world government.

112
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,520
Speaker 0: I don't know, I feel like it's going to take climate riots and mass displacements?

113
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,880
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, there'll be riots, but even if the riots succeed in, say, overthrowing a government, right?

114
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:31,332
Speaker 1: And it's like, congrats, you're in charge now, but the problem is unfixable now.

115
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:47,579
Speaker 0: There's that Kyrgyzets video that shows a lot of statistics that if you just reduce the red meat industry to 10% of what it is today, that would actually get us most of the way toward the targets needed to start reversing this.

116
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:49,348
Speaker 1: Ban it.

117
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably should.

118
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,040
Speaker 1: That's what I'm talking about, a real lifestyle change.

119
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,980
Speaker 1: Like, you know, there is no McDonald's or McDonald's doesn't have beef at all, right?

120
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:07,500
Speaker 1: Or, you know, it's like, you know, significant changes to the way we go about life or what is required.

121
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,440
Speaker 1: Like, things that you will notice and will impact you in a way that will make most people unhappy, right?

122
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:15,820
Speaker 1: But this is the choice now, right?

123
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,460
Speaker 1: Is it unhappiness A or unhappiness B, right?

124
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:24,740
Speaker 1: It's like, would you rather never have no cars allowed and no beef ever, right?

125
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,359
Speaker 1: It's just gone.

126
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:26,700
Speaker 1: It's not a product anymore.

127
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:27,677
Speaker 1: You can't buy it.

128
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,173
Speaker 1: Yeah.

129
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,700
Speaker 1: There's no cow farms, ranchers out of business, sorry.

130
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,320
Speaker 1: McDonald's, burger joints, all out of business or open or serve something else, right?

131
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:44,595
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, big economic devastation for them and/or all those things.

132
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:46,379
Speaker 1: stay open, but it's 110 degrees out.

133
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:57,660
Speaker 0: I think what's really interesting to me is how few people, like, actually realized what this was going to look like.

134
00:10:58,003 --> 00:10:59,680
Speaker 0: A lot of people just seem to think it would get hotter.

135
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:01,439
Speaker 1: Al Gore did with his scary video.

136
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,020
Speaker 0: They seem to not realize that it's not just it gets hotter.

137
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,880
Speaker 0: It's that the climate and weather get radically less stable and predictable.

138
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:18,160
Speaker 0: Like today, in New York City, a storm that was not in any way predicted suddenly appeared.

139
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,866
Speaker 0: We had 1.5-inch hail.

140
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,520
Speaker 0: That is hail the size of a ping-pong ball.

141
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:24,119
Speaker 1: I didn't see any of the hail.

142
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:25,480
Speaker 0: I didn't see that.

143
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,199
Speaker 1: I heard reports of the hail, but I didn't see any out the window.

144
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:28,773
Speaker 0: That was reported on the news.

145
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:29,580
Speaker 1: I wonder if we got some pictures of it.

146
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,800
Speaker 1: There was a heavy rain, though.

147
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:36,200
Speaker 0: There was also 60-mile-an-hour wind gusts, and it rolled through in the span of 20 minutes and it was gone.

148
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, New York still seems to have a winter.

149
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,700
Speaker 1: It snowed at least a little bit, right?

150
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:44,400
Speaker 1: There was some snowing going on at least once.

151
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,819
Speaker 0: Well, in fact, we've had more extreme winters, too.

152
00:11:47,302 --> 00:11:50,300
Speaker 0: There was more snowfall at some of the ski mountains than there is historically.

153
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,600
Speaker 1: Well, you know, but it's not the winter's short.

154
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,960
Speaker 1: It's not as, you know, I haven't seen one of the mega winters in a while.

155
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:58,479
Speaker 0: What I have seen is our summer is getting split.

156
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,538
Speaker 1: Not in, like, a decade or so.

157
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:02,160
Speaker 0: What we really don't have anymore in New York City is the spring.

158
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,200
Speaker 0: We sort of have, like, spring turns into, like, the rainy summer.

159
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,860
Speaker 0: Like, we have, like, a monsoon summer and then a dry summer.

160
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,099
Speaker 0: Like, we have different, like, eras of summer now.

161
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,360
Speaker 1: Regardless, right, the summer that we have now is a lot like Tropical Island or Florida.

162
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:18,748
Speaker 0: Yeah.

163
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,676
Speaker 1: Which I'm not complaining about because I like that, but it's bad.

164
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,360
Speaker 0: Well, I'm complaining about it in one sense.

165
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:33,639
Speaker 0: I mean, I enjoy the heat, but also because I cannot change that temperature, I can still enjoy that temperature while I'm in it before it eventually kills me.

166
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:37,280
Speaker 0: So, yeah, that's heartening.

167
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,560
Speaker 0: In exactly opposite sentiment news, there is this story, and you've got to read all the details.

168
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,999
Speaker 0: I'll link to the Times of India, but there's an NPR article, there's a Twitter thread, there's even a video about it.

169
00:12:49,420 --> 00:13:06,938
Speaker 0: But best I can tell, there was a group of people in a village in India who basically put on their own online fake stream of the Indian Premier League, which is one of those cricket leagues.

170
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:18,160
Speaker 0: They ran this, like, not even at the same time as the real one, and they ran an illegal betting operation via Telegram where people overseas could illegally bet on IPL.

171
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:24,120
Speaker 0: But the double twist was the people were illegally betting on an illegal fake IPL.

172
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,060
Speaker 0: So not only were they betting illegally, but they were not betting on the actual sport.

173
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:39,700
Speaker 0: They were betting on a bunch of villagers making a fake live stream and rigging what was happening in the game while they were taking votes in real time.

174
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:50,469
Speaker 1: So imagine if I went to the public park where there's a baseball field, and I got 18 friends together, and we all dressed up as the Mets and the Yankees.

175
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:53,980
Speaker 1: We went and bought jerseys and uniforms and equipment and everything.

176
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,080
Speaker 0: And we got a camera with a close-in angle, so you see the players, but you don't see anything else.

177
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,360
Speaker 1: Right, we got a bunch of cameras, and we had a broadcaster doing broadcasting, and we had some graphics.

178
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:24,089
Speaker 1: And we pretended, so that if you looked at the camera, and you never see the stands, because there are no stands, and you just only see the field, and we zoom in to people's faces a lot, and it's like if the people watching didn't actually know anything about baseball, other than that there is a baseball, there is a Mets and a Yankees, right?

179
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:28,960
Speaker 1: It could be convincing, especially with I'm capable of 4K live streaming.

180
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:36,820
Speaker 1: We could convince somebody who doesn't know anything about baseball that they are watching a real Mets-Yankees game.

181
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:42,270
Speaker 1: It's possible to do that with technology that's available off the shelf.

182
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:48,384
Speaker 1: So if the other people don't know better, and the other people are gamblers, yes, it is entirely feasible.

183
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:55,920
Speaker 1: You could convince them to bet on a game, but that game is just you and your friends pretending to reenact.

184
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,987
Speaker 1: Basically, they're betting on a reenactment, right?

185
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:04,780
Speaker 1: And then we can enact whatever we like in order to make them lose their bets and take their money.

186
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:16,160
Speaker 0: So this is all just amazing, and of course this is only in the news because apparently they got caught, but my hat is off to that amazing con.

187
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,732
Speaker 0: That is very much the kind of thing I want to do in Blades in the Dark in our next section.

188
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:23,360
Speaker 0: Rig the Ghost Races.

189
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,143
Speaker 1: You know, I wonder, right?

190
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:30,680
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, there's plenty of people doing war reenactments, medieval historical reenactments.

191
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,040
Speaker 0: Ooh, like reenact the 1947 World Series or something?

192
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,966
Speaker 1: Right, it's like, are there sports reenactors?

193
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:38,449
Speaker 1: There must be, right?

194
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:43,660
Speaker 1: I've never seen one, but there must be sports reenactors out there somewhere.

195
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:50,980
Speaker 0: Like, play the game semi for real, but make sure the box score matches the historical box score and any notable incidents still happen.

196
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:53,663
Speaker 1: I think, you know, yes and no, right?

197
00:15:53,683 --> 00:16:01,355
Speaker 1: But I think part of the problem is that, you know, a sports reenactment at some point requires feats of strength, right?

198
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,360
Speaker 1: That the reenactors may not be capable of.

199
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:13,240
Speaker 0: There probably aren't enough, like, to be a Civil War reenactor, you need to have a costume and be able to walk forward slowly.

200
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,231
Speaker 1: Let's reenact the first time a figure skater did a triple axel at the Olympics.

201
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:20,915
Speaker 1: Okay, who here can do a triple axel?

202
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:21,296
Speaker 1: Anybody?

203
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:21,897
Speaker 1: Anybody?

204
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:23,000
Speaker 1: It's like, nobody.

205
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:30,500
Speaker 0: How many Harlem Globetrotters can you find for a sport to be able to, like, miss a critical bad-bad?

206
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,210
Speaker 0: Like, get struck out at a critical moment with a special kind of curveball?

207
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,677
Speaker 0: that was, like, part of the story of that year?

208
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:37,860
Speaker 0: Like, you're not gonna pull that off.

209
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,549
Speaker 1: Let's reenact the time that Shaq dunked over.

210
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,155
Speaker 1: It's like, any Shaqs?

211
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:44,760
Speaker 1: We got any Shaqs to spare?

212
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,203
Speaker 0: Board game reenactment.

213
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:54,380
Speaker 0: Let's play T&E, but we'll play it so that Scott wins because it was the famous game that Scott won in Odd 8.

214
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,004
Speaker 1: Let's just reenact that game over and over.

215
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:59,012
Speaker 1: We need to play a real T&E.

216
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:01,298
Speaker 1: Let's just reenact that one.

217
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:02,100
Speaker 1: We can't beat that one.

218
00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:05,473
Speaker 1: We'll never play a better game of T&E than that.

219
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:06,439
Speaker 1: Let's just do that one again.

220
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:10,238
Speaker 1: E-Sports reenactment.

221
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:19,109
Speaker 0: You know, it's interesting because with E-Sports, people just watch the replays, and I remember a friend of ours- Same thing with regular sports.

222
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,059
Speaker 1: You can watch replays.

223
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:33,759
Speaker 0: Well, I remember a friend of ours years ago got a DVD box set that was basically an entire season of their particular baseball team, and they were just watching that season, like, from beginning to end over the course of a month.

224
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:44,320
Speaker 0: Which, I guess, if I was way deeper into hockey, I could see rewatching a particularly good Stanley Cup playoff series.

225
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:52,480
Speaker 0: So, I don't think we need reenactments since we record sports directly in a way that we've never recorded before.

226
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,480
Speaker 1: I think you would be reenacting sports that happened prior to recording.

227
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:55,921
Speaker 0: True.

228
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,873
Speaker 0: Of course, at that point, is it reenactment, or do you just make a movie?

229
00:17:59,993 --> 00:18:02,160
Speaker 0: Like, hire actors and just film it like a movie?

230
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:04,168
Speaker 1: No, that's what reenactment is.

231
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,140
Speaker 1: Civil War reenactors don't have video of the battle.

232
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:07,860
Speaker 0: Yup.

233
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:19,280
Speaker 0: No, but I'm saying, the way you would do a sports reenactment is do it like you would make a- like, if you're doing a- reenacting a baseball game, you do a baseball movie, and you just make it the way Hollywood would make a movie about baseball.

234
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,940
Speaker 0: They don't have that many professional baseballers playing a full game, they just fake it all.

235
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,341
Speaker 1: Anyway.

236
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:27,701
Speaker 1: The other

237
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:40,680
Speaker 0: way I see most people reenacting that we can get into the rest of the show is they'll take more modern sports games and set up the players the right way and just let it play the old game and see how closely it matches up to the real game.

238
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,119
Speaker 0: And that's actually really popular.

239
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,586
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

240
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:53,651
Speaker 0: So, I don't really mountain bike anymore.

241
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:55,576
Speaker 0: COVID wasn't the only thing that got in my way.

242
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:57,200
Speaker 0: Being 40 got in my way too.

243
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,883
Speaker 0: But I do still really like mountain biking.

244
00:19:00,544 --> 00:19:04,089
Speaker 0: And there's a race that looks so fun.

245
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,176
Speaker 0: I, on one hand, I would like to be in this race at least once.

246
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:13,040
Speaker 0: This is moderately within my abilities.

247
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:26,740
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, the time frame I have left where something even close to this is even remotely safe, considering that I'm already 40, is narrowing rapidly to the point that there is no chance I will ever do this.

248
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,204
Speaker 0: But it is called the Mega Avalanche.

249
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:39,060
Speaker 0: And it is an all-start race, or a mass start race, meaning like a thousand people all start from a starting line simultaneously.

250
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,440
Speaker 1: That's dangerous.

251
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,945
Speaker 0: It takes like 40 minutes to get to the bottom.

252
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,372
Speaker 0: It is a race in the Alps at a ski resort on mountain bikes.

253
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:50,100
Speaker 0: You start at the top in snow and then by the bottom you're in dirt.

254
00:19:50,881 --> 00:20:01,054
Speaker 0: And this video, my thing of the day, is someone winning this thing with full commentary, start to finish, 43 minutes 37 seconds.

255
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,378
Speaker 0: This is amazing to watch.

256
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:05,980
Speaker 0: It's just really chill and fun.

257
00:20:08,003 --> 00:20:10,100
Speaker 1: After you get away from the thousand people.

258
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:11,362
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, absolutely.

259
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:22,278
Speaker 0: And it looks like the first bit of the race requires a lot of stamina and like, it's difficult not in a mountain biking way, but more in just a, can you run up this hill with your bike?

260
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,920
Speaker 0: Can you actually bike on snow?

261
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,880
Speaker 0: And that seems to spread everyone out real, real far before they hit the single track parts.

262
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:32,704
Speaker 0: This just looks so- How do you even know which way to go?

263
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:36,155
Speaker 1: Is it like, can't you just go, the goal is to just get to the bottom.

264
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,600
Speaker 1: however you can get down there?

265
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,904
Speaker 0: It looks like there's markers.

266
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:43,680
Speaker 0: I think people practice the run, like they know the route, there's other people, like I don't know all the details.

267
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:53,020
Speaker 1: There must be a way to get to the top without, you know, walking because 40 minutes downhill is- Well yeah, you realize the way- Is there a cable car or something?

268
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,533
Speaker 0: So when I would mountain bike, what you do is, it's ski resorts and you just bring your mountain bike on the ski lift.

269
00:20:57,573 --> 00:20:59,599
Speaker 0: They usually have special things you can attach your bikes to.

270
00:21:00,363 --> 00:21:00,640
Speaker 1: Okay.

271
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,607
Speaker 1: And still a really tall ski lift.

272
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:04,740
Speaker 1: There gotta be a cable car instead.

273
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:08,599
Speaker 0: I mean, well this one would probably be a gondola, but even small mountains often have little gondolas, so.

274
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:09,798
Speaker 1: Anyway.

275
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:19,900
Speaker 0: Anyway, I would love to do this, especially because the course, but for the aspect of racing, and but for the aspect of there's a thousand other people like doing it.

276
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:27,660
Speaker 0: The course itself, this is not like that dangerous if you don't do anything stupid and don't try to go crazy fast and win the race.

277
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:32,512
Speaker 0: Just biking down this on a modern mountain bike for fun would actually be pretty safe.

278
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,540
Speaker 0: And I can't actually find references of anyone ever dying in this race.

279
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:42,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you go, if you're not trying to go fast and there's not a lot of people that might run into you or that you'll run into.

280
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,650
Speaker 1: And you have a very modern bike, you know, that has like lots of- Not a single, you definitely don't want a hardtail.

281
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,320
Speaker 0: You don't want to do this on a full suspension bike.

282
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:57,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like and you know, it's like yeah, you could you could just sort of go- But long segments of it are- And you got decent, you know, quality brakes.

283
00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,100
Speaker 1: It's like you'll make it to the bottom.

284
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,717
Speaker 0: Yep, long segments of this are like- Gas might hurt.

285
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,420
Speaker 0: Are very much the easy, like I would consider them, I would actually say they're an easy mountain biking trail.

286
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:11,240
Speaker 0: They're only hard because these people are trying to do them as fast as possible.

287
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:12,380
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

288
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,840
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

289
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:16,559
Speaker 1: Uh, what did I have?

290
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:19,620
Speaker 0: How have you forgotten?

291
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:21,405
Speaker 1: All right, I remember now.

292
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:26,960
Speaker 1: So Wikipedia is a website that we use every damn day for all kinds of shit, right?

293
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,264
Speaker 1: You know, it needs no explanation.

294
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:35,740
Speaker 1: And it's also well known that there are a lot of people who try to vandalize Wikipedia, right?

295
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:40,000
Speaker 1: Some of them are just vandals, you know, the same reason people vandalize everything.

296
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,307
Speaker 1: Yep.

297
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:57,360
Speaker 1: But you know, because Wikipedia is treated by many people as like a, you know, a trusted source of information, if you can successfully put false information on Wikipedia, then you can convince a lot of people that something is true if they don't bother to check the sources or anything, right?

298
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,840
Speaker 1: And you can make fake sources and, right?

299
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,520
Speaker 1: So there are, and there are a lot of people out there who have very, you know, there's how many billions of people?

300
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,740
Speaker 1: There's people out there who have really specific agendas for something.

301
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:24,700
Speaker 1: And for whatever reason, those, some of those people attempt to vandalize Wikipedia in a specific way, especially on the non-English Wikipedias, which have a lot smaller communities maintaining and defending them.

302
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:37,980
Speaker 1: So, on Wikipedia, there is a page called Long Term Abuse, and it is a record of basically all the people who are not just Wikipedia vandals.

303
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,820
Speaker 1: That would be a list, you know, ridiculously long.

304
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,180
Speaker 1: These are people who are, they stick with it, right?

305
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,300
Speaker 1: They keep on trying to vandalize Wikipedia in a specific way for a specific reason.

306
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:53,740
Speaker 1: And they keep doing it like they have not given up.

307
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,439
Speaker 1: They keep evading bans, getting new IP addresses, like they are tryharding.

308
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,820
Speaker 1: They're trying so hard that Wikipedia gave these people their own page.

309
00:24:06,322 --> 00:24:12,720
Speaker 1: And some of the stories of these people are so specific and hilarious, right?

310
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:17,057
Speaker 1: You know, right at the top, there's what the Bambi one, right?

311
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:27,540
Speaker 1: Bambi Fan 101 focuses on Disney articles, claims to be a young boy in the Southern US with a professed love of juvenile-themed movies.

312
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,835
Speaker 1: So there's someone out there who is like, they just want to vent, they want to control the Disney message on Wikipedia.

313
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:45,900
Speaker 0: Billy North adds fictitious individual Clutch Con to associated acts or former member fields of infoboxes for alternative rock and blues artists.

314
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:50,619
Speaker 0: He just goes to small-time bands and adds this fake name to them, and that's it.

315
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:57,280
Speaker 1: But it's not just that they do that, that's funny, but they keep doing it.

316
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:04,260
Speaker 1: They get banned, they go to try to get new IP addresses and new accounts and do whatever to keep doing it.

317
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:06,124
Speaker 1: They've not given up.

318
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:13,589
Speaker 1: Any chance they get, they go to a hotel, they got Wi-Fi at a hotel, they got a different IP address, they make a sock puppet, and they get to it.

319
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:15,597
Speaker 1: They're like, "All right, it's Clutch Con time, let's

320
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:15,677
Speaker 1: go."

321
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:16,761
Speaker 1: Right?

322
00:25:17,042 --> 00:25:24,280
Speaker 1: They get banned, they go to their friend's house, they go at it again, and they've been doing this over a long period.

323
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,601
Speaker 1: It's like,

324
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:25,042
Speaker 1: "Really?"

325
00:25:26,427 --> 00:25:27,410
Speaker 1: They just don't give up.

326
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:30,260
Speaker 1: And that's what makes it notable.

327
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:33,868
Speaker 0: It's interesting that this would be someone's hobby.

328
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:48,100
Speaker 0: It's funny because I expected, scrolling down this list when you first called my attention to this page, it would mostly be people who have a very specific political agenda, like they're doing it for some purpose, but a lot of these just seem completely nonsensical.

329
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:52,991
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, "Motorsports and Japan LTA," right?

330
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:56,380
Speaker 1: Pro-Japanese, anti-Korean edits, that's not surprising.

331
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:05,480
Speaker 1: A lot of the edits are people with nationalist or racist ideas or whatever, trying to promote one side over the other.

332
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,587
Speaker 1: But, they only do it in the topic area of motorsports.

333
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:16,460
Speaker 1: They're also guilty of edit warring and disparaging others' knowledge of the English language.

334
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:18,820
Speaker 1: All right.

335
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,540
Speaker 0: Yep, it is actually kind of amazing that Wikipedia is as relatively stable and reliable as it is.

336
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,040
Speaker 0: I long ago stopped interacting with the editor community, I just don't have time for that anymore.

337
00:26:31,642 --> 00:26:44,360
Speaker 0: It has come a long way, but now the body of documentation on how Wikipedia gets managed by the people who dedicate themselves to doing this has far outstripped the time I have left in my life to read words, to read it all.

338
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:52,719
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is Binti.

339
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:56,593
Speaker 0: It's a really, really short book.

340
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:57,560
Speaker 1: We're gonna read it.

341
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,959
Speaker 1: Someone told me that it was very, very short, and I'm like, "Well, Brim, did you know that when you selected

342
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:04,019
Speaker 1: it?".

343
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:06,640
Speaker 0: I did, because it's part of a trilogy, and I'm gonna read all three.

344
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:10,560
Speaker 1: Is all three the book club selection?

345
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,508
Speaker 0: No, we'll just read the first one.

346
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:12,739
Speaker 0: I think we'll have enough to say about it.

347
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:14,920
Speaker 1: You just want a really short book club book?

348
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:20,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it'll be a good palate cleanser, a little bit of an appetizer.

349
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,930
Speaker 0: Also, it won a bunch of awards.

350
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:25,400
Speaker 0: The Hugo at the Nebula for Best Novella.

351
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,939
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying, when something's real short, it's sort of like, "Alright, is it even a

352
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,100
Speaker 1: novel?".

353
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,080
Speaker 1: I feel like to be a book club book, it should be a novel, not a novella.

354
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:38,179
Speaker 0: Oh, so you're saying, "Alright, so for the next book club book, I will pick something that is definitely a long

355
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:38,380
Speaker 0: novel.".

356
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,120
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to be a long novel, it just has to be a novel.

357
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,920
Speaker 0: It could be around counts, and an island, like Monte Cristo or something.

358
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,172
Speaker 1: Novels have a very wide range.

359
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:50,940
Speaker 0: Should I pick another epic?

360
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:57,840
Speaker 1: I think that we do have a word for novella, and a word for novel, right?

361
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:04,880
Speaker 1: We should maybe have a word for big novel that we can use to separate those out of the... right?

362
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:13,280
Speaker 0: But this thing is about space college, which is a topic that is near and dear to geek nights.

363
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:19,660
Speaker 0: We love the shit out of a They Were Eleven style, there's some fancy university in space, galactic whatever.

364
00:28:20,141 --> 00:28:32,340
Speaker 0: So, I figured we should read this, and if you do still think this was too short, and you have complaints about that, I will restore the median length of books in my next book club pick, is all I'm saying.

365
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:38,299
Speaker 1: I think that Genji already restored the median length.

366
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:54,800
Speaker 0: In some other news, I will be live on Sunday at PAX West 2022, without Scott, with a... I'm rewriting a talk I gave a long time ago by myself at PAX Australia.

367
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:58,560
Speaker 0: I have a lot more to say, and I got a whole different thing.

368
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:05,079
Speaker 0: The panel on Sunday, September 4th, 1230pm, in the Sasquatch Theatre, will be losing.

369
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:07,820
Speaker 0: Okay.

370
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:08,980
Speaker 0: Gotta talk about losing.

371
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,240
Speaker 1: The website is moving along, you know, on the one hand, my new job is only four days a week.

372
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,000
Speaker 1: Like, it's Thursday, I'm not working tomorrow.

373
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:17,688
Speaker 1: Alright.

374
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:19,738
Speaker 1: That's just how it is, you know.

375
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:26,819
Speaker 1: I'm going to the beach, but, yeah, I'm going to the beach, so can't really work on the website at the beach, so...

376
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,977
Speaker 0: I mean, beach is a fair excuse for not doing pretty much anything, so...

377
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,599
Speaker 1: You know, also the other thing is when you work four days a week, right, it's like I actually have work to do.

378
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:38,580
Speaker 1: It's a new job, first of all.

379
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,359
Speaker 1: You'd hope they wouldn't hire me with nothing for me to do.

380
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:48,520
Speaker 1: But, yeah, I'm actually filling all the work hours with work, you know, moving right along with that, you know.

381
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:05,456
Speaker 1: It's like, I guess, you know, usually I don't care too much about keeping or impressing my employer or anything, but I don't want to lose the four day a week job or have them believe that, ah, he's not very productive with the four days, he's got to go do five days, you want more, you need 20% more work.

382
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:13,780
Speaker 0: Plus, I will definitely say that any time I've started a new job, like when I got my first project, the novelty alone actually gets me to work way harder.

383
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,267
Speaker 1: No.

384
00:30:16,242 --> 00:30:16,442
Speaker 1: I

385
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:32,339
Speaker 0: mean, at least my job, every job I've taken has had radical shifts in the amount of novelty or the type of work that I do to the point that at least the first month is always like a really exciting rollercoaster, and then I get bored and jaded like I always do.

386
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:43,440
Speaker 1: Regardless, you know, I made a bunch of progress in my time off between the jobs, but, you know, I didn't get over the finish line.

387
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:45,658
Speaker 1: We'll get there, you know.

388
00:30:46,865 --> 00:30:47,858
Speaker 0: I'm pretty excited about it.

389
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,036
Speaker 1: Anyway, it'll happen eventually, you know, who knows, next year, right?

390
00:30:52,478 --> 00:30:52,840
Speaker 1: Whatever.

391
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:54,598
Speaker 1: Who knows?

392
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:58,840
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah, that's all the real meta that's going on over here.

393
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:06,780
Speaker 0: Alright, so, we got actually a decent amount of Thursday ideas of weird topics we've never covered somehow or all these years.

394
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:12,800
Speaker 0: We always have our backup plan of pick a food item, but we're rapidly running out of food items we can talk about.

395
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:28,900
Speaker 0: But somehow, we have talked about amusement parks, but we haven't talked about other kinds of parks, so we're going to today talk about zoos or zoological gardens or animal parks or menageries.

396
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:37,500
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean, you know, I think the first thing that comes to most people's minds when you talk about a zoo, right, is the animal welfare aspect.

397
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:57,220
Speaker 0: There is a wide range of animal welfare statuses of zoos ranging from actually doing for real impressive conservation work with animals all the way down to this place should be shut down and everyone involved in it should be in jail and the animals probably have to be euthanized.

398
00:31:57,841 --> 00:32:14,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, historically speaking, I feel like, you know, basically all zoos, not even a century ago, right, you know, like 20th century, like there was a time, you know, maybe, you know, even within my life, I've seen some places that should be shut down, right?

399
00:32:15,781 --> 00:32:22,618
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, mid or, you know, mid 20th century, I guess like within our lifetimes is when basically zoos stopped basically being 100% bad.

400
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:29,980
Speaker 0: Like they were, I mean, olden times, it was like the king's got a bunch of tigers, like in cages.

401
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:34,760
Speaker 1: They were just, well, that's a menagerie, but that's where zoos came from.

402
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:53,600
Speaker 1: Historically, people were just taking animals, you know, and putting, and you're putting them in cages for the amusement of people and not treating the animals well, not knowing how to treat the animals well, not really caring as long as the people were amused, right, and entertained by being able to get close to an animal.

403
00:32:54,041 --> 00:33:04,280
Speaker 1: That normally would be, you know, a) it's like even before video, it's like you could never, like, you know, someone talked about a tiger, you saw maybe a photo of a tiger or a drawing of a tiger.

404
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:16,940
Speaker 0: Oh my god, remember that ancient thing of the day where a lion skin had been sent somewhere in Europe as a gift and the taxidermist was tasked with filling it out to make it look like a real lion again.

405
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:23,860
Speaker 0: And they had no idea what a lion was supposed to look like and the results were equal parts delightful and terrifying.

406
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,501
Speaker 1: Yep.

407
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:30,045
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, lions don't live where you live, so it's like you will just never see one.

408
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:45,600
Speaker 1: if, you know, and then people made zoos for amusement purposes because like, wow, that's a, you know, in the time where it's like, you know, there wasn't TV, movies, video games, internet, it's like seeing a live lion, that ranks pretty high up there in the entertainment level.

409
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:47,188
Speaker 1: Yep.

410
00:33:47,449 --> 00:33:49,580
Speaker 1: Right up there with intentional train crashes.

411
00:33:52,121 --> 00:34:01,480
Speaker 1: It's like that's where the zoo came from, but then people over time, I guess, you know, realized, hey, this isn't great, this is the opposite of great.

412
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:22,980
Speaker 1: And some portion of the zoos, you know, either shut down, which I guess is good, or B, you know, changed their behavior to being about helping the animals and still having them out for entertainment purposes, but that was just, you know, to get money to help the animals, right, from the spectators.

413
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:23,981
Speaker 0: Yep.

414
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:30,489
Speaker 0: So we're really only going to talk about like modern zoos that we've interacted with or that people like you would interact with.

415
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:37,380
Speaker 0: because if you want to know the full history, there is a very long Wikipedia article that I'm skimming through right now as part of Geek Nights, as those of you on the stream could see.

416
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,840
Speaker 1: And we're not going to do aquariums because we need another episode.

417
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,521
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we do.

418
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:55,380
Speaker 0: Plus, I have different opinions on them and different anecdotes and different thoughts because, you know, as kids get taken to zoos, like that's the thing, and I have a lot of very strong and foundational memories as a child of going to the Detroit Zoo, which...

419
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,119
Speaker 1: I've been to many zoos and zoo-like things.

420
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,431
Speaker 0: We would go to that zoo several times a year because that was just a thing the family would do.

421
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:04,596
Speaker 0: It was like it was a fun day to hang out at the zoo.

422
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:05,919
Speaker 0: There's a lot going on at the zoo.

423
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,495
Speaker 0: As kids, on one hand, we were excited to go to the zoo, but on the other hand, we always tried to convince our parents to take us to Cedar Point instead.

424
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:15,520
Speaker 0: You know, kids.

425
00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:18,260
Speaker 1: Well, there's combos like Busch Gardens.

426
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:24,160
Speaker 1: It seems like a lot of amusement parks have like some sort of safari thing, you know, combo.

427
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:24,843
Speaker 0: Yep.

428
00:35:24,863 --> 00:35:25,456
Speaker 0: Cedar Point had a...

429
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,700
Speaker 1: Disney's got one, right?

430
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:31,449
Speaker 0: I don't know if it still does, but it had a giant aquarium inside the park that we used to go to.

431
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,431
Speaker 0: that was just free.

432
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:34,675
Speaker 0: It was just like part of the park, like you're riding roller coasters.

433
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:37,140
Speaker 0: There's a gigantic, legit aquarium just there.

434
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:50,280
Speaker 0: But the zoo was interesting because part of it was seeing the animals, but as a kid, at least, part of it, I was always just very fascinated with like the operations of a zoo.

435
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,700
Speaker 0: Like how do you make a zoo and how does it work and like how do they get into the enclosures and how do they keep the animals from escaping?

436
00:35:57,381 --> 00:36:03,173
Speaker 0: And as a kid, I was always really fascinated by that kind of stuff and I was always trying to like see behind the scenes and like.

437
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:06,440
Speaker 0: that was just a focus of what I would pay attention to as a kid.

438
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:14,399
Speaker 0: I also kind of wanted to pet the animals and it's a good thing that adults and fences prevented me from doing so or I would have.

439
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:23,600
Speaker 0: But as I get older, I didn't really go to zoos a lot because of, you know, they're a mixed bag and not all of them have great animal welfare.

440
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:36,980
Speaker 0: And I think the first big zoo I went to again, like as an adult, was actually when you and I were in Australia and we went to that zoo in Melbourne and we spent like an entire day there taking photos.

441
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,712
Speaker 1: It was like, you know, it was a few hours.

442
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:39,580
Speaker 1: I don't know, it was the whole day.

443
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,971
Speaker 0: We spent most of the day there.

444
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:41,840
Speaker 0: It wasn't open that long.

445
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:43,079
Speaker 1: It was several hours.

446
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,406
Speaker 0: It was like three.

447
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:47,120
Speaker 0: It was GTFO time and we had to get out.

448
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:50,520
Speaker 0: We got shooed out of the gift shop at the end because they were shutting up.

449
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,900
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, we went to every part of that zoo that they had.

450
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,760
Speaker 0: But it was a good time.

451
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:06,540
Speaker 0: That zoo trip was particularly notable for me because one, we went to a zoo that had animals that aren't in a lot of American zoos.

452
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,380
Speaker 0: There was a very different zoo experience.

453
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:15,700
Speaker 1: And two, I think that if you go to a small zoo, it's going to have just local type animals.

454
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:26,100
Speaker 1: If you go to a bigger zoo, it'll have some exotic animals from parts far away or animals that are more difficult to take care of or difficult to acquire.

455
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:31,820
Speaker 1: And then the mega big zoo, like San Diego Zoo, has got like fucking everything from around the world.

456
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,442
Speaker 0: Oh, how about that?

457
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:37,100
Speaker 0: The Melbourne Zoo is one of the few zoos that has a picture on the front of the Wikipedia article.

458
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:39,860
Speaker 0: It's one of the bigger zoos.

459
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,942
Speaker 1: That is a thing though.

460
00:37:42,003 --> 00:37:50,100
Speaker 1: If you can go to a smaller zoo in a different place, and now you'll see animals that might be hard to see at the zoo where you live.

461
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:53,959
Speaker 1: But they just got those animals easy over there.

462
00:37:56,261 --> 00:37:59,967
Speaker 0: It's always like sometimes you see animals that are perfectly happy.

463
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:08,040
Speaker 0: Like you see a zoo and there's a zebra and the zebra is actually exhibiting happy zebra behaviors and seems pretty happy and at least reasonably comfortable.

464
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:14,280
Speaker 0: But then you see the bear who's clearly having mental health issues because he's bored and trapped in a shitty zoo.

465
00:38:17,043 --> 00:38:23,500
Speaker 0: And as a kid that definitely colored my opinions of zoos because a lot of zoos I saw were not great as a kid.

466
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:31,740
Speaker 0: And I guess unlike a lot of other families, my mom was an expert in animal welfare so she would point these behaviors out to us as kids.

467
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,279
Speaker 0: And I think that really, really impacted how I view zoos in my entire life after that.

468
00:38:38,062 --> 00:38:44,340
Speaker 1: Well I think even if you don't know about animal welfare, looking at the animals, I think it's like you can just sort of tell.

469
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:52,209
Speaker 1: You look at say the enclosure an animal is in and you can tell it's not well kept.

470
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:58,057
Speaker 1: It doesn't take a genius to be like, "Wow, nobody's cleaning that water.

471
00:38:58,117 --> 00:38:59,198
Speaker 1: those penguins are in.

472
00:38:59,218 --> 00:39:00,199
Speaker 1: Look how dirty it

473
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:00,460
Speaker 1: is.".

474
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:08,958
Speaker 0: Or, "I can't read kangaroo body language but that kangaroo looks extremely

475
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:09,439
Speaker 0: bored.".

476
00:39:10,861 --> 00:39:12,577
Speaker 1: Or, "Why is that monkey banging his head on the

477
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:12,799
Speaker 1: wall?".

478
00:39:15,961 --> 00:39:28,800
Speaker 0: There's actually a fantastic lecture I saw a while ago that I think about a lot because it has a very quotable moment where it talks about how on one hand we as humans cannot anthropomorphize every animal we interact with because they are very different intelligences.

479
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,583
Speaker 0: They're very different beings.

480
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:36,152
Speaker 0: Humans often project their own deal onto other things.

481
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:41,000
Speaker 0: I mean look at how many people get weird about the Roomba that dies and have an emotional attachment to it or something.

482
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,712
Speaker 0: So on one hand it's very easy for a human to drastically misunderstand an animal when they project.

483
00:39:46,772 --> 00:39:49,258
Speaker 0: Case in point, the monkey's smiling at me.

484
00:39:49,298 --> 00:39:50,140
Speaker 0: He must be happy.

485
00:39:51,681 --> 00:40:03,180
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, this lecture made a very good point about how animals are individuals and have a sense of self-identity and we do have lots of direct evidence of this.

486
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:13,800
Speaker 0: And while we can't anthropomorphize, at the same time, the most powerful starting point we have to understand what an animal's thinking is by anthropomorphizing them to a degree.

487
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:23,460
Speaker 0: Because since we're an individual and they're an individual, our first best guess as to why they're doing something is the most obvious answer.

488
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,878
Speaker 0: Like all those things that came around Twitter about a year ago where people were like, "Wait, do bears just like hang out and watch the

489
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:29,280
Speaker 0: sunset?".

490
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:41,100
Speaker 0: And the answer appears to be that yes, sometimes bears will just like scoop out a little area, like sit down and get company, and just stare out over the mountains and watch the sunset just like a human would.

491
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:43,468
Speaker 1: It's the most exciting thing they got to see.

492
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:44,291
Speaker 1: They don't got TV.

493
00:40:45,595 --> 00:40:47,000
Speaker 1: They don't got video games.

494
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:54,020
Speaker 0: Plus, I'm an evolved monkey with both TV and video games, and sometimes I'll just go sit and stare out over a sunset.

495
00:40:55,261 --> 00:40:57,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, so.

496
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:59,960
Speaker 1: Alright, so let's review some zoos.

497
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,819
Speaker 0: Alright, honestly, the Melbourne Zoo is the best zoo I've ever been to.

498
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,723
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good zoo.

499
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:06,811
Speaker 1: It might be the best zoo I've ever been to.

500
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:07,874
Speaker 1: It was an excellent zoo.

501
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,803
Speaker 0: The exhibits were varied.

502
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:13,265
Speaker 0: The animals looked very well cared for.

503
00:41:13,285 --> 00:41:15,367
Speaker 0: It was very educational.

504
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:25,300
Speaker 0: It did not have any of the weird, like, it is surprising how much pseudoscientific racist nonsense is embedded in zoos all over the world.

505
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:35,800
Speaker 0: Even if it's not intentional in current day, it's because the exhibit was designed in like the 1910s and they haven't updated it, but there wasn't a lot of that there.

506
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:44,160
Speaker 0: Every person we encountered who was staff, if we asked a question, they knew and gave a, they were just happy that we were talking to them and would overshare.

507
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:47,419
Speaker 0: It was an overall pretty good experience.

508
00:41:49,621 --> 00:41:52,968
Speaker 1: I've been to a lot of New York zoos, right?

509
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:56,136
Speaker 1: So in New York City, there's a few zoos, right?

510
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:57,840
Speaker 1: Mostly the Bronx Zoo is the big one.

511
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:06,760
Speaker 1: But there's also a Central Park Zoo and a Queens, there's a zoo in Queens and they're all actually owned, they're all run by the same organization, right?

512
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,889
Speaker 1: They're all basically the same zoo, just with multiple locations.

513
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,296
Speaker 1: I don't know if they have more locations than those three.

514
00:42:12,356 --> 00:42:12,737
Speaker 1: They might.

515
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:13,780
Speaker 1: I'm just not aware of them.

516
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:18,571
Speaker 1: I haven't been to the Bronx Zoo in many years.

517
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:21,720
Speaker 1: I could go basically whenever I wanted, but I'm mad at the Bronx Zoo.

518
00:42:23,368 --> 00:42:25,620
Speaker 1: So when I was real young, we went to the Bronx Zoo.

519
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,336
Speaker 0: Ooh, a crunch!

520
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:31,025
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

521
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:42,040
Speaker 1: When I was young and I went to the Bronx Zoo, I bought this snow globe there and then it was a big deal later in life because that turned out to be like a rare snow globe among the snow globe peoples.

522
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,822
Speaker 1: So I have a memory of that.

523
00:42:46,283 --> 00:42:51,349
Speaker 1: But then I went to the Bronx Zoo again and a little bit later.

524
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,750
Speaker 1: It's good.

525
00:42:52,770 --> 00:43:00,640
Speaker 1: The Bronx Zoo, at least when I went to it the second time and I was older and I have a better memory of it and they were no longer selling the snow globe.

526
00:43:02,401 --> 00:43:07,671
Speaker 1: It has all kinds of different sections for all the different kinds of animals.

527
00:43:07,691 --> 00:43:12,900
Speaker 1: Unlike the Melbourne one, it was sort of a circle shape like you walk around to get everything.

528
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,192
Speaker 0: More importantly, you would naturally get to each exhibit.

529
00:43:16,212 --> 00:43:18,100
Speaker 0: It suddenly guided you on the best path.

530
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:22,380
Speaker 1: It was like a Stu Leonard's basically where you go in a circle from beginning to end.

531
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:28,915
Speaker 1: The Bronx Zoo, from what I remember of it, is that it's more of a go wherever you want kind of deal.

532
00:43:28,955 --> 00:43:29,917
Speaker 1: Like an amusement park.

533
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:31,040
Speaker 1: Like go here, go there.

534
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:35,186
Speaker 1: It has some really notable parts of it.

535
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:36,829
Speaker 1: Like the monkey house.

536
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,293
Speaker 1: The fact that they have the guts to call it the monkey house.

537
00:43:40,636 --> 00:43:42,099
Speaker 1: I think they might have changed the name of it.

538
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:42,640
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

539
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,679
Speaker 0: The monkey mezzan.

540
00:43:45,481 --> 00:43:46,642
Speaker 1: I don't know what they call it now.

541
00:43:46,742 --> 00:43:50,867
Speaker 1: But it has some good animals there.

542
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:58,937
Speaker 1: But my favorite part of the Bronx Zoo, which is also my mother's favorite part, was the aptly named House of Darkness.

543
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:01,080
Speaker 1: They literally had a house of darkness.

544
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,251
Speaker 0: Which is something I was...

545
00:44:04,806 --> 00:44:05,269
Speaker 1: I'm wrong.

546
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,780
Speaker 1: It was called World of Darkness.

547
00:44:08,861 --> 00:44:11,626
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was basically off onto the side of the zoo.

548
00:44:11,646 --> 00:44:15,572
Speaker 1: It was in the zoo, but not in the main path.

549
00:44:15,972 --> 00:44:21,180
Speaker 1: It was this building with no windows and one double-doored entrance.

550
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,786
Speaker 1: And inside, it was dark.

551
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:28,180
Speaker 1: And in there were all nocturnal animals.

552
00:44:29,742 --> 00:44:35,051
Speaker 1: And I presume that when the animals went to sleep, which they basically had these animals reversed.

553
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:39,580
Speaker 1: They would be night in the building during zoo hours.

554
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:47,240
Speaker 1: And then when the people left, I think, I'm not 100% sure, I just assumed this, that they would turn on the lights and the animals would sleep.

555
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,360
Speaker 0: Seeing little fruit bats eating watermelon in places like that is just an absolute treasure.

556
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:57,290
Speaker 1: So they had all kinds of snakes and reptiles and even underwater.

557
00:44:57,491 --> 00:44:59,695
Speaker 1: They had smaller aquarium tanks.

558
00:45:00,076 --> 00:45:02,000
Speaker 1: I think I might have seen an electric eel in there.

559
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,867
Speaker 1: Things that lived in the deep sea where it's dark.

560
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:07,360
Speaker 1: Any animal that lives where it's dark was in the World of Darkness.

561
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:16,320
Speaker 1: And then in between, granted it was a long period of time, but in between when I went to the Bronx Zoo last, which might have been high school, last millennium.

562
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:24,837
Speaker 1: And now, I feel like it was still quite a while ago, maybe a decade ago or more, they closed the World of Darkness.

563
00:45:24,877 --> 00:45:26,040
Speaker 1: They were like, "Nope, we're done with

564
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:26,200
Speaker 1: that.".

565
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,705
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "What the hell?

566
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,570
Speaker 1: That was the best part of the zoo when you closed it?

567
00:45:29,631 --> 00:45:31,276
Speaker 1: Alright, I don't even know what to

568
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:32,680
Speaker 1: do.".

569
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:37,572
Speaker 1: But I haven't been to the Central Park Zoo because, why?

570
00:45:37,592 --> 00:45:40,180
Speaker 1: I don't feel the compulsion to go there.

571
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:48,540
Speaker 1: But I have been to the Queen Zoo, which is a tiny little zoo out in Corona Park, out near Citi Field and whatnot.

572
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,584
Speaker 1: And it's just a little zoo.

573
00:45:51,968 --> 00:45:55,580
Speaker 1: This one you walk around in a circle, but it won't take you very long at all.

574
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:03,613
Speaker 1: And they got mostly not very exciting animals, more normal animals.

575
00:46:03,633 --> 00:46:07,320
Speaker 1: They got a farm/petting zoo across the street.

576
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:14,050
Speaker 1: And that's cow, sheep, pig, that kind of stuff.

577
00:46:15,552 --> 00:46:18,035
Speaker 1: But in the zoo area, they've got brown bear.

578
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,786
Speaker 1: And it's like, "Okay, they got an

579
00:46:24,906 --> 00:46:25,227
Speaker 1: eagle.".

580
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:25,648
Speaker 1: It's like,

581
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:26,149
Speaker 1: "Alright.".

582
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:30,800
Speaker 1: They got a big dome aviary thing with birds in there.

583
00:46:31,944 --> 00:46:33,369
Speaker 0: I love the bird parts.

584
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:36,319
Speaker 0: Especially the bigger the enclosure is, the more free the birds are.

585
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,723
Speaker 1: It's real big.

586
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:40,619
Speaker 1: It's like a big geodesic kind of enclosure thing.

587
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:49,133
Speaker 1: But the most exciting, the highlight of that zoo is they got a whole sea lion thing.

588
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:52,700
Speaker 1: It's like the largest part of the zoo by far.

589
00:46:53,261 --> 00:47:01,077
Speaker 1: And it's like every few hours or so, they feed the sea lion and it's like, well, sea lions or manatees or whatever.

590
00:47:01,137 --> 00:47:02,420
Speaker 1: I don't know which ones they are.

591
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,286
Speaker 1: I think it's sea lions.

592
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:04,900
Speaker 1: There's even a difference.

593
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,248
Speaker 0: I just have this vague memory as a kid at the Detroit Zoo.

594
00:47:07,308 --> 00:47:10,480
Speaker 0: of all the animals I wanted to see were always asleep and hiding every time we went.

595
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:11,661
Speaker 1: Yep.

596
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:11,942
Speaker 1: Nope.

597
00:47:11,982 --> 00:47:13,389
Speaker 1: This zoo, they're not hiding.

598
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:15,840
Speaker 1: And basically, they bring the sea lions out on a schedule.

599
00:47:17,105 --> 00:47:21,180
Speaker 1: If you go to the zoo, it's like you're going to see it at least once, no matter what.

600
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,401
Speaker 1: And it's like.

601
00:47:22,421 --> 00:47:27,680
Speaker 1: the main event at the Queen Zoo is the feeding of the sea lion.

602
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,570
Speaker 1: But the other, the hidden main event, is they got this tiny little enclosure.

603
00:47:33,492 --> 00:47:35,777
Speaker 1: And you might think, "Oh, what animal's in the tiny enclosure?

604
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:36,238
Speaker 1: That's not

605
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:36,539
Speaker 1: cool.".

606
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,490
Speaker 1: It's this special kind of deer.

607
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,880
Speaker 1: It's the world's tiniest deer.

608
00:47:42,323 --> 00:47:43,479
Speaker 1: Oh, those little guys!

609
00:47:44,101 --> 00:47:46,187
Speaker 1: It's the world's tiniest deer variety.

610
00:47:46,668 --> 00:47:51,320
Speaker 1: And it's just like this really cute, really tiny deer hanging out in there.

611
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:57,180
Speaker 1: It's like, you could miss it easily if you don't go and look for it off in the corner.

612
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,766
Speaker 1: But it's like, you don't see that thing pretty often.

613
00:48:00,866 --> 00:48:02,068
Speaker 1: It's like an animal.

614
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:08,020
Speaker 1: It's like it's one thing to go to a zoo and see an animal that you don't see often.

615
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:10,322
Speaker 1: In person.

616
00:48:10,723 --> 00:48:11,965
Speaker 1: So you go see penguin.

617
00:48:12,105 --> 00:48:14,249
Speaker 1: It's like, you know a penguin exists.

618
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:19,880
Speaker 1: You might not see them that often in person unless you live in the south bottom of the world.

619
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:22,626
Speaker 1: But you know what a penguin is.

620
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:26,880
Speaker 1: So it still has some excitement, but not incredible excitement.

621
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,847
Speaker 1: But it's like, I bet you didn't even know that tiny deer existed.

622
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,017
Speaker 1: And there it is, live, walking around.

623
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,220
Speaker 1: You never even heard of this thing.

624
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:44,420
Speaker 1: It's like, I think that's what I like the most about a zoo, is when you see an animal you didn't even know was an animal, it's almost like meeting an alien kind of deal.

625
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:51,099
Speaker 0: Especially if it's a zoo that's well designed to where you can sort of observe them doing mostly natural behaviors, like they don't even know you're there, is the best.

626
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:59,800
Speaker 0: When we were in Japan, the last time Emily and I were in Japan we went to the zoo, and I just remember for a while I was looking down at this monkey enclosure and there was a little monkey.

627
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:04,828
Speaker 0: And really working on trying to make something with a stick.

628
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:08,596
Speaker 0: There was definitely some attempt at crafting happening down there.

629
00:49:08,937 --> 00:49:10,580
Speaker 0: And it was just fascinating to watch.

630
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:16,551
Speaker 0: But that zoo also had the traditional petting zoo of.

631
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:19,838
Speaker 0: here is a pile of guinea pigs that kids are allowed to manhandle.

632
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:21,060
Speaker 0: that frankly just has to be banned.

633
00:49:21,901 --> 00:49:24,699
Speaker 0: It's just kids hurting little guys.

634
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:39,880
Speaker 0: Like a lot of petting zoos, at least most American petting zoos get it right in that it's animals that kids are unlikely to be able to hurt in any way, but I'm not a fan of the let kids manhandle guinea pigs thing.

635
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,631
Speaker 1: So where I grew up there was a farm, was it kind of a zoo?

636
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:47,940
Speaker 1: I think it's still there, it's called Silverman's Farm.

637
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,499
Speaker 0: We had something similar, you're going as a kid, feed some goats, and feed a horse.

638
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,764
Speaker 1: You get your pumpkins, you get your apple cider there.

639
00:49:55,044 --> 00:50:00,773
Speaker 1: But they had farm animals there, goats, sheep, goose.

640
00:50:01,654 --> 00:50:05,460
Speaker 1: When I was a kid they had a peacock, just one, I don't know if it's still there.

641
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:11,596
Speaker 1: Farm animals, these are animals that are being taken care of as a livestock farm setting.

642
00:50:11,616 --> 00:50:12,720
Speaker 1: A bunch of chickens and a coop.

643
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:31,820
Speaker 1: And there's a wire fence, so you can't really get at the animals, but they would let you put a quarter in a little vending machine, but instead of gumballs food came out and you would hold your hand up to the fence and the animals would all lick the food out of your hand.

644
00:50:33,341 --> 00:50:37,820
Speaker 1: So you couldn't really mess with the animals so much, and I guess that was okay.

645
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:45,905
Speaker 1: But there was another place, the Caskill Game Farm, which has a long and storied history.

646
00:50:45,985 --> 00:51:04,480
Speaker 1: I won't get into, but we went there when I was a kid and that was basically, it's called Caskill Game Farm, but it was like a petting zoo, not too many exotic animals, mostly the same kind of farm animals, but basically they're just all over, you could just mess with them.

647
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:24,757
Speaker 0: We actually had a pleasant surprise, because the last time I was in Australia with Emily, we were hiking in the Blue Mountains and then it rained on the last day so we couldn't do the last hike safely, so we just headed back to the city early, and on the way we see this giant animal exhibit place, and we figure we'll go see.

648
00:51:24,977 --> 00:51:28,980
Speaker 0: what's the deal with this place, is this going to be one of those bad places, what's the deal?

649
00:51:29,561 --> 00:51:38,610
Speaker 0: And we roll in, and it was actually surprisingly better for the animals than we expected, and ended up being a pretty good experience.

650
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:48,820
Speaker 0: We go in and it's mostly the equivalent of what you just described, but for Australia, so it's a lot of wallabies and quokkas and dingos and animals that are just common in Australia.

651
00:51:49,561 --> 00:51:53,640
Speaker 1: Well I mean we did go to that other place in Australia to see the koalas, and that wasn't really a zoo.

652
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:54,480
Speaker 0: It was a preserve.

653
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like a preserve, and it's like they just happen to have a walkway.

654
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:04,897
Speaker 1: It's like this is where koalas live, we'll make a walkway so that you can walk around and see them sleeping 90% of the day.

655
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:18,720
Speaker 0: I like places like that a lot, because that's where a zoo is serving more of its conservation mission, while also teaching people about the animals and letting them see them, but without messing with the animals.

656
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:30,920
Speaker 1: Right, well rather than taking animals and bringing them far away to some other place that they don't belong, and putting them in a box of some kind, it's like you just go to where the animal is, it's like, you know.

657
00:52:31,561 --> 00:52:40,580
Speaker 0: That's also where I learned that you can keep koalas from in or out into, or trap them in or keep them out of a place with a wall that's about a foot tall.

658
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,540
Speaker 1: Like people, I know, pretty much everyone who ever goes to Costa Rica goes to see the sloths, right?

659
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:47,000
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

660
00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:50,046
Speaker 1: It's like, you're going to where the sloth is.

661
00:52:50,286 --> 00:52:55,400
Speaker 1: It's like, I've seen sloths in zoos here, but it's like, you still meet the sloth where he lives.

662
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:06,120
Speaker 0: Well, to see all the flying foxes in Australia, I didn't even go anywhere in particular, I just went to Centennial Park, there's one tree that a whole colony of them lives in, and just walk over there and you just get right up to them.

663
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:12,780
Speaker 0: They're just right there, everyone knows, no one messes with them, it's not even official, it's just that's where they live, and it's super cool.

664
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:22,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, Castle Game Farm has been closed for quite a while, I think it was for sale, it might still be for sale, someone tried to renovate it into a hotel unsuccessfully.

665
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:26,179
Speaker 1: And I think lost a lot of money on it last I heard, and that's why they're trying to sell it.

666
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,360
Speaker 1: But I don't think they're going to be able to recoup their investment, they're going to have to just realize they made a bad investment.

667
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:37,360
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's a good thing that place shut down, because it was not a great place for the animals.

668
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:46,860
Speaker 0: But that place we went to in Australia, in the end, the thing I thought was nice about it is the kangaroos and wallabies and a lot of the animals just wandering around, and you can just interact with them.

669
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:55,100
Speaker 0: And they had hay dispensers, basically hay in an ice cream cone without the ice cream, so you could just feed them if they wanted it.

670
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:06,480
Speaker 0: But all the animals that were able to be interacted with with humans, there were little ropes, and they had all these signs everywhere that basically said if an animal goes behind these ropes, you can't fuck with them, leave them alone.

671
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:15,140
Speaker 0: So an animal that was done with your shit had a very easy way to get away from you and avoid human entanglement if they didn't want to deal with it.

672
00:54:15,682 --> 00:54:19,859
Speaker 0: And it seemed like that system for those kinds of animals actually worked pretty well.

673
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:29,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, if the animal is an animal that learns that that's a place where there's no people, the animal will learn that.

674
00:54:29,577 --> 00:54:31,160
Speaker 1: A dog can learn that super easily.

675
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:33,865
Speaker 1: A lot of other animals can learn that as well.

676
00:54:34,587 --> 00:54:39,700
Speaker 1: And that's actually probably not a bad system to set up for a pet if you have one either.

677
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:45,180
Speaker 1: I think the only problem might be, let's say you have a dog, if it's sick it might hide in there.

678
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,642
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, well we do that.

679
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:55,120
Speaker 0: Mookie has a tunnel that he sleeps in, but dogs, often you have a crate, because you need to be able to get a dog in a crate if you have to take him to the vet or something.

680
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,524
Speaker 0: So the crate is like the safe space.

681
00:54:57,985 --> 00:55:02,894
Speaker 0: The contract is, listen dog, I will only fuck with you in the crate if it's an emergency.

682
00:55:03,234 --> 00:55:06,120
Speaker 0: So you are safe in there unless you're going to the vet.

683
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:12,500
Speaker 1: So that's the thing animals learn, that's sort of natural, you don't even really need to train them.

684
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,827
Speaker 0: I remember the first year, it was the 4th of July.

685
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:18,440
Speaker 1: You just set up a place, put them in it, and then don't go in there.

686
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:24,049
Speaker 0: When we got Miles as a puppy, the first year there were fireworks that he was around for.

687
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:30,640
Speaker 0: The first firework went off, and he was in that crate and even pulled the door shut and hid in there until they stopped.

688
00:55:31,506 --> 00:55:33,179
Speaker 1: Yep, that's how it's going to be.

689
00:55:34,181 --> 00:55:48,140
Speaker 0: But I think zoos and things like them are pretty important, because a lot of humans, especially in places like the US, don't seem to ever really interact with animals.

690
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:57,720
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't even have pets, don't know people who have pets, and just, I think there's a certain amount of human empathy that can only really be learned by interacting with animals.

691
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:04,219
Speaker 0: If nothing else, to instill the sense of awe, like, you know a tiger exists, but imagine you'd never seen a tiger in person.

692
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:13,680
Speaker 0: And you don't give a shit about animals, and then you go to a zoo one day, and you actually see how big a tiger actually is in real life, up close.

693
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:16,775
Speaker 0: And if you somehow have never seen a tiger, you see it move.

694
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:29,320
Speaker 0: They're so much bigger than you realize, and you see them move their paw or their foot even a little bit, and you see those gigantic muscles, you see them roar or fight or do something.

695
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:36,420
Speaker 0: I think that sense of awe and wonder is important to get humans to care even the tiniest bit about the natural world.

696
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,770
Speaker 1: It's like you wonder what it would be like to see a dinosaur, right?

697
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:42,420
Speaker 1: It's like, seeing an elephant ain't too much different.

698
00:56:44,162 --> 00:56:44,945
Speaker 1: It's a big animal.

699
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:47,294
Speaker 0: It's a big animal that isn't around anymore.

700
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,180
Speaker 1: On

701
00:56:49,340 --> 00:57:10,820
Speaker 0: one hand, this is likely worse for the animals than just being wild, but on the other hand, making sure some percentage of humans care at all about animals is probably more important to the welfare of the rest of the animals long-term than the discomfort of the small number of animals that are almost sacrificed to the zoo.

702
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:17,420
Speaker 0: Of course, zoos need to have strong regulations to where that sacrifice has to be minimized as much as possible.

703
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:25,580
Speaker 1: Well, I think if zoos hadn't existed historically for bad reasons, that they wouldn't have come into existence later.

704
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:33,360
Speaker 0: I think they would've in a different form, but I think they are going to be a major part of how we convince humans to care at all about climate change.

705
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:34,320
Speaker 1: Right.

706
00:57:34,361 --> 00:57:35,364
Speaker 1: Well, I do think that's.

707
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:36,527
Speaker 1: the thing is that, you know...

708
00:57:41,284 --> 00:57:42,899
Speaker 0: Better help them adapt to climate change?

709
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,636
Speaker 1: You don't need to let people go to those, the publican, right?

710
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:47,400
Speaker 1: That's the real thing.

711
00:57:47,822 --> 00:57:49,020
Speaker 1: Or, you let people in.

712
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:52,066
Speaker 1: You can do a lot of the functions that zoos serve, right?

713
00:57:52,086 --> 00:57:58,740
Speaker 1: Like all the zoos that get the pandas to mate so that there are still pandas, even though pandas don't seem to want there to be pandas anymore.

714
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,120
Speaker 0: I've read a fascinating thing that...

715
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:05,610
Speaker 1: You don't need to let the public just have access to it, even for a price.

716
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:10,340
Speaker 1: That could just be a private facility that employees go to, and that's it.

717
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:21,140
Speaker 0: I think some of the best hybrid models are places where their primary mission is that, but their mission is also outreach, and then people can come in to observe those practices.

718
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:29,200
Speaker 0: And see some representation of the animals, but not necessarily in the open format amusement park style of a lot of zoos.

719
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:38,999
Speaker 0: There's also the animal ambassadors of like, you find the one wolf who's like weirdly cool with people, and you basically just

720
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,020
Speaker 1: use them,

721
00:58:40,381 --> 00:58:47,630
Speaker 0: like bring them to schools, let people interact with them, like they're the ambassador for their species to the people who need that to be convinced to care.

722
00:58:49,350 --> 00:59:01,650
Speaker 0: Which is a thing, kind of like pets, like there's pros and cons to allowing humans to have pets, but in the end, people who have pets demonstrably are more likely to demonstrate empathy in their adult lives than people who don't.

723
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:10,710
Speaker 0: There's lots of quality of life and like human learning aspects, so it's a very nuanced topic that we are not experts enough to talk about too much further.

724
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:19,510
Speaker 0: So zoos are a mixed bag, and I think will continue to be a mixed bag, but I think their importance is actually only going to grow as their mission changes due to climate change.

725
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:30,770
Speaker 1: So there also might be animals that, you know, it's like right now, there's some animals, right, where it's like, you know, maybe they grew up in captivity or something and they can't survive in the wild for whatever reason, right?

726
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:38,710
Speaker 1: So it's like, rather than let the animal go extinct, right, it's like a zoo is where it can actually live, sadly, that's the only choice, right?

727
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:44,650
Speaker 1: But I think with climate change and also other reasons, habitat destruction, burning rainforests, et cetera, et cetera.

728
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:45,412
Speaker 0: Well, there's a balance.

729
00:59:45,472 --> 00:59:53,510
Speaker 0: Some species we can help to repopulate or help survive, other species just will not be able to live in the world that we've made.

730
00:59:54,390 --> 01:00:19,750
Speaker 1: Right, we're making it, there are other people who are making a shitty world and, you know, as a side effect, you know, eliminating some animal species, and it's like, well, it's like that animal species is better off in the wild, but some other fucker destroyed the wild, and now there is no wild anymore for that particular animal, so we can, the animal can either live in the zoo or not live because of that other piece of shit that did that.

731
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:36,830
Speaker 0: Well, that lecture that talks about, you know, the whole, like, watching an animal and thinking and just intuitively understand, like, oh, that rabbit's frustrated because he's trying to get under the bed and you've blocked it off, and he's mad at you because he saw you block it off, and he's frustrated and looking for, like, your first best guess at their behavior.

732
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:49,990
Speaker 0: He had a bit at the end, he mostly talked about how, like, the question is, are humans compassionate enough and also brave enough to actually make a world that we can share with animals, or are we just going to keep destroying everything?

733
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,330
Speaker 1: Hopefully aliens will come and put humans in the zoo.

734
01:00:54,370 --> 01:01:04,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, we're really speedrunning the lead up to the Bell Riots in Star Trek right now, except I don't think Vulcans are going to show up and cause us to cease warring with each other anytime soon.

735
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:06,352
Speaker 1: But I'm saying, you know, you think about it this way, right?

736
01:01:06,472 --> 01:01:11,398
Speaker 1: So, you know, on the one hand, it's like all our climate damaging is going to kill humans.

737
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:22,610
Speaker 1: If somebody came and put us in a zoo, right, it's like the same way the pandas go in the zoo, it's like, oh, thanks aliens for helping, you know, it's like, yeah, we live in a zoo, we don't like it, there's no internet in there.

738
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:25,175
Speaker 1: But at least there's still humans.

739
01:01:25,396 --> 01:01:32,450
Speaker 1: It's like, if the choice is be extinct on Earth or be in the alien zoo, right, I'm not going to be hypocritical.

740
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:33,626
Speaker 0: I mean, it might be the shitty alien zoo.

741
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:41,049
Speaker 1: Right, sure, but I'm not going to be hypocritical and be like, yeah, it's better for the animal to go in the human zoo.

742
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:42,527
Speaker 0: Of course, at the same time.

743
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,930
Speaker 1: It's also acceptable for the human to go in the alien zoo.

744
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:49,890
Speaker 0: If aliens found Earth, they might be like, well, bacteria clearly rule this planet.

745
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,369
Speaker 1: The tiny aliens.

746
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:57,650
Speaker 0: Bacteria have made these giant structures to house them and move them around.

747
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:02,290
Speaker 1: Yes, the aliens perhaps are bacteria.

748
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:06,326
Speaker 0: We're studying one of the bacteria skyscrapers and it made a weird noise when we cut it open.

749
01:02:06,346 --> 01:02:07,230
Speaker 0: I wonder what that was all about.

750
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:12,710
Speaker 1: I mean, it is possible that like we've been visited by aliens that are just five celled organisms or something.

751
01:02:14,215 --> 01:02:15,027
Speaker 1: Who knows what they are.

752
01:02:15,951 --> 01:02:17,518
Speaker 0: So, yeah, zoos, mixed bag.

753
01:02:17,638 --> 01:02:20,370
Speaker 0: I have good memories of going to some, bad memories of going to others.

754
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:23,910
Speaker 0: I think they serve an important place in the world, but their mission needs to evolve.

755
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,660
Speaker 1: I do enjoy going to a zoo.

756
01:02:25,841 --> 01:02:27,290
Speaker 1: I'll probably go to one again someday.

757
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:30,710
Speaker 0: You know where I absolutely want to go back specifically?

758
01:02:31,111 --> 01:02:33,450
Speaker 0: I do want to go back to Phillip Island and see all those fairy penguins again.

759
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,149
Speaker 0: That was actually, that was a really fun night.

760
01:02:38,532 --> 01:02:43,130
Speaker 1: I wonder if there's another, I wonder if there's a one of those type of things, just a different animal somewhere else.

761
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,409
Speaker 0: Yes, there absolutely are.

762
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:47,990
Speaker 1: Right, I'd rather go to one of those than see an animal I saw already.

763
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:50,096
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to go out.

764
01:02:50,317 --> 01:02:54,050
Speaker 0: We got a lot of fun looking at the bats at night and seeing all their business when they get active.

765
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:58,430
Speaker 0: But there are tours in places like Australia to do that for all sorts of animals.

766
01:02:59,332 --> 01:03:03,150
Speaker 1: In fact, Scott, you want to go upstate and camp at the wolf sanctuary?

767
01:03:03,771 --> 01:03:05,489
Speaker 0: We're thinking about going with Red and some other people too.

768
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:12,610
Speaker 1: I will say this though, I think I said this in 2012 when we did an episode about Pax Australia that we went to.

769
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:17,670
Speaker 1: But we did the penguin thing, we paid for the deluxe penguin experience.

770
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:22,930
Speaker 1: Up until that point in my life, I've always paid for standard experience of everything.

771
01:03:24,453 --> 01:03:27,308
Speaker 1: It always felt like a ripoff to pay more to get the deluxe edition.

772
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:32,290
Speaker 0: Well, the difference between the regular, the premium, and then the special thing we did.

773
01:03:32,652 --> 01:03:34,150
Speaker 0: One, the price wasn't that different.

774
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,723
Speaker 1: And two, the price was that different.

775
01:03:36,763 --> 01:03:38,030
Speaker 1: We just had money finally.

776
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:44,270
Speaker 0: True, but the difference in what you get was like, they were like completely different things.

777
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:52,068
Speaker 0: They would be like, "Alright, you can play Counter Strike or for $100 more, we're going to give you airsoft guns and we're going to do it for real in this giant

778
01:03:52,108 --> 01:03:52,509
Speaker 0: warehouse.".

779
01:03:53,452 --> 01:04:01,170
Speaker 1: The point is, I think when it comes to a zoo type situation, especially if it's the good zoo or zoo-like place.

780
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:04,450
Speaker 0: The non-intrusive, guided, expert access.

781
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:16,270
Speaker 1: If it's a non-evil, animal caretaking place, I would encourage people who can afford to do so to get whatever the deluxe experience is for two reasons.

782
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:26,370
Speaker 1: Number one, you'll have a better, fancier experience getting closer to animals, experiences that other people aren't going to have, something memorable, it's worth your money.

783
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:32,610
Speaker 1: And two, if it's a good place, they need more money to help take care of the animals.

784
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:35,270
Speaker 1: And that's a way that you can give them more money.

785
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:42,330
Speaker 0: And it's not like we were messing with the prairie penguins, we were sitting silently with night vision goggles, watching them from the distance.

786
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:57,790
Speaker 0: Oh, so one last thing the listener pointed out, the pair David Deer, the little guy, survived being wiped out in China because some rich European Duke bred them from a small population from the Berlin Zoo and later reintroduced them into China.

787
01:05:00,801 --> 01:05:03,820
Speaker 1: Is that what the world's smallest deer species is?

788
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,148
Speaker 0: Which deer is which?

789
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:10,120
Speaker 0: I'm looking up what that pair David- It's a pudu fawn, the world's smallest deer.

790
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,400
Speaker 0: Oh no, a pair David is a gigantic, it's a totally different deer.

791
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:16,553
Speaker 0: Oh, those are the guys with the really thi- okay, the really thi-.

792
01:05:16,593 --> 01:05:17,979
Speaker 0: I see this guy, look at him.

793
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:32,180
Speaker 1: It's a pudu fawn, p-u-d-u, it is categorized as vulnerable, but yeah, it is a- it's a really tiny deer, it's like, smaller than most dogs, it's like a foot long, basically.

794
01:05:33,942 --> 01:05:36,360
Speaker 0: Alright, I think it's time to get dinner and then go play some Fortnite.

795
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,656
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

796
01:05:44,696 --> 01:05:49,690
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

799
01:05:58,178 --> 01:06:02,310
Speaker 0: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

802
01:07:02,381 --> 01:07:03,222
Speaker 0: I will not say.

803
01:07:03,523 --> 01:07:43,267
Speaker 0: We are back from our hiatus, we will be mostly regularly scheduled for much of the rest of the summer, and for tonight, since I'm about to bounce and play some Fortnite, I simply leave you with... Well then, if you're going to push me... I would choose the right-hand weevil.

804
01:07:43,327 --> 01:07:47,480
Speaker 0: It has significant advantage in both length and breadth.

805
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,367
Speaker 0: There, I have you.

806
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:50,778
Speaker 0: You're completely dished.

807
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:57,140
Speaker 1: Do you not know that in the service, one must always choose the lesser of two weevils?
