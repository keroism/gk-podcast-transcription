1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:18,470
Speaker 0: It's Thursday April 7th 2011 I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight MichioKaku's hyperspace on the geek nights book club.

2
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:23,023
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

3
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:35,509
Speaker 0: It was kind of amazing at work that and I'm sitting there do working on some code or something and suddenly Suddenly I noticed that that didn't really matter.

4
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,257
Speaker 0: the market dropped like point six percent.

5
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:39,300
Speaker 1: Is that a lot?

6
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:41,567
Speaker 1: The whole market almost 1%.

7
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:42,830
Speaker 1: yeah, there's one almost at six.

8
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:57,320
Speaker 0: So basically think about this the market dips six Suddenly and I see all these alarms like ah, and I wonder alright what happened?

9
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,730
Speaker 0: I have CNBC and everything on and all the news feeds and there's nothing.

10
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:02,836
Speaker 0: I go to FARC and there's nothing.

11
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:13,700
Speaker 0: I go to Twitter And I just start to see a couple of tweets Coming in about aftershock and then minutes later the news is like oh shit and aftershock hit Japan.

12
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:16,460
Speaker 0: Everything's mostly okay, you know and all the news after that.

13
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:24,689
Speaker 0: But the fact that the market reacted before I think any human on the at least in the United States Knew that there was an aftershock was amazing.

14
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,295
Speaker 1: Well, this is something I wonder about right?

15
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:27,319
Speaker 1: It's like where did that?

16
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,214
Speaker 1: movement come from right.

17
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:38,233
Speaker 1: so I We know that there are people out there who have trading systems hooked up to news feeds But they wouldn't be able to react for minutes.

18
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:41,307
Speaker 0: also little-known fact you think you know there are different ways to do news feeds.

19
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:48,358
Speaker 0: one way is to just consume a feed of like text news and Do some sort of you know algorithm to parse out words or whatever.

20
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,739
Speaker 1: Yes There could have been someone on the AP wire which may have been fast But most could have been a human doing it.

21
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,869
Speaker 0: But most people respond.

22
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,263
Speaker 0: the news feeds that you hear about are actually Scores.

23
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:03,540
Speaker 0: someone else does all the work for you with proprietary whatevers and they send you a score.

24
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:07,280
Speaker 0: That's like good or bad for this sector or this stuff, right?

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,937
Speaker 1: But that person is analyzing the same internet news that we're analyzing.

26
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,256
Speaker 0: Yes So my guess as to what happened and obviously I'm not speaking to any particular stock.

27
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:18,760
Speaker 0: Nor am I giving investment advice?

28
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:20,128
Speaker 1: Is that?

29
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:21,098
Speaker 1: let me call the SEC?

30
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,387
Speaker 1: I'll see what they think about.

31
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:24,259
Speaker 0: is that because it happened in Japan, right?

32
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:31,980
Speaker 0: So there were reactions in the financial sector in Japan which triggered things in the u.s Almost immediately.

33
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:36,200
Speaker 1: So the Japanese people clicked on, you know manually trade.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,903
Speaker 1: Oh, no Because the market was open and then those movements were automatically detected by computer systems in the u.s That automatically trade.

35
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:51,487
Speaker 0: my other guess is that or Japanese people traded on the American exchanges now There's a latency back to the u.s.

36
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:52,209
Speaker 0: And then to Japan.

37
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:53,112
Speaker 0: again is pretty high.

38
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,496
Speaker 0: the market react, but it's not.

39
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:55,760
Speaker 1: it's not minutes.

40
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,400
Speaker 0: No, it's not minutes, but it was just kind of amazing.

41
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:04,360
Speaker 0: Remember when people were pointing out that the tweets are far faster than actual earthquakes.

42
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:06,411
Speaker 1: Yeah, so here's it.

43
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:08,020
Speaker 1: This gave me an idea actually.

44
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:18,800
Speaker 1: So these people are trading based on news right from the news, you know And they're trying to parse things that journalists have written or the AP is written in English to make trades.

45
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:22,310
Speaker 0: Well, most people are parsing more complex data feeds.

46
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:25,420
Speaker 0: that score the news based, right?

47
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Speaker 1: But it's based on looking at news written in English, which is then turned into a score.

48
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:30,926
Speaker 0: Oh, yes to a degree though.

49
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:38,050
Speaker 0: I just want to qualify that some of that news is actually Formatted in kind of reliable ways like it's normalized data.

50
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,179
Speaker 0: Like I don't know corporate actions that happen.

51
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,045
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Yeah, I'm sure.

52
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,559
Speaker 1: so here's an idea I had.

53
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:50,020
Speaker 1: What if we put sensors all over the world of different varieties, for example detected disaster in cell, right?

54
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:57,464
Speaker 1: We have a size a seismograph in Japan and if we can program it to put it connected to a computer Or it is a computer.

55
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:06,373
Speaker 1: if the earth if there's too much earthquake in this area cell You could be way faster than the guy parsing the news and we would get out.

56
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,338
Speaker 0: There's no guy parsing the news.

57
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:09,200
Speaker 0: It's algos.

58
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,558
Speaker 1: I'm just saying is it would be faster than the news algorithm because those few seconds where someone types in that news story We're beating them.

59
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,944
Speaker 0: Well, the news I'll see.

60
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:23,640
Speaker 0: the way to use a news feed like that is more to prime other decision-making systems.

61
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,890
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter we can make money because it'd be faster.

62
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,220
Speaker 1: You're saying milliseconds usually count this work.

63
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,398
Speaker 1: This is on the order of seconds.

64
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:30,523
Speaker 0: So here's the trouble.

65
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:33,091
Speaker 0: you can't guarantee that the market will drop or not.

66
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,880
Speaker 0: a similar earthquake in a different place in a different time Wouldn't have had this reaction and the market recovered almost all the way.

67
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,760
Speaker 1: Well, this is why you have to have you know, it's not just a simple decision hooked up to the data.

68
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,600
Speaker 1: It's you have the algo hooked up to this raw data of and not just a site one seismograph in Japan, right?

69
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,267
Speaker 1: I'm talking about get all kinds of data.

70
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:53,556
Speaker 1: hook it up to weather stations around the world.

71
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:56,243
Speaker 0: I can guarantee Seismographs.

72
00:04:56,504 --> 00:05:08,275
Speaker 0: I can guarantee taking photos in Scott Scott I can guarantee to you that there are small outfits out there that are looking at the goddamn weather and trying to see how it Correlates to stocks, but I'm saying not just whether right.

73
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:09,320
Speaker 1: that's just one example.

74
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:18,000
Speaker 1: Everything they're looking at anything they can get sudden the checks like radio active radio wave activity, you know and stuff like that.

75
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:26,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there's any Possible link so increase we can detects increased cell phone and Wi-Fi activity in localized areas We got.

76
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:29,874
Speaker 0: if there's any possible link to anything people are doing it.

77
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:35,765
Speaker 1: I don't know I haven't heard about anyone doing these sorts of things Anything about how it even works.

78
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:43,208
Speaker 1: we can hook it sign up to you know, detecting tides and ocean movements and Yeah, you could yeah.

79
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:46,245
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, you got any news?

80
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:46,807
Speaker 0: It's Thursday.

81
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:47,971
Speaker 0: We can talk about whatever we want.

82
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:55,060
Speaker 1: You know, we often give Government a hard time because you know, it doesn't usually do stuff that makes us happy.

83
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:58,665
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially when it's making laws We usually does a bad job.

84
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:04,655
Speaker 0: the worst thing is we're getting to getting better pretty much constantly except The years and Bush was in office.

85
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:12,438
Speaker 0: Oh But it's getting better just because we're smarter and we have more access to information than previous generations.

86
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,891
Speaker 0: as a whole We're very aware of the glacial pace of change.

87
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:23,932
Speaker 1: But anyway, I just wanted to you know Highlight a good law and what I consider to be a good law.

88
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:24,915
Speaker 0: a good law.

89
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:25,637
Speaker 1: You might disagree.

90
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:26,820
Speaker 1: It's a new good law.

91
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,905
Speaker 1: It's a New York law.

92
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:31,140
Speaker 1: It's just a few weeks old right, but it's really good.

93
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:42,393
Speaker 1: so basically there was this problem and the problem was is that you know, the vast majority of Crimes and especially assaults and batteries and those sorts of things are domestic disturbances.

94
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,498
Speaker 0: Yep closed-door versus open-door crimes.

95
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:59,540
Speaker 1: Yes now The fact is I wasn't aware of this problem right that a lot of people when they get mad You know instead of punching and kicking or beating with a frying pan or whatever They do some strangling activity and maybe they don't strangle someone to death.

96
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,269
Speaker 1: But you know, they give someone a nice choke, right?

97
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:03,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what happened?

98
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:04,115
Speaker 0: I mean, what?

99
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:05,680
Speaker 0: what's the phrase choke a motherfucker?

100
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,402
Speaker 0: That's right.

101
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:07,045
Speaker 0: Choke a bitch.

102
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:19,468
Speaker 1: Apparently what was happening for a very long time Is that when you choke somebody there wasn't a whole lot of evidence because by the time anyone gets there You're done gasping for air, right?

103
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,214
Speaker 1: You didn't really leave any bruises.

104
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:29,387
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz if you choked him enough to bruise him There's probably enough permanent injury, you know, and you know, there might have been red marks around your neck But they fade.

105
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,992
Speaker 0: so Scott.

106
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,480
Speaker 0: I just want to point out We're gonna have to have a second follow-up law now or follow-up forensic evidence.

107
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,474
Speaker 0: We need a way to handle the sack full of doorknobs problem.

108
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:50,520
Speaker 1: I know but anyway anyway The point is is that a lot of people who strangled somebody We're getting away with it or getting very reduced sentences because of the lack of evidence of the lack of quality evidence.

109
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:52,667
Speaker 1: There is a new law in New York.

110
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:53,890
Speaker 1: It's just a few weeks old.

111
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,856
Speaker 1: That's basically like it's an.

112
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:57,060
Speaker 1: it's a strangling law.

113
00:07:57,221 --> 00:08:00,434
Speaker 1: It's like strangling is illegal and this is what you do if there's a strangling.

114
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:01,137
Speaker 1: All right.

115
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,266
Speaker 1: All right, and So far how many people?

116
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:07,075
Speaker 1: how many times do you think they have used the strangling law?

117
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,600
Speaker 1: in just a few weeks now?

118
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,267
Speaker 1: You won't even a month.

119
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,175
Speaker 1: How many times do you think this law has been used?

120
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:13,200
Speaker 0: to quote Futurama?

121
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,876
Speaker 0: You wouldn't ask unless it was either really high or really low.

122
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:22,054
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say So far in just less than a month, right?

123
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:26,064
Speaker 1: They have arrested Two Thousand people.

124
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:30,500
Speaker 1: how many bitches need choking first strangling with this new law?

125
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,720
Speaker 1: So there you go a quality new law that seems to be working.

126
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:41,068
Speaker 1: Government did a good thing for once in How do you know?

127
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,659
Speaker 0: they're not arresting people who didn't actually strangle?

128
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,540
Speaker 1: There's actually some interesting things in this law about like if there was a strangling then you got it.

129
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:57,034
Speaker 1: Then that means that you have to investigate DNA evidence Which previously they would not investigate in such a case and such and such.

130
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,559
Speaker 1: so there's actually here.

131
00:08:58,964 --> 00:08:59,433
Speaker 1: Here's what it is.

132
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:06,720
Speaker 1: The new law recognized the serious in the offense and has teeth sharp enough to keep a convicted offender behind bars or under scrutiny.

133
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:13,020
Speaker 1: Under the new strangulation law anyone convicted of either felony or misdemeanor counts must submit a DNA sample to authorities.

134
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:14,746
Speaker 1: So yeah, yada yada.

135
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:18,760
Speaker 1: So basically if you're if there's a strangling involved, right?

136
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:28,720
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a whole bunch more Evidence right to actually make sure that that the you know It sticks as opposed to getting away with it because there wasn't any bruising or whatever.

137
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:38,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the and since most of these strangling people are people who've had run-ins with the law previously They've got DNA on them so they can look at the person's neck and say yeah This dude is strangled.

138
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,259
Speaker 1: and then what are you gonna do about it?

139
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,242
Speaker 0: What now?

140
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:43,388
Speaker 0: the next step of course is what do we do about this?

141
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:56,828
Speaker 0: because all domestic violence and you know crimes of passion like that in general are Usually driven by poor impulse control which is correlated with all sorts of things ranging from bad Nutrition to bad upbringing.

142
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:57,410
Speaker 1: it says here.

143
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:03,612
Speaker 1: domestic abusers aren't usually first-time offenders And we're expecting to see that as people get convicted of these offenses.

144
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,640
Speaker 1: It will lead to solving other crimes.

145
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,207
Speaker 1: Ah, but what you find?

146
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:10,140
Speaker 1: a guy who's strangling somebody he's probably done something else.

147
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:13,729
Speaker 1: You found him and you look and you say oh, yeah This is the guy who did the whatever.

148
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:17,170
Speaker 0: so you find a guy who's guilty of I don't know some computer a crime.

149
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,640
Speaker 0: Oh, he might be doing weed.

150
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:21,967
Speaker 0: maybe That's a bad path.

151
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:23,678
Speaker 1: That is well, but you know, but that's just.

152
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:26,192
Speaker 1: you know There's nothing you can do about that as long as the weeds illegal.

153
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:30,758
Speaker 1: There's a separate issue from the strangling Yeah, and plus, you know now the Boston Strangler will get him.

154
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, because he totally wouldn't have done it.

155
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:48,944
Speaker 1: I know he was getting away with it all those years But now finally it you know, the glacial pace of government after how many centuries we finally made it illegal to strangle Luckily just hit the Boston Strang just in time for the government to shut itself down Whatever.

156
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,060
Speaker 1: It's the New York government at the federal government.

157
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,110
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's kind of this thing where?

158
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,398
Speaker 0: because we argue I the thing is we were just arguing in the forum about the problem.

159
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:56,619
Speaker 0: where?

160
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,780
Speaker 0: Laws are often passed with a supposed deterrent effect, even though the punishments are shown to not actually deter.

161
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:12,640
Speaker 0: But in a case like this where there's clear evidence of recidivism and linked crimes It seems like this is a case where it will be a deterrent.

162
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,163
Speaker 1: Well, this is.

163
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:15,175
Speaker 1: this is basically a case of law.

164
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,080
Speaker 1: was no good, right?

165
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,396
Speaker 1: It's we had laws against a certain thing, but there was a loophole.

166
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:23,160
Speaker 1: you can get away with it If you strangled instead of punching someone in the face, so people were strangling.

167
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,120
Speaker 1: So now you can't get away with it just cuz you're strangling now.

168
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:26,904
Speaker 0: That's perfect.

169
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:28,693
Speaker 0: That does imply a secondary thing.

170
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:42,620
Speaker 0: if this is true it implies that there is a significant number of people or are who Wanted to punch someone and then had they had that moment of restraint where they thought oh shit I might get caught if I punch them.

171
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,959
Speaker 1: I think it was more than they happen to strangle and then they happen to get away with it because they did.

172
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:54,593
Speaker 0: or Maybe strength is choking a bitch Requires far more dedication to your choking cause.

173
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,340
Speaker 0: I mean if you want, but they weren't choking him to death.

174
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,310
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get away with that.

175
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:58,280
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but even a little bit.

176
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,577
Speaker 0: I mean I punch someone like say I get mad I go BAM and I punch someone.

177
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:12,820
Speaker 0: All right Maybe I'm not mad three seconds later, but it only took me a half a second to punch But to start to even reach out and start strangling by the time you're proper choking.

178
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:25,245
Speaker 0: It's been some seconds And if you want to maintain that joke for any reasonable amount of time, you gotta really want it because they're gonna fight back Unless you're just way bigger than Fighting back.

179
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:26,430
Speaker 0: So you had a good law.

180
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:28,300
Speaker 0: Let's talk about a bad law.

181
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:37,003
Speaker 0: I learned recently that kuya hoga which is the name of the guy who accidentally caused dude, bro My shit is fucked up.

182
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:38,569
Speaker 1: It's his internet name is cool.

183
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,389
Speaker 0: So I got to shoot slash slice you it's straight-up dog - no It's dude, bro.

184
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:44,597
Speaker 1: My shit is fucked up.

185
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,298
Speaker 0: So I got It's straight.

186
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:52,375
Speaker 0: Well kuya hoga is also the name of a town kuya hoga Falls.

187
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:53,380
Speaker 1: I've heard of this town.

188
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:54,146
Speaker 0: I've heard of it.

189
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,391
Speaker 1: now that I think about that I knew if you said what's kuya hoga Falls.

190
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,660
Speaker 1: I would have said a town in the Midwest.

191
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, but before we're like yeah, and this guy?

192
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:01,309
Speaker 1: where is it?

193
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:02,613
Speaker 1: in the Midwest, Ohio?

194
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:03,676
Speaker 1: Oh, it makes sense.

195
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:10,187
Speaker 0: Yeah, kuya hoga kuya hoga Falls has a Really white mare.

196
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:30,220
Speaker 0: No, and this really white mare is afraid of those goth kids with their piercings and those gangbangers hanging out on the riverfront Intimidating everybody else and these dangerous kids listening to their quote hippity-hop music hanging out under bridges.

197
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:39,940
Speaker 1: So the old people voted for an old guy And the old guy got nowhere to hang out in town except for the old cool bridges down by the boardwalk.

198
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,800
Speaker 0: So this story is great because the what he's done.

199
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:47,440
Speaker 1: Why does he make a park for the kids to hang out and so they don't hang out in the riverfront because they got nowhere?

200
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,119
Speaker 0: Oh, so maybe they were.

201
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:59,861
Speaker 0: But his town much like my town when I was a kid after I moved out of Detroit He has passed or proposed to pass a curfew for anyone under 18.

202
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:01,928
Speaker 1: The other under 18, that's the law we can do.

203
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless maybe we signed the Human Rights Accord.

204
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

205
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:12,480
Speaker 0: So I have many things to say about this article and it's just funny that it happened to take place in kuya hoga Falls.

206
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:16,741
Speaker 1: Of course, I greatly disagree with this idea of a curfew, but they're under 18.

207
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:21,220
Speaker 1: That's law and you know, I want to change that law a great deal, but nothing I could do.

208
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:21,903
Speaker 0: No, but I still did.

209
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:27,511
Speaker 0: you can disagree with the law independent of the realities of voting But here's my reality.

210
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:28,760
Speaker 0: is the Constitution point the one?

211
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,224
Speaker 1: Alright, maybe

212
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:48,985
Speaker 0: if this guy just had a generic statement and a generic law like we're gonna have a curfew because of rising crime Rising youth related crime something like that The fact that he earnestly is afraid of people with piercings and goth style clothing and spiky hair and Hanging out under bridges.

213
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:52,580
Speaker 0: It's like he's afraid of the opening montage from the Lost Boys.

214
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:56,430
Speaker 0: Now I recently watched the Lost Boys again.

215
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,540
Speaker 0: You know what it really holds up as a vampire movie.

216
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,025
Speaker 0: It's got Corey Haim Corey Feldman Kiefer Sutherland like.

217
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:05,173
Speaker 0: it's a great movie about vampires.

218
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:10,788
Speaker 0: before vampires were cool 80s movie and It's set in the 80s, right?

219
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:12,417
Speaker 0: But you know a lot of movies that are made in the 80s.

220
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,267
Speaker 0: They're not set in the 80s.

221
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:16,077
Speaker 0: They're just made in the 80s.

222
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,878
Speaker 1: So they lose all this 80s stuff, even though they weren't trying to set it in the 80s.

223
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:30,033
Speaker 1: Yeah, like they have that crappy synthy music and the montage Especially if it's try if they try to set it in the future, but they made it in the 80s There'll be stuff like key tars and shit like that.

224
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:34,755
Speaker 1: It'll look like You know, what's the name of the the teacher in ponies?

225
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:46,173
Speaker 0: Oh, Charlie yeah, I look like, you know Charlie's, uh, you know Charlie's high school that was more like early 90s Even so early to midnight that was that was that solos punky Brewster.

226
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:47,478
Speaker 1: even so right?

227
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:47,980
Speaker 1: It's like.

228
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,970
Speaker 1: You know it looked that they made in the 80s.

229
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,638
Speaker 1: the future looked like the future 80s.

230
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,478
Speaker 0: But you know that like that like there's movies that happen to have been made in the 80s.

231
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,919
Speaker 0: So they look like shit today.

232
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:06,305
Speaker 0: But then there are movies that even if they were made in the 80s or not They were set in the 80s, but they didn't have the meta Constructs of the 80s.

233
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,674
Speaker 0: like the music isn't shitty 80s synth.

234
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,139
Speaker 0: It's just music from the 80s.

235
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:12,630
Speaker 0: So the lost boys is like that.

236
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,040
Speaker 0: It's a great movie.

237
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,665
Speaker 0: You should watch it, but I digress.

238
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:23,251
Speaker 0: the opening montage of lost boys shows all the scary Weirdos on the boardwalk while it plays the cover of the doors.

239
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:27,205
Speaker 0: people are strange and it's just like yeah Look at that scary guy.

240
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:28,489
Speaker 0: He's wearing all black.

241
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,660
Speaker 0: Oh my god, that guy's got a mohawk and he's on a motorcycle.

242
00:16:31,882 --> 00:16:44,233
Speaker 0: Watch the fuck out And It seems like this guy from Ohio is afraid of that, but I see people like that every day Just like walking around in Midtown, and they're usually not scary at all.

243
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:54,939
Speaker 0: in fact people who dress the way People were afraid of scary people in the 80s like the people that 80s people were afraid of in the 80s are the nerds.

244
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,492
Speaker 0: today The guy with the mohawk is the gamer nerd.

245
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:00,219
Speaker 0: more often than not that's true.

246
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:06,031
Speaker 1: He's playing that dangerous Dungeons and Dragons, it's like this.

247
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:15,339
Speaker 0: guy just came here out of 1981 and passed a curfew and I have more to say because I you know curfews suck and there was a curfew.

248
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:23,821
Speaker 0: I ran away from the police at least every other night as a kid because of the fucking curfew and you know I just be out at night getting into trouble, but That's it.

249
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,347
Speaker 0: I just kind of ran it for a while.

250
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:27,635
Speaker 0: There's no news that I want to talk about yet.

251
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:37,370

Speaker 0: There's something about that style of meme of statement statement that has just never worn thin with me.

289
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:37,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is this many six pages of this stuff, so there's plenty for you to read back.

290
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:45,189
Speaker 0: There's only one meme of this style that I enjoy more than this particular one, and that is the haha guy haha.

291
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:51,073
Speaker 1: So I'm making fun of God's Inconsistency.

292
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:53,922
Speaker 0: my thing of the day here is just not.

293
00:19:54,002 --> 00:20:02,590
Speaker 0: it's a complaint, but I can't really justify Complaining because I do not willing to step up and do something better.

294
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:18,876
Speaker 0: but you know we're into the ponies as all men are and the only place you can really go to get your pony business is Either randomly searching YouTube which doesn't work Or going to equestria daily, which is 90% fanfiction.

295
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:22,069
Speaker 1: You can just ignore the fanfiction.

296
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,612
Speaker 1: you know that you can.

297
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:28,016
Speaker 1: you can look at all the other sections Individually yeah, and not look at the fanfiction, but it's not really a filter.

298
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:29,060
Speaker 0: It's more like a sin.

299
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,260
Speaker 0: It's just every pony thing and not all of it.

300
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,609
Speaker 1: Well is equestria daily not a crest here weekly?

301
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,400
Speaker 0: so they need something yeah, but College humor is daily, and you know what?

302
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,149
Speaker 0: Mostly gold or at least bronze.

303
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,640
Speaker 1: well cuz they got a lot more stuff coming in the filters.

304
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,433
Speaker 1: They could be more selective the pony stuff.

305
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:46,399
Speaker 1: That's pretty much all of it.

306
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,001
Speaker 0: Yeah But you've.

307
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:52,380
Speaker 0: the way to make a successful internet filter is to you have the slider like the line of how much do you let?

308
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,148
Speaker 0: Through you have to set it.

309
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,660
Speaker 1: problem with the question is they've already let so much through.

310
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,422
Speaker 1: It's like will you let?

311
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:04,748
Speaker 1: if they if they start being filtering more harshly before you know the the source material Quantity increases well.

312
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:06,619
Speaker 0: This is it will create drama.

313
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:15,996
Speaker 0: This is why someone needs to make the Ponyville Street Journal That is the like erudite version that only posts and has no fanfiction whatsoever.

314
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:20,938
Speaker 0: No fanfiction whatsoever Except comics which while technically fanfiction I?

315
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,962
Speaker 0: Think you agree.

316
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:27,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're fanfiction, but they're okay because they're short yeah, and they're drawn.

317
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:27,600
Speaker 0: yeah.

318
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,612
Speaker 0: There's a barrier to entry a higher barrier to entry.

319
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:35,858
Speaker 1: so because there's a lot Still deny comics that weren't funny, or we're poorly drawn yep.

320
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:44,300
Speaker 0: But because there is not a lot of great pony stuff and a lot of it's actually kind of hard to find My thing of the day is just a really awesome pony video notice.

321
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,715
Speaker 1: I've been laying off the ponies entirely in the podcast since the let.

322
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:48,820
Speaker 1: we actually had a pony episode.

323
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:50,052
Speaker 1: We him cannot hold back.

324
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:50,859
Speaker 1: He can't help himself.

325
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:54,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were talking about ponies for a while before the episode.

326
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:54,956
Speaker 1: I didn't.

327
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:55,960
Speaker 1: I just said not in the show.

328
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:59,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, not only restrained myself so much Oh my god.

329
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,076
Speaker 0: So yeah ponies ponies.

330
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:16,786
Speaker 0: And very briefly in the meta moment we will be this weekend at Saturday pretty much all day Or at least most of it at the mocha festival in New York starts at 11 a.m.. Yeah, whatever it starts We'll be there around that time.

331
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:20,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I plan to talk to pretty much everyone at every table.

332
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,200
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep, yep, I thought no more ponies no more ponies accidental pony accidental pony.

333
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,945
Speaker 0: You can't hold it in.

334
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:30,133
Speaker 1: stop make it stop extending it.

335
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:31,200
Speaker 0: wait a minute.

336
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:35,796
Speaker 0: I just noticed that because I'm looking at our con schedule because I was about to announce that.

337
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:37,322
Speaker 0: don't forget anime Boston.

338

339
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,174
Speaker 0: We will be at anime Boston doing a shit ton of panels.

340
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,440
Speaker 1: Are we really doing a shit ton?

341
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,238
Speaker 1: I thought we're only doing like four really like four.

342
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:51,076
Speaker 0: We've really cut down from our days of seven or eight panels at con.

343
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:51,820
Speaker 1: forget those days.

344
00:22:54,584 --> 00:23:00,271
Speaker 0: But I just noticed I think someone might have told us before and I forgot that There's a band playing Saturday night called stereo pony.

345
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:02,820
Speaker 1: I don't think that band acts has anything to do with my little pony.

346
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,907
Speaker 0: No, but it's nomen.

347
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,656
Speaker 1: some people are planning a brony meetup at Otakon.

348
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,924
Speaker 0: Oh We should.

349
00:23:11,145 --> 00:23:15,100
Speaker 0: uh we should be the ones who force the impromptu brony meetup at anime Boston.

350
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:16,748
Speaker 1: I'm sure there will be a brony meetup.

351
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:18,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, well has Daryl Surratt seen it?

352
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:19,100
Speaker 0: yet?

353
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:24,139
Speaker 0: I don't know cuz the last I heard he had not actually watched an episode yet.

354
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:27,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever if that is true I'll make him watch.

355
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:31,453
Speaker 0: anyway We will be at anime Boston doing panels like anime openers from around the world.

356
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,238
Speaker 0: and who is hot today?

357
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:37,230
Speaker 1: Miku Yep, high quality panels that have been rarely seen.

358
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've done anime openers.

359
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:40,800
Speaker 0: I think one at anime Boston.

360
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:43,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it was a way different panel.

361
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,040
Speaker 1: I did miko one Miku once at Kinetic Con.

362
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:58,258
Speaker 1: It was the best panel ever but there was hardly anyone in there because it was late at night and now it's gonna be the Awesomest panel you ever seen yep, and of course the book club book was Michio Kaku's hyperspace, which we're now gonna talk about.

363
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,952
Speaker 0: yep Are you gonna announce the next book?

364
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:02,060
Speaker 1: well actually?

365
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,315
Speaker 1: Actually, I had a book in mind my favoritest book of ever.

366
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:07,360
Speaker 0: yeah a little prince.

367
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:10,170
Speaker 1: No, that was my second favorite book ever.

368
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,357
Speaker 1: That's probably my third favorite book ever.

369
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,187
Speaker 1: Oh wow But anyway, I was gonna pick that book.

370
00:24:15,227 --> 00:24:18,879
Speaker 1: my Claire Bibble might now my favorite is book ever, but you know what I?

371
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:21,448
Speaker 1: Changed my mind like yesterday.

372
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:24,180
Speaker 1: god damn it, so I'm glad I didn't say anything.

373
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:25,589
Speaker 1: And you know why I changed my mind.

374
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:26,596
Speaker 0: you want to read something.

375
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:30,514
Speaker 1: You've never read That's right, and also because I read hyperspace, and it gave me an idea.

376
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:35,980
Speaker 0: well whatever it is You're gonna have to wait because a book I've been waiting for for a long time is gonna be delivered to my door any day.

377
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:36,580
Speaker 1: It's all right.

378
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,300
Speaker 1: We waited a long time to do hyperspace, and I think that was worthwhile.

379
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,931
Speaker 1: But hyperspace gave me the idea of the book that I should choose and then after that I will go and choose my favoritest book ever.

380
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:47,420
Speaker 0: so what brief history of the universe.

381
00:24:47,982 --> 00:24:48,986
Speaker 0: No, we're gonna read.

382
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:55,628
Speaker 1: you know we're gonna read fucking foundation bitches, that's right Foundation that's right foundation number one.

383
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:59,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I should actually read that bought all three on am?

384
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,487
Speaker 1: I see there's more than three, but I bought that.

385
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:03,695
Speaker 1: the read that the original three on Amazon.

386
00:25:03,716 --> 00:25:04,780
Speaker 0: That's all we're doing.

387
00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:06,447
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah one.

388
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:06,909
Speaker 1: We're not.

389
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,134
Speaker 1: we're not doing the all three.

390
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:09,199
Speaker 1: We're doing just the first one.

391
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,526
Speaker 1: yeah Otherwise we'll be here all night.

392
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:12,531
Speaker 0: It's about time.

393
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,058
Speaker 0: I actually did read foundation.

394
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:14,520
Speaker 1: That's right.

395
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:16,526
Speaker 0: As much as I know about it.

396
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,011
Speaker 0: I've never actually read it.

397
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:19,938
Speaker 1: I started to read it one time.

398
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,480
Speaker 1: I think my parents have like a hardcover.

399
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,239
Speaker 1: That's like a three in one, but I bought the three separate ones, so we're gonna read.

400
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:31,820
Speaker 1: We're just gonna read the first foundation and by Asimov, and that's it all right.

401
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,873
Speaker 1: So there you go done, and then next time it is my turn.

402
00:25:35,295 --> 00:25:36,400
Speaker 1: I'll read my favorite his book every.

403
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:49,640
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid this was a long time ago, and I didn't realize how long ago Was until I read hyperspace again, I read hyperspace a scientific Odyssey through parallel universes time warps and the 10th dimension.

404
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:52,665
Speaker 0: I don't even know Why I read hyperspace like.

405
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:58,446
Speaker 0: I don't know if someone gave it to me if I just found it in the bookstore like I can't I don't remember.

406
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:02,907
Speaker 0: all I know was that when I was really young Something like 1995 or 1996.

407
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:04,130
Speaker 1: well the book came out in like 93 94 94.

408
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:13,118
Speaker 0: I read it and it seemed really profound to me and I forgot about it.

409
00:26:13,562 --> 00:26:18,446
Speaker 0: And then you know I was kind of reminded of it recently cuz I read that Bryson book and a bunch of other books on science I was like oh hyperspace.

410
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,775
Speaker 0: I could read that again.

411
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:20,580
Speaker 0: I think it's a good book.

412
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:21,685
Speaker 0: We just did cosmos.

413
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:24,698
Speaker 0: it fits with my theme, and you know we'll see how it stands up.

414
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:30,839
Speaker 0: It amazes me how little I remembered from that book from reading it as a kid.

415
00:26:31,662 --> 00:26:38,200
Speaker 0: But at the same time it amazes me how much I realize now that hyperspace affected my worldview.

416
00:26:39,062 --> 00:26:39,503
Speaker 1: I'm reading

417
00:26:39,543 --> 00:27:09,892
Speaker 0: this book as a kid and thinking about the things I cared about as I got older and the things I was interested in and What I understood didn't understand and thought I understood, but didn't about particle physics And even like what I got into in high school like when I really started gravitating toward physics and away from biology and away from chemistry and toward math and the fact that I got really really really fucking into math toward the end of high school and actually Considered for a while going into math like as a career.

418
00:27:09,972 --> 00:27:13,964
Speaker 0: obviously that would have been maybe a mistake, but Definitely, I don't know.

419
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:19,230
Speaker 0: actually my co-workers a lot of them on the research side are trying to convince me to go back and get Like a master's in mathematics.

420
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:25,658
Speaker 0: Uh-huh sure I Would if I didn't have to pay for it if I had a full ride to go back to college and learn math.

421
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:28,932
Speaker 1: hell's Fuck yeah, math was great up until calculus.

422
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,860
Speaker 0: Ah calculus was my favorite thing.

423
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:32,953
Speaker 1: I do not like calculus see in high school.

424
00:27:32,993 --> 00:27:34,120
Speaker 0: We used to have calculus parties.

425
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,903
Speaker 0: We'd get together.

426
00:27:34,923 --> 00:27:36,368
Speaker 0: This is like when I was a senior.

427
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,211
Speaker 0: We'd watch The Simpsons.

428
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:39,720
Speaker 1: How many people at this party - like eight, okay?

429
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,792
Speaker 0: I mean look like my AP bio class was I don't know 12 people total.

430
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:44,776
Speaker 0: so anyway.

431
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:45,619
Speaker 1: Let's talk about this book.

432
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:50,951
Speaker 0: so hyperspace like I The analogies, I think that's where it really shows.

433
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:58,660
Speaker 0: like whenever up until I reread this book I you I would make an analogy for anything related to physics or time or space or math or anything.

434
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:06,019
Speaker 0: Almost all of those analogies I realized came out of hyperspace, and I just forgotten that that's where they came from.

435
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:15,159
Speaker 1: yeah I mean, I never read the book, but I've always also been an analogy person and when it comes to science I'm obviously weak very weak in the math department right, but I'm very strong.

436
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:17,960
Speaker 1: at least I think I'm very strong in the conceptual department.

437
00:28:18,561 --> 00:28:25,358
Speaker 0: So words that were said by one of my favorite physics teachers in high school were that and I quote as well.

438
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:31,013
Speaker 0: as I can remember Everybody likes the conceptual side of physics because you don't need to know fucking anything.

439
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:31,715
Speaker 1: That's right.

440
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:36,580
Speaker 0: That's exactly right Because I said the same thing to him.

441
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:38,130
Speaker 1: We even says so in this book.

442
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,580
Speaker 1: there's a part pretty close to the end.

443
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,655
Speaker 1: He's like look if you just want to describe you know conceptually what we've learned in physics.

444
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:46,140
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty simple, right?

445
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:46,562
Speaker 1: It's like.

446
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:54,338
Speaker 1: it's like you could say in a few sentences You know it's it's you know, but to actually describe why we know that and how we know that metric tensors.

447
00:28:54,459 --> 00:29:02,297
Speaker 1: Yeah But thing is even though this book talks about a lot of math it doesn't actually do any math right.

448
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:05,971
Speaker 1: he names Equations and he describes what you know he's like.

449
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:11,733
Speaker 1: so there's an equation called of this You know a metric tensor and a metric tensor means this.

450
00:29:11,753 --> 00:29:12,154
Speaker 0: well.

451
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:13,700
Speaker 0: He showed you like a matrix.

452
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,991
Speaker 0: He's like all right, and then he shows those boxes where he's like.

453
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:19,017
Speaker 0: here's where Einstein's theory fits in.

454
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:19,800
Speaker 0: here's this.

455
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,789
Speaker 0: You see them like growing out like when he does so.

456
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:23,114
Speaker 1: it's like I couldn't.

457
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:23,797
Speaker 1: you know.

458
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:36,976
Speaker 1: based on this I couldn't actually do any of this math, but obviously but if You so if you showed me an equation and said what the name of the equation was I'd be like oh That's the equation that does this thing right and you know it's like.

459
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:37,859
Speaker 1: I could match the.

460
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:49,402
Speaker 1: now I can match the conceptual ideas with the names of the mathematical equations and actually if I understood and knew how to read those Mathematical equations I could probably say oh, that's the one that matches up with that idea You know.

461
00:29:49,443 --> 00:29:58,777
Speaker 1: so it's like you can't think about the math directly But it gives you sort of this idea of You know which maths are used for what.

462
00:29:59,099 --> 00:29:59,220
Speaker 0: well?

463
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,400
Speaker 0: I think for as a kid though what this book did what is a cosmos is very different?

464
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,084
Speaker 0: But they both serve the same purpose.

465
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:10,959
Speaker 0: They're like hey you guys realize that science is actually the most awesome thing right?

466
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,600
Speaker 1: yeah It's very similar to cosmos a lot of ways because you know he talks about the history.

467
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:16,612
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's talking about all the old sigh.

468
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:27,589
Speaker 0: You know he does a lot of storytelling Like second style of getting people excited about science is more of a awe and like oh my god You know how many anythings there are anywhere.

469
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:28,954
Speaker 0: just think about that.

470
00:30:29,054 --> 00:30:30,720
Speaker 1: whoa he doesn't do a lot of that here.

471
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,527
Speaker 0: He'd know cock who does more this thing of?

472
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:35,212
Speaker 0: yeah fucking wormholes.

473
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:35,954
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

474
00:30:36,154 --> 00:30:37,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, they might be real.

475
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:38,280
Speaker 0: Oh, here's the math.

476
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:45,771
Speaker 1: Instead of being like you know trying to awe you with the wonders of the universe He does a lot more practical stuff like he's like.

477
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:47,438
Speaker 1: so what does this mean for you?

478
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:47,518
Speaker 1: Yep?

479
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:48,462
Speaker 1: You know.

480
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:50,369
Speaker 1: and oh this discovery.

481
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:51,312
Speaker 1: Well, what did that mean?

482
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:53,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm like all right the universe is gonna end.

483
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:54,764
Speaker 0: Can we do anything about that?

484
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:59,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, huh, and he actually poses like hey, maybe maybe we can.

485
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:03,879
Speaker 1: He's like there's a chance that we can do this and there's a chance that we can do that.

486
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,911
Speaker 1: You know he doesn't really you know have any definitive things cuz.

487
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:12,891
Speaker 1: well at the site then except for where the science is definitive Yeah, it's like he's directly in line with whatever the science says.

488
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:13,935
Speaker 1: you know he's like.

489
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:15,884
Speaker 1: could there be a God and as you read Through the book.

490
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:16,389
Speaker 1: It's like yes.

491
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:17,035
Speaker 1: Nope

492
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:17,560
Speaker 0: yes

493
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:27,697
Speaker 1: No, maybe yes, no, but oh, but then you know towards the end He's like well you can you can't have the God of miracles But you have the God of order, and it's like make

494
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:28,820
Speaker 0: up your mind Yep

495
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:38,015
Speaker 1: Because as you learn more sciences throughout the book the answers to the clay keeps asking the same questions again And you keeps answering them differently because you learned a new thing.

496
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:39,060
Speaker 1: so now the answer has changed.

497
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:44,040
Speaker 0: I do enjoy how he went through and I had with with like light as a particle in different different aspects.

498
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:55,537
Speaker 0: Well based on what everything we've talked about so far it seems like this is true the next chapter is basically yeah That's a bunch of horseshit, and here's why yeah, I mean you know he also does a lot of concentration on.

499
00:31:55,818 --> 00:32:00,210
Speaker 1: you know Theoretic the theoretical versus the experimental is like experimentally.

500
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:02,656
Speaker 1: standard model is the king right?

501
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:04,120
Speaker 1: There's just so much evidence.

502
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:04,984
Speaker 1: It's unbelievable.

503
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:09,146
Speaker 1: it always works, but it doesn't work 100%.

504
00:32:09,146 --> 00:32:10,339
Speaker 1: So we got to go to this.

505
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:18,479
Speaker 1: But we can't actually use the string theory because we would need the energy of a hajillion And we don't have that and we're not gonna have that for a long time.

506
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:21,311
Speaker 0: I also think about remember how when we're at our IT.

507
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:23,740
Speaker 0: We'd argue about physics or causality or whatever.

508
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:26,912
Speaker 0: I'd always be like yeah the Planck constant the Planck limit.

509
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:28,900
Speaker 0: That's because I read hyperspace as a kid.

510
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, Planck didn't come up that much in my physics classes.

511
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:32,631
Speaker 0: No.

512
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:34,075
Speaker 1: I still have.

513
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:34,456
Speaker 1: I still.

514
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:39,034
Speaker 1: that is one thing That I you know a lot of the things he describes in this book.

515
00:32:39,114 --> 00:32:43,931
Speaker 1: right I can have a much better Conceptual understanding of after reading it obviously like strings and such.

516
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:51,840
Speaker 1: yeah, but one thing I do have a better understanding of it But I still have a hard time understanding it right is the idea that there's these other dimensions.

517
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,080
Speaker 1: I understand that other dimensions.

518
00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:58,620
Speaker 1: I can't picture them in my brain, but I can I can you know understand more multiple spatial dimensions.

519
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:03,817
Speaker 1: But I still have a hard time thinking about is that the other spatial dimensions are collapsed.

520
00:33:04,078 --> 00:33:04,720
Speaker 1: It's like why?

521
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:15,287
Speaker 1: Okay, I understand Mathematically they're collapsed and I can understand that the fact that they are collapsed But I can't actually well It's picture why they're collapsed.

522
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:19,200
Speaker 1: like why can't they just be fully remember the part in cosmos?

523
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,959
Speaker 0: Where Sagan talks about the the fact that we don't know for sure if our universe is open or closed.

524
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:28,978
Speaker 0: mm-hmm a dimension can be the same thing.

525
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:42,830
Speaker 0: a Spherical dimension would be closed and that you can go infinitely in any direction Along the surface, but yet there is a finite amount of space But yet infinite space depending on how you look at it.

526
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:45,760
Speaker 0: that it's closed in on itself that there's like this discrete.

527
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:50,180
Speaker 1: So this is basically there's an edge whether but there is no edge, okay?

528
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:57,147
Speaker 0: So let me think about this there's no edge whether or not it's open or closed it either loops back on itself or goes off Or so it's either pac-man or its infinity.

529
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,216
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so so what you're?

530
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:10,679
Speaker 1: so the thing is Let's pretend that the third dimensions you have a cube right yeah What if the third dimension was collapsed resulting in two dimensions, but there's really three, but the third ones collapsed?

531
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,563
Speaker 1: What would that be like?

532
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,774
Speaker 1: because we can imagine that right same thing.

533
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:14,980
Speaker 1: so what would that be like though?

534
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,170
Speaker 1: Would it be like flat land, but you can go around the you can pac-man?

535
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,556
Speaker 1: yeah, right so.

536
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:20,659
Speaker 1: but then where's the third dimension?

537
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,929
Speaker 1: Is it just the cube got flattened, but but there is a cube is just a really short cube the way I I think.

538
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:31,300
Speaker 1: so there is an up and down But you can't actually go up and down because as soon as you go up you pac-man to the bottom.

539
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,578
Speaker 1: I mean think of this you can't really tell there's nothing down.

540
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:35,668
Speaker 0: the way I always envisioned is you know there is you can see me.

541
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:46,300
Speaker 0: I'm savo tendering right now, but for all you know I'm moving back and forth all over the place in this fourth dimension, but because it's so small I'm just looping back around and there's no way to detect that.

542
00:34:46,702 --> 00:34:48,409
Speaker 1: So there is a fourth dimension, but it's so.

543
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:51,100
Speaker 1: it's like if you squish a cube like a pancake right.

544
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,628
Speaker 1: So there is a third dimension.

545
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:56,737
Speaker 1: we can where even though we think we're in flat land We can actually jump up and down a little bit.

546
00:34:57,282 --> 00:35:05,997
Speaker 1: But because it's pac-man when you get to the top when you jump up and down It doesn't actually look like you're jumping up and down because you're hardly actually jumping because your head comes out the bottom.

547
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:11,644
Speaker 0: another complication I don't know if this is in hyperspace or not because I read it again Long time ago.

548
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:15,478
Speaker 0: it took a while for us to do this episode, but three to met.

549
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:20,920
Speaker 0: the third Three-dimensional physical space is the only place where a knot can exist.

550
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:22,331
Speaker 1: I know that's that's I want.

551
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:26,499
Speaker 1: he didn't give me the math for that But it made me reminded me that thing of the day you had a long time ago.

552
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:27,965
Speaker 1: What was that one?

553
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:29,610
Speaker 0: Oh the four-dimensional knots?

554
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:32,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever that would think that it was the thing of the day you had.

555
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,323
Speaker 1: It just reminded me of it.

556
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:33,925
Speaker 1: I don't know.

557
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:40,044
Speaker 1: I remember a four-dimensional game that no it was like he was like some like visualization of some.

558
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:48,743
Speaker 0: oh, it's the one where you have you take it this three-dimensional shape and Cross it over itself without Breaking it.

559
00:35:48,823 --> 00:35:49,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the one.

560
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:52,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, I'll try to find that that was amazing.

561
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:56,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway, there were you know, of course reading a book like this, right?

562
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,120
Speaker 1: Someone like me who doesn't know any math is gonna come up with crazy ideas, right?

563
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, I came up with two crazy ideas.

564
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:02,730
Speaker 1: I would like to discuss.

565
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:03,613
Speaker 0: All right.

566
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:05,942
Speaker 1: All right, so crazy idea number one You ready for this?

567
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:06,704
Speaker 1: I'm ready.

568
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:12,800
Speaker 1: So he at one point he talks about light actually being a vibration of the fourth dimension, right?

569
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, so is that true or not?

570
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:17,175
Speaker 1: Or is that just you know in progress kind of thing?

571
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,500
Speaker 0: Ah, it makes sense.

572
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:22,634
Speaker 1: Okay, so if we pretend that light is a vibration of the fourth dimension, right?

573
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:27,318
Speaker 1: Yes, that means Let's combine it with another idea that we understand very well.

574
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,660
Speaker 1: You're right Photosynthesis, so you got a plant Scott.

575
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,880
Speaker 0: There was just an article on slashdot not that long ago talking about quantum effects and how important they are to photosynthesis.

576
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,643
Speaker 0: They're really.

577
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:39,948
Speaker 1: I don't read that anymore.

578
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:44,939
Speaker 1: Well, maybe you should maybe I should because I was thinking wow There's a wave in the fourth dimension.

579
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:50,796
Speaker 1: Shake some molecules and atoms or whatever inside a plant and then the plant eats it.

580
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:52,280
Speaker 1: How crazy is that shit?

581
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,565
Speaker 1: So that is crazy.

582
00:36:53,705 --> 00:36:55,152
Speaker 0: Think about it even one step further.

583
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,700
Speaker 0: Imagine that we're in flatland, right?

584
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,371
Speaker 0: All right, and say that light or whatever in some other dimension.

585
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:03,200
Speaker 0: There's a sheet that's like a vibrating like waves.

586
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:10,729
Speaker 0: So say a wave like a bulb pops up through flatland momentarily Depending on at what point we observe.

587
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:11,754
Speaker 0: it say it's oscillating.

588
00:37:11,774 --> 00:37:12,940
Speaker 0: So it's a wave like a book.

589
00:37:13,142 --> 00:37:14,280
Speaker 1: So it appears and disappears.

590
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,380
Speaker 0: So it's a bubble going up and down up and down up and down intersecting with our universe at some point.

591
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:32,966
Speaker 0: Okay if the peak the absolute peak of that wave is the Exact point of our universe then it appears and it's a point an oscillating point that appears and disappears Infinitely and regularly.

592
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:35,134
Speaker 1: Okay, but it's if it's only a point.

593
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:38,072
Speaker 1: it's kind of hard to see though, but it's there All right, and we can interact with it.

594
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:38,978
Speaker 0: Maybe it messes stuff up.

595
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:44,500
Speaker 1: It might pop up like in just like the worst place in your brain or hurt if it's just a little bit taller.

596
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,497
Speaker 0: It's a circle now instead a sphere a circle that keeps appearing.

597
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:48,758
Speaker 0: it does.

598
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:49,260
Speaker 0: that's correct.

599
00:37:49,982 --> 00:37:51,086
Speaker 0: so think about that.

600
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:55,344
Speaker 0: in terms of electrons and the fact that they're not a point.

601
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:57,324
Speaker 0: they're a particle.

602
00:37:57,344 --> 00:37:57,887
Speaker 0: they're not either.

603
00:37:57,987 --> 00:38:01,103
Speaker 0: they're like a wave of probability that They're.

604
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:02,287
Speaker 0: we know they're like.

605
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:10,486
Speaker 0: this is the area where it could be and we know it's somewhere in there but we can't know where it is specifically and Maybe that has something to do with.

606
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:26,665
Speaker 0: imagine, you know that dimension something appearing in our universe Repeatedly in that manner that I described the bubble coming in through flatland Like the area where it's intersecting our universe is the probability wave but the actual structure of the electron.

607
00:38:26,686 --> 00:38:34,005
Speaker 0: the reason we can't really interact with it directly is because it is actually just of Oscillation on that other dimension.

608
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:34,688
Speaker 0: Hmm.

609
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:38,220
Speaker 0: It's not a thing but in our universe it manifests as a thing.

610
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:43,238
Speaker 0: Mmm, that would also explain why there are so many different particles.

611
00:38:43,258 --> 00:38:49,377
Speaker 1: Yeah So my second crazy idea isn't really chemo is like just knocking that hoof against his.

612
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:54,395
Speaker 1: I'm sure every every I'm sure every real physicist listening to us non-physicist is going crazy.

613
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:55,580
Speaker 1: And for that we apologize.

614
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:56,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, what if a computer?

615
00:38:56,524 --> 00:39:02,564
Speaker 1: but you should be glad that we are interested and we are not people who believe in Metaphysical or it's not?

616
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:04,972
Speaker 1: you want to do scientific things Scott and all.

617
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:12,295
Speaker 1: you are just curious and we know we are Unlearned and we do not believe the gods that are crazy you and all we just computer people can.

618
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:13,900
Speaker 0: now I'm going to do something.

619
00:39:14,524 --> 00:39:21,151
Speaker 0: I will use magic to let you experience Exactly what all the physicists listening to this episode are right now.

620
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:24,220
Speaker 0: All right, man, so computers use binary, right?

621
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,223
Speaker 0: It's just like zeros and ones.

622
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:28,032
Speaker 0: What if I had like a one two or five?

623
00:39:28,313 --> 00:39:30,380
Speaker 0: it'd be so much more powerful.

624
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:31,159
Speaker 1: We could do that.

625
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:41,160
Speaker 1: But in fact if they're physicists they will know that how a transistor works and a transistor is actually a quantum device Right, so they would know that you couldn't have a one two, three or five if they were physicists.

626
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:45,578
Speaker 1: But if they were normal people they would think you could have one two, three or five which you can actually do.

627
00:39:46,822 --> 00:39:50,560
Speaker 1: There have been computers that use their own one and they just kind of suck and they're hard to program.

628
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of reason.

629
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:54,133
Speaker 0: also are the way we do.

630
00:39:54,214 --> 00:39:59,913
Speaker 1: logic is not as easy or useful No, but anyway, here's my second crazy idea, which isn't really that crazy.

631
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:03,668
Speaker 1: It's actually just you know a Increased understanding right?

632
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:08,720
Speaker 1: So I always since it was explained to me originally I always sort of understood Einstein's gravity, right?

633
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,283
Speaker 1: You got a lot of.

634
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:10,270
Speaker 1: you got a lot of mass.

635
00:40:10,593 --> 00:40:20,920
Speaker 1: when you have a lot of mass You know, if you have a two-dimensional universe and you have a heavy thing It's gonna put a big dent in it, you know And that dent is actually a dent three a three-dimensional dent in the two-dimensional universe.

636
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:25,580
Speaker 1: So things seem to be falling into it Even though you can't see why they're falling into it because you're a two-dimensional person.

637
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:32,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, and likewise in three dimensions when there's a heavy thing right with a lot of mass It makes a big dent, but it's a four-dimensional dent.

638
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,720
Speaker 1: So things fall into it right and gravity, whatever.

639
00:40:36,743 --> 00:40:37,856
Speaker 1: But think about this, right?

640
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:46,320
Speaker 1: So Well, if there was a four-dimensional thing and it you know Let's say I was a four-dimensional person and I was not touching the third dimension and then I punched it, right?

641
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I put my fist into it.

642
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:48,428
Speaker 1: What's gonna happen?

643
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,820
Speaker 1: Well, they're gonna see three-dimensional people.

644
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:59,312
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say that it's not that you're putting your fist into the third dimension It's that there is a thing in the third dimension that you can.

645
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,436
Speaker 0: there's a three-dimensional thing.

646
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:06,905
Speaker 0: It's the equivalent of me I'm holding say this piece of paper is actually totally flat and there's things living on it That are effectively two-dimensional.

647
00:41:07,206 --> 00:41:08,049
Speaker 0: I just start fucking with them.

648
00:41:08,371 --> 00:41:16,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not putting my hand into the second dimension I'm just interacting with a four-dimensional object that happens to have also.

649
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:24,460
Speaker 1: you're saying that so we live in a third dimensional object That is floating in a fourth dimension and a lot of that fourth dimension isn't touching us only some of it is touching us.

650
00:41:24,722 --> 00:41:26,720
Speaker 0: I guess that's the best way we can say it anyway.

651
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:31,500
Speaker 1: But the point is if something from the fourth dimension were to enter our dimension, right?

652
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,040
Speaker 1: It would sort of appear out of a point and grow larger, right?

653
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,197
Speaker 1: It would be like if a basketball came in a four-dimensional basketball.

654
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:40,587
Speaker 1: So a Four-ball right would.

655
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,032
Speaker 1: they threw it at us right?

656
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:42,835
Speaker 1: They poked at us.

657
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:44,360
Speaker 1: We would see this a basketball.

658
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:45,439
Speaker 1: It would start out as like a dot.

659
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:58,932
Speaker 1: It would grow to a full basketball and then it would shrink again into another dot Right or something like that something along those lines, but isn't that what you know, like, you know The Sun looks like right, you know, it's got.

660
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:01,825
Speaker 1: you know, it's it gets bigger I get in.

661
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:03,318
Speaker 1: gravity makes it smaller, right?

662
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,864
Speaker 1: So it's like they.

663
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:10,000
Speaker 1: you know that that lends itself your gravity versus things from the fourth to met.

664
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:15,557
Speaker 1: You know things all matter being something from the fourth dimension protruding into the third dimension, right?

665
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:16,219
Speaker 0: Well, it's not.

666
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:20,009
Speaker 0: if Gravity is the distortion of space-time or something like that.

667
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:23,060
Speaker 0: Then it's just that's a dip in another dimension effectively

668
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:36,680
Speaker 1: No, but I'm saying is that it ever all if all matter is actually Something from the fourth dimension poking its way in Right, yeah, and then gravity is sort of it being sucked, you know back out to the fourth.

669
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:39,610
Speaker 0: well that's exactly what I guess it would be.

670
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:46,333
Speaker 0: and that if if all the individual particles are just the Manifestations of strings or waves or whatever in this multi-dimensional universe.

671
00:42:46,373 --> 00:42:57,299
Speaker 0: We can't really interact with then What we are is just kind of this meta structure that is manifest of all those other things That themselves are unrelated to their constituents.

672
00:42:58,481 --> 00:43:09,921
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was really struggling to have a sentence there but you see but that's the thing is you look at you look at You know a star and it's gravity and you look at the four-dimensional basketball just sort of passing by and it's the same sort of Thing.

673
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:12,230
Speaker 0: I know the trouble we have is looks the same.

674
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:17,562
Speaker 0: the trouble we have to watch out for is that we're definitely we can fall into the trap of the anthropic principle of We.

675
00:43:17,622 --> 00:43:22,100
Speaker 0: it's very easy for us to analogize things because they appear similar and they're complete bullshit in the math.

676
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:31,696
Speaker 1: It doesn't even match at all Of course Sagan because I was ran but you know Like a star going into a black hole looks the same with our eyeballs as a bat.

677
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,505
Speaker 1: a four-dimensional basketball Leaving our dimension.

678
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:35,528
Speaker 1: remember in cos.

679
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:36,912
Speaker 1: it shrinks to a point and goes away.

680
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:53,540
Speaker 0: when Sagan points out that if our universe is closed It's as though we are our entire universe is contained within or it is effectively an electron But one in a greater universe and that every point particle in our universe is in fact a closed universe.

681
00:43:53,902 --> 00:43:56,459
Speaker 0: That itself, you know, and it's ad infinitum up and down.

682
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:01,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't think that you know, you could fit a billion billion galaxies in in one of our electrons.

683
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,245
Speaker 1: That's that's not in there.

684
00:44:02,747 --> 00:44:03,168
Speaker 0: Why not?

685
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's not in there.

686
00:44:05,116 --> 00:44:05,578
Speaker 0: then how come?

687
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,080
Speaker 0: how do you know?

688
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,003
Speaker 0: We're not an electron.

689
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:12,040
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that our universe of a billion billion galaxies is not an electron.

690
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,945
Speaker 1: Maybe why not?

691
00:44:13,065 --> 00:44:13,789
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a proton.

692
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,719
Speaker 0: I don't think you listen to Carl Sagan that much.

693
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:19,205
Speaker 1: It's not it's not.

694
00:44:19,847 --> 00:44:21,334
Speaker 1: this isn't turtles all the way down.

695
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:27,414
Speaker 0: so I did ask Timo our Non-resident expert on these man.

696
00:44:27,454 --> 00:44:28,376
Speaker 1: What did you ask him?

697
00:44:28,396 --> 00:44:30,820
Speaker 0: I was like, yeah, so I really know hyperspace.

698
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:38,200
Speaker 0: I was talking a little bit and I gave me permission to read this But he gave a short like mini review of his feelings in the hyperspace.

699
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,545
Speaker 0: My question was here.

700
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:41,551
Speaker 0: Let me find the exact question that I asked him.

701
00:44:41,572 --> 00:44:45,926
Speaker 0: doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo I can't find it.

702
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:47,953
Speaker 0: I was basically like hey you have the answer.

703
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:52,406
Speaker 1: You know the question is hyperspace legit Did anything?

704
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:54,133
Speaker 1: that is something I do want to comment on.

705
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:55,700
Speaker 1: oh actually two things I want to comment on.

706
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:07,560
Speaker 1: So one thing if you were not someone who understood science and math, you know, I mean and you read this book Just from the look like if you were not an educated person like if you were, you know, very uneducated.

707
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:08,665
Speaker 0: Oh, it's rock-solid.

708
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:11,236
Speaker 1: No, no, but this book even though it is rock-solid.

709
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:11,818
Speaker 1: I agree, right?

710
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,140
Speaker 1: The way it presents itself physically and with diagrams and lit, you know in its wording, right?

711
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:25,757
Speaker 1: Easily and On a surface level very much resembles pretty much any time cube.

712
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:26,340
Speaker 1: Randy book.

713
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:34,409
Speaker 1: You know, you actually you have to have some sort of beginning knowledge or intelligence To be able to tell the difference between this.

714
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:35,412
Speaker 0: you want to know why.

715
00:45:35,754 --> 00:45:36,376
Speaker 0: you want to know why.

716
00:45:36,396 --> 00:45:37,720
Speaker 0: two dimensional?

717
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:50,338
Speaker 0: Simple drawings that illustrate very powerful analogies that directly relate to feelings people have look at the fourth way I know exactly so, you know, it's like What's what really does?

718
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,126
Speaker 1: Separate this from time cube.

719
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:55,159
Speaker 1: besides the fact that the math is right and as opposed to the math is not made up.

720
00:45:55,179 --> 00:46:00,860
Speaker 1: and if you're Not an expert who can tell you you whatever book you read first time cube or hyperspace is gonna get you know How?

721
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:03,610
Speaker 0: you you know how you solve that if I read time cube?

722
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,713
Speaker 0: Alright time cube.

723
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:07,908
Speaker 0: I read a different book That isn't time cube.

724
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:08,934
Speaker 0: They don't match up.

725
00:46:09,317 --> 00:46:09,739
Speaker 1: That's true.

726
00:46:10,161 --> 00:46:14,544
Speaker 0: If I read hyperspace and then some other quantum physics book, they're gonna match up quite a bit They are.

727
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:18,728
Speaker 1: and as for the up-to-date ness, you know I was also thinking about that because this book is from 94.

728
00:46:18,728 --> 00:46:20,092
Speaker 1: Yeah there it's.

729
00:46:20,273 --> 00:46:22,300
Speaker 1: it's at least a lot of years later.

730
00:46:23,202 --> 00:46:25,460
Speaker 1: Right, there had to be some development since then.

731
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,689
Speaker 1: So there are things in this book that are out of date.

732
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:30,640
Speaker 1: For example, he talks about the superconducting supercollider.

733
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,895
Speaker 1: We already know that we now have the hadron collider, right?

734
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:36,400
Speaker 1: He didn't know about that when he wrote the book.

735
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:39,636
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we haven't found anything huge there yet.

736
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:39,978
Speaker 1: Yeah.

737
00:46:40,118 --> 00:46:44,529
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway so that sort of thing is out of date.

738
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:52,217
Speaker 1: but I thought about the out-of-date ness of this book when I was reading it and I was like 20 years whatever but reading the book most of the time.

739
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,080
Speaker 1: what's he talking about?

740
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:59,740
Speaker 1: He's talking about people like von Neumann or Riemann or Einstein or even Newton, right?

741
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,378
Speaker 1: It's like those guys are centuries old.

742
00:47:03,438 --> 00:47:06,239
Speaker 0: Scott Who does Sagan talk about?

743
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:08,288
Speaker 1: Ancient Greek, right?

744
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:15,343
Speaker 1: So he's talking about these old old Scientists, right and even a lot of the ones, you know Even the more recent ones.

745
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:20,560
Speaker 1: he talks about our 20th early 20th century guys and their shit still holds up.

746
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,383
Speaker 1: You know, he's got like he'll.

747
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,975
Speaker 1: you look at the matrix he's got and whose names are in there?

748
00:47:24,035 --> 00:47:25,100
Speaker 1: Maxwell and Einstein.

749
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:27,763
Speaker 1: Those are not recent, dude right, I mean.

750
00:47:28,124 --> 00:47:47,416
Speaker 1: so if there was something, you know, and if their stuff is still legit after centuries then In the 20-something years since this book has been written You're I don't think you know the odds of there being something devastatingly Huge that changes this book completely and makes it invalid are pretty low.

751
00:47:47,537 --> 00:47:51,380
Speaker 1: if centuries Couldn't have invalidated these other guys, right?

752
00:47:51,741 --> 00:48:00,897
Speaker 1: If their stuff is still right Then the stuff in this book is still gonna be mostly right and right enough for a layman like myself Who's never going to do any sort of?

753
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:02,969
Speaker 1: Scientific experiment in this department.

754
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,060
Speaker 0: one thing that's really cool is that look at cosmos.

755
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:09,939
Speaker 0: I was reading through all the errata like all the updates since cosmos came out.

756
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,076
Speaker 0: Very few corrections very few outright.

757
00:48:15,096 --> 00:48:15,940
Speaker 0: This was wrong.

758
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:23,120
Speaker 0: Mostly it's we confirmed this even more or we confirm something even crazier than we suspected.

759
00:48:23,481 --> 00:48:26,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, or you know, this science is happening things like that.

760
00:48:26,715 --> 00:48:27,800
Speaker 1: It was there was some article.

761
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,453
Speaker 1: I don't remember what it was, but I read it.

762
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:48,260
Speaker 1: I think yesterday I don't even I just read it really quickly I'd even bother but it was about a very similar hyperspace related topic on a real science blog and a lot of the stuff that was written in that post was like Totally just straight from this book and I was like I understood half that blog post because it was just out of this book.

763
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:59,140
Speaker 1: So if it hasn't changed since a blog post from yesterday, I think this book is still Incredibly valuable to someone who wants to learn about this and is not yet so out of date.

764
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:00,420
Speaker 1: It's not no longer worth reading.

765
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:07,820
Speaker 0: So from Timo who is a physicist who actually does know what he's talking about, you know 10 billion times more than we do I read hyperspace over the weekend.

766
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,818
Speaker 0: Here's the short of it too many boring anecdotes and strained analogies, but I like anecdotes and analogies, especially strained one.

767
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:17,686
Speaker 0: Yes Longer, here's the long of it.

768
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:25,320
Speaker 0: I am tempted to say that there are too many overly generalized explanations But in hindsight, I say that he doesn't actually explain anything.

769
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:29,094
Speaker 0: The book is basically a dog and pony show.

770
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:38,280
Speaker 0: Yep of neat ideas Yep, and that it doesn't fail completely Although there are parts where I get an interesting insight into his thoughts on some meaningful physical concepts.

771
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:40,490
Speaker 0: There are few and far between hmm.

772
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:45,591
Speaker 0: The book is scientifically sound Though mostly old news.

773
00:49:45,973 --> 00:49:50,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, well dots is 94 it's old news there has especially for someone who's a profession.

774
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,206
Speaker 0: This is the part I want I get to learn more about.

775
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:56,404
Speaker 0: there has been a second revolution in string theory in the early 2000s.

776
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:57,510
Speaker 1: Oh, so that is that is the thing.

777
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,040
Speaker 1: That is pretty the only thing that's not in this book.

778
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:10,609
Speaker 0: probably also over the last decade Cosmology has become a precision science and added a lot of new opportunities for testing some of the ideas in the latter part of the Book that I'm really excited about.

779
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:11,835
Speaker 1: I want to learn about that.

780
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:17,291
Speaker 0: 17 years Even for the glacial pace that science advances.

781
00:50:17,311 --> 00:50:19,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, see glacial pace of science.

782
00:50:19,338 --> 00:50:23,480
Speaker 0: all in all It's not a bad popular science book, but I'm a scientist.

783
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:28,800
Speaker 0: So I see all the ifs and buts no kidding and I want more meat on my explanation.

784
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:33,519
Speaker 1: Of course if this if there's a computer science book that was written like this It would have no little to no value for me.

785
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,217
Speaker 0: the thing is this is a book to where you could throw this at almost anyone and they can.

786
00:50:38,237 --> 00:50:45,164
Speaker 1: you could throw it at a Nerdy middle school student or a non fit or a beep or higher High school student.

787
00:50:45,224 --> 00:50:47,572
Speaker 0: I think that the best person to give this a

788
00:50:47,613 --> 00:50:48,556
Speaker 1: good high school is

789
00:50:48,636 --> 00:50:51,310
Speaker 0: someone who's a little nerdy Who but like

790
00:50:51,472 --> 00:51:04,274
Speaker 1: early on in there I think it's best if there's a kid who's starting to show who actually shows interest in science like if they're in science class at all and they go ooh, or if they watch Discovery Channel and they're like, oh And they go all even once you gotta give this book.

791
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:07,294
Speaker 1: Yep, or Cosmos or any of those similar books.

792
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:11,775
Speaker 0: Yes But it's I think middle school is the age because that you know.

793
00:51:11,895 --> 00:51:13,160
Speaker 0: end of middle school early high school.

794
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,659
Speaker 1: It's like they'll get some of it, but they won't understand a lot of it as well.

795
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:19,620
Speaker 0: And if they're like me, it'll influence them in surprising way.

796
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,474
Speaker 1: I mean, I still can't even really understand how that dimension collapses.

797
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:26,340
Speaker 0: besides pac-man Yeah, and I can talk out my ass for hours.

798
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,480
Speaker 1: So in a third is in a three is actually in a three-dimensional space.

799
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,518
Speaker 1: But the third dimension collapse actually pac-man because he can go.

800
00:51:34,061 --> 00:51:35,086
Speaker 0: Depends depends on the map.

801
00:51:35,187 --> 00:51:40,472
Speaker 0: Can you just call it the sides of the top didn't go at the sides and the top Okay, so come up with a shape that works.

802
00:51:40,492 --> 00:51:42,039
Speaker 0: You've got a shape that crosses over itself.

803
00:51:42,743 --> 00:51:43,345
Speaker 1: Oh, didn't he say?

804
00:51:43,365 --> 00:51:48,498
Speaker 1: there was one point where he said it was like pac-man's on a cylinder or no He's on a Taurus, right?

805
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:51,294
Speaker 1: Yes But it's like how can pac-man be on a Taurus?

806
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:57,275
Speaker 1: I don't know whatever But if he's on a Taurus then it's three-dimensional but but it's a collapsed Taurus.

807
00:51:57,736 --> 00:51:58,659
Speaker 1: I don't I still don't get it.

808
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,752
Speaker 0: That's why we need a book with more meat on it now.

809
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:02,000
Speaker 0: I think we've gotten past this point.

810
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,900
Speaker 1: I want to see a picture of a three-dimensional universe where the third where the third dimension collapsed.

811
00:52:07,322 --> 00:52:08,105
Speaker 0: I guess it's only.

812
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:14,029
Speaker 0: I'm glad I read this book when I was much younger because I think there are better books for someone Of my age to read on these topics.

813
00:52:14,471 --> 00:52:16,440
Speaker 0: I think I could do for a little more math.

814
00:52:17,403 --> 00:52:23,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could you know, I could Like the math is unimportant, but let's move on.

815
00:52:24,134 --> 00:52:25,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, the math is just kind of hard.

816
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:30,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would least like more of the grounding of the math like more of the.

817
00:52:30,137 --> 00:52:33,997
Speaker 0: alright Here's what this implies Mathematically and here's why it implies that.

818
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:45,560
Speaker 1: yeah The only thing that I sort of question and obviously I'm almost I'm actually I'm 100% sure I'm wrong Right is that you know, he keeps showing you the matrix of like Einstein in the top left then Maxwell then Yang Mills, right?

819
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,739
Speaker 1: It's like now we have enough room.

820
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:58,439
Speaker 1: It's like adding more dimensions increase the size of the matrix Which means you have more room to fit stuff in there Which means you could add these, you know Now we can add all these guys in and everything fits together, right and I understood that conceptually very well.

821
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:00,640
Speaker 0: But it's like in taking stuff, right?

822
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,405
Speaker 0: But it's like and other people.

823
00:53:02,425 --> 00:53:11,360
Speaker 1: but at the same time I was thinking obviously wrong and mathematically right obviously, but it's like Couldn't I just make any matrix bigger and fit in any kind of maths?

824
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,656
Speaker 1: I wanted I could make a giant matrix and fit all the math in the world and it wouldn't.

825
00:53:14,696 --> 00:53:15,400
Speaker 1: it would totally work.

826
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:16,825
Speaker 1: So what is so?

827
00:53:16,845 --> 00:53:18,069
Speaker 1: what does that even mean?

828
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:18,370
Speaker 1: Right?

829
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:19,394
Speaker 0: I guess the that was.

830
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:21,020
Speaker 1: that was my stupid and incorrect thinking.

831
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:25,627
Speaker 1: Well, I guess my way around that is it's like yeah I can take two completely unrelated things.

832
00:53:25,928 --> 00:53:28,999
Speaker 1: make a big enough matrix so that there's enough spots in there to put both of them.

833
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,691
Speaker 1: But if you but if you make that does that make them related?

834
00:53:32,153 --> 00:53:36,653
Speaker 0: if you make it too much bigger Like bigger than it needs to be there's this extra space in there.

835
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:38,179
Speaker 0: You don't have anything to put in that space.

836
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:40,995
Speaker 0: So there's a hole that you can't fill.

837
00:53:41,015 --> 00:53:45,180
Speaker 1: that's meaning Well, there are some little holes that he said they do put something in there.

838
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,899
Speaker 1: But he said yeah, we're not gonna talk about what they put in that corner bit.

839
00:53:49,801 --> 00:54:02,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, I about three times reading this book again I went to Wikipedia and tried to learn more about metric tensors and I even asked some of the mathematicians at work and one of them I was like so I'm interested in metric tensors.

840
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:11,640
Speaker 0: and he looked at me and he said really and I said Yes And he said why reading some kaku?

841
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,193
Speaker 0: So We've got our new book.

842
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:20,980
Speaker 0: we had our old book.

843
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:31,961
Speaker 0: I think it's a worthwhile read especially if you've got like a nerdy Cousin who's younger than you or something or like a nerdy nephew or niece and you need a book to give them like a science Book.

844
00:54:32,182 --> 00:54:33,066
Speaker 0: that'll get them thinking.

845
00:54:33,086 --> 00:54:35,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, also it's like I delayed starting of reading it.

846
00:54:36,081 --> 00:54:37,993
Speaker 1: You know by a lot of time just cuz mostly cuz.

847
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:38,960
Speaker 1: I was busy with other things.

848
00:54:39,221 --> 00:54:48,040
Speaker 1: But once I started reading it, I not only did I have to finish it quickly to be in time for this episode I finished it yesterday last night, but I really wanted to finish it very quickly.

849
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:50,160
Speaker 1: Yes, you kept wanting to read more.

850
00:54:50,301 --> 00:54:55,810
Speaker 0: I dragged through the first and that's kind of a good book because I remembered it pretty well But then after that it was like, oh, whoa.

851
00:54:55,851 --> 00:54:56,635
Speaker 0: Wait, what what?

852
00:54:57,118 --> 00:55:08,080
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, so it's once you you know It's the kind of thing where it's like you won't want to start reading it because it's nonfiction and it's kind of like how no One wants to play a goddamn wooden cube game until I play it.

853
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,040
Speaker 1: Then once you start reading it, you're not gonna stop just like my little phone.

854
00:55:17,053 --> 00:55:19,590
