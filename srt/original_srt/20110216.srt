1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,631
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Wednesday, February 16th.

2
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:11,313
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:16,900
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight the 90s OAV my hope sky tie.

4
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:23,007
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:27,284
Speaker 1: So get this.

6
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:31,540
Speaker 1: I was poking around on the internet and there was an article on FARC about blockbuster of all things.

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,945
Speaker 0: I thought blockbuster was out of business.

8
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:37,400
Speaker 1: There are still apparently blockbuster stores in a few places that aren't gone yet.

9
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:39,760
Speaker 0: What is the towns like only old people?

10
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,188
Speaker 0: Apparently are they towns where they don't.

11
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,816
Speaker 0: not only they they only have dial-up internet.

12
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,906
Speaker 0: So no one get Netflix and Everyone's old.

13
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,294
Speaker 0: so they don't know how to use.

14
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:49,979
Speaker 0: you know.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,880
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing and they don't have one of those red boxes at the grocery store.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,294
Speaker 1: Blockbuster was completely irrelevant.

17
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:58,003
Speaker 1: that the brick-and-mortar Blockbuster.

18
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:01,800
Speaker 1: well, I'm not provide anything that I couldn't just get online from Netflix.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,599
Speaker 0: I thought the red but the red box at the grocery store put it out.

20
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:06,879
Speaker 1: Actually, the red boxes are doing really shittily now, too.

21
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,267
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but I mean they they were.

22
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:11,707
Speaker 0: it's sort of like it was the combination of the red box and then Yeah, I agree.

23
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:18,862
Speaker 1: until it put it out this FARC article I was convinced like you that there is no purpose left in the world for a brick-and-mortar Blockbuster.

24
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:28,098
Speaker 0: wait, let me guess which all of the extra stock from every other blockbuster that went out of business all went to this One blockbuster which is now a paradise of cheap DVDs and video games for a penny.

25
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:28,700
Speaker 1: Not quite.

26
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:39,169
Speaker 1: This was sad to me a little bit because as a kid I mean blockbuster is the only place that in Suncoast I could either go to Suncoast and buy my anime for like a $40 VHS with two episodes at a time.

27
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:42,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, or I could go to Blockbuster and watch like dune megalopolis.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had FYE Sam Goody in blockbuster.

29
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:49,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no apparently, you know, you can just download movies over the internet.

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,849
Speaker 1: But you know, you can't download right cash.

31
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,582
Speaker 1: someone fucking robbed one of the last blockbusters Okay.

32
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:59,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess there's still a purpose for the brick-and-mortar blockbuster.

33
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:00,905
Speaker 0: You know what?

34
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:03,100
Speaker 0: You can't rob Netflix or Amazon.

35
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:04,943
Speaker 0: That's actually.

36
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:05,907
Speaker 0: that's actually like.

37
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,979
Speaker 0: I'll bet you could rob an Amazon warehouse.

38
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,556
Speaker 0: It would be very difficult.

39
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,584
Speaker 0: the thing I don't think it would.

40
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:19,240
Speaker 0: that actually, you know, you think about it, right and you're like, okay How does Amazon make so much more, you know, how can they charge so much less than Best Buy, right?

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,880
Speaker 0: It's like well, they don't have the cost of the store and the sales people and all that.

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,599
Speaker 0: But they do have other costs like servers and these sorts of things, right?

43
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:35,216
Speaker 0: but a significant cost to Best Buy's and other retail stores is basically Insurance and also like basically, you know stop-loss, which is shoplifting.

44
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,280
Speaker 0: it cost them a lot of money.

45
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,418
Speaker 0: Amazon has zero shoplifting compared to pretty much any percentage.

46
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,500
Speaker 0: actually They save a ton of money on that.

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:42,901
Speaker 1: How do you know?

48
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:46,131
Speaker 1: because most loss is actually employees and not customers.

49
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,840
Speaker 1: and there are people who work in the Amazon warehouses.

50
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:50,849
Speaker 1: You don't you can't tell me I don't.

51
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:53,160
Speaker 1: there aren't people just taking boxes of shit out of there.

52
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:57,620
Speaker 0: I don't think people are walking out of the Amazon warehouse with a bike with tons of shit.

53
00:02:58,122 --> 00:02:59,568
Speaker 1: I would I'd be interested actually.

54
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:00,291
Speaker 1: I'm a shareholder.

55
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,240
Speaker 1: I should email and be like, what are your loss statistics?

56
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,247
Speaker 1: I really want to know.

57
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:04,335
Speaker 0: you can get the annual report.

58
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:04,900
Speaker 0: if it's public.

59
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's probably in.

60
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:07,153
Speaker 0: it might not be in.

61
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:08,240
Speaker 0: there might be find out.

62
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,005
Speaker 1: I've only.

63
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,058
Speaker 0: I'll be very interested to see about.

64
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,578
Speaker 0: you know The theft if there is any from Amazon and any other internet there's gotta be.

65
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:19,580
Speaker 0: I mean, there's some retailers that are also brick-and-mortar stores, right?

66
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:27,125
Speaker 0: Like Midtown Comics will sell you comics online, but you can also go to the store and I'm sure people steal from Midtown Comics You know, at least sometimes.

67
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:29,893
Speaker 0: no, I don't know I don't like shoplifting.

68
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:31,959
Speaker 0: that's real stealing it's not okay.

69
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,154
Speaker 0: So this would normally be like a Tuesday news because it's gaming related.

70
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:38,530
Speaker 1: You got nothing to say about anime Do you know?

71
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:39,400
Speaker 0: but it's Pokemon?

72
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,503
Speaker 0: So it is.

73
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:44,337
Speaker 0: I think the anime crowd the Wednesday listeners care more than the Tuesday listener.

74
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:44,919
Speaker 0: They may.

75
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:48,191
Speaker 0: So basically, you know the Pokemon card game.

76
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:49,476
Speaker 1: I know of it.

77
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:54,800
Speaker 0: I've played it on occasion All right, so they're gonna make a thing at the Pokemon website website pickups.

78
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:58,180
Speaker 0: That's an official game, right?

79
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:09,148
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a flash game where you can play the Pokemon card game in flash, right and there's three Pre-made decks that you can use.

80
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:13,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, three pre-constructed decks and twelve virtual trainers.

81
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:16,178
Speaker 0: You can play against across three leagues.

82
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:22,478
Speaker 0: so basically you can go learn how to play the game without spending any money and play it a whole bunch.

83
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,480
Speaker 0: and What I find, you know, I mean that's not the greatest thing in the world.

84
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,340
Speaker 0: It's not like you can use any card in the world and make any deck and play against any of your friends.

85
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
Speaker 1: But I can't say I did enjoy playing a little bit the magic on the Xbox.

86
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,989
Speaker 0: I was gonna say the magic on the Xbox.

87
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:38,880
Speaker 0: right they try to charge you money for that shit, right?

88
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,560
Speaker 0: But this is free flash in the browser and is basically to the same extent as the magic at the gathering on the X.

89
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:50,080
Speaker 1: Why is Nintendo so smart about some things and so dumb about very similar thing?

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,164
Speaker 0: Well, I think they're all.

91
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:57,412
Speaker 0: you know, this is like they're smarter than Wizards of the Coast in this particular department But they're not maximum smart.

92
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:01,009
Speaker 0: if they were maximum smart They would say one dollar a month.

93
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,700
Speaker 0: you get a program or five bucks a month.

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,244
Speaker 0: Even you get a program.

95
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:10,380
Speaker 0: you can play the Pokemon card game online against anyone with any card.

96
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:14,929
Speaker 1: No a much better Forever would be five dollars a month to maintain it.

97
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,080
Speaker 1: and then you know, you get access to all the basic cards.

98
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,300
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you get everyone gets one set, but you have to pay 20 bucks to add a new set of cards.

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,499
Speaker 0: But once you add the new set you can have any card in that set as you could probably get away With forcing them to buy boosters.

100
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,631
Speaker 0: You people do have done that online.

101
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:34,320
Speaker 0: the way you do it our games that do it.

102
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,567
Speaker 1: I know the way you do a Pokemon is you sell Physical boosters.

103
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:46,800
Speaker 1: that are the only way you so if you buy a physical booster It has a serial number that gives you a one-shot that gives you an in-game booster and or you can buy an online only booster.

104
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:49,222
Speaker 1: That's like three dollars cheaper Maybe.

105
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,127
Speaker 1: but that's what I would do.

106
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:56,295
Speaker 0: I mean that's if you want to those kids for everything They're were that would let you milk some kids who were way into it.

107
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:57,260
Speaker 0: really hard, right?

108
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,780
Speaker 1: But usually milking kids put you in a federal prison.

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,107
Speaker 0: But I'm just saying right is if you look at say the way the comic book people do it Right is they'll be like, okay.

110
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:09,360
Speaker 0: We got a new event, you know, it's the crazy war.

111
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,920
Speaker 0: So they'll have crazy war issues 1 through 12 and have crazy war side story and spider-man crazy war and Batman crazy war issues.

112
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:17,025
Speaker 0: Right, and they just went.

113
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,411
Speaker 0: so many issues a crazy war.

114
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:20,560
Speaker 0: the super collecting nerds have to buy them all right.

115
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:25,536
Speaker 0: But I think if you know, no one is willing everyone dips in the toe, right?

116
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:26,800
Speaker 0: No one jumps in the pool.

117
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:32,719
Speaker 0: I think if you made it, you know full-on like Netflix you get infinity cards for.

118
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:40,960
Speaker 0: you know These set prices instead of making people do the collecting thing that enough Extra people would be willing to buy in when the collecting I don't know.

119
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,135
Speaker 0: So it's not there that you would actually make more money.

120
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:43,860
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

121
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,168
Speaker 1: I think they should go one step further.

122
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:46,819
Speaker 0: you get my money if you did it that way.

123
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:51,771
Speaker 1: No, if they just want to make money why aren't you even thinking about a good game?

124
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:55,823
Speaker 1: just make a Pokemon skin Farmville Pokeville, that's it.

125
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:58,592
Speaker 1: That'll make more money than any effort.

126
00:06:58,673 --> 00:06:59,535
Speaker 1: any bullshit.

127
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:01,000
Speaker 0: Just throw it out there.

128
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:01,866
Speaker 0: But this is pretty.

129
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:03,940
Speaker 1: it's Farmville, but it's a little Pokemon icon.

130
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:09,594
Speaker 1: You make a little Poke Center and then you you know You put the Pokemon art in the fields and you don't even have to skin it.

131
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,100
Speaker 1: Don't even make the rules different.

132
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,599
Speaker 0: Why don't they do that?

133
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:13,337
Speaker 1: I don't know.

134
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:20,167
Speaker 0: But they could do that and they could also do this and those two things would not conflict with each other and they would Make even more money.

135
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:21,959
Speaker 1: or they could just make the Pokemon MMO.

136
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:28,997
Speaker 0: They could do all three of those things the card game the Farmville and the MMO and none of them would conflict with each other And they would all make maximum money.

137
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,629
Speaker 1: So further all the outside things are ways to get items that are Of course, they were all.

138
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,340
Speaker 0: all three of those things would cross over.

139
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:44,737
Speaker 0: So in the Pokemon MMO you would find cards you could use to play the card game And if you win the card game against someone you get points you can use to upgrade your Farmville.

140
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,615
Speaker 0: and in your Farmville You would grow items and those items would be used in the MMO.

141
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:54,283
Speaker 0: I Just pictured a kid growing and since you can only play each game on a little bit each day So you can.

142
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:55,350
Speaker 0: now you've got enough games.

143
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,879
Speaker 0: You can occupy your entire living time with spare time with Pokemon games.

144
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:04,079
Speaker 0: so anyway, and then you can cross it over with the actual GBA game.

145
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:12,137
Speaker 1: and Okay, it's interesting to me and kind of sad that you know We see pretty much every anime movie that comes out in theaters in New York.

146
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:21,760
Speaker 1: because every good one Yeah, everyone that isn't one piece number 100 But even then it's there aren't that many anime movies let alone anime movies that actually are in the u.s.

147
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,842
Speaker 0: Well, there are a whole bunch but they're all like I said one piece number 35,000.

148
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:31,292
Speaker 1: yeah, there aren't even that many of those 10. yeah, that's not that man.

149
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:32,034
Speaker 0: That's a line.

150
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,100
Speaker 0: They come out with one every year.

151
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,753
Speaker 0: They come with a Pokemon movie every year they come at right.

152
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:37,200
Speaker 0: So this is quite a few of them.

153
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,431
Speaker 1: I considered watching Pokemon forever the other day.

154
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:42,076
Speaker 0: So I guess that was number four.

155
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:44,184
Speaker 0: I Guess we saw.

156
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:46,820
Speaker 0: anyone we saw was number three the best way to see anime.

157
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,525
Speaker 1: It said that it's during this.

158
00:08:48,585 --> 00:08:53,480
Speaker 1: but the New York International Children's Film Festival, which is an awesome event in and of itself.

159
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,099
Speaker 1: It's just this great kind of film festival in New York, and there's no reason not to go.

160
00:08:57,722 --> 00:09:08,040
Speaker 1: but they always show pretty much every current big anime movie and The crowd at the anime movies at these things is half kids and half people like me and Scott.

161
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:09,631
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the same posse.

162
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:11,000
Speaker 0: It's actually a pretty good crowd though.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,549
Speaker 1: I remember we saw summer wars that way.

164
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,520
Speaker 0: summer wars is on DVD blu-ray.

165
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,977
Speaker 1: I think today we got that great Q&A at the end when all the questions were why is King Cosmo so awesome?

166
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:22,808
Speaker 1: is King Cosmo Your favorite character when I grow up?

167
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,531
Speaker 1: who's your favorite?

168
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,620
Speaker 0: I was like, who's your favorite character grandma?

169
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:29,425
Speaker 0: Was I supposed to say So?

170
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:33,919
Speaker 1: this year the International Children's Film Festival has two anime movies in addition to everything else.

171
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:35,950
Speaker 1: We got tell welcome to the space show.

172
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,700
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and time of Eve.

173
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:38,524
Speaker 0: All right.

174
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:41,680
Speaker 0: So if anyone lives welcome to the space show was shown at the Otakon.

175
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, I go to if anyone's in the New York area.

176
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:46,520
Speaker 1: I highly recommend this month.

177
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:50,677
Speaker 1: well I guess next month in March check out the International Children's Film Festival.

178
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:59,951
Speaker 1: and If you like the anime movies, I'd recommend seeing at least one non anime movie summer wars is on DVD and blu-ray starting yesterday.

179
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:09,259
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day, what do you got?

180
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:15,646
Speaker 0: Oh, so the new hotness that everybody is all hotness about is obviously MLP FIM.

181
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:18,807
Speaker 1: I Enjoy my little pony.

182
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, we'll probably do a whole show on it.

183
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,320
Speaker 0: So I'll refrain from saying anything, you know too deep about it to ruin that future show.

184
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,524
Speaker 0: But here is a totally awesome super great my little pony AMV.

185
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:34,460
Speaker 1: it is way well done.

186
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:43,293
Speaker 1: I mean it's to the level of the good old anime music videos that we would show at conventions or at our IT anime The ones you used to see in like the tournament round.

187
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:44,780
Speaker 0: I would like to go to our T anime.

188
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,743
Speaker 0: Just show the same thing.

189
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:46,727
Speaker 1: Oh my god over.

190
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:52,006
Speaker 1: Well, I don't doubt for a second that they have already shown it at our IT And there's no way they didn't.

191
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:52,769
Speaker 0: I hope so.

192
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:54,616
Speaker 1: It's not really an AMV.

193
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:58,505
Speaker 1: It's not anime Animated music video.

194
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,556
Speaker 0: Yeah animation music video is spider-man manga.

195
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:08,800
Speaker 0: Japanese person would say No, it is way good or is it, you know the spider-man manga the one that.

196
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:15,207
Speaker 1: So in the spirit of AMV things of the day because Scott's still my thing of the day That was my head.

197
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:16,114
Speaker 1: I have another AMV.

198
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,271
Speaker 1: I want to go back to the classics because this one's way good, but it's new.

199
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:28,960
Speaker 1: and I realized again that a Good half if not more of the good anime music videos I've ever seen or done by Kevin Caldwell.

200
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,629
Speaker 1: So I linked to one of my favorite AMVs.

201
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,800
Speaker 1: it is to koto cha and it is pretty great.

202
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:39,140
Speaker 0: You know people like koto cha like people don't bring it up at all anymore.

203
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,615
Speaker 1: But this used to be a super popular is a super huge big day deal.

204
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:45,518
Speaker 0: It's got OAVs.

205
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:46,240
Speaker 0: It's got movies.

206
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,043
Speaker 0: It's got TV.

207
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:47,865
Speaker 0: It's got manga.

208
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:54,020
Speaker 0: right if you ask a Japanese person with ultra relaxes, there's some good odds They'll know how to do the frickin dance.

209
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,980
Speaker 1: If you ask any anime fan in America who went to conventions in the 90s, they'll know koto cha, right?

210
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,820
Speaker 0: So this is like a huge deal that like completely disappeared from the mind share of it.

211
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,691
Speaker 0: Nobody talks about fans in the US, right?

212
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:10,100
Speaker 0: So maybe we'll have to watch it and do a show on it.

213
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,501
Speaker 0: We got it.

214
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,503
Speaker 0: We got to bring it back.

215
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:16,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean this kind of like I don't know golden boy Battle athlete.

216
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,840
Speaker 0: those are not quite the same as koto cha.

217
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,271
Speaker 0: They don't have OAVs and TVs now they don't.

218
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:22,919
Speaker 0: and dances that everybody knows.

219
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,113
Speaker 1: Mangas and you know, I guess part of it's you know, the main bit.

220
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,380
Speaker 1: we're talking about mahoutse kaitai.

221
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,940
Speaker 1: But I I suddenly remembered all the anime that I loved from a long time ago that I haven't seen in a long time.

222
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:35,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, that's a lot of it.

223
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:39,860
Speaker 1: But I guess we should do the meta moment because a lot of conventions are coming up in a hurry.

224
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,785
Speaker 1: I remember back in the day convention season.

225
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:47,100
Speaker 1: It's weird, but convention season for me used to be May through like early September.

226
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,040
Speaker 0: Well, most of the conventions are always in the summer because that's summer is to traditional convention season because that's when people are not in school.

227
00:12:54,081 --> 00:13:00,700
Speaker 0: So you can get and you know You can get the most people to show up on a summer weekend and you won't have weather ruining you and such and such.

228
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:00,961
Speaker 0: Yeah,

229
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:01,563
Speaker 1: but I'm San

230
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:06,482
Speaker 0: Diego comic-con Otakon, you know, these things are all in July August You know,

231
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:14,040
Speaker 1: I think anime central was in May but it was like May June July August September was all my cons and then there was katsu khan like hanging off by itself in February

232
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:14,481
Speaker 0: Yep,

233
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:19,556
Speaker 1: but now it's like February starts our convention season and that just goes constantly through the

234
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:20,780
Speaker 0: forever.

235
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:25,023
Speaker 0: Well, I think what happened right is that you had more conventions Can you know?

236
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:28,960
Speaker 0: and the thing is we go to a wider geographic area of conventions?

237
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,213
Speaker 1: We also stopped going to a lot of conventions though.

238
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:35,934
Speaker 1: We got like we hit a peak I think earlier and I don't think we go to more cons now than we used to.

239
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:38,380
Speaker 1: I think we just go to more quality Cons, right?

240
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:49,600
Speaker 0: But anyway, the thing is is that conventions as more of them appeared moved and shuffled to get out of the way and basically the bigger ones got the times they Wanted and all the other ones that have moved to the side, right?

241
00:13:50,381 --> 00:14:02,560
Speaker 0: so you've got like anime Boston in April and you got PAX East in March and you've got New York comic-con in October and you Got PAX West in September and you got Otakon in August July and you got kinetic on also in all.

242
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,929
Speaker 1: now The reason I bring that up.

243
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,420
Speaker 1: It's kind of you know, this is the meta moment.

244
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:09,100
Speaker 1: Usually we just do announcements, but this is kind of a very gignite scheduling thing.

245
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,477
Speaker 1: A lot of people inquire asking us to come to conventions many of them like generic on.

246
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:19,167
Speaker 1: a lot of cons recently have been asking us to come and Don't feel bad that we don't come.

247
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:23,060
Speaker 1: we basically are already at critical mass of very large conventions.

248
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:24,886
Speaker 1: Yeah Let alone small ones.

249
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,480
Speaker 0: and part of the reason we don't come is now that we're in New York City.

250
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,078
Speaker 0: We used to go to more mostly because we had cars and we had more free time.

251
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:35,099
Speaker 1: now That's not in any way the reason I don't go to little cons.

252
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:35,984
Speaker 0: That's the reason.

253
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:38,636
Speaker 0: one of the reasons I'm going is because you know, we're in the city.

254
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:39,460
Speaker 0: We don't have cars.

255
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,520
Speaker 0: So, you know getting there it is is an extra cost and I can just go down and get that zipcar if I want it.

256
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:45,882
Speaker 1: That's not.

257
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:47,268
Speaker 1: that's not the reason I don't go.

258
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they still.

259
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:49,620
Speaker 0: it's one of the reasons I'm not going.

260
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:50,365
Speaker 0: It's it's.

261
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:52,740
Speaker 0: it's an increased cost of transportation.

262
00:14:53,361 --> 00:15:00,159
Speaker 0: And is it really worth a vacation day and a whole weekend, you know for a car, you know It's got you got to make it worth my while.

263
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:08,783
Speaker 0: You know Scott Some conventions make it worth my while because their conventions are so awesome that it's worthwhile Like packs.

264
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:18,440
Speaker 0: and some conventions make it worthwhile because they're so awesome like anime Boston, but anime Boston also Gives us money, which I would still go if they did not give us money.

265
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,386
Speaker 0: But they do because they just do.

266
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:27,472
Speaker 1: but I guess the whole moral of this is just that we've been rebuffing a lot of requests Lately, so if anyone's listening you're wondering why.

267
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:31,050
Speaker 1: you know, maybe you told your convention Hey get geek nice and geek night side.

268
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,779
Speaker 0: This meta moment is turning into the meta month.

269
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:35,052
Speaker 0: So let's let's just get to it.

270
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:39,251
Speaker 1: the convention is the original Intent of the meta moment to get out all the kind of meta.

271
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:41,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's also supposed to only be a moment.

272
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:42,980
Speaker 0: We don't want to fill the show with too much meta.

273
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,375
Speaker 0: So the conventions we are going to in very near times are PAX East.

274
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:56,611
Speaker 0: we're doing three panels Week after PAX East Zenkai con we're doing a bunch of pan one anime panel Then the rest is all gaming kind of old recycled packs panels.

275
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,920
Speaker 0: and then in April anime, Boston.

276
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:05,940
Speaker 1: We are confirmed as always preferred panelists will be an anime Boston bringing the a-game and those are the near-term conventions.

277
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:08,811
Speaker 0: You should go to all our way.

278
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:09,636
Speaker 1: You want to hurry this up.

279
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:09,999
Speaker 1: You're all.

280
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:12,129
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

281
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:12,814
Speaker 0: You're delaying it.

282
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:21,018
Speaker 0: right now We have all signs of websites and Twitter accounts and all sorts of internet presence for front row crew.

283
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:26,440
Speaker 0: calm You should go and check out all our stuffs and our Twitter's and everything to participate with us.

284
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,837
Speaker 1: You see I feel like this would be more focused if every show you just did one like don't forget the forum.

285
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:32,586
Speaker 1: and then some Other show be like don't forget.

286
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:34,960
Speaker 1: We got a Twitter that tweets out the things of the day.

287
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:36,244
Speaker 0: We could do that.

288
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:37,130
Speaker 1: I don't think we need the whole.

289
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,720
Speaker 1: we've got an internet thing.

290
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,012
Speaker 1: All right, if you're worried about speeding it up.

291
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:42,420
Speaker 1: I mean, that's the best way to speed it.

292
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so you're slowing it down right now again.

293
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:48,000
Speaker 0: The book club book is Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

294
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,114
Speaker 0: How far in that I'd still didn't read anything beyond chapter one.

295
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,344
Speaker 0: I Got time.

296
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:54,170
Speaker 1: you got time.

297
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:54,814
Speaker 1: We should.

298
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,689
Speaker 1: we could do the show though It's an important book.

299
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,639
Speaker 0: We'll do it real soon.

300
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:06,883
Speaker 1: So way back when we were at our IT We would you know pick up just a random anime or if we couldn't pick anything we'd ask the wise and old veterans of the Anime club.

301
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:08,229
Speaker 1: Hey, what should we watch?

302
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:10,760
Speaker 0: They pretty much just watched everything eventually.

303
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:20,819
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean there were literally like four or five hundred VHS tapes of just fan subs and pro releases and everything and we got up To a thousand while we were running the club later with Scott Johnson.

304
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:26,436
Speaker 1: Even when we were freshmen there was more anime than we could ever possibly watch.

305
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,900
Speaker 0: our consumption rate However was extremely high.

306
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,741
Speaker 0: We watched a ton of and well the entire for enemies that if they came out today We would not even give a second Look.

307
00:17:35,063 --> 00:17:38,860
Speaker 1: the entire front row crew as it was back then would go to the anime club and we were all members.

308
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,811
Speaker 1: So after we'd all go to the library and each one of us would check out three tapes And then we would.

309
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:44,680
Speaker 0: we had a lot of people.

310
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,252
Speaker 0: So if you had five people you had 15 VHS tapes of anime.

311
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:50,400
Speaker 0: many of those tapes had like four episodes on.

312
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,645
Speaker 1: That's all of Ava.

313
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:53,152
Speaker 0: That's a lot of tapes.

314
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:57,480
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember that one time on my birthday I happened to win the raffle and it was my birthday.

315
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:00,439
Speaker 1: So they gave me a gift and the gift was check out as many tapes as you want.

316
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:03,160
Speaker 1: Yep, I checked out all of Ava in fact that day.

317
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:11,780
Speaker 1: But of all the many shows we watched at RIT one that I kind of Forgot about until relatively recently was Maho Skytie Magic Users Club the OAV.

318
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not talking about the TV show or the manga or any of the other stuff related to it.

319
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of crazy that this show that people really don't know about or you don't even know exists.

320
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:26,442
Speaker 1: Mostly I've never seen a cosplay of this Ever.

321
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:27,407
Speaker 0: I don't know if I have.

322
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:28,131
Speaker 0: I don't remember it.

323
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:42,052
Speaker 1: I might have maybe It's possible but anyway It's just a random show that we watched one of many many shows and when I remembered that it existed a few months ago I remembered that I enjoyed it, but I didn't remember the plot at all.

324
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:43,136
Speaker 0: I remembered.

325
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,267
Speaker 0: I remember aliens Yeah, and there was a magic.

326
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:55,480
Speaker 0: there were kids at a high school and they had a club where they were doing magic Yeah, and that next door to them was the manga club that was fighting with them by pushing the wall back.

327
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,040
Speaker 1: I remembered that very clearly.

328
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:07,075
Speaker 0: I knew that the aliens had a big bell and I remembered what the main character looked like with like her hair looks like a Mop, and I remember that the main dude is told nerd.

329
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:08,380
Speaker 0: and that's all I remembered.

330
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:19,175
Speaker 1: The only other two things I remember that are very important Is that one at some point in the end sigh the main girl has to draw a magic circle and she kind of fucks it Up, I don't remember that.

331
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:23,440
Speaker 0: remember I watched it and I saw that but I don't remember that stood out in my mind.

332
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,380
Speaker 1: I couldn't tell you why and that the opener is one of my favorite openers to an anime.

333
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,945
Speaker 0: I was a real good opener with the That little bit.

334
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:31,468
Speaker 1: you'll all know.

335
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:32,111
Speaker 1: watch the opener.

336
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,056
Speaker 1: I'll link to just pa.

337
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:35,082
Speaker 1: pa and it's.

338
00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:38,454
Speaker 1: I don't know that just the openers is so like 90s anime fun.

339
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:43,690
Speaker 0: and Well, the whole show is 90s anime fun, right?

340
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,819
Speaker 0: I mean especially with like casting magic spells like it.

341
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:48,943
Speaker 0: It's.

342
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:52,619
Speaker 0: it's a lot of the slayers kind of humor that goes on.

343
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:59,448
Speaker 0: I guess I did not including like, you know tall big-breasted women who go It's in the whole thing.

344
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,780
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't remember much else about the show.

345
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,300
Speaker 1: I didn't know how the plot was resolved written really what the plot was.

346
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:15,700
Speaker 1: No I really Didn't know if the show would hold up because I have nostalgia for a lot of anime and you know I rewatched Ava not that long ago and Oh Ava's brilliant and everyone says otherwise is stupid.

347
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:20,558
Speaker 1: I rewatched Trigun not that long ago great show but not as great as I remembered.

348
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:28,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know it's a mixed bag watch an old anime that used to like and My own sky tie actually way exceeded my expectations of holding up.

349
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:35,431
Speaker 0: Well and the one hand right it sort of you know Exceeded it and also did not exceed the expectations.

350
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:41,755
Speaker 0: right because I was expecting like all right It'll be a cute magic girl show whatever, you know, it'll be.

351
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,160
Speaker 0: it'll be average, right?

352
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,620
Speaker 0: But it was slightly above average, but it was way more perverted than I ever remember.

353
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,263
Speaker 1: See, I don't.

354
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:51,533
Speaker 1: I would argue that it's not really that perverted.

355
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:53,000
Speaker 0: It's pretty perverted.

356
00:20:53,861 --> 00:21:09,530
Speaker 0: Even in the extreme climax of the final episode where they're resolving the core plot They're fantasizing with the panty shots and the boobs and such at the even at the very height of every, you know I mean at least some shows that have fan service.

357
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:15,008
Speaker 0: when you get down to resolving the core plot They can put the fan service behind them.

358
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:17,580
Speaker 0: the thing is and the fans focus on the climax.

359
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:21,537
Speaker 1: Here's a big difference between an old anime like this and modern fanservice.

360
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,892
Speaker 0: That is true Is that the fan service is a lot less gratuitous.

361
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:28,080
Speaker 0: No, not even what I'm gonna say kiss exists.

362
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:39,880
Speaker 1: All I'm saying is that the fanservice in this show was basically serving the joke that Takeo You know the president of the Magic Club would get distracted and kind of whenever there's a dangerous situation.

363
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,452
Speaker 1: He just kind of have this weird fantasy.

364
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:44,020
Speaker 1: It always played that one weird song.

365
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess if you're unable to think in the meta Then you could do you.

366
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,260
Speaker 0: you could say that that is an excuse for all the pervertedness.

367
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,400
Speaker 0: But then is not the you know, Moe excuse also valid?

368
00:21:55,842 --> 00:22:02,319
Speaker 1: Because I also note that the way they did those scenes is that every time every time there was fan service They wouldn't really animate it.

369
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,815
Speaker 1: They'd come to like a series of kind of blurry shots of life and it was always the same stupid fantasy.

370
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:13,772
Speaker 1: He's always like oh They're all gonna suddenly rip their clothes off and adore me.

371
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:17,102
Speaker 0: Well, that was the clever trick They use.

372
00:22:17,223 --> 00:22:19,610
Speaker 0: right is basically okay in.

373
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:32,530
Speaker 0: the characters won't actually get all sexual and naked But what we'll do is we'll have this one guy The pervert will imagine them doing that so we can draw them in their underwear without the characters quote Really being in their underwear.

374
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:34,120
Speaker 0: Ah, but thus they won't be like.

375
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,948
Speaker 1: version of Takeo is very.

376
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:39,074
Speaker 1: I don't know it fits his character.

377
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:39,375
Speaker 1: all that.

378
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:45,115
Speaker 0: I guess the characters are all really yes We made a perverted character so we could make the anime perverted but he's not that perverted.

379
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,380
Speaker 1: He's actually just a loophole.

380
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:48,127
Speaker 1: He's just a nice normal guy.

381
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:48,749
Speaker 0: He's a nice.

382
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,620
Speaker 0: He's a relatively nice not as creepy pervert.

383
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:59,840
Speaker 1: Still I'm curious why you're fixating on this so much because there actually wasn't that much fan service.

384
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,824
Speaker 0: Is it really it just?

385
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:08,960
Speaker 0: it really stood out to me when I while I did not remember the show being you know Like that and when I watch it again, it just really stood out like every single episode.

386
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,615
Speaker 0: There were like at least four or five, you know, everybody's in their underwear Joe.

387
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:15,062
Speaker 1: actually no there was about one Explosion.

388
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:16,768
Speaker 0: now there was quite a few for it.

389
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:20,360
Speaker 0: I don't know what you watch count because there were definitely multiple.

390
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:26,020
Speaker 1: I'm really surprised that that stood out to you so much because what stood out to me was just how funny it was.

391
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:29,000
Speaker 0: It was pretty funny, but it wasn't extremely fun.

392
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:33,279
Speaker 0: I mean, you know other than the pervertedness the rest of the show it was like.

393
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,600
Speaker 0: alright It was like ko beast maybe better than ko beast quality.

394
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:46,378
Speaker 0: It was like hey, you know this plot with the aliens is actually pretty interesting and you know The even though each episode is sort of like an episodic kind of.

395
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:46,720
Speaker 0: you know.

396
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:55,029
Speaker 0: Situation is they're actually stringing it together and the characters are actually good characters and you know the there are plenty of funniness of.

397
00:23:55,149 --> 00:24:01,560
Speaker 1: I'm just still hung up on your weird kind of Fixation on the relatively minimal fan service II jokes in the show.

398
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:01,996
Speaker 1: I don't know.

399
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,585
Speaker 0: I don't know if you've been watching like a whole bunch of crazy moe shows that you know I just that perversion was minimal.

400
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:12,340
Speaker 1: level of fan service is barely what I would even use the word perversion for okay.

401
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,180
Speaker 0: So maybe on some animes otaku scale On a normal person scale is pretty high.

402
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:23,596
Speaker 1: Have you watched any popular show like Dexter lately?

403
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:24,740
Speaker 1: There's similar level.

404
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,827
Speaker 0: I even know what that is.

405
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you don't watch anything.

406
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:28,040
Speaker 1: You have no perspective.

407
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:32,280
Speaker 0: Maybe show maybe TVs just getting real perverted and I've been watching too many old animes.

408
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,180
Speaker 1: But Scott if it's getting really perverted old stuff isn't any more perverted than news.

409
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,188
Speaker 0: I mean, I've been watching like 70s stuff though.

410
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:41,080
Speaker 1: So a lot of 70s stuff is also kind of perverted.

411
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:43,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, the galaxy Express is not preferred.

412
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:46,473
Speaker 1: I wouldn't use the word perverted if I had to say anything off the show.

413
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:50,143
Speaker 1: I'd call it a heartwarming Comedy.

414
00:24:50,163 --> 00:24:52,310
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's it's you know, the perversion is not.

415
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,180
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that the perversion is the majority of the show.

416
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,380
Speaker 0: I'm saying is that saying that it's barely know worthy and you're really fixed is definitely noteworthy.

417
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:04,082
Speaker 0: It is a. it is not a majority but it is at least like 10%.

418
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:08,400
Speaker 1: First episode of blue seed was way more perverted than mahout sky tie.

419
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:09,245
Speaker 0: I'm not saying.

420
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:11,860
Speaker 0: I'm saying is that on an anime scale right?

421
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,150
Speaker 0: It's probably less perverted than a lot of animes But it is still quite perverted.

422
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:23,051
Speaker 0: a significant portion of this show is TNA and underwear And ladies and you know it is.

423
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:25,742
Speaker 0: if you cut that out you would have 10% less.

424
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,692
Speaker 1: you have to go to the listeners on this.

425
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:32,740
Speaker 1: you guys watch the show cuz one, you know If you want to skip the whole review the show I think is definitely worth watching.

426
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:34,485
Speaker 0: It's a short OAV.

427
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:38,300
Speaker 0: You can watch it in like a night and it's really entertaining and really funny.

428
00:25:39,023 --> 00:25:48,793
Speaker 1: I'm just I'm asking you this listeners when you watch it think to yourself how Perverted you think this show is and compare my feelings to Scott's.

429
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:49,074
Speaker 1: Okay.

430
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:51,079
Speaker 0: We'll compare it to apocalypse zero.

431
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,404
Speaker 0: Sure It's completely clean.

432
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:53,307
Speaker 0: It's safe for children.

433
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:53,949
Speaker 0: No Scott.

434
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:57,320
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that I don't think they're gonna find it terribly perverted.

435
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:59,246
Speaker 0: I am saying a significant portion.

436
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:01,032
Speaker 0: I think you have a 10%.

437
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:02,536
Speaker 1: I think you're you're obsessed.

438
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:03,640
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm obsessed.

439
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,240
Speaker 1: So anyway, the plot of mahout sky tie is actually pretty straightforward.

440
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,080
Speaker 1: There's aliens that come down and they're better than everything we've got.

441
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,858
Speaker 1: They just wipe out all the armies of the world and they have this giant bell and they broadcast that We're here to take over the earth and invade it.

442
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:24,929
Speaker 1: Yeah And then they just kind of stick around and everyone just kind of gets used to them and they're just there Watching everybody like going and they're weird.

443
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:25,290
Speaker 0: They're not eat.

444
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,595
Speaker 0: They're like weird robot aliens.

445
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:30,238
Speaker 0: They're not like green aliens they're all robots and mechanical type shit.

446
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:41,800
Speaker 1: and Independent of this a guy happens to know magic and he started a magic users club in his school like any other club and it's actually one of the Least popular clubs and no one really cares about it.

447
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,538
Speaker 1: But they actually just do real magic and I kind of like how the way the show does the magic is they?

448
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,322
Speaker 1: they have these Kind of fetishes that they use, you know The little duck.

449
00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:53,880
Speaker 0: if the aesthetic styling of the magic is pretty cool because I get they draw symbols.

450
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:55,772
Speaker 0: They had the quacking duck on a stick.

451
00:26:55,812 --> 00:27:00,993
Speaker 0: They ride on a broom Which is but they're not which is very self consistent.

452
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,100
Speaker 1: and just like the duck is never explained.

453
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,227
Speaker 1: None of that stuff is explained.

454
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,092
Speaker 0: It is explained.

455
00:27:05,112 --> 00:27:07,985
Speaker 0: It's Explained in episode four.

456
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:09,530
Speaker 1: I think yes, it's explained that.

457
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:09,810
Speaker 1: yes.

458
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:11,315
Speaker 1: I got the duck from this box.

459
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:12,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was a basically he.

460
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:16,191
Speaker 1: Where'd the box come from?

461
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:17,259
Speaker 1: Why is it a duck?

462
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,767
Speaker 0: There's no it's an ancient artifact.

463
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,460
Speaker 0: and he found his box in a cliffside cave near the beach.

464
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:25,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that box contained all the magics.

465
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:31,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was an ancient relic of magic from an agent Anything beyond that.

466
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:33,300
Speaker 1: like they didn't go into any depth at all.

467
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,869
Speaker 1: It's just this is the way it works.

468
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:36,920
Speaker 1: a picture of this thing will make magic happen.

469
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,195
Speaker 0: There was a magic book that was in the box that told him what to do.

470
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:41,969
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, they didn't go into anything beyond that.

471
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:43,495
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the explanations in the book.

472
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:44,158
Speaker 0: You just haven't read it.

473
00:27:47,183 --> 00:28:00,800
Speaker 1: And they decide he decides Takeo that he's going to fight the bell But actually he only decided this because he wants to impress the girls who I don't even know I don't even really understand the whole like the motivation to fight the bell.

474
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:06,223
Speaker 0: I mean cuz it's like in the beginning of the first episode they're going out to investigate it right on their brooms And whatever.

475
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:07,550
Speaker 1: cuz the bell keeps messing with them.

476
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,173
Speaker 1: That's why they wanted.

477
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:08,997
Speaker 0: does the bell key?

478
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:09,520
Speaker 0: messing with them?

479
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,761
Speaker 1: It just sort of rolls around town checking shit out until it sees magic and then it freaks the fuck out and tries to kill People.

480
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:19,097
Speaker 0: right but that was only after they went and started using the magic near it wasn't messing with they.

481
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:21,940
Speaker 0: I think they messed with The bell first before the bell messed with them.

482
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:28,060
Speaker 1: Oh, but I point out not to really spoil But once you know what the bell was actually after they were pretty justified in fighting the bell.

483
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:29,325
Speaker 0: But I mean the bell was sort of.

484
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:30,952
Speaker 0: I mean, here's the thing right?

485
00:28:31,153 --> 00:28:31,796
Speaker 0: That's the trick.

486
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,342
Speaker 0: That's what the bell is So smart.

487
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,873
Speaker 0: wait, you know, they attacked the bell right away.

488
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,720
Speaker 0: Did you do but remember Independence Day, right?

489
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,270
Speaker 0: It's like are these aliens peaceful or are they bad?

490
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,607
Speaker 0: and then so it's like well, we don't know yet So we can't attack yet.

491
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,353
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

492
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:45,320
Speaker 0: They're bad, right?

493
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,265
Speaker 0: It was like you don't know.

494
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:49,719
Speaker 1: until they do so, of course, I point out they did not attack it They simply flew up to it.

495
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:58,684
Speaker 0: Well, no the the opener the very beginning part of every episode which is actually really cool because they keep it completely silent because you Can't hear anything in space You know.

496
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:11,756
Speaker 0: and then as soon as you can hear it once the the opener gets down into the house I got that really not holding up CG from Gonzo Yeah, but they clearly the humans clearly went to war against the bell and laughs.

497
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:19,197
Speaker 1: but they point out before That in the overture it says the bell arrived and announced to the world that it was invading.

498
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:21,243
Speaker 0: okay, okay I guess that counts.

499
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:23,852
Speaker 0: but in you know, it wasn't invading like.

500
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:28,145
Speaker 1: and at the end the bell was like yeah, we were here to invade Yeah, but it didn't.

501
00:29:28,206 --> 00:29:31,606
Speaker 0: it wasn't invading in a militaristic way I think it was.

502
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:37,270
Speaker 0: I think it just was didn't have all the info yet It was yeah, it had years and years and years of reconnaissance.

503
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:38,414
Speaker 1: Yes, and it wasn't done.

504
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:41,605
Speaker 0: It wasn't done with his reconnaissance What was really cool.

505
00:29:41,705 --> 00:29:45,119
Speaker 0: this is one of the and if they're doing reconnaissance in plain sight like here I am.

506
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:59,440
Speaker 1: No, any live planes big black balls rolling on the show is basically that this magic users Club antagonizes the bell and It's a cast of five just actually I'd say really strong really well done characters that complement each other.

507
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,845
Speaker 1: Well, and what is a very heartwarming?

508
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:05,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean even the weakest character the the sort of the girl who's I guess semi famous.

509
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,211
Speaker 1: Any of their names?

510
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:10,240
Speaker 1: can you name anyone from the show?

511
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,222
Speaker 0: I forget them all.

512
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:14,074
Speaker 1: so not Sion Anika the two main characters.

513
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:14,636
Speaker 0: That's their names.

514
00:30:14,797 --> 00:30:15,339
Speaker 1: Takeo.

515
00:30:15,802 --> 00:30:16,306
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

516
00:30:16,387 --> 00:30:17,153
Speaker 1: Abras above.

517
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:17,959
Speaker 0: Are you looking at a list?

518
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,267
Speaker 1: Well, I remember them because of the.

519
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:28,151
Speaker 1: every time they did the eye catches or not the eye catches but the Caffeine, um, you know, they're like what's coming up in the next episode.

520
00:30:28,172 --> 00:30:30,200
Speaker 1: They just scream each other's names over and over again.

521
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,347
Speaker 1: I Never watched the coming up in the next episode.

522
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,752
Speaker 0: Oh, you should have watched those.

523
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:36,944
Speaker 1: They were actually.

524
00:30:36,964 --> 00:30:41,540
Speaker 1: that was a big part of my anime culture back in the day is watching that for every episode of every show.

525
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never.

526
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:50,960
Speaker 1: I never watched the next episode bits except for initial D Don't miss it, but likes the main character Sion Anika that have this good thing going on with each other.

527
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,628
Speaker 1: They're kind of I don't know sighs one of those cute ditzy girls, but it's not.

528
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:08,036
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there you can see sort of like some moe precursors present But they're so small and it's definitely not full-on moe.

529
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,040
Speaker 0: So it's like hey, whatever.

530
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,100
Speaker 1: Well while she has the moe precursors at the same time, she kicks some ass and takes some name.

531
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,006
Speaker 0: Well clearly, you know, it's not it.

532
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,050
Speaker 0: So I'm saying is there?

533
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:18,940
Speaker 0: the precursors are pretty much just like she falls down a lot.

534
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:20,773
Speaker 1: I love her as a character sighs.

535
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:21,518
Speaker 1: You're so cute.

536
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:28,177
Speaker 1: I enjoyed the way she interacted that one scene because she kept bumping into everyone and just being kind of klutzy.

537
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:36,212
Speaker 1: and the one time Akane is walking up and she turns around and she's like And they don't collide and she's like I did it.

538
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:49,740
Speaker 0: I Think the best character though is the is Oberetsubo, no, well, he's alright, but the Jeff the sidekick girl who Danica Yeah, the spunky girl who's like you should quit this fucking club.

539
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:54,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz she's like the most, you know level-headed not weird one, you know.

540
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:56,815
Speaker 1: I would say that Akane the fashion girl is equally level-headed.

541
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:57,620
Speaker 1: She just doesn't care.

542
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:01,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, kinda but it's like she just has really strong magic for some reason.

543
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just has kind of a spin to it.

544
00:32:04,431 --> 00:32:06,077
Speaker 0: And every time she gets mad you just spins.

545
00:32:06,137 --> 00:32:09,400
Speaker 0: I don't know why This happens now.

546
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:14,868
Speaker 1: I don't it's hard to say if my perception was colored though because I actually Because we just did a show on dubs and sub.

547
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,460
Speaker 1: I watched the center Niklaus dub.

548
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,178
Speaker 1: You know what?

549
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,343
Speaker 0: Most dubs are bad.

550
00:32:21,764 --> 00:32:25,315
Speaker 1: This dub is not great, but it is not terrible.

551
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:28,624
Speaker 1: I actually do not Disrecommend the dub.

552
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:29,367
Speaker 0: I watch this up.

553
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:32,680
Speaker 1: Nanaka is of course Lisa Ortez, you know, it's all like good.

554
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:39,280
Speaker 1: Well relatively good American voice actors and surprisingly the Japanese cast is pretty high-powered.

555
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,752
Speaker 1: They got a while junco to do Akane.

556
00:32:41,772 --> 00:32:50,064
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm famous singer and Takehito Koyasu Shit plays Oberetsubo, of course Of course good.

557
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:56,357
Speaker 1: I do like the one scene where you know, cuz part of the plot is that Oberetsubo is totally gay for the main character.

558
00:32:56,478 --> 00:32:59,089
Speaker 0: Yep Like I'm the one it's.

559
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,920
Speaker 0: it's weird because it's all stereotypical tropes.

560
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:09,840
Speaker 0: Well, no because he's sort of acting in such a strong Come on way that you almost think he's just sarcastically fooling around kind of a put-on.

561
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:14,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he's not actually gay for the main character, but no he actually is gay for the main character.

562
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:14,882
Speaker 0: I love

563
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:19,546
Speaker 1: that scene where they're staying over in the beach house and he's just laying there obviously Dreaming about something cuz it's

564
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:28,940
Speaker 0: like if I was like if I go to rim and I'm like, hey, baby, you know People be like, okay, he's just joking around right, you know, they might you know say mad, but you know, it's joking around.

565
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,155
Speaker 0: But the thing is he's like hey, baby, but he's not joking.

566
00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:33,059
Speaker 0: He really wants him.

567
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:41,887
Speaker 1: There's that one scene where they're sleeping in the same room together He's just kind of freaking out weird and fantasizing and then and the main characters like I mustn't fall asleep I mustn't fall asleep.

568
00:33:41,947 --> 00:33:45,844
Speaker 0: I wasn't Classic sort of.

569
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:46,607
Speaker 1: I guess it's the.

570
00:33:47,168 --> 00:34:00,600
Speaker 1: this show if we have to review it has a lot of like if you watch it Stereotypical 90s anime like straight up all the tropes and yet it executes them Elegantly and humorously and it has really good animation.

571
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:03,312
Speaker 1: Oh, the animation is nothing not.

572
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,718
Speaker 0: and good, you know, except for the CGs.

573
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:07,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the animation is great.

574
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:14,199
Speaker 1: And I realized watching a lot of old anime recently not 70s anime which doesn't have this so much except for the mech stuff.

575
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:21,080
Speaker 1: but 90s OAVs in particular tend to one be way better than their equivalent TV shows.

576
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:23,527
Speaker 1: you know El Hazzard, Tenchi and two.

577
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:24,188
Speaker 0: they have

578
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:37,928
Speaker 1: that kind of old-world cell animation where there's tons of weird little comedic details all over the place like little facial expressions background characters make reacting to things and Everything's kind of moving and there's always stuff going on everywhere like

579
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:41,357
Speaker 0: a new type magazine in the trash can in the apartment.

580
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:49,147
Speaker 1: or you know Things on the posters are on the school like someone like in the foreground, you know, they're hitting on each other Whatever in the background.

581
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:53,395
Speaker 1: the two girls are like sharing this look Mm-hmm and like kind of whispering to each other.

582
00:34:53,415 --> 00:35:00,160
Speaker 1: all these little Tiny details little shivers that the main character does every time he's hit on that are all you wouldn't even notice them.

583
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:04,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't know a lot of new crappy anime doesn't have anything like that.

584
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:05,461
Speaker 0: No They don't.

585
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:10,919
Speaker 1: they don't bother with like background details this weird specific kind of detail that you really see in these 90s OAVs.

586
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:15,020
Speaker 0: That's the kind of stuff you also see like manga backgrounds to that, you know.

587
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,288
Speaker 0: They just they don't.

588
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:18,160
Speaker 0: you know, not so many people are doing that anymore.

589
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, the show also kind of elegantly like, you know with the duck like.

590
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:24,340
Speaker 1: they explained it like you said to a degree But they didn't really explain it explain it enough.

591
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:35,584
Speaker 1: but there's tons of other things like that that are just the world is presented to you and Yet beyond like it's presented to you as though this is just the way it is and they don't bother with the fanboy level of Explanation.

592
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,839
Speaker 1: they just give you enough to make the show work.

593
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:43,380
Speaker 1: A lot of modern shows either have the fanboy explanation like gunslinger girl type shows.

594
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:45,404
Speaker 1: You know where they go.

595
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:48,454
Speaker 1: like this is the specific bullshit of this specific bullshit moe.

596
00:35:48,474 --> 00:35:49,999
Speaker 0: Well, they explain every single freaking.

597
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:55,080
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, well, I think the one thing that the show really that makes the show really strong right is the alien part.

598
00:35:55,221 --> 00:36:02,780
Speaker 0: Right is because if you look at all the old animes Especially the ones that we like or that were really really well liked it from the olden days, right?

599
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:09,760
Speaker 0: the one thing a great majority have that have in common is the Central sort of sci-fi mystery, right?

600
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Speaker 0: Even if it wasn't some shows were sci-fi shows right such as say vote Tom's or Ava.

601
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,246
Speaker 1: Hey, let's go a step further.

602
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,095
Speaker 1: even look at fantasy shows like slayers.

603
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,484
Speaker 1: slayers is goofy comedy But it has the.

604
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:35,400
Speaker 0: here is the serious backdrop plot that if you just wrote down what that plot was I'm saying is that you know Somebody's old shows if they were sci-fi shows had a mystery at their core some sort of thing That is like to be discovered at the ending.

605
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:51,239
Speaker 0: It's like who what the hell is this mysterious thing that carries us through the show that's always in the background Right, even cowboy bebop has that right and pretty almost every you know, cool show You know macross everything has a sci-fi mystery even shows that are not sci-fi shows.

606
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:56,697
Speaker 0: Fancy la la right or you know stuff like that has a sci-fi mystery.

607
00:36:56,738 --> 00:37:01,557
Speaker 0: not always Sci-fi no, but a lot of the times it is a sci-fi mystery at the core.

608
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:02,380
Speaker 1: I would pull back.

609
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:09,137
Speaker 1: There's two things, you know, what got me into anime other than the fact that it was crazy Ultraviolet cartoons I'd never seen before.

610
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:13,925
Speaker 1: cuz you know I was eight and I watched vampire hunter D but it was that there were.

611
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:23,900
Speaker 1: it was different and a lot of the old 90s anime was just really sci-fi or really fantasy really kind Of out there and had these plots and some of that is lacking from a lot of new stuff.

612
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:25,871
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think a lot of new shows right.

613
00:37:26,092 --> 00:37:27,520
Speaker 0: they made mahoutsukai tie today.

614
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:35,212
Speaker 0: It would have been the magic club strike which is without the aliens Yeah, and then it's like well that totally ruins the whole thing.

615
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:37,660
Speaker 1: or they would have done like darker than black.

616
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:38,279
Speaker 1: We're all right.

617
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:39,645
Speaker 1: Here's a plot but one.

618
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:43,539
Speaker 1: the whole show focuses on this plot and to the plot is so.

619
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:48,820
Speaker 1: Either they hide it all from you and it's not kind of elegantly done or you just don't give a shit about it.

620
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's all about.

621
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:52,740
Speaker 0: you have these characters so you can have this character drama.

622
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:58,400
Speaker 0: But you also have a you know and a sort of epic plot somewhere that you know for them to go do something.

623
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,626
Speaker 0: I think you get both at once.

624
00:37:59,927 --> 00:38:03,061
Speaker 0: if you do just one without the other it doesn't work So well.

625
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:12,785
Speaker 1: in contrast things there's the scenes where like sighs being really cute practicing riding on a broom And then she makes a little butt saddle for it cuz her butt really hurt And that's hilarious.

626
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:19,920
Speaker 1: and yet simultaneously you have like the scene where Akane is reading the bells mind That was some deep sci-fi awesome action right there.

627
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:28,020
Speaker 1: Like if you took just that scene You could you would not be able to differentiate the show from a dead serious sci-fi drama masterpiece.

628
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, just from that scene extrapolated out.

629
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:40,272
Speaker 1: and if you did the comedy It's the exact same thing for comedy and the show elegantly blended the two together in a way that many Shows not just anime are not able to do well.

630
00:38:40,373 --> 00:38:42,280
Speaker 0: Well, he's not able to do well recently, right?

631
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,935
Speaker 1: There's also a sort of idiosyncratic elegance like Jeffy or Jeff Coon.

632
00:38:46,397 --> 00:38:47,100
Speaker 0: Jeff is the best.

633
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:48,144
Speaker 1: I love how.

634
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:53,265
Speaker 1: you know, there's kind of a Gandalf the gray element going on there Yeah, and there's also just the.

635
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:54,911
Speaker 1: that's just her cute little thing.

636
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:57,600
Speaker 1: Like it's just hanging like a cell phone charm on her broom.

637
00:38:57,862 --> 00:38:59,797
Speaker 0: yeah, no, but there's the.

638
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,459
Speaker 0: What's it called?

639
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:15,790
Speaker 0: Right, if you look at more modern shows Right a lot of the shows today would are just the character parts and the only show, you know If I try to really think really hard about a recent show that actually has you know Character parts and the sci-fi mystery right?

640
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at like something like Haruhi has a sci-fi mystery.

641
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,334
Speaker 1: Hurry, actually, I think is the best example of a more recent show.

642
00:39:22,354 --> 00:39:26,449
Speaker 1: that gives me the same Feelings that a show like mahout sky tie does.

643
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,176
Speaker 0: yeah, but you know other shows.

644
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:32,239
Speaker 0: I'd even put them in You know, yeah, they were definitely in the same genre.

645
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,667
Speaker 0: So, you know what is cool as a sci-fi mystery.

646
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:38,720
Speaker 1: straight out if you liked Haruhi you will love mahout sky tie and vice versa.

647
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:39,548
Speaker 0: Yeah straight

648
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:42,244
Speaker 1: up without any Reservation I say that,

649
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:53,977
Speaker 0: you know, but try to try to think like some other recent animes that have come out right and Some of them are just you know, I mean not too many of them at all really or sci-fi Or have any kind of

650
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,180
Speaker 1: action

651
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,215
Speaker 0: Right.

652
00:39:56,235 --> 00:40:03,655
Speaker 0: Okay, so Right, so that doesn't really have you know, the the mystery of anything that's that's pretty much just.

653
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:07,159
Speaker 1: the first season had the mystery Of you know, what's up with the head?

654
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:11,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that was the what's up with the head was actually one of the characters dramas.

655
00:40:11,413 --> 00:40:16,860
Speaker 0: it wasn't really this sort of background You know thing that nobody knew what was up.

656
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,616
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the way we can sum this all up is that mahout sky tie.

657
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:21,159
Speaker 1: at least for me.

658
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:24,977
Speaker 1: It reminded me of how much I fucking loved anime in the 90s.

659
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,157
Speaker 1: But it's it didn't tell me that 90s anime was better.

660
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:35,457
Speaker 1: specifically It just taught me that the anime I liked from the 90s still holds up today by and large.

661
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:46,695
Speaker 1: Well this one Yeah, well I try gun was probably the least holding up relative to what I expected of anything I've watched in recent memory that I had seen back in the day.

662
00:40:46,715 --> 00:40:47,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

663
00:40:48,642 --> 00:40:49,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had to go.

664
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:50,549
Speaker 0: do a lot more re-watching.

665
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:50,931
Speaker 0: bring me.

666
00:40:50,971 --> 00:40:52,758
Speaker 1: Let's remember a lot of shows that I have seen.

667
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:54,765
Speaker 1: I Expected not to hold up.

668
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:55,046
Speaker 0: Yeah.

669
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:58,580
Speaker 0: Also, I don't you know, I don't remember if I watched or did not watch them.

670
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,565
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a Kai Tai TV.

671
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:02,539
Speaker 1: I've never seen the TV or have only seen the OAV?

672
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:04,585
Speaker 0: Like I don't even remember.

673
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:08,722
Speaker 0: so now I kind of want to go and check out the TV to see like did I see the TV?

674
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:09,867
Speaker 0: did I not see the TV?

675
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:11,113
Speaker 0: how much of the TV did I see?

676
00:41:11,173 --> 00:41:12,680
Speaker 0: if I saw any is it good?

677
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,262
Speaker 0: Is it bad?

678
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:13,905
Speaker 0: I don't know.

679
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:15,614
Speaker 0: how similar is the OAV?

680
00:41:15,654 --> 00:41:16,800
Speaker 0: who knows mystery?

681
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:22,100
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it picks up pretty much right where the OAV leaves off really so the aliens have been vanquished.

682
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,625
Speaker 1: Ah, there's just the fucking tree.

683
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:27,540
Speaker 1: Oh really and now they got to deal with the tree, but it's just a tree.

684
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:28,323
Speaker 0: What's the problem?

685
00:41:28,424 --> 00:41:30,071
Speaker 1: It's blocking out the Sun and the road.

686
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:32,824
Speaker 1: the pedals are busting everything up in Tokyo Really?

687
00:41:33,006 --> 00:41:38,993
Speaker 0: Yeah, they could be alright, baby but yeah That gets an interesting.

688
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:39,537
Speaker 0: Okay.

689
00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:42,069
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway, I mean I don't want to really like.

690
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:45,227
Speaker 1: I could talk a lot about all my favorite scenes and why I think they're Great, like.

691
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,200
Speaker 0: no, we don't need to do that.

692
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,300
Speaker 1: It's like what he's like when he one more when he's doing the the magic show for the manga club on the beach.

693
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:51,944
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

694
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:52,910
Speaker 1: And it's the magic shows.

695
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,580
Speaker 1: great and then he whips out the truth teller.

696
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:58,996
Speaker 1: But then look at the the mark of an elegant show.

697
00:41:59,037 --> 00:42:02,409
Speaker 1: they do the wow Thing with the truth teller and of course they bring it back.

698
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:13,049
Speaker 1: but they bring it back in such a subtle and Heartwarming and kind of sad way and it's that the show very bled blends Very well the drama and the comedy and the sci-fi all together.

699
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:14,212
Speaker 1: and just a great show.

700
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:16,298
Speaker 1: Yeah a solid B anime.

701
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:18,525
Speaker 0: Yeah You should watch this show.

702
00:42:18,545 --> 00:42:20,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much any anime fan should watch this.

00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:35,740
Speaker 1: also check out other similar OAVs, like I don't know El Hazzard the original Tenchi OAV.

709
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was hard.

710
00:42:37,104 --> 00:42:39,691
Speaker 0: that had the you know, the sci-fi mystery at the core.

711
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:43,944
Speaker 0: So did the original Tenchi OAV the original original Yeah, not any of the others.

712
