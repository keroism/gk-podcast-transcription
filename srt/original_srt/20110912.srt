1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,147
Speaker 0: It's Monday, September 12th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:11,629
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:12,171
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:13,194
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,327
Speaker 0: Tonight, the tech news that wasn't.

6
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:21,200
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,743
Speaker 0: I'm at BK on Sunday and...

8
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:28,988
Speaker 1: How many pirates did you have with them?

9
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:29,370
Speaker 1: Nine?

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,201
Speaker 0: Nine pirates with like eight hit points each.

11
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:36,358
Speaker 1: If you just level up a little bit they can't touch you.

12
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:37,263
Speaker 0: Nine hit points, Scott.

13
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,875
Speaker 0: I'm saying I can beat those pirates at level two.

14
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:39,975
Speaker 0: Yeah.

15
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:44,650
Speaker 0: In fact I was playing Final Fantasy 1 the other day.

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,474
Speaker 0: You know why?

17
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:45,554
Speaker 1: Why?

18
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,222
Speaker 0: I leveled because Emily never seen it.

19
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:52,684
Speaker 0: Like the original real deal one without any of the gimping or the graphic remakes or anything.

20
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:58,064
Speaker 0: And I realized some things that are now quite archaic.

21
00:00:58,586 --> 00:01:02,986
Speaker 0: You realize most people have never seen the words "hold reset while you turn off the

22
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:03,429
Speaker 0: power.".

23
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,051
Speaker 1: Yep.

24
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:04,613
Speaker 0: Yeah.

25
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:08,486
Speaker 0: But yeah, level two is all you need to be to beat Garland.

26
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,173
Speaker 1: Yeah, all to beat Garland, yeah.

27
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:10,915
Speaker 0: And the pirates?

28
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:12,984
Speaker 0: Way weaker than Garland.

29
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:14,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, you think so?

30
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,092
Speaker 1: Yeah.

31
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:17,181
Speaker 1: There's a lot of them, though.

32
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,874
Speaker 0: You're guaranteed to kill three of them on the first round.

33
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:24,413
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, because you're all fighter, fighter, red mage, whatever.

34
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:31,762
Speaker 0: I either play fighter, fighter, red mage, white mage, because black mage actually kind of sucks and magic actually kind of sucks later in the game like that.

35
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:35,172
Speaker 0: Or fighter, black belt, red mage, white mage.

36
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:39,026
Speaker 0: Or fighter, fighter, black mage, white mage.

37
00:01:39,147 --> 00:01:40,935
Speaker 0: Any one of those combinations is awesome.

38
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:44,870
Speaker 1: I like to do fighter, black belt, black mage, white mage.

39
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,238
Speaker 1: I'm not a red mage fan.

40
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:51,901
Speaker 0: See, the thing is the red mage is pretty damn good because the mid-game is when you need all those spells.

41
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,931
Speaker 0: You need to be able to cast lit two a bunch.

42
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:58,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is would you rather at the end of the game would you rather have the red mage or the black mage?

43
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:06,082
Speaker 0: The black mage is completely useless at the end of the game because whatever his spells are they're nothing compared to the damage a fighter or a black belt does.

44
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:06,644
Speaker 0: That's right.

45
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:13,050
Speaker 0: So really the best party would be fighter, fighter, white, well, fighter, red mage, white mage, white mage.

46
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:14,154
Speaker 0: No.

47
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,620
Speaker 0: I beat the game with that party.

48
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:19,659
Speaker 1: Why don't you beat the game then with fighter, fighter, black belt, white mage?

49
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:24,997
Speaker 0: Because I want, you need black magic in the early to mid-game.

50
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,585
Speaker 0: Lit two on the boat is critical.

51
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:31,447
Speaker 1: Right, and what I'm saying is even though the black mage, the magic is weak in the end game, right?

52
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:38,415
Speaker 1: The black mage's black magic will be slightly better at the end game than the red mage's black magic.

53
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:41,872
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't matter because it's the difference at the end game.

54
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:45,832
Speaker 0: The red mage does more damage with his fucking sword than the black mage will ever do.

55
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:47,420
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

56
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,640
Speaker 0: Scott, I played the ever-living fuck out of Final Fantasy 1 when I was a kid.

57
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:54,087
Speaker 1: The red mage sword is not really that good.

58
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,796
Speaker 1: I've beaten it more than ten times from scratch.

59
00:02:57,016 --> 00:02:59,063
Speaker 0: In fact, you know who I give the fucking Masamune to?

60
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:01,353
Speaker 1: The white mage because you're...

61
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:03,160
Speaker 0: No, the white mage has Thor's hammer.

62
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,466
Speaker 0: The white mage doesn't attack anyway.

63
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:06,014
Speaker 1: I know that.

64
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:06,698
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to be...

65
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,646
Speaker 0: Give it to the thief.

66
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:10,709
Speaker 1: Yeah.

67
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:12,897
Speaker 1: Who uses the fucking thief at all?

68
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,853
Speaker 1: No, it's like we were arguing over here about like changing, right?

69
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:17,782
Speaker 1: It's like no one uses thief.

70
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:19,547
Speaker 1: Who uses thief?

71
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:21,071
Speaker 0: Nobody.

72
00:03:21,352 --> 00:03:27,653
Speaker 0: The first time I played the game, not knowing any better, I used the thief because I was like, "Oh, he can totally run away and I can avoid

73
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:28,014
Speaker 0: fights.".

74
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:29,179
Speaker 0: Then I didn't level up and then...

75
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,906
Speaker 1: The thief can't do anything.

76
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:34,120
Speaker 0: No, he can wield the... There's one weapon he can wield.

77
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:34,841
Speaker 1: Great.

78
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:38,213
Speaker 0: Anyway, that weapon you don't get it till the end of the game.

79
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:44,293
Speaker 0: Oh, he can cast some shitty like first and second level black magic when he's a ninja.

80
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:45,637
Speaker 1: Awesome.

81
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:46,801
Speaker 0: So, now I got a bike.

82
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:51,421
Speaker 0: Well, I ordered a bike and, you know, my bike got stolen a while ago, so just got to buy a new bike.

83
00:03:51,481 --> 00:04:02,084
Speaker 0: and I realize now buying a bike in the fall is kind of awesome because much like cars, higher-end bikes have model years and they're trying to get rid of the 2011 model.

84
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:03,992
Speaker 1: Well, you did the same thing with skis.

85
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:05,539
Speaker 0: Yes, I did and you know what?

86
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:08,892
Speaker 0: I spent half what I could have spent on skis.

87
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:09,615
Speaker 1: See, this is the thing.

88
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:14,032
Speaker 1: In the world, there are many seasonal goods such as fruits, right?

89
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:18,271
Speaker 1: But the problem with fruits is that they spoil, so you can only buy them in season.

90
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,180
Speaker 1: When they're out of season, you don't want to buy the fruit at all.

91
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,866
Speaker 0: Now, my skis do turn black and eventually rot.

92
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:24,409
Speaker 0: I... No, that doesn't happen.

93
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,063
Speaker 1: Right, so, but there are certain other things that also have seasons such as clothing and sporting goods, but...

94
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, how come no one has any foresight?

95
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:35,540
Speaker 0: How come every store is selling shorts at like 80% off around now?

96
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,020
Speaker 0: It's like, do they not understand that I can buy my shorts now and not buy them in the summer?

97
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,488
Speaker 0: Or do the majority of people not have such simple foresight?

98
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,560
Speaker 1: Well, it's not only that, but it's that next year, you know, people who actually care about clothes, the fashion will change.

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,012
Speaker 1: So, the shorts that, you know, so even if they got, they wanted to get the shorts now to save money, those shorts are no good for them next year.

100
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:57,253
Speaker 0: Oh, true.

101
00:04:57,273 --> 00:04:59,998
Speaker 0: No good for fashion-y people, but Walmart does this.

102
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:00,760
Speaker 1: Yeah.

103
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,003
Speaker 0: There's no fashion in Walmart.

104
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:03,765
Speaker 1: You'd be surprised.

105
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:04,867
Speaker 0: There's no fashion there.

106
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,353
Speaker 1: Anyway, you know, but sporting goods, right?

107
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,499
Speaker 1: They also have seasons.

108
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:10,060
Speaker 0: Now, here's the thing.

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,388
Speaker 1: So, if you want to buy skis in the winter, when people are skiing, you're going to pay a lot of money.

110
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:18,556
Speaker 0: The 2012 bikes are better overall than the 2011 bikes.

111
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:20,920
Speaker 1: By a very slim margin, that won't matter to you.

112
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,247
Speaker 0: The margin is not something I believe a human could perceive, especially this time around.

113
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:36,120
Speaker 0: So, and I test-wrote a whole bunch of bikes, and to not belabor the point, I used to always ride a 19-inch frame mountain bike, totally not suitable to the city.

114
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:44,917
Speaker 0: I got a 22-inch street bike, like a performance hybrid before, but I did not know what I needed, and that was the bike that was recommended.

115
00:05:44,957 --> 00:05:46,140
Speaker 0: It was pretty great for what it was.

116
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:59,700
Speaker 0: But having ridden street bikes for a while now, and now I know the deal with them, which is way different from all the biking I've ever known in my life, I knew what I wanted, and I test-drove a whole bunch of bikes, and I'm getting a pretty fucking awesome bike, I think.

117
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:00,999
Speaker 1: Eh, I'll just get stolen again.

118
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,860
Speaker 0: Eh, no, because I'm never going to park it outside.

119
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:03,978
Speaker 1: You're never going to use it.

120
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:09,840
Speaker 0: I'm going to use it a lot, but only for recreational biking, or biking to work, where I can just park it in my fucking office.

121
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:11,560
Speaker 1: Oh, you got a better office now.

122
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:11,973
Speaker 1: Yeah.

123
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:13,480
Speaker 1: Alright.

124
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:15,300
Speaker 0: So yeah, getting a bike.

125
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:16,439
Speaker 1: So, woman?

126
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:18,759
Speaker 0: Uh, it's kind of warm out.

127
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,339
Speaker 1: Not where I'm working.

128
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,960
Speaker 0: No, but the odyssey continues.

129
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,020
Speaker 1: So I'm sitting in his office, and the office is so freaking cold.

130
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,840
Speaker 1: How hot cold is it?

131
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,760
Speaker 1: I'm wearing my winter hat, and my hoodie, and I'm still cold.

132
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, and look, look, I got winter socks on, I'm still cold.

133
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,120
Speaker 0: Scott, you should file an HR complaint.

134
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,578
Speaker 1: We did, we talked to the HR guy.

135
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,500
Speaker 0: File a complaint, say you're not going to come into the office.

136
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,360
Speaker 1: My throat is like scratchy from being in the cold office.

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,540
Speaker 0: Tell him it's too cold, you have to work from home.

138
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,080
Speaker 1: I'm, you know, I don't know, actually I might legitimately be slightly sick from being in the cold office.

139
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,800
Speaker 0: Don't you get me sick.

140
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,500
Speaker 1: It's just scratchy throat.

141
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,100
Speaker 0: Because I kind of want to go to Wildwood this weekend if that is an option.

142
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:57,680
Speaker 1: I would also take that option.

143
00:06:58,522 --> 00:07:00,919
Speaker 1: There's nothing that heals cold like a warm beach.

144
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:02,616
Speaker 0: And some orangey.

145
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:06,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, we'll see, but it's like god damn it's cold.

146
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,740
Speaker 0: So this is an issue that comes up a lot.

147
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:17,280
Speaker 0: Many times in the tech world, a tech company will run afoul of some stupid ass law in some backwater country.

148
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,720
Speaker 0: And because they're an international company that cares about, you know, growth markets or emerging markets or whatever.

149
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:28,640
Speaker 0: They'll either cave in to this bullshit demand or they'll like partition things to people to handle it.

150
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm really hating this, right.

151
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,720
Speaker 1: This happens a lot where, you know, a company makes a product, but because they're an internet company that product goes to the whole world.

152
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:40,979
Speaker 1: And one country says, oh, your product breaks our law in our country so you have to change it.

153
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:50,880
Speaker 1: So suddenly you got the whole, the rest of the world that doesn't have this stupid law is suffering with a shittier product because they have to change it for this one country that they care about.

154
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:55,260
Speaker 1: Or what happens is they'll start diversifying and there'll be two versions of the product.

155
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,500
Speaker 1: You know, the company is suffering because they had to spend more money maintaining multiple versions.

156
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,280
Speaker 0: The way the internet works, Google is a big example of this.

157
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,880
Speaker 0: So they have Google, you know, Korea Google and Germany Google and France Google.

158
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,000
Speaker 0: Those Google portals follow all the rules of every country they're in because they do whatever business they do in that country.

159
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:18,000
Speaker 0: But they don't ever compromise on the functionality of the real Google.

160
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,964
Speaker 0: Which it's interesting that the

161
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:20,425
Speaker 0: U.S.,

162
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:28,260
Speaker 0: despite all the bullshit we go through, is pretty much the only country I trust with any internet anything when it comes to free speech of any kind.

163
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,700
Speaker 0: Well, considering most of the internet is here anyway.

164
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,020
Speaker 1: Well, at least the free speech, but not when it comes, right.

165
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:47,040
Speaker 1: But it's weird because like if it's a straight up free speech issue, like someone has a political website or something, you'll always win in the U.S But they will allow people to have chilling effects via other avenues.

166
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,700
Speaker 1: You can use intellectual property laws to chill free speech because it's not viewed as a free speech issue.

167
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:56,299
Speaker 1: But if you can make it a free speech issue, you can win.

168
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,135
Speaker 0: But anyway, tonight's backwater country is worst Korea.

169
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:03,820
Speaker 0: South Korea has a law.

170
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,560
Speaker 1: Well, it's the less worst Korea.

171
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:08,331
Speaker 0: Scott, this is a meme you're obviously unaware of.

172
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:10,560
Speaker 0: North Korea is best Korea.

173
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:11,542
Speaker 1: Okay.

174
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:13,088
Speaker 1: Great.

175
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:16,020
Speaker 1: Like Rarity's best pony?

176
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:17,578
Speaker 0: Rarity is pretty good.

177
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,630
Speaker 1: Sure.

178
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:20,479
Speaker 1: Like North Korea.

179
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:30,239
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Korea has this stupid law that has to do with defamation that takes effect on, I believe, April 1st.

180
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:34,860
Speaker 0: For any site above a certain number of unique visitors per day.

181
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:35,956
Speaker 0: And the deal is...

182
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,980
Speaker 1: At least they're limiting it that way and not imposing it on every site period.

183
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,160
Speaker 0: But the deal is they require anyone who's commenting to post their real name and their national ID card number.

184
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,618
Speaker 0: Now, I gotta back up a little bit here.

185
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:49,092
Speaker 0: I've run afoul of this before.

186
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:50,020
Speaker 0: So has Scott.

187
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:56,340
Speaker 0: In fact, back at RIT, we liked to play weird online games and many of them happen to be from Korea.

188
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, because when you're in college, you learn about all this weird shit.

189
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,680
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, we know that the rest of the world has a lot of cool things that we want.

190
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,220
Speaker 1: Especially, you know, the Asian world and Japan and South Korea.

191
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,360
Speaker 1: And, you know, they have lots of cool things and games that we want that we can't get.

192
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,360
Speaker 1: So we had some friends who would go out of their way to get these things and they tried to play Korean MMOs.

193
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:21,500
Speaker 1: And in order to do so, you need a Korean national ID number, which is a social security number.

194
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,500
Speaker 0: Now, here's the fucked up part.

195
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,040
Speaker 0: I'm gonna grossly generalize, but basically it's like the equivalent of a social security number.

196
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,919
Speaker 0: And if you're a Korean citizen, you've got one.

197
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,400
Speaker 0: There's data coded into the number.

198
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,720
Speaker 0: For example, you can determine from a number if someone is male or female.

199
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,180
Speaker 0: Many Korean online games require this number to even make an account.

200
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:48,540
Speaker 0: So it would be the equivalent of you have to publicly tie your SSN to your World of Warcraft account with your real name or you cannot play.

201
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:50,869
Speaker 1: And then some of the games went even further.

202
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,880
Speaker 1: is you could not play as the gender that you were not.

203
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,214
Speaker 1: So if you're a dude, you have to play as a dude.

204
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:57,160
Speaker 1: You can't be a girl.

205
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,319
Speaker 0: This is because Korea is kind of fucked up.

206
00:10:59,840 --> 00:10:59,941
Speaker 1: Right.

207
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,500
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, South Korea is still pretty cool overall.

208
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:06,820
Speaker 1: But, you know, much like the UK, which has scary police state cameras everywhere.

209
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,580
Speaker 0: Or Australia, which if you look at just their internet law is a fascist state.

210
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:13,578
Speaker 0: But the rest of their law is pretty...

211
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,080
Speaker 1: Also video game censorship, right?

212
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:27,580
Speaker 1: You know, Korea, while we think it's all pretty cool with their, you know, GGG and their Starcraft has plenty of their share of, you know, fucked up shit.

213
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,320
Speaker 1: So we have fucked up airports and stuff like that.

214
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:37,160
Speaker 0: And I just point out, as always, Google is doing the best thing they can do because they have a real business presence in Korea that they can't extricate themselves from.

215
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,017
Speaker 0: They do stuff there.

216
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:44,480
Speaker 0: So they're fully compliant with Korean law only on the tiny Korean version of Google and YouTube.

217
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:54,700
Speaker 0: And anyone in Korea can just post a video to regular YouTube where all the normal internet citizens live and they don't have to deal with this BS.

218
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:57,311
Speaker 1: But normal YouTube is in English.

219
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,420
Speaker 1: if they don't speak it, they're in trouble.

220
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,361
Speaker 0: Yeah.

221
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:12,560
Speaker 0: This is a broader problem that really I'm feeling more and more that the US internet in English is in some ways, like, surprisingly partitioned from the rest of the world's internet.

222
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:24,860
Speaker 0: Just for the fact that most countries have these weird laws and these other services that comply with these laws, but kind of the consensus reality is in English, mostly hosted in the US.

223
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:25,861
Speaker 1: Yeah.

224
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:27,089
Speaker 1: I think it's sort of like it's.

225
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:28,680
Speaker 1: this thing goes both ways, right?

226
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,260
Speaker 1: On the one hand, you know, you have the, you know, you want to operate worldwide.

227
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,020
Speaker 1: One country's laws suddenly affect you everywhere.

228
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, you're the reverse, which is I'm not in your country.

229
00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:38,857
Speaker 1: Screw you.

230
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,860
Speaker 1: Like VLC is hosted on some servers in France where it's okay.

231
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,380
Speaker 0: I don't want a global regulatory body because I don't trust the majority of countries, let alone the majority of people.

232
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:57,400
Speaker 1: I don't think there's, I think what we need is a non-country related regulatory body, an internet government that is the government of the internet.

233
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,305
Speaker 0: Now I agree in principle, Scott.

234
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:05,240
Speaker 0: I agree that the internet as a culture, as an entity should be a politically distinct unit.

235
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:10,900
Speaker 1: And when that internet government is formed, it would immediately declare war against anyone who did not comply.

236
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,580
Speaker 1: So China, Korea, Australia.

237
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,760
Speaker 0: How the fuck do we have an internet election to see who is president of the internet?

238
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,020
Speaker 1: If this was a fictional novel of the cyberpunk genre, it would go something along these lines.

239
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,259
Speaker 0: A guy with a nuke in his motorcycle.

240
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,281
Speaker 1: No.

241
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:37,000
Speaker 1: Some guy wins a mega lottery or something, or maybe he starts some company and makes $20.

242
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,472
Speaker 0: And lives in space?

243
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:37,800
Speaker 0: Or Antarctica?

244
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Speaker 1: And he buys, with that money eventually, Cisco, AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint.

245
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,500
Speaker 0: Scott, I think there's a better way to go about it.

246
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,292
Speaker 0: I wrote, I don't have it anymore.

247
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:50,500
Speaker 0: It's on that hard drive.

248
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,740
Speaker 0: But in high school, I wrote a short fiction, a science fiction.

249
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,400
Speaker 1: A cyberpunk internet government fiction?

250
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:07,360
Speaker 0: No, so the opening scene was basically one day, I think I've said this on the show before, at like 11.08, or no, it was like right during morning rush hour in every major city in the world.

251
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,480
Speaker 1: 1990, whatever, the end day.

252
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was set in 20-something-something.

253
00:14:11,256 --> 00:14:11,839
Speaker 0: 20X, XCX.

254
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:12,839
Speaker 1: It wasn't the end day?

255
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,767
Speaker 0: No, October whatever, 1997.

256
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,380
Speaker 0: I marched in a football game parade that day.

257
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:28,700
Speaker 0: Anyway, on that morning, suddenly at every major intersection in every major city in the world, Yeah, a shopping cart full of gallon jugs and milk got shoved into the intersection.

258
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Speaker 0: And then a missive that was cryptographically signed came from the internet declaring sovereignty.

259
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:45,880
Speaker 0: And then there was a whole cyber war following, and eventually the internet got a distributed anonymous seat, kind of like L in the first part of Death Note at the UN.

260
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:53,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, however, that requires punk kids like 4chaners to organize cohesively.

261
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,145
Speaker 1: And be in greater numbers.

262
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:58,519
Speaker 1: The problem is the internet makes everything look bigger than it really is.

263
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,720
Speaker 0: But at the same time, so does terrorism.

264
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:01,779
Speaker 1: It sure does.

265
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,860
Speaker 0: And I like the idea of prankful terrorism.

266
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:07,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, not killing people's good.

267
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:15,586
Speaker 0: Like one way anonymous, not anonymous, but something like anonymous, and we say lowercase anonymous could start something like this, would be to say, have a symbol.

268
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:17,959
Speaker 0: that's fairly simple to make, that's generally agreed upon.

269
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,078
Speaker 1: They've got like a hundred of them.

270
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,479
Speaker 0: And then, yeah, but you need one that's generally agreed upon.

271
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,140
Speaker 0: That isn't the troll face, fucking V-Mass.

272
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:28,000
Speaker 0: And one day it just starts getting graffitied fucking everywhere.

273
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:29,340
Speaker 1: Alright, great.

274
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,477
Speaker 1: Anyway.

275
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,860
Speaker 1: Vandalism, that'll help.

276
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it will in that it'll scare people a little bit.

277
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,591
Speaker 0: Anyway, we digress.

278
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:35,580
Speaker 0: That's a show topic.

279
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:35,911
Speaker 0: Sure.

280
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,911
Speaker 0: But you know what, Korea?

281
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:37,499
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

282
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:38,280
Speaker 0: That's right.

283
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,679
Speaker 0: That's the moral of the story.

284
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:40,920
Speaker 1: So check out this, right?

285
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,000
Speaker 1: So some researchers, and thankfully I guess it was researchers depending on who you are, right?

286
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,300
Speaker 1: They bought a bunch of domains, which is perfectly okay.

287
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,700
Speaker 1: You can buy domains if you want.

288
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,320
Speaker 1: But they bought domains that were slight misspellings of popular domains, right?

289
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,160
Speaker 0: So instead of experts exchange, it was experts exchange.

290
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,760
Speaker 1: That's exactly the same as spelling.

291
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,148
Speaker 0: I know.

292
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,699
Speaker 1: Instead of frontrowcrew.com, it was frontrowcraw.com, right?

293
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,079
Speaker 0: Well, the other day I accidentally typed YouTube.

294
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:09,746
Speaker 1: Yeah.

295
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:10,976
Speaker 0: And you know what I went to?

296
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,138
Speaker 0: The same thing, no.

297
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:12,636
Speaker 0: No.

298
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,900
Speaker 0: I went to horrible malware site.

299
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,620
Speaker 1: Oh, because Google actually owns a lot of misspellings.

300
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they don't own all of them.

301
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,040
Speaker 0: They don't own YouTube.

302
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:28,560
Speaker 1: So what they did is something that a lot of campers and squatters of misspellings don't do, is they actually set stuff up on those servers.

303
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,700
Speaker 1: And what they set up was not websites.

304
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,620
Speaker 1: Who wants websites?

305
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:34,240
Speaker 1: They set up email servers.

306
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:44,800
Speaker 1: So they pointed the MX records of all these misspelled domains at a mail server and started collecting mail, email, where the person sending the email mistyped the domain.

307
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:52,359
Speaker 1: So for example, maybe somebody accidentally sent an email that was meant for me to me at frontrowcraw.com.

308
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:55,780
Speaker 1: And this guy owned the domain and got it on his mail servers.

309
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,219
Speaker 1: Now you thought you were emailing me, but you emailed this other guy.

310
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,940
Speaker 0: Now what's interesting is that I don't honestly believe that there should be any legal problem with doing this.

311
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:06,498
Speaker 1: Oh, there isn't.

312
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:06,890
Speaker 1: Yeah.

313
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:11,880
Speaker 1: I don't think there is, but it is a major security vulnerability.

314
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,060
Speaker 1: For example, right?

315
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,119
Speaker 1: Some of the examples they gave her like IBM, where people would do like subdomains.

316
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:24,117
Speaker 1: So what would happen is instead of sending an email to like us.ibm.com, it would go to usibm.com.

317
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:30,880
Speaker 1: So what happens is a lot of people are dumb and they send things in email that they shouldn't.

318
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,639
Speaker 0: Now there's two ways around this.

319
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,280
Speaker 0: One, the fuck are you doing ever typing an email address?

320
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,640
Speaker 0: Yes, that's true.

321
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,800
Speaker 0: Seriously, what the fuck are you ever going to... If you're typing an email address, you've already done something wrong.

322
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,080
Speaker 1: Right.

323
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:49,600
Speaker 1: Also, but I mean, what if, say for example, I click a mail to or a contact form and the guy who coded the contact form mistyped the email address.

324
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,978
Speaker 0: Well, then that's point two.

325
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:51,440
Speaker 0: Right.

326
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,920
Speaker 0: If someone else caused the problem, the fuck are you doing sending anything important that could fuck you in an email?

327
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,580
Speaker 1: That's definitely the big problem.

328
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,540
Speaker 0: But for example... I work for broker dealers.

329
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,618
Speaker 0: If you mailed a password and a credential in the same email... What the fuck?

330
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,959
Speaker 0: Let alone a password in the same email, you're fired.

331
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:23,460
Speaker 1: What if you sign up for Steam or something like Amazon and you, when you're signing up, put in the wrong email and now that signup mail that lets the person get into the account is going to some other domain.

332
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,000
Speaker 1: Now that guy can reset the password on your account and he's got your account.

333
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,180
Speaker 0: Now luckily, most of those sites require you to confirm the email address before you can do anything.

334
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:30,521
Speaker 1: Right.

335
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,519
Speaker 1: So the guy confirms it because he gets the original email.

336
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:33,019
Speaker 0: Yep.

337
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,600
Speaker 1: Because you typed it wrong on registration.

338
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,939
Speaker 0: Not so lucky now, is it?

339
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:45,340
Speaker 0: Now if he's really evil, he then forwards on a confirmation to you and as a pastor, it's all the mail that you think you're, that you should be getting, you really are getting.

340
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,360
Speaker 0: So he's transparently in your business, ready to take your credit card as soon as you've added it.

341
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:49,640
Speaker 1: Yep.

342
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,800
Speaker 1: So now, you know, obviously if you're smart like us, this isn't going to hurt you because why are you typing an email?

343
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,855
Speaker 1: Why are you sending something, right?

344
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,080
Speaker 1: But if you're a gigantic mega corporation with thousands of employees, you can't keep them all from being dumb.

345
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:07,480
Speaker 1: So some things you can do, for example, you know that your company is front row crew.

346
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:20,439
Speaker 1: So you in your local DNS records at your company, you prevent employees from sending emails to the common misspellings of front row crew by directing the IP or, you know, something like that.

347
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,206
Speaker 1: But that only goes so far.

348
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:31,500
Speaker 1: Stupidity can still beat you and people, you know, from other companies sending email to your company can still, you know, screw up.

349
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:42,479
Speaker 0: One difference here is that with a post office, there's at some point a human being looks at the envelope and goes, wait a minute, this guy clearly meant Shady Lane, not Shady Loo.

350
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:45,410
Speaker 1: That's only if the computer can't read it.

351
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:54,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time, you also can't like, it's not the other way, you put up a cardboard house next to the real house with the misspelling on the street.

352
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:57,760
Speaker 0: It's like Shady Power Book.

353
00:19:59,609 --> 00:19:59,811
Speaker 1: Yeah.

354
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,080
Speaker 1: Power Books are sure are shady.

355
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,503
Speaker 0: I don't know what to do about the problem.

356
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:10,940
Speaker 0: I mean, you could do some sort of exchange identity trust where, kind of like how, kind of like how, not to talk about the technical details of it, because this is just the news, not a show.

357
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:20,240
Speaker 0: When in Firefox, you're typing in a URL and there's a certificate for that domain, it shows up in green or not green, depending on whether or not.

358
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,507
Speaker 0: It's a real simple answer.

359
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:23,920
Speaker 1: As if you just encrypted the emails.

360
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,100
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, but that is beyond the vast majority of humans.

361
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:29,257
Speaker 1: Like PGP.

362
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:36,500
Speaker 0: We have had relatively trivial identity trust and encryption integrated into mail fairly readily.

363
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:42,080
Speaker 1: If you really care and you're willing to put forth a little bit of effort.

364
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,861
Speaker 0: It's so little.

365
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:44,003
Speaker 0: Dude, you want to email Wil Wheaton?

366
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:46,769
Speaker 0: A lot of you might have ever tried to email him in the past.

367
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:47,190
Speaker 0: You know what?

368
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:49,535
Speaker 0: Go to his website, there's his public key.

369
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:52,240
Speaker 0: He won't read email that isn't at least signed.

370
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:53,022
Speaker 1: Yeah.

371
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:58,352
Speaker 1: So if you want to send an email and encrypt it properly and maybe get Wil Wheaton to read it, right?

372
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:02,520
Speaker 1: Go and get a public key with PGP and there's a Firefox plugin.

373
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,823
Speaker 1: I don't know if it still exists.

374
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:07,796
Speaker 1: It used to exist called Fire PGP and it would add PGP to your Gmail.

375
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,460
Speaker 1: And basically all you do is when you want to send a Gmail to someone, you use, you push a few buttons extra when sending the email and when receiving the email.

376
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,590
Speaker 1: And it'll be so encrypted, no government on earth can read it.

377
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,620
Speaker 1: And only the person you are sending it to will be able to read it.

378
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,380
Speaker 1: And if you type the email address wrong, the person who gets it, that's the wrong person, won't be able to read anything.

379
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,122
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

380
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:33,760
Speaker 0: You need the people you're sending the mail to to also use the same thing.

381
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:35,420
Speaker 0: And this is why this is impossible.

382
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,101
Speaker 1: That's right.

383
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:40,216
Speaker 1: But if you actually care and you coordinate with people, you can use this.

384
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:41,220
Speaker 1: I've used it in the past.

385
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,601
Speaker 0: Yep.

386
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:46,618
Speaker 0: But I warn you, it's not going to happen on any reasonable scale in the next 40 years.

387
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:49,582
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm going to.

388
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:49,883
Speaker 1: I'm going to.

389
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:56,540
Speaker 1: I'm working on ways to to make encryption happen without the user having to do as much key copying and stuff.

390
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:04,585
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

391
00:22:04,645 --> 00:22:05,410
Speaker 0: What do you got for me?

392
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,617
Speaker 1: I don't know if I've talked about this on the show before.

393
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:11,570
Speaker 1: I feel like I have, but there has been some changes to this department.

394
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:16,790
Speaker 1: So I think it is OK to mention it and do it again, even though it may have been discussed in the past.

395
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:17,613
Speaker 1: All right.

396
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:20,670
Speaker 1: There is a Web site called If This Then That.

397
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,318
Speaker 1: And it's actually the URL is IF.

398
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:26,570
Speaker 0: So if we've talked about on the show, I've been using it for a while.

399
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:27,355
Speaker 0: TTT.

400
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:28,909
Speaker 1: So if this then that.

401
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:33,910
Speaker 0: I'm going to stop using it because everything I thought that would be cool to do with it has not turned out the way I wanted.

402
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,490
Speaker 1: Nearly all my stuff's working out pretty good and has been working pretty good for a long time.

403
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:44,530
Speaker 0: I was mostly using it to capture links people tweeted of people I followed or things that people sent to me to then like have thing of the day fodder.

404
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:46,644
Speaker 0: But it caused so much bullshit.

405
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:47,369
Speaker 0: It wasn't even worth it.

406
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,920
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's because you set it up to catch so much bullshit like.

407
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,430
Speaker 1: I'm using it to like basically forward things between services.

408
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:54,830
Speaker 1: Right.

409
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:59,244
Speaker 1: So if I post a photo to Flickr, it'll tweet it.

410
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:01,130
Speaker 1: Or if I, you know, post.

411
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:08,210
Speaker 0: See, I can't do that because the way I post photos is once a month, I take my like four hundred photos and upload them all at once to Flickr.

412
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:12,390
Speaker 1: You just had to configure it to, you know, to match your personal whatever.

413
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:20,570
Speaker 0: The amount of configuration it takes to match what I want, what I do normally is more work and effort and fiddly bullshit than just do it.

414
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,730
Speaker 1: It's a lot less effort than coding it, that's for sure.

415
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,612
Speaker 0: That is true.

416
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:26,159
Speaker 0: But I have not found a use for it.

417
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:29,630
Speaker 0: that makes me like would make me mourn it disappearing.

418
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:31,376
Speaker 1: I got a lot of uses for it.

419
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:35,510
Speaker 1: The primary thing I use it for a lot is basically between Delicious and Twitter.

420
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,150
Speaker 1: Right.

421
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:37,115
Speaker 1: I got a lot going on.

422
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:40,590
Speaker 1: So like if I favorite something on Twitter and there's a link in it, it automatically gets delicious.

423
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:42,214
Speaker 1: That's really useful.

424
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,250
Speaker 1: But anyway, so that's what this site does.

425
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:49,205
Speaker 1: But the reason it's a thing of the day is because now it is no longer invite only.

426
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:50,029
Speaker 1: You can just sign up.

427
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:50,744
Speaker 1: Ho ho.

428
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,390
Speaker 1: Not only that, but not only can you just sign up, but they remove the limits on it.

429
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,090
Speaker 1: So you can just make as many tasks as you want.

430
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:00,020
Speaker 1: It used to be there like a limit of how many you could have.

431
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,970
Speaker 1: now you can have infinity jillion.

432
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:04,361
Speaker 0: If my if this, then that updates.

433
00:24:04,462 --> 00:24:04,965
Speaker 0: update my.

434
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:05,890
Speaker 0: if this, then that.

435
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:06,414
Speaker 1: Yep.

436
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:07,789
Speaker 1: And they also keep adding more.

437
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:09,092
Speaker 1: I don't know.

438
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:09,433
Speaker 1: They keep.

439
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,059
Speaker 1: you can make loops with it.

440
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,709
Speaker 1: You can do Twitter, Facebook, Facebook, Twitter and have to get to get to get to get to get to.

441
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,250
Speaker 1: And you're basically you'll hit the API limit on both of them and then you're done.

442
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:27,290
Speaker 1: But yeah, this site, I imagine many useful for many people who use a lot of different Internet services and want them to all hook up.

443
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:39,259
Speaker 1: You know, like if you're the kind of person who has a Twitter and a Facebook and you only really use one of them But you kind of want the stuff posted on the other one Then this is for you Has a lot of weird stuff like.

444
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,057
Speaker 1: it can do emails SMS is Poster is oh, it's a cool thing.

445
00:24:43,077 --> 00:24:44,060
Speaker 0: Don't get me wrong.

446
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:46,970
Speaker 0: I just I do think we've talked about this before.

447
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,322
Speaker 1: I think we have but you know, it's it's worth.

448
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:50,829
Speaker 0: so you've opened a door.

449
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:52,908
Speaker 1: What door did I open?

450
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:58,169
Speaker 0: So I can repeat a thing of the day if I think it warrants discussion, I don't think it was a thing of the day.

451
00:24:58,189 --> 00:25:02,378
Speaker 1: I Think it may have been discussed But I do not believe it was thing of the day.

452
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:08,385
Speaker 0: so I can take all my previous things of the day and count them As news is going forward if they're new which they're not.

453
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:09,550
Speaker 0: but this is new.

454
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:15,209
Speaker 1: It is new because it is now open to the public with no invite, but shouldn't that be news?

455
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:18,607
Speaker 1: No, because it's a cool thing.

456
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:21,281
Speaker 0: You can't talk about anything cool in the news.

457
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:23,310
Speaker 1: I didn't have anything cool to talk about.

458
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:27,297
Speaker 0: so This has happened before my thing of the day.

459
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:31,108
Speaker 0: watch this video and the whole time just remember just remember.

460
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:31,870
Speaker 0: very clearly.

461
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:36,348
Speaker 0: these people Do not realize what they do.

462
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:37,674
Speaker 1: Who are these people?

463
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,983
Speaker 0: so some high school football game, whatever.

464
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:41,770
Speaker 0: someone had a big sign.

465
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,797
Speaker 0: You know how you trash talk right like it.

466
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:44,540
Speaker 0: RIT hockey.

467
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:52,650
Speaker 0: after we scored the first goal against any team Some brave man would hang a got goalie sign behind the opposition's goal.

468
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:59,110
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, at one point a goalie turned around after seeing this saw it and started crying.

469
00:25:59,512 --> 00:25:59,873
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

470
00:26:00,155 --> 00:26:03,210
Speaker 0: There's more to that story, but he was crying and had to be taken off the ice.

471
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:05,619
Speaker 1: We went through like three or four goalies in that game.

472
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:06,744
Speaker 0: That was a pretty went

473
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:08,932
Speaker 1: through goalies like rim goes to me while

474
00:26:08,952 --> 00:26:18,220
Speaker 0: I have a lot of respect for that Newman goalie because when the 23rd goal got my him he did not cry and When the 24th one went through well the game was over by then so

475
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,213
Speaker 1: He was not any less

476
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:20,393
Speaker 0: score.

477
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:26,290
Speaker 0: So someone hung one of those and what they hung was a sign that said you mad, bro.

478
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:28,676
Speaker 1: Now excellent signage.

479
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:29,438
Speaker 0: We're on the internet.

480
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,802
Speaker 0: You know what that means.

481
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:32,226
Speaker 0: I know what that means.

482
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,670
Speaker 0: Everyone knows what that means.

483
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:44,650
Speaker 0: These people think that it is clearly racist due to the mentioning of bro Which clearly refers to the African American player on the other team, right?

484
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:48,343
Speaker 0: It's really guys like if you never heard of the internet like.

485
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:49,527
Speaker 1: well, really it's this.

486
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:50,330
Speaker 1: you know what this is.

487
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:51,930
Speaker 1: This is the niggard Lee situation.

488
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:58,510
Speaker 1: Right is to where one person thinks a word means one thing and another person thinks the word means another thing.

489
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:10,770
Speaker 0: This however is beyond that because niggard Lee at least is a word that is not used commonly, but this is more like Jive talk almost like you mad bro is something on the internet that everyone knows what it means.

490
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,997
Speaker 0: And yet these people are so out of touch

491
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:17,516
Speaker 1: that not only well actually what it is is that most people are so out of touch but not

492
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:24,190
Speaker 0: only do they not like Even think to try to figure out if there's anything else behind it or not only does any no one tell them no

493
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:26,610
Speaker 1: If they were smart enough to do that, they would already know what it means.

494
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:34,090
Speaker 0: No kids like dad that this is just something on the internet But that they immediately assume it's racist and raise a brouhaha.

495
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:37,769
Speaker 1: Well, I think it also was because this happened to be used right?

496
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:44,950
Speaker 1: So the you mad bro was hung by a predominantly white school after a game against a predominantly not white school.

497
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:53,630
Speaker 0: But to me bro does not indicate African-american bro, if anything indicates college brag our pink shirted ass.

498
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,019
Speaker 1: yeah, you know, this is you know a lot

499
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,300
Speaker 0: of

500
00:27:57,011 --> 00:28:25,350
Speaker 1: racism sexism whatever accusations Not all obviously but many these days are due to a person saying something Not having any intent at least at that time of racism sexism, you know You know any sort of prejudice or discrimination, you know intent whatsoever, but using a word choice that is Interpreted improperly by the other people's thus resulting in you know, but I'm thinking

501
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:32,504
Speaker 0: The one thing in this case It really just highlights the severe cultural divide between internet people

502
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,727
Speaker 1: on the internet and people aren't

503
00:28:33,908 --> 00:28:34,610
Speaker 0: and everybody else.

504
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,299
Speaker 1: It's about 50 years difference now.

505
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,657
Speaker 0: this happened once before Not that long ago on FARC.

506
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,530
Speaker 0: There was a big funny article about it, but basically a pool got shot down.

507
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,938
Speaker 0: I think it was because someone pooped in it.

508
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:47,548
Speaker 1: This wasn't the one where people died in it.

509
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:48,292
Speaker 0: No No, it wasn't.

510
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:49,761
Speaker 0: I don't even know what happened with that pool.

511
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:51,310
Speaker 0: I've been waiting for the follow-up article.

512
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:54,118
Speaker 0: But so pool got shut down for whatever reason.

513
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:57,748
Speaker 0: so someone hung the pools closed sign at the pool.

514
00:28:57,848 --> 00:29:08,675
Speaker 0: Nice and Immediately the whole community was outraged at this racist caricature and this racist sign telling black people they can't swim in the community Pool, why is pools closed?

515
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,417
Speaker 1: racist?

516
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:16,948
Speaker 0: because the guy in the pools closed canonical picture has an afro And I guess that is the closest link they've got.

517
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:18,629
Speaker 1: That's true.

518
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:26,967
Speaker 0: It is true that the man depicted in the meme for pools closed Happens to be an african-american who happens to have a pretty bitchin afro.

519
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:29,354
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know.

520
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:33,189
Speaker 0: I I'm always a little not closed the pool I don't know.

521
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:40,040
Speaker 0: I'm always amused when stuff like this happens because I almost just want to go these people and be like Let me show you a world.

522
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:40,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

523
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:44,633
Speaker 1: It'd be like Willy Wonka We almost need like internet classes Like maybe that's.

524
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:45,958
Speaker 1: maybe that should be a show.

525
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:49,070
Speaker 1: that's odd network television like welcome to the internet.

526
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,570
Speaker 0: They do things like that, but the people who do those shows don't know either.

527
00:29:52,852 --> 00:30:00,203
Speaker 0: Those are the shows where above The woman will stand there and be like does your child speak in code to hide things from you?

528
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:04,956
Speaker 0: acronyms like L. O. L. or R.O.M.L.M.A.O.

529
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,563
Speaker 0: which clearly has communist underpinnings, right?

530
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:17,629
Speaker 1: I think the other thing is there are shows on TV I've seen for like a few seconds here and there, you know while you're in like a Restaurant that has a TV where it's like all they do is show funny YouTube videos on a TV.

531
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:21,323
Speaker 1: Because for people who don't have YouTube right or don't know how to use it.

532
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:23,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz everyone has YouTube, right?

533
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:26,159
Speaker 1: And I think that you know those shows are.

534
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:29,290
Speaker 1: just the problem with them is that they're limited, right?

535
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,370
Speaker 1: They can't take you that far down the rabbit hole.

536
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,021
Speaker 1: They can just basically do America's funniest home video.

537
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,150
Speaker 0: you realize know you're taking any submission.

538
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:38,590
Speaker 0: No, your meme does a good job of this.

539
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,870
Speaker 1: The thing is anyone who knows what that should be the show it should be know your meme.

540
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,715
Speaker 1: It should be on time.

541
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:43,640
Speaker 1: television thing is.

542
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:52,190
Speaker 1: everyone who knows what know your meme is Doesn't need know your meme, but that's exactly what if know your meme was a TV show that was on prime time.

543
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:53,296
Speaker 0: So have you ever watched?

544
00:30:53,336 --> 00:31:05,908
Speaker 0: know your meme because the problem with life only The problem with anyone is that if you don't understand the proper nouns I'm going to read for you what one of those sounds like to someone who doesn't already know the deal.

545
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:10,360
Speaker 0: All right I'm just gonna read Jabberwocky because it's just gibberish.

546
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,070
Speaker 1: Okay, but people have no idea what any of this stuff.

547
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,017
Speaker 1: But as I'm saying is you could I could.

548
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:21,398
Speaker 1: I could definitely make a show that taught normal people The ways of the internet if they watch.

549
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:25,030
Speaker 0: so I have a second thing of the day now, so I gotta find the picture again.

550
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,034
Speaker 0: I'll find it and link to it.

551
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:29,530
Speaker 0: You know the tea party right and all their right-wing shenanigans.

552
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:40,260
Speaker 0: Well some enterprising young man made a bunch of signs and internet ads that say lowercase T No, no, no, no politics.

553
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:47,410
Speaker 0: Got you bitter and a picture of a lemon Says join the lemon party the party dot org.

554
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:51,030
Speaker 0: I feel like that is the first step.

555
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:53,864
Speaker 1: I salute that man and give him an internet medal.

556
00:31:53,884 --> 00:31:57,930
Speaker 1: if there was an internet government He would receive the second best thing to be.

557
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:04,737
Speaker 0: I want to print like a hundred of these things out in color and just put them around New York City He wouldn't get the Internet Medal of Honor.

558
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,664
Speaker 1: He would just get the internet second.

559
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,230
Speaker 1: Not quite the Medal of Honor.

560
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:11,901
Speaker 0: He gets the Silver Star.

561
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:18,490
Speaker 1: yeah, whatever it is For Glorious service in name of the Internet.

562
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:22,341
Speaker 1: So very briefly in the meta moment.

563
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:23,345
Speaker 0: We were packs.

564
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:24,630

566

567
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:40,170
Speaker 0: I'll finish it as soon as I can because The worst webcomic contest is ending soon.

569
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:57,150

570
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,928
Speaker 1: Factoring will be entirely subjective on the part of us.

586
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:59,270
Speaker 1: It started with an entertaining dispute for the listeners.

587
00:33:59,431 --> 00:34:03,778
Speaker 0: It started when I said innocently so Scott What should we do the Monday show on?

591
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,922
Speaker 1: I don't even remember this show.

592
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:21,545
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

593
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:22,909
Speaker 1: I don't remember most of the shows.

594
00:34:24,254 --> 00:34:25,188
Speaker 1: That doesn't mean anything.

595
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:29,063
Speaker 0: So I thought I'd tackle a couple of specific problems that I realized.

596
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:35,248
Speaker 0: the majority of people out there listening Even techies have no idea how to use like no hop or screen.

597
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:38,210
Speaker 0: But Scott didn't want to do it cuz he's a big baby.

598
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:48,504
Speaker 1: No, it's because if you're gonna do a show, you know teaching specific details of terminal commands It's really a pain in the ass to do without visually showing someone.

599
00:34:48,643 --> 00:34:50,552
Speaker 0: now, you know, for example No hop.

600
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:55,730
Speaker 0: ever have the problem punk kids where you want to run a program from the command line.

601
00:34:56,071 --> 00:35:07,810
Speaker 0: But then like you log out or you close the terminal or something and it dies because the terminal died That's because the terminal sent a hangup signal that shut down the process because the process you started was tied to the terminal you opened.

602
00:35:08,111 --> 00:35:14,391
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you SSH somewhere you you run like a gigantic G on zip and then you you log out and then the GM zip Stops.

603
00:35:15,134 --> 00:35:19,850
Speaker 0: so you might think oh I put it into the background with the ampersand now still tied to the terminal.

604
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:24,008
Speaker 0: No, yeah, either that the only real good ways around this is one.

605
00:35:24,108 --> 00:35:25,569
Speaker 0: no hop No hop is magic.

606
00:35:26,072 --> 00:35:30,430
Speaker 0: You just type whatever you wanted to type and you put an ampersand put in the background like before.

607
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:35,152
Speaker 0: But in the beginning before your command you just type no hop You.

608
00:35:35,172 --> 00:35:38,890
Speaker 1: the thing is those commands or you type something in the beginning you can never remember like the time command.

609
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:44,109
Speaker 0: You can never remember know how because the terminal hangs up on whatever bullshit you're trying to do.

610
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:46,537
Speaker 0: No, hop says no hang up.

611
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:48,022
Speaker 0: It can't be hung up on.

612
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,270
Speaker 0: it'll run to the end no matter what someone kills it.

613
00:35:50,571 --> 00:35:52,135
Speaker 1: Okay, but still right.

614
00:35:52,175 --> 00:35:55,706
Speaker 1: This is not helping people who haven't who are not terminal experts in any way.

615
00:35:55,726 --> 00:35:57,190
Speaker 1: this terminal expert already knows that.

616
00:35:57,692 --> 00:36:01,949
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that at least one person is going to email us saying that really helped me.

617
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:06,596
Speaker 1: Dude, if you if you need help with those sorts of things I'll give you five bucks.

618
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:08,806
Speaker 0: go to email Scott and tell him that this helped you.

619
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:14,890
Speaker 1: go to Google Not really go to Google and search for like Linux terminal tutorial commit unique.

620
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:18,682
Speaker 0: That's not gonna help because most people the way they learn is they have a problem.

621
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:22,678
Speaker 1: For example, their problem might be They don't know how to use Google.

622
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:23,702
Speaker 0: No, dude.

623
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:24,827
Speaker 1: Let me google that for you.

624
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:36,058
Speaker 0: LMG E-T-F-Y Googling that if I'm an idiot, I'm gonna Google for like start program log out program keeps running Mm-hmm and see what happens.

625
00:36:36,078 --> 00:36:37,424
Speaker 1: You're really bad at googling.

626
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:38,570
Speaker 1: We already know this Scott.

627
00:36:38,691 --> 00:36:40,630
Speaker 0: The people who are good at Google don't have these problems.

628
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,834
Speaker 1: That's what I'm telling you.

629
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:47,090
Speaker 1: and even then if you don't know any way your show ideas dumb show.

630
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:48,377
Speaker 0: I think it was alright Scott.

631
00:36:48,397 --> 00:36:49,624
Speaker 0: So what was your show idea?

632
00:36:49,644 --> 00:37:00,915
Speaker 1: I didn't have a show idea because Most of the ideas you came up with were a dumb or B not technology and this is a rant I had I think before on the show.

633
00:37:01,015 --> 00:37:06,792
Speaker 1: is that so much stuff on the internet that is on technology sites is not actually So?

634
00:37:07,113 --> 00:37:11,210
Speaker 0: the news about the LHC or the stuff about fracking in no way involves technology.

635
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:15,330
Speaker 1: It does involve technology, but per the definition of technology.

636
00:37:15,451 --> 00:37:19,030
Speaker 1: But a we are not deeply knowledgeable in those areas.

637
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:23,064
Speaker 0: I've learned a lot about both of those by reading articles.

638
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:24,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not deeply knowledgeable.

639
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:25,396
Speaker 1: Do a show?

640
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:30,443
Speaker 1: No show where someone's gonna come and tell us how wrong we are.

641
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:36,725
Speaker 1: Uh, maybe you Underestimate your ability to bullshit and pretend you know something when you don't.

642
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:38,030
Speaker 0: it's not that hard to learn.

643
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,790
Speaker 0: Do you realize Scott take any realm of knowledge in the world?

644
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:46,090
Speaker 0: All you have to do is just barely scratch the surface just touch it a little bit.

645
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:50,690
Speaker 0: You know more than the majority of people on that subject and are now effectively an expert as far as they're concerned.

646
00:37:50,710 --> 00:38:00,090
Speaker 1: That's true, but they could just read Wikipedia and as They wouldn't need you But they wouldn't need a podcast where we read a Wikipedia page.

647
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,863
Speaker 0: Apparently they need that apparently because that's what they always ask for.

648
00:38:04,023 --> 00:38:06,050
Speaker 1: so rims doing a great job of insulting on listeners.

649
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:10,823
Speaker 0: I hate show dude, you guys seriously the majority of shows you suggest are basically.

650
00:38:11,284 --> 00:38:15,582
Speaker 0: you've emailed us and said hey Would you read this Wikipedia article and summarize it for me?

651
00:38:15,863 --> 00:38:17,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, read it yourself.

652
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:18,495
Speaker 0: Learn to read.

653
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:20,000
Speaker 0: anyway, it's fundamental.

654
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,529
Speaker 1: I guess if you're illiterate a podcast would really fucking help you.

655
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:26,093
Speaker 1: No, I'm insulting listeners But anyway, I would go.

656
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:31,330
Speaker 1: so I complained, you know as the usual complaint that so much tech news is not actually tech news.

657
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,402
Speaker 1: It is business news or you know science news.

658
00:38:35,422 --> 00:38:38,070
Speaker 0: No, I agree with you on that front, but it won.

659
00:38:38,873 --> 00:38:42,127
Speaker 0: You know, it's Mondays is very specifically science.

660
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:44,052
Speaker 0: Yes Technology.

661
00:38:44,112 --> 00:38:45,677
Speaker 0: Yes and neck beards.

662
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:46,239
Speaker 1: That's right.

663
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:49,490
Speaker 1: We don't we don't know much about the science or the neck.

664
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:50,454
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

665
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:53,426
Speaker 0: you weren't arguing last night that oh, we shouldn't do these topics.

666
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:56,756
Speaker 0: We don't know a lot about him But you said that was one of my argument.

667
00:38:56,836 --> 00:39:06,486
Speaker 0: or you say that technology in this implied arbitrary concept struck means only Linux related neckbeard computer technology bullshit.

668
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:07,250
Speaker 1: That is the second.

669
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,435
Speaker 0: Are you mean other technology?

670
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:09,861
Speaker 1: there were two arguments that I had.

671
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:16,570
Speaker 1: one was that we don't know about it and two That when people talk if you go to a tech news site, right that says it's tech news.

672
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:30,594
Speaker 1: They might have bullshit business news about technology businesses, but it pretty much focuses on You know the consumer electronics and enterprise computing Industries primarily.

673
00:39:30,654 --> 00:39:35,930
Speaker 1: it does not ever focus, you know, cuz on any of the other things that are also technology.

674
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:47,498
Speaker 1: right, you can't go to say slash dot and get a story about advances in some kind of new Technology.

675
00:39:47,578 --> 00:39:50,590
Speaker 0: a lot of the news on slash dot is non computer tech news.

676
00:39:51,674 --> 00:39:52,543
Speaker 1: Not very much.

677
00:39:52,644 --> 00:39:53,190
Speaker 0: What do you know?

678
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:55,468
Speaker 0: You don't even know.

679
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:58,630
Speaker 1: Anyway, I just picked a tech news site at random.

680
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,119
Speaker 0: I know the point is last.

681
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:01,990
Speaker 0: I was you should have picked dig then you would have been fine.

682
00:40:02,772 --> 00:40:04,036
Speaker 1: Dig isn't just tech news though.

683
00:40:04,077 --> 00:40:07,427
Speaker 1: It was right, but you're not gonna go to engadget and see something about.

684
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:19,002
Speaker 0: you know medical news of medical technology Construction technology pages right now Using cloud computing and Watson stuff to treat cancer.

685
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:22,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's computing is What.

686
00:40:22,552 --> 00:40:23,635
Speaker 0: it's also biology.

687
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:28,508
Speaker 0: it's yeah, it's but it's not about the battery storage with seaweed.

688
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:34,710
Speaker 1: that's also Consumer electronics related because batteries have a very large bearing on consumer electronics.

689
00:40:35,151 --> 00:40:38,601
Speaker 0: Okay, 50 new exoplanets found billions more away.

690
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:40,546
Speaker 1: That's just straight-up science, which is fine.

691
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:41,970
Speaker 1: It's not even technology at all.

692
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:43,496
Speaker 1: It's like we were.

693
00:40:43,517 --> 00:40:50,847
Speaker 1: you know, we were discussing just before things that are technology Per the definition of the word technology, but aren't technology as he.

694
00:40:50,887 --> 00:40:51,470
Speaker 0: but it depends.

695
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:57,124
Speaker 0: What if that article is talking about the technology used to make the scientific discovery?

696
00:40:57,946 --> 00:40:58,146
Speaker 1: Is it?

697
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:58,968
Speaker 0: I don't know.

698
00:40:58,988 --> 00:40:59,369
Speaker 0: I didn't read it.

699
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:03,919
Speaker 0: Appropriations bill threatens future space science missions.

700
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:06,107
Speaker 0: That is the effects of politics and technology.

701
00:41:06,127 --> 00:41:13,560
Speaker 0: political news But it's also technology news because if the government for example outlawed all technology Then that would.

702
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:15,209
Speaker 0: I would argue that's technology news.

703
00:41:16,831 --> 00:41:17,874
Speaker 1: It is news related.

704
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:23,530
Speaker 1: In fact, it might be the last technology news, but it is not raw it is not pure boring technology.

705
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,861
Speaker 0: Glowing cats real take out making glowing cats.

706
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:27,844
Speaker 0: That is technology.

707
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:29,810
Speaker 1: biology and science is nothing technological about.

708
00:41:30,003 --> 00:41:37,266
Speaker 0: Yeah There is because the biology is understanding it the science is researching the technology is fucking doing it in a practical way And I have a glowing cat.

709
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:42,170
Speaker 1: The point is you get you can any I could see by those kind of arguments.

710
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,636
Speaker 1: You could say that anything is tech news.

711
00:41:43,816 --> 00:41:46,627
Speaker 1: I could be like hey, here's the scores the latest football game.

712
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:47,330
Speaker 1: That's tech news.

713
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:47,875
Speaker 1: Why?

714
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:49,250
Speaker 1: because they use technology?

715
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:54,002
Speaker 0: It's not because the article is about the technology and to keep time.

716
00:41:54,283 --> 00:42:01,885
Speaker 0: and now if the article were about the technology like say It talked about you know a time like a new way to score fencing with different technology.

717
00:42:01,905 --> 00:42:02,688
Speaker 0: That's more accurate.

718
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:03,330
Speaker 0: That's tech news.

719
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:04,795
Speaker 1: That would be.

720
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:14,230
Speaker 0: or if it described how existing technology works That's tech commentary, but if it was just the scores of fencing with no discussion of the technology, that's not tech news.

721
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:16,557
Speaker 1: But what if they're in the?

722
00:42:16,677 --> 00:42:17,441
Speaker 1: in these it was.

723
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:19,490
Speaker 1: it was primarily fencing scores.

724
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:28,429
Speaker 1: but at one point in the article they talked about how there was a dispute over a point and there was a. There was a technological difference.

725
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:31,121
Speaker 0: That is a seed for technology discussion.

726
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:38,553
Speaker 0: because you take the article and say look at this issue Look at this technological problem, which caused these Ramifications outside of the realm of tech.

727
00:42:39,154 --> 00:42:40,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you go after ethics classes.

728
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:44,072
Speaker 0: I took at RIT basically boiled down to Technology.

729
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:45,981
Speaker 0: bad if used badly.

730
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:47,850
Speaker 0: look at what happened to society.

731
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:52,088
Speaker 1: I took like five me and play took five of those classes at least me and play.

732
00:42:52,108 --> 00:42:54,219
Speaker 1: god I think I could have like minored in that.

733
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:54,843
Speaker 0: Yep.

734
00:42:55,486 --> 00:42:56,190
Speaker 0: We always talked about.

735
00:42:58,273 --> 00:43:09,348
Speaker 0: In fact, I would say that the majority of the examples in those classes involve the Laplanders and snowmobiles a Anyway anyway Clever bot and the Turing test.

736
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:11,695
Speaker 1: That is a technology news.

737
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:17,334
Speaker 1: Okay, but the point is a lot of the technology news is that are actually pure Technology news.

738
00:43:17,454 --> 00:43:23,170
Speaker 1: right in the narrow area of the consumer right are wicked boring with nothing to discuss.

739
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:30,174
Speaker 0: So why do we even have technology as a show topic if all we're gonna talk about is the fact that because 9.1 Was just released bitches.

740
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:34,850
Speaker 0: It has serializable snapshot isolation and I'll bet none of you know what that means.

741
00:43:34,931 --> 00:43:37,065
Speaker 1: I don't even know what that means and I sure I probably should.

742
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:37,830
Speaker 0: I use Postgres.

743
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:42,041
Speaker 0: I actually used Postgres a lot the serializable snapshot isolation.

744
00:43:42,101 --> 00:43:45,630
Speaker 1: so I can understand what snapshot isolation is with serializable.

745
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:52,373
Speaker 1: I guess the snapshots are in order, you know what order they're in The cereal.

746
00:43:52,393 --> 00:43:52,954
Speaker 0: here's the article.

747
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:56,765
Speaker 0: the serializable isolation level provides the strictest transaction isolation.

748
00:43:57,026 --> 00:44:02,282
Speaker 0: this level emulates serial transaction Execution as if transactions had been executed one after another.

749
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:04,950
Speaker 0: that is serially rather than concurrently.

750
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:12,110
Speaker 0: However, like the repeatable read level applications using this level must be prepared to recharge transactions due to serialization failures.

751
00:44:12,551 --> 00:44:19,270
Speaker 0: In fact, this isolation level works exactly at the same as the repeatable read except that monitors for conditions where okay.

752
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:20,778
Speaker 0: I don't think any of you care.

753
00:44:20,798 --> 00:44:21,984
Speaker 1: I understood it though now.

754
00:44:22,024 --> 00:44:25,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no one cares I'm talking about real technology.

755
00:44:25,786 --> 00:44:28,140
Speaker 0: news is undermine your argument.

756
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,430
Speaker 0: if that is mostly.

757
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:39,410
Speaker 0: If your argument is that that is what tech news is mostly and we are a tech news show by your definition Why the fuck are we doing this boring ass podcast?

758
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,650
Speaker 1: Well, because we do the same thing that I complain about all the tech news sites doing which is we often take business news.

759
00:44:44,772 --> 00:44:45,707
Speaker 0: So shouldn't we do that?

760
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,459
Speaker 0: What's the other option talk about?

761
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,383
Speaker 0: I can go on.

762
00:44:49,403 --> 00:44:50,830
Speaker 0: let me go back into that Postgres article.

763
00:44:51,572 --> 00:44:57,210
Speaker 1: No, but if you go to a site like for onyx, oh shit Scott, it supports se Linux, that's good.

764
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:59,149
Speaker 0: I've never seen anyone use se Linux.

765
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:01,923
Speaker 1: It's on by default in some.

766
00:45:02,104 --> 00:45:02,809
Speaker 0: yes, and you know what?

767
00:45:04,191 --> 00:45:07,616
Speaker 0: Google for any problem and Se Linux?

768
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:09,590
Speaker 1: and the answer is turn se Linux?

769
00:45:09,715 --> 00:45:16,335
Speaker 0: Oh, yes The first thing you will find is a tutorial on how to turn se Linux off and never turn it back or at least every single Thing it complains about.

770
00:45:16,355 --> 00:45:19,830
Speaker 1: you make an exception for that thing to turn off all those features that are in your way.

771
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,219
Speaker 0: I've never seen someone use se Linux in production.

772
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,210
Speaker 1: But anyway, I think the NSA does and people like that.

773
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I haven't seen.

774
00:45:26,053 --> 00:45:31,770
Speaker 0: I mean, but think I worked on Wall Street and turning se Linux off was standard operating procedure.

775
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:34,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much security.

776
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:41,146
Speaker 0: Once where someone turned it on whoa, that's fuck that fuck some privacy.

777
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:42,470
Speaker 1: This is this is real tech news.

778
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:43,494
Speaker 0: That's not tech news.

779
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:45,884
Speaker 0: That's guys got that's meta tech discussion.

780
00:45:45,904 --> 00:45:47,250
Speaker 0: cuz you said - it's not news.

781
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:48,497
Speaker 0: We can't talk about what we do.

782
00:45:48,718 --> 00:45:50,146
Speaker 0: who says we're a news show?

783
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:50,770
Speaker 0: we're not.

784
00:45:51,011 --> 00:45:52,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just have news bits at the front.

785
00:45:52,457 --> 00:45:54,286
Speaker 0: We could have tech commentary we can.

786
00:45:54,306 --> 00:45:55,270
Speaker 0: cuz that was my other idea.

787
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,521
Speaker 1: Maybe I do show by se Linux.

788
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,045
Speaker 1: We just did it.

789
00:45:57,106 --> 00:45:57,449
Speaker 1: It's over.

790
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, anything else to say about exactly?

791
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:01,947
Speaker 1: there's so many shows where there's a topic and we.

792
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:04,020
Speaker 1: it's a good topic But there's just not enough to know.

793
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:13,021
Speaker 0: we could talk about for example The kinds of problems I've faced in technology in the last like two years I think are really interesting examples of what high-level IT is.

794
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:15,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think that I don't want to do meta shows.

795
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:19,060
Speaker 0: I just you draw from experience like MC front lines.

796
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,732
Speaker 1: latest album is almost 90% of it is about MC front Like.

797
00:46:22,773 --> 00:46:23,356
Speaker 0: here's a problem.

798
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:24,181
Speaker 1: It's great music.

799
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:25,730
Speaker 1: It's sort of like a problem.

800
00:46:26,073 --> 00:46:27,630
Speaker 1: I know who you are get this album.

801
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,429
Speaker 0: I have a big thing that does some map reduce shenanigans and solar and all.

802
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:32,836
Speaker 1: yesterday You know my produce was.

803
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,223
Speaker 1: did you read the Wikipedia on it today?

804
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:35,067
Speaker 1: So you can tell me.

805
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:36,889
Speaker 0: put it this way I knew what it was.

806
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:43,846
Speaker 0: What I couldn't do is go into much depth on it because I don't really know a lot about data structures or anything because I'm not a coder.

807
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:49,930
Speaker 0: but Basically the problem I actually had was that the Hadoop file system done got corrupted.

808
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:54,709
Speaker 0: Oh shit, so and I had to uncorrupt it, you know how I did that the command that uncorrupts it.

809
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:55,913
Speaker 0: now There isn't such a thing.

810
00:46:56,194 --> 00:46:56,434
Speaker 0: Okay.

811
00:46:56,555 --> 00:47:01,430
Speaker 0: So luckily you don't put anything that matters in that sort of file system persistently.

812
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:06,840
Speaker 0: That's where you put the data while you're processing and then you put it somewhere else so To bring it back.

813
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:11,150
Speaker 0: There's an edits file We and there's an edits dot new file and there's an image file.

814
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:15,529
Speaker 0: The image is kind of like a base image of the virtualized distributed disk.

815
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:19,165
Speaker 0: And then the edits files are the kind of like a transaction log.

816
00:47:19,185 --> 00:47:20,250
Speaker 0: It's like a meta file system.

817
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:33,490
Speaker 0: So I replaced the edits log with a binary file with one blank line and just lost those edits Thus allowing the file system to pick up where it had left off before the transaction log got corrupt and I lost some data.

818
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,378
Speaker 0: But I didn't need that data.

819
00:47:34,802 --> 00:47:37,087
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm BAM Uh-huh.

820
00:47:38,014 --> 00:47:39,229
Speaker 1: So yeah, actually, you know what?

821
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,515
Speaker 1: I'm actually came up with a great show idea.

822
00:47:41,635 --> 00:47:41,976
Speaker 1: really.

823
00:47:41,996 --> 00:47:43,300
Speaker 1: this shows sort of turning into.

824
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:47,413
Speaker 1: we collect a whole bunch of those tech topics Like that.

825
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:49,721
Speaker 1: we only have five like a minute to discuss.

826
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,150
Speaker 1: do them all and we combine them into one mega show.

827
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:53,998
Speaker 0: We almost really cute like rim and Scott.

828
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:56,350
Speaker 0: when do you use no SQL dear listener?

829
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:59,059
Speaker 1: Never because you know this good time season.

830
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,244
Speaker 0: there are but mode.

831
00:48:00,465 --> 00:48:01,770
Speaker 0: the majority of people I've ever met.

832
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:03,179
Speaker 1: They're using it because the buzzword.

833
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:04,367
Speaker 0: Yes who want to use it.

834
00:48:04,387 --> 00:48:06,750
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah I got like a hundred megabytes of data.

835
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,124
Speaker 0: So I put it in a do to map.

836
00:48:09,204 --> 00:48:10,893
Speaker 1: reduce it right here You want to.

837
00:48:11,074 --> 00:48:11,617
Speaker 1: you want me to explain.

838
00:48:11,637 --> 00:48:12,360
Speaker 1: map reduce to you?

839
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:13,245
Speaker 1: It's real simple.

840
00:48:13,466 --> 00:48:15,195
Speaker 1: So here's how it works Don't you just bizarre?

841
00:48:15,235 --> 00:48:15,557
Speaker 0: Let's see if.

842
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:18,030
Speaker 0: let's see if my high IT explanation makes sense.

843
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:20,662
Speaker 1: Okay, so I got a really great way of explaining it.

844
00:48:20,722 --> 00:48:23,252
Speaker 0: so I get big data set and I have some calculations I want to do on it.

845
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:23,554
Speaker 0: Yep.

846
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:27,990
Speaker 0: So hopefully not all those calculations depend on other cut.

847
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,805
Speaker 0: It's not like one serial chain of calculation.

848
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:30,330
Speaker 1: That's right.

849
00:48:30,692 --> 00:48:36,889
Speaker 0: So I break it up into as many chunks as I can and distribute the processing of those chunks Yep, and then I put the fucker back together, right?

850
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:37,956
Speaker 0: But that's what I know.

851
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:39,810
Speaker 1: which part is the map in which parts the reduce?

852
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:48,449
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say that map is Figuring out the problem space breaking it up and reduce is reducing all the solution out of the condensate sort.

853
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:51,177
Speaker 1: of right It's pretty that's pretty much all 90% right?

854
00:48:51,238 --> 00:48:51,960
Speaker 0: you realize that?

855
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:56,454
Speaker 0: I answered that almost entirely based on guessing words Yeah and language.

856
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:59,684
Speaker 1: So let's say you want to add 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6, right?

857
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:06,150
Speaker 1: Well Adding you don't need to add the 1 and the 2 before you can add the 3 to it, right?

858
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,495
Speaker 1: You can add them up all separately.

859
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:11,630
Speaker 1: So what you do is first you map and what the map does is it'll break it up.

860
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,372
Speaker 1: So it'll say hey you over there computer number 1 you do 1 plus 2.

861
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:19,031
Speaker 1: Computer number 2 do 3 plus 4. computer number 3 do 5 plus 6.

862
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:28,750
Speaker 1: So each of these three computers does its separate piece of work and then computer the original Computer that did that mapping and mapped the problem to all those separate computers gets back all the answers.

863
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:36,671
Speaker 1: So the first computer says hey 3 the second computer says hey 7, you know, and the third computer says hey 11.

864
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:38,157
Speaker 0: It was just right.

865
00:49:38,177 --> 00:49:38,438
Speaker 1: Yep.

866
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:47,561
Speaker 1: So then the starting computer says aha 3 7 11 that is 21. and that combining of the answers is the reduce.

867
00:49:47,962 --> 00:49:48,644
Speaker 0: All right.

868
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:49,426
Speaker 0: I was correct.

869
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:50,549
Speaker 1: That's pretty much how it works.

870
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:54,280
Speaker 1: So Google invented this in 2004. ish, right?

871
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,429
Speaker 1: So you think well, you know, how great is that?

872
00:49:57,509 --> 00:49:57,770
Speaker 1: Really?

873
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,385
Speaker 1: Well, it's pretty great because you can use that for almost anything.

874
00:50:01,425 --> 00:50:05,429
Speaker 1: if you can find a way to redefine Your problem, right?

875
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:11,650
Speaker 1: You can get that problem to be completed a lot faster by getting a whole bunch of computers to work together on it.

876
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:14,090
Speaker 1: For example, you want to encode a video?

877
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:31,650
Speaker 1: Well, you can just break up all the frames say computer number 1 render frame 1 computer number 2 render frame 2 computer number 3 render frame 3 and they all send the rendered frames back to the first computer and It's sort of like bit torrenting at your work, you know, it's like hey everyone out there do a little bit of work.

878
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,943
Speaker 1: I broke up my homework into you know, one problem each for all of you.

879
00:50:34,963 --> 00:50:38,119
Speaker 1: everyone do one homework problem And then it'll be.

880
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:39,950
Speaker 1: you know, let's say you had a thousand homework problems.

881
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:42,610
Speaker 1: If you did them all in order, it would take a thousand times long.

882
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:48,649
Speaker 1: But if everyone does one it'll take one long because everyone does the problem at the same time.

883
00:50:49,492 --> 00:50:54,610
Speaker 0: Now, of course once again the majority of people out there, especially if you're listening to geek nights probably don't need that for anything.

884
00:50:55,491 --> 00:51:01,030
Speaker 1: No, but be aware that when you you know use computers that are big they're pretty much all doing that all the time.

885
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:08,450
Speaker 0: But the real answer there is if you run into if you have problems with data like that You just have to google all the frameworks and figure out which one works best.

886
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:08,793
Speaker 0: You know what?

887
00:51:08,813 --> 00:51:11,069
Speaker 0: There's tutorials and you'll have it running pretty quick.

888
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:14,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, but let's say you're using something like couch TV and you want to.

889
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:15,835
Speaker 1: you know Do some work on your couch DB.

890
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:16,417
Speaker 1: write a view.

891
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:26,444
Speaker 1: they actually make you write a map function and a reduce function Like it actually says right in the user interface like map Reduce and you write two functions and that's how you get stuff out of couch TV.

892
00:51:26,725 --> 00:51:27,067
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

893
00:51:27,288 --> 00:51:27,870
Speaker 1: It's pretty crazy.

894
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:29,524
Speaker 0: I actually like couch DB.

895
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:30,129
Speaker 1: That's all right.

896
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,963
Speaker 1: They're adding they're gonna add this couch query language to it.

897
00:51:33,546 --> 00:51:42,790
Speaker 1: once that's in there It's gonna be hot because then you'll be able to do normal kind of queries Like give me all the documents that have a tag of this and order them by this.

898
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:49,349
Speaker 0: It's so great for like rapid prototyping like you're writing like you're writing a quick proof of concept You don't have to worry about database schema.

899
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:55,180
Speaker 0: You just get to what you're trying to do with the data and then when you're done with the prototype Well, now, you know what your schema are.

900
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,869
Speaker 0: because look what your couch DB's got in it.

901
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:01,167
Speaker 1: Yeah, once they add that couch query language, I might bust out with some stuff.

902
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:02,275
Speaker 1: All right All right.

903
00:52:02,316 --> 00:52:03,369
Speaker 0: So what should we do the show on?

904
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:07,485
Speaker 1: Well, I came up with that idea, but I think I haven't actually came with another show.

905
00:52:07,706 --> 00:52:08,550
Speaker 0: I'm game.

906
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:11,720
Speaker 1: What if we did a show about benchmarking in general?

907
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:12,764
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't think.

908
00:52:12,784 --> 00:52:13,628
Speaker 0: have we done a show on?

909
00:52:13,648 --> 00:52:14,230
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

910
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,903
Speaker 1: We did show on overclocking but not benchmark.

911
00:52:16,944 --> 00:52:18,190
Speaker 0: All right, that's the next Monday show.

912
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:22,073
Speaker 1: Discuss benchmarking in a sort of you know Conceptual way.

913
00:52:22,193 --> 00:52:28,854
Speaker 0: talk a little bit about this for any specific benchmark different algorithms because I'm happy that you know windows includes benchmarking now Though people don't often notice.

914
00:52:28,954 --> 00:52:31,082
Speaker 1: Well, it's not really sorta.

915
00:52:31,223 --> 00:52:36,204
Speaker 1: it is to a degree kinda Yeah, but let's not just let's not blow our load on it.
