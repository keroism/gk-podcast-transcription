1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,648
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, May 27th.

2
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:10,970
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:12,925
Speaker 1: I'm Dr.

4
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:13,169
Speaker 1: Mario.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,188
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:16,680
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about Scott.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,907
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, considering the bank holiday yesterday, we decided not to do a show.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably because it was late at night, walking back from getting ice cream.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,344
Speaker 0: Oh, that was the worst thing.

11
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:44,160
Speaker 0: We had the Visigoths over, which they were surprisingly non-Visigothic.

12
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:45,879
Speaker 1: We still have a big mess to clean up.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not nearly as bad as past, and pretty much everyone pulled their part.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,080
Speaker 0: But we were walking back from getting ice cream after getting dinner yesterday.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,614
Speaker 1: And Rem is like, "Hey, Scott, what are we going to do the show on

16
00:00:57,956 --> 00:00:58,358
Speaker 1: tonight?".

17
00:00:58,781 --> 00:00:59,307
Speaker 1: And I'm like,

18
00:00:59,327 --> 00:00:59,751
Speaker 1: "Ugh!".

19
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:05,296
Speaker 0: And then I think the conversation went something along the lines of, "Bail,

20
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:05,899
Speaker 0: bail.".

21
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, that wasn't going to happen.

22
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:09,860
Speaker 1: It was too late, and there were people there, and yeah.

23
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:11,240
Speaker 1: There was nothing to talk about either.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:11,921
Speaker 0: Yep.

25
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:13,129
Speaker 0: It was a good weekend, though.

26
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:14,779
Speaker 0: We played a lot of vidya games.

27
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:16,830
Speaker 1: A lot of vidya game playing going on.

28
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:23,220
Speaker 1: I'm trying to clear out the vidya game queue, because once I clear it out, it's like free-sailing on all this other stuff.

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,784
Speaker 1: But yeah, I don't know.

30
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:27,640
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was warm today.

31
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,160
Speaker 0: Warm today.

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, not as warm yesterday.

33
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,400
Speaker 1: Quite warmer today.

34
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:36,447
Speaker 0: I was actually surprised.

35
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:41,720
Speaker 0: I get up, and I'm tired, and I go to work, and I get off the train, and it's like 100 degrees under Grand Central.

36
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:45,900
Speaker 1: It's really hot, because there's all the train engines under there, and yeah.

37
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got to be like all those MTA employees.

38
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,380
Speaker 0: They always get on the train and beacon in their pajamas.

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,401
Speaker 1: Yep.

40
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,534
Speaker 1: Then they change at work in the locker room.

41
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,880
Speaker 1: I wish my work had a locker room.

42
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:03,580
Speaker 0: All right, so let's get right into this, because since Scott gets home late lately, he gets home a couple hours later than usual.

43
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,160
Speaker 1: Pretty much exactly one hour later.

44
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then we don't do the show right away, and one thing leads to another, and now it's late.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, what do you want?

46
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:11,560
Speaker 0: Come home earlier?

47
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:12,759
Speaker 1: I can't do anything about that.

48
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,502
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could.

49
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:17,579
Speaker 0: What happened to, "If my job ever asked me to do blah, I'd give them what for"?

50
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:18,819
Speaker 1: I did give them what for.

51
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:20,360
Speaker 0: And you're still staying late.

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:20,919
Speaker 1: It didn't work.

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,583
Speaker 0: But it didn't work.

54
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:24,509
Speaker 0: What for did you give?

55
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,700
Speaker 0: What for is when you give what for?

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,460
Speaker 1: See, the problem I have here, right, is I could just quit, which I would do, but it's like, I kind of like the people at work.

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,368
Speaker 1: Then don't quit.

58
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:38,178
Speaker 1: Make demands.

59
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,340
Speaker 1: I did, but that demand will not be met.

60
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,301
Speaker 0: Really?

61
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:46,177
Speaker 0: Did they say, "Well, we're not going to, and if you press forward, we'll fire you"?

62
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:49,436
Speaker 1: No, they're pretty much like, "That's how it's going to

63
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:49,617
Speaker 1: be.".

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,620
Speaker 1: And it's pretty much my options are quit or stay an hour later.

65
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,000
Speaker 0: If I were you, I would pretty much be already looking for a new job.

66
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,807
Speaker 1: I'm looking around a little bit.

67
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:07,840
Speaker 0: I'm feeling the waters, but the problem is- No, the hospital, pretty much the day the hospital went to, "Yes, stay late for all this BS,".

68
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:14,940
Speaker 0: the next day I spent the first hour of my work looking for a new job.

69
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:16,168
Speaker 1: I looked around.

70
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:17,560
Speaker 1: I could find a new job pretty easily.

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:28,380
Speaker 1: The problem is, unlike the hospital where you hated everyone, the people at my work, it's like I'm needed quite a bit right now, and I don't want to screw them over because I like them.

72
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,800
Speaker 0: If you're needed, then you can make some sort of demands, either more vacation time or more money or something.

73
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,162
Speaker 1: I did.

74
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:36,216
Speaker 1: I went in with my vacation today, and I think I'm going to get all the days.

75
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:39,680
Speaker 1: I'm basically not going to work much in August at all.

76
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,460
Speaker 1: I'm going to get the whole week after Otacon and Otacon and PAX and the Kineticon day.

77
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:47,680
Speaker 1: I'm going to get all them days and Monday.

78
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:49,894
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

79
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:50,280
Speaker 1: Anyway.

80
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,500
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I'd like to point this out.

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,160
Speaker 0: Xbox Live Arcade is pretty much unmitigated awesome.

82
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:06,156
Speaker 1: Well, for me, it would be like the only reason to get an Xbox is to play all those games they got in there, like the Carcassonne and the Pac-Man and the Settlers.

83
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,020
Speaker 0: A very important game is now out on Xbox Live Arcade.

84
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,700
Speaker 1: Body Commando Rearmed, right?

85
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,944
Speaker 0: Not even talking about that.

86
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:18,760
Speaker 0: This is a four-way versus game that you all must, must play.

87
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,260
Speaker 1: Four-way versus, huh?

88
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,565
Speaker 0: It is an ancient game.

89
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:25,280
Speaker 0: It is one of the most popular games in the history of the Atari.

90
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,372
Speaker 0: No, four-way.

91
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:28,040
Speaker 0: Combat is two-way.

92
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:29,540
Speaker 1: Kong Pro-Ab, which is four-player?

93
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:30,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

94
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:31,800
Speaker 0: So does that Olympic game.

95
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:32,779
Speaker 1: That's a bad game.

96
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:33,879
Speaker 0: I like that game.

97
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,900
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean the Olympic Pong, right?

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,880
Speaker 0: The one that's just like every kind of Pong the human race could conceive.

99
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,020
Speaker 0: No, this is a game where there are four corners and four people.

100
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,685
Speaker 1: Warlords.

101
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:45,720
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,540
Speaker 0: And each person has a little wall to protect and inside of that wall is their penis.

103
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:53,579
Speaker 1: It's a castle with a guy in it.

104
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:54,845
Speaker 0: No, no.

105
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:58,560
Speaker 0: It's a castle with a video frame in Xbox Live.

106
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:00,719
Speaker 0: Video of your penis.

107
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:04,840
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a good call.

108
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:05,960
Speaker 0: I imagine.

109
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:07,440
Speaker 1: Very excellent design decision.

110
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,299
Speaker 0: If someone were, I don't know, crazy, they might put something in that video other than their penis.

111
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:14,639
Speaker 0: Maybe if they're a girl.

112
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,438
Speaker 0: But then you've got to have a sham penis ready to go.

113
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,555
Speaker 1: Sham-bun.

114
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:20,479
Speaker 0: What comes out of a sham-bun?

115
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:20,917
Speaker 0: Shampoo.

116
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:28,380
Speaker 1: That's a good call because the basic idea of Warlords is that you're playing this sort of four-way Pong.

117
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:33,160
Speaker 1: And everyone has this sort of corner of the board to protect and they have a castle wall.

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,440
Speaker 1: And they themselves are inside the castle wall.

119
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:44,680
Speaker 1: So what better, instead of having some digital avatar representing the person inside the castle wall, have a video of them inside the castle wall.

120
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,400
Speaker 1: It's a great idea.

121
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:46,279
Speaker 0: Of their penis.

122
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,312
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it's a good idea.

123
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:49,058
Speaker 1: I like it.

124
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,320
Speaker 0: But Warlords.

125
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,640
Speaker 1: And Warlords is a great game.

126
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:52,503
Speaker 0: It's what I guess.

127
00:05:52,704 --> 00:06:03,300
Speaker 0: I really, I think that the best kinds of games to play with a whole bunch of people, especially like casual gaming, are the very abstract, very directly competitive games.

128
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,919
Speaker 0: Games like my dot's going to push your dot off the board.

129
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,015
Speaker 1: Well, that's why I think the boom blocks is fun.

130
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,620
Speaker 1: for that reason.

131
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've got to play that boom blocks.

132
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,260
Speaker 0: It's not worth $50.

133
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,684
Speaker 1: No, that's the thing.

134
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,600
Speaker 1: is the boom box looks really fun.

135
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:19,800
Speaker 1: And I'm sure it's really fun and I can sort of tell that it's going to be good if I play it.

136
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,280
Speaker 1: But seriously.

137
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,040
Speaker 1: But it's not worth $50.

138
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,229
Speaker 1: Warlords.

139
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,473
Speaker 1: Bring that shit down to 30, yo.

140
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,100
Speaker 0: One, you can get, if you have an Atari, you can get Warlords for like a dime.

141
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,180
Speaker 1: You can get Warlords for pretty much almost any system.

142
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,477
Speaker 1: I have Warlords on my DS.

143
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,260
Speaker 0: And in fact, Warlords on Xbox Live is only 400 Microsoft points, which is like 800 space dollars.

144
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,579
Speaker 1: How many, how many is it?

145
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,260
Speaker 1: It's another we, a one point is like one penny.

146
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,779
Speaker 1: So what is it on the Microsoft?

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,807
Speaker 0: One Microsoft point is 8.94 pence times a Euro.

148
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,037
Speaker 0: I don't, I don't know.

149
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:52,797
Speaker 1: Times a Euro.

150
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,438
Speaker 1: That's a lot.

151
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:59,022
Speaker 1: That's like $10.

152
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:00,060
Speaker 1: Is that how you got there?

153
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:01,020
Speaker 0: What else am I going to say?

154
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,540
Speaker 0: It's Warlords.

155
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,760
Speaker 0: I'm going to review Warlords.

156
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,239
Speaker 0: You know what?

157
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,780
Speaker 1: Warlords is fucking awesome play.

158
00:07:05,022 --> 00:07:05,758
Speaker 0: It's really fun.

159
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,160
Speaker 1: As long as you play the multiplayer.

160
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,360
Speaker 1: Single player is lame.

161
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,537
Speaker 0: Terribly deep.

162
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:11,820
Speaker 1: Well, there's the catching mechanism.

163
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,780
Speaker 0: Well, not only if you turn that on.

164
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,220
Speaker 0: I don't know how the Xbox one goes.

165
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,200
Speaker 1: There's also the speed release mechanism.

166
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,580
Speaker 0: There were a couple of modes in the Atari.

167
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,418
Speaker 0: That's true.

168
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,860
Speaker 0: Actually though, if anyone's hardcore, and I got to see if we can get one of these for Katsu-Con.

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,940
Speaker 0: I don't know if we can, but the Warlords arcade cabinet, the upper right was pretty mad.

170
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,020
Speaker 0: It was two player, whatever.

171
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:31,517
Speaker 1: Yeah.

172
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,220
Speaker 0: The cocktail version, which is one of my favorite ways to play games.

173
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:36,680
Speaker 1: That is excellent.

174
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,880
Speaker 0: I love those old cocktail cabinets.

175
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,280
Speaker 1: Like if I had like a room that needed a tiny table, I would get one of those.

176
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,760
Speaker 0: The thing is, there's something about those cocktail cabinets that it's not just like the functionality or whatever.

177
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,780
Speaker 0: That is from a different era of gaming.

178
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:58,780
Speaker 0: That is back when video gaming was not the purview of punk kids, but video gaming was something that they expected to sell to somewhat well-to-do people in bars.

179
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,753
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, there was a dentist or orthodontist.

180
00:08:02,794 --> 00:08:05,400
Speaker 1: I went to, I forget, but it was in some waiting room of some office.

181
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:12,420
Speaker 1: And whenever I went there, he had a little arcade and in his arcade, he had a Galaxian cocktail set, right?

182
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:18,739
Speaker 1: And from until I saw Galaxian upright, I thought that just, "Oh, Galaxian is like

183
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:18,939
Speaker 1: that.".

184
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:21,079
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that it was a thing.

185
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, but cocktail cabinets used to be just fixtures and bars and restaurants all over.

186
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, doesn't Bomber's Burrito Bar have a Pac-Man cocktail one?

187
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,200
Speaker 0: Yes.

188
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,616
Speaker 0: No, I don't remember if it's Pac-Man or Ms.

189
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:32,120
Speaker 0: Pac-Man.

190
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:32,919
Speaker 1: I forget.

191
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,139
Speaker 0: But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy.

192
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:38,299
Speaker 0: It required the precise... Okay.

193
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,298
Speaker 0: Man, we're just playing inside baseball all night tonight.

194
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,360
Speaker 0: But seriously, it just, it harkens to a different age and there's a certain element of class there.

195
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:49,939
Speaker 1: I had an idea just now.

196
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:54,200
Speaker 1: Why don't we make cocktail cabinets of newer games?

197
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:59,200
Speaker 1: Maybe just put a PC in there with some Mame or something or I don't know.

198
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,240
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's been done, right?

199
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,899
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, you know what?

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,060
Speaker 1: Just pop an NES and a TV in there with an LCD screen?

201
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,540
Speaker 0: We've been looking for a "use your hands" and not on a keyboard project for a long time.

202
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,935
Speaker 0: And the last one we really got into was "RibMakes a DDR Pad" and that ended in disaster.

203
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:15,820
Speaker 1: and Check this out.

204
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,157
Speaker 1: Here we go.

205
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,392
Speaker 1: Ready?

206
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,300
Speaker 1: Real simple.

207
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,100
Speaker 1: Get a normal table that two people can sit at.

208
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,660
Speaker 1: It's the right height for sitting at, right?

209
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,438
Speaker 1: Two chairs.

210
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,939
Speaker 1: Cut a hole in the table.

211
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,219
Speaker 1: Put a piece of glass in the hole in the table.

212
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,920
Speaker 1: Mount an LCD screen under the glass.

213
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:32,039
Speaker 0: Actually, you'd probably be better off with a recessed CRT.

214
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:35,120
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, mount some sort of screen under the glass.

215
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:37,194
Speaker 1: Then put some sort of Mac Mini in there.

216
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,220
Speaker 0: I can abstract your idea a little bit.

217
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,918
Speaker 0: Why don't we make a cocktail cabinet and then play games on it and have that in our lounge and be all classy?

218
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want to put a turn-based strategy game like an Advance Wars in there.

219
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:55,823
Speaker 0: I just imagined some Civ 4.

220
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:57,220
Speaker 0: The Civ 4 cocktail cabinet.

221
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,079
Speaker 1: I don't know if Civ 4 is the best choice.

222
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,220
Speaker 0: The beautiful thing about the cocktail cabinet was that usually when versus, two people would sit across from each other sharing drinks while playing a game.

223
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:14,320
Speaker 1: I mean, I've seen pictures of older Japanese arcades and when they had versus games, it would be two cabinets and they would be facing opposite each other.

224
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,700
Speaker 1: So if the cabinets weren't there, you would be looking your opponent in the eyes.

225
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,199
Speaker 0: That's because Japan is brilliant.

226
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,565
Speaker 1: But instead in the U.S.

227
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:24,220
Speaker 1: when there's a versus game, it'd be two people standing next to each other.

228
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,579
Speaker 0: That's because Americans are cheap.

229
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:26,049
Speaker 1: Yeah.

230
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:36,380
Speaker 0: But regardless, to knock it off on a tangent, if you can find a cocktail warlords cabinet, not only are they pretty big, not only are they four player and people sit at the four corners.

231
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,179
Speaker 0: Good God, are they awesome.

232
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much the best warlords experience you can get.

233
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:42,300
Speaker 1: As long as it works.

234
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,459
Speaker 1: If it's broken, it sucks.

235
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,840
Speaker 0: It's up there with Rampart.

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,557
Speaker 0: And I'll say this.

237
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:47,899
Speaker 1: It's not Rampart.

238
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,380
Speaker 0: No, the experience though of sitting around the cocktail.

239
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,640
Speaker 1: Oh man, Rampart cocktail.

240
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,051
Speaker 0: I don't think that existed.

241
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:54,640
Speaker 1: I think it would work though.

242
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:55,196
Speaker 1: I think it would.

243
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,640
Speaker 0: Really well.

244
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,680
Speaker 0: I don't think it existed.

245
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,779
Speaker 1: Because everyone had the track balls, but on their own.

246
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,463
Speaker 0: Huh.

247
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,800
Speaker 0: What if we ported German board games to a cocktail cabinet?

248
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,600
Speaker 1: It'd be okay, but you're better off just playing German board games.

249
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,020
Speaker 0: Well, maybe a Twilight struggle.

250
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:07,929
Speaker 0: Anyway.

251
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,553
Speaker 0: Anyway.

252
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,080
Speaker 1: So the Penny Arcade game, the Precipice of Darkness came out.

253
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:14,580
Speaker 1: Yes.

254
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,080
Speaker 1: And I bought it for $20.

255
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,900
Speaker 0: Well, you and everyone else, according to, I'm not going to quote anyone here, but it set some records for sales.

256
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,560
Speaker 1: What kind of sales did it make?

257
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,419
Speaker 0: The first episode of Penny Arcade Adventures was the highest grossing Xbox Live Arcade debut ever.

258
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:28,977
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

259
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,660
Speaker 1: So that was, but that was on the Xbox Live.

260
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,058
Speaker 1: There's all, I bought the PC version.

261
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:32,492
Speaker 0: Yes.

262
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:33,639
Speaker 0: I just read that paragraph.

263
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:35,520
Speaker 0: You keep talking and I'll read the sales stats.

264
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,300
Speaker 1: So if you buy the PC version, it's pretty interesting what they do.

265
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:46,140
Speaker 1: When you buy it, they give you a key and you can use that key to either play the Mac, Windows or Linux versions.

266
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:51,186
Speaker 1: And you can actually like use the key multiple times because they hate DRM as much as we do.

267
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:51,699
Speaker 1: Of course.

268
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:57,544
Speaker 1: This also means I can give the key to rim, which means we only have to pay $20 to both play the game, which,

269
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:10,180
Speaker 0: but then again, then again, there's the, uh, we didn't talk about this yesterday because bank holiday, but there's some news on that front regarding the right to first sale of software, but we'll talk about that next Monday.

270
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,488
Speaker 1: Yeah.

271
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:11,300
Speaker 1: Anyway.

272
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,220
Speaker 1: Um, so this game, uh, it's a Penny Arcade game, right?

273
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,100
Speaker 1: It's their first game.

274
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:19,480
Speaker 1: It's an episodic game.

275
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:21,940
Speaker 1: So there's going to be more episodes, right?

276
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,358
Speaker 1: I beat the whole game and this is what I have to say about it.

277
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:30,600
Speaker 1: The penny arcade ness of the game is delectable.

278
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:35,120
Speaker 1: If you like the penny arcades, this is the penny arcades full on.

279
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:41,700
Speaker 1: You got the awesomeness dialogue of the penny arcade style in the awesomeness art of the penny arcade style.

280
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,360
Speaker 1: And you got some animations, you got some nice sound effects and music.

281
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:46,440
Speaker 1: You got some environments.

282
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,380
Speaker 0: The voice acting is superb.

283
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:53,160
Speaker 1: The writing is almost none of it, but yeah, when it's there, it is superb.

284
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:02,940
Speaker 1: Pretty much everything about the game, uh, in terms of, you know, the artistic creation and the visuals and the audios and the story and everything is fantastic.

285
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:05,818
Speaker 1: The game itself is meh.

286
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:11,872
Speaker 0: If it wasn't a penny arcade game, there'll be no reason, but I thought you always argued that style and not meant nothing.

287
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,240
Speaker 0: and all that matters is gameplay.

288
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,759
Speaker 1: That's not what I say at all.

289
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,479
Speaker 1: I say that if there's, if there's no, that's not what I say.

290
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:26,519
Speaker 1: What I say is if the only thing a game has to offer is something that is not gameplay, then there's no reason to actually play it.

291
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:28,557
Speaker 1: You can always just get that.

292
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,640
Speaker 0: Does the penny arcade game offer good gameplay?

293
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:33,440
Speaker 1: Not really.

294
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,031
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

295
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,499
Speaker 1: It's only slightly better than your average, uh, it's, it's not, see the thing is it's, it's sort of fighting with itself.

296
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:51,700
Speaker 1: It's deciding whether it wants to be sort of a Japanese turn-based RPG combat kind of game, or if it wants to be sort of a like point and click adventure game.

297
00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:00,020
Speaker 1: And I really think if they just made it a full on point and click adventure game and forgot about their silly turn-based RPG combat, the game would be a hell of a lot better.

298
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:05,920
Speaker 1: But it's like, you'll go somewhere and it'd be like, oh, kill all the clowns in town.

299
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,679
Speaker 1: So you walk around the town killing all the clowns, then it's like, oh, now you got to kill all the barbershop quartets.

300
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:27,632
Speaker 1: So you go around killing all the barbershop quartets and the exact same four screens, you know, and it's sort of like, uh, and the combat itself, while better than say final fantasy where you just choose menu items and wait, you know, it's got sort of that dexterity thing that like some of the Mario RPGs have.

301
00:14:27,673 --> 00:14:32,980
Speaker 1: where it's like, you know, you got to push the button really fast and then hit it with exact timing in order to do the most damage.

302
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:33,839
Speaker 1: You know, that's, that's good.

303
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:43,900
Speaker 1: I like that kind of action, but there's not that many moves and actually doing the combat is sort of annoying because there's no like keyboard shortcuts or anything.

304
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:53,500
Speaker 1: You have to like wait for these, the attacks to ready themselves, then click on them, then click on the bad guy and the bad guys are moving, you know, sort of moving around and fighting in real time.

305
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:58,237
Speaker 1: So like if one of them is coming in to attack you, it's like, you got to sort of, ah, where did he go?

306
00:14:58,442 --> 00:14:58,978
Speaker 1: Oh, there he is.

307
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,576
Speaker 1: Click, you know, and at the same time you're waiting for these attacks to finish getting ready.

308
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:12,800
Speaker 1: You have to push the space bar with precise timing to block and that's very, very annoying, but it's also very, very easy and very quick.

309
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,399
Speaker 1: So you get it over with and sort of out of the way.

310
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:27,138
Speaker 0: I feel like the game is probably worth it just for the style and, and if you're a fan of penny arcade, it's, it's pretty much the ultimate fan experience, sort of, I guess having sex with the two of them.

311
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:37,580
Speaker 1: See, the thing is playing it though, it really feels like they should have just made a penny arcade, like flash anime, flash animation, TVs, animated penny arcade movie.

312
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,140
Speaker 0: Yeah.

313
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,660
Speaker 1: Just, you know, just, they could have made it flash just like homestar runner.

314
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:43,020
Speaker 0: They're about video games.

315
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:55,200
Speaker 0: So I feel like what they're doing is that instead of making a movie and instead of making a game, they've kind of bridged the two in a way where there's gameplay elements and what is otherwise just a movie and there's movie elements and was otherwise just a game.

316
00:15:55,781 --> 00:16:04,340
Speaker 0: And I feel like from what little I've gone through the game so far and looked at it and read it, I feel like this is a better combination of the two than many other games have done.

317
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,900
Speaker 1: That is what, there is a merger somewhat of the, the plot and the awesomeness and the gameplay.

318
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:20,927
Speaker 1: Like, you know, walking around looking at the stuff you sort of, you know, the story is sort of delivered and what you see while you're playing and you know, you talk to people in town and that gives you some of the plot

319
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:28,060
Speaker 0: is made, made by what the first like background NPC says when you first encounter him.

320
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:28,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's for sure.

321
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:30,479
Speaker 0: I don't think I should spoil it.

322
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,660
Speaker 0: Good God.

323
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:32,757
Speaker 0: Did that make the game for me?

324
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,660
Speaker 1: But, um, you know, if they didn't have that sort of stuff in there, you wouldn't have to play this game.

325
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,600
Speaker 1: You could just go on YouTube and like watch a video of all the, you know, the dialogue and all the text and then you'd be sad.

326
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:46,400
Speaker 0: Well, it depends.

327
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,840
Speaker 0: I mean, there's something to be said for experience now.

328
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,916
Speaker 0: Well, games haven't done it very well and I think there's a lot of ground to cover before games.

329
00:16:53,300 --> 00:17:07,397
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a lot more we can do in terms of gaming as a, as a medium for expression, but there's a day, like playing final fantasy form, especially final fantasy six is a good example where if it had been just a movie, it probably would have been a really damn good movie.

330
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:10,480
Speaker 0: And if it just been a, you know, TV series or whatever, I think it would have been good.

331
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:21,481
Speaker 0: But because it's a game, instead of investing one hour or if it was like a full season, 12 hours or 13 hours into it, you end up investing 40 or 50.

332
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:32,698
Speaker 0: And while that gets old, if you haven't experienced that before, I can see how that kind of, you can build more investment into the characters by causing you to have to go through all this stuff with them instead of just watching it.

333
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,159
Speaker 0: I just wish games would do it better and not just make everything a TV.

334
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,080
Speaker 1: Well, that is the one thing that the penny arcade game does, right.

335
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:42,100
Speaker 1: Is that it's very short because it's only one episode.

336
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:49,620
Speaker 1: So even though the RPG combat is sort of sort of annoying and not that great and you sort of sometimes in the game you have to do it.

337
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,220
Speaker 1: I mean, when you fought the barbershop quartets, there were like only four of them.

338
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:54,278
Speaker 1: And then that was it.

339
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:56,439
Speaker 1: So it was like, oh, I beat them all.

340
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,800
Speaker 1: OK, so none of it really takes all that long.

341
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:13,720
Speaker 1: So you won't get a chance to be really pissed off at it because when you're about to get pissed off, you sort of you beat it and you're like, oh, the only thing that I could see could be annoying is sort of trying to go around and get everything.

342
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:15,500
Speaker 1: Like I just tried to blow through the game.

343
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:17,680
Speaker 1: I didn't try to like get all the stuff.

344
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:20,579
Speaker 1: And apparently there's a lot of stuff I didn't get.

345
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,140
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I feel like a lot of that's not worth it.

346
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,878
Speaker 1: It's totally not worth it.

347
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,703
Speaker 1: So, yeah, if you like Penny Arcade, then it's probably worth your while to get the Penny Arcade game.

348
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:36,081
Speaker 1: And I'm actually I'm pretty sure that the Xbox and the PC versions are the same.

349
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:50,239
Speaker 1: So if you have an Xbox, I'm going to suggest you get that version, because even though I haven't played that version, I suspect the RPG combat will be less annoying using the gamepad as opposed to being forced to use the mouse to click on all these different things all over the place.

350
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,802
Speaker 1: Yep.

351
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:57,624
Speaker 1: And but if you do buy the PC version, you get Mac Linux Windows versions, which is way cool.

352
00:18:57,744 --> 00:18:59,794
Speaker 1: And it totally works.

353
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,000
Speaker 1: like the Linux version works.

354
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:10,020
Speaker 1: It just doesn't work on my laptop because the video card is sort of bleh, but it totally works on Windows and it works on my Linux computer at work where the video card is good.

355
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:11,719
Speaker 1: And I'm sure it'll work on a Mac.

356
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,961
Speaker 1: I haven't tried it.

357
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:23,760
Speaker 0: Ah, but anyway, things of the day, a little old here.

358
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:38,117
Speaker 0: People who are super cool have probably seen this, but I'm not a huge fan of Warhammer 40K, but I before any I mean, I'll bet you're already on your way with pitchforks, but I don't dislike Warhammer 40K.

359
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,040
Speaker 0: I love big miniature giant armies fighting game.

360
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,280
Speaker 1: Yeah.

361
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:49,299
Speaker 1: My only real problems with Warhammer 40K are the price and the amount of time it takes and the amount of space it takes.

362
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:58,204
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it's the kind of thing where if you're into it like I mean, people who play Warhammer are usually they're into it more for the modeling and the army and the style.

363
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:02,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're just doing the modeling alone and you never even play the game, that's that's perfectly cool.

364
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,259
Speaker 0: Well, even the game, too, because it's a lot like how we played Battletech, where the game itself is kind of crap.

365
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:09,720
Speaker 1: Well, it's not that bad.

366
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,700
Speaker 0: I mean, Battletech is Warhammer not so bad, but that's pretty bad.

367
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,486
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

368
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:14,980
Speaker 0: The way we played it was pretty bad.

369
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,106
Speaker 1: The way we played it was bad.

370
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,680
Speaker 1: But if you play it, you know, big real time, it's great.

371
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,460
Speaker 0: No, because then it takes the rest of your life.

372
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,199
Speaker 1: Same as Warhammer.

373
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:23,284
Speaker 0: Not now.

374
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:24,252
Speaker 0: Warhammer is a more.

375
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,120
Speaker 0: it's a tighter game.

376
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,040
Speaker 0: I think it's a better game.

377
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,662
Speaker 1: I don't know.

378
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:29,218
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure they're pretty equal games in my eyes.

379
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,000
Speaker 0: Warhammer is more of a tactical and strategic armies around.

380
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:38,040
Speaker 0: And if unless you play make an 80 pound mech and then let's all fight that.

381
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,320
Speaker 1: Yeah.

382
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:41,378
Speaker 1: If you play Battletech, yeah, you're supposed to have like lots of mechs.

383
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,680
Speaker 0: But having lots of mechs bogs down a lot more quickly than the games like Warhammer do.

384
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,571
Speaker 0: It's not fun.

385
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:47,260
Speaker 0: It doesn't work.

386
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,740
Speaker 1: Well, it's also the difference between, you know, the squad based kind of game and the army based kind of game.

387
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,448
Speaker 0: Anyway, Warhammer like these kinds of war games, I feel like the way.

388
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:05,380
Speaker 0: the best way to enjoy them is not so much to care solely about the winning and losing and that like the gameplay mechanics.

389
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,880
Speaker 0: I'm going to make the best possible army to win, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, because while that's fun, the depth of Warhammer is not that great.

390
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,760
Speaker 0: And randomness rears its ugly head on more than one occasion.

391
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,739
Speaker 1: Pretty much all occasions.

392
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:22,360
Speaker 1: Not quite, but as the Warhammer players, if they're if their dice are really good to them, see how many say yes.

393
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:30,960
Speaker 0: But the thing is, the way to truly enjoy these games is to play with an awesome army and know that that army is awesome.

394
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:35,060
Speaker 0: Now, what is more awesome than the Hello Kitty army?

395
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:36,260
Speaker 1: The Cthulhu army?

396
00:21:36,722 --> 00:21:38,100
Speaker 0: I think the Hello Kitty army is better.

397
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,019
Speaker 1: Hello, Cthulhu army.

398
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,220
Speaker 0: Catherine's Hello Kitty Sisters of Battle.

399
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:43,075
Speaker 1: Alrighty.

400
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:49,100
Speaker 0: This is the kind of army where if I had time to play a game like Warhammer, this is the army that I would field.

401
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,520
Speaker 0: Because whether you win or lose, if you're playing with an army like this, that says a lot about you.

402
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:59,580
Speaker 1: Maybe I'd feel a Gundam army or something because I take those robot guys and because I totally be the robot guys.

403
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,800
Speaker 1: How could you not be the robots?

404
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,429
Speaker 0: Do you even know the?

405
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,379
Speaker 0: who are the robots?

406
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,379
Speaker 1: I remember that someone said it before, Tao.

407
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:10,420
Speaker 0: Are the Tyranids from Warhammer or from something else?

408
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:14,979
Speaker 1: Tyranids, Tyranids, they're not from Starcraft.

409
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:18,340
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's some pictures here.

410
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,002
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

411
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:24,100
Speaker 0: But I just feel like this is the utmost expression of everything that Warhammer is and ever should be.

412
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's definitely.

413
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:33,780
Speaker 0: The guy who comes in with the perfect army who has the best statistical chance of winning is not nearly as cool as the guy who comes in with his awesome orc army.

414
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,159
Speaker 0: I just like the orcs.

415
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:37,128
Speaker 1: Yeah.

416
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:37,800
Speaker 1: Alright, so check this out.

417
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,271
Speaker 1: I heard about this website on the.

418
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,100
Speaker 1: I think it was on the tweet this morning.

419
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,759
Speaker 1: I guess it was the tweet from this weekend.

420
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:50,500
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's called the Import Genius and it's not a free website, so you can't really get much use out of it unless you're going to pay.

421
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:56,620
Speaker 1: But what this website does is incredibly interesting and I think I can tie it back to video games.

422
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,480
Speaker 1: What this website does is they access the information from the U.S.

423
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,820
Speaker 1: customs so they know what's being imported into the U.S.

424
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:08,017
Speaker 1: and to who.

425
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,480
Speaker 1: So, for example, you can go to this website and if you paid, you could do like a search, I guess.

426
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:16,580
Speaker 1: And you could say, you know, who imported computers?

427
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:27,100
Speaker 1: And it would say, you know, IBM imported, you know, five crates of, you know, computers to so and so.

428
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:38,580
Speaker 1: Or, you know, the example that I've made me discover this website was Apple imported like 30 something crates of electronic computers to Cupertino.

429
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:40,233
Speaker 1: I wonder what those are.

430
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,725
Speaker 1: New iPhones.

431
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:41,785
Speaker 1: So.

432
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:54,620
Speaker 1: The reason this is interesting for gaming action is because you could see, huh, Nintendo imported, you know, X crates of, you know, DS's.

433
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,487
Speaker 1: Oh, there's new DS's.

434
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,520
Speaker 1: or, you know, Capcom imported to something, something.

435
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:00,452
Speaker 1: All right.

436
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:00,920
Speaker 1: Yeah.

437
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:10,620
Speaker 1: I think that you could definitely, you know, sort of figure out when you know, yeah, you know, you can figure out when new games are going to be imported, when consoles are going to be updated, all that sort of thing.

438
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:24,300
Speaker 1: So I feel like some of the, you know, gaming review sites, you know, or the magazines that the so-called professional gaming media should get accounts on here and keep tabs on what's going on.

439
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,560
Speaker 0: Because I can't afford to kind of some side channel sideband information there.

440
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

441
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:40,100
Speaker 1: I mean, plus you could there's definitely all sorts of cool stuff in there, you know, like, you know, you could see when like sugar is coming in or, you know, corn syrup, sugar is very important because first you get the show.

442
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,763
Speaker 1: Exactly.

443
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:43,800
Speaker 0: And then you get the power and then you get the.

444
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:46,040
Speaker 1: I mean, that there's got to be all sorts.

445
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,140
Speaker 1: I can't even begin to think about all the, you know, interesting stuff.

446
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,072
Speaker 1: You could see whenever like a large shipment of goods comes into the

447
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:53,514
Speaker 1: U.S.,

448
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:55,440
Speaker 1: you know what it is and who's getting it.

449
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:59,680
Speaker 1: And that that is freaking useful information if you are in the right kind of position.

450
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,640
Speaker 0: So it's me, a Mario, I'm not a real doctor.

451
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,059
Speaker 1: Do not let me touch you genitalia.

452
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,315
Speaker 1: OK, that's the old joke is don't let Dr.

453
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:12,220
Speaker 1: Mario touch your genitals.

454
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,119
Speaker 1: He's not a real doctor.

455
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,020
Speaker 0: Where is that joke from?

456
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:14,790
Speaker 1: I forget.

457
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:15,399
Speaker 1: We made it up.

458
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:15,880
Speaker 1: I don't know.

459
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,588
Speaker 0: No, no, no, we didn't.

460
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:17,458
Speaker 0: It was from bash dot org.

461
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:18,218
Speaker 0: Oh, was it?

462
00:25:18,403 --> 00:25:19,159
Speaker 0: That's where I got it from.

463
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:20,016
Speaker 1: It must be.

464
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,344
Speaker 0: All right.

465
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:24,277
Speaker 0: This will be a short show talking about Dr.

466
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:25,020
Speaker 0: Mario.

467
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,141
Speaker 0: Yep.

468
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:29,633
Speaker 1: So there was a WiiWare game that came out yesterday and it's the Dr.

469
00:25:29,674 --> 00:25:31,480
Speaker 1: Mario for the WiiWare.

470
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:35,979
Speaker 1: And I played it and I'm better than everyone I know, a Dr.

471
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:36,260
Speaker 1: Mario.

472
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:37,123
Speaker 0: Yes.

473
00:25:37,324 --> 00:25:40,080
Speaker 0: He's about as good at this as I don't know.

474
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,360
Speaker 0: Some people are in advanced wars.

475
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:42,849
Speaker 1: You know, it's funny.

476
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:44,238
Speaker 1: I remember when I was a kid and Dr.

477
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:50,240
Speaker 1: Mario came out for the Game Boy and for the NES at the same time and they made a big deal out of it.

478
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,660
Speaker 1: There was a big marketing push.

479
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,719
Speaker 0: Oh, there were cartoons between every TV show I watched about Dr.

480
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:05,798
Speaker 1: I remember being in a toy store back in the day when toy stores were amazing and there was a TV screen up in the store and it showed Dr.

481
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,720
Speaker 1: Mario being played on the screen.

482
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,980
Speaker 1: It was like, whoa, whoa.

483
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:12,452
Speaker 1: But I never got Dr.

484
00:26:12,492 --> 00:26:13,180
Speaker 1: Mario as a kid.

485
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:15,320
Speaker 1: Not for the Game Boy, not for the NES.

486
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,920
Speaker 1: I just never got it.

487
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,016
Speaker 1: And I don't think I played Dr.

488
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,860
Speaker 1: Mario until like late high school, early college.

489
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,459
Speaker 1: I just never played it at all.

490
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,539
Speaker 1: It's somehow I'm better than everyone at it.

491
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,335
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

492
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:31,799
Speaker 0: Well, I used to be pretty good at it, but I haven't played it, I don't know, since I was a kid with any regularity.

493
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:32,422
Speaker 0: Yeah.

494
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:35,180
Speaker 0: I focus more on games like Battle Balls or Advanced Wars.

495
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:35,982
Speaker 1: Yeah.

496
00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:39,039
Speaker 1: But the thing about I don't want to sit here and explain how to play Dr.

497
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,814
Speaker 1: Mario, but Dr.

498
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,699
Speaker 1: Mario is a color matching game.

499
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:52,654
Speaker 1: But it's mostly what I like about it is unlike some of the other games, like, say, Tetris and such, it's, you know, when something clears, the stuff sort of falls down

500
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:52,734
Speaker 0: and

501
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:53,717
Speaker 1: the game is

502
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:54,580
Speaker 0: all about

503
00:26:55,041 --> 00:27:00,340
Speaker 1: sort of putting things in a position so that when they fall down, they'll be in a good spot.

504
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:05,520
Speaker 1: So you're looking like you have this sort of deep look ahead in the game that you don't.

505
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,899
Speaker 1: Other games have sort of the more immediate clear the shit out of the way where Dr.

506
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:17,740
Speaker 1: Mario has more of the set up things properly so that when you do clear them out of the way, more stuff gets cleared out of the way afterwards.

507
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,800
Speaker 0: But anyway, let's talk about the WiiWare implementation of this game first.

508
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,718
Speaker 0: I mean, you can play it like normal Dr.

509
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,018
Speaker 0: Mario and it's fun and it works and it's Dr.

510
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,643
Speaker 1: Mario.

511
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:28,700
Speaker 0: It only lets you play one versus one, though.

512
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:29,960
Speaker 0: There's no other mode.

513
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,462
Speaker 1: Yeah.

514
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:35,945
Speaker 1: See, I thought that they were going to have like a full on for people playing regular old playing Dr.

515
00:27:35,985 --> 00:27:38,700
Speaker 1: Mario at the same time, which they could have done, but they didn't do that.

516
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:39,296
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

517
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:43,976
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was hoping for some I didn't know what, but I was hoping for some sort of D.S.

518
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,674
Speaker 0: or some some kind of extra weird mode because there was.

519
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:51,220
Speaker 0: this is the kind of game where they would test like the weird mode to see if it works at all.

520
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,077
Speaker 1: Well, they put in this flash mode and we figured out how the flash mode works is basically you're playing normal Dr.

521
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,540
Speaker 1: Mario, except some of the little goobers on the screen are flashing.

522
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:05,440
Speaker 1: And if you get rid of those flashing ones, you win.

523
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:08,039
Speaker 1: So you only have to get rid of the flashing ones.

524
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:08,568
Speaker 0: That's it.

525
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:09,140
Speaker 1: Yeah.

526
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:09,883
Speaker 1: It's not.

527
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:15,020
Speaker 1: it's actually a pretty good mode because, you know, it allows for quicker gameplay.

528
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:24,160
Speaker 1: And at the same time, it's sort of instead of just trying to clear everything out of the way, it's like, well, you know, why waste your time clearing the whole board?

529
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:27,340
Speaker 1: The goal is to just clear those guys and not anyone else.

530
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,063
Speaker 1: It's like, huh?

531
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:36,442
Speaker 1: And it sort of makes you think in a different way and put your pills in a different way to sort of make a channel like straight down to the to the deep flashing guys.

532
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:45,463
Speaker 0: But the only other thing they really added is this mode where you and all your friends can play at the same time, grabbing pills simultaneously and putting them onto the board.

533
00:28:45,483 --> 00:28:48,640
Speaker 0: And it's kind of a, you know, us versus the game mode.

534
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:50,959
Speaker 0: But it's really not that fun at all.

535
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,282
Speaker 0: Yeah.

536
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:53,740
Speaker 1: They made a co-op mode called like Virus Buster.

537
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:55,257
Speaker 1: And basically it's Dr.

538
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,679
Speaker 1: Mario, except everything is big.

539
00:28:58,281 --> 00:28:58,986
Speaker 1: Right.

540
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:01,060
Speaker 1: And use the Wiimote to point at the screen.

541
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:08,920
Speaker 1: You have a little target and you can grab the pills, you know, sort of with the Wiimote by pointing at them, rotate them and sort of drag them into position.

542
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:14,627
Speaker 1: And what's interesting about this is you can manipulate the pieces that are in like the next area.

543
00:29:14,647 --> 00:29:16,200
Speaker 1: So you can sort of pre flip.

544
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,139
Speaker 0: It's not interesting at all, though, because all you can do is flip them.

545
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:19,701
Speaker 0: That's it.

546
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:20,003
Speaker 1: You can.

547
00:29:20,445 --> 00:29:25,960
Speaker 1: you can also when little bits are like, let's say I clear out some horizontal stuff and a stop on top is falling.

548
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:37,298
Speaker 1: When something starts falling, you can sort of grab it and move it, which allows, you know, a lot more flexible options there in terms of, you know, where you can move pieces rather than just, you know, if something's falling, it falls where it is.

549
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:46,780
Speaker 1: And when you're dragging the pieces around to position them, you can't drag them up, but you can drag them left or right through other pieces, which is sort of tricky.

550
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:49,558
Speaker 1: You know, it's not something you can usually do in a normal Dr.

551
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,301
Speaker 1: Mario game.

552
00:29:50,983 --> 00:29:59,998
Speaker 1: So that sort of gives you options of of ways to be able to have four people, you know, sort of collectively trying to beat the Dr.

553
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,662
Speaker 1: Mario.

554
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:03,280
Speaker 0: I mean, it escalates a little bit or it'll get faster.

555
00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:05,900
Speaker 0: Then it gives you two or three pills at the same time or two or three.

556
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,706
Speaker 0: We're not going to be around the bush.

557
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:10,260
Speaker 0: The end result is that it's really not that fun.

558
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:11,760
Speaker 0: It's kind of broken.

559
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,186
Speaker 0: It's just there's.

560
00:30:13,407 --> 00:30:15,380
Speaker 0: you'll play it once or twice and you'll never play it again.

561
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:25,084
Speaker 1: The reason it's not fun is because if you play it by yourself, right, just one person, it's pretty much impossible because you can't handle three pills at a time when you're only one person.

562
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:28,139
Speaker 1: And it's no, you might as well just play regular Dr.

563
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,207
Speaker 1: Mario, which is better.

564
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,860
Speaker 1: And if you have multiple people.

565
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:31,424
Speaker 1: Right.

566
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,419
Speaker 1: First of all, you want to be just playing normal Dr.

567
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,489
Speaker 1: Mario against each other.

568
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:35,440
Speaker 1: You don't want to be doing this.

569
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,160
Speaker 1: And second of all, what is happening is the everyone's cooperating.

570
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,720
Speaker 1: But really what you're doing is just hindering each other.

571
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,124
Speaker 1: Like one guy will try to put something in one spot and someone else will be trying to do the same thing.

572
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:53,143
Speaker 1: But the end result is like they both push the button and then it ends in the wrong position.

573
00:30:53,203 --> 00:30:57,946
Speaker 1: And it's really basically everyone just gets in everyone's away and then you lose.

574
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,480
Speaker 1: And it's really frustrating.

575
00:31:00,623 --> 00:31:02,500
Speaker 1: And it's like you're all trying to cooperate.

576
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,380
Speaker 1: But by trying to cooperate, you end up screwing each other, which is very, very upsetting.

577
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:16,020
Speaker 1: It's not like, say, four swords, you know, where, you know, you any any harm you do to each other is sort of intentional and silly.

578
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,603
Speaker 1: It's it's.

579
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:21,000
Speaker 1: it's very upsetting that you're all actually trying to cooperate.

580
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,784
Speaker 1: Yet you end up just dicking each other over and getting pissed off and then not wanting to play anymore.

581
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:30,839
Speaker 0: A much better way to play seems to be to sit there with a Wiimote in each hand and play it by yourself.

582
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:32,170
Speaker 1: That's an OK mode.

583
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:33,099
Speaker 0: That's actually kind of fun.

584
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:33,882
Speaker 0: That's it.

585
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:37,257
Speaker 1: Actually, I played the Wi-Fi because it lets you play Dr.

586
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:38,744
Speaker 1: Mario against people online.

587
00:31:38,765 --> 00:31:41,318
Speaker 1: And I think it's the first time you've ever been able to play Dr.

588
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:42,043
Speaker 1: Mario online.

589
00:31:42,063 --> 00:31:42,485
Speaker 1: You know what?

590
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,840
Speaker 1: It worked and it was kind of good.

591
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:45,748
Speaker 0: It's well done.

592
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:46,699
Speaker 0: It works just fine.

593
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,624
Speaker 1: You know, I was going to say I seem to remember that, you know, the Tetris DS was like the online game.

594
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:54,960
Speaker 1: I played more than any other online game, at least for the DS.

595
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,843
Speaker 1: Or were we?

596
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:57,267
Speaker 1: And this Dr.

597
00:31:57,307 --> 00:32:06,682
Speaker 1: Mario, I think that the dropping pieces puzzle game is definitely like the kind of game that Nintendo gets right with it, with the Internet action.

598
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:13,139
Speaker 0: Of course, at the same time, the original, you know, you play this game on the NES or whatever with your friends.

599
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,468
Speaker 0: And while it's a versus game, it's it's.

600
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:16,472
Speaker 0: it's not really.

601
00:32:16,492 --> 00:32:19,165
Speaker 0: it's more of a. you're both racing to the finish.

602
00:32:19,185 --> 00:32:20,860
Speaker 0: There's very little interaction between the players.

603
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:30,181
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not like, well, battle balls, because I mentioned it earlier, where it's this whole game of timing combos to cancel out the other person's combos and then combo them.

604
00:32:30,724 --> 00:32:34,520
Speaker 0: Your combos do very little and there's almost no variation in what they do.

605
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,104
Speaker 1: So your combos do so.

606
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:42,820
Speaker 0: if you get a big combo, combos do is is determine basically who got the combo first, slightly inconveniences the other person.

607
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:44,359
Speaker 0: So it rewards you for speed.

608
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:49,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time, the combos can actually might not even do damage at all.

609
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,617
Speaker 1: Like you might drop two bits on the other guy's board that actually help him out and make it easier for him.

610
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,360
Speaker 1: So so, yeah, there's not too much.

611
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,079
Speaker 0: I just I more enjoy games where there's more direct competition like warlords.

612
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:02,682
Speaker 1: Yeah.

613
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:03,145
Speaker 1: Yeah.

614
00:33:03,265 --> 00:33:05,478
Speaker 0: Or battle balls, even though I'm awful at it.

615
00:33:06,122 --> 00:33:07,107
Speaker 1: I just enjoy Dr.

616
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:13,460
Speaker 1: Mario more if I played against someone who was actually as good as me, which is actually why the Wi-Fi comes in handy, because everyone here is no good.

617
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,002
Speaker 1: Yeah.

618
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:14,223
Speaker 0: Yeah.

619
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:14,626
Speaker 0: Yeah.

620
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,480
Speaker 0: Welcome to the advanced wars world of Rim.

621
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's weird.

622
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,260
Speaker 1: It's like I don't understand why other people aren't good.

623
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,120
Speaker 1: Like I look at it and it is sort of obvious where to put the pieces.

624
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:25,064
Speaker 1: I don't understand.

625
00:33:25,346 --> 00:33:27,901
Speaker 0: Well, I guess the listeners left to play you and prove that you're wrong.

626
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:28,284
Speaker 1: Yeah.

627
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:29,917
Speaker 1: Let's let's do the friend codes for Dr.

628
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:30,219
Speaker 1: Mario.

629
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,206
Speaker 0: We probably still.

630
00:33:31,247 --> 00:33:32,518
Speaker 1: I've been meaning to fix the I.D.

631
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,219
Speaker 1: share thing and I kind of suck at it.

632
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,006
Speaker 0: But you even you skip these games, you're going to work on stuff and playing games, other games.

633
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:40,900
Speaker 1: I know.

634
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,083
Speaker 0: I know it's like games, write code or play games and not pretend you're going to write code.

635
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:46,794
Speaker 1: I don't have enough time to do.

636
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:47,560
Speaker 1: I need to do both.

637
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,092
Speaker 1: I don't have enough time.

638
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:49,999
Speaker 1: I should just not sleep.

639
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:50,465
Speaker 1: Yeah.

640
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:51,719
Speaker 1: Yeah.

641
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,359
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know how worth it this game is to you unless unless you already like Dr.

642
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,024
Speaker 0: Mario.

643
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:57,219
Speaker 0: I wouldn't bother to be honest.

644
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:57,620
Speaker 1: Yeah.

645
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:58,505
Speaker 1: This game is like.

646
00:33:58,826 --> 00:34:01,319
Speaker 1: I think this is really only worth it for fans of Dr.

647
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:01,560
Speaker 1: Mario.

648
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,303
Speaker 1: If you're not a Dr.

649
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:04,695
Speaker 1: Mario person, you probably it's not worth.

650
00:34:04,755 --> 00:34:05,700
Speaker 1: I think it's like 10 bucks.

651
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,021
Speaker 1: Right.

652
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:06,121
Speaker 1: Yeah.

653
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:07,749
Speaker 0: If you're not sure if you're a Dr.

654
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,016
Speaker 0: Mario fan, just get a rom.

655
00:34:09,136 --> 00:34:09,599
Speaker 0: play Dr.

656
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:10,221
Speaker 0: Mario on the end.

657
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:10,502
Speaker 0: Yes.

658
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:10,743
Speaker 1: Yeah.

659
00:34:10,763 --> 00:34:11,446
Speaker 1: Play some Dr.

660
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:14,257
Speaker 1: Mario before you actually buy Dr.

661
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:24,087
Speaker 1: Mario to know if you if it's a game that you're going to like and play a hell of a lot because I can actually see myself playing the Wi-Fi version of this, you know, quite a bit when there's no other Wii games to play.

662
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:27,025
Speaker 0: See, though, that's that's the I guess the biggest failing of Dr.

663
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,331
Speaker 0: Mario that never got.

664
00:34:28,472 --> 00:34:31,063
Speaker 0: I guess I'm sad that they never added something to it to add this.

665
00:34:31,123 --> 00:34:43,379
Speaker 0: But whenever you talk about a game like Battle Balls or all those other like puzzle games, there's always the stories from the heyday of man, that one game where I totally blah, blah, blah, 100 combo, blah, blah, blah, blah.

666
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:52,800
Speaker 0: You have like these battle stories of the times you won by some crazy fluke or the times you lost because the other person had this gigantic combo, like the combo of the gods.

667
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,449
Speaker 0: But there's none of that in Dr.

668
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:00,010
Speaker 1: Mario because people who are much better than me can set up huge combos, but they're not epic.

669
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,463
Speaker 0: They don't do much in the game other than they're cool to watch.

670
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:05,579
Speaker 0: But they're not you know, they're not memorable like some other games are.

671
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,026
Speaker 0: They don't hit the other guy.

672
00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:07,669
Speaker 0: They're not like this.

673
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:08,895
Speaker 0: Everything explodes.

674
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:12,129
Speaker 0: They're just, oh, I beat the game very cleverly and very quickly.

675
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,772
Speaker 0: And I've won.

676
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:20,847
Speaker 1: Now we will continue as another game because it's mostly a game of slowly chewing away all the viruses rather than blowing the hell out of them really quickly.

677
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:25,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no timing element at all in terms of get the combo, don't get the combo.

678
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:26,252
Speaker 0: There's none of that.

679
00:35:26,473 --> 00:35:27,820
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't have that action.

680
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:28,602
Speaker 0: I don't know.

681
00:35:28,642 --> 00:35:30,251
Speaker 0: You never hear people talking about their Dr.

682
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:34,367
Speaker 0: Mario war stories, but a lot of people have puzzled upon war stories.

683
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,496
Speaker 1: Actually, one thing about Dr.

684
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:38,599
Speaker 1: Mario is Dr.

685
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:41,554
Speaker 1: Mario has really good music and they've added a few new musics to it.

686
00:35:41,594 --> 00:35:45,513
Speaker 1: And I don't like them as much as I like the old musics, the old remixes of the old.

687
00:35:45,814 --> 00:35:47,040
Speaker 0: No, no, that's in flash mode.

688
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:52,062
Speaker 1: No, there's a because they have, you know, fever and chill, but they added, I think, cough and sneeze.

689
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:52,383
Speaker 1: Right.

690
00:35:52,944 --> 00:36:00,126
Speaker 1: And I didn't realize it until just recently that the songs, the original songs and Dr.

691
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,391
Speaker 1: Mario were fever and chill.

692
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:05,851
Speaker 1: And I didn't realize that the reason they were called fever and chill is because it goes with the theme of Dr.

693
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:06,534
Speaker 1: Mario fever.

694
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:09,546
Speaker 0: Are you kidding?

695
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:12,639
Speaker 1: And then the caught the fact that they added cough and sneeze.

696
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:13,863
Speaker 0: You're not kidding.

697
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:14,566
Speaker 0: You're not.

698
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:15,408
Speaker 0: You're not.

699
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:17,355
Speaker 0: I thought this was a joke.

700
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:24,276
Speaker 1: No, the fact that they added cough and sneeze, I said, oh, the songs are named after symptoms.

701
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:28,556
Speaker 0: This is just like that time when you realized that the Beatles isn't spelled like the bug.

702
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:30,104
Speaker 0: It's spelled like a beat in music.

703
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:31,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't realize that for a long time.

704
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:33,844
Speaker 0: Well, you probably don't know the answer to this then.

705
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:35,430
Speaker 0: What are the names of the three bugs?

706
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:38,181
Speaker 1: The three things in Dr.

707
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:38,783
Speaker 1: Mario?

708
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,246
Speaker 1: The three viruses?

709
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:41,289
Speaker 1: Red, blue and yellow.

710
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:43,174
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

711
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:44,638
Speaker 1: I don't know.

712
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,323
Speaker 1: Annoying, annoying and more annoying.

713
00:36:46,524 --> 00:36:48,009
Speaker 0: Fever, chill and weird.

714
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:48,811
Speaker 1: Really?

715
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:49,293
Speaker 1: Really.

716
00:36:50,457 --> 00:36:51,802
Speaker 0: Oh, I think red was fever.

717
00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:52,989
Speaker 0: Yellow was definitely weird.

718
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,478
Speaker 0: Red had to be fever and blue was chill.

719
00:36:54,498 --> 00:36:55,061
Speaker 0: That makes sense.

720
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:56,146
Speaker 1: Yeah, totally makes sense.

721
00:36:56,367 --> 00:37:00,022
Speaker 0: I could look it up, I guess, but I'm 99% certain that's how it was.

722
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:00,986
Speaker 0: Huh?

723
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,050
Speaker 1: That's interesting.

724
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:04,058
Speaker 1: See, it's weird because like Dr.

725
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:07,090
Speaker 1: Mario sort of has like this mystic lore to it in a way.

726
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:10,343
Speaker 0: One piece of lore and we've already revealed it to the world.

727
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:10,927
Speaker 1: Yeah.

728
00:37:11,288 --> 00:37:12,435
Speaker 1: Another thing about this new Dr.

729
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:15,311
Speaker 1: Mario is that it incorporates the me's a little bit, which is pretty fun.

730
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:20,777
Speaker 1: Like when you win and you see your me wearing a lab coat and a stethoscope dancing and like pumping his fist, that's good times.

731
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:21,139
Speaker 0: Ha ha.

732
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,143
Speaker 0: Fist pound.

733
00:37:22,524 --> 00:37:23,809
Speaker 1: Fist pump, not fist pound.

734
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,117
Speaker 0: Yes, but the Joker's fist pound.

735
00:37:26,137 --> 00:37:27,542
Speaker 0: I can't say fist, yeah, anyway.

736
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:28,304
Speaker 0: Anyway.

737
00:37:28,504 --> 00:37:29,066
Speaker 0: Anyway.

738
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:47,325
Speaker 1: Anyway, in general, I like the falling block puzzle games and I really think that they're some of the best video games from a gameplay perspective because they incorporate the quick thinking, the pattern recognition and the rapid hand-eye coordination action all into one game.

739
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:51,865
Speaker 0: See, I feel like the most important aspect is just the direct abstracted competition.

740
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:55,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, that definitely is a bonus added on top, but.

741
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:59,011
Speaker 0: And I think we're really stretching trying to talk about Dr.

742
00:37:59,071 --> 00:37:59,693
Speaker 0: Mario.

743
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:00,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

744
00:38:00,496 --> 00:38:05,478
Speaker 1: We were going to talk about sort of falling block, you know, puzzle-y games in the genre.

745
00:38:05,498 --> 00:38:06,843
Speaker 0: But apparently we already did that show.

746
00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:08,669
Speaker 1: We already did that show like two years ago.

747
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:08,769
Speaker 0: In 2006.

748
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:14,211
Speaker 1: So we can't do that show again, so we had to talk about just Dr.

749
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:14,753
Speaker 1: Mario.

750

Speaker 0: Yep.

753
00:38:25,357 --> 00:38:27,521

756
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:48,294
Speaker 0: We say feeds plural because Geek Nights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

757
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:50,423
Speaker 0: Mondays are science and technology.

758
00:38:50,463 --> 00:38:53,114
Speaker 0: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

759
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:58,957
Speaker 0: Wednesdays are anime manga comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

Speaker 1: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com.

Speaker 1: Or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

762
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,018

767
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:37,220
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

768
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,760
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
