1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,240
Speaker 1: It's Monday, November 16th, 2015, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,330
Speaker 1: Tonight, we're talking about why we don't actually care that much about traditional tech news anymore.

3
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,688
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:36,990
Speaker 1: So, uh, I'm a fan of Civ V because I fly a lot, and it's a game that I can play on a laptop for like eight hours in a row and not even really notice the time went by.

5
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what happened to me Saturday.

6
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,690
Speaker 0: I don't play Civilization that often.

7
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,250
Speaker 0: I played Civ II a lot back in the day.

8
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:43,909
Speaker 0: I bought Civ III when it came out, but I didn't play it too much.

9
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,398
Speaker 1: Yep, it was pretty much the weakest one.

10
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:46,950
Speaker 1: Well, IV might have been the weakest one, actually.

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,374
Speaker 0: Civ IV, I played moderately.

12
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:53,310
Speaker 0: Civ V, I played, you know, a bit, and then I didn't play it for a long time.

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,662
Speaker 1: But then when you turn it on, you're like, "All right, move my settler,".

14
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:57,070
Speaker 1: and then the next thing you know, it tanks.

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,535
Speaker 0: So it sucks when someone reminds you that it exists.

16
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:02,843
Speaker 0: It's like, "Install, start, and my day is lost.

17
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:03,284
Speaker 0: Thanks,

18
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,149
Speaker 0: Saturday.".

19
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:21,570
Speaker 1: So I've always wanted to play against humans, but there's problems with that, and the reason I talk about this on a Monday is because Civ V, the game, either from Civ V itself or through Steam, has no real multiplayer capabilities.

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:28,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, the multiplayer for all Civ games has always been very poorly implemented or not at all implemented.

21
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,370
Speaker 1: It doesn't work that well.

22
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:58,449
Speaker 0: Basically, people who have played Civ multiplayer have always basically played the game, played one turn, saved it, sent the save file to someone else who opened it, played a turn, saved it, sent the save file to someone else who played a turn, and so on, and there was sort of an honor system, like you don't mess up, and, you know, obviously if someone sends you a game where I obviously took a whole bunch of turns, it's like, "Uh, send me a different file, bro," and you can always go back to the person, you know, because everyone's keeping their files, right?

23
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,430
Speaker 0: So you can always go back to the last person who didn't cheat and get their file and what, you know.

24
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:16,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically, I've always wanted to play with people, but it really never works out, or at best, you hot seat at someone's house for a while, so the best solution to a technology problem is the one that actually works and someone deploys, no matter how janky it is.

25
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,690
Speaker 0: Right, so there is a thing built into Civ V called Pit Boss, which lets you take turns, you know, occasionally.

26
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:25,049
Speaker 1: I have almost gotten that to work.

27
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,109
Speaker 0: And there's, you know, you can obviously play in real-time multiplayer, which kind of works, but you're sitting around- Until it crashes, and then your game's fucked.

28
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:38,407
Speaker 0: And you're also sitting around waiting for people to take their turn, like, in real-time, so everyone's killing more than a Saturday all at once, and that's just like, "Oh, it's the

29
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:38,669
Speaker 0: worst.".

30
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:46,410
Speaker 1: So, Giant Multiplayer Robot is a website, and it basically solves this problem in the simplest way possible.

31
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:59,650
Speaker 1: All it does is you take your turn, and then it says, "Oh, you took your turn," and you save it, and it automatically uploads it with all the passwords and all the stuff, and just passes it to the next person, and it manages all the glue between those.

32
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:03,528
Speaker 1: So, like, when I get- it tells me, it pops up my desktop, like, "It's your

33
00:03:03,588 --> 00:03:03,870
Speaker 1: turn!"

34
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,303
Speaker 1: And I have 48 hours to take my turn, and I click, and it launches Civ V,

35
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:09,165
Speaker 0: and I

36
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:15,508
Speaker 1: go and say, "Load game," and there's just one file sitting there, and that file says, "GMR, play this

37
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:15,890
Speaker 1: one.".

38
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:21,888
Speaker 1: I click on it, I take my turn, I hit save, and then it pops up and says, "Hey, looks like you just took a

39
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:22,169
Speaker 1: turn!"

40
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:23,430
Speaker 1: And it lets me submit it.

41
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,410
Speaker 0: What if I don't hit save, and I instead load after I don't like my turn and take my turn again?

42
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,068
Speaker 1: That's all you!

43
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,550
Speaker 0: And then I click load and take my turn again, and click load and take my turn again, until I like how my turn came out, and then hit save.

44
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:46,410
Speaker 1: If you have to do that, one, there aren't random seeds, so if you do an attack, it's gonna go the same fucking way every time, like- But I can test out, like, what if my warrior goes first?

45
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,110
Speaker 0: What if my spearman goes first?

46
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,190
Speaker 1: The game tells you what'll happen, just look at the rules.

47
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,869
Speaker 0: It tells you approximately what will happen, it'd be like, you know, slight victory, it's like, "Hmm, I wonder if this slight victory is better than that slight

48
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:58,030
Speaker 0: victory.".

49
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,230
Speaker 1: Scott, if you need to do that, good luck, have fun, and I hope that GMR doesn't do something to you.

50
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:11,129
Speaker 0: Also, you know, it is Civ 5, right, so I can, like, press enter, and then sort of, like, see, you know, maybe some information will come in.

51
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:13,929
Speaker 1: No, you've never played Hot Seed in Civ, have you?

52
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:15,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, what happens?

53
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,589
Speaker 1: So, when you're done with your turn, in normal Hot Seed, pretend it's not GMR.

54
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,548
Speaker 0: Oh, we're all in the same house.

55
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're all in the same house, so I take my turn, right, I hit done.

56
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:29,670
Speaker 1: It pops up, it goes to a blank screen with a dialogue that shows the name of the next player's turn, and they gotta type in their fucking password.

57
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:30,829
Speaker 0: Password?

58
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:31,895
Speaker 1: Whoa!

59
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:39,910
Speaker 1: Now, GMR handles that, you don't have to do anything, but if you do normal Hot Seed, when you start the game, you put in a password that's just for your turn.

60
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:41,135
Speaker 0: Whoa!

61
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:43,670
Speaker 0: So, if you try, you can't see anyone else's turn?

62
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:43,976
Speaker 0: Nope!

63
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:44,652
Speaker 1: Oh!

64
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:50,167
Speaker 1: I guess you can sit there and try to guess my password, and everyone's like, "Scott, why do you keep

65
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:50,649
Speaker 1: typing?".

66
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:58,090
Speaker 0: Now, I do have the entire save file available, I don't think it's encrypted in any way, and even if it was, I have to be able to decrypt it to load the game.

67
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:05,730
Speaker 0: I could inspect that save file and then basically infer, or not even infer, look at all the data by cheating that way.

68
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:13,290
Speaker 1: You may or may not be able to, I have not looked into this, the only thing I know is that a lot of people- Does it encrypt different parts of the save file with those passwords?

69
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:21,769
Speaker 1: All I know is that the people who play Civ 5 and care about it, like, way beyond us, they use the thing that we're gonna use for their for serious games.

70
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,650
Speaker 0: I think I can inspect that save file and figure out, like, what your build, what wonders you're building, or what units you have.

71
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,710
Speaker 1: I'm gonna look at my save file and see what I can figure out, 'cause I'm playing another game of this, testing it.

72
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's see if you can Google search for, like, Civ 5 save file structure.

73
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,991
Speaker 1: But, the reason I bring this anecdote up- Because

74
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:51,030
Speaker 0: apparently this robot thing must be able to tell when your save file has taken a turn, and it might be doing it with just, like, the timestamp or this checksum changing, but it could also be doing it by actually looking in the file and seeing, like, the turn number somewhere or something.

75
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:57,510
Speaker 1: But from a technology standpoint, the correct way to do this is to have a server that manages everything within the game.

76
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I don't have access to the save file, the server could just send me the specific information that's available to me, and not any other information.

77
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,410
Speaker 1: But, the reality is that that system is so complicated that they've never been able to- Like, Pit Boss and all those things don't work that well.

78
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,710
Speaker 0: No one's gonna spend the time- Because no one's ever made the Civ game with multiplayer as the first priority.

79
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,410
Speaker 0: They make a single player game and they add on some multiplayer.

80
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:21,249
Speaker 0: They don't think multiplayer first.

81
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:34,690
Speaker 1: So, if there is a solution to your problem that involves writing a dirty script that gets the job done, versus, uh, engineering the general case, nine times out of ten you just want to do the thing that works and move on.

82
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,830
Speaker 0: Also, I'm not good enough to beat at Civ to win even if I was able to cheat in this matter.

83
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:47,189
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, do you think I am- I'm playing my first game against humans- But you played a lot of Civ V on planes, I haven't played- Against AIs, let me tell you, AIs- I can't even beat the AI, though.

84
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,430
Speaker 0: Well- On prince mode.

85
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,287
Speaker 1: God help you.

86
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,588
Speaker 1: Well, if you get a religion before everyone else and make one, make your god and then get him to help you.

87
00:06:57,071 --> 00:07:01,070
Speaker 0: I was- I did actually- that's the one thing I did well at when we played on Saturday.

88
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:02,390
Speaker 0: I still lost, though.

89
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,730
Speaker 1: I did go and Civ V you, but not to turn this into a Tuesday show.

90
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,570
Speaker 1: You can't just do everything like in old Civs.

91
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,221
Speaker 1: You can't be like, "I'm just gonna build everything.

92
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:10,067
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do

93
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:10,470
Speaker 1: everything.".

94
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,988
Speaker 1: You gotta be like, "Am I gonna push this religion thing right now or am I gonna push

95
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:14,450
Speaker 1: science?".

96
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,470
Speaker 1: You only get to pick one.

97
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:18,150
Speaker 0: But if you push religion, then you can use faith to buy stuff.

98
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,010
Speaker 0: It's like every avenue you go will help you in another avenue, so you don't have to do everything.

99
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:32,030
Speaker 0: It's like if you're super religious, you buy everything with your faith, and it doesn't matter that your production is so low, because you just bought things with belief.

100
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,910
Speaker 0: Some spearman- you don't have to build a spearman.

101
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,290
Speaker 0: Some guy will be his own spearman, because he believes in the Skyman.

102
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:40,690
Speaker 1: Depending on how you make your Skyman.

103
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,229
Speaker 1: Sometimes I make a science Skyman.

104
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,228
Speaker 0: You can do that.

105
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,470
Speaker 0: You can make a science Skyman.

106
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:51,430
Speaker 0: You can make no Skyman at all and instead use the resources you would have spent on Skyman to get money and buy things with money.

107
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,430
Speaker 0: Or just research science and just be better, because you have science.

108
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you got all this science.

109
00:07:58,091 --> 00:07:59,730
Speaker 1: I got a whole bunch of spearman.

110
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:00,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

111
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,510
Speaker 0: I have science.

112
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,430
Speaker 0: I have a musketman.

113
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,549
Speaker 1: You've got one musketman.

114
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,050
Speaker 0: I'll shoot your spearman in the face.

115
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got one musketman.

116
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,250
Speaker 1: I got like 40 spearman.

117
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,630
Speaker 0: Who says I have one musketman?

118
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:10,810
Speaker 0: I could just do science and production.

119
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,430
Speaker 1: If you also have 40 musketmen, then you don't have anything else.

120
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:15,890
Speaker 0: I spent all my money.

121
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,729
Speaker 0: I'm in super debt.

122
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:18,748
Speaker 0: I also ate all the food.

123
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,270
Speaker 1: In the news, I got a bunch of little news that are kind of relevant to tech, that are interesting and vaguely relevant almost to the show.

124
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,150
Speaker 1: So one, I was going to go on the line here.

125
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,869
Speaker 1: This is actually kind of important news, because up till this point, we can only assume these things.

126
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:40,448
Speaker 1: Tim Cook said straight up, Apple is not converging and has no plans to ever converge the MacBook line and the iPad line.

127
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:45,690
Speaker 1: They're not going to run iOS, like OS X for real on the same devices.

128
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,047
Speaker 0: So I mean that, you know, how long does that mean?

129
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:49,300
Speaker 0: A year out?

130
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:52,229
Speaker 1: I would guess that means at least three or four years.

131
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:52,990
Speaker 1: I don't know.

132
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,530
Speaker 1: Unless Tim Cook gets like pushed out or something.

133
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,950
Speaker 0: I don't see that as being like.

134
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:04,370
Speaker 1: But it's interesting because the rationale he gives, basically as to age is my biggest fears about Apple.

135
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:13,030
Speaker 1: My biggest fear was that they were going to merge those and get rid of their desktop, like super platforms, and just basically make all computers stupid and consumptive.

136
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,349
Speaker 1: And instead they've at least he has said that they're not going to do that.

137
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,470
Speaker 1: They're going to make the iPad for, you know, normal fun stuff and regular people.

138
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:25,630
Speaker 1: And they're going to keep making the MacBook Pro for actually doing things.

139
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:30,567
Speaker 0: Listen, I got this giant iPad, which I'll geek by right now, actually, because that's how I was going to do.

140
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm curious how your experience is.

141
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:38,718
Speaker 1: I was like, I need an iPad and I'm pretty much 50/50 between what you're holding in your hand right now and the iPad Air.

142
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,369
Speaker 0: So we just got the iPad Air to work.

143
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,470
Speaker 1: So I can tell you about that, too, because I'm going to get the Xperia Z5 and go with tiny phone.

144
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,209
Speaker 1: So I need a tablet now.

145
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,650
Speaker 0: OK, so I used to have the iPad Mini, but it broke and it broke in a bullshit way.

146
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,249
Speaker 0: I think like the GPU was fried or something because like the screen wouldn't turn on, even though it's otherwise perfect.

147
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,530
Speaker 1: Let's take it to Apple Care and they'll fix it.

148
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,710
Speaker 0: No, I didn't pay for Apple Care and they refused.

149
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,149
Speaker 0: And no, no repair place or Apple would do anything for me.

150
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:10,369
Speaker 0: Oh, so if anyone wants an iPad Mini that works, but the screen doesn't turn on, let me know.

151
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,250
Speaker 0: It's an iPad Mini, too, with the retina screen.

152
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,810
Speaker 0: It's still like perfectly great.

153
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:24,370
Speaker 0: The only problem with that iPad Mini, my mistake, not only random breaking for no reason, but it was only 16 gigs of space, which is not enough.

154
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,969
Speaker 0: If you get an iOS device, you have to get the big storage.

155
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:32,270
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's like you're just going to fill it up with your apps and then you're fucked.

156
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:32,750
Speaker 0: Right.

157
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,350
Speaker 0: And it's bullshit that they even make those.

158
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:43,166
Speaker 1: And obviously it's also bullshit because if they didn't make those, the sticker price that people think of when they think of iPad is way higher than what they normally think of.

159
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:43,428
Speaker 1: Right.

160
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,589
Speaker 0: Also, it's you know, this is the same for every Apple device.

161
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:47,769
Speaker 0: They stiff you.

162
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:50,290
Speaker 0: If it's an iOS device, they stiff you on the storage.

163
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:52,549
Speaker 0: And if it's a Mac, they stiff you on the RAM.

164
00:10:53,411 --> 00:11:01,310
Speaker 0: I can go and buy like a 256 gig SD card on Amazon for not a lot of money, like less than 100 bucks, probably.

165
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,221
Speaker 0: The price difference is, you know, 128 gig iPad.

166
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:09,770
Speaker 0: And I think like the 32 is like hundreds of dollars.

167
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,570
Speaker 0: It's like, go fuck yourself.

168
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,689
Speaker 0: But there's nothing you can do about it because it's not like it's a slot on here.

169
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,969
Speaker 0: And you can't like open it up and put an SD card in there.

170
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:22,670
Speaker 0: It's flash memory that's been on the board.

171
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,264
Speaker 0: You can't.

172
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,348
Speaker 0: There's no, you know.

173
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,070
Speaker 0: So you just got to pay and deal with it for the, you know, get ripped off.

174
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,249
Speaker 1: Well, I just looked now to make sure.

175
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:36,847
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I, we ask an average person actually do this, ask just random people what an iPhone costs.

176
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,168
Speaker 1: Just ask them and see what they say.

177
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:42,310
Speaker 1: Because if you want the biggest, like if you want an iPhone with the most storage.

178
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:42,863
Speaker 0: Yeah.

179
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,910
Speaker 0: So what's the biggest iPhone 6 you can get?

180
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,230
Speaker 0: It's a thousand dollars.

181
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,970
Speaker 0: The 128 gig is a thousand.

182
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,491
Speaker 0: It's 949.

183
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:52,750
Speaker 0: And you're still selling the 16, right?

184
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,990
Speaker 1: So what's 750.

185
00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:04,590
Speaker 0: So $250 for 116 gigs of flash storage, 116 gigs for $250.

186
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:09,510
Speaker 0: You know how many, how much SD card you can get for $250?

187
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,410
Speaker 0: You might be able to get a terabyte of storage with $250.

188
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,990
Speaker 1: But if the average person says, what's an iPhone cost?

189
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,930
Speaker 1: A thousand dollars.

190
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,430
Speaker 1: Then that iPhone does not become viable and people might end up paying a thousand dollars.

191
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:26,390
Speaker 1: But that's because they think it's only going to cost them 700 and something.

192
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:27,105
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

193
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,590
Speaker 0: The thing is going to cost them 100 and there's some subsidy, but all the carriers stop doing that.

194
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:30,746
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,310
Speaker 1: Nowadays they think, well, even now I went to go to Apple's website to buy one.

196
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,910
Speaker 1: It doesn't actually show that price in the forefront.

197
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,897
Speaker 1: It says 3745 a month.

198
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:43,590
Speaker 0: Well, they do have, for iPhones, they actually just started this really good, uh, plan.

199
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:49,907
Speaker 0: Where you basically lease your iPhone and you pay monthly for it and you keep paying monthly for it.

200
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:59,270
Speaker 0: And then the advantage of this plan is that every single year, not every two years, every year, you can just give them your back, your iPhone and get the brand new ones.

201
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,370
Speaker 0: You can go six, six S seven, seven S eight, eight S every single year.

202
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,790
Speaker 0: Just give them your old one, get a new one and just keep paying monthly.

203
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,041
Speaker 0: And you'll always have the newest phone all the time.

204
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:16,610
Speaker 0: as opposed to what I'm doing, which is what I've been doing up until now, which is buy the new phone every two years.

205
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:20,210
Speaker 0: Keep it when the S phone comes out, because it's not really that reason.

206
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,570
Speaker 0: You know, you know, and I basically I did the math.

207
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:32,190
Speaker 0: I'll be saving a slight amount of money doing it the leasing way and I'll be getting a new phone every year instead of every two years.

208
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,427
Speaker 1: So it's actually not about what I've been doing is I've only bought like.

209
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:45,590
Speaker 0: it is a bad deal for the people, which is a lot of people I know, which is who get an iPhone and keep it for more than two years and just keep on keeping it until the very last possible second.

210
00:13:45,713 --> 00:13:46,369
Speaker 0: They get a new one.

211
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,570
Speaker 1: Well, what I've been doing, I do that with Android.

212
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,909
Speaker 1: I basically buy a generation old phone and hold on to it for fucking ever.

213
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:53,788
Speaker 0: That will dip.

214
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,770
Speaker 0: If you buy by like an iPhone five, see like you'll be good for so long.

215
00:13:57,954 --> 00:13:58,021
Speaker 1: Yup.

216
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,390
Speaker 1: Well, no, like so my phone now is still an old Nexus five.

217
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:01,908
Speaker 1: And you know what?

218
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,070
Speaker 1: It's still the best Android phone out effectively.

219
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,469
Speaker 1: But it's a giant iPad.

220
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,049
Speaker 0: It's so my iPad mini died.

221
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:11,970
Speaker 0: So when I bought the giant iPad, I also paid the hundred dollar rip off for Apple Care.

222
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:13,470
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

223
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:25,130
Speaker 0: Because if I spend a thousand dollars in a giant iPad, I fully expect to keep this for many, many moons and did not have to use any other kinds of things.

224
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:25,426
Speaker 0: Right.

225
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,770
Speaker 0: So the goal here is I'm not going to use my Lenovo laptop anymore.

226
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:30,390
Speaker 0: And you know what?

227
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:34,390
Speaker 0: With the giant iPad, I don't really need to use that Lenovo.

228
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,013
Speaker 0: Can you?

229
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:37,090
Speaker 1: you can't place it five on it, can you?

230
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:40,790
Speaker 1: No, but I can play Hearthstone because I can place it five on my laptop.

231
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,490
Speaker 0: You want to play some Tigris and Euphrates on this motherfucker?

232
00:14:43,911 --> 00:14:44,209
Speaker 1: Kind of.

233
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:44,439
Speaker 1: Yeah.

234
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:44,861
Speaker 1: Yeah.

235
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:45,119
Speaker 0: Right.

236
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,210
Speaker 0: That's what I'm talking about.

237
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:46,544
Speaker 0: Right.

238
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,090
Speaker 0: So it's you know, the fact that it's and the thing is, yeah, it's giant.

239
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:51,909
Speaker 0: If you put it next to other iPads, it's big.

240
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,209
Speaker 0: But it's not that big.

241
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:59,110
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, at first it seemed really big, but it just keeps feeling smaller and smaller all the time.

242
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:00,250
Speaker 0: And now it's just like, whatever.

243
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:01,308
Speaker 0: But you know what?

244
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:09,408
Speaker 0: My my giant iPhone six, which isn't even the six plus, just a regular six feels really small to have the giant iPad.

245
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:12,070
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, tiny phone.

246
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:12,287
Speaker 0: Wow.

247
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,270
Speaker 0: You really phone.

248
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,210
Speaker 0: You're really tiny phone.

249
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,809
Speaker 0: How did I use you for months when you were so tiny?

250
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:25,710
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, so I held I got like I went to one of those like kind of dodgy phone stores in the city and I held the Sony Xperia phone in my hand, like the Z5 Compact.

251
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:27,287
Speaker 1: Fucker's tiny.

252
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,087
Speaker 0: OK.

253
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:29,088
Speaker 1: He's a little guy.

254
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:29,804
Speaker 0: All right.

255
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:33,250
Speaker 0: Other things about the giant iPad.

256
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:37,449
Speaker 0: The thing is, it's way, way fast.

257
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:41,450
Speaker 0: Obviously, you're not doing things with it like you'd be doing at a desktop computer.

258
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,770
Speaker 0: So you're not encoding MP4s and shit.

259
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,329
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe you can with the right app.

260
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:53,910
Speaker 0: But it's like there is absolutely been no situation where it lagged or delayed or skipped frames or like everything.

261
00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:00,388
Speaker 0: It's like it's just like the most more than any even desktop computer, like desktop computers, like a brand new windows on them.

262
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,130
Speaker 0: And there's been, you know, some things that are slow.

263
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:04,670
Speaker 0: You uninstall something.

264
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,307
Speaker 0: It takes a bit.

265
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,050
Speaker 0: There is the only thing that slows this thing down is when the Internet is slow.

266
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:14,530
Speaker 0: Other than that, it's like the speed of everything is just like lightning.

267
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,410
Speaker 0: There is no app that can tax even when you go to apps at once and split the screen.

268
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:24,370
Speaker 0: They just you cannot tax the power of this thing with iOS apps.

269
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:25,489
Speaker 0: It just cannot be done.

270
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:26,610
Speaker 0: It is so strong.

271
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,816
Speaker 0: And the screen is like.

272
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:37,608
Speaker 0: the reason I bought is because the screen the resolution is so high and it delivers on the insane resolution, like go find a 4K video on YouTube and full screen it.

273
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:38,870
Speaker 0: It plays it like whatever.

274
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:39,648
Speaker 0: I got that.

275
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:40,490
Speaker 0: No problem.

276
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:41,150
Speaker 0: All right.

277
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:45,890
Speaker 0: And the screen is just like this has more pixels than like that monitor times.

278
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:53,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what's really getting me that I see Scott holding that thing in his hand and I have a giant fucking like Dell UltraSharp in front of me that has a way fewer.

279
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,569
Speaker 0: Someone put a screenshot online.

280
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,610
Speaker 0: So look, see, see these icons.

281
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:02,770
Speaker 0: You can fit a screenshot from the iPhone four in between these icons.

282
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:06,790
Speaker 1: See, my windows shit can't do that.

283
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,489
Speaker 1: I mean, the resolution on my Lenovo is like eleven something, but like it's not a lot like 13 something.

284
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:14,147
Speaker 1: I don't even remember what it is.

285
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,069
Speaker 0: Plus, you know, you got the Safari ad blocking, you know, how many ad issues going on.

286
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,589
Speaker 0: I paid for YouTube, so I don't even have YouTube ads.

287
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:22,801
Speaker 0: And it's just like everything is.

288
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:23,609
Speaker 0: everything is good times.

289
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,829
Speaker 0: Now, the only thing is the keyboard.

290
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,930
Speaker 0: They remove the feature that let you split the software keyboard.

291
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,330
Speaker 0: They really want you to buy their hardware keyboard.

292
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,408
Speaker 0: I tried it.

293
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,469
Speaker 0: It's not that great.

294
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,670
Speaker 0: Also, imagine if I had that hardware keyboard right now, where the hell would I put it?

295
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:40,450
Speaker 1: Like, you know, that's where you're sitting in a Starbucks with it propped up on something.

296
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:46,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, you know, at first I was having trouble with the software keyboard because it's so big and your hands are so far apart.

297
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:48,129
Speaker 0: But I got used to it.

298
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,969
Speaker 0: It just took a little while and now I'm fine.

299
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,130
Speaker 0: I tried the pencil in the Apple store.

300
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:53,490
Speaker 0: That's some more rip off shit.

301
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:55,170
Speaker 0: One hundred bucks for a piece of plastic.

302
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:55,950
Speaker 0: Go fuck yourself.

303
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,830
Speaker 0: I'm not paying that for one hundred bucks, but I use the pencil in the Apple store.

304
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:00,768
Speaker 0: And you know what?

305
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,426
Speaker 1: We're nice.

306
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,030
Speaker 0: The pencil is totally legit.

307
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:04,470
Speaker 0: It is so legit.

308
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,088
Speaker 0: That pencil.

309
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:09,770
Speaker 0: If you are the kind of person who wants to draw on here, get that pencil.

310
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:16,810
Speaker 0: The only thing with the pencil that I can tell you not being an artist is that it's not really pressure sensitive.

311
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:22,648
Speaker 0: You can't push harder to get it to do more like you can with the Wacom, but you can lean it.

312
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:25,590
Speaker 0: So like I was drawing and then I leaned it.

313
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:27,589
Speaker 1: I was trying to brush in shade.

314
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, the brush got bigger as a leaned.

315
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:39,850
Speaker 0: So it's you had to get used to not pushing with a wake like you do with the Wacom, but leaning to get the adjustable brush size and shape.

316
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:41,250
Speaker 0: But it was so responsive.

317
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:44,710
Speaker 0: Like, you know, those things you use like in the grocery store to sign your name.

318
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,106
Speaker 0: Yeah.

319
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:48,350
Speaker 1: It's like I just fill all the pixels in because there's only like one hundred of them.

320
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:53,390
Speaker 0: Imagine like that technology, like basically perfected.

321
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,430
Speaker 0: Like you can't imagine it being better.

322
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,710
Speaker 0: It's like you put it on the screen and pixels immediately appear.

323
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:00,650
Speaker 0: You start drawing and it's like it's like you're writing with a pencil.

324
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,590
Speaker 0: But it's a hundred bucks.

325
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,126
Speaker 0: So fuck you.

326
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:02,958
Speaker 1: What did that?

327
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,689
Speaker 1: super well?

328
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:11,828
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for third party pencils for less than a hundred bucks during the like a couple rounds ago when people really pushing tablet PCs for productivity.

329
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:12,150
Speaker 1: nonsense.

330
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:22,390
Speaker 1: When we were at RIT and I worked for ITS or I see whatever I worked for the IT department of RIT, they gave me that huge Dell like tablet that was like an inch thick.

331
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:26,731
Speaker 0: And I remember those original tablet pieces from 2000.

332
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:28,010
Speaker 0: The pen worked real well on that, too.

333
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,630
Speaker 1: Like I just write and it was just totally great.

334
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,190
Speaker 1: It just it was fucking slow as shit.

335
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,969
Speaker 1: Windows PC with a spinning disk in it.

336
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,510
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I'll probably get an iPad.

337
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:37,870
Speaker 1: It's it's in the horizon.

338
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:44,104
Speaker 0: The iPad Air is basically like it's just smaller and you know than this, but still plenty big enough.

339
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:46,650
Speaker 1: See, I still can't pencil.

340
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,007
Speaker 1: I still need a laptop.

341
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:49,387
Speaker 0: I thought I did.

342
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,010
Speaker 0: I did before I had an iPad.

343
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,488
Speaker 1: So other than games.

344
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,350
Speaker 1: So one games.

345
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,063
Speaker 1: But that's a five.

346
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:54,965
Speaker 0: OK.

347
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:02,830
Speaker 1: The only audition plugging it, plugging this fucking mixer into a laptop to record shit.

348
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,650
Speaker 0: So there are plenty.

349
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,170
Speaker 1: Is there a firewire interface for the eye?

350
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,590
Speaker 0: You can plug in just regular microphone and record.

351
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:11,889
Speaker 1: That is not going to do.

352
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,710
Speaker 0: It doesn't have to be a mixer.

353
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:15,616
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that is a use case.

354
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:24,206
Speaker 1: I have like how often you take in your mixer with the last any time we do in the other room, what I'm going to build a computer and put it in the other room.

355
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,570
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, right.

356
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:30,350
Speaker 0: It's like if you're, you know, use your laptop for like watching a video in bed.

357
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:31,670
Speaker 1: I don't use my laptop for that.

358
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:32,127
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

359
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,250
Speaker 0: That's why I'm going to get an iPad.

360
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,370
Speaker 0: You don't you don't need the use cases in your bedroom.

361
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,589
Speaker 1: If you got this thing, let me tell you, my use cases are now tiny phone in my pocket all the time.

362
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,550
Speaker 1: Don't really look at it that much because I got a smartwatch.

363
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,410
Speaker 1: iPad watching videos in bed, doing stuff on an airplane.

364
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:58,010
Speaker 1: The only device I take with me to a friend's house or convention laptop doing actual work, recording video, editing video, playing zip file.

365
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:03,969
Speaker 0: I got Premiere Adobe clip on here, which is actually quite amazing as well as YouTube capture and YouTube studio.

366
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:07,560
Speaker 0: Also, they had this Adobe prelude live logger.

367
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:11,210
Speaker 0: that is prelude the live logger app, right?

368
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:21,450
Speaker 0: You turn it on while you're recording your video and you take your notes and then you load your video clips with time codes into into prelude and you load your live logger output into prelude.

369
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:27,830
Speaker 1: No, Scott, believe me, my my ideal workflow is I've got the laptop running audition, like doing the audio shit when we're recording.

370
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:30,950
Speaker 1: And separately, I've got the iPad in my hand using prelude.

371
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,557
Speaker 0: But you can use the.

372
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:35,029
Speaker 0: you can use live logger even without the giant iPad uses regular.

373
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to get the iPad air to.

374
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:38,184
Speaker 0: probably it's just.

375
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:41,310
Speaker 0: it's basically the same as this only smaller, only slightly smaller.

376
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:41,584
Speaker 0: Yeah.

377
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:42,910
Speaker 0: And less powerful.

378
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:44,310
Speaker 0: But oh, and no pencil.

379
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:45,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't need the pencil.

380
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:46,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I got to wake up.

381
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,709
Speaker 1: I plug into my laptop.

382
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:48,390
Speaker 0: Sure.

383
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,089
Speaker 1: Well, the iPad is a cool device.

384
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:50,826
Speaker 0: It's OK.

385
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,610
Speaker 0: I mean, I had iPad before and it almost replaced my entire laptop.

386
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,769
Speaker 0: This one pretty much did.

387
00:21:57,451 --> 00:22:01,708
Speaker 0: And even if I want to code something, someone made this get to go app, which has a text editor in it.

388
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:05,550
Speaker 0: So as long as your code is only GitHub, you know.

389
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,568
Speaker 1: So two more little news is kind of just I want to get these out here because they happen recently.

390
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,970
Speaker 1: There's a backlog of like interesting tech things that happen.

391
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:20,168
Speaker 1: Mozilla is removing support from Chrome or from Chrome from Firefox for, quote, complete themes.

392
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:23,688
Speaker 1: And I had to look at what the hell that was.

393
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:24,889
Speaker 0: All right.

394
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,470
Speaker 0: And it's stupid.

395
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,030
Speaker 0: What is this?

396
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,230
Speaker 1: So you want to customize like the way Firefox looks?

397
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,170
Speaker 0: I mean, I have I have my Chrome has like a Hasanimiku theme.

398
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,090
Speaker 0: We're like, it's not that it's really subtle.

399
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,526
Speaker 0: Like the bar is like, you know, cyan and, you know, Hasanimiku color instead of being gray.

400
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,830
Speaker 0: And when you make a new tab, the background is like a miku.

401
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,950
Speaker 0: So Mozilla looks the same as regular.

402
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,950
Speaker 1: Mozilla has two different ways of doing things.

403
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,670
Speaker 1: They have complete themes and persona themes.

404
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:56,030
Speaker 1: Persona themes are like change the background colors and frames and things.

405
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I have in Chrome.

406
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:05,490
Speaker 1: Heavyweight themes are colors of button sizes and borders and tab placement and basically you can take every user interface.

407
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,710
Speaker 1: It's the FVWM of fucking with Firefox.

408
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,909
Speaker 0: So you basically ruin your yes.

409
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,289
Speaker 0: You ruin your browser Firefox for yourself with this thing unless someone has a really fucking good theme.

410
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:24,889
Speaker 1: So Mozilla got rid of it as part of an initiative to have all the features in Firefox either be great or not existent.

411
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:26,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a great feature.

412
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,669
Speaker 0: It's like a feature that can be great.

413
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:38,146
Speaker 0: But it's like if someone manages to use something that feature to make a better UI for Firefox, that should just be the Firefox UI, the default UI, get rid of the existing UI.

414
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,289
Speaker 1: But Mozilla is doing so.

415
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,130
Speaker 1: The initiative, they call it literally the great or dead initiative.

416
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:44,230
Speaker 1: And it is great.

417
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,510
Speaker 0: It's not the great full dead.

418
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:52,790
Speaker 1: So the headline was that the Firefox community, quote, did not respond well to this piece of news, unquote.

419
00:23:53,272 --> 00:23:56,270
Speaker 1: And they saw it as, quote, chroma-fying Firefox.

420
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,290
Speaker 1: Now, one, yes, you should chroma-fying Firefox.

421
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:07,730
Speaker 1: Two, there's the idea of a community around a browser, like the use of a browser, not the development community.

422
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,670
Speaker 1: Like I'm adding features to an open source browser.

423
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:12,070
Speaker 0: But your passion is Firefox.

424
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:19,489
Speaker 1: If your passion is being a user of Firefox, you are being left behind by the rest of the world, dude.

425
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,409
Speaker 0: It's a sad life.

426
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:30,650
Speaker 1: And I am glad this feature is going away and the Firefox community can eat a bag of dicks because this is a very small but vocal minority.

427
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:30,950
Speaker 1: Yes.

428
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:51,066
Speaker 1: But the the general case here is that one, if you have an open source project, you probably have things you want to do that you're not doing because you have a vocal set of users passionate about your project in your project's community who aren't really contributing your code base, but have a lot of opinions about the very specific things you could do just for them.

429
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,630
Speaker 1: Probably should just ignore them and do the thing you think is right, because it's your project.

430
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,270
Speaker 1: It's open source.

431
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,610
Speaker 1: If they're that mad, they can fork it.

432
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:58,989
Speaker 1: And guess what?

433
00:24:59,070 --> 00:24:59,390
Speaker 1: They won't.

434
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:24,010
Speaker 1: And two, if you are heavily customizing the UIs of things like web browsers, like basic OS stuff, like if you're the kind of person who's trying to use FVWM to make your like ultra custom to you, like you've customized every possible thing in the GUI, that's a bad idea and you're going to really regret it a few years from now when you can't use normal computers anymore.

435
00:25:24,753 --> 00:25:25,949
Speaker 1: Like back away now.

436
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,430
Speaker 1: The road you're on goes nowhere.

437
00:25:29,553 --> 00:25:30,508
Speaker 1: And one last tiny news.

438
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,590
Speaker 1: Technology can solve problems because we want police to wear body cameras.

439
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,149
Speaker 1: That seems like an obvious thing, right?

440
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:45,910
Speaker 1: Well, the people who are fighting putting body cameras in place are also the people who are going with the lowest bidder to get body cameras.

441
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:52,730
Speaker 1: So body cameras straight up have 2008 era like Windows malware just in them.

442
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:54,390
Speaker 1: Good game.

443
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,910
Speaker 0: How does a camera get malware?

444
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:01,390
Speaker 1: So the camera takes a picture like every 30 seconds and records all this with timestamps and GPS coordinates.

445
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,210
Speaker 1: So it's just taking like constant data of what the cops doing when he's on duty.

446
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,050
Speaker 1: And then I guess if you hit a button like, oh shit, it's go time.

447
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:13,628
Speaker 1: It also records audio and video constantly for that period, like a black box to get the data off.

448
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:19,204
Speaker 1: When you get back, you plug it, you plug the camera with its USB cable into a computer and get the data off.

449
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:24,450
Speaker 1: Uh, the USB cable thing just has malware in it.

450
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:34,190
Speaker 1: It has conficker from like 2008 calling and yeah, because there's no quality control and the companies that make these things are pieces of shit who don't know what they're doing and it all goes to the lowest bidder.

451
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:59,765
Speaker 1: So even if technology can solve problems like police brutality, it really can't because the government is still the one actually doing this stuff and you're going to get a 2008 era like windows malware on the PC in the, in the secure network at the police station where the minimum wage guys like plugging all the things in to get the data off at the end of the day and then all the police footage is probably just going to be like on pirate bay somewhere.

452
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:03,309
Speaker 0: So yeah, I don't know how people fuck this up.

453
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:08,330
Speaker 1: I know how because no one who is involved in the project is being paid enough to care.

454
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:27,630
Speaker 1: The few people who do care are told the security features have to be cut for budget reasons and the people who are buying the products and municipalities don't actually want body cameras, so they're certainly not going to put money into making them better and things of the day.

455
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,350
Speaker 1: Continuing that depressing line of thought.

456
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,650
Speaker 1: This is a video that the US government put out in 1954.

457
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,930
Speaker 1: I seen this video, the house in the middle.

458
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:43,988
Speaker 1: The moral of this video is you need to be a good housewife and keep your house tidy or your family will die when the nukes go off.

459
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,590
Speaker 1: Like literally that is what this video is saying.

460
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:51,730
Speaker 1: It talks about how the flash from the nuclear weapon might set stuff in your house on fire.

461
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:57,886
Speaker 1: unless you keep like tidy tables and dust regularly and keep all the leaves out of your yard.

462
00:27:58,930 --> 00:27:59,247
Speaker 0: You know what?

463
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:04,107
Speaker 0: It's definitely going to set your house on fire from the nuclear fission and your house is made of wood.

464
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,670
Speaker 1: So well, no, because in the video is your house a lead castle?

465
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:11,544
Speaker 0: So you may have to worry about your house being so.

466
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,830
Speaker 1: you realize there is a concept of anti flash white.

467
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:29,069
Speaker 1: So like nuclear bombers and like even modern stuff, they paint things that deal with nuclear weapons whites because that actually increases, well, I guess decreases the range they can safely operate in during the flash from nuclear weapons.

468
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:31,050
Speaker 0: Okay.

469
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:32,329
Speaker 1: Like for real, it works.

470
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:34,010
Speaker 0: Sure, of course.

471
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:45,890
Speaker 1: But yeah, you know, but this video uses that concept to tell housewives to keep their houses tidy to prevent the house from burning at the very edge of a nuclear blast.

472
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,490
Speaker 1: So yeah.

473
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:49,469
Speaker 0: Okay.

474
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:58,929
Speaker 0: Uh, so, uh, I just looked through my youtube videos and there's something I found today because it came up randomly and I found a youtube video of it.

475
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:05,451
Speaker 0: This is a video of the New York Tokyo music festival of 2002.

476
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:08,409
Speaker 0: That's the one we were at, which is a thing that we were at.

477
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:10,129
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

478
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,550
Speaker 1: We, we were totally at this.

479
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,529
Speaker 1: We told the story.

480
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,189
Speaker 1: What the fuck happened to us after it?

481
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,409
Speaker 0: We were at this thing.

482
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,968
Speaker 0: So here's a video of the thing.

483
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:21,370
Speaker 0: A really bad video that someone made.

484
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,389
Speaker 1: Did you see us in the video?

485
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:24,089
Speaker 0: I don't, I didn't watch the whole thing.

486
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:31,130
Speaker 1: I'm gonna watch the video cause there was a point where I was at the front of this stage, like jumping up and down in that mall at the South street C part.

487
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:31,719
Speaker 0: Yup.

488
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,749
Speaker 0: I think that also shows other parts of the festival that we were not at, but this is the part we were at.

489
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,077
Speaker 0: Yup.

490
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:36,928
Speaker 1: I remember this.

491
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:39,330
Speaker 1: Remember she started crying on stage.

492
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:40,930
Speaker 1: Ooh, there's shots of the crowd.

493
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,289
Speaker 1: Did you spooky that we walked out during his set?

494
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:43,904
Speaker 1: I think.

495
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:45,810
Speaker 0: Yeah.

496
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,490
Speaker 0: There was another apparently part where like P lander Z, but that wasn't the thing we went to.

497
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,109
Speaker 0: That was another thing.

498
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:50,450
Speaker 1: Yeah.

499
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,150
Speaker 0: So yeah, this is just interesting from 2002.

500
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,170
Speaker 1: I'm the fifth person to like this video just now.

501
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:57,988
Speaker 0: I'm probably the fourth.

502
00:29:59,210 --> 00:29:59,273
Speaker 1: Wow.

503
00:30:00,753 --> 00:30:02,670
Speaker 1: That is a blast from the past.

504
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,588
Speaker 1: We were not even doing geek nights.

505
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:05,389
Speaker 0: No.

506
00:30:05,491 --> 00:30:07,610
Speaker 0: Like pre-geek nights.

507
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,610
Speaker 1: We were just doing weeaboo stuff in New York city.

508
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,170
Speaker 0: Yup.

509
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:11,949
Speaker 0: Wow.

510
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:12,390
Speaker 0: Yeah.

511
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,550
Speaker 0: That's the part we weren't at in the moment.

512
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,110
Speaker 1: The booklet book for a while is still been the wheel of time.

513
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:18,689
Speaker 1: Still talking about it often.

514
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:19,586
Speaker 0: Okay.

515
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:20,969
Speaker 1: We have a Patreon.

516
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,669
Speaker 1: Give us money and we'll continue to make stuff.

517
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:24,857
Speaker 1: Yeah.

518
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,410
Speaker 1: I'm not going to keep trying to do the hard sell.

519
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,770
Speaker 1: Listen to the show after the credits.

520
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:29,289
Speaker 1: And I do stuff just for you.

521
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,090
Speaker 1: The patrons, we let the patrons choose the last Thursday episode.

522
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:37,310
Speaker 1: And luckily there was some low hanging fruit in a food episode.

523
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:40,550
Speaker 1: But, uh, we might do that again at some point in the future.

524
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,730
Speaker 1: In fact, we will do that again at some point in the future.

525
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,290
Speaker 1: And otherwise we're going to be at Magfest.

526
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,989
Speaker 1: We're probably going to be at PAX South and PAX East.

527
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:50,568
Speaker 1: Uh, keep your eye out.

528
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,049
Speaker 1: Badges and hotels and things for PAX East are coming up in the nearing horizon.

529
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,430
Speaker 1: PAX East sells out immediately.

530
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,750
Speaker 1: So, uh, keep an eye out for people rumbling that you should have five.

531
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:07,347
Speaker 1: I don't think you need to have five yet, but as soon as I think you should have five, I'll start telling you to have five.

532
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:08,568
Speaker 0: Okay.

533
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:11,750
Speaker 1: If it's too much of a pain in the ass, go to PAX East.

534
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,570
Speaker 1: Honestly, go to PAX South.

535
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,970
Speaker 1: It's probably easier and cheaper to get to and you can totally just buy badges.

536
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,990
Speaker 1: So, and yeah, we kind of don't follow tech news out of personal interest anymore.

537
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:27,549
Speaker 0: Uh, oh, we're going with this show idea?

538
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,328
Speaker 1: You agreed to it.

539
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:30,225
Speaker 0: Did I?

540
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,370
Speaker 1: Do you have something better?

541
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,909
Speaker 1: I will happily do a different show.

542
00:31:34,132 --> 00:31:35,110
Speaker 0: I don't really know.

543
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,310
Speaker 1: Did you like my other idea?

544
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,489
Speaker 0: I forget your other idea.

545
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,610
Speaker 1: Anti-customization.

546
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:41,110
Speaker 1: I did the news about Mozilla.

547
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,148
Speaker 0: I feel like I've talked about that a zillion times already.

548
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,848
Speaker 1: We have, but we haven't done a show about it.

549
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:45,347
Speaker 0: Okay.

550
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:51,249
Speaker 1: So someone who's mad about it can link to their friend who's setting up FEWM on their Gentoo and be like, no, stop.

551
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:52,307
Speaker 1: Do not do.

552
00:31:53,670 --> 00:32:05,210
Speaker 1: So I do still follow tech news and so does Scott, but I think the thing is I am not excited about tech news the way I was like 1998, like in 1998.

553
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,089
Speaker 1: Like I read slash shot every fucking day.

554
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:10,610
Speaker 1: Like how 2002 I read slash shot every day.

555
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:16,670
Speaker 1: Like every article I would read, I was active on slash dot, like posting, responding to people.

556
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:18,950
Speaker 1: I would like read tech blogs.

557
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:20,850
Speaker 1: I listened to a bunch of tech podcasts.

558
00:32:21,452 --> 00:32:24,150
Speaker 1: Like I used to listen to this week in tech before I realized they don't know anything.

559
00:32:24,432 --> 00:32:26,310
Speaker 0: I also listened to that for quite a while.

560
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:31,169
Speaker 1: In fact, I listened to it, was entertained by it and learned things from it.

561
00:32:32,473 --> 00:32:33,650
Speaker 1: That is not true anymore.

562
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,590
Speaker 1: Does it even still exist?

563
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:35,748
Speaker 0: I think it does.

564
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:36,327
Speaker 0: I don't know.

565
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,429
Speaker 0: I don't know what happened to it.

566
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:39,550
Speaker 1: Do any of you listen to tech podcasts?

567
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,848
Speaker 1: Like I'm really curious.

568
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:42,126
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

569
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:43,709
Speaker 1: Cause you're listening to one, I guess.

570
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,670
Speaker 1: I mean, this is a tech podcast technically.

571
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:52,009
Speaker 1: And I feel like when we first started geek nights, you know, our idea was like, we want to be pan geeks.

572
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,030
Speaker 1: We're talking about all the geekeries.

573
00:32:53,452 --> 00:32:58,489
Speaker 1: We spent a long time trying to decide like what the four geekeries were going to be that we were going to cover.

574
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:05,910
Speaker 1: And the reason Mondays was tech is because it was just sort of assumed like, Oh, we're doing a nerdy podcast.

575
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,870
Speaker 1: I guess technology has to be one of the nights.

576
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:09,346
Speaker 1: So that was the first one we came up with.

577
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:11,590
Speaker 1: Cause that was like what we were into.

578
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:12,948
Speaker 1: Like we were on slash dot and stuff.

579
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:22,829
Speaker 1: And I feel like, like I still read slash dot, but I don't care that there's a new, like kernels of Linux are coming out.

580
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,750
Speaker 1: Like I don't care what distro is popular.

581
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:30,090
Speaker 1: I don't need to know about the current state of any distro.

582
00:33:31,652 --> 00:33:48,410
Speaker 1: Like as a technologist making money in technology, staying up on like that level of tech news, like I used to stay up on in the two thousands, not relevant to my life, not relevant to my job, not relevant to even like my basic like ecosystem knowledge of technology.

583
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:56,163
Speaker 1: And I wonder if that's just us because we're old or if there actually is like a trend away from that.

584
00:33:57,653 --> 00:34:01,270
Speaker 0: I feel like, you know, the technology space, right.

585
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:10,029
Speaker 0: There would be such, you know, at least it felt like there are huge developments that were happening, you know, and there were, it's like smartphones exist now.

586
00:34:11,512 --> 00:34:18,889
Speaker 1: Well, remember like when we were like, there was a time when Scott and I like Scott had a Pentium 4 and I had a Pentium 4.

587
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never had a Pentium 4.

588
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,369
Speaker 1: No, you had a, what'd you have?

589
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,103
Speaker 0: I had an AMD.

590
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,730
Speaker 1: And then eventually, what'd you have in that BX board was a Pentium 3.

591
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,670
Speaker 0: That was a Pentium 3.

592
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:33,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott had his Pentium 3 and I had a fucking like Pentium 200 megahertz, like nonsense monster.

593
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:40,909
Speaker 1: And I bought a K7 because holy shit, AMD has surged past Intel.

594
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,732
Speaker 1: The K6 was something only nerds use the K6 3.

595
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:48,770
Speaker 1: The K7 you could buy and make a normal computer with and it was fast.

596
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:55,870
Speaker 1: And I remember like, I would follow on a day-to-day basis, like, well, not day-to-day, but like week-to-week, like, which chip sets should I get?

597
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,226
Speaker 1: The AMD, you know, chips, there's the, there's the 8-bit boards.

598
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,790
Speaker 0: It wasn't just computer building, right?

599
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:10,370
Speaker 0: It's like, go get some old software from those days and like, you know, compare it to software you have now, there were like huge leaps.

600
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:16,850
Speaker 0: Like one year, like the first year of college, we wanted to watch some videos we downloaded from, you know, pirated places.

601
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:19,970
Speaker 0: They were real media files that were way low res.

602
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:27,604
Speaker 0: The next year, someone invented like MPEG-4 and people were actually computers powerful enough to encode MPEG-4s.

603
00:35:28,351 --> 00:35:42,248
Speaker 0: And we were downloading HD videos that were 720p or 1080p MPEG-4s that were a few hundred megs and our computers are almost powerful enough to decode them or were powerful enough to decode them and watch them.

604
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:45,030
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember it was a huge fucking difference.

605
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:56,210
Speaker 1: I remember pirating MP3 codecs to make MP3s on my own computer and being like so utterly dumbstruck that I had this capability.

606
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:07,029
Speaker 0: We went, you know, one year we had to download a Counter-Strike update by going to a website and reloading until we can get through and trying a bunch of different websites so we could download this file and then run it.

607
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,310
Speaker 0: The next year, we were getting automatic updates from Steam.

608
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:23,130
Speaker 1: I bought a zip drive in the year 2000 because I needed that to carry my projects between my home computer and the computers over on the academic side of campus for my classes.

609
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:31,350
Speaker 1: The next year, there was a Windows Samba share that was just on the internal RIT network and I could access everything on a shared folder.

610
00:36:31,812 --> 00:36:36,510
Speaker 1: The next year after that, USB sticks didn't cost $180.

611
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:51,870
Speaker 0: I mean, we were, I remember we went, there was like a charity, you know, fake gambling night and the prize was a PS2 which had just come out and was super rare and people were buying PS2s just because they were also DVD players and then DVD players were 10 bucks.

612
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:57,290
Speaker 1: Remember that bootleg like weird import and DVD player that I bought?

613
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,949
Speaker 0: I remember the really good DVD player that belonged to us.

614
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,430
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, that one.

615
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,469
Speaker 1: I'm surprised Scott Johnson gave that to us.

616
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,117
Speaker 0: I mean, what was that thing?

617
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:31,850
Speaker 1: I don't remember what brand it was, but like I remember doing research and there was, if you bought a particular off brand DVD player, opened it up and like flash some firmware on it, it became region free and you could buy it for like $120, which was like half the cost of a DVD player in the open market.

618
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,850
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, things were progressing.

619
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:44,570
Speaker 0: I mean, you could check like almost weekly, there would be like tabs in browsers were invented, like things like that were happening when I was following technology closely.

620
00:37:45,372 --> 00:37:47,410
Speaker 1: And it wasn't just, there's more to it than that.

621
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,330
Speaker 1: Things were happening, but those were invisible unless you paid attention.

622
00:37:52,471 --> 00:38:01,270
Speaker 1: Like if you were not a nerd, like following slashdot, you never heard of the Phoenix browser and it's like tabs and whatever that bullshit, which became Firebird and Firefox, right?

623
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,750
Speaker 0: I was using that when it was like Phoenix 0.6.

624
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:03,901
Speaker 1: Yeah.

625
00:38:04,091 --> 00:38:04,849
Speaker 1: Like I didn't use it.

626
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,388
Speaker 1: The crime didn't exist crash.

627
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:07,329
Speaker 0: It didn't crash.

628
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, it did crash on my computer.

629
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:09,929
Speaker 1: Right.

630
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,629
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like rim was like, oh, who needs tabs?

631
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,390
Speaker 1: I wanted tabs, but Firefox, Firefox, Phoenix fucking crashed.

632
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,726
Speaker 0: Didn't crash for me crash for me.

633
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,654
Speaker 1: Anyway, let's cause.

634
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,130
Speaker 1: you had that Pentium three with this rock solid board.

635
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:22,430
Speaker 0: I was running by that time.

636
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,649
Speaker 0: The Pentium three days were over.

637
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:28,590
Speaker 1: I was rocking a dodgy overclocked AMD case seven.

638
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,368
Speaker 0: These are the Athlon days by then.

639
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:34,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was backward, but think, but, but I think that's the, the difference between today.

640
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:37,950
Speaker 1: Back then there were two worlds of computing.

641
00:38:38,512 --> 00:38:44,929
Speaker 1: If you were a nerd and paid attention, there was magic that normal people literally could not access.

642
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:45,969
Speaker 1: Like ad block.

643
00:38:46,552 --> 00:38:47,929
Speaker 1: I had ad block in high school.

644
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,248
Speaker 1: Normal people discovered ad block this year.

645
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,149
Speaker 1: Like think about that.

646
00:38:53,250 --> 00:39:00,130
Speaker 1: This year, normal people like learned about the possibility of blocking ads and it was amazing.

647
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:08,109
Speaker 1: We knew about that shit in high school because we follow tech news and there was like a rapid progression of features like that.

648
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:13,310
Speaker 1: MP3 is only existed for nerds for a long time before normal people found out about Napster.

649
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:21,249
Speaker 1: But nowadays, any modern advanced like that is on everyone's computer immediately, whether you're paying attention or not.

650
00:39:21,451 --> 00:39:30,390
Speaker 0: And these, there isn't really things happening that make a drastic difference to the life of an everyday computer person or even a nerdy computer person.

651
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:36,838
Speaker 0: Maybe ad block that are, I mean, things that are brand new, things that aren't, there's nothing really happening.

652
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:38,090
Speaker 0: that's that significant.

653
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:42,350
Speaker 0: It wasn't like there is a thing called a smartphone now, right?

654
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:42,847
Speaker 0: That's that.

655
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,170
Speaker 0: Maybe I remember when that happened.

656
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,630
Speaker 0: It's like, Hey, the Palm trio is a thing and I was trying to get one.

657
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:48,288
Speaker 0: It wasn't easy.

658
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:48,583
Speaker 0: Yeah.

659
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:52,850
Speaker 1: Like I remember our friend Steve at RIT, like he was an early adopter of all that stuff.

660
00:39:53,570 --> 00:40:00,150
Speaker 1: And one day we were driving to a Linux convention through Canada and he was like, Yo, let me do my T-Mobile, whatever.

661
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,730
Speaker 1: And he shared a wireless hotspot with us in the van.

662
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,186
Speaker 1: Right.

663
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,029
Speaker 1: That was witchcraft back then.

664
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:10,090
Speaker 0: But no, because we were paying so much attention then we saw all these things.

665
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:19,167
Speaker 0: And, but now, even though if you pay attention, it's like, so all the things, when those things that we saw in advance became the hot new thing, they weren't the hot new thing to us.

666
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:23,970
Speaker 0: And now, even if you do pay attention, well, there must be a hot new thing that's going to not be hot new later.

667
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:25,250
Speaker 0: It's like, no, there really isn't.

668
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,128
Speaker 0: There's not really much going on right now.

669
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:27,890
Speaker 1: No, I think.

670
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:40,110
Speaker 1: So part of it, yeah, is that, that there are things that are happening, but they're pretty like things are just accessible to normal computer users pretty quick after they're invented or implemented.

671
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:46,630
Speaker 0: I mean, what's, what's, you know, what now is hot new for anybody anywhere?

672
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:51,806
Speaker 1: So multitasking for people with the iPod pro, like you should see people going crazy about this.

673
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:52,609
Speaker 0: Are they really?

674
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,570
Speaker 1: Like the idea of side-by-side apps is blowing the minds of people who don't know.

675
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,648
Speaker 0: Whose mind is blown by this?

676
00:40:59,072 --> 00:41:00,110
Speaker 1: I found some blogs.

677
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:00,534
Speaker 1: Okay.

678
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,278
Speaker 1: Yeah.

679
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:11,730
Speaker 1: But the other aspect of this, I think, is that back then, when we were paying attention, Linux on the desktop actually kind of mattered.

680
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,529
Speaker 1: Like I was trying to use Linux as my desktop for a long time.

681
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,710
Speaker 1: So like a Linux kernel update, unlocked features for me.

682
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,730
Speaker 1: Like, Hey, you can use a USB DVD player.

683
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:37,169
Speaker 1: Now that literally could not be done last week if it existed, but like things would appear like hardware that did not work in Linux would work in Linux because kernel updates and modules and things happened.

684
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,670
Speaker 1: Nowadays, one Linux on the desktop is dead.

685
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,950
Speaker 0: Well, it's dead, but actually it works kind of well if you use it.

686
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,630
Speaker 1: It does work kind of well, but it's useless and dead.

687
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,649
Speaker 1: So it does not affect my life.

688
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:58,790
Speaker 1: If anything changes in Linux, like in the old days, like at RIT, I knew at any given month, what distro, if a random person said, Hey, what Linux distro should I run on my desktop?

689
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:01,430
Speaker 1: I would say Ubuntu or Gentoo or whatever.

690
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:03,350
Speaker 1: And I knew the answer nowadays.

691
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:12,210
Speaker 1: I don't need to know the answer because if someone asked me that I can Google and the answer might be different, but knowing the answer didn't matter up until that point.

692
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,950
Speaker 1: Like it probably isn't Ubuntu because Linux is dead on the desktop.

693
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,630
Speaker 1: It's probably just run Red Hat or CentOS.

694
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,330
Speaker 1: Who cares?

695
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,307
Speaker 1: Maybe Arch.

696
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:20,225
Speaker 1: I don't know.

697
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,888
Speaker 1: Don't run Gentoo, I guess.

698
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:25,630
Speaker 0: But yeah, there is what is happening.

699
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,373
Speaker 0: I'm like, I'm trying to do.

700
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:29,230
Speaker 0: it's like, okay, this 4k stuff happening, right?

701
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:32,550
Speaker 0: But it's like, it's not really happening too much.

702
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,269
Speaker 1: Well, it's hardware too.

703
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,770
Speaker 1: Like I knew about the capability, like the, what you could do with high resolution monitors.

704
00:42:39,571 --> 00:42:47,370
Speaker 1: I saw ideas for that in the nineties, and now I still can't buy a high resolution monitor and use it with windows effectively.

705
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:50,330
Speaker 1: Like even now I've can see a zebra storyteller.

706
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:58,670
Speaker 1: The idea, even if I know about some fancy new monitor until it comes out on the real normal human market, my foreknowledge buys me nothing.

707
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:04,868
Speaker 0: And even if, you know, like windows still doesn't support the super high resolution screens, only OS X does.

708
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,610
Speaker 0: So you don't really have much choice.

709
00:43:07,111 --> 00:43:10,430
Speaker 1: So I guess I'm getting to this point where what other, what are the developments?

710
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,070
Speaker 0: Are there VR?

711
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,009
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, that's not really going to happen.

712
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,590
Speaker 0: That's like paying attention to like flexible, you know, ink displays.

713
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,850
Speaker 0: Like they never really happened.

714
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,869
Speaker 1: Paying attention to that early only helps you if you're developing on it.

715
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,321
Speaker 0: Sure.

716
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,610
Speaker 0: And I don't think there's going to be customers.

717
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,789
Speaker 0: I think it's, you know, it's definitely coming now.

718
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,610
Speaker 0: It's just going to be a repeat of the nineties where like, okay, they'll put in some arcade somewhere.

719
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,027
Speaker 0: No, one's going to buy these things for home.

720
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:34,895
Speaker 0: No crazy nerds.

721
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,270
Speaker 1: You know, the next generation is going to be pretty mainstream.

722
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:40,309
Speaker 1: I'm pretty confident in that.

723
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,330
Speaker 0: As long as it's a thing you have to wear on your face, I don't see it happening.

724
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,390
Speaker 1: I see it happening with the thing you have to wear on your face.

725
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:53,729
Speaker 1: One generation from now, the generation now is going to be for nerds, hobbyists, enthusiasts, and people who are paying attention and care about that thing.

726
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:57,070
Speaker 1: The next generation, the Oculus two is too optimistic.

727
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,190
Speaker 1: I think that's too pessimistic.

728
00:43:59,570 --> 00:43:59,959
Speaker 0: All right.

729
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:01,528
Speaker 1: Here's our next show.

730
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,929
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that.

731
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,327
Speaker 1: We did.

732
00:44:03,612 --> 00:44:04,449
Speaker 0: That's all I had to say.

733
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,924
Speaker 1: I got a lot more to say than that, but.

734
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:23,243
Speaker 1: But my point is just that if you have foreknowledge, like if you pay attention and read like all the tech news every day now, it really does not buy you much as a technologist compared to how much it bought you 15 years ago.

735
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:31,230
Speaker 1: Knowing about the current of like the current state of the art of web browsers got you magic features when we were in college.

736
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,530
Speaker 1: Now what?

737
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,885
Speaker 1: You're going to run the like the beta builds of Chrome, whatever.

738
00:44:35,945 --> 00:44:38,110
Speaker 1: that literally nothing's going to change in your life.

739
00:44:38,394 --> 00:44:39,010
Speaker 1: If you do that.

740
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:45,433
Speaker 1: When does it stop like that?

741
00:44:46,823 --> 00:44:47,839
Speaker 1: Like the end full stop.

742
00:44:49,464 --> 00:44:50,558
Speaker 1: We've actually done a full show.

743
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,259
Speaker 0: All right.

744
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,440
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

745
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,319
Speaker 0: There's like not a lot to say.

746
00:44:53,826 --> 00:44:54,920
Speaker 0: There's a point I have to make.

747
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,335
Speaker 0: I made it.

748
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:55,935
Speaker 0: The end.

749
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:04,410
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

750
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:09,549
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

751
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:14,950
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

752
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,870
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

753
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:22,630
Speaker 1: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

755
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:30,450
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

756
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:33,570
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

757
00:46:29,642 --> 00:46:37,337
Speaker 1: I have a feeling I pronounce some of those names slightly differently every time.

758
00:46:37,418 --> 00:46:45,299
Speaker 1: I do this because I just go straight down the list in Patreon and it's actually really hard to read a whole bunch of names in a row.

759
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:51,158
Speaker 1: So if I'm wrong about any of your names, you're welcome to send me the correct pronunciation or remind me.

760
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,577
Speaker 1: And now it's almost like the Daily Show moment of Zen, except it's the exact opposite of that.

761
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:58,879
Speaker 1: I present to you something super dumb.

762
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:01,180
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

763
00:47:02,245 --> 00:47:03,236
Speaker 1: Ah, here we are.

764
00:47:04,426 --> 00:47:05,071
Speaker 1: How's this?

765
00:47:42,412 --> 00:47:46,070
Speaker 1: Okay, I think I preferred the hot dog bed.
