1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,100
Speaker 2: It's Tuesday, June 27th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,980
Speaker 2: Tonight, we give a session report on our weekend of board gaming.

3
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:19,053
Speaker 2: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,180
Speaker 0: It's Monkey Tuesday!

5
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:23,010
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo doo doo.

6
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:24,515
Speaker 2: Doo doo doo doo doo.

7
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:39,839
Speaker 0: Alright, Juan, if any of you don't listen to Penn Jillette's podcast, or radio show, whatever, on free FM, free FM, lightning lightning, here you can be free, whatever, yeah, well one, check it out.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,339
Speaker 0: Two, check it out on Tuesdays if you do nothing else.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,959
Speaker 1: They should have a separate Tuesday only feed for that show.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,420
Speaker 0: Monkey Tuesday!

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,288
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo doo doo.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,740
Speaker 0: Well anyway, he has Monkey Tuesday, which is, it's just monkeys.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,899
Speaker 0: They'll talk about monkeys every Tuesday.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:07,800
Speaker 1: Listeners will all call in or mail in stories about monkeys that are humorous, usually involving smoking monkeys, monkey hiring a prostitute, that sort of thing.

15
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:11,660
Speaker 1: All kinds of craziness, and it's high-larious.

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:21,620
Speaker 0: Now for the 4th of July, because he went on about how Monkey Tuesday falls on the 4th of July this year, he is looking for patriotic monkey stories.

17
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:22,698
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:36,799
Speaker 0: Now Scott and I, this was Scott's idea, and I think it's a wonderful idea, we are going to try to make up the most hilarious and awesome, patriotically themed monkey story in the world, record it, send it to Penn, and see if he'll play it on the air.

19
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:43,799
Speaker 1: Yup, or read it on the air if it's an email, or maybe he'll call us when he's on the air because we won't be in the car or anything.

20
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I'll be at work or something.

21
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:47,733
Speaker 1: Yeah.

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,917
Speaker 1: No, but, yeah, he actually said, you know, if you don't have any stories, make them up and send them in.

24
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:56,479
Speaker 1: He won't check to see if it's the real deal.

25
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,620
Speaker 0: Our story's gonna have freaking monkeys.

26
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:06,660
Speaker 1: I was thinking it'd be an open air circus, monkeys, fireworks, yeah you get the idea.

27
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:10,960
Speaker 0: We're talking about monkeys liberating their fellow monkey friends with fireworks.

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,840
Speaker 1: On the 4th of July, at a circus.

29
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:14,420
Speaker 0: Alright.

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,479
Speaker 2: Monkey Tuesday.

31
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:31,660
Speaker 0: Anyway, in the actual non-monkey related news, the Supreme Court in 1989 ruled that flag burning is constitutionally protected free speech.

32
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,819
Speaker 1: Yup, I mean, it's just a cloth with a design on it.

33
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:39,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, and burning it, I mean, as long as you don't burn someone else's flag.

34
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:45,679
Speaker 1: Or as long as you don't set anything else on fire, or harm anyone with the fire, you're allowed to make fires.

35
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,840
Speaker 0: Well, a lot of places you aren't, but that's a whole different-

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:03:04,542
Speaker 1: As long as you don't, if you make a fire somewhere, you're not allowed to make a fire because it's dangerous, you know, but you can start a fire in your backyard, or on a campground, or in the street, as long as it's, you know, not like a fire, like a campfire in the middle Or what,

37
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:07,580
Speaker 0: I could burn a tiny little flag, and then it's no more dangerous than a cigarette.

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,276
Speaker 1: There you go.

39
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,298
Speaker 1: You're allowed to do that.

40
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:22,500
Speaker 0: Well, for anyone who isn't aware of this, very periodically, the Congress of the United States will rally around, particularly around election times, and try to pass a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.

41
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,360
Speaker 0: This has been coming up every single election year in some form for a long time.

42
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:29,640
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

43
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:40,499
Speaker 0: The difference is that just today, the Senate voted on whether or not they should put forth the measure that would actually put the flag burning amendment to a ratification bid.

44
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,060
Speaker 1: Now, if you don't know, flag burning is still okay, which means this still, this has never passed.

45
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,580
Speaker 1: They tried a zillion times, and it's never passed.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,796
Speaker 0: This time, the vote was 66 in favor of the amendment, 34 against.

47
00:03:54,301 --> 00:04:01,958
Speaker 1: So only one, you're one guy away, one senator away from possibly not being allowed to burn flags.

48
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:10,160
Speaker 0: Now, even scarier than this, it turns out that about 56% of Americans fully support this amendment and want flag burning to be banned.

49
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:14,485
Speaker 1: If anyone comes up to me and says they want flag burning to be banned, I'll say, "You hate

50
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:14,772
Speaker 1: freedom.".

51
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:24,480
Speaker 0: Now, the interesting thing is that there were three Republicans who voted against this, and one of them was the Republican whip, Mitch McConnell.

52
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,380
Speaker 0: Mitch, one-gallon-challenge McConnell.

53
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,620
Speaker 1: That's an inside joke about another guy named Mitch.

54
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, we know this guy Mitch, who is not a senator.

55
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,680
Speaker 1: No, but he did do the one-gallon challenge.

56
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,339
Speaker 0: Well, he attempted the one-gallon challenge.

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,499
Speaker 1: Yes, anyway, that's why it's a challenge.

58
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,540
Speaker 0: I wonder if Mitch McConnell's ever attempted the one-gallon challenge.

59
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,837
Speaker 0: Might have to get him on the show and ask him.

60
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,395
Speaker 1: Yep.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,498
Speaker 0: God, if we got Mitch McConnell on the show.

62
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:48,417
Speaker 1: That'd be crazy.

63
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,340
Speaker 0: We'd just ask him that one question.

64
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:58,331
Speaker 1: Well, we'd also be like, "Hey, so, uh, congratulations for having some nuts, unlike your other friends there in the

65
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:58,594
Speaker 1: Senate.".

66
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:11,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, he's the whip of the Republicans, and he voted against this, but other than that, it was pretty much a straight party-line vote, and the fact that it was only one vote away from going to a ratification bit kind of scares me.

67
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:15,400
Speaker 1: It's kind of frightening, and it's kind of weird that, you know, what is it?

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,600
Speaker 1: Democrats voting for freedom?

69
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,300
Speaker 1: That's kind of frightening.

70
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:31,020
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the Republicans- They're usually, like, if you look at what should be the official Democratic party line, the Republicans are actually supposed to be more freedom than the Democrats.

71
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,462
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, isn't?

72
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:46,980
Speaker 0: it used to be that the conservatives and the Republicans will cut taxes and save money and be frugal, and the Democrats are tax-and-spend liberals, but it's gotten now to where the Democrats are the fiscally conservative ones, and the Republicans are tax-and-spend.

73
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,999
Speaker 0: Well, no, no, no, they're tax-cut-and-spend.

74
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:51,578
Speaker 1: The other guys are tax-and-spend.

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,939
Speaker 1: Spending is across- we need a no-spend party to get voted in.

76
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,800
Speaker 0: The problem is, we can't cut spending on most things without creating holy hellfire.

77
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:08,281
Speaker 1: Oh, you're just gonna have to deal with some holy hellfire now, or, in the future, you won't-.

78
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:12,440
Speaker 1: you know, if we have a little bit of holy hellfire now, we can survive later.

79
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:12,876
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

80
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,610
Speaker 1: If we don't have holy hellfire now, later we're doomed and there's no way we can fix it.

81
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:25,400
Speaker 1: It's either suffer now to fix it forever, or for a long time, or we're gonna get to a point where it can't be fixed and it's all over.

82
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,040
Speaker 0: I guess it just frightens me that the government in general has been more and more attacking the First Amendment from every possible front.

83
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,900
Speaker 0: I mean, the FCC's powers have been expanded recently.

84
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:40,760
Speaker 0: They've greatly increased the fines for, you know, speaking obscenities on the radio, fuck.

85
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:41,698
Speaker 1: Fuck.

86
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:42,759
Speaker 1: Fuck them.

87
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:52,420
Speaker 0: And, now, this bill almost passed that would further- I mean, it would pass an amendment to restrict the First Amendment.

88
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:10,200
Speaker 1: You know, it's really so dumb, it's like, I can't tell if the people who are voting for this amendment, maybe some of them really are for flag burning and for freedom, and they just know that if the amendment passes, that there will be a glut of extra flag burning.

89
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Speaker 1: 'Cause right now, there isn't a problem with flag burning.

90
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,100
Speaker 0: I gotta say, if that amendment passed, I would be out on the street burning flags.

91
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,699
Speaker 1: You know what, I would start a company to sell flags made out of extremely flammable materials.

92
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,920
Speaker 0: No, you gotta make 'em out of a special wick so they burn for a long time.

93
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,739
Speaker 1: Well, they would be, but they would be easy to light on fire, they would burn safely- To sell flags.

94
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,940
Speaker 1: They would burn safely, slowly, and brightly.

95
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,619
Speaker 1: Special burning flags.

96
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,419
Speaker 0: Just make flags that have wicks on 'em.

97
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:36,931
Speaker 1: Yeah.

98
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,960
Speaker 1: Well, no, they'd also be all, like, waxed up, and they'd have some pyro in them to get, like, red, white, and blue fire.

99
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:44,739
Speaker 1: It'd be so great.

100
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:48,520
Speaker 0: I think that would be patriotic, having a red, white, and blue fireball.

101
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:49,269
Speaker 1: Yeah.

102
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:51,217
Speaker 0: Yeah.

103
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:51,629
Speaker 1: Yeah.

104
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:58,259
Speaker 0: Now, I could talk more about this, but it's just a news bit, and not a- What if a firework I buy has a little tiny flag on it?

105
00:07:58,664 --> 00:07:59,880
Speaker 1: Like, on the cardboard?

106
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:01,458
Speaker 0: You know what?

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,500
Speaker 0: It depends on the specific wording of the amendment, and the laws that would thereby be passed.

108
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:15,800
Speaker 0: Though I'll note, I'll note that if this were passed, there has only been, in the history of this country, one other amendment ever that restricted freedom.

109
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,140
Speaker 1: Every amendment- Prohibition.

110
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,858
Speaker 0: Every amendment we've ever had has either increased freedom, or had nothing to do with freedom.

111
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:22,439
Speaker 1: Yup.

112
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,280
Speaker 0: And the only amendment that ever restricted freedom was the Prohibition.

113
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,440
Speaker 1: And when Prohibition said, "You can't drink alcohol," and you know what?

114
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,400
Speaker 1: There was more alcohol drinking during Prohibition than ever.

115
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:36,360
Speaker 0: And the fact that it was repealed.

116
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:36,751
Speaker 1: Yeah.

117
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:46,738
Speaker 1: So, if there was a flag burning amendment, I bet you there would be more flag burning than has ever happened in the history of the world within a week, and then they would have to repeal it.

118
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:49,720
Speaker 1: Or, they would be putting so many people in jail.

119
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:55,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, we really, we should start a company now that makes special burning flags.

120
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

121
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,019
Speaker 0: Though, if something like that ever actually passed, I don't know what I'd do, other than burn flags.

122
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:02,859
Speaker 1: I'd burn a lot of flags.

123
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what else?

124
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:08,660
Speaker 0: What deeper inner meaning could we impart into that flag burning?

125
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:11,639
Speaker 1: I would burn lots and lots of flags.

126
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,396
Speaker 1: Big ones.

127
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,360
Speaker 1: All right, so I'd burn- In crazy places, in crazy creative ways.

128
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:17,534
Speaker 1: I'd burn a thousand flags.

129
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:25,399
Speaker 1: I would make little paper airplanes out of flags and throw them through fire hoops and all kinds of crazy stuff.

130
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,059
Speaker 0: So what would you call this act of yours?

131
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:29,980
Speaker 1: The aristocrats.

132
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:33,759
Speaker 0: See, without any prompting, I'm just glad you said that.

133
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,055
Speaker 0: Yep.

134
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:34,535
Speaker 0: Okay.

135
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,000
Speaker 0: Anyway, I have nothing else to say about this unless I did a whole episode on it.

136
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:45,779
Speaker 0: I'm not going to get into a political rant, but goddamn, one vote, just now, Senate, first amendment, bye bye.

137
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,879
Speaker 1: Thank you, One Gallon Challenge Mitch.

138
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,840
Speaker 0: Yes, you're my man, Mitch One Gallon McConnell.

139
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,660
Speaker 1: Yes, you saved me a lot of money on flags and matches.

140
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:02,480
Speaker 1: Okay, meanwhile, the Supreme Court and the other one third of our government- Yeah, I don't think we need to talk about the administrative branch.

141
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:03,119
Speaker 1: No, we don't.

142
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,540
Speaker 1: You mean the executive branch.

143
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, they're also administrative to a degree.

144
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:18,217
Speaker 1: So they are going to do some judgment, as judges do, on this case of KSR International Incorporated versus Teleflex.

145
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:19,279
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

146
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:19,798
Speaker 0: Yes.

147
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,612
Speaker 1: Really?

148
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:30,050
Speaker 1: Teleflex, apparently, has a patent covering, quote, "gas pedal," quote, "technology for cars and light

149
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,414
Speaker 1: trucks.".

150
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:34,999
Speaker 0: Um, uh, what could this possibly be?

151
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:38,900
Speaker 1: I think they've really just patented the gas pedal.

152
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:56,479
Speaker 0: You know, I gotta say, it doesn't surprise me, because I mentioned this before, but when I worked at IBM, I did, you know, crap for them all the time, and after I left, they emailed me, and they needed my information, my contact info, because they were trying to patent one of the things I had done for them.

153
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:05,180
Speaker 0: Something that was trivial and just like part of my normal duties, like, I wouldn't even consider signing my name on what I had done.

154
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,379
Speaker 0: It was like a bash script.

155
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,248
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

156
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,700
Speaker 0: But no, they want a patent on it, and it'll probably pass.

157
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:22,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so, KSR, the good company, has argued that the Federal Circuit, which is all the federal courts, have been improperly interpreting patent law for years when it comes to deciding whether an invention is obvious.

158
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:24,760
Speaker 1: I agree.

159
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:25,700
Speaker 1: Do you agree?

160
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I wonder what the Supreme Court's gonna rule.

161
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:43,920
Speaker 1: Well, the court has ruled in the past, for instance, that even a combination of preexisting, off-the-shelf components, in which each component performs exactly the same function that it had been known and was designed to perform, could be patentable.

162
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,100
Speaker 1: Such an interpretation, KSR argued--I'm reading the article.

163
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:49,600
Speaker 0: Oh, obviously.

164
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:58,040
Speaker 1: Such an interpretation, KSR argued, isn't consistent with the provision of federal patent law that dates to 1952, which I actually kind of like.

165
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,010
Speaker 1: It says, "A person having ordinary--".

166
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:09,838
Speaker 1: uh, okay, "An invention is not eligible for a patent if a person having an ordinary skill in the art would consider it

167
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:10,400
Speaker 1: obvious.".

168
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:11,819
Speaker 1: I think that's pretty good.

169
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is that people in the patent office aren't skilled in any art that would be patented.

170
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,940
Speaker 1: Exactly, but all they have to do is call up one guy who is a person having ordinary skill in the art and ask him if that's obvious or not.

171
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:25,053
Speaker 0: They could call me.

172
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,939
Speaker 1: They could call me.

173
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,278
Speaker 1: I mean, the thing is-- If it's a car thing, call Joe the Mechanic, you know?

174
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, though what do you do if it's an art where everyone is very intelligent?

175
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:42,120
Speaker 1: If you call Joe the Mechanic and say, "Hey, Joe the Mechanic, uh, look at this design for a gas pedal.

176
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:43,411
Speaker 2: Is that--is that

177
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:43,875
Speaker 2: obvious?".

178
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:45,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty obvious.

179
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,119
Speaker 1: Okay, no patent.

180
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,380
Speaker 1: Takes five seconds.

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
Speaker 1: Five seconds to call Joe the Mechanic.

182
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:56,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, but first they gotta vet out Joe the Mechanic's credentials, make sure he's a real mechanic, get the opinions of five other mechanics, then do the whole thing again?

183
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:57,780
Speaker 0: because No, you don't!

184
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,440
Speaker 1: If you could just walk to a mechanic shop and show him the thing, that's all you need!

185
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,539
Speaker 0: You realize the government can't do anything unless they can fully document the process from start to finish.

186
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,671
Speaker 1: I went to Joe the Mechanic on Fourth and Main--.

187
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:14,880
Speaker 0: No, no, as in, what is the specific procedure for finding a specific mechanic for each patent?

188
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:19,480
Speaker 1: This is the problem we have, is there's too much just useless paperwork in the way.

189
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,240
Speaker 0: That's not even paperwork, it's just you gotta have some sort of procedure.

190
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, the procedure is, you call someone who is having ordinary skill in the art.

191
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,079
Speaker 0: Who do you call?

192
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,260
Speaker 1: Anyone in the Yellow Pages.

193
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,020
Speaker 0: Um, what do you mean "anyone in the Yellow Pages"?

194
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,700
Speaker 0: There's a lot of non-mechanics in the Yellow Pages.

195
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,400
Speaker 1: Anyone who has ordinary skill in the art.

196
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,880
Speaker 0: How do you determine who has ordinary skill in the art?

197
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:44,080
Speaker 1: If it's a mechanic, you look under the mechanics section in the Yellow Pages.

198
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,338
Speaker 0: What if it's a mechanic who happens to specialize in jaguars, and he doesn't know anything about any of their cars?

199
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:52,877
Speaker 1: Then you call-- if he knows about any car, he knows about gas pedals.

200
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,000
Speaker 1: What if he just lies?

201
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,424
Speaker 0: What if you call a mechanic and just some punk kid who works there answers, he says, "Yeah, I'm Joe,".

202
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,076
Speaker 0: and then he just says, "Yeah, that's obvious,

203
00:14:00,117 --> 00:14:00,439
Speaker 0: whatever.".

204
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:02,160
Speaker 1: Alright.

205
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:03,399
Speaker 0: Fun.

206
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,180
Speaker 0: No it's not.

207
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:04,759
Speaker 0: Yes it is.

208
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:05,720
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter!

209
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,960
Speaker 1: I'm not even Joe the Mechanic, and the gas pedal is obvious.

210
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,220
Speaker 1: It's obvious.

211
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:10,951
Speaker 1: Yeah.

212
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,700
Speaker 1: Oh my god, who the hell is working in the patent office?

213
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:14,358
Speaker 1: Retards?

214
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,279
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

215
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:16,440
Speaker 1: It's a gas pedal.

216
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:17,520
Speaker 1: It's obvious.

217
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:18,880
Speaker 1: Every car has one.

218
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:19,856
Speaker 1: You can't patent it.

219
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,019
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

220
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,400
Speaker 0: Scott, have you ever read a patent?

221
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,439
Speaker 1: It's not-- I've seen a few.

222
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:39,659
Speaker 0: It's not obvious when something is obvious, because if you actually read a patent, the way patents have to be written, and many of them are written this way specifically to prevent the USPTO from investigating them, patents are written in a way that is almost indecipherable to normal humans.

223
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:43,720
Speaker 1: I say if a patent is indecipherable to normal humans, it's immediately void.

224
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,360
Speaker 0: No, because they won't accept patents that aren't written that way.

225
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:46,958
Speaker 1: They shouldn't.

226
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:48,900
Speaker 1: There should be a new way of submitting patents.

227
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,390
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

228
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:49,699
Speaker 0: a new way?

229
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,214
Speaker 1: You write one paragraph that describes in plain English what your invention is, the end.

230
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,959
Speaker 0: That doesn't work at all.

231
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,740
Speaker 0: We're going to dive one picture.

232
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,780
Speaker 0: Because what a patent is is you have to describe in excruciating detail what something does.

233
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,418
Speaker 1: You know what?

234
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,719
Speaker 1: If your thing is only different from other things in a very small, very, very tiny way, then it's not different enough, fuck you.

235
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:12,720
Speaker 0: I submit that with many very intricate manufacturing processes, in fact, it is very different.

236
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,535
Speaker 1: You shouldn't be able to patent stuff like that.

237
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:15,658
Speaker 0: Why not?

238
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:19,819
Speaker 1: I think you should only be able to patent physical inventions, that's it.

239
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,458
Speaker 0: They are physical inventions.

240
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,320
Speaker 1: What kind of physical invention is it, a machine?

241
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:31,019
Speaker 0: A physical invention of a type of machine that can create a certain kind of glass-ceramic hybrid chip.

242
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,000
Speaker 1: Good, here are the plans for my machine, there it is, the end.

243
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,180
Speaker 0: Okay, what if I make a machine that's better, or does something in a new, innovative way?

244
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,020
Speaker 1: The patent office gets the plans for the new machine, compares them to existing machine plans.

245
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:45,840
Speaker 0: They have no idea how this stuff works.

246
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,996
Speaker 1: You look at the plans for the machine, you look at all the other plans for machines, you say, "Oh, it's not the same as all these other machines,".

247
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:52,379
Speaker 1: there you go.

248
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,439
Speaker 0: What if they are the same, and they're just written differently?

249
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,640
Speaker 0: What if they are substantially similar, or in fact, derivative, and you just didn't notice because you didn't vet the whole thing out fully?

250
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:06,180
Speaker 0: It's not an easy problem to solve, and I think you're really taking a naive viewpoint.

251
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,859
Speaker 1: When it's a gas pedal, it is.

252
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:08,865
Speaker 1: Yeah.

253
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,780
Speaker 1: You shouldn't have to do all the bullshit for the gas pedal patent.

254
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:15,619
Speaker 0: See, I'm very much of the mind that the government should have to do all of the bullshit for everything.

255
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:16,425
Speaker 1: No.

256
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,150
Speaker 1: Yes.

257
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,320
Speaker 1: Less bullshit is better.

258
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,320
Speaker 1: No, because-- More common sense is needed.

259
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,260
Speaker 0: Common sense is never going to enter into it.

260
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,800
Speaker 0: There's no common sense in anywhere.

261
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,659
Speaker 1: So-- There is common sense right here.

262
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't work on a mass scale.

263
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,399
Speaker 0: I'd like to see you try to run the country.

264
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,679
Speaker 1: I could run the patent office real easy.

265
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:32,298
Speaker 0: Nah.

266
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,039
Speaker 1: In fact, I could do every patent, put them all on my desk.

267
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:39,499
Speaker 1: Um, do you know-- I'll take every single one, I'll have a yes stamp and a no stamp, and you know what?

268
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:42,500
Speaker 1: That no stamp's gonna wear out real quick, so get me like 20 of 'em.

269
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,280
Speaker 0: Do you know how many patents are submitted to the patent office?

270
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,499
Speaker 1: Thousands upon thousands.

271
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,900
Speaker 0: So what, you're just not gonna read 'em?

272
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:48,917
Speaker 1: I'll read 'em.

273
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,260
Speaker 1: If they each get 10 seconds.

274
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,820
Speaker 0: That's terrible.

275
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,820
Speaker 0: I hope you're not serious.

276
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:53,579
Speaker 1: I'm serious.

277
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,219
Speaker 1: That's a terrible-- If your invention is an obvious, so pain--.

278
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,420
Speaker 1: See, here's the problem, is that we-- we're trying to weed out the patents that are obviously not patentable.

279
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,040
Speaker 1: I say, your invention has to be so obviously new and amazing.

280
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:17,540
Speaker 0: If it's not incredibly new and amazing, fuck it, if it's only slightly new and amazing, A lot of things wouldn't be in any way amazing to you, because they increase the yields of a factory by 0.8%.

281
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,699
Speaker 1: That's not patentable, fuck you.

282
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:19,699
Speaker 0: Why not?

283
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,980
Speaker 0: It's just as complex, in fact, more complex, and more valuable.

284
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,079
Speaker 2: Has nothing to do with complexity or value.

285
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,039
Speaker 0: Then what's it have to do with?

286
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:29,040
Speaker 2: Has to do with usefulness on a whole to people.

287
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,567
Speaker 0: That's a huge usefulness.

288
00:17:30,587 --> 00:17:32,940
Speaker 0: to be able to increase the efficiency of a factory by that much?

289
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:34,276
Speaker 2: Whatever.

290
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,075
Speaker 0: I just really don't think you thought this through.

291
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,218
Speaker 2: People like that, you shouldn't be patenting it, it should be given away to everyone, so everyone can do it.

292
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,040
Speaker 0: Oh, so you just-- why even have patents then, because you seem to want to not have them.

293
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:46,079
Speaker 2: You have patents for certain things.

294
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,400
Speaker 0: But you just said if anything's actually valuable, you have to give it away to the people.

295
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:50,459
Speaker 2: That useful?

296
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,520
Speaker 2: I don't think it is that useful.

297
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,618
Speaker 0: So what's the line then?

298
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,659
Speaker 2: The line is what Scott says.

299
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,040
Speaker 0: That's a terrible idea, because you don't know anything about most patents.

300
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,405
Speaker 2: That's why you haven't--.

301
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:07,933
Speaker 2: I could do all the computer patents, definitely, and you'd have someone else just like me, who just knows something about mechanics, who knows something about factories.

302
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,700
Speaker 0: Scott, how do we decide which person?

303
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:11,779
Speaker 2: It's someone who knows.

304
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,800
Speaker 2: It's obvious when someone who knows.

305
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:14,920
Speaker 0: Who decides that?

306
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,760
Speaker 2: The same way it's obvious when a gas pedal patent is obvious.

307
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:19,159
Speaker 0: Who decides that?

308
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,740
Speaker 2: You don't need someone to decide, you say, look, here's a mechanic, he knows how to fix cars.

309
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:24,639
Speaker 0: Who says that?

310
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,460
Speaker 0: Who picks the mechanic?

311
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:26,118
Speaker 1: Anyone.

312
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,811
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

313
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:27,180
Speaker 1: anyone?

314
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,400
Speaker 2: Anyone can do it.

315
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,400
Speaker 2: Any Joe on the street could pick out a mechanic.

316
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,740
Speaker 0: So you're saying Congress should pass a law where they pick a guy off the street and then he goes and picks a mechanic.

317
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:35,758
Speaker 2: That works.

318
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,858
Speaker 0: That's the stupidest thing.

319
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:46,279
Speaker 2: I guarantee it, 99 million times out of 100 million times, most of the time you're going to get someone who's going to pick someone just fine.

320
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,699
Speaker 0: One, I highly doubt that.

321
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:50,099
Speaker 0: Two, that would never work in the real world.

322
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:50,999
Speaker 2: Yes, it would.

323
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,267
Speaker 2: No.

324
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,239
Speaker 2: It would work just fine.

325
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:00,480
Speaker 2: All right, we'll go on the street and we'll ask someone who's not a crazy old person from the crazy old folks' home and we'll say, all right, can you find a mechanic?

326
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,580
Speaker 2: Where's the closest mechanic?

327
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,600
Speaker 2: And the point at the gas station, we'll go there and we'll say, is there a mechanic here?

328
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:05,258
Speaker 2: And there will be.

329
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Speaker 2: And he'll be just a fine mechanic and he'll be able to pick out all the obvious mechanic patents.

330
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,337
Speaker 0: One, are you going to pay him?

331
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,040
Speaker 2: If you make that his new job, then yeah.

332
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,740
Speaker 0: That's still, you'll need more than just him to look at all these patents.

333
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,740
Speaker 0: Two, what if he makes a mistake?

334
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,596
Speaker 0: Who is he accountable to?

335
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:23,200
Speaker 0: Is there any sort of peer review here at all?

336
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,980
Speaker 0: Who gives you the authority to pick the guy off the street?

337
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:29,420
Speaker 1: It's just obvious.

338
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:30,860
Speaker 1: Everything is obvious here.

339
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,059
Speaker 2: It's all about obviousness.

340
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,079
Speaker 0: That doesn't work on a large scale at all.

341
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,280
Speaker 2: We don't need all this bullshit.

342
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,200
Speaker 2: We need to get rid of the bullshit and it's obvious to everyone.

343
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,439
Speaker 2: No, it's not.

344
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,019
Speaker 1: Who is it not obvious to?

345
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,500
Speaker 2: Those are the people in the patent office.

346
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,938
Speaker 2: That's who it's not obvious to.

347
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,479
Speaker 0: I really think you haven't thought this through at all.

348
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:49,527
Speaker 2: I think it's just fine and

349
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:50,149
Speaker 1: that anyone

350
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,692
Speaker 2: who doesn't

351
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:52,077
Speaker 1: have enough common sense

352
00:19:52,398 --> 00:20:05,200
Speaker 2: to be able to say, yes, that person knows what they're talking about and that person doesn't, shouldn't be involved in the patent process anyway and the rest of us can go about it in a completely normal, cheap, and efficient fashion.

353
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,420
Speaker 0: An individual person may be able to say that, but that's their belief.

354
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,880
Speaker 0: That doesn't in any way reflect the beliefs of the masses in a democracy.

355
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,280
Speaker 0: You have to have some sort of process to put this all in place.

356
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:25,280
Speaker 2: So it doesn't make, so you're saying we have a process, then no matter what process it is, if we have one, then that will uphold the beliefs of the democracy?

357
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,940
Speaker 0: How would you implement your idea?

358
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:30,320
Speaker 0: You haven't given any actual useful details.

359
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,499
Speaker 2: Pick a random person.

360
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:33,319
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter who.

361
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:33,899
Speaker 1: How do you pick?

362
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,187
Speaker 1: Me.

363
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:35,138
Speaker 2: I do it.

364
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,239
Speaker 2: It doesn't matter.

365
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:36,818
Speaker 0: Scott, no.

366
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,718
Speaker 2: The president does it.

367
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,479
Speaker 2: The secretary of something does it.

368
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,398
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter who.

369
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:49,820
Speaker 2: Anyone who's not retarded, anyone who doesn't work for the patent office because they're obviously retarded, and anyone who isn't evil and corrupt and paid for by any weird company.

370
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:51,219
Speaker 0: How do you determine that?

371
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:52,680
Speaker 1: Any way you want.

372
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,340
Speaker 1: You can elect them.

373
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,669
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

374
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,040
Speaker 1: any way you want?

375
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,159
Speaker 1: The president can appoint them.

376
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:56,000
Speaker 2: It doesn't matter.

377
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,355
Speaker 0: No, pick a way because you haven't.

378
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:58,500
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

379
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:00,059
Speaker 2: Any of those ways is equally good.

380
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:00,918
Speaker 2: No, they're not at all.

381
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,040
Speaker 2: They're all equally good.

382
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,739
Speaker 0: That's just pathetic.

383
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,248
Speaker 2: No.

384
00:21:04,784 --> 00:21:06,039
Speaker 2: If we elect someone, it's fine.

385
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,160
Speaker 2: If the president appoints someone, that's fine.

386
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,940
Speaker 2: If Congress picks someone, that's fine.

387
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,500
Speaker 0: Because there's a whole procedure in place and there's a lot of peer review and debate and there's a very specific way to do all of those things that is well documented and well understood.

388
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,408
Speaker 2: And it's not working.

389
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:19,700
Speaker 2: so we should throw it the fuck out.

390
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,800
Speaker 0: It works fine for the vast majority of people.

391
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,459
Speaker 1: No it doesn't.

392
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,300
Speaker 1: It works horribly.

393
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:25,158
Speaker 2: You'll look through the patents.

394
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,260
Speaker 2: 99% of patents are just useless.

395
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,700
Speaker 0: Oh, you're talking about patents specifically.

396
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:32,957
Speaker 0: Even then, it works fine for the vast majority of people because the vast majority of people don't care.

397
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,279
Speaker 1: Which means they shouldn't care about it.

398
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,218
Speaker 1: They got nothing to do with it.

399
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,538
Speaker 2: We're the only ones who have to deal with this.

400
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:40,399
Speaker 2: So we should be the ones deciding it.

401
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,760
Speaker 2: If you don't care and you don't care about something, you have no say in it.

402
00:21:45,141 --> 00:21:46,720
Speaker 2: Only the people who care should have a say.

403
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:48,338
Speaker 0: One, that's not the way it is.

404
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,318
Speaker 2: That's how it should be.

405
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:50,859
Speaker 0: How are you going to make it be that way?

406
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:52,359
Speaker 2: That's the way it should be.

407
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:55,000
Speaker 0: I really think arguing ideals like that is silly.

408
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,560
Speaker 0: You gotta have some sort of actual plan or there's really no use in it.

409
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,338
Speaker 2: Here's my plan, we go set all the patents on fire and we start from scratch and Scott's in charge.

410
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a terrible idea.

411
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,080
Speaker 2: I become the new patent general guy and I'm in charge of everything.

412
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,760
Speaker 0: Anyway, no one wants to hear you yell about your crazy plans.

413
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,759
Speaker 0: Let's talk about games.

414
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,800
Speaker 2: Things of the day.

415
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,920
Speaker 2: Alright.

416
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,297
Speaker 2: I got this, for anyone who doesn't know, there's another game that's not DDR.

417
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:29,779
Speaker 2: that's a lot like DDR called Pump It Up.

418
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,638
Speaker 0: Which honestly I'm not really a fan of.

419
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:46,180
Speaker 2: You know, the thing about Pump It Up is the songs aren't as good, the game as a whole isn't as good of a game, but because of the arrows set up, if you get into it, there is greater capability of awesome dancing.

420
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:55,360
Speaker 2: But you know, there's this capability for awesome dancing in DDR too, just Pump It Up has a little bit more because it has four diagonal arrows and a big circle in the middle.

421
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,418
Speaker 2: So there's, you know, more things you can do, especially with a two pad set up.

422
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:08,639
Speaker 2: So here's this video on YouTube of a guy doing a song, I think the song's called Don't Bother Me because that's the name of the YouTube video.

423
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,980
Speaker 2: And he does, basically if you took the pad away and you just saw him dance, you wouldn't know that he was doing a dancing game.

424
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,139
Speaker 2: It's so awesome.

425
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,820
Speaker 2: Not to mention that, but not only is he dancing, he's dancing amazingly.

426
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,939
Speaker 2: Like I want to learn how to dance like that.

427
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,678
Speaker 2: Holy crap.

428
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:27,400
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a good dance.

429
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:29,840
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot of other people do similar things before.

430
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,432
Speaker 0: It's not really...

431
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,879
Speaker 2: I have, but I think this is the best one I've seen.

432
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:35,820
Speaker 0: It only stood out because it was a Pump It Up video, honestly.

433
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,415
Speaker 2: I don't know, I think it's just...

434
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,139
Speaker 0: That and the fact that the crowd was giving him crap before he started dancing, and then they shut up.

435
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,514
Speaker 2: Yeah.

436
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:54,058
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I've seen other videos of like DJ 8-Ball doing DDR, and he's really good, but you know, compared to the videos of him that I've seen, you know, there might be videos I haven't seen.

437
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:57,499
Speaker 2: And this video, I'd have to say this video is number one right now.

438
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what though, compared to actual dancers, he's got nothing.

439
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
Speaker 2: Well, because actual dancers, just dancing period, of course.

440
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,599
Speaker 2: They are the best.

441
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,034
Speaker 2: Yeah.

442
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,900
Speaker 2: Because you don't have to be confined to some arrows at all.

443
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,540
Speaker 2: They're just dancing without arrows.

444
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,269
Speaker 2: But apparently, the Pump It Up World Championship last year had $8,000 for first place, and this year is $30,000 for first place.

445
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,579
Speaker 2: This guy entered last year and didn't win.

446
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:27,479
Speaker 2: So I wanna see the guy who did win last year, and who does win this year, because if it's better than this, holy crap.

447
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:34,640
Speaker 0: I remember when we found, we didn't have DDR in Rochester, but there was this crap, crap arcade place that had a Pump It Up machine.

448
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,230
Speaker 1: Yup, that place, yeah.

449
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:49,720
Speaker 0: It was a broken Pump It Up machine, it was a terrible arcade, it wasn't really an arcade, it was kind of a family center, and it eventually got shut down because a bunch of kids came from the inner city for an event, and they trashed the place, and the police came.

450
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,148
Speaker 1: Yup.

451
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,353
Speaker 0: And after that, the police were like, "You can't have this place anymore, it causes

452
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:53,635
Speaker 0: trouble.".

453
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:02,900
Speaker 1: Why does everything, you know, see our rant about old people taking away the fun things for kids to do, and then kids becoming drug dealers.

454
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, yet in this case, the kids pulled knives on each other, and there was a big fight.

455
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, because the kids didn't have anything fun, so they didn't know how to handle a fun thing.

456
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,880
Speaker 1: It's like, if a kid's never had a playground, and then all of a sudden you gave them one, you know, they'd go on it and hurt themselves.

457
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,319
Speaker 1: Like, you know, if they had a playground all along, then it wouldn't have happened.

458
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,757
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, there's this guy here, on my thing of the day, who had never played Mario 1, ever.

459
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:29,399
Speaker 0: Ever?

460
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:30,079
Speaker 0: Ever.

461
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,520
Speaker 1: How could you, okay, how old was he?

462
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,740
Speaker 0: No, no, second, he was Japanese.

463
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,660
Speaker 1: Whoa, whoa, so had he seen Mario?

464
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:37,559
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

465
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:38,880
Speaker 0: It was hard to follow.

466
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,328
Speaker 0: It was, basically, they're on this talk show, and he's, you know, "This guy's never played Mario, blah, blah, blah, let's watch him play,".

467
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:54,934
Speaker 0: and they show his face in the upper left-hand corner of the screen, and then the rest of the screen is him playing Mario, and he doesn't know what to do.

468
00:25:55,941 --> 00:26:07,895
Speaker 0: He barely gets by the first Goomba, and he doesn't hit any blocks, and he's like cautious and cautious, and he almost falls off of things, takes a while to jump over a pipe, and then he dies on a Goomba, and he's like, "Oh, son of a

469
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:08,196
Speaker 0: bitch!".

470
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:12,199
Speaker 0: The best part is the second time through, he dies on the first Goomba.

471
00:26:13,262 --> 00:26:15,100
Speaker 2: Dying on the first Goomba is always hilarious.

472
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,298
Speaker 0: Then they're yelling at him, "Hit the blocks, hit the question mark blocks,".

473
00:26:18,318 --> 00:26:31,080
Speaker 0: and he hits one, and this mushroom comes out, and it comes around, and it's coming down at him, and you can see him panic, and he's running away from it because he's afraid he's going to get him, and he barely jumps over it, runs away, and meanwhile the crowd's just exploding with laughter.

474
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,199
Speaker 2: See, so I guess it is rare for someone in Japan, you know, everyone there knew how to play Mario.

475
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:37,958
Speaker 0: Except this guy.

476
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:48,642
Speaker 2: As a related note, actually, I just remembered that the three last polls on GameFAQs, which are always interesting, in fact, that's probably the best part of GameFAQs.com, is the polls, the three

477
00:26:48,702 --> 00:26:49,687
Speaker 1: last polls were,

478
00:26:49,988 --> 00:26:51,536
Speaker 2: "Have you ever played the original Mario

479
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:51,918
Speaker 2: Bros.,

480
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,100
Speaker 2: have you ever played the original Final Fantasy, and have you ever played the original Legend of

481
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,490
Speaker 2: Zelda?".

482
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:57,798
Speaker 2: You know what the results are?

483
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:00,932
Speaker 2: Have you ever played the original Super Mario

484
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:01,134
Speaker 2: Bros.?

485
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:02,942
Speaker 2: ? 47.67%

486
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:19,559
Speaker 2: say yes, and I still own the original cartridge, 42.58% say yes way back on the NES, about 13% say yes on an emulated version, and about, let's see, six, seven and a half percent say no.

487
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:21,715
Speaker 2: They've never played Mario.

488
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,779
Speaker 0: Pretty much every gamer in the world has played Mario.

489
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,845
Speaker 2: Well, actually, 1.36% have never played a single Mario game ever, any Mario game at all.

490
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:31,584
Speaker 0: Huh.

491
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:36,080
Speaker 2: 6% say they played another Mario game, but not the original.

492
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:36,731
Speaker 0: Yeah.

493
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:44,904
Speaker 0: Well, it was just, it was crazy that this guy had never played Mario, because he looked like a young, kinda hip dude, and just the video of watching someone play it for the first time, even

494
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:45,165
Speaker 1: though, I

495
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:47,900
Speaker 0: gotta say, I wasn't that bad the first time I played Mario.

496
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,500
Speaker 2: I wasn't that bad the first time I played Mario either.

497
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,200
Speaker 0: I figured it right the fuck out, hit those question marks, get big, jump on things, get a fire flower.

498
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,180
Speaker 2: Yep, I saw someone do it once before me, a little mediocrely, and then I was set.

499
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:05,540
Speaker 2: As soon as I, my hard try was getting the controls, because I'd never used a gamepad before in my life, but as soon as I got that down, I was set.

500
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,959
Speaker 2: I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

501
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,460
Speaker 0: I found the first Warp Zone on my first time through that level.

502
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:10,080
Speaker 2: Awesome.

503
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,799
Speaker 0: 'Cause I saw I could jump up there, so I was like, ooh, maybe I'll break the game, and I jumped up there and there's a thing.

504
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,259
Speaker 2: Yep, the Warp Zone, I think the first Warp Zone in 2-1 was the first thing I found on my own, a secret in any game.

505
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,200
Speaker 0: Were y'all excited, and then you found out that everyone in the world knew about it?

506
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:30,419
Speaker 2: Nah, you know, it was still, I think it still had this sort of like, gleam, like ooh, the Warp Zone, even though everyone knew about it.

507
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,477
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, ooh, you went to the Warp Zone, ooh!

508
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,540
Speaker 0: Those are back in the days when I would throw the holy water in Castlevania 2 at every single goddamn brick in every single square of that game, looking for anything I could find.

509
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,000
Speaker 2: You wanna hear the results of the other polls about Zelda and Final Fantasy?

510
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,779
Speaker 2: They're gonna make you feel real bad.

511
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,000
Speaker 0: Eh, we could save that for a show we should do on old school gaming.

512
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,579
Speaker 2: Well, let me just, I'll just do it real quick.

513
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,259
Speaker 0: Real quick!

514
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:52,780
Speaker 0: Okay, have you ever- 'Cause the show's already long.

515
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,440
Speaker 2: I know, have you ever played the original Legend of Zelda?

516
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,198
Speaker 2: There are, let's see.

517
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:58,437
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna do the no's.

518
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,920
Speaker 2: Assume everyone else is yes, alright?

519
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:07,418
Speaker 2: Anyone who isn't no either owns the cartridge, played it on the NES, or has a remade, emulated version.

520
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:14,976
Speaker 2: 17.33% say no, they have never played the original Zelda, but they've played other Zelda games.

521
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:17,609
Speaker 1: 6.5% have never played a Zelda game, ever.

522
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:22,320
Speaker 0: That's better than I expected.

523
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:23,480
Speaker 0: That's not so bad, really.

524
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,100
Speaker 2: Original Final Fantasy.

525
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:33,617
Speaker 2: 28.82% have never played the original Final Fantasy, but have played other Final Fantasy games.

526
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,640
Speaker 2: About 13% have never played a Final Fantasy game, ever.

527
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,080
Speaker 0: Eh, once again, kind of expected, considering that these games came out a long time ago.

528
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,080
Speaker 2: I know, but only 26% of people have played Final Fantasy 1 on the original NES.

529
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:48,387
Speaker 2: Yeah.

530
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:49,699
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

531
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:52,559
Speaker 0: I guess I'm no longer- Most people haven't.

532
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,679
Speaker 0: I'm no longer jaded by those sorts of things.

533
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:03,920
Speaker 2: Uh, uh, I'm telling you, nowadays in schools, you know, they give you the classic books to read, you know, the Shakespeares.

534
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:07,039
Speaker 2: In the future, they're gonna give you the classic video games.

535
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,000
Speaker 2: You gotta play Zelda, that's your homework.

536
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:10,619
Speaker 2: Bring it back and write an essay.

537
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:11,058
Speaker 0: Yeah.

538
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:12,599
Speaker 2: After you beat Ganon.

539
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:22,320
Speaker 0: So anyway, we, we're gonna do something a little different today, because over the weekend, we had all but one member of the original, original core front row crew over.

540
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:26,200
Speaker 0: And we played games all weekend.

541
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,498
Speaker 1: A whole lot of games.

542
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:42,879
Speaker 0: Now, instead of reviewing all the games, or just talking about the weekend in general, which we might do another day, we're just really gonna go through every game we play the weekend, in order, and kind of do a half session report, half just thoughts on the game while we played it, what happened.

543
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:49,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna, you know, basically how our instance of the game happened and what we did and how other people played.

544
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:59,360
Speaker 0: So I guess just consider this as a look into the gaming lives of Rim, Scott, Alex, Pete, and while Katsu wasn't there this weekend, he is very often right there with all of it.

545
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,919
Speaker 1: And one guy at Moz.

546
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:01,509
Speaker 0: Yeah.

547
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:03,399
Speaker 0: We'll just dig right into this.

548
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,380
Speaker 1: Okay, so we get to Moz, which is where we played our first game.

549
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,900
Speaker 0: Yep, it's a gaming group that we run the website for, it's actually on the same hosting.

550
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,293
Speaker 0: Yep.

551
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:15,538
Speaker 1: And this guy there had a game that we'd never played before that looked kind of interesting called Timbuktu.

552
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:19,860
Speaker 0: Now, he warns us ahead of time, "This game's a real brain buster.

553
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:21,195
Speaker 0: This game made my brain

554
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:21,399
Speaker 0: hurt.".

555
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,219
Speaker 1: It's a deductive game.

556
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,780
Speaker 0: It'll blow your mind, it's so difficult, you'll need a pen and paper.

557
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,475
Speaker 1: And we were like, "Wait a minute, unless the instruction book says we can have pen and paper, we can't have

558
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:32,536
Speaker 1: it.".

559
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:33,559
Speaker 0: And it did say.

560
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,419
Speaker 1: It did say we could have pen and paper, so okay.

561
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:37,994
Speaker 0: I was a little worried, I thought, "Is this game gonna be real

562
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:38,678
Speaker 0: complicated?".

563
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause it didn't look that complicated, and then, you know, we actually got down to it and I read the rules.

564
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:48,137
Speaker 1: I was trying to ignore the guy explaining the rules, 'cause he's not good at explaining.

565
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:52,577
Speaker 1: And I read them, and I was like, "Oh, this game is simple as all

566
00:31:52,598 --> 00:31:52,819
Speaker 1: hell.".

567
00:31:53,140 --> 00:32:04,599
Speaker 0: Now, we actually played the game, and we, you know, we start going through, and let's see, the game was, at least to me, well, you know what, I'll give my impression of it, then Scott can give his.

568
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:06,200
Speaker 0: The game was laughable.

569
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:17,599
Speaker 0: Before we even started playing, when I sat down and the cards were in my hand, and it clicked, and I realized how the game worked, I had fully, fully mathematically solved the game in my head.

570
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,558
Speaker 0: I knew exactly what to do to win, no matter what, unless everyone else did the exact same thing.

571
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,100
Speaker 0: And then it would be random chance.

572
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,300
Speaker 0: I perfectly solved the game, and I made no decisions for the entire game.

573
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:32,259
Speaker 0: I just did exactly what the odds told me to do.

574
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:33,451
Speaker 0: And I won.

575
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,700
Speaker 0: I had more points than everyone else combined.

576
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,336
Speaker 0: I won.

577
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,740
Speaker 1: You didn't have more points than everyone else combined.

578
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:45,140
Speaker 0: I had over a hundred, I had like 170 points, and the rest of you, like one guy had 40.

579
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,540
Speaker 1: We had like 90 something points.

580
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,033
Speaker 1: Barely.

581
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,920
Speaker 1: I think I had over a hundred points.

582
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,960
Speaker 0: No one broke a hundred.

583
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,576
Speaker 0: Except me.

584
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,040
Speaker 1: We had lots of points.

585
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,340
Speaker 0: In fact, I think I have the scores written down, because it was amazing.

586
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,200
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

587
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,500
Speaker 1: You didn't have more than everyone else combined.

588
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:58,539
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I did.

589
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:58,870
Speaker 1: No.

590
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,859
Speaker 0: None of you broke a hundred.

591
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:01,474
Speaker 1: We had 90s of points.

592
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,759
Speaker 1: We had plenty of points.

593
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:04,860
Speaker 0: I only lost five goods in the whole game.

594
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:05,229
Speaker 1: Yeah.

595
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:10,020
Speaker 1: I, on the other hand, I figured the game out after the first round.

596
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:19,220
Speaker 1: So the way the game kind of works, I'm just gonna be real quick, is you have these camels and you move them forward and you get these cards that tell you where the thieves are.

597
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,480
Speaker 1: And you want to move the camels into places where there are no thieves.

598
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:30,940
Speaker 0: Basically you just logically think and you know if you have a 150 or 25 percent chance of being thieved of any number of goods on a certain square.

599
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,819
Speaker 0: And you just act accordingly.

600
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:31,905
Speaker 0: Yep.

601
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,800
Speaker 1: You know where one thief is and then eventually you know where three thieves are.

602
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,818
Speaker 1: Three out of five thieves.

603
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,979
Speaker 0: There was absolutely no decision making at all in this game, unless you really aren't smart enough to figure the game out.

604
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:50,640
Speaker 1: In the first round, I just kind of... The problem was is that my initial placement of guys was really crummy.

605
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:59,431
Speaker 1: So in the first round, after the first move and the first time I saw another thief, I was like, "Oh,

606
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:00,359
Speaker 1: okay."

607
00:34:00,782 --> 00:34:03,580
Speaker 1: And then I knew exactly where to move all my guys for the rest of the game.

608
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,219
Speaker 1: The problem was is my initial placement was terrible, like absolutely terrible.

609
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:19,299
Speaker 1: So I ended up either having to pay a whole bunch of, you know, lose a whole bunch of goods to get my guys out of harm's way, or just lose a whole bunch of goods and it was about equal.

610
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,259
Speaker 1: So in the first round, I lost a whole bunch of goods because my initial placement was based on basically randomness because I didn't know what to do then.

611
00:34:26,782 --> 00:34:30,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, though honestly, initial placement doesn't seem to be a big deal.

612
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,440
Speaker 1: It doesn't, but I put them all like in the same row.

613
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,438
Speaker 1: That was my problem.

614
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:44,500
Speaker 0: Granted, I'll note that in the third camel round, all but one of my camels were in fact in the same row, and I didn't have information about the two rows I could get to from there, and I still didn't lose any goods.

615
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's actually the situation that happened to me in the final round, see.

616
00:34:49,647 --> 00:34:50,599
Speaker 1: The game is five rounds.

617
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,760
Speaker 1: So in round one, I lost a bunch because I didn't know what I was doing.

618
00:34:54,402 --> 00:34:59,200
Speaker 1: In rounds two, three, and four, I didn't lose a single good because I knew what I was doing then.

619
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,340
Speaker 0: But it was too late because I had lost no goods in the first round, too.

620
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:02,840
Speaker 1: Yup.

621
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,040
Speaker 1: So, and then in the final round, I ran into the same situation that RimRent just said.

622
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,400
Speaker 1: he ran into where all his guys were in the same row and he had no information.

623
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,240
Speaker 1: So I ended up losing two goods in the final round.

624
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:23,220
Speaker 1: If I had known what I knew in the second round before the game started, I probably would have lost just as many goods as Rim lost.

625
00:35:23,584 --> 00:35:25,100
Speaker 0: So the game was basically a no-brainer.

626
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,020
Speaker 0: It was just, play the game, and the game is just the same thing, iterated five times.

627
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:33,920
Speaker 1: So once you-- You could play the game four, you could just do four rounds if you wanted to.

628
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,918
Speaker 0: Once you've solved the game, like once you figure out how to win every time, there's no reason to ever play the game again.

629
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:39,472
Speaker 1: Yup.

630
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,100
Speaker 0: By the end of the game, we'd all figured it out and we were just done.

631
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,520
Speaker 1: There was a different way to play the game where instead of starting with the default goods, you draft goods.

632
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:55,820
Speaker 1: And I'm trying to figure out if that will-- All that'll do is change your starting goods in addition to your starting position.

633
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,240
Speaker 0: To me, all it does is make the deduction a lot easier.

634
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,418
Speaker 1: I think it does make it a lot easier because you can either A, give your guys a bunch of diverse goods.

635
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:10,940
Speaker 1: That way, if other people lose a whole bunch of goods, then you'll always have whatever's worth a lot.

636
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,139
Speaker 0: Actually, I don't want to describe it now, but I thought about that and I came up with what I'm pretty sure is the optimal draft.

637
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:16,839
Speaker 1: Yup.

638
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:18,480
Speaker 0: Or at least an optimal draft.

639
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:28,691
Speaker 1: Because then I was thinking what you could do is, let's say your guy was gonna get thiefed of a valuable gold, you could instead sacrifice one of his worthless peppers to go somewhere else.

640
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,098
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

641
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,440
Speaker 0: I'm just saying we probably shouldn't go into that much detail.

642
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,280
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna go into that much detail, but yeah, that's Timbuktu.

643
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,598
Speaker 1: It's a game worth playing once.

644
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,879
Speaker 0: Once and only once.

645
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,360
Speaker 0: There's no reason to ever play it again.

646
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,800
Speaker 1: And then maybe, if you really want to, play it again with the draft rule.

647
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:42,960
Speaker 0: I just found it funny.

648
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,419
Speaker 0: I mean, the guy we play with, the Moz guy, he's a cool guy, but he kept talking about how hard the game was.

649
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,660
Speaker 1: And it wasn't hard at all.

650
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:57,140
Speaker 0: And I think he was kind of miffed that at the end of the game he was trying to talk about his strategy, and all four of us were like, "The game is just this.

651
00:36:57,462 --> 00:36:58,200
Speaker 0: It's this equation.

652
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,299
Speaker 0: It's this thing.

653
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:00,376
Speaker 0: There's nothing to

654
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:00,499
Speaker 0: it.".

655
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,028
Speaker 0: And he was like,

656
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:01,089
Speaker 0: "Eh."

657
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:02,080
Speaker 0: Yup.

658
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:04,460
Speaker 1: It's sort of a wide open game.

659
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:05,333
Speaker 1: Yeah.

660
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,500
Speaker 1: Alright, what do we play next?

661
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,560
Speaker 1: We play Tinkers and Euphrates.

662
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,016
Speaker 1: Yup.

663
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,260
Speaker 0: One of our favorite games.

664
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:11,759
Speaker 0: I'd say it's my favorite game right now.

665
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:12,319
Speaker 1: Alright.

666
00:37:12,744 --> 00:37:14,140
Speaker 1: We haven't played it in a while, though.

667
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it felt real good to play it again.

668
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,565
Speaker 1: It did.

669
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,658
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

670
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,571
Speaker 0: Tinkers and Euphrates is a very difficult, complex game.

671
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:24,300
Speaker 0: to not explain how it works.

672
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:33,240
Speaker 0: And once again, I ran away with the game, partly because I made a good position early on, and I made it so it wasn't easily attacked.

673
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,240
Speaker 0: Scott and Alex and Pete, none of them attacked me, and then it was too late.

674
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:43,360
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, I was getting ready to attack you, actually, with a black external conflict early on.

675
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,980
Speaker 0: But I didn't put any black tiles in there.

676
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,679
Speaker 1: No, I had my black guy down low, and all I needed was water tile tile to come in and get you.

677
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,059
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, but I didn't put black tiles in there, specifically so you couldn't get any points from that.

678
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,218
Speaker 1: I know I wouldn't get points from it, but I would get the half of the monument, which is good enough for me.

679
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:01,080
Speaker 0: I probably would have just internaled right back in, because I had four red tiles.

680
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I had all my red guys.

681
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:03,880
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

682
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:10,195
Speaker 1: The point was, is that, you know, Rym had the monument early, we could have challenged it, we didn't.

683
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,254
Speaker 0: Honestly, Pete could have beaten me, because Pete did the same thing.

684
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:19,380
Speaker 0: I did, almost, in the other corner of the board one round after me, and the game was just between me and Pete.

685
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just, I was gonna build a monument, like, a turn or two later, and then someone put some tiles in the way of it or something, and I couldn't do it.

686
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:29,579
Speaker 1: It was really annoying.

687
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:29,933
Speaker 1: Yeah.

688
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,900
Speaker 1: But they didn't even realize they were blocking my monument, I don't think.

689
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:38,859
Speaker 1: I just had, like, two greens adjacent, I had two greens in my hand, and somehow, like, a black tile got over there in the way.

690
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, well part of it is that I played a really completely off strategy from the way I usually play.

691
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:46,560
Speaker 1: I played off strategy, I played the way Pete usually plays.

692
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,020
Speaker 0: Yep, and I played a new way, because usually I play the way Rym plays, which no one played that way this game.

693
00:38:51,300 --> 00:39:03,460
Speaker 1: You know what, the way you played reminds me of the, now that I think about it, and I'm remembering, because he hadn't played it in so long, that was the way that I was playing right before we stopped playing, where I was building monuments right away and being all crazy.

694
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,040
Speaker 0: Yep, though I know a good counter to it, but I didn't have to do it because no one else did what I did, except Pete, and he was too far away to use the counter.

695
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,820
Speaker 1: I think I gotta go back to playing like that.

696
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,238
Speaker 1: You know why?

697
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:19,280
Speaker 1: Because not only, even if it doesn't win all the time, it's definitely more successful than playing the way I just played, and it's a lot more fun.

698
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:29,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the way you played works really well, but the problem is, strategy, you can't just strategize outside the game, because wherever everyone starts initially, the game is totally different.

699
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:29,774
Speaker 1: Yep.

700
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:36,559
Speaker 0: Like, the strategy I picked worked so well, I think, mostly because no one else was in that area of the board.

701
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,000
Speaker 1: So I should have really started in, when you didn't pick the normal middle starting place You should have started there.

702
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,698
Speaker 1: I should have started there.

703
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,019
Speaker 1: Because that's a damn good place.

704
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,280
Speaker 1: I was, I was thinking of starting there with the green guy to scoop up treasures.

705
00:39:47,580 --> 00:40:01,180
Speaker 0: Because I almost always start in this one place with my black and red guys, like I always start the exact same way, and the fact that I didn't, I chose a less optimal starting point, and no one chose the optimal starting point, at least the optimal in my mind.

706
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,540
Speaker 0: You know, optimal to my strategy, not optimal to the game.

707
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:13,500
Speaker 1: You know what else, if I think about this game that we just played, usually it feels like games have more and bigger conflicts than the one we just played has.

708
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:22,739
Speaker 1: Well, I think that might be the fact that- The game did, if you think about it, it did have a bunch of conflicts that made the board crazy, but it didn't feel like the conflicts you usually have.

709
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:28,419
Speaker 0: Well, because Pete and I kept, you know, just pulling out whenever there was about to be a conflict, because we didn't want to give anyone else points.

710
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,320
Speaker 0: Anytime anyone got close to me, I just abandoned a kingdom.

711
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,999
Speaker 0: I just run away.

712
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,960
Speaker 1: Yup, that was also part of the strategy I was using.

713
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:36,640
Speaker 1: I gotta go back to that.

714
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:43,196
Speaker 0: Plus, honestly, while it didn't make me win, the fact that I had like 11 blue tiles in a row.

715
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,085
Speaker 1: Yeah.

716
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:47,521
Speaker 1: I just- That was the thing, is another time in the game.

717
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:58,736
Speaker 1: I was gonna go, "That's right, early on in the game I had 3 blue tiles, and I was gonna come after you, and then, as the turn, I was gonna do it, you laid out 3 blue tiles in the river behind

718
00:40:58,777 --> 00:40:58,858
Speaker 1: you.".

719
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,355
Speaker 1: And I said, "Okay, next

720
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:00,658
Speaker 1: turn.".

721
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,060
Speaker 1: And then you laid out 3 more, and I was like- Well,

722
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,501
Speaker 1: 2. 2

723
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:04,287
Speaker 1: more, and I was like,

724
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:05,677
Speaker 1: "Nooooo.".

725
00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:07,280
Speaker 0: I just kept jumping those bastards out there.

726
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,860
Speaker 1: And you just kept putting them out in the river, and I was like, "Well, there goes my

727
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:10,446
Speaker 1: plan.".

728
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:15,740
Speaker 0: I just kept drawing them, and I was pissed, because I needed red tiles, because I wanted to internal Pete out of his monument.

729
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,890
Speaker 1: I so wanted to come after you with the blue, and you just kept laying them down, it was ugh.

730
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:22,540
Speaker 0: I didn't even put a blue guy in there for a while.

731
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:24,260
Speaker 1: It was just bad.

732
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:27,660
Speaker 0: I was hoping that you would connect our two kingdoms, right?

733
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:36,340
Speaker 0: And then you'd have the blue army, and then I was gonna pull my black dude out of his massive red fortification, internal your blue guy out, and then put my black dude back in.

734
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:36,827
Speaker 1: Yeah.

735
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,220
Speaker 0: But anyway, the game, that was a good game.

736
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,300
Speaker 1: That was a good game.

737
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:40,959
Speaker 1: What did we play next?

738
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,179
Speaker 0: Then we played Attica.

739
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:43,720
Speaker 1: Oh, right, Attica.

740
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,560
Speaker 0: Which was, the game basically was just between me and Alex, as to who would win.

741
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:48,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.

742
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:56,520
Speaker 0: Well I don't wanna sound, I don't wanna gloat, but I'm pretty sure I've solved Attica, 'cause I've won like every time we've played it in recent memory.

743
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing about Attica is, I just, it's not my favorite game.

744
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:00,817
Speaker 1: Honestly?

745
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:08,000
Speaker 0: I discovered, 'cause I was looking for a review of it to link to, and I just linked to Board Game Geek, but two people compared Attica to Puerto Rico.

746
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:08,880
Speaker 1: Really?

747
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, which I'm not- That's really weird.

748
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, they, in terms of the level of thought and strategy and tactics, and I'm not sure if I agree with them at all.

749
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,119
Speaker 1: I don't think I agree with them one bit.

750
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,160
Speaker 1: Attica is so much less than Puerto Rico in terms of strategy and tactics.

751
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,020
Speaker 0: See, I'm not sure yet.

752
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:37,619
Speaker 0: The only thing I know is that about ten games ago, maybe eight or nine, I came up with a ratio of drawing and playing tiles, and a ratio of cards in my hand- Well, two to three, right?

753
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:38,458
Speaker 0: Actually, no.

754
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:38,727
Speaker 0: Yeah.

755
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:41,040
Speaker 0: It changes as the game, it's really complicated.

756
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,660
Speaker 0: I really can't write it down, but if you want, we could sit down and I could show it to you.

757
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:46,217
Speaker 1: Alright.

758
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:55,099
Speaker 0: And the ratio changes depending on how many of each Amphora-generating bit I've got, and based on how many cards are in my hand and whatever.

759
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:58,779
Speaker 0: And I play by this formula, and I always win.

760
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,340
Speaker 0: But that was two player.

761
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:07,220
Speaker 0: Then we played this four player game, and it worked just as well, except Alex went for the connect two temples and win strategy.

762
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, there you go.

763
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,560
Speaker 0: And he was right there, and he almost did it, and basically, I couldn't stop him.

764
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,799
Speaker 0: Pete could have stopped him, but chose not to.

765
00:43:15,242 --> 00:43:19,198
Speaker 0: So, Scott, the only reason he stopped him is because he had a way to do it that didn't really hurt him.

766
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,239
Speaker 0: It was neutral to Scott, and it prevented Alex from ending the game right then.

767
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,240
Speaker 0: Which eventually caused me to win.

768
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,739
Speaker 1: See, that's the thing I like about Attica, is the territory and the placement of the buildings.

769
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:41,779
Speaker 1: What I don't like is that if the placement of the buildings just ends up kinda bleh, the game just turns into a race, and a race isn't really that fun to see who can build everything quick.

770
00:43:41,943 --> 00:43:42,740
Speaker 1: It's kinda boring.

771
00:43:43,202 --> 00:43:47,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is, the race is usually over really quickly because there aren't many decisions to make.

772
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,839
Speaker 1: I know, that's why.

773
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:55,460
Speaker 1: I wish that the playing, the positioning of tiles was more important and more throughout the game.

774
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,680
Speaker 0: See, I think it is more important.

775
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,760
Speaker 0: The thing is, usually, the game is a foregone conclusion at some point.

776
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,600
Speaker 0: There's a point at which you can say, "Alright, Scott's gonna win," or "Alright, Rem's gonna

777
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:04,670
Speaker 0: win.".

778
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:09,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's only as if it doesn't matter where you place your late things.

779
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,739
Speaker 1: Where you place your early things and where other people place the early things is what matters a lot.

780
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,660
Speaker 1: And where the tiles are added can kind of matter a lot.

781
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:21,900
Speaker 0: I guess I wanna play the game more before I say if there's a lot to the game or not, but I do really like the game.

782
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, I kinda like it.

783
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,080
Speaker 1: It's not a bad game.

784
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,178
Speaker 1: You know, I enjoy playing it, but it's not like, "Woo hoo, let's play

785
00:44:27,258 --> 00:44:27,520
Speaker 1: Attica!".

786
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,333
Speaker 1: It's like, "Alright, I'll play

787
00:44:28,354 --> 00:44:28,537
Speaker 1: Attica.".

788
00:44:28,846 --> 00:44:29,079
Speaker 0: Yeah.

789
00:44:29,682 --> 00:44:30,780
Speaker 0: I guess I'm done two player.

790
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,660
Speaker 0: I've solved two player.

791
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,320
Speaker 0: I'm not sure yet if I've solved four player, so I wanna play it more.

792
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:34,731
Speaker 0: Yeah.

793
00:44:35,322 --> 00:44:50,680
Speaker 1: I just wish that, you know, if it mattered where you put each and every building throughout the game and sort of like a territorial combat type of thing, that if it was more territory grabbing and less race to build everything, I would like it more.

794
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,819
Speaker 0: Though I kinda like the race to build everything.

795
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,877
Speaker 0: But that partly because it's like this mathematical web and I can just get my mind around it and it's fun.

796
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,500
Speaker 0: But it's not fun because I'm playing a game with other people.

797
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:04,779
Speaker 0: It's fun because I'm doing all this math, which is weird.

798
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,740
Speaker 1: Like I could play- The race, to me, feels no better than Candyland.

799
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,599
Speaker 0: This'll sound weird, but I think I could play Attica with myself and enjoy it.

800
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,097
Speaker 0: I think I could sit there and control all four guys and have a hell of a time playing that game.

801
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,679
Speaker 0: Which, actually, I think I might do.

802
00:45:21,147 --> 00:45:21,359
Speaker 1: Okay.

803
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,020
Speaker 0: 'Cause I did that once with Settlers to prove to myself that the game was completely broken.

804
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:25,469
Speaker 0: Yep.

805
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,191
Speaker 0: Yeah.

806
00:45:26,783 --> 00:45:26,935
Speaker 1: Okay.

807
00:45:27,604 --> 00:45:28,700
Speaker 0: Then, that was the end of Moz.

808
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,160
Speaker 0: We went and got Indian food.

809
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,240
Speaker 0: Scott didn't eat much because he was- No, it'd be recent bargaining.

810
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:39,180
Speaker 1: But I had a mango lassi, which is, you know, it's worth going to the Indian restaurant just for a mango lassi.

811
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,718
Speaker 0: Yes, it is.

812
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,259
Speaker 0: Actually, I really wish I could have one right now.

813
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:41,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd be good.

814
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:42,840
Speaker 1: We should learn how to make them.

815
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,560
Speaker 1: It's just like yogurt and mango and something.

816
00:45:44,803 --> 00:45:44,894
Speaker 1: Yeah.

817
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,419
Speaker 0: It's just like, we could make- I'm sure we could make one.

818
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,960
Speaker 1: It's yogurt, mango, and ice, and maybe something else.

819
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:50,600
Speaker 1: You know what?

820
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:50,891
Speaker 1: A straw.

821
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,100
Speaker 0: Let's try to figure that out before the weekend.

822
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:53,597
Speaker 1: Good idea.

823
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,580
Speaker 0: And then we'll make them at the shore.

824
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,679
Speaker 1: We need mangoes.

825
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,518
Speaker 1: We need yogurts.

826
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:57,398
Speaker 0: That'll be badass.

827
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,480
Speaker 1: That would be badass.

828
00:45:58,563 --> 00:45:58,857
Speaker 1: And ice.

829
00:45:59,540 --> 00:45:59,760
Speaker 0: Alright.

830
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:02,779
Speaker 0: Anyway, then we went home after that.

831
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,837
Speaker 0: We hung out a bit.

832
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,760
Speaker 0: Then we played Four Swords.

833
00:46:06,728 --> 00:46:07,460
Speaker 1: Oh, Four Swords.

834
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,080
Speaker 0: Now, we're not going to talk in depth about Four Swords.

835
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,900
Speaker 1: Not the Four Swords for the GBA, the Four Swords for the GameCube.

836
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:19,520
Speaker 0: Suffice to say, Alex hadn't played it before, so he was not quite aware.

837
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:24,459
Speaker 1: For a little while, before he got the hang of the game, he was sort of a ball and chain on the rest of us.

838
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,800
Speaker 0: But then he figured it out right away.

839
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,420
Speaker 1: Then he figured it out within a couple minutes and we were good to go.

840
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:32,576
Speaker 0: But then we got to see his reactions to things like, "Oh shit, Rym has

841
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:33,419
Speaker 0: bombs."

842
00:46:33,806 --> 00:46:33,890
Speaker 0: Or...

843
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:50,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was kind of disappointing because we started our saved game in Death Mountain World 3 and there was no fire rods and barely any bombs and there wasn't any level 2 bombs and anything that's really exciting and crazy in that game didn't happen.

844
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,740
Speaker 0: Granted, the fucking searchlights and the fact that we broke the game, but that's a story for another time.

845
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:11,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, Four Swords is great, but sometimes the only way we would make Four Swords perfect is if there are some times where you just get stuck and you don't know how to proceed and you need to solve some sort of non-obvious, it's not a typical Zelda puzzle.

846
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:15,420
Speaker 1: It's sort of like this weird mystery thing.

847
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:23,799
Speaker 1: Like that one town in Faxanadu that was all misty and it wasn't just obvious how to get out of there and keep going in the game.

848
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:28,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least most of the puzzles, if you just walk around, you'll figure it out.

849
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:36,860
Speaker 0: Except we found one that we couldn't figure out and then it turned out that the game had broken and the key had disappeared and eventually the game just glitched itself to death.

850
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:42,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there were other puzzles that we were stuck in, like running around looking for a moon.

851
00:47:42,086 --> 00:47:43,820
Speaker 1: pearl took us a long time.

852
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:48,500
Speaker 0: Part of that was because we were infighting and yelling at each other a lot.

853
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,099
Speaker 1: That is true, but that's supposed to happen.

854
00:47:50,582 --> 00:48:02,359
Speaker 1: The thing is, the only thing that keeps that game from being super amazing instead of just awesome is the fact that sometimes you sit around for a long time milling about trying to figure out what to do next.

855
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:06,520
Speaker 0: Wii plus DS's could be like the baddest of ass.

856
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,840
Speaker 1: If there was four swords for the DS or the Wii or a combination of both.

857
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,514
Speaker 0: Hell yeah, just the DS.

858
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:12,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, just the DS.

859
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,760
Speaker 1: That would be the best.

860
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,859
Speaker 0: Anyway, we should do a whole show on that, but we played this for hours yelling and screaming at each other.

861
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:18,953
Speaker 1: Then we went to bed.

862
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:19,219
Speaker 1: I think.

863
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:19,928
Speaker 0: Yeah.

864
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:20,594
Speaker 0: Did we?

865
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,367
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

866
00:48:21,387 --> 00:48:22,419
Speaker 0: we just went to bed after that.

867
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:22,999
Speaker 0: Okay.

868
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:26,160
Speaker 0: Well, in addition to staying up late yelling at each other some more.

869
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:26,640
Speaker 0: Of course.

870
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:27,476
Speaker 0: Yeah.

871
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:28,800
Speaker 0: So sad.

872
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,939
Speaker 0: Well, then the next day.

873
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,900
Speaker 1: What did we do the next day?

874
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,659
Speaker 1: We played some games.

875
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, we played a whole bunch of games.

876
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,639
Speaker 1: What games do we play?

877
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:35,293
Speaker 0: Vinci.

878
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:42,180
Speaker 1: That's right, because Alex had purchased Vinci at the Dragon's Den store where Ma's meets.

879
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:42,612
Speaker 0: Yep.

880
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,214
Speaker 0: In fact, we might have played that Saturday night before.

881
00:48:44,234 --> 00:48:44,759
Speaker 0: we played four swords.

882
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:59,740
Speaker 1: It was a game that was on the discount rack and I had heard about this game on the Board Games To Go podcast and I was kind of interested in it, but I didn't buy it because someone told me there was something wrong with the version that was on sale there or something.

883
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,140
Speaker 0: You know what?

884
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,300
Speaker 0: The thing wrong with it is just a misprint in some of the rules.

885
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, we printed out the rules from BoardGameGeek and we were good to go.

886
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,960
Speaker 1: If there's anything else wrong with it, I'd like to know because we totally missed it.

887
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:20,457
Speaker 0: We won't talk about the specifics of the game because that's going to be a whole episode, but it's basically build civilizations, decline those civilizations, drop them into decline, and then start new ones.

888
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:38,853
Speaker 1: The idea is that declining civilizations that are big can still get you points, so you want to start declining your civilization while it's at its maximum, so that way you get points from your new civilization and you continue getting points from the old one at the same time because it's a race to see who gets 120 points first.

889
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:53,297
Speaker 1: So if you decline your civilizations at the right times and build your new ones well and get good ones, then you can get more points in less turns than everyone else and therefore win.

890
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:58,620
Speaker 0: Now we're not entirely sure how deep the game is yet, but it's very fun, it's very challenging.

891
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,759
Speaker 0: Pete won the first game and Alex won the second game.

892
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:12,200
Speaker 1: I came real close to winning both times and I think that the difference between me winning and losing was, like, I could see very small things around the game that would have made the difference.

893
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,971
Speaker 0: Yup, and a lot of it seems to be the actions of other players and the placement on the board.

894
00:50:16,525 --> 00:50:17,400
Speaker 1: Like, in the second game.

895
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:18,680
Speaker 1: In the second game Rym got fucked.

896
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:20,420
Speaker 0: I was way ahead.

897
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:27,265
Speaker 0: I had made an awesome civilization and then I made another awesome civilization with rebirth and I was just shooting away.

898
00:50:27,285 --> 00:50:40,658
Speaker 0: and then Pete had these mountain militia type guys and he in one round busted into the mountains, destroyed pretty much my entire civilization, and then just destroyed me.

899
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,260
Speaker 1: And then I destroyed you a bit more.

900
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:47,460
Speaker 0: And then Scott, like, swept up the remains and I went from winning to losing in one round.

901
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:56,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think what this game comes down to is, you know, you look at the civilizations and what we've been doing is picking civilizations based on their merits alone.

902
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:05,720
Speaker 1: I think what you have to do is pick civilizations not just based on that, but based on the current situation of the board and based on what other players' civilizations have.

903
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:27,580
Speaker 1: If everyone else has the extra point civilizations, like farming, mining, agriculture, you want to take the barbarians and that sort of, and the revolutionaries, to just destroy them so they don't get points and make a giant civilization that reduces them and then decline that and then take the points getting civilizations.

904
00:51:28,201 --> 00:51:34,480
Speaker 0: But, I mean, anyway, the game's a lot of fun and we played it twice because it was that good and it was new and then Alex took it home with him so we couldn't play it again.

905
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,920
Speaker 1: It is really good and I want to play Vinci a lot more.

906
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,445
Speaker 1: You can play it online at this French website, but it has such a bad interface, it's not worth it.

907
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,000
Speaker 1: It's not worth playing on the French website because the interface is so bad.

908
00:51:48,026 --> 00:51:48,519
Speaker 0: It's a stinker.

909
00:51:48,961 --> 00:51:49,559
Speaker 1: It's real bad.

910
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:50,456
Speaker 0: All right.

911
00:51:50,761 --> 00:51:52,800
Speaker 0: Now, we played a game of Fury of Dracula.

912
00:51:53,601 --> 00:51:54,177
Speaker 1: Oh, Dracula.

913
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, that wasn't the first thing we were playing.

914
00:51:56,921 --> 00:52:01,300
Speaker 0: Well, Scott was the Dracula the first time we played way back and then I was a Dracula.

915
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,480
Speaker 0: Pete was the most veteran of all of us who had not yet been Draculas.

916
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,259
Speaker 0: We made him Dracula.

917
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:07,840
Speaker 1: And he sucked at playing Dracula.

918
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,358
Speaker 0: We're sorry, Pete.

919
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:08,818
Speaker 1: And he knows it.

920
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,880
Speaker 0: You were the worst Dracula ever.

921
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:17,920
Speaker 1: He was so, he was worst, I accidentally cheated as Dracula, but he freaking just cheated as Dracula like terrible.

922
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,578
Speaker 0: But you know what?

923
00:52:18,782 --> 00:52:19,520
Speaker 0: That didn't matter.

924
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:24,140
Speaker 0: He would have lost anyway because he, all right, the hunters start in four places, right?

925
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:35,239
Speaker 0: Now, he started, there were basically two cities, two places that were like the obvious places Dracula could start because they were the two points that were furthest away from all the hunters.

926
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,396
Speaker 0: And instead of doing something clever or starting somewhere weird, he started in the most obvious place.

927
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:47,280
Speaker 0: And basically I had decided, you know, I had a little plan and I was going to just march over that way and sweep.

928
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,216
Speaker 0: And I marched straight over to him and unearthed him and he was like, "Ah, shits,".

929
00:52:51,738 --> 00:52:56,339
Speaker 0: and I attacked him and he ran away to the sea and then he cheated by accident because he screwed up.

930
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,080
Speaker 1: He thought that two seas were adjacent when they weren't.

931
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,900
Speaker 0: And then he ran away more and then he cheated again and we killed him and there was no contest.

932
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,080
Speaker 0: At no point could he shake us from the trail.

933
00:53:08,142 --> 00:53:09,600
Speaker 1: No, he really, he had no chance.

934
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:16,299
Speaker 1: As soon as he cheated that first time and we knew where he was, it was game over because he just pounced on him and chopped him up.

935
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,820
Speaker 1: I think what really helped us win, and I think this is going to be the hunter strategy in the future.

936
00:53:20,902 --> 00:53:21,540
Speaker 0: The starvation?

937
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,093
Speaker 1: Yes.

938
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,800
Speaker 1: You take events and items as much as you can in the early game.

939
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:35,540
Speaker 1: As soon as you see Dracula and you're getting ready to deal with him, and you have enough events that you can beat Dracula, because we drew some pretty good events early on.

940
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,155
Speaker 1: We loaded up.

941
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:42,180
Speaker 1: Use the events you have sparingly and don't draw new ones unless you're forced to.

942
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,680
Speaker 0: Now I'd suggested this idea half-heartedly several times, but we'd never gone along.

943
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,019
Speaker 1: We'd never really done it.

944
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,197
Speaker 0: This time we all looked at each other and we're like, "Let's do

945
00:53:50,217 --> 00:53:50,257
Speaker 0: it.".

946
00:53:50,706 --> 00:53:50,959
Speaker 1: Yup.

947
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:51,799
Speaker 0: And it worked.

948
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:57,580
Speaker 1: We just didn't take any events at all, and Dracula was totally starving for events.

949
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,639
Speaker 1: He didn't have any.

950
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,800
Speaker 1: He couldn't escape.

951
00:54:00,341 --> 00:54:03,280
Speaker 1: All he could use were his normal powers and his normal weapons.

952
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:06,160
Speaker 0: He must have felt such a different game.

953
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,060
Speaker 1: And he drew really bad encounters.

954
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:15,680
Speaker 0: When I played Dracula, I felt so powerful, and I was just walking around having my way with the board and just killing anyone who could hear me.

955
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:24,160
Speaker 1: I felt so powerful, like I was doing all sorts of mischievous things, but I also felt so weird that I was me versus everyone, you know?

956
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:26,940
Speaker 0: So everyone won that game except Pete.

957
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:40,239
Speaker 1: I think that the way I have to look at Dracula now is not as a game of hunters versus Dracula, but Dracula is the DM creating a good hunting experience for the hunters, and that's what it's really about.

958
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:54,219
Speaker 1: So if someone's really good at staying away and keeping the hunters on edge, like maybe Dracula sometimes should let the hunters catch onto his trail a little bit to keep the game from getting sour, just to make it more fun.

959
00:54:54,560 --> 00:55:01,100
Speaker 1: I think that's the way the game has to be looked at for maximum fun, because if you just look at it as plain versus, it's not so great.

960
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,400
Speaker 0: Now the last game we played is one of our old favorites.

961
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,399
Speaker 1: Well, you played Vinci again.

962
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,980
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but I said we played that twice.

963
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:08,635
Speaker 0: We played Amoré.

964
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:10,307
Speaker 1: Amoré.

965
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,360
Speaker 0: That is our favorite five player game, even though we played it four player, which is just as good.

966
00:55:14,703 --> 00:55:16,619
Speaker 1: It's pretty close, but it's real damn good.

967
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,677
Speaker 0: I can't think of a five player game I like more.

968
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,977
Speaker 1: Uh, Calus is pretty good, but that's six players actually.

969
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,240
Speaker 0: Amoré maxes out at five.

970
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, hey.

971
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:33,637
Speaker 0: Now, I won this one handily, because I tried a completely new strategy, well not a new strategy, but a strategy that-.

972
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,180
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, we hadn't been playing Amoré correctly.

973
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:37,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, a long time.

974
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,760
Speaker 0: This time is the first time I had ever played the game correctly with the real rules.

975
00:55:41,981 --> 00:55:46,159
Speaker 1: I think we played it correctly early on and then accidentally forgot the rules and messed them up.

976
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just sucked.

977
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,940
Speaker 1: And then playing it online, I learned the real rules.

978
00:55:50,500 --> 00:56:01,042
Speaker 0: Yep, but I went with a whole new strategy this time, because way back we played a game with someone we really don't like and don't know anymore, but he- I don't know if he didn't understand the-.

979
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:07,440
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if he did this by design or by accident, but he didn't get a single victory point in the first kingdom.

980
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:09,820
Speaker 0: Then it ended and it was scored, he had zero.

981
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:14,658
Speaker 0: Then in the second kingdom he had a pile of money and he almost won the game, he came in second place.

982
00:56:15,941 --> 00:56:24,820
Speaker 0: So, I played the strategy of get as much money as I can, I fucked the gods every step of the way, and I got all the money I could in the first kingdom.

983
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,331
Speaker 0: And I built a bare minimum, I just built three pyramids, and I got some power cards and that was it.

984
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was good to buy two power cards though.

985
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,009
Speaker 1: Yes.

986
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,160
Speaker 1: That's what I tried to do, is buy more power cards.

987
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:38,100
Speaker 0: I specifically avoided places that wouldn't let me buy more than one.

988
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:38,556
Speaker 1: Yep.

989
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:44,060
Speaker 0: And I just ripped everyone's asses in the second kingdom.

990
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:49,060
Speaker 0: I bought all the best provinces and I built giant piles of pyramids on them with my giant piles of money.

991
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,740
Speaker 1: I'm beginning to think that's the way to go, because- Unless everyone goes that way.

992
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:59,900
Speaker 1: Yes, that's true, but it seems from playing online, you know, like I really just not winning, but I'm doing okay.

993
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:07,799
Speaker 1: And I've won a couple times, but I try- I use the same strategy here that I use online, which doesn't really result in winning, I really should change it.

994
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:15,840
Speaker 1: But for some reason it just doesn't, like when it comes to my turn to make a move, I look and I go, well that's the obvious move, and obviously that's not the right move.

995
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:21,200
Speaker 0: Well, I used to play the way where I'd try- I'd always try to build the most pyramids on at least one side in the first kingdom.

996
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:27,880
Speaker 1: I did try to build the most pyramids on one side in the second kingdom, and the first kingdom, but- I think you got it in the first kingdom.

997
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,699
Speaker 1: I did get it in the first kingdom, then in the second kingdom I got punned.

998
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:38,419
Speaker 1: I was able to buy back my place that I had all those pyramids in, but the other places I built a ton of pyramids, I wasn't able to get back.

999
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,009
Speaker 0: Yep.

1000
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,120
Speaker 0: Mainly because I had so much money, and Pete also had an insane amount of money.

1001
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:56,420
Speaker 1: I think what I should've done is put all those pyramids from the first kingdom in one place instead of getting the sets of pyramids, then I could've just gotten the one place and been set.

1002
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,400
Speaker 0: And Alex did really well because he got all the temples the first time around.

1003
00:58:01,288 --> 00:58:01,739
Speaker 1: That's right.

1004
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,820
Speaker 1: Got a pile of points.

1005
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:13,420
Speaker 1: The one time I did win online was- no, the two times I won online were because of temples, and the thing- I was trying to get the temples, but Damanhur never came up, and there were only four players.

1006
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:23,260
Speaker 1: See, Amun-Re with four players, not every province comes up, and that really screwed with me, 'cause online, every province always comes up, so I can just say, "I'll get Damanhur,".

1007
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:24,620
Speaker 1: and then it doesn't- it's not in the game.

1008
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,116
Speaker 1: What do I do?

1009
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:25,648
Speaker 0: Yep.

1010
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,320
Speaker 0: Plus, now that I've played the game more, I've realized that bidding is a lot more important than I ever really decided.

1011
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,360
Speaker 1: Bidding is very important.

1012
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,260
Speaker 1: And I'm now willing to spend so much more to get the right province.

1013
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,259
Speaker 0: I mean, I'd throw down 10 and 15 on provinces that only had, like, two pyramids on 'em.

1014
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:40,826
Speaker 2: Mm.

1015
00:58:41,963 --> 00:58:42,399
Speaker 0: That's true.

1016
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:42,849
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1017
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,540
Speaker 0: But it was a fun game, and we played it, and I think that was all the major gaming we did.

1018
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:48,759
Speaker 1: Besides playing Vinci again.

1019
00:58:49,268 --> 00:58:49,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1020
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,820
Speaker 1: But I think we actually talked about both times he played.

1021
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,358
Speaker 0: Yes, we did.

1022
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,700
Speaker 1: I think the first time we played, we all just kinda fooled around.

1023
00:58:56,186 --> 00:58:56,439
Speaker 0: Yep.

1024
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,037
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1025
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, Vinci's the only- I didn't win Vinci, either time.

1026
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:02,780
Speaker 1: I think I wanna play that game a lot more.

1027
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,439
Speaker 0: I do, 'cause I haven't figured it out at all.

1028
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,280
Speaker 0: I got some vague notions.

1029
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,780
Speaker 1: I got a little bit better than vague notions.

1030
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:15,360
Speaker 1: I've got some right ideas about the timing of choosing declines, and how to choose your next civilization.

1031
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:23,840
Speaker 1: Well, when we realized- But anything but end, I can kinda figure out, you know, the thing I'm unsure on is where the best place is to put civilizations, you know?

1032
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:29,438
Speaker 1: Is it good to go after- is it better to just build a big place, or to screw someone else who's ahead of you?

1033
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:31,157
Speaker 1: That's a tough call, you know?

1034
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:38,180
Speaker 1: Like, should you just screw over each player once, that way, you haven't been screwed?

1035
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:39,300
Speaker 1: Is that a good idea?

1036
00:59:39,582 --> 00:59:39,956
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1037
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:50,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I know is that we realized that it's kinda like F1, in that you have a pit strategy, because- That's definitely the- Declining a kingdom is like going into the pit.

1038
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,660
Speaker 0: You can go with a three-pit strategy, or a four-pit strategy, and you gotta decide.

1039
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:07,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kinda crazy that in a board game, the strategy of when and how many times to decline your civilizations is the same exact strategy as in Formula 1 racing of when to go into the pits.

1040
01:00:09,001 --> 01:00:11,531
Speaker 0: We realized that, and it's gotten ahead a moment of, "Ahhhh...".

1041
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:16,273
Speaker 1: If only that, you know, your civilization went fa-.

1042
01:00:16,373 --> 01:00:17,398
Speaker 1: Oh, your civilization does-.

1043
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:17,760
Speaker 1: No.

1044
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,720
Speaker 1: Civilizations seem to go faster when they have lots of fuel, not low on fuel, so it's sorta backwards.

1045
01:00:23,142 --> 01:00:23,228
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1046
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:29,240
Speaker 1: When it's low on, you know, it's like, your civilization goes faster when it has more fuel.

1047
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:29,680
Speaker 0: You know what?

1048
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:30,939
Speaker 0: They're electric F1 cars.

1049
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, awesome.

1050
01:00:33,742 --> 01:00:35,178
Speaker 1: Awesome, that's exactly what they are.

1051
01:00:36,622 --> 01:00:38,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, we played a whole bunch of board games.

1052
01:00:39,122 --> 01:00:40,840
Speaker 1: And we just told you about all the ones we played.

1053
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,218
Speaker 1: Okay, on Thursday of this week, so not tomorrow, but the next day- On to the Metabits.

1054
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,360
Speaker 1: Yes, we are doing an episode of Ask Rimm and Scott.

1055
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:56,120
Speaker 1: You can send in any question via audio feedback, email geeknights@gmail.com.

1056
01:00:56,501 --> 01:00:59,520
Speaker 1: If you want audio feedback, just attach an MP3 or something to that.

1057
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,400
Speaker 0: Also geeknights@frontrowcrew.com.

1058
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,139
Speaker 1: Alright, geeknights@frontrowcrew.com.

1059
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:03,880
Speaker 0: They're both the same.

1060
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:04,499
Speaker 1: They're the same.

1061
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,524
Speaker 1: The front row crew.

1062
01:01:05,584 --> 01:01:09,240
Speaker 1: one's probably better, 'cause that one's more guaranteed to work in the distant future.

1063
01:01:09,483 --> 01:01:09,675
Speaker 1: Yes.

1064
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:14,996
Speaker 1: Or go to our forum, join, and there's a thread that says, "Ask Rimm and

1065
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:15,357
Speaker 1: Scott.".

1066
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,240
Speaker 1: Ask any question you want, and we will spend all Thursday answering people's questions.

1067
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,180
Speaker 0: We've got a lot of good questions, but we want more.

1068
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,460
Speaker 1: We want as many questions as you can get, and we will try to answer as many as we can.

1069
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,130
Speaker 0: Yep.

1070
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:36,338
Speaker 0: Also, because we were asked to, and I would like to say this, even though this will be more of my news tomorrow, but for any of you who are considering going to Otacon, pre-register now.

1071
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:40,680
Speaker 0: The deadline for the discount for early registration is the 4th of July.

1072
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:51,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you do not go to the Otacon.com website and register for the convention now, or before January, July 4th, you will have to pay more money if you decide to go.

1073
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,720
Speaker 0: Yes, it's definitely worth it to pre-register.

1074
01:01:55,501 --> 01:02:00,600
Speaker 1: In fact, you should pre-register for Otacon as soon as possible to pay the least amount of money possible.

1075
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:04,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only exception to that is if you are someone who does panels at cons.

1076
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:05,900
Speaker 1: In which case, you get in for free.

1077
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:07,899
Speaker 1: Or if you're press, legitimate press.

1078
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,100
Speaker 0: You can't be pressed at Otacon.

1079
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,200
Speaker 0: You can't be a bear.

1080
01:02:10,361 --> 01:02:15,120
Speaker 1: Or if you're a guest, or if you're staff, then you don't have to register.

1081
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:15,536
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1082
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,100
Speaker 1: But all you normal people have to register.

1083
01:02:19,062 --> 01:02:21,220
Speaker 0: A lot of their muggles out there.

1084
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:21,672
Speaker 1: Yep.

1085
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,360
Speaker 0: The unwashed masses.

1086
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,063
Speaker 1: Mmm.

1087
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:26,399
Speaker 1: Any other bits?

1088
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:32,179
Speaker 0: I think that's it until tomorrow when we're going to do something we haven't been able to do in a long time.

1089
01:02:32,606 --> 01:02:33,039
Speaker 1: What's that?

1090
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,489
Speaker 0: We're going to review some goddamn anime.

1091
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,760
Speaker 1: Holy crap, what anime are we going to review?

1092
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,680
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

1093
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:39,219
Speaker 1: Awesome.

1094
01:02:40,942 --> 01:02:42,448
Speaker 0: We have a backlog of all this stuff.

1095
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:48,220
Speaker 0: we watched months ago before con season started, and we haven't gotten around to doing any of it because we keep going to cons.

1096
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,980
Speaker 0: And in fact, after the 4th of July, we're going to a con.

1097
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:52,967
Speaker 1: Great.

1098
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, Kinetacon.

1099
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:54,959
Speaker 1: Okay.

1100
01:02:55,901 --> 01:03:00,199
Speaker 0: And then we got Otacon coming up, and then it'll be Fall again, and all the Fall cons come.

1101
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,739
Speaker 0: You know, Ubercon, and all those other ones.

1102
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:03,884
Speaker 1: Uhhh.

1103
01:03:05,421 --> 01:03:05,898
Speaker 1: Alrighty then.

1104
01:03:06,363 --> 01:03:06,577
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1105
01:03:07,322 --> 01:03:07,759
Speaker 0: We're out.

1106
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:17,740
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1107
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,379

1114
01:03:43,981 --> 01:03:47,220
Speaker 2: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

1115
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,080
Speaker 2: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
