1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,542
Speaker 1: It's Monday September 25th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:16,270
Speaker 1: We talk about all the licensing issues of free software.

3
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:18,686
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:21,490
Speaker 1: Well, we've survived the concert on Friday.

5
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:24,490
Speaker 0: It wasn't very difficult to survive not at all.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,170
Speaker 1: There was a lot less pain than I expected and a lot less head banging and a lot less moshing.

7
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:32,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was expecting like some awesome mosh action, you know.

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,689
Speaker 0: But the last time I've had that was at the enter WK concert, which is like three years ago.

9
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:40,159
Speaker 1: So, you know, the music wasn't really conducive.

10
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:42,990
Speaker 1: It was more just good kind of nightwish style.

11
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:47,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll have to wait until this, you know, some maybe punk rock concerts to go to or something.

12
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:50,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we saw Epica and Camelot.

13
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:52,390
Speaker 1: Camelot by the way was badass.

14
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:58,028
Speaker 1: They were indeed the ass of bad and we found this new band that we really like called meta docks.

15
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:58,730
Speaker 0: They're okay.

16
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:05,349
Speaker 1: Well, they were great except that three almost every song they sang was something something something into the fire.

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, not too hot on the lyrics yeah, but at least the lead singer had a really good voice.

18
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:12,714
Speaker 0: Yeah, it kind of surprised me.

19
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:15,522
Speaker 0: He reminded me of the head guy from entertainment system.

20
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:16,566
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:17,990
Speaker 1: Yeah kind of looked like him.

22
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:19,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

23
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:22,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna see them but that's that's later.

24
00:01:23,272 --> 00:01:28,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we also saw operettica and I guess their CDs are better than the live performances.

25
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:39,369
Speaker 0: Yeah that lady sounded like she knew how to sing at least better than us and The guys playing music seemed like they knew how to play but it just didn't sound so hot and no one was really into it.

26
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:40,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

27
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:40,976
Speaker 1: What do you get?

28
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:42,161
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a leader band.

29
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:44,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, and lady was pregnant.

30
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:46,499
Speaker 0: Maybe when she's not pregnant she sings better.

31
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,030
Speaker 0: I don't know what the if that affects it at all.

32
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, they just didn't really have a stage presence.

33
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely lacking in the.

34
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:58,885
Speaker 1: You know, I mean compare that to Roman skills to Epica, which I'm not going to mention exactly.

35
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:07,215
Speaker 1: what made the stage presence awesome Was awesome Alright.

36
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:17,250
Speaker 0: so speaking of you know entertainment system There is a convention in Utica New York, which is pretty much in the middle of New York State called sita con.

37
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:21,250
Speaker 0: It's the SUNY Institute of Technology anime club convention.

38
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:24,530
Speaker 1: It's basically if any of you remember we went to toro con.

39
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:34,938
Speaker 1: It's gonna be like that only bigger and more like a real con and actually three days long Yeah, and it's at SUNY IT in Utica, New York, October 6 7th and 8th.

40
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:41,749
Speaker 0: That's two weeks from now and We are going to be guests there along with a whole shit ton other anime podcasters and stuff.

41
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:46,210
Speaker 1: Yes I mean the people who are going to be guests with us are cool dudes and we know many of them.

42
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,682
Speaker 0: Yep, and basically we're doing a whole bunch of stuff there.

43
00:02:49,742 --> 00:02:51,830
Speaker 0: I mean what we got like four or five panel.

44
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:56,102
Speaker 0: God, we're gonna run a game show wonder a game show an artist alley table.

45
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,369
Speaker 0: They basically let us take this convention over.

46
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:02,645
Speaker 1: so If you want to go to a badass convention that I don't know how much it costs.

47
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:03,167
Speaker 1: It's probably not.

48
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:03,850
Speaker 1: that doesn't matter.

49
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:08,492
Speaker 0: No matter how much the convention themselves screw up We're.

50
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:14,877
Speaker 0: we're doing such a large portion of this convention and the parts that we do We won't screw up.

51
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:21,267
Speaker 0: not that I'm saying they're gonna screw up because I talked to the guy You know the the con guy just a few minutes ago and he seemed like he knew what he was doing.

52
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:21,830
Speaker 0: pretty smart guy.

53
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,512
Speaker 1: Well, they've got.

54
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:26,126
Speaker 1: I mean, they've already got their act together more than several other conventions.

55
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,110
Speaker 1: I'm currently talking to.

56
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,568
Speaker 1: I won't name them to be polite, but they really don't have their acts together, but said Akon does.

57
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:41,221
Speaker 0: yes I mean they got Martin long the video game pianist who's pretty famous and they got Entertainment system and they got a whole bunch of podcasters and they definitely there.

58
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,484
Speaker 0: this conventions gonna be good.

59
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:47,478

61
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:57,830

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,342
Speaker 0: yeah, and so if you want to get more info go to sitakon.com S?

Speaker 0: Yeah, we're gonna plug it all this week and probably next week and that'll be that I know.

66
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:16,582
Speaker 0: I want to talk about this before we do the news.

67
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,043
Speaker 0: just quick.

68
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:18,269
Speaker 0: that computer you got there.

69
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:20,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, I now have two computers on my desk.

70
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:25,590
Speaker 0: So Remember I was yelling last week about my parents crazy computer and the power supplies.

71
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:30,850
Speaker 0: Well, I took the remnants of my parents computer and the only piece that didn't work was the motherboard.

72
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:37,978
Speaker 0: so I chucked that in the trash and I got a $20 motherboard from Newegg.

73
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:41,530
Speaker 0: It was a recertified motherboard from some no-name company.

74
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,999
Speaker 0: $20, okay $30 if you count the shipping.

75
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,022
Speaker 0: and yeah, whatever.

76
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:50,493
Speaker 0: but it was a recertified piece of crap Motherboard.

77
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:53,065
Speaker 0: and let me tell you it's motherboard is a piece of crap.

78
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,733
Speaker 0: Like wow It's compared.

79
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:59,142
Speaker 0: I had to change the bus speed by moving jumpers around.

80
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:00,024
Speaker 0: It's so bad.

81
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:02,250
Speaker 0: But you know what it works.

82
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:19,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, it only has one drawback other than the fact that it's really really cheap and all the problems that come with things that tend To be really really cheap, but the onboard sound card is great playing back and making noise When you try to record with it, it basically can't record.

83
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:21,479
Speaker 1: It's so noisy.

84
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,526
Speaker 0: Well, I can record.

85
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:23,170
Speaker 0: it's just noisy.

86
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:25,174
Speaker 1: You haven't heard.

87
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:27,040
Speaker 1: I'll record something for you and play it back.

88
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,450
Speaker 1: It sounds like like the days before sound cards.

89
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:44,490
Speaker 0: anyway, the point is is that if you want a motherboard that Works perfectly in Linux the sound card the video card every part of this motherboard the network card Works in Linux perfectly with no problems.

90
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:50,907
Speaker 0: But and it's $20 now I wouldn't recommend it for you know everyday use anything.

91
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:54,376
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's not, you know, it does.

92
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,843
Speaker 0: it is a $20 motherboard.

93
00:05:55,883 --> 00:06:08,389
Speaker 0: it lacks a lot of the nice tease of the hundred dollar motherboards were used to from a bit and aces and all those other companies, but For 20 bucks if you got you know a chip that fits in it lying around.

94
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:09,834
Speaker 0: Hey, not bad.

95
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:11,400
Speaker 0: I'm surprised that it worked.

96
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,627
Speaker 0: I wasn't even expecting it to work and it did.

97
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:18,893
Speaker 1: that's amazing Yep, and also I'd like to say I mean we were bitching a lot about the Mac Mini we've got.

98
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:30,289
Speaker 1: but now that I've got this thing sitting here and While it was a less money than the Mac and it is a lot faster than the Mac It's about ten times bigger and four times louder.

99
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,822
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though it's a pretty quiet relatively speaking to other computers.

100
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:38,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's quite compared to the jet engine That's in my old computer.

101
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:39,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's for sure.

102
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:42,097
Speaker 1: Yeah Jet engine that was.

103
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:43,444
Speaker 1: I mean I turned off all those fans.

104
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:44,550
Speaker 1: the thing got right quiet.

105
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:47,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe time for the water cooler in the next one.

106
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,130
Speaker 1: No, no water cooling is mostly silly.

107
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,538
Speaker 1: Yes, I agree all I got to say about that.

108
00:06:53,638 --> 00:07:00,890
Speaker 1: I'm in the I'm in the one big fan school of cooling though I got some non silly news here and I think this is pretty cool now.

109
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:04,009
Speaker 1: I'm sure all of you who are hip to the internet have seen this.

110
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:08,685
Speaker 1: This has been bantered about in the news for a long time and it has finally come.

111
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:10,090
Speaker 1: they finally exist.

112
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:13,130
Speaker 1: You can finally get your hypoallergenic cats.

113
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:15,930
Speaker 0: Great just that I want.

114
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:23,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have genetically engineered cats that produce very little of the protein that causes the vast majority of cat allergy.

115
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:25,376
Speaker 0: You know, I'm not allergic to cats.

116
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:26,440
Speaker 0: I don't want cats.

117
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:27,884
Speaker 0: So I don't care.

118
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:28,887
Speaker 1: See I like cats.

119
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,670
Speaker 1: I'd rather have a dog.

120
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,097
Speaker 1: I really like dogs cats.

121
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:32,645
Speaker 1: I like kittens.

122
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:38,250
Speaker 1: of most cats I don't like but I've met some really nice cats in my day, but I don't know if I'm allergic to cats.

123
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:41,962
Speaker 1: I have a feeling I could become allergic to cats if I ever wanted a cat.

124
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:44,369
Speaker 0: theoretically anyone could become allergic to.

125
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,330
Speaker 1: well No, I mean, I think that I have a predisposition toward becoming allergic to a cat.

126
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:49,274
Speaker 0: I think you might.

127
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,282
Speaker 0: you are allergic to many other things.

128
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:53,250
Speaker 1: The thing is I'm really not allergic to many animals.

129
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,654
Speaker 1: I'm allergic mostly to molds.

130
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,581
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what if the cats get moldy?

131
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:59,390
Speaker 1: if the cat gets moldy your price forgot to feed it.

132
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:05,677
Speaker 0: Maybe you'd be allergic to like the cat littery type stuff because a mold could get in there or something Possibly.

133
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:07,792
Speaker 1: I'm allergic to damn weird things Like.

134
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,670
Speaker 1: I'm not allergic to dogs despite the fact that I grew up with dogs or rats or anything.

135
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,315
Speaker 1: There's two birds and horses.

136
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:17,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought you said you weren't allergic to many animals birds and horses.

137
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:17,448
Speaker 0: That's it.

138
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,530
Speaker 1: Okay Yeah, I'm out of all the animals in the world - ain't so bad?

139
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:28,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm allergic does basically nothing except poison ivy, but I don't know if that's really an allergy or if it's you know It's fucking poison.

140
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:31,203
Speaker 0: So what you know, it's a tough call.

141
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:32,106
Speaker 1: That's the trade-off.

142
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,210
Speaker 1: That's the trade-off.

143
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:37,927
Speaker 1: I'm in max because I am immune to poison ivy insofar as a human can be immune to it.

144
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:38,789
Speaker 1: So it's got Johnson.

145
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:39,586
Speaker 0: You know what?

146
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:54,790
Speaker 0: Being allergic to nothing in exchange for getting poison ivy like a normal person as opposed to being Resistant to poison ivy and having a million other allergies that affect you a lot more frequently in everyday life.

147
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:57,854
Speaker 0: I think I'll take what I got I've gotten by.

148
00:08:58,195 --> 00:09:02,410
Speaker 0: if you could if you could trade your allergies for what I've got in terms of allergies, would you?

149
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:03,661
Speaker 1: I don't know.

150
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:08,639
Speaker 0: All right, I don't think it's such a hard decision.

151
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:17,170
Speaker 1: but well considering that not a few weeks ago I ended up running through a patch of poison ivy without realizing it if I'm wearing pants, I'm all good.

152
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:21,690
Speaker 1: I was wearing shorts Plus if you're wearing pants, you realize it gets all over your pants and then you just don't touch him.

153
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:22,894
Speaker 1: But you probably don't notice.

154
00:09:23,015 --> 00:09:29,000
Speaker 0: and then that's the thing is that if I'm you know, you notice I look around for when I'm in Woods, you don't go into woods.

155
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,684
Speaker 1: So it doesn't matter.

156
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:30,670
Speaker 0: That's another thing.

157
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,717
Speaker 1: Anyway now here's something I found interesting.

158
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:39,730
Speaker 1: a lot of people were talking about how the anti genetic engineering groups You know, basically the nut jobs

159
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:40,130
Speaker 0: Yeah

160
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:52,250
Speaker 1: are All okay with these cats for the most part because they didn't do it in the lab So much as they did it through selective breeding which is effectively the same thing as genetic engineering.

161
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,610
Speaker 1: It just takes longer and it's not as accurate.

162
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,896
Speaker 1: So why it?

163
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,649
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into this we're not doing the show about it.

164
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:07,550
Speaker 1: But how is it that people who are against genetically modifying corn to make it more nutritious are fine with eating corn?

165
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:17,270
Speaker 1: We have now despite the fact that that corn is basically Genetically engineered over hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands of years by humans and the corn we have today did not exist back in.

166
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,522
Speaker 0: The point is is that these people are idiots.

167
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,044
Speaker 0: They're idiots.

168
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:22,790
Speaker 0: They don't understand science.

169
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,994
Speaker 0: They're anti science.

170
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:26,120
Speaker 0: So a scientific argument isn't gonna work.

171
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,293
Speaker 0: They're making decisions based on feelings rather than ration Reason and logic.

172
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:33,018
Speaker 0: so reason and logic will not work.

173
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,569
Speaker 0: You need to somehow change their feelings to change their minds.

174
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,770
Speaker 1: now You know, it's funny because you didn't listen to the my thing of the day yet.

175
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,023
Speaker 1: Yeah, you basically said exactly what James Randi said.

176
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:46,216
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, we're like-minded people.

177
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:47,380
Speaker 1: What do you got in the news?

178
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:56,213
Speaker 0: Oh, so there's a website called turn it in calm God and what it is, it's a website where it You turn.

179
00:10:56,253 --> 00:11:03,663
Speaker 0: if you have a let's say I'm in a college and I have to turn in a paper to my teacher He might say turn it in to turn it in calm.

180
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:05,590
Speaker 0: Here's the codes or whatever for my class.

181
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:07,877
Speaker 0: I turn it in to turn it in calm.

182
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:11,290
Speaker 0: turn it in calm checks to make sure I'm not a plagiarizing fool.

183
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:24,689
Speaker 0: It checks it to make sure I didn't take it out of a journal and it checks it against a bunch of different papers written by other students in other schools around the country and You know papers they found online and all sorts of stuff to make sure I didn't cheat.

184
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:29,710
Speaker 0: and Then if I didn't cheat or if I did it tells the teacher and it gives the teacher my paper.

185
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:39,210
Speaker 0: now a Bunch of students are mad because you know, first of all, you know, you're basically insulting everyone by saying you're all cheaters.

186
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not just that.

187
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:49,570
Speaker 0: it's the point is Turn it in calm takes your papers and stores them and then uses them for its commercial purposes.

188
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:58,474
Speaker 0: This is a for-profit company that takes your paper that you wrote and then uses it to make money by checking to make sure no One else copied it now.

189
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:03,970
Speaker 1: This would be pretty much fine except for the fact that this blatantly violates all sorts of copyright law.

190
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:09,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's just ironic out trying to enforce the copyright law of plagiarism.

191
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:12,239
Speaker 0: They Infringe upon copyright law of.

192
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,224
Speaker 0: I own my paper.

193
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,670
Speaker 0: You can't use it for your business.

194
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:26,766
Speaker 1: Not only that but I ran into a situation once where I actually turned in the same paper to two different professors Mm-hmm, and I realized that one of the professor's used turn it in and the other one didn't.

195
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:30,899
Speaker 1: I realized if the other professor to use Turn it in calm it would have just said that I cheated.

196
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,006
Speaker 1: it wouldn't have come up with.

197
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:34,350
Speaker 1: hey, it's the same guy.

198
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,394
Speaker 1: He wrote that paper.

199
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:36,660
Speaker 1: It just would have said that I cheated.

200
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:38,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would have been tough to.

201
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:42,610
Speaker 1: Actually, I turned one paper into three different professors over the course of two years.

202
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:46,270
Speaker 1: Awesome, I wrote very generic papers on purpose in college.

203
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:54,048
Speaker 0: See, I always tried to be real specific to every topic they were asking, you know I was but I always made sure that it was applicable to other topics.

204
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:57,170
Speaker 1: or They are for all you kids out there in college.

205
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,342
Speaker 1: Here is a brilliant brilliant scam.

206
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:08,266
Speaker 1: if you really want to get out of doing some work Have if you've written a bunch of papers like good papers, you know This paper is good and you could probably apply it to a class.

207
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:09,029
Speaker 1: You've got going now.

208
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:10,154
Speaker 1: Totally.

209
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:19,464
Speaker 1: don't do a big project or turn it in late and half-assed and Then go to the professor very apologetic like I screwed up blah blah blah.

210
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:21,690
Speaker 1: Can I do anything to make up for that bad?

211
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,079
Speaker 1: Grade, I'll write a paper for you.

212
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,865
Speaker 1: I'll do extra credit.

213
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:24,509
Speaker 1: I'll do something.

214
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:35,710
Speaker 1: I'll do extra work to make up for the work I missed and Then they'll probably suggest something and work with them and try to get it to where they suggest that you write on the extra paper For them that you've already written.

215
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:39,610
Speaker 1: Yes, and then you just turn in the paper that you already have written for the other class.

216
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:46,587
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean the reason that plagiarism is wrong is not is because you're taking someone else's work and saying it's your own.

217
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:49,380
Speaker 0: if it's your Own who says you can't use it?

218
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,190
Speaker 0: five times in five different classes?

219
00:13:51,812 --> 00:14:00,744
Speaker 0: You know if I get to computer programming classes and one guy says write a bubble sort and the other guy says write a bubble Sort I'm gonna give them both the same bubble sort.

220
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:01,790
Speaker 0: Why should I do it twice?

221
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:10,905
Speaker 1: Now theoretically the issue there is oh, well you should write the paper to learn But if I wrote a good enough paper before I don't need to learn to write a paper.

222
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:16,309
Speaker 0: that good again exactly All right, so yeah that covers the news is now.

223
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:16,450
Speaker 1: well.

224
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:27,623
Speaker 1: Also, I saw a lot of people's solution to this was to put a copyright notice prohibiting all of these things in Their paper and then suing turnitin.com.

225
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:29,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if anyone actually did that or not.

226
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:43,238
Speaker 1: Oh, no, this is just people like me saying hey do this stuff Yeah, so I urge all of our listeners if you ever run afoul of turnitin.com put all sorts of copyright notices in your paper Mmm and our license your paper with like a Creative Commons license.

227
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll talk about that in a minute.

228
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:51,450
Speaker 1: No protect it with anti-circumvention Measures then DRM on your paper then sue them under the DMCA.

229
00:14:58,474 --> 00:15:00,432
Speaker 1: things of the day Mmm.

230
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:06,650
Speaker 1: now I listen to a lot of podcasts now a lot relative to how many I listened to before but not through a zero.

231
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,523
Speaker 0: Yeah, no I listen to a lot of podcasts relative to how many I listen to.

232
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:14,039
Speaker 1: Oh four years ago You realize I listen to a lot compared to.

233
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,750
Speaker 1: I mean when I started geek nights for the first several months I didn't listen to any podcast.

234
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:21,442
Speaker 0: You hadn't listened to a podcast ever when you started listening when we started.

235
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,553
Speaker 1: I gotta say I still hate the vast majority of Podcasts.

236
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:28,448
Speaker 0: Well, I hate the vast majority of any particular medium Even if it's a me, you know.

237
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:33,084
Speaker 0: Like the vast majority of stuff on YouTube sucks the vast majority of movies suck the vet.

238
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:34,790
Speaker 0: any medium most of it sucks.

239
00:15:35,112 --> 00:15:38,390
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but I've had such bad luck finding good podcasts.

240
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:42,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, most of the podcasts I like are because I know the people who do them personally.

241
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:48,808
Speaker 0: Mmm when I started listening to podcast I subscribed to a whole mess of them and that I basically like.

242
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:50,450
Speaker 0: most of them I don't listen to anymore.

243
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:56,570
Speaker 0: They're very few that I've continued to listen to for a long period of time and I'm deleting and adding new podcasts.

244
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,488
Speaker 0: You know like all the time.

245
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:07,920
Speaker 1: Well, there are two podcasts that deal with skepticism that our listeners had both recommended to me or they had recommended both to me Skepticality and a skeptics guide to the universe.

246
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,110
Speaker 0: I never actually listen to skeptics guide to the universe But I listened to skepticality back in the day and it was okay, but I didn't keep it around.

247
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:17,763
Speaker 1: I like one of the two a lot more than the other.

248
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:19,610
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna bother talking about them.

249
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:27,500
Speaker 1: I could do a show on what podcast I like later, but Skepticality the one I like Recently their most recent episode my thing of the day.

250
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:36,030
Speaker 1: They had an interview by dr Michael Shermer with the amazing James Randi on the amazing meeting and the amazing voyage.

251
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, they had James Randi on the show like three or four times.

252
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this particular interview is really really good.

253
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:49,209
Speaker 1: I if you want to hear James Randi being James Randi, this is probably the most succinct version of that ever.

254
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:54,310
Speaker 0: He tends to be a guy who will say the same things in many interviews.

255
00:16:54,792 --> 00:17:01,981
Speaker 0: so if you want you got to listen to this like one really big interview to get him to say everything he has to say And then you just read his newsletter.

256
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:03,730
Speaker 1: He's a little more off-the-cuff on this one, too.

257
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:04,512
Speaker 1: He gets all.

258
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:07,282
Speaker 1: he talks a lot about how angry he gets he does.

259
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:11,617
Speaker 0: he does gaze an angry little man Yeah, but yeah, he's very amusing.

260
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:12,982
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love James Randi.

261
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:16,781
Speaker 1: I have nothing but the utmost of respect for this man And this interview is just really good.

262
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:17,103
Speaker 0: Yep.

263
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:18,930
Speaker 0: It's cool All right.

264
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,759
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day here is this cool video on YouTube.

265
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:42,110
Speaker 0: what they did is they took a camera and they followed some Skaters around, you know skateboarding kids and they did all kinds of skateboarding tricks and then they took this video to the editing shop or wherever where they have their fancy softwares and their Powerful computers and all that other jazz and they erased all the skateboards.

266
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,436
Speaker 1: Very well, mind you.

267
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:49,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks like someone literally frame by frame Photoshopped out every skateboard.

268
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,110
Speaker 1: I'm sure they use some sort of technology of tracking.

269
00:17:53,391 --> 00:18:00,210
Speaker 0: I think they might have painted the skateboards green or something like that, you know to just erase them, but who knows?

270
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,254
Speaker 0: I don't know how they did it.

271
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,661
Speaker 0: I'm not I don't know about that shit.

272
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:12,172
Speaker 0: And of course we didn't do any research Yeah, but this video is wicked cool because you have these kids basically floating like six inches off the ground I don't know.

273
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:13,076
Speaker 0: How high is a skateboard?

274
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,282
Speaker 1: Not six inches.

275
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:14,543
Speaker 1: God.

276
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:15,870
Speaker 1: Have you ever been on a skateboard?

277
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,254
Speaker 0: I don't know.

278
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:22,310
Speaker 0: four inches off the ground There's some kids floating around because they got no skateboards, but they're skating.

279
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,150
Speaker 1: It's kind of until they start grinding and jumping off of things and then it looks really awesome.

280
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:32,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also cool when they have like a whole bunch of kids skating around, you know, because it's like whoa.

281
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,678
Speaker 0: Anyway, definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it.

282
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:38,765
Speaker 0: It's only a minute and then two minutes long.

283
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:42,658
Speaker 1: So whatever Yeah, not terribly exciting things today.

284
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:43,160
Speaker 1: What do you want?

285
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:44,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's Monday.

286
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:45,067
Speaker 0: It's Monday.

287
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:45,469
Speaker 0: It's Monday.

288
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:49,206
Speaker 1: We were at a power metal concert followed by a weekend of gaming.

289
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:49,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, leave me alone.

290
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:52,437
Speaker 0: That's the thing that I got for you tomorrow.

291
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:55,830
Speaker 1: I'll give you something better the ultimate something of ultimate something.

292
00:18:56,272 --> 00:19:00,347
Speaker 1: No that one of our listeners sent us probably the worst thing I've ever seen on the internet.

293
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:06,220
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, tomorrow I'll talk about some gaming thing because the Tokyo game show was I don't know

294
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:22,608
Speaker 1: About two o'clock in the afternoon maybe one o'clock what the topic of the show would be suddenly and out of the blue because we both Independently had run afoul of the topic at hand in a negative way.

295
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:28,950
Speaker 1: now I was at work and there's this program called PDF creator that you can install it in Windows.

296
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:35,430
Speaker 1: It will give you a printer device that you can print to which will then make PDF files out of anything anything that can print.

297
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,537
Speaker 0: So basically your computer thinks there's a printer.

298
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:42,609
Speaker 0: so any program can print out of a printer that you know is a print a program That's able to print.

299
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:47,710
Speaker 1: Yep, all the program does is take the post script that your printing program makes good thing.

300
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,734
Speaker 1: We have a pop filter here.

301
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:54,069
Speaker 0: Yep, and it turns that into a PDF instead of sending it You know to a piece of paper with ink.

302
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:56,739
Speaker 1: Alright now really great open source.

303
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,369
Speaker 1: and my company comes to me and they want me to install this and all these computers And I think great.

304
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,620
Speaker 1: Finally they're using some open source.

305
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,769
Speaker 1: I can use this as leverage for blah blah blah blah blah blah.

306
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:11,870
Speaker 1: So I get ready to know we install it and first off I assume that they don't know anything about open source software.

307
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,344
Speaker 1: So I look at the license and I see oh, it's GPL.

308
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:15,149
Speaker 1: whatever I can do this.

309
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:28,104
Speaker 1: then I see that there is a version that contains ghost scripts the GPL version and another version that contains ghost script the AFPL version which I had never heard of.

310
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:30,969
Speaker 0: I also Only barely heard of it.

311
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:35,570
Speaker 1: Now all of the internet recommended that you use the a FPL version.

312
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:40,110
Speaker 1: So being a de studious person I decided to look up what the a FPL was.

313
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:43,159
Speaker 1: It is actually the Aladdin free public license.

314
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,207
Speaker 1: to skip all the details until later in this talk.

315
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:55,389
Speaker 1: I discovered that this license effectively Prohibited me from in any way using the software in any way that could ever be valuable ever.

316
00:20:56,651 --> 00:21:11,650
Speaker 1: It basically made it to where I could not legally install this software on any computer at this place at this hospital Though it would have been legal if they had downloaded it themselves without any input from me and then installed it.

317
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:16,389
Speaker 1: Wow, this license is just terrible and I hate these people All right.

318
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:25,794
Speaker 0: So to get to the topic of the show what we're going to talk about today are all the different free software and other Copyright licenses.

319
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:30,010
Speaker 0: you see when you install some software, you know how it says do you agree?

320
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,229
Speaker 0: That is the license of the soft.

321
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,596
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know all those words.

322
00:21:33,656 --> 00:21:36,870
Speaker 1: before it asks you to agree you're signing a legal document.

323
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:38,235
Speaker 1: Well, maybe it is.

324
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:40,343
Speaker 1: essentially it's never been fully tested in court.

325
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:42,010
Speaker 0: But that's that we're not gonna talk about that.

326
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,974
Speaker 1: That's a whole other chance.

327
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:43,918
Speaker 0: the point it.

328
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,308
Speaker 0: well GPL is just tested in court in Germany.

329
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,567
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Anyway, Eulis haven't been.

330
00:21:48,708 --> 00:22:01,469
Speaker 0: yes The point is is that there is a contract which you agree to when you use pretty much any piece of software as to how you can use that software legally and how you cannot use that software.

331
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:04,876
Speaker 0: and They're in open source software.

332
00:22:05,196 --> 00:22:07,061
Speaker 0: There are this set of licenses.

333
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:08,205
Speaker 0: You probably are.

334
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:10,210
Speaker 0: Yeah that are considered open source.

335
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:17,368
Speaker 1: You've probably heard of the GPL the LG PL the the BSD the MIT Creative Commons.

336
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,020
Speaker 0: Creative Commons isn't really used for software, but we'll talk about it.

337
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,586
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's in the same family of things.

338
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:26,463
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then Those are approved open source licenses.

339
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:37,990
Speaker 0: the license on say Microsoft Word is not an open source license because it does not allow you to do certain things with the software That open source licenses do allow you to do with the software.

340
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:39,093
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean from a high level.

341
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:44,698
Speaker 1: the way it works is that by default if you create something it is copyrighted no matter what in The United States.

342
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,570
Speaker 1: yeah in the United States.

343
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,921
Speaker 1: We can't talk about other nations copyright laws for obvious and

344
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:50,928
Speaker 0: we're gonna talk in very general terms

345
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:57,361
Speaker 1: though There are international copyright laws, but we're not going to get into that because you don't care believe me You don't care

346
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,031
Speaker 0: don't care You

347
00:22:58,051 --> 00:22:58,754
Speaker 1: don't care at all

348
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,910
Speaker 0: and that's not the poor talking about open source licenses not about copyright

349
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,827
Speaker 1: But by default if I create something that is copyrightable, it is automatically copyrighted the moment.

350
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:08,890
Speaker 1: I put my pen to the paper.

351
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:11,276
Speaker 0: Yeah If I paint a painting it's copyrighted.

352
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:25,889
Speaker 1: if I write a program copyrighted and it me and automatically I reserve Every single right I am allowed to reserve under that copyright meaning No one else has any right to do anything regarding whatever you just made ever.

353
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:29,270
Speaker 0: So, how do you make open source software?

354
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:37,710
Speaker 0: you're going to have to specifically give up a bunch of rights that you get by default and Thus you need an open source license to do so.

355
00:23:37,830 --> 00:24:02,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, because before the open source licenses were written your only options were really to either do it Half-assedly meaning that all the people using your software were technically using it illegally, but you wouldn't sue them which is a bad situation Mm-hmm, or you could put it in the public domain, which is Basically you not only give up any rights you had over what you created, but you give up the right to say that you made it.

356
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:05,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's talk about public domain first.

357
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:10,590
Speaker 0: public domain Essentially means that no one owns it and yet everyone owns it.

358
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:16,710
Speaker 1: The public owns it is in the public's domain to do with what they will with unlimited use forever and ever.

359
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:21,510
Speaker 0: Now if you want to release something into the public domain you are free to do so.

360
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:36,290
Speaker 0: You can go to creativecommons.org and this little helper thing that will allow you to Anywhere can do anything they want with that work at all.

361
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,302
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean you can do it on your own too.

362
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:47,640
Speaker 1: if you write a Document saying this or if you hand something to someone and you say in front of certified witnesses that I release this to the public Domain you can't take it back ever.

363
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:48,243
Speaker 1: It's done.

364
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:48,725
Speaker 1: Yep.

365
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:49,750
Speaker 0: It's game over.

366
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,323
Speaker 1: Yeah, public domain is the sledgehammer of copyright.

367
00:24:53,343 --> 00:25:01,230
Speaker 0: It's the exact opposite of copyright Yeah, and the way copyright law works generally is that after X years it becomes public domain.

368
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:04,802
Speaker 0: So if you don't do anything, you'll in the United States.

369
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:06,086
Speaker 0: you get something.

370
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:07,270
Speaker 0: you make a work.

371
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:08,976
Speaker 0: It's you copyrighted by you.

372
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:10,583
Speaker 0: the copyright lasts.

373
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:10,844
Speaker 0: for what?

374
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:11,205
Speaker 0: 90 years?

375
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:11,446
Speaker 0: 75 years.

376
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,074
Speaker 1: They keep up in it.

377
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:16,831
Speaker 1: It started at like 7 and 14 and it started like 14.

378
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:20,343
Speaker 0: It's 75 years and that plus your life in a very long time.

379
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:24,249
Speaker 0: and when that time is over It becomes public domain.

380
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:34,990
Speaker 0: And if you go to like archive org, you can see a lot of things that used to be copyrighted But are now public domain like some very old Bugs Bunny and Superman cartoons and stuff like that.

381
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:36,699
Speaker 0: They're all public domain now.

382
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:38,430
Speaker 0: So anyone could do what they want with them.

383
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:50,110
Speaker 1: Yep Now aside from public domain before these licenses your only other option was to try to write Some sort of license that would allow other people to use what you made freely while still reserving some of the rights for yourself.

384
00:25:50,872 --> 00:25:56,050
Speaker 1: But without a lawyer it is almost impossible to write a legally binding contract that would hold up in court.

385
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:58,557
Speaker 1: So this was out of the reach of most people.

386
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:12,584
Speaker 0: now men like Stahlman decided that this was a bad situation Yep, so they came up with a bunch of open source licenses and all sorts of other things That you could just take from a website and put them in your software.

387
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:14,390
Speaker 0: follow some directions and you're good to go.

388
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:19,763
Speaker 1: Yes they're open source from two perspectives one in that they cover open source software and makes things open source.

389
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:28,830
Speaker 1: and two that the licenses themselves are Effectively open source and that you can take the license put your name on it Put the name of your thing on it and it works just as well.

390
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,430
Speaker 0: You can also some of these licenses you can change.

391
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:39,677
Speaker 0: So let's say I have a license here and it restrict it reserves the rights I want and doesn't reserve the rights I don't want except for one right.

392
00:26:40,158 --> 00:26:43,630
Speaker 0: I can add that one right into the license because it's an open license.

393
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:49,810
Speaker 1: Yep in fact if you wanted you could take the GPL put it on something hire a lawyer and have them rewrite it to.

394
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:57,266
Speaker 0: Specifically do whatever you wanted it to do and you can call it like the Scott GPL or the rim GPL or the rim PL or whatever you want to call it.

395
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,440
Speaker 1: You know you were trying to come up with some sort of joke and you couldn't.

396
00:27:01,022 --> 00:27:01,604
Speaker 0: I've got.

397
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:03,270
Speaker 0: I couldn't think of a single acronym.

398
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,059
Speaker 0: That would have been funny.

399
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,010
Speaker 1: I couldn't think of one either.

400
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:10,471
Speaker 1: I was trying to think of how to make some sort of copyright thing that spelled out penis and I was running short on time Here.

401
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:14,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, so creative what creative I want to talk about creative comments for us because it's real simple.

402
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,146
Speaker 1: Yes, it's also remember geek nights is released under the Creative Commons.

403
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:18,849
Speaker 0: Yes, it is.

404
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:26,070
Speaker 0: now What Creative Commons is is it's this group that helps you cop release things and revote.

405
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,549
Speaker 0: You know get rid of your rights that you have by default in a very simple and easy way.

406
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,063
Speaker 0: now They usually don't do so much with software, but they they handle everything else.

407
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:43,328
Speaker 0: They handle music video papers, you know photographs Scientific papers all that kind of stuff.

408
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:48,229
Speaker 0: And all you do is you go to the website and you choose what kind of license you want.

409
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:51,930
Speaker 0: now You have a but the default choice is a Creative Commons license.

410
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:56,024
Speaker 0: But you can also choose some other licenses like they have the public domain.

411
00:27:56,244 --> 00:27:57,910
Speaker 0: They help you get stuff in the public domain.

412
00:27:58,213 --> 00:27:59,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, the way they do this is pretty cool.

413
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:08,570
Speaker 1: we found out just now looking at it that the way they do the public domain is basically they hand you a loaded weapon and They say are you sure you want to shoot your copyright?

414
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:12,261
Speaker 1: Because it's gone forever and we will make sure that it's gone forever.

415
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:12,863
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

416
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:15,170
Speaker 1: They verify it through email and everything.

417
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:36,589
Speaker 0: Yep, the other thing they have it they have a developing nations license, which basically says if Let's say I wrote a book and I put a developing nations license That means in the United States, it's treated like almost any other book, you know, they buy in bookstores and on Amazon, but in say Zamibia if that's even still a place it's free because those people are poor.

418
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:39,357
Speaker 1: Yeah There's a lot of legalese to work that out.

419
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:44,549
Speaker 1: the way this works the Creative Commons is that they give you very simple explanations of what it actually does.

420
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:55,890
Speaker 0: And then the actual license is all this legalese that's been poured over by lawyers and it's it's hidden from you So you don't have to read it, but they tell you in simple terms of what you're what you're getting and you can trust it.

421
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,640
Speaker 1: I mean, we we trust it.

422
00:28:57,781 --> 00:29:02,882
Speaker 0: almost everyone out there trusted Yeah, people have looked it over who and they know what they're talking about.

423
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:04,246
Speaker 0: So it's all good.

424
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:07,650
Speaker 0: another license They have the sampling license just good for music.

425
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:14,229
Speaker 0: It says, you know, you can't just steal my music But if you want to sample my music and make a hip-hop out of it, it's all good.

426
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:25,270
Speaker 0: The only other really cool one they have is the founders copyright which says I want to copyright this like it's 1790 something 14 years of copyright and then public domain.

427
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:32,330
Speaker 0: So anyway by default they give you the Creative Commons license, which has a bunch of different options.

428
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:35,850
Speaker 0: Basically, you have three options, but they can be in any combination.

429
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:40,663
Speaker 0: The first option isn't really an option because you have to choose it.

430
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:41,585
Speaker 0: It's attribution.

431
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:43,430
Speaker 0: You always get attribution.

432
00:29:43,892 --> 00:29:48,830
Speaker 1: All that means is anyone who uses what you you what you made has to say that you did it.

433
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,797
Speaker 1: You were still the author and you can claim that.

434
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:51,319
Speaker 0: Yep.

435
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,021
Speaker 1: That's it.

436
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,873
Speaker 0: The second option is Modifications.

437
00:29:55,953 --> 00:29:58,865
Speaker 0: now there are actually two choices for modifications.

438
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:02,628
Speaker 0: There's Nobody can modify what I have made.

439
00:30:03,951 --> 00:30:06,968
Speaker 0: yes, you can modify what I have made in any way you want.

440
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:19,110
Speaker 0: and Yes, you can modify what I've made as long as you also take your Modification and put it under the same Creative Commons license that you are using this in.

441
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:23,146
Speaker 1: This is also known as share and share alike and it's kind of a viral property.

442
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:23,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's creative.

443
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:30,908
Speaker 0: So let's say I make a podcast podcast called geek nights and someone decides they want to remix the podcast.

444
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:32,348
Speaker 0: That's all good That's cool.

445
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:46,350
Speaker 0: But they do have to say that rim and Scott made the podcast attribution and They do have to give out that newly modified podcast for free with the same exact Creative Commons license.

446
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,530
Speaker 0: They have to share it as well.

447
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:53,110
Speaker 0: They can't modify it and then you know copyright that modification and not give up any of the rights to it.

448
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:53,532
Speaker 1: You know what?

449
00:30:53,954 --> 00:31:02,350
Speaker 1: totally out of the blue and we're not gonna talk about this on the show, but I just realized Let me read the email that mock and I supremacy sent us giving us permission to use their music.

450
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:14,550
Speaker 1: all right, because geek nights is out under the Creative Commons and Theoretically we could virally implant some mock and I supremacy music with the Creative Commons by putting it in geek nights.

451
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:19,510
Speaker 0: But any of their music that we would give is most of their music is downloaded for free on the internet.

452
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,523
Speaker 0: I mean, these guys have bootlegs from their concert on their website.

453
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:24,868
Speaker 0: I know I don't.

454
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:26,132
Speaker 1: I know they don't care But that's just.

455
00:31:26,393 --> 00:31:30,530
Speaker 1: that's the kind of thing that people like Microsoft are really afraid of especially with the GPL.

456
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:34,689
Speaker 1: In fact Microsoft called the GPL a form of cancer at one point.

457
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:38,167
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't remember if a Bill Gates or bomber but one of them said we'll talk about the GPL.

458
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:39,431
Speaker 0: next and The.

459
00:31:39,451 --> 00:31:43,527
Speaker 0: the final thing in Creative Commons license is commercial uses yes or no?

460
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:57,675
Speaker 0: if you say yes That means someone could take an episode of geek nights and sell it You know for money on like a website or they could you know Put it on their radio network that has advertisements, you know within.

461
00:31:57,856 --> 00:32:10,844
Speaker 0: if you say no commercial uses that means that they can't use your work if it makes them money in any way shape or form and You pick those options and you get a Creative Commons license for your works.

462
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:20,010
Speaker 1: now in terms of like say geek nights Or anything really that you make you can always at any time make the license less restrictive on anything you've made.

463
00:32:20,612 --> 00:32:32,510
Speaker 1: So if we released most of geek nights with the non commercial license and then today we decide all right We want to allow commercial we can add apply the new license the less restrictive one to all of the old geek nights.

464
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:37,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, because all it does is that the same license plus we gave up one more right?

465
00:32:37,947 --> 00:32:42,428
Speaker 1: Yep, but you can't Put more restriction on something you've already put out.

466
00:32:42,991 --> 00:32:49,050
Speaker 0: Well, you could and people could choose to use that newer more restrictive license, but they're not obligated to do so.

467
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:59,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if I release geek nights episode blah under the most open Creative Commons Then I re-release it identical under a super restrictive one.

468
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:02,949
Speaker 1: Anyone who wants can just say they're using the old license because it was released under that.

469
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:06,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, as long as they can prove that and all that jazz, but whatever.

470
00:33:06,305 --> 00:33:06,586
Speaker 0: Yeah.

471
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:14,150
Speaker 0: Yeah So you can always with copyright you get all the rights by default and you can only give more of them away.

472
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,435
Speaker 0: You can never take them back.

473
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:17,644
Speaker 0: That's why public domain is such a big thing.

474
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:18,387
Speaker 0: It's like you give it up.

475
00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:19,010
Speaker 0: It's gone.

476
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,374
Speaker 0: Can't get it back All right.

477
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:25,229
Speaker 1: Now the GPL is probably the most famous of these.

478
00:33:25,531 --> 00:33:31,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it is what I mean Linux and all of those things are covered under, you know, GPL's and BSD licenses.

479
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:36,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, GPL is the GNU public license made by Richard Stallman.

480
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:43,710
Speaker 0: Yeah GNU and general public license Yeah, and the the free software foundation and all that good stuff.

481
00:33:43,951 --> 00:33:44,455
Speaker 0: These are acts.

482
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:49,076
Speaker 0: now we're gonna actually talk about the licenses that apply Specifically to open source software.

483
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:51,324
Speaker 0: Creative Commons isn't really open source software.

484
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:52,709
Speaker 0: It's just a license.

485
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:53,130
Speaker 0: in general.

486
00:33:53,190 --> 00:34:05,450
Speaker 0: That's really easy to understand the concept of a license but the GPL is this is for open source software and The GPL in particular is basically the open source software license.

487
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,922
Speaker 1: Now you might have heard a term that's bandied around a lot copy left.

488
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:11,109
Speaker 1: That is what the GPL is.

489
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,196
Speaker 0: That is what it is.

490
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,350
Speaker 1: Copy left as opposed to copyright.

491
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:22,069
Speaker 0: Hahaha Alright now the way the GPL works is let's say I write a program and I put the GPL on it.

492
00:34:22,591 --> 00:34:23,795
Speaker 0: That says a few things.

493
00:34:23,857 --> 00:34:26,668
Speaker 0: The first thing it says is this is copyright.

494
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,600
Speaker 0: Scott Rubin You're not giving up the copyright.

495
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:31,328
Speaker 0: You're saying it's copyright by you.

496
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:40,130
Speaker 0: the second thing is you're saying You can run this program that I have written for any purpose.

497
00:34:40,231 --> 00:34:41,702
Speaker 0: You can run it to do this.

498
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:42,670
Speaker 0: you can run it to do that.

499
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:46,510
Speaker 0: So let's say, you know you write a program that has many possible uses.

500
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:53,170
Speaker 0: I mean open office doesn't really have too many uses but grep has a lot of uses and can be used for many things.

501
00:34:54,012 --> 00:35:00,130
Speaker 0: So someone one guy might want to use it to do a hacking tool and someone might want to use it for a military thing.

502
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:01,124
Speaker 0: That's all good.

503
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:11,437
Speaker 0: the second thing is you give up the right to study how the program works and modify it and You have to give up the source code.

504
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:17,742
Speaker 0: So whereas Microsoft Windows they don't give you the source code They just give you the program with the GPL.

505
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:19,810
Speaker 0: That means you're gonna give up the source code.

506
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:24,830
Speaker 0: You're going to allow people to study that source code and also change it.

507
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:31,010
Speaker 0: The third thing you allow people to do is to redistribute copies of your program.

508
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:41,246
Speaker 0: So, you know if I write a program and I give the source code to rim Or I give a copy of the program to rim he can give it to someone else if it's got a GPL on it.

509
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:49,390
Speaker 0: and The fourth thing you allow people to do is to improve the program and release improvements to the public.

510
00:35:49,511 --> 00:35:52,327
Speaker 0: So rim can take the source code of the program.

511
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:56,947
Speaker 0: I wrote Modify it and then release that source code to someone else.

512
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:00,360
Speaker 1: Yep Now here's what I can't do and these are the important parts.

513
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:03,150
Speaker 1: say I take someone's GPL software and rewrite it.

514
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:07,950
Speaker 1: Okay, if I rewrite it I don't even have to just give the source code back out if I just keep it for myself.

515
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:16,821
Speaker 1: But the moment I try to redistribute the program that I've made with that other code I have to give up the source code from my auditions.

516
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:17,322
Speaker 1: in addition.

517
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:19,570
Speaker 1: If I don't I'm violating the GPL.

518
00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:21,696
Speaker 0: Yes, this is where you get problems.

519
00:36:21,737 --> 00:36:25,810
Speaker 0: Like there was a lawsuit against Linksys because Linksys modified Linux.

520
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:33,195
Speaker 0: They put Linux in their Linksys routers and then they didn't give up the source code to That.

521
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,010
Speaker 0: you know that was in the Linux router.

522
00:36:35,632 --> 00:36:36,554
Speaker 1: Now the bastards.

523
00:36:36,614 --> 00:36:43,574
Speaker 1: the lawsuit was actually complicated because they they argued such things as the value of the software is zero Because it was given away free.

524
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:45,119
Speaker 1: Therefore your GPL is crap.

525
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:46,102
Speaker 0: And yeah, whatever.

526
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:48,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're called the GPL one in the end.

527
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:51,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, the point is, you know TiVo as a similar thing.

528
00:36:52,030 --> 00:37:01,421
Speaker 0: But I think you can get the TiVo software, you know is if you take a GPL program modify it and use it You have to let everyone see your modifications.

529
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:04,010
Speaker 0: You can't keep them hidden, you know that way.

530
00:37:04,413 --> 00:37:10,189
Speaker 0: You know if someone solves a bug in my program Let's say some company wants to use my program and they fix a bug in it.

531
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:12,570
Speaker 0: They have to let everyone know the bug fix.

532
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,674
Speaker 0: They can't hide that from us.

533
00:37:13,754 --> 00:37:18,610
Speaker 1: Unless they modify the program to fix the bug and only use it internally to their own company.

534
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:22,160
Speaker 0: Yeah If they distribute it at all Then they have to do it.

535
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,539
Speaker 0: if you don't distribute it The reason they don't say you have to do it.

536
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,231
Speaker 0: if you don't distribute it is because there's no way to know they did It.

537
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:30,366
Speaker 0: if they don't distribute it, so it's kind of pointless.

538
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:32,436
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, plus they're really.

539
00:37:32,496 --> 00:37:47,543
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a lot of a philosophical argument here that the people who made the GPL Really want free software to take over and the GPL is designed partially to prevent people who make proprietary Software from using anything that was made under GPL.

540
00:37:48,205 --> 00:37:56,110
Speaker 1: So if I make a cool thing Microsoft and it's free Microsoft can't just take it and put it in Windows because now they got to release the source code to Windows.

541
00:37:56,651 --> 00:38:09,062
Speaker 0: Yeah, another thing about the GPL that you might find surprising is that it specifically allows people to sell copies of GPL software, so let's say rim writes a program in the GPL.

542
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:11,969
Speaker 0: I can take it burn it to a CD and sell the CD.

543
00:38:12,431 --> 00:38:18,630
Speaker 0: Yep, I can say hey if you want this program that rim wrote pay me five bucks and I'll let you downloaded it.

544
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:21,104
Speaker 1: There was a minor scandal over God.

545
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:21,688
Speaker 1: What was that?

546
00:38:22,393 --> 00:38:24,106
Speaker 1: Ethereal right or Nessus?

547
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:24,550
Speaker 0: Nessus?

548
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,958
Speaker 1: Nessus is a nice security software out there.

549
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:43,695
Speaker 1: And what happened was he released it under I believe the GPL or something similar and Companies would take his code Repackage it but not modify it and then sell it as their own security solution for a lot of money But not contribute back.

550
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:48,210
Speaker 1: He got so pissed that his new versions of the program don't use the GPL anymore.

551
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:55,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, because these companies were just making money off of his hard work Even though they could have downloaded the exact same program for free from him.

552
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:57,608
Speaker 1: They didn't know better and they paid money for.

553
00:38:57,648 --> 00:39:05,174
Speaker 0: yeah The problem with this is that you would think if the program is given away for free if someone tries to sell it That's okay.

554
00:39:05,234 --> 00:39:08,990
Speaker 0: Because if the person on the other end should go wait a minute I can get that for free.

555
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:19,347
Speaker 0: Why am I paying you, you know, but if people need to sell it, let's say you're selling a Linksys router You're also selling a copy of the software that's in you know, the copy of Linux.

556
00:39:19,427 --> 00:39:20,090
Speaker 0: It's in the router.

557
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:27,850
Speaker 0: That's why you allow selling is because if you didn't allow selling Linksys couldn't sell a router with Linux in it because they have to also sell that copy of Linux.

558
00:39:28,614 --> 00:39:33,030
Speaker 1: Now for anyone who knows a lot more about software We're not going to talk about this in any length at all.

559
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:38,526
Speaker 1: But there's also a license called the LGPL the limited new general public license.

560
00:39:39,088 --> 00:39:47,604
Speaker 1: now real briefly I said before that if Scott makes a program and it's GPL and Microsoft wants to use it They can't without releasing the source code in Windows.

561
00:39:47,644 --> 00:39:48,690
Speaker 1: if they try to put it in Windows.

562
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:55,589
Speaker 0: Now what if instead of a program Scott made a library which is sort of like a program But I'm not going to explain it.

563
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:01,750
Speaker 1: Imagine like a thing that you could stick into Windows that Windows could use to decode say an aug vorbis file?

564
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:09,545
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean an audio file the special kind of audio file Scott made a little thing that allows Windows or any Operating system to just decode that and play it.

565
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:10,109
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

566
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:19,444
Speaker 1: Now if you release that under the GPL Microsoft couldn't put that in any of their products Because it was Steve Ballmer who said that Linux is a cancer.

567
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:20,830
Speaker 1: I just see it here in Wikipedia.

568
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:30,830
Speaker 1: Okay, but the LGPL allows very specifically Libraries to be linked without forcing the viral nature of the GPL onto something.

569
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:38,190
Speaker 1: So the LGPL allows you to make a library that can be used by commercial software without breaking their a proprietary license.

570
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:38,993
Speaker 0: Right.

571
00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:42,910
Speaker 0: So if I want to write a piece of software that plays all kinds of music

572
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:43,412
Speaker 1: But

573
00:40:43,933 --> 00:41:24,685
Speaker 0: you know, I don't want to actually write the decoders that have to decode all the different types of music What I can do is I can go and collect decoding libraries that are open source not modify them in any way and use them in a program that allows people to play all kinds of audio files and All I do is you know in my source code of my program I say if this kind of audio file comes up use that open source code over there to decode it and I can sell this program that contains all these separate libraries and I can license it with a non GPL license as long as all those libraries have an LGPL license.

574
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:27,064
Speaker 0: if they had a GPL license I couldn't do it.

575
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:34,246
Speaker 1: Now the reason behind this and this is really important to the philosophy because there are a lot of people who are Rapidly against the LGPL.

576
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:34,710
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

577
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:43,150
Speaker 1: But there are also a lot of people who see the value of the LGPL Because if you make something like say you make something better than Adobe Acrobat and PDF something great.

578
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:44,353
Speaker 1: You want people to use it.

579
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:50,149
Speaker 1: if you use the GPL then all the big like Microsoft and Apple can't use it.

580
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:59,530
Speaker 1: so most people will not be able to use your library and won't be able to use your file format and It'll just be a pain in the ass and you'll basically prevent what you made from ever being adopted.

581
00:42:00,232 --> 00:42:06,930
Speaker 1: By using the LGPL your thing could be used in Microsoft and Apple and thus gain much more acceptance from actual users.

582
00:42:07,332 --> 00:42:09,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'd become very easy for just about any.

583
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:29,755
Speaker 0: you know If you develop a new protocol or a new file format and you write a library to handle that protocol or format You know if it's only open source then only GPL Only people who are going to use it are people writing GPL software and no one will care about your format or your protocol or Whatever you've written a library for.

584
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:35,648
Speaker 0: but if you LGPL it then people might care and use it all over the place And it might become cool.

585
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:41,274
Speaker 0: Now the other non GPL Open-source licenses.

586
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:46,370
Speaker 0: there are many of them, but two of them that are very similar are the MIT and BSD licenses.

587
00:42:47,073 --> 00:42:49,823
Speaker 0: They come from MIT and Berkeley.

588
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:51,830
Speaker 1: Now the BSD style licenses.

589
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,803
Speaker 1: They're generally all lumped under BSD style licenses.

590
00:42:54,884 --> 00:42:59,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there are a lot of variations They're actually less restrictive than the GPL.

591
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,882
Speaker 1: They are basically almost public domain, but not quite They are the other side of the free debate.

592
00:43:04,923 --> 00:43:06,169
Speaker 1: I mean the GNU people.

593
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:12,290
Speaker 1: I probably anger a lot of people but they're really kind of fanatical about free software.

594
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,820
Speaker 1: Mmm, like I mean there the BSD people are more.

595
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:18,046
Speaker 1: we make free software because we want to.

596
00:43:18,107 --> 00:43:20,618
Speaker 1: we want you to use our free Software for a better world.

597
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:27,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, the GNU people say the same thing But they also say you shouldn't be able to make non free software.

598
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:29,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're kind of crazy now.

599
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,332
Speaker 1: I mean they have valid points But I'll it.

600
00:43:31,794 --> 00:43:38,021
Speaker 1: a lot of times they end up being counterproductive in the sense that they end up Restricting your freedom in order to protect your freedom.

601
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:38,784
Speaker 1: Yeah.

602
00:43:38,804 --> 00:43:39,005
Speaker 1: Yeah.

603
00:43:39,085 --> 00:43:39,407
Speaker 1: Yeah.

604
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:45,125
Speaker 0: But anyway, a BSD license basically says, you know, this is super free.

605
00:43:45,346 --> 00:43:46,530
Speaker 0: It's copyrighted by me.

606
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:52,690
Speaker 0: If you redistribute this software if you give it to someone else you could have kept rhyming.

607
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,945
Speaker 1: You were all set for some poetry was I?

608
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:55,046
Speaker 0: yeah?

609
00:43:55,951 --> 00:44:02,230
Speaker 0: Anyway, if you redistribute the software you can't change the license, so it has to also be a BSD license.

610
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:06,924
Speaker 1: So it's also viral like the GPL, but it's like a vice a benign virus.

611
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:08,208
Speaker 1: It doesn't do anything to you.

612
00:44:08,268 --> 00:44:08,870
Speaker 1: It just sits there.

613
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:15,925
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is allowed a lot of BSD licensed software to be very widely used in distributed.

614
00:44:16,746 --> 00:44:27,728
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and It also says that if you you can redistribute this software in binary form But you have to include this copyright notice and etc, etc.

615
00:44:28,351 --> 00:44:32,747
Speaker 1: Yep, a little different from the GPL which really also requires you to include the source code.

616
00:44:32,948 --> 00:44:35,809
Speaker 0: Yeah Now that's basically it.

617
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,997
Speaker 0: So if Microsoft wanted.

618
00:44:38,017 --> 00:44:45,029
Speaker 0: if you wrote a program with the BSD license Microsoft could come take your code Put it in Windows and no one would ever know.

619
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:55,574
Speaker 1: But they'd have to credit you at some point for saying that this is your code and by including the license you provided Mm-hmm, so they couldn't just take it secretly and stick it in without telling anyone Doing anything.

620
00:44:56,036 --> 00:44:57,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's basically it.

621
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,689
Speaker 1: Yep, they couldn't use the GPL.

622
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:05,337
Speaker 1: They could use the DL GPL depending on how they used it Mm-hmm, and really it just comes down to you.

623
00:45:05,377 --> 00:45:15,435
Speaker 1: probably don't care about the specifics of the licenses But now at least when you hear all these words like blah blah blah LG PL BSD blah blah blah You at least know what the issue is.

624
00:45:15,455 --> 00:45:19,730
Speaker 1: It's just a matter of how many rights that you were given under copyright law.

625
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:20,814
Speaker 1: Do you want to give up?

626
00:45:21,496 --> 00:45:28,523
Speaker 0: this is an anecdote to explain, you know how this affects you in Ubuntu or Debian or Debian?

627
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:30,050
Speaker 0: Linux is the way we were talking about earlier.

628
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:35,604
Speaker 0: You'll notice that Firefox the program does not have the Firefox icon.

629
00:45:35,964 --> 00:45:40,789
Speaker 0: or you know with the fiery Fox around the globe It just has a globe and no fiery Fox.

630
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:49,705
Speaker 0: The reason for that is because Debian and Ubuntu Ubuntu Basically Debian mostly which Ubuntu is based on reporting to.

631
00:45:49,766 --> 00:45:53,803
Speaker 0: they refuse To use non free stuff anything.

632
00:45:53,823 --> 00:45:55,590
Speaker 0: That's not free a hundred percent.

633
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:56,554
Speaker 0: They won't use it.

634
00:45:56,996 --> 00:46:03,369
Speaker 1: and while you can distribute the Firefox logo wherever you want It is not totally totally totally free.

635
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:04,513
Speaker 0: It is not is?

636
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:08,286
Speaker 0: that is a trademark of the Mozilla Corporation and it is not super free.

637
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:09,450
Speaker 0: and you know.

638
00:46:09,717 --> 00:46:10,792
Speaker 0: basically What happens.

639
00:46:10,912 --> 00:46:16,910
Speaker 0: is the the Firefox that you get with Ubuntu or Debian is why you gotta keep saying that?

640
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:19,464
Speaker 0: Yes, you're kind of throwing me off track.

641
00:46:19,505 --> 00:46:26,243
Speaker 0: Don't say Ubuntu Is not exactly the same as the one that Mozilla distributes.

642
00:46:26,323 --> 00:46:30,589
Speaker 0: it is modified, you know from the original source Which is okay in the Mozilla license.

643
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:35,092
Speaker 0: however Firefox says You know.

644
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:40,790
Speaker 0: Mozilla says you shouldn't call it Firefox if you've modified it because it's no longer Firefox.

645
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:43,288
Speaker 0: It's now something else, you know, you can't do that.

646
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:50,744
Speaker 0: So they said hey Debian Ubuntu people Yeah, you should.

647
00:46:50,987 --> 00:46:51,269
Speaker 0: either.

648
00:46:51,992 --> 00:47:00,921
Speaker 0: your choices are don't modify Firefox and use the icon or Don't use the icon and don't call it Firefox.

649
00:47:01,082 --> 00:47:28,400
Speaker 1: now this illustrates one of the biggest longest running and Contended issues in the Linux world the fact that a lot of the people who work on Linux are so pro Free software that they basically shoot themselves in the foot by not allowing very important things that need to be in Linux for normal people to use Linux to be there and you have to go out of Your way to get these things things like Nvidia drivers.

650
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,450
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing with Nvidia drivers.

651
00:47:31,551 --> 00:47:35,109
Speaker 0: Right, is that the Nvidia driver itself existing is?

652
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,522
Speaker 0: Okay, but you're because it's not free.

653
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:39,910
Speaker 0: It's it's you know, closed source.

654
00:47:40,051 --> 00:47:43,510
Speaker 0: You're not allowed and being freezing beer but not freezing speech, right?

655
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:46,943
Speaker 0: You are not allowed to distribute the Nvidia driver.

656
00:47:47,003 --> 00:48:12,530
Speaker 0: if I you know made a Linux Distribution that included the Nvidia driver in it on the CD or whatever Nvidia would come after me you're not allowed to do that, but the other thing is that the Nvidia driver is a closed source driver and It's a closed source kernel module and by linking it into the GPL open source kernel You are in some way, you know tainting the kernel.

657
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,987
Speaker 0: It'll even say tainting the kernel when you do it and it.

658
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:20,189
Speaker 0: you know The super Debian open source fanatics don't like that.

659
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:33,709
Speaker 0: However, without doing that you have pretty much no other choice to have a working Nvidia card that uses your hardware properly And I really have no problem with it at all, you know using an Nvidia driver like that.

660
00:48:34,306 --> 00:48:34,731
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean it's.

661
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:39,346
Speaker 1: I mean there's a lot of Java has issues with this video and mp3 codec.

662
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:45,649
Speaker 1: things have issues with this and These people are to the point where not only will they not I mean some things they could include and they choose not to.

663
00:48:46,372 --> 00:48:51,450
Speaker 1: They won't even make it easy to install these things and they make they just put little barriers in your way.

664
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:57,746
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like I have no problem if you don't include Sun Java with the distribution because it's not legal.

665
00:48:57,826 --> 00:48:58,528
Speaker 0: Sun won't let you.

666
00:48:58,668 --> 00:49:01,139
Speaker 0: actually they're changing Their mind on that but they won't let you.

667
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:01,501
Speaker 0: it's not.

668
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:02,345
Speaker 0: it's against the law.

669
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:07,830
Speaker 0: That's fine But there's no law that says you can't have a button that says install Sun Java.

670
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:11,010
Speaker 0: Click this button and then it takes you to the Sun website and does it for you?

671
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:12,073
Speaker 0: No law.

672
00:49:12,093 --> 00:49:14,561
Speaker 0: that says you can't have a thing to click on.

673
00:49:14,602 --> 00:49:18,618
Speaker 0: that will go and install the Nvidia driver or Even have all the hooks ready.

674
00:49:18,678 --> 00:49:21,030
Speaker 1: So the Nvidia driver is much more easily installed.

675
00:49:21,231 --> 00:49:22,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's nothing.

676
00:49:22,414 --> 00:49:24,260
Speaker 0: there's no law that says you can't do that.

677
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:32,270
Speaker 0: You know, you could include the mp3 Decoding stuff, you know lame and all that other goody stuff with the distribution.

678
00:49:32,371 --> 00:49:34,210
Speaker 0: You could put it right in your distribution legally.

679
00:49:34,592 --> 00:49:38,650
Speaker 0: You could put the Firefox icon and Firefox in your distribution legally.

680
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:43,829
Speaker 0: There's no reason you can't accept because these people have a stick up their ass and they just make it.

681
00:49:44,373 --> 00:49:46,629
Speaker 0: They make Linux crappier than it has to be.

682
00:49:47,031 --> 00:50:07,790
Speaker 0: I mean if you decided to make a Linux distribution that didn't have us and you didn't have a stick up your butt your Linux would be like a zillion times better because not only would it be as awesome as Ubuntu is but But now anyone who uses it won't have to spend a half hour learning shit just to install stuff.

683
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:09,030
Speaker 0: They need to do their work now.

684
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:16,769
Speaker 1: Imagine if someone who was outside of the realm of being sued over any sort of copyright Made Scott likes to call it the fuck you Linux.

685
00:50:16,893 --> 00:50:17,631
Speaker 0: Yeah fuck you.

686
00:50:17,671 --> 00:50:17,952
Speaker 0: version

687
00:50:17,972 --> 00:50:20,640
Speaker 1: of Linux that includes all of these drivers

688
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:34,710
Speaker 0: the Nvidia driver the ATI driver the NDIS wrapper Java Flash all that stuff that mp3 stuff all the stuff that doesn't come with Linux by default Not only that essential for making it useful in everyday

689
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:39,306
Speaker 1: Like a fork kernel that integrated all this stuff properly and just straight

690
00:50:39,427 --> 00:50:43,012
Speaker 0: up yep Just screw all the laws You know.

691
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:49,937
Speaker 0: include all the non free stuff and the free stuff together in a pre-built Linux distribution That was as good as Ubuntu.

692
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:50,720
Speaker 1: Ubuntu.

693
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:57,150
Speaker 0: if you put that on the internet somewhere It would just blow every freaking other Linux distribution out of the water.

694
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:01,990
Speaker 0: It would do some serious damage to Windows and Mac because everyone would go holy shit.

695
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:05,490
Speaker 0: There's a usable Linux that doesn't require any learning or effort.

696
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:09,649
Speaker 0: But because these people have the stick up the butt that's not gonna happen.

697
00:51:10,213 --> 00:51:12,910
Speaker 1: Yep, so we need some freedom fighters out there to make fuck you Linux.

698
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:16,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know granted like corporations couldn't use the fuck you Linux.

699
00:51:17,136 --> 00:51:17,949
Speaker 1: Well anyone like that.

700
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:25,990
Speaker 1: But you and me all of you out there who are sick of Windows don't want to spend all the money it takes to get A Mac but are afraid of Linux.

701
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:31,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, how many times do you see someone installing Linux and then going oh I couldn't get my wireless driver to work?

702
00:51:31,931 --> 00:51:36,929
Speaker 0: that's because the NDIS wrapper that makes your wireless card work isn't a hundred percent free.

703
00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:48,529
Speaker 0: if there was a distribution someone could easily write a Program that would automatically make your wireless card work with NDIS wrapper, but they don't because it's not a hundred percent free.

704
00:51:49,152 --> 00:51:53,348
Speaker 0: So you have this case of super freedom making things less free.

705
00:51:53,549 --> 00:52:01,029
Speaker 1: granted We don't want to really get into the issue of Why some of these things like the Nvidia drivers aren't open when there's really no reason for them not to be.

706
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:07,505
Speaker 0: yes If I had my way, you know, I got to say this I would love for the Nvidia driver to be open source and free.

707
00:52:07,686 --> 00:52:08,429
Speaker 0: that would be ideal.

708
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:14,146
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't help that the reasons Nvidia gives for making it closed source are mostly bollocks.

709
00:52:14,186 --> 00:52:15,390
Speaker 0: They are mostly bullshit.

710
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:17,729
Speaker 1: I mean if they had valid reasons, I'd say oh, oh.

711
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:18,672
Speaker 1: But

712
00:52:18,752 --> 00:52:38,848
Speaker 0: in a world in which you have to feel world where you had to face the reality that the Nvidia driver and other things Like it are not going to be open source and free But are still absolutely necessary for useful desktop computing in a Linux environment You just have to kind of take it in the ass and say alright, I'll deal with it.

713
00:52:38,928 --> 00:52:40,749
Speaker 0: I don't care I want a working computer.

714
00:52:41,171 --> 00:52:46,790
Speaker 0: It's much more important than your useless ideals which are only harming your free software more than helping it.

715
00:52:47,212 --> 00:52:50,228
Speaker 1: There is no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable.

716
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:57,930
Speaker 0: Yes So I hope you all now understand the difference between all the different open source Kidding.

717
00:52:58,752 --> 00:53:04,669
Speaker 1: I hope you understand that these words exist and that they have some kind of meaning and that copyright is out there.

718
00:53:05,652 --> 00:53:19,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, but maybe someone out there you go on Wikipedia and look up the different licenses and learn Specifically what they mean, I would recommend against reading the Wikipedia's because while they're very thorough They are not very accessible.

719
00:53:19,877 --> 00:53:24,030
Speaker 1: No, I would recommend just googling around looking for summaries of all of these licenses.

720
00:53:24,131 --> 00:53:25,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are plenty of summaries of these licenses.

721
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,230
Speaker 1: I wouldn't go to the GNU website either because there is faster the crazy free guys live.

722
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,282
Speaker 1: There is more propaganda there than there is license.

723
00:53:34,483 --> 00:53:36,290
Speaker 1: Yes, no offense to the GNU people.

724
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:38,641
Speaker 1: I mean you people do a lot of great work, but good God.

725
00:53:38,741 --> 00:53:40,570
Speaker 0: Well, they've done a lot of great work lately.

726
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:42,689
Speaker 0: They've just been updating their old great work.

727
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:45,498
Speaker 1: Maybe we should start calling it GNU Linux again.

728
00:53:45,518 --> 00:53:59,327
Speaker 0: No, I'm not gonna talk to have that argument on the show And that was geek nights with rim and Scott.
