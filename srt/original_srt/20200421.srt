1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,021
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday April 21st 2020.

2
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:15,069
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:20,430
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about Luigi's Mansion 3 on the Nintendo switch.

4
00:00:21,378 --> 00:00:22,408
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:30,050
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, this would normally be meta but you know, we keep trying to increase and improve the geek nights pipeline.

6
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:35,370
Speaker 1: So we are now streaming the show live on YouTube with both my face and Scott's face.

7
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:41,028
Speaker 1: Thanks to three OBS's plus an nginx server that was pre-configured by someone.

8
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:49,290
Speaker 0: we sent money to Yep, and you know, it's surprisingly requires a lot of technological hardware or software.

9
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:55,300
Speaker 0: You can either spend money on hardware to make life easy Yeah, or you can spend a lot of time configuring free software.

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,067
Speaker 0: that kind of sucks or you can buy software.

11
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:00,373
Speaker 0: That's easier Suck so much.

12
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:06,170
Speaker 1: what sucks though is that OBS is better than a lot of paid software in many areas, but not all areas.

13
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:08,088
Speaker 0: No, not all areas at all.

14
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:11,225
Speaker 0: Yeah, we may it seems to be working enough.

15
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:25,470
Speaker 1: Yeah The problem I run into the most but we'll save this for a Monday show, but what I will say is that Consumer level networking hardware like consumer level routers just are not great and I got too used to real stuff.

16
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:31,310
Speaker 0: I think the biggest problem really is just that you can only have so many.

17
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:36,190
Speaker 0: You know video input devices on like a computer, right?

18
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,170
Speaker 0: So if you want to have like multiple things involved you want to stream from different devices?

19
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,227
Speaker 0: Like I want to show you my iPad screen and my face and rims face and right.

20
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:48,070
Speaker 0: it's like with audio.

21
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,720
Speaker 0: Well, there's a device called like a mixer.

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,510
Speaker 0: you could buy and get a lot of expensive.

23
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:54,818
Speaker 1: I spent a lot of money on our mixer But you know what you can get.

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,069
Speaker 0: but you could just get a mixer Yeah, but even better plug as many audio input devices as you want into it and you're good to go.

25
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:09,893
Speaker 1: Yeah but but the other word is because that mixer is like Bob like the technology behind mixers is mature and stable it just Works.

26
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:12,323
Speaker 0: Well, that's not the problem of just working right?

27
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:14,030
Speaker 0: So OBS is the video mixer.

28
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:15,515
Speaker 0: It just works.

29
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:22,098
Speaker 0: The problem is it when you buy an audio mixer a hardware one It has a million audio inputs on it.

30
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:31,468
Speaker 0: Yeah, your computer doesn't have enough video inputs Right that OBS will all recognize independently of each other as different inputs.

31
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:40,210
Speaker 1: Yep So you need to use which I can't just buy a video capture card But then you run it all the encoder issues and you can only have so many of those for one computer.

32
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,254
Speaker 0: But I so this.

33
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:50,330
Speaker 0: so the RTMP solution is where Europe instead is each device That is a video source will stream itself to a server.

34
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:51,232
Speaker 0: Right.

35
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:57,350
Speaker 0: So and then OBS will look at all of those streams as individual video sources and mix them.

36
00:02:57,952 --> 00:03:01,910
Speaker 0: But now every video source you have has to have a network connection.

37
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:06,230
Speaker 0: So like my really good camera doesn't have a network card in it.

38
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:07,814
Speaker 0: It has Wi-Fi, but it doesn't.

39
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:09,498
Speaker 0: it can't stream over that Wi-Fi.

40
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:10,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

41
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,564
Speaker 0: That's not a feature it offers.

42
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:18,730
Speaker 1: So but I am using a Significant amount of bandwidth streaming everything both internally and from Scott.

43
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:20,539
Speaker 0: We have a lot of bandwidth.

44
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,324
Speaker 0: you might as well use it.

45
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:22,250
Speaker 1: You know what next Monday show?

46
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,370
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll talk about this pipeline.

47
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,816
Speaker 1: I like what we had to do because I realized something kind of an aside talking to some of our friends who want to stream stuff.

48
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:30,824
Speaker 1: Scott and I can figure this out because we are both professionals like.

49
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,956
Speaker 1: we know a lot about Technology and network.

50
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:38,283
Speaker 0: if a normal person wants to do anything that out-of-the-box Software just does not do and they don't want to pay money.

51
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:39,530
Speaker 0: They are boned.

52
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:55,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, like good luck getting this going if you don't know networking Never mind, like how to synchronize audio and video and like time codes and shit Mm-hmm at the 8 megabytes of network buffers that are hanging out in here, but I digress it's Tuesday.

53
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,357
Speaker 1: We can talk about games and the first news we got?

54
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:01,387
Speaker 1: you might remember a humble little game called torchbearer.

55
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,135
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, I've only played it a few times.

56
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:08,870
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so they have announced torchbearer second edition.

57
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,020
Speaker 1: Wonder if it's like advanced Dungeons & Dragons second edition.

58
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:21,628
Speaker 0: All right, they've got a huge Kickstarter that launched today And there are various levels of kicking that you can select from right.

59
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:25,408
Speaker 0: the lowest level I think is just the game PDF and that's it.

60
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:29,803
Speaker 0: The highest levels include three different books.

61
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:36,750
Speaker 0: There's the regular book There's a dungeoneers handbook and there is a scholars guide.

62
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:39,839
Speaker 0: Oh, no, the dungeoneers handbook is the first book.

63
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:51,175
Speaker 0: that's like players handbook right scholars guide I think is the I mean the highest one is for game stores only The feasting.

64
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:54,004
Speaker 0: I'm talking about the three books not the levels.

65
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:55,830
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we got the lore masters manual.

66
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:56,935
Speaker 1: We've got the dungeon.

67
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:59,870
Speaker 0: the lore masters manual is like extra optional rules.

68
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:00,914
Speaker 0: And then there's basically.

69
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:04,410
Speaker 0: the other two books are basically players handbook and DM guide.

70
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:09,835
Speaker 0: And then if you go higher in level you can get Game master screens.

71
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:11,601
Speaker 0: you can get action decks.

72
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,407
Speaker 0: I highly recommend the action deck.

73
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:16,215
Speaker 1: They make torchbearer Million times easier to play.

74
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:17,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you can.

75
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:28,930
Speaker 0: you get two but you can add more decks if you you know as bonuses at The end and then you can also get these bad counters to help you do tracking on the GM screen.

76
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:31,988
Speaker 0: I'm like, you know what what turn it is and whatnot.

77
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:37,130
Speaker 0: Then they have some player decks which are okay.

78
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:41,228
Speaker 0: There's a deck of cards you can use to keep track of like your armors and weapons and things like that.

79
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:45,910
Speaker 0: conditions Those are not necessary, but they're nice with a wooden card holder, right?

80
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:55,635
Speaker 0: They're adding some wooden card holders some a custom wooden dice set and some custom metal coins based on how high your pledge Increases to.

81
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:59,470
Speaker 1: I own too many custom metal coins from other kickstarters already.

82
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:02,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah seems unnecessary.

83
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:26,029
Speaker 0: So if you want to play a an RPG that is a dungeon crawling RPG Much in the ways of first ed D&D but is modern and streamlined and better in every conceivable way And this is now your time you maybe you maybe you have torchbearer first ed in which case I don't know what you're gonna do with that probably

84
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:30,025
Speaker 1: How many different editions of burning wheel.

85
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:31,149
Speaker 1: do I have a bunch of books of?

86
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:33,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not getting a torchbearer 3e.

87
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:41,453
Speaker 1: they can right unless I play torchbearer 2e so much Yeah, but the thing is the games I'm actually into playing right now I mean online.

88
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:53,113
Speaker 1: I got a good burning wheel game going and even then we found there are multiple sub editions of burning wheel gold that have slightly different rules on some pages, so Yeah, I mean In game.

89
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:59,410
Speaker 1: the dispute in game came down to what is the fourth word on page whatever and then we discovered the problem.

90
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:08,260
Speaker 0: Right normally I would have been like I think under normal circumstances I would have looked at torchbearer 2e and said man I love torchbearer, but I didn't play torchbearer 1e enough.

91
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,046
Speaker 0: I could just play torchbearer 1e more, right?

92
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:13,638
Speaker 0: Why would I buy 2e?

93
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:15,670
Speaker 0: when am I even gonna play it, right?

94
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:22,050
Speaker 0: Even though the people who make it right, you know Luke and Tor, you know, I'm close with them, right?

95
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,368
Speaker 0: I like to support them.

96
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:24,917
Speaker 0: Why would I go for this?

97
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:27,489
Speaker 0: but I guess I'll go for it because what else do I have to do?

98
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,075
Speaker 1: Yep, all I mean I'll be.

99
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,121
Speaker 1: so this is the time.

100
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,850
Speaker 1: if you want to play RPGs do it on discord.

101
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:35,002
Speaker 1: It just works.

102
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:41,350
Speaker 1: the burning wheel game We've been playing on discord works so well and for there's a design consideration like user experience thing.

103
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,734
Speaker 1: I didn't really think about one.

104
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:47,387
Speaker 1: our friend Tracy made a bot that handles all the burning wheel dice rolling like perfectly.

105
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:59,815
Speaker 1: Mmm, but two Basically, whoever's role-playing in the voice chat Everyone else all the table chatter and like the meta commentary and all the nonsense people are just typing that shit without Interrupting the role-playing.

106
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:03,690
Speaker 1: So it actually ends up being better role-playing than I tend to see at the table.

107
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:05,274
Speaker 0: That's not bad.

108
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:08,170
Speaker 1: Like I did not expect that to happen, but it happened.

109
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:17,349
Speaker 1: So people are like posting gifs in the text channel and DMing each other and there's a bunch of fun going on in there While like the three characters involved in the scene are doing their thing.

110
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:22,709
Speaker 0: My hope is that I'm so starved for role-playing by the time we can role-play in person again.

111
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:25,882
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah that I mean be.

112
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:26,284
Speaker 0: this will be.

113
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:35,970
Speaker 1: I've got a Blades in the dark game that I'm ready to run that I was planning to start like Literally right after PAX East and then of course things happen.

114
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:45,006
Speaker 1: But I don't know if I could run that game on discord because not all the people involved I think could get the technology working enough for voice chat to work effectively.

115
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:47,732
Speaker 1: So I'm just gonna wait Mm-hmm.

116
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:51,162
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah all their news in the gaming world.

117
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:52,806
Speaker 1: This is actually kind of a big deal.

118
00:08:53,087 --> 00:09:00,877
Speaker 1: There is a Significant update to Mario maker - uh, oh, yeah, I would say well It's also the final major update.

119
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:07,963
Speaker 0: there might be minor updates in the future, but there will not be supposedly major updates in the future, but it added the one.

120
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:15,147
Speaker 1: the sole feature that Prevented me from going deep into Mario maker the lack of phanto.

121
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:19,309
Speaker 1: Yeah Well while I care about phanto got a great deal.

122
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,830
Speaker 1: The thing I wanted more than anything was to be able to make a world.

123
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:28,250
Speaker 1: I wanted to be able to make a bunch of different levels that are all tied together and make a real game.

124
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:32,270
Speaker 1: I'm not interested in these like one-off like level experiences.

125
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,129
Speaker 1: I want to make a world with secrets and stuff and that is exactly what you can do now.

126
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can even put mushroom houses on your map.

127
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:45,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, I saw that image and I knew what was happening and then I read what was added and that was exactly it.

128
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,813
Speaker 1: That's the main feature.

129
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:49,762
Speaker 0: So now Mario also added a lot of other things.

130
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:52,209
Speaker 0: They added frog suit boomerang suit.

131
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:58,470
Speaker 0: Can the Mario to mushroom the Mario to mushroom which will let you jump on bad guys and throw them.

132
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:03,318
Speaker 1: That actually is really important to a kind of level I kind of want to make that now I can actually make like.

133
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:06,911
Speaker 1: that adds a feature I needed to make the specific kind of Level.

134
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,857
Speaker 1: I'm going deep into this.

135
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:09,218
Speaker 0: Yeah.

136
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:16,209
Speaker 0: Yeah the previous Mario maker 2 updates added a lot of stuff But this one adds a lot more than those ones added.

137
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,750
Speaker 1: I wonder if these were all intended to be smaller updates along the way and Nintendo accelerated it because of the quarantines.

138
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:23,733
Speaker 0: Well, I figured it.

139
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:33,910
Speaker 0: when Nintendo seems to do is they put out a game and their DLC strategy seems to be don't be evil Right, don't like don't do micro transaction bullshit, right at least not on console.

140
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,894
Speaker 0: They do it on this.

141
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:38,848
Speaker 0: some mobile apps like the Animal Crossing, you know, whatever right?

142
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:41,222
Speaker 0: Yeah The Animal Crossing that's on the phone.

143
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:53,310
Speaker 0: Not the that the real one Yeah, and then what they do with the DLCs is I think it a allows them to release the game earlier When there's still stuff in development, they can still get the game out there, right?

144
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:58,128
Speaker 0: And then to the DLCs that they sell they make a little bit more money.

145
00:10:58,188 --> 00:10:59,956
Speaker 0: It's like alright We sold you the game for 60 bucks.

146
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:01,382
Speaker 0: We did 60 bucks of work.

147
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,250
Speaker 0: We're gonna give even more stuff.

148
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:14,204
Speaker 0: It might be free like it is with Mario maker or it might not be like with Zelda There was some extra stuff you had to pay for or Smash Brothers you to pay for All right, and that stuff keeps the game alive, right.

149
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:20,190
Speaker 0: and by keeping the game alive You are basically extending the sales on that game, right?

150
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,380
Speaker 0: So someone like Mario maker 2 came out.

151
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,954
Speaker 0: people played it and they played it out Right.

152
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:27,087
Speaker 0: and now it's like well, why would you play Mario maker 2 now?

153
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,095
Speaker 0: It's that game got played out

154
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:32,730
Speaker 1: and if you want now like most of the things people are making is just like kaizo nonsense

155
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:43,050
Speaker 0: right, but now by putting this update people are gonna come back to Mario maker who have it already and People who say maybe bought a switch to get animal crossing.

156
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:47,806
Speaker 0: Maybe Mario maker will be their second game because that game is basically like it new again.

157
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:49,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though it's not new.

158
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:51,623
Speaker 0: So that's the Nintendo strategy.

159
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,449
Speaker 0: It seems to be working.

160
00:11:52,851 --> 00:12:09,790
Speaker 0: There's also big free updates coming to Animal Crossing to no one's surprise and there are also updates to the my Nintendo app On the phone which is sort of like your Nintendo account manager, but also in-game communicator app.

161
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,770
Speaker 0: It's pretty useful Even though it's imperfect.

162
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,021
Speaker 0: But for example what the major thing really is?

163
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,470
Speaker 0: you're gonna be able to buy games in the eShop on your phone.

164
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:23,574
Speaker 0: So like if someone says hey, there's a big Mario maker update and you say oh snap I really wanted that game.

165
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:30,169
Speaker 0: you take out your phone you buy Mario maker and then the next time you go to your switch Mario makers Already installed because you just paid for it on your phone.

166
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:37,911
Speaker 0: So that update is I think out in Japan now soon and will probably be coming soon to the u.s I guess.

167
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:43,587
Speaker 1: but yeah as of this like Mario maker now is like a must-buy game for a switch like this.

168
00:12:43,707 --> 00:12:45,954
Speaker 0: is Mario maker - yeah Yeah, Mario maker - for sure.

169
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:47,359
Speaker 1: Like there is nothing else.

170
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:48,603
Speaker 1: I want from the game.

171
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,750
Speaker 1: They filled every hole I cared about.

172
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,576
Speaker 0: Oh, there's more things I could want from there.

173
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:58,303
Speaker 1: Uh, I mean, yes, I would like a full Super Mario - Like game style.

174
00:12:58,384 --> 00:13:00,957
Speaker 1: but I Understand why they're not gonna do that.

175
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:08,529
Speaker 0: My main concern is that if I make a boo house I can't make that like field of infinite boos up in the ceiling.

176
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,692
Speaker 0: There's no way.

177
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:12,898
Speaker 0: there's no way to do that with the right.

178
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can let that go.

179
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:15,485
Speaker 1: I can let that go.

180
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:28,824
Speaker 0: I Know I know also mad that if you make a boo ring Apparently if you get up if you're inside of a dry bones shell you can jump on kill the boos in a boo ring Which I'm not a fan of.

181
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:30,490
Speaker 0: Who my boos alone?

182
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:42,859
Speaker 1: I did not know that because that's not something I could do in any old Mario Mario maker - has a lot of those things That like you don't realize the interactions between different Enemies and they're not really documented.

183
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,749
Speaker 1: like I there's that one huge other documented but very it's.

184
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:46,431
Speaker 0: you know You have to.

185
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:47,534
Speaker 0: really there's

186
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:57,564
Speaker 1: a YouTube channel deep that I think I made a thing of a long time ago that does experiments to show Specific undocumented behaviors and then show you how to use them in levels

187
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:04,264
Speaker 0: like if you watch Mario maker - streamers you will about once a day see something you didn't know before.

188
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:05,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

189
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:06,250
Speaker 0: it's pretty fascinating.

190
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:08,447
Speaker 1: So this is pretty exciting stuff.

191
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:17,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, I look forward to what you guys are making and I am definitely going to make a world that I will share with all Of you and I want you to play it.

192
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:18,217
Speaker 1: I'm kind of excited.

193
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:21,390
Speaker 0: I'm definitely making some boo Fanto combinations, right?

194
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:22,876
Speaker 0: I don't think there is a Mario.

195
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,868
Speaker 0: get an official Mario game that has that combination in it.

196
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:32,289
Speaker 0: But imagine like you go in a room and you're you can't look left and right because there's booze and there's a key.

197
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,216
Speaker 0: you grab The key and now a phantos coming.

198
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:36,124
Speaker 0: you gotta run but there's booze.

199
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:37,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the phantos coming.

200
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:41,898
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can do that But I put a Fanta in one area.

201
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:43,945
Speaker 1: put a Fanta really far away from the keys.

202
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:45,732
Speaker 1: you pick up the key and nothing happens Nothing.

203
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,198
Speaker 0: I don't know if they you choose.

204
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:50,230
Speaker 0: I'll have to see at the specifics of it which were not revealed.

205
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:54,809
Speaker 0: I don't know if you position the Fanta or you just put a Fanta key and that's it.

206
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:02,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing the thing I'm looking at doesn't even say anything about Fanta Right, so I'm not sure the specifics of how those the things work, which is fine.

207
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:04,922
Speaker 1: All I really needed is the world making.

208
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:09,101
Speaker 1: even if that was the only thing they added I would have been equally jazzed for this release.

209
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,487
Speaker 0: right and the world thing is.

210
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:15,482
Speaker 0: first of all They let you do a full eight worlds with 40 up to 40 total levels.

211
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:22,684
Speaker 0: Yeah in your eight worlds and then On top of that they gave you all the Koopa kids.

212
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:24,290
Speaker 0: so you have bosses to fill your worlds.

213
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,293
Speaker 1: Yeah, actual bosses not just the same like boomer boss at the end of every level Right.

214
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:33,690
Speaker 0: and then on top of that you think about how much fun you're gonna have making your Mario worlds.

215
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:36,344
Speaker 0: However, many you are allowed to make right?

216
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:41,614
Speaker 0: Uh You're gonna get to play worlds Made by other people.

217
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:42,216
Speaker 1: Yep.

218
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:45,486
Speaker 0: This is like, you know, it's not like right now.

219
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:50,326
Speaker 0: you open Mario maker today And by the way, the update comes out tomorrow the 22nd and today's the 21st.

220
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,409
Speaker 0: So probably by the time you listen to this the update will be out.

221
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,784
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can open up Mario maker today and it's like okay play random levels created by other people.

222
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:01,228
Speaker 0: This will now be okay.

223
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,629
Speaker 0: I'm gonna just go play entire Mario games.

224
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:18,610
Speaker 0: Right the amount of content, you know singles used to come out But now we have albums and you just have to tons and tons of albums Like, you know every player will probably have at least one or two that they've made.

225
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

226
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,964
Speaker 0: So you're just like I played a whole Mario world today.

227
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:22,446
Speaker 0: tomorrow.

228
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:23,290
Speaker 0: I'll play a whole different.

229
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:25,433
Speaker 0: It's great.

230
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:26,638
Speaker 1: All right.

231
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:37,045
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's time for the Eggs of the day.

232
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:37,626
Speaker 1: What do you got?

233
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:41,719
Speaker 0: So way back at one kinetic on I forgot what year it was.

234
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:50,890
Speaker 0: friend of the show Constantine von Hoffman did a panel that we accepted and put on the schedule Called the history of dice.

235
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:55,590
Speaker 0: all gamers love dice I think even video gamers who don't play RPGs or any.

236
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,940
Speaker 1: I didn't get to go to this panel because I was the head of Panels and I was dealing with other stuff.

237
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:06,079
Speaker 1: But the feedback I got from that panel that first time it was running kinetic on was a plus feedback.

238
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:07,585
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I went to the panel.

239
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:21,779
Speaker 0: It was a plus s-rank panel even about the history of dice of interest to all all nerds And You know, but there was no video of that panel and there was no way for the general population to see it.

240
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:33,840
Speaker 0: However Constantine was at magfest and did the panel at magfest and Magfest is took videos of all its panels and the video quality of the panels that that magfest recorded was low.

241
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:51,240
Speaker 0: They had like cheapo camcorders right on tripods that were not moving But they were recording audio from the mixer boards in the room And they even though the trip Cameras weren't moving and were pretty low quality and the lighting wasn't great.

242
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:58,569
Speaker 0: they did an okay job of making sure to get the speaker and the Not the audio speaker the person speaking.

243
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:01,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, you and the projector screen in the frame.

244
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:08,920
Speaker 0: So the recordings of the panels while not amazing like not II, you know, like geek nights panel recordings aren't that great?

245
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,485
Speaker 0: But these are not as good as those.

246
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:18,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, but because the audio is good enough to hear and you can see the screen They are very much above the bar where it's like.

247
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:18,752
Speaker 0: Yes.

248
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:21,540
Speaker 0: This is where I'm not gonna like not watch this.

249
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:28,895
Speaker 1: Yeah better than most Conventions videos for panels everywhere on earth for all of time, right?

250
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:30,740
Speaker 0: Exactly the content comes through.

251
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:32,148
Speaker 0: You're not missing anything.

252
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:37,760
Speaker 0: So here is the video of Constantine von Hoffman magfest 2020 the history of dice.

253
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,367
Speaker 1: 5,000 years of the d6 2500 years of the d20.

254
00:18:42,302 --> 00:18:55,120
Speaker 0: Yes, this is a fascinating panel that is worth your 30 minutes of time to watch and learn all about Everything you knew and didn't know about dice the most one of the most important gaming components.

255
00:18:55,804 --> 00:19:04,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, uh my thing of the day This is Tom Scott, which sure you've run into this person on YouTube before just makes generally good videos.

256
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:08,040
Speaker 1: But are you familiar Scott with the concept in our language of a prefix?

257
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:10,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, yep.

258
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:13,863
Speaker 0: It's the part of the word that comes before the yeah The main part of the word.

259
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:16,892
Speaker 0: and how about us like if I said anti rim?

260
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:18,798
Speaker 0: right anti would be a prefix.

261
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,427
Speaker 1: Yep Suffixes are also a thing.

262
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:22,473
Speaker 1: You're really with suffixes.

263
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:23,539
Speaker 1: You can stick stuff at the end.

264
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,187
Speaker 0: Are you familiar with like a rim ism?

265
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:27,351
Speaker 0: ism would be the suffix.

266
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:30,520
Speaker 1: Are you familiar with the concept of an infix?

267
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:35,829
Speaker 0: I can imagine what it means But I can't think of an example of one right now.

268
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:42,873
Speaker 1: that is because with one exception They do not exist in English, but they do exist in other languages.

269
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:45,060
Speaker 0: I imagine German probably has them.

270
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:48,020
Speaker 0: So they're like the kings of combo words.

271
00:19:48,422 --> 00:20:06,448
Speaker 1: This video explains the deal with infixes But the part that's fascinating is that the one exception to the rule where we do use infixes in English The exception is saying Kurt saying bad words like fuck Abso-fucking-lutely is an infix.

272
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:07,793
Speaker 0: Oh, there you go.

273
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:12,745
Speaker 1: That is basically the only time Infixes are used in English.

274
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,640
Speaker 1: like 90% of all English infixes are the word fuck.

275
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:18,928
Speaker 1: And even better.

276
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:20,700
Speaker 1: this video does a really great job.

277
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:28,880
Speaker 1: You know when you're a kid and like middle school and you take Spanish class or French class and you start to learn how English Worked in a way that was never taught to you before.

278
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:35,460
Speaker 1: The cool thing about this video is it points out that I know how to construct the word abso-fucking-lutely.

279
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:38,329
Speaker 1: But why does fuck have to go in that spot?

280
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,299
Speaker 1: Why does abs fuck solutely not work?

281
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,348
Speaker 1: Like why does it have to be abso-fucking-lutely?

282
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:54,612
Speaker 1: this video explains the rule that we all knew and could never explain absolute fuckly.

283
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:59,574
Speaker 1: I Feel like I'm gonna try to affect in my language using infixes with the.

284
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:05,070
Speaker 0: well, okay, so it can't go between The the Lee because the Lee is actually a suffering.

285
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:06,815
Speaker 0: So it's you got absolute.

286
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:08,460
Speaker 0: so it's absolutes.

287
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,100
Speaker 0: So you know they either go between the abs and the so or between the so and the loot.

288
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it could be abso-fucking-lute or abs fucking solute.

289
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:21,116
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the only one of those sounds right Abfuck solutely.

290
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:23,190
Speaker 0: That's not too bad.

291
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,387
Speaker 0: if we're pronounced that way It's obviously not as good as abso-fucking-lute.

292
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:27,748
Speaker 0: Yep.

293
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:31,278
Speaker 1: So this video explains the full deal in less than five minutes.

294
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:31,779
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

295
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,640
Speaker 1: Okay, uh, since we're in the meta moment now, uh, one thing I will point out.

296
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:40,320
Speaker 1: We are obviously not going to be appearing at any conventions for the foreseeable future.

297
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:47,202
Speaker 0: No, even though pecs West today did announce that they are as still on Right.

298
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:49,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, and a lot of people are mad about that.

299
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,125
Speaker 0: understandably if they see an announcement like that and they don't understand The the full deal.

300
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:54,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

301
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:56,534
Speaker 1: We do not have inside knowledge.

302
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:59,349
Speaker 1: Like we're not about to reveal any secrets We know from packs.

303
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:00,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know any secrets.

304
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,883
Speaker 0: However, I just know things in general about conventions and what I know and I'm not a hundred percent sure that this is true But this is just

305
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:16,300
Speaker 1: well I can let's say let's say this we cannot say if this is true or not for packs in particular But it is true of other similar conventions.

306
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:17,405
Speaker 0: Yes, we have.

307
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:30,760
Speaker 0: no we have known this to be true of other large events Right in general and therefore we could presume it might also be true for packs and explain why they are saying they're still on In such a scenario, right?

308
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,420
Speaker 0: So you're having a big ol event, right?

309
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,600
Speaker 0: You have a contract with the with the space that you've already signed yours in advance.

310
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:42,159
Speaker 0: You have contracts with vendors hotels all kinds of people, right?

311
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:52,815
Speaker 0: If you just cancel your event and say yeah, we're not having it then for example The convention center can say well you sign this contract with us your kit.

312
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:53,577
Speaker 0: You just cancel.

313
00:22:53,597 --> 00:22:54,380
Speaker 0: you still to pay us.

314
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,484
Speaker 0: You can't just cancel.

315
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:58,154
Speaker 1: Yep, right maybe the whole amount in many cases.

316
00:22:58,214 --> 00:22:59,138
Speaker 1: It's the full amount.

317
00:22:59,198 --> 00:23:02,668
Speaker 1: in other cases There's a penalty fee that depends on the circumstances.

318
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:03,871
Speaker 0: It gets coming who knows right.

319
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:11,640
Speaker 0: also, for example, the hotel nearby might be like Hey, I was holding some rooms for you that I could have sold you canceled.

320
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:15,640
Speaker 0: I'm gonna sue you to get you know, you made me lose money, right?

321
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:19,211
Speaker 0: And that who knows that that lawsuit would succeed or fail?

322
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,260
Speaker 0: I'm not a lawyer but that could happen, right?

323
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:35,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also you're regardless of whether these sorts of things happen or not Your relationships with some of these other Businesses that are you know where you're working together with for the convention could be harmed if you just cancel.

324
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,012
Speaker 1: now You might think but a global catastrophe like coronavirus?

325
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,560
Speaker 1: shouldn't humans just be able to do the right thing?

326
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,029
Speaker 1: The problem is humans have no say in this.

327
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,820
Speaker 1: it is law and capitalism that has a say, right?

328
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,000
Speaker 0: The contracts have already been signed years in advance.

329
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:52,169
Speaker 0: So the result is the final piece.

330
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,620
Speaker 0: and listen to a previous geek nights episode about insurance, right?

331
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:10,140
Speaker 0: If you are a big convention you have insurance, right and it presumably if you have some insurance to protect your event You know to mitigate the risk of your event not happening, right which is a good insurance to buy if you're holding a large event.

332
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, if we have a big night's that insurance won't pay out if you cancel, right?

333
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,109
Speaker 0: It would only pay out if you are forced to cancel.

334
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:21,780
Speaker 0: like my insurance won't pay if I burn my house down.

335
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:23,679
Speaker 0: It would only pay if my house got burned.

336
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:30,256
Speaker 0: So as a result, right packs cannot say we're canceling right?

337
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,680
Speaker 0: Otherwise, they would be burned.

338
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:34,887
Speaker 1: Because again, we don't know the specifics of packs.

339
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:39,580
Speaker 0: but right and it's even worse we can presume that that might be the case.

340
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:54,543
Speaker 1: It's likely a convention in general can't even say we'd like to cancel but we can't yet because that shows In legal terms effectively bad faith so that later when you do have an excuse to cancel You could still.

341
00:24:54,763 --> 00:25:01,102
Speaker 1: people could still go after you saying ah, you were trying to cancel the whole time to get out of this contract Exactly.

342
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:13,960
Speaker 0: So as a result packs is sort of Possibly, you know, we can assume based on just logic they might be Forced to say that they are still on even though they may.

343
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,050
Speaker 0: the people behind it may be thinking we're not having this, right?

344
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:27,602
Speaker 0: Until such a time as they are forced to for example of Washington State or the city of Seattle said you can't have this packs This year you better move it or cancel it.

345
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:32,430
Speaker 0: then they can say well Pay us or even insurance give us money.

346
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:43,758
Speaker 1: It's usually a lot of the contracts involved have clauses that cover all this stuff Like yep, if the con can't happen for reasons then and basically everybody don't know your money now right exactly so.

347
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,160
Speaker 0: but the

348
00:25:44,562 --> 00:26:00,653
Speaker 1: part capitalism wise is Let's say and generally an event like packs other types of conventions It would often be cheaper for them to run Anyway, say say like it comes to the point where the government doesn't give them an excuse to cancel They're not forced to cancel.

349
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:07,210
Speaker 1: It would probably be cheaper for them to run anyway, even if zero people attend than to cancel.

350
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:12,476
Speaker 0: right, so my My guess and my advice right?

351
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:17,270
Speaker 0: So my guess is that packs West 2020 has a less than 50% chance of happening.

352
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm feeling like one in three shot at best.

353
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:20,962
Speaker 0: Yes.

354
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:29,722
Speaker 0: My advice is that If it gets you know is if you really want to go Especially if you're close why not buy a ticket?

355
00:26:29,743 --> 00:26:31,270
Speaker 0: you get a refund if it cancels, right?

356
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,690
Speaker 1: There could be that I trust packs to give me refunds more than I trust pretty much any other goddamn con.

357
00:26:37,252 --> 00:26:45,150
Speaker 0: Right, if you're buying plane, you know, I can always cancel hotel and get a refund on the tickets But the plane tickets if you want to fly to it might be a problem.

358
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:50,250
Speaker 0: So make sure if you are buying plane tickets to packs who has 2020 to get refundable one?

359
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:55,242
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not gonna be If packs West looks like it's still gonna happen and we get to August.

360
00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:57,390
Speaker 1: I'm still not buying my tickets until right before.

361
00:26:57,812 --> 00:27:00,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, my plan is if it actually happens.

362
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:01,749
Speaker 0: Will I go?

363
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:02,951
Speaker 0: Maybe?

364
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,059
Speaker 1: yep depends on a lot of factors.

365
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,030
Speaker 1: It depends on a lot depending on how things go.

366
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:20,195
Speaker 1: It's not out of the realm that we could go to packs Australia, but not to packs Wes like, you know it might be bad because considering the fact that Like the u.s.

367
00:27:20,236 --> 00:27:26,041
Speaker 1: Might be a situation where like u.s Cons are all canceled, but the rest of the world starts to have conventions again, right?

368
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,709
Speaker 0: Right if Australia lets us go there, right?

369
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:38,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've got vacation days piled up right this this storm could be a resulting in us You know going to packs Australia in October.

370
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,290
Speaker 1: Yep, but not going to any other taxes because they may or may not happen.

371
00:27:42,812 --> 00:27:52,430
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens with yep, which would be fine because I've been to two packs Australia's Threatened to return someday and maybe I'll have to make good on that threat cuz you have a lot.

372
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,841
Speaker 0: Australia ever fix their fire situation.

373
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:56,870
Speaker 1: Yeah that that that got better.

374
00:27:57,673 --> 00:27:59,178
Speaker 1: Okay, not saying everything's great.

375
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:01,466
Speaker 1: But that that situation is not the immediate crisis.

376
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:02,269
Speaker 0: I was pretty bad.

377
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:03,913
Speaker 1: Well, I was.

378
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:04,615
Speaker 1: that was worse.

379
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:10,846
Speaker 1: I was in Sydney and Melbourne during the height of that and Sydney was so bad I could barely breathe just in the street.

380
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:14,398
Speaker 0: All right, anyway, yeah Luigi's Mansion.

381
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:21,850
Speaker 1: so Luigi's Mansion is part of the Luigi video game series Which started with Luigi's hammer toss in?

382
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,893
Speaker 1: 1990.

383
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:24,379
Speaker 0: I never heard of that game.

384
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:24,781
Speaker 1: Yep.

385
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:26,127
Speaker 1: Mario is missing.

386
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:27,191
Speaker 1: Luigi's I'm aware of.

387
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:30,564
Speaker 1: that game was the third Luigi game in 2001 on the game of cube.

388
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:38,093
Speaker 0: Yeah So I played the GameCube one as soon as it came out because I bought a GameCube on release day and that was the launch Title on the GameCube.

389
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:38,273
Speaker 0: Yep.

390
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:41,282
Speaker 1: I remember I drove Scott to pick up his launch day.

391
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,770
Speaker 1: GameCube at the media play, right?

392
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,367
Speaker 0: So the original Luigi's man, I didn't play the second Luigi's Mansion, which I think was a dark 3ds game.

393
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:50,003
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't play any of those.

394
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:51,953
Speaker 1: I didn't One.

395
00:28:52,074 --> 00:28:54,082
Speaker 1: I watched Scott play most of it.

396
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:55,367
Speaker 1: That's how I know about.

397
00:28:55,407 --> 00:29:05,510
Speaker 0: mentioned one was basically It was sort of you know, it was a game where you walk around the mansion and you basically touch everything, right?

398
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,470
Speaker 0: So it's like it's just almost like a funhouse right which is fitting for a haunted mansion, right?

399
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:14,850
Speaker 0: You know you go around and you interact with all the bits that you can interact with right?

400
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,778
Speaker 0: There was a painting on the wall, right?

401
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:17,964
Speaker 0: There's a there's a desk.

402
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:19,934
Speaker 0: There's a bed There's a right.

403
00:29:19,954 --> 00:29:22,970
Speaker 0: this stuff and everything sort of does something.

404
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not often a super game mechanic II thing, but just like it'll react in some way.

405
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:31,541
Speaker 0: That's mildly amusing Right, or you know, sometimes you just push a to open a drawer.

406
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:39,950
Speaker 0: Sometimes you vacuum something off the wall Because Luigi has his vacuum and then this is intermittently dispersed with combat.

407
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:46,650
Speaker 0: Well combat with with ghosts booze of sorts, right and all of general regard, right?

408
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,413
Speaker 0: They're they're sort of a combination of a puzzle Right of like.

409
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:51,637
Speaker 0: how do I get this guy?

410
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:54,870
Speaker 0: and also a little bit of action gamepad fitness?

411
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,442
Speaker 0: You gotta think much like you do not have very easy, right?

412
00:29:58,542 --> 00:29:59,125
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

413
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:00,470
Speaker 0: I have to get this guy from behind.

414
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:03,466
Speaker 0: Okay, I have to distract this guy and then get him right.

415
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:07,470
Speaker 0: this, you know It's just a little bit of something something strategy for each of the ghosts.

416
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:09,150
Speaker 0: Some of them are harder easier than others.

417
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,330
Speaker 1: This is why I got bored with the original Luigi's Mansion pretty quick.

418
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,855
Speaker 1: I didn't actually play be.

419
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,464
Speaker 1: I played like an hour of it and I was done right.

420
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:24,430
Speaker 0: and then as you go on You know your you as you catch more ghosts more of the mansion unlocks, right?

421
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:30,830
Speaker 0: So you're going you know to higher floors in the mansion exploring more rooms and eventually there's a boss and the games over.

422
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:37,650
Speaker 0: So I didn't play Luigi's Mansion - right but Luigi's Mansion 3 came out for the switch and I figured why not?

423
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:42,178
Speaker 0: I go what else I have to do and It's pretty much the same genre of game.

424
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:42,399
Speaker 0: right?

425
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:55,590
Speaker 0: you walk around this this mansion, which is actually a hotel now haunted hotel And you can interact with all the different things in the hotel and as you go on you catch ghosts with some minor little action gameplay up.

426
00:30:57,973 --> 00:31:00,662
Speaker 0: They give you though a lot more ways to interact right.

427
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:02,970
Speaker 0: there's not just the vacuum and the flashlight and the.

428
00:31:04,135 --> 00:31:14,788
Speaker 0: You know Luigi pressing a. You can say Mario sure You can You can you know, the vacuum sucks in and out.

429
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:19,070
Speaker 0: You can do sort of a radius poof with it with the vacuum.

430
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:21,380
Speaker 1: So there's a lot more like kind of almost

431
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:21,782
Speaker 0: physics

432
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:24,854
Speaker 1: puzzles in a lot of the game Like they're not

433
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:28,289
Speaker 0: quite physics puzzles like order of operations puzzles

434
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:30,075
Speaker 1: Yeah, or it's like,

435
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:33,671
Speaker 0: oh I have to do this to that then do this to that Yeah,

436
00:31:33,952 --> 00:31:35,397
Speaker 1: or like I see a thing in the rafters.

437
00:31:35,498 --> 00:31:39,150
Speaker 1: How could I Russell the rafters Jimmy's cuz that'll probably knock it down.

438
00:31:39,392 --> 00:31:41,790
Speaker 0: Oh, I know I have to suck this thing into the vacuum.

439
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:48,050
Speaker 0: It'll get stuck on the front and then I'll shoot it out reverse the vacuum to shoot it like a projectile, right?

440
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:57,389
Speaker 1: Yep, and you basically go around just fussing with stuff and seeing funny animations and getting little cutscenes and sort of just exploring This mansion for several hours.

441
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:05,294
Speaker 0: right now the key thing that they've added here in Luigi's Mansion 3 is Gooigi which The fiction of it.

442
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:19,910
Speaker 0: It appears that your soul inhabits this thing and leaves your body Right, so you could play a two-player Co-op sort of situation where someone else is Gooigi right and you're Luigi.

443
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:31,484
Speaker 0: But normal single-player gameplay you just switch between the two right and the deal with Gooigi is he's like another Luigi But he has additional powers to because he's made of goo.

444
00:32:31,704 --> 00:32:34,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you can walk through spikes He could walk through spikes.

445
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,750
Speaker 0: He could walk through the bars of a jail cell.

446
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,541
Speaker 0: He could go through a plumbing and come out the other end.

447
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if he touches water, that's it.

448
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:41,950
Speaker 0: No good.

449
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:52,580
Speaker 0: And so you have to move Luigi and Gooigi in concert with each other switching back and forth To sort of puzzle your way through different areas.

450
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:59,480
Speaker 0: and it's that puzzle element really is the additional thing that Luigi's Mansion 1 didn't have too much of

451
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:10,800
Speaker 1: yep, and it gave me enough meat to where unlike Luigi's Mansion 1 Where I got bored within about an hour just didn't play anymore because it started to feel more and more samey Luigi's Mansion 3 is keeping my attention.

452
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:12,527
Speaker 1: I'm gonna beat it soon.

453
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:13,150
Speaker 1: I'm near the end.

454
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,739
Speaker 1: I haven't beaten it yet just because other games came out.

455
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:21,018
Speaker 0: Well, not only is it the puzzle aspect of Gooigi Right and his incorporation.

456
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,022
Speaker 0: There's also.

457
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:23,830
Speaker 0: the game is just bigger because it's on the switch.

458
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,734
Speaker 0: It's not an in cube.

459
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,725
Speaker 0: you're going this huge hotel with tons of floors.

460
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:28,910
Speaker 0: All the floors are unique.

461
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:31,017
Speaker 0: There's backtracking to different floors.

462
00:33:31,037 --> 00:33:31,719
Speaker 0: You have to do.

463
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,168
Speaker 0: there's a lot of secrets to find on each floor, right?

464
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:36,936
Speaker 0: There's like a boo radar.

465
00:33:36,956 --> 00:33:40,090
Speaker 0: you get to like, oh, okay you cleared out that floor, that's great.

466
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:42,002
Speaker 0: But did you know there's a boo hiding on that floor?

467
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:43,089
Speaker 0: Do you want to go back and get it?

468
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,010
Speaker 0: It's hiding somewhere.

469
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,229
Speaker 0: You're gonna have to use follow solve a clever puzzle.

470
00:33:46,712 --> 00:33:51,901
Speaker 0: Even though you found the boo you might not be able to catch it until you figure out how to make it come out of Its shell or whatever.

471
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:54,835
Speaker 0: It's in right You know, it's like.

472
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:57,370
Speaker 0: oh I had to find the hidden thing behind the whatever.

473
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:03,330
Speaker 1: Yep And there's just the right amount of those kinds of secrets kind of like the new Mario Brothers kind of like Breath of the Wild.

474
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:16,909
Speaker 1: Nintendo's really been on a kick lately of having a Density of things to find without necessarily expecting you to find all the things just to make sure that the density is sufficient To where pretty much anywhere you go poking around you'll find something interesting.

475
00:34:17,692 --> 00:34:23,810
Speaker 0: Well, also the game, you know Luigi is trying to collect I guess money just generally right and there's basically money everywhere.

476
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:24,850
Speaker 0: Yeah constantly.

477
00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:33,742
Speaker 0: So that money is sort of what gives you that Psychological Reward impulse for interacting with every single thing in the game.

478
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:34,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you might.

479
00:34:34,826 --> 00:34:41,900
Speaker 0: just normally it's like, okay I only need to catch the boss ghost to beat this floor and get the Elevator button to go to the next floor, right?

480
00:34:42,183 --> 00:34:43,469
Speaker 0: I'll just run straight at the boss.

481
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:45,216
Speaker 0: So you run past a bunch of stuff.

482
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:45,899
Speaker 0: you could do that.

483
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:46,702
Speaker 0: Nothing's stopping you.

484
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:48,609
Speaker 0: I'm sure speedrunners will do exactly that.

485
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:53,125
Speaker 0: But a normal casual player goes down the hallway and there's ten paintings.

486
00:34:53,165 --> 00:34:57,403
Speaker 0: They're vacuuming every painting Flashing their flashlight at every painting especially kids.

487
00:34:57,685 --> 00:34:58,830
Speaker 1: this game like I like it.

488
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,255
Speaker 1: Okay, like it's a pretty good game.

489
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:04,450
Speaker 1: Like it's just worth playing but this game is definitely aimed at kids.

490
00:35:04,591 --> 00:35:11,603
Speaker 1: I can imagine me as a kid and other kids I've known Vacuuming up every goddamn dollar in that entire hotel.

491
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:13,129
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, right.

492
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:15,114
Speaker 0: So that's a ton of fun.

493
00:35:15,194 --> 00:35:23,423
Speaker 0: And the other thing about this is that you know, Luigi's Mansion 1, you know Thematically speaking it was kind of samey, right?

494
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:28,823
Speaker 0: I mean there were different rooms with slightly different themes But it was really capture ten different general beauregard's.

495
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:30,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, right?

496
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:38,061
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, but this one every floor of the hotel is Dramatically different right some of them are.

497
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:39,850
Speaker 0: it's like how is this even a hotel floor?

498
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:46,062
Speaker 0: Right and each hotel floor is almost like its own game with two tells its own story Right and has its own boss.

499
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,149
Speaker 0: that fits with that story.

500
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:54,476
Speaker 1: And like the radical difference like the moment when I realized this game was actually big was when I got to the like pretty early On you get to the medieval floor.

501
00:35:54,496 --> 00:36:03,450
Speaker 1: the medieval floor is the biggest craziest one so far Yeah, but it's so big and different from everything you've seen in the game up to that point, right?

502
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,553
Speaker 0: There's the medieval floor.

503
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:09,270
Speaker 0: then there's like this floor where there's a movie directing ghost and you have to go to the different scenes.

504
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,219
Speaker 0: they're directing a whole new mic.

505
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,290
Speaker 0: that floor has its own mechanic of Having to look through the camera.

506
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:22,168
Speaker 0: Right while one Luigi looks through the camera and the other one acts out the scenes in front of the camera.

507
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:23,514
Speaker 0: and when you look Through the camera you're.

508
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:25,182
Speaker 0: it's like when you're not looking through the camera.

509
00:36:25,223 --> 00:36:26,690
Speaker 0: all you see is a movie set now.

510
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:31,108
Speaker 0: But when you look through the camera, you see the actual movie as it would look to the.

511
00:36:31,128 --> 00:36:35,401
Speaker 0: you know Concept pot, you know, whoever would be watching it in the theater,

512
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:35,963
Speaker 1: right

513
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:50,424
Speaker 0: and you have to combine You know adjusting the movie set with also You know doing things in the movie to solve the puzzle of the room and you have to solve all the rooms Right, and then you know, there's the floor the Egyptian floor where you go in.

514
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:57,829
Speaker 0: It's just a big room full of sand Right and that floor is like, you know a crazy pyramid puzzle right as you right.

515
00:36:58,553 --> 00:37:01,205
Speaker 0: But it's also there's a sand mechanic on that floor.

516
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:12,237
Speaker 0: So it's like Not only is each floor thematically different But they're also mechanically different each one of them introducing a new Twist on on how the game works.

517
00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:16,628
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that even though you've already learned all of Luigi's abilities They've given him.

518
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:25,790
Speaker 0: You know the first few floors that you gain all your abilities your vacuum and your flashlight and you know, everything you're gooey G. Yeah, like okay, you've got all the abilities.

519
00:37:26,091 --> 00:37:28,139
Speaker 0: We're gonna make you do something new with them every time.

520
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,151
Speaker 1: and that's where this game shines where the original illusion that you just couldn't Get me.

521
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:34,423
Speaker 1: there's enough variety of stuff to do to where I don't get bored.

522
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:39,255
Speaker 1: as soon as I have to capture a ghost the Same way multiple times in a game like this I'm definitely gonna get bored.

523
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:46,444
Speaker 1: but this game just keeps changing things up enough to where Despite having like doom eternal and all these other games to play.

524
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:50,064
Speaker 1: I'm finishing Luigi's Mansion something I didn't really expect to do that quickly.

525
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:52,765
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm But yeah it.

526
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:54,193
Speaker 0: uh, you know It definitely keeps thing.

527
00:37:54,294 --> 00:38:03,209
Speaker 0: it keeps your interest on each floor as you ascend and then you beat it and you beat it and then You're good, you know, you could play it again and try to give be a completionist about it.

528
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,615
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't think that's.

529
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:05,961
Speaker 1: I would not would not do that.

530
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:11,141
Speaker 0: if you're if you're the person who likes Completing things like hundred percent and collect all the stuff.

531
00:38:11,562 --> 00:38:13,208
Speaker 0: Why don't you just play Animal Crossing instead?

532
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,700
Speaker 0: That's all you do Is collect all the stuff.

533
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,789
Speaker 0: that seems like a better choice?

534
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:19,998
Speaker 0: You know Luigi's Mansion definitely were.

535
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:27,890
Speaker 0: if you have the time and you have the money and maybe it'll go It'll probably is the kind of game that Nintendo will actually put on sale for less than the full price at some point.

536
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:29,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could wait.

537
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,809
Speaker 1: Oh, this game's not going anywhere.

538
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, or you could buy the cartridge play and then sell it to your friend or something like that.

539
00:38:34,806 --> 00:38:39,649
Speaker 0: It's a good pro move Yeah, but yeah, it's definitely worth playing through once and being done with.

540
00:38:40,711 --> 00:38:49,797
Speaker 0: you know not like the all-time greatest game, but definitely, you know, pretty interesting and You know better than the first Luigi's Mansion.

541
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:52,585
Speaker 1: It is also the the first way she's matching like I just I was.

542
00:38:53,287 --> 00:39:00,010
Speaker 1: it looked so Repetitive when I saw you playing it that I just I lost interest before I even got to the repetitive part.

543
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:06,159
Speaker 0: yeah, Luigi's Mansion 1 definitely had some of the Repetition of like, you know catch 10 booze.

544
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:08,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least that's you know, it's been so long, right?

545
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,416
Speaker 0: That's just my could be my faulty memory.

546
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:11,400
Speaker 1: That's all I remember.

547
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,230
Speaker 1: is you chasing down multiple general boo regards?

548
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:15,539
Speaker 0: It did feel it.

549
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,970
Speaker 0: There's only one general boo regard.

550
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:18,575
Speaker 0: It does feel like you're.

551
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:25,919
Speaker 0: you're going around and getting you know, a lot of dudes where the booze all in names But they all were the same.

552
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,726
Speaker 1: like there was no actual difference between.

553
00:39:27,746 --> 00:39:31,803
Speaker 0: there was some difference But it's definitely the different boot.

554
00:39:31,823 --> 00:39:38,999
Speaker 0: the bosses in Just mentioned three are drastically different Different games.

555
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:46,430
Speaker 1: the way you capture and defeat ghosts Involves a surprising amount of ultra violence inflicted upon these ghosts.

556
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:51,997
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you suck them and then you sort of that's a slam them back and forth And then you lose enough hit.

557
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:54,509
Speaker 0: once they lose enough hit points then you can get them.

558
00:39:55,311 --> 00:40:01,350
Speaker 1: So I guess after a four-year hiatus, this is a a good addition to the Luigi series of games.

559
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,230
Speaker 1: There's a whole Wikipedia page about the Luigi series.

560
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:15,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll be waiting quite a while for the next one because the last one was Luigi's Mansion arcade in 2015 Which never made it to the US for probably obvious reasons and before that pictures of that It's.

561
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:20,025
Speaker 0: it looks like one of those, you know, sit-down rail kind of shootery thing else.

562
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:28,680
Speaker 1: There was what I remember Luigi, which you never played because it was on the Wii U. There isn't even a screenshot of dr.

563
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,828
Speaker 1: Luigi on the Wikipedia page about dr.

564
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:31,290
Speaker 1: Luigi.

565
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:33,492
Speaker 1: Dr.

566
00:40:33,512 --> 00:40:35,700
Speaker 1: Luigi and bacteria eradication.

567
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:36,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was right.

568
00:40:36,663 --> 00:40:41,124
Speaker 0: Luigi's Mansion arcade was a Rail shooter situation where you you know, you just sit there.

569
00:40:41,164 --> 00:40:42,270
Speaker 0: It's like a little vacuum in there.

570
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:47,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just sort of sit on the seat and then vacuum ghosts on while you're on rails, right?

571
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:56,202
Speaker 1: Yeah I remember way back when I was younger and more naive I was interested in all those Nintendo arcade systems that you could never get a hold of and never see.

572
00:40:56,222 --> 00:41:02,490
Speaker 1: the f-zero one is really the f-zero one was the only Good one because even like the Mario Kart one was not actually good when I played it.

573
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:10,528
Speaker 0: No, no, the Mario Kart one has a lot of interesting features But they didn't give it the the important feature of making it actually a competitive racing game.

574
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:17,012
Speaker 0: Yeah Right, whereas initial D lets you hold down the button to turn off the catch-up Mechanism.

575
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:22,369
Speaker 1: Yep, which I invariably will do and then someone beats me by like a mile because they're good.

576
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:22,830
Speaker 0: That's all right.

577
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,593
Speaker 0: I'd rather lose.

578
00:41:23,613 --> 00:41:28,188
Speaker 0: I'd rather lose that way lose by one second because I got boosts.

579
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:28,710
Speaker 1: Yep.

580
00:41:29,493 --> 00:41:36,823
Speaker 1: So yeah, if you're really if you've never played Luigi's Mansion game And this sounds that all interesting get this one.

581
00:41:36,944 --> 00:41:38,290
Speaker 1: Don't bother with any that came before.

582
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,101
Speaker 1: This is the best one like by far.

583
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,571
Speaker 0: if you have what it is It's.

584
00:41:42,273 --> 00:41:46,310
Speaker 0: there's their games that are like, you know, you buy the switch for the game, right?

585
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,719
Speaker 0: You could buy a switch for breath of the wild.

586
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,430
Speaker 0: Yep, you could buy a switch for Mario maker, too.

587
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:57,250
Speaker 0: Right, you could borrow spy switch for Animal Crossing buying a switch for Luigi's Mansion 3.

588
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,384
Speaker 0: They're not buying a switch to play Luigi's Mansion 3, but it's rich.

589
00:42:02,247 --> 00:42:05,058
Speaker 0: if you got a switch Why not get Luigi's credit?

590
00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:07,086
Speaker 1: It's basically impossible to get switches now.

591
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:08,210
Speaker 1: They're sold out everywhere.

592
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:10,901
Speaker 0: Well, you're gonna be able to get one eventually.

593
00:42:11,002 --> 00:42:12,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't have one now.

594
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:18,709
Speaker 1: So if you already got a switch like you're probably bored and you have free time During the quarantine and everything.

595
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:24,769
Speaker 1: So like Scott said buy this on a cartridge because you will trivially be able to resell it or give it to someone later.

596
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:41,143
Speaker 0: Also, I got to say I personally predict based on no information other than hunches and experience There will probably be some sort of like switch plus new switch switch upgrade Thing in the near ish future next year year after.

597
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:43,995
Speaker 1: so I could see that I'd say within two years Definitely.

598
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:45,145
Speaker 0: Yeah something like right.

599
00:42:45,185 --> 00:42:51,293
Speaker 0: so I would If you don't have a switch right now, and you're not desperate to play these games right now Yep, hold out.

600
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:55,733
Speaker 0: I would hold if you can hold out, you know, you got enough PC games I mean one.

601
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,685
Speaker 1: I'm curious what your deal was because breath of the wild was the.

602
00:42:58,805 --> 00:42:59,930
Speaker 1: everyone must buy a switch.

603
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:09,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why you didn't buy a switch when it came out But if you know down we are on console exclusives like don't buy an Xbox just to play one game.

604
00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:10,896
Speaker 1: But seriously breath of the wild.

605
00:43:11,538 --> 00:43:14,007
Speaker 1: if that was the only game I had ever played on my switch.

606
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:14,829
Speaker 1: It was worth the money.

607
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,581
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and you're gonna get a new breath of the wild.

608
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:18,143
Speaker 1: that's coming.

609
00:43:19,107 --> 00:43:22,319
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's right Yeah, and Metroid Prime 4 is coming eventually.

610
00:43:22,379 --> 00:43:24,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm excited about all these games with the switch.

611
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:28,761
Speaker 1: is The best console to have come out since the GameCube?

612
00:43:29,183 --> 00:43:30,669
Speaker 1: across the board like hands down?

613
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,114
Speaker 0: Sure, yeah.

614
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:35,001
Speaker 1: All right, then we killed enough time.

615
00:43:35,222 --> 00:43:37,450
Speaker 1: There's not that much to say about a Luigi's Mansion.

616
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,456
Speaker 1: No, that's why we got a little short here.

617
00:43:39,476 --> 00:43:46,010
Speaker 1: cuz the the short of talking about individual bosses Which no none of you can't just go experience.

618
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:51,070
Speaker 0: I do have to say if you want to err that the floor it was a disappointment on the the museum floor.

619
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,930
Speaker 0: It was a very short floor after having those other floors before it that were longer and more involved.

620
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,796
Speaker 0: Experiences.

621
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:58,810
Speaker 0: that floor it was done in like two seconds.

622
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:01,100
Speaker 1: It felt a little bit like castle crashers.

623
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,646
Speaker 1: Once you got past the first three levels.

624
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:03,530
Speaker 1: You're like, wait a minute.

625
00:44:03,973 --> 00:44:06,210
Speaker 1: These aren't that unique anymore.

626
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no, it's it was good.

627
00:44:08,842 --> 00:44:09,063
Speaker 0: Yeah.

628
00:44:09,768 --> 00:44:10,029
