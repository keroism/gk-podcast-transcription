1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,576
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday April 18.

2
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:13,081
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:15,870
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:20,930
Speaker 1: Tonight we review the first volume of the awesome comic DMZ.

5
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,347
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:28,269
Speaker 0: So I'm sure you all noticed that there was no show yesterday.

7
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:34,608
Speaker 0: Emily was kind enough to take me out to see Avenue Q Which I'd wanted to see for a long time and I finally got to see it.

8
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:41,096
Speaker 1: I stayed home and went to sleep because I hadn't slept enough, and I was falling asleep at work And today I didn't fall asleep.

9
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:44,008
Speaker 0: It was so you had enough time to get plenty of sleep.

10
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,999
Speaker 0: in fact We went to bed fairly early the night before.

11
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:47,721
Speaker 1: no he didn't.

12
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:48,604
Speaker 0: yeah, we did.

13
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:50,731
Speaker 0: we were done with the show by 11.

14
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:53,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, meanwhile before we were getting done with the show at 10 now.

15
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:55,045
Speaker 1: We're starting the show at 930.

16
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:55,427
Speaker 1: It's not good.

17
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:58,638
Speaker 1: I don't like this business.

18
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:04,296
Speaker 1: We gotta start the show earlier, but yeah Part of the sleeping late does have to do with Pokemons.

19
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:14,490
Speaker 0: see Despite the fact that you seem to be staying up late playing this Pokemon And I'm not my pokemons are all higher level than your pokemons cuz you're a Bulbasaur which gets more levels easily.

20
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:16,075
Speaker 0: I don't even use the Bulbasaur.

21
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:18,965
Speaker 0: It's all Pidgeotto or now Pidgeot.

22
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:22,176
Speaker 1: So you got two pokemons I'm leveling up like seven Pokemon.

23
00:01:22,196 --> 00:01:24,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what all my main Pokemon are at least level 30.

24
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:28,321
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, we'll see.

25
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,730
Speaker 0: why don't we have a Pokemon battle?

26
00:01:30,313 --> 00:01:36,389
Speaker 1: Maybe we will one day when I have the Pokemon I want and not the Pokemon I'm forced to have out of necessity of not being done with the game yet.

27
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:43,550
Speaker 0: But yeah, Avenue Q was absolutely hilarious, and I highly recommend that all of you go see it while it's still playing.

28
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:48,089
Speaker 0: I imagine it'll play for a while yet since Apparently Emily got the last two tickets.

29
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know plays are sort of like as long as they keep playing.

30
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:54,250
Speaker 1: They're probably worth seeing.

31
00:01:55,291 --> 00:02:00,390
Speaker 0: Unlike movies which you know that doesn't really work because that they always play at least a couple nights.

32
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,040
Speaker 0: So it kept playing those nights.

33
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:03,670
Speaker 0: It doesn't mean it was worthwhile.

34
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:10,848
Speaker 1: Well, it seems to be that like a play is so expensive to put on that like as soon as you stop selling out You can't afford to keep putting on the show.

35
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:19,628
Speaker 1: So as long as a show's been going for a long time or it's still going or if all the tickets keep selling out And you manage to get some it's probably worth seeing.

36
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:22,882
Speaker 0: well The thing is Avenue Q is weird because it's kind of that Muppet thing.

37
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:28,281
Speaker 0: so it's all actors on stage But they're holding puppets and the puppets are the actual characters.

38
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:31,270
Speaker 0: the actors are just people in gray pants and gray shirts.

39
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,012
Speaker 0: You're supposed to ignore it.

40
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:32,414
Speaker 0: You know what?

41
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:35,303
Speaker 0: after about 30 seconds you totally forget.

42
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:35,745
Speaker 0: They're there.

43
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:36,527
Speaker 0: It's kind of weird.

44
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,797
Speaker 0: wow It really is.

45
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:43,661
Speaker 0: you'll watch like all right, so there's that guy and then by the end You just you suddenly realize that wait a minute.

46
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:44,666
Speaker 0: There's a guy there.

47
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:47,268
Speaker 0: whoa What's that guy doing there?

48
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:54,088
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen videos of it online And I've always paid attention to the guy, but I didn't never went to see the things.

49
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:54,590
Speaker 0: seen it live.

50
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:55,807
Speaker 0: You don't pay attention to the guy.

51
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:56,813
Speaker 1: We'll see.

52
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:58,118
Speaker 1: maybe I will pay attention to the guy.

53
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:02,000
Speaker 1: I tend to have a problem going to see plays that I always Tried this.

54
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:02,770
Speaker 1: I do the same thing.

55
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:10,570
Speaker 1: I do like a magic show where I try to look on purpose where I'm not supposed to look and it ends up actually Giving me the wrong experience.

56
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:12,075
Speaker 0: But so what?

57
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:19,739
Speaker 0: yet ed lame is yet see the guy at the edge of the stage after he gets off the spinny bit like take his wig off and yeah pretty much and I got.

58
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:25,268
Speaker 1: look at the spinny turntable like just to see how it works and like Look for a guy controlling it.

59
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:29,610
Speaker 1: We're not like a guy enters and leaves stage or is like these guys in the corners.

60
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,270
Speaker 1: I'll always look always to the sides and every door is supposed to be looking or like when people are dancing.

61
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,646
Speaker 1: I got look at their feet to see what's going on.

62
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,129
Speaker 1: one thing

63
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:48,185
Speaker 0: I always do because I always tend to sit kind of high up or in balconies or whatever as I always look and try to See if I can point out all the little stage marks like where so-and-so is supposed to stand or where the smokes gonna Explode or whatever's gonna happen.

64
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:52,210
Speaker 1: Yeah It's sort of a bad thing like looking at the end of a book or something.

65
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:54,626
Speaker 1: Maybe I shouldn't do it anymore, but I can't really help myself.

66
00:03:54,646 --> 00:04:04,050
Speaker 0: when I was young I used to have a thing with books where whenever I got a new book I would always flip to the second to last page read a random sentence one sentence and stop right there.

67
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,987
Speaker 0: I just keep that in my mind throughout the whole thing.

68
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:08,077
Speaker 1: Why what's the point?

69
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:08,519
Speaker 0: I don't know.

70
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,530
Speaker 0: It just it gave me a perspective.

71
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:19,732
Speaker 0: I guess sometimes sometimes the sentence wasn't really relevant and that was the end and so it stood and so low.

72
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:28,510
Speaker 0: All right, of course that's a lot better than Ava where I saw interview van galleon before I knew there even was a TV show.

73
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:37,850
Speaker 0: Well, that made it a little bit different to watch a little bit not much So in the news and this ties very much into my thing of the day.

74
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:40,847
Speaker 0: But there's a show out there called Hokuto no.

75
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:43,778
Speaker 0: Ken Aka fist of the North Star.

76
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,824
Speaker 1: anime world order likes to show a lot.

77
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,249
Speaker 1: It's a really old show from the 80s.

78
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:49,178
Speaker 0: I have my opinions about it.

79
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:54,649
Speaker 0: I'll leave that as it may but it's a generally Surprisingly popular show at least outside the US.

80
00:04:54,951 --> 00:05:00,267
Speaker 0: It is very popular in the US not so much and you can't deny that it is in many ways an important show.

81
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:18,547
Speaker 0: However today some 3,000 people Attended a real-life acted-out funeral for a character from the new fist of the North Star movie Entitled true savior legend fist of the North Star the legend of Rao fierce fighting arc.

82
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:21,429
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah, quite the name.

83
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,950
Speaker 0: Now they're doing this straight up.

84
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:36,859
Speaker 0: It looks like it's going to be a traditional Buddhist send-off or a traditional beauty Buddhist funeral and they've got To represent the family of this character who I guess dies in this movie is none other than baron-san

85
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:45,507
Speaker 1: way to way to spoil the movie for people who haven't gone to see it by Having a funeral for a character who dies in it.

86
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, well apparently 3,000 people showed up in the bitter cold to stand there and pay their respects to this guy.

87
00:05:51,548 --> 00:06:02,890
Speaker 0: Wow the legend of Rao fierce fighting arc to quote anime news network is the Third in a five-part series is the conclusion of the Rao saga and features, huh?

88
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,769
Speaker 0: It features the epic battle between Kenshiro the main character and Rao.

89
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:16,150
Speaker 1: Yes, I never would have suspected It's a total shocker right there, you know a Jurassic Park has dinosaurs.

90
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:19,678
Speaker 0: You know someone's ruined Titanic for me.

91
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:21,504
Speaker 0: Apparently that boat sinks.

92
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:22,507
Speaker 1: Oh god.

93
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:23,009
Speaker 1: Oh god.

94
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:26,428
Speaker 1: So in Pearl Harbor the Japanese?

95
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:30,557
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, but fist of the North Star.

96
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:39,710
Speaker 0: a lot of people have mixed feelings about it and as far as I can gather all the Show is is a bunch of muscly men who there's ostensibly a plot, but that doesn't matter.

97
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:44,769
Speaker 0: They yell at each other and Kenshiro stands there clowering and then he'll go.

98
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:50,066
Speaker 0: The guy will say that didn't hurt.

99
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:53,276
Speaker 0: then Kenshiro will say you're already dead.

100
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:54,559
Speaker 0: then the guy will go, huh?

101
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:58,910
Speaker 0: And his head will explode to dramatic music.

102
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:00,656
Speaker 1: That's pretty much the show right?

103
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:01,178
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

104
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:07,980
Speaker 1: That's the whole show Yeah, and apparently people love that so much that they'll go to a funeral for a fictional person.

105
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,286
Speaker 0: I will admit that I have had a lot of fun.

106
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:13,073
Speaker 0: Just randomly watching fight scenes from it on YouTube lately.

107
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:13,514
Speaker 0: Yeah.

108
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:15,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's.

109
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:28,462
Speaker 1: It's something about it where you watch it and it's so dumb, but then the guy goes And Some head explodes and that in and of itself is hilarious and you can watch it a thousand times Plus.

110
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:31,355
Speaker 0: this guy has bigger eyebrows than Bell dandy used to.

111
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:38,160
Speaker 0: oh Ha ha I went bigger than rim used to oh, oh, I don't think his eyebrows are really a match for mine.

112
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:51,629
Speaker 0: You see much like the characters and various shows like Dragon Ball who will somehow limit their power I pluck the middle of my eyebrow solely to prevent it from being so powerful that would in fact rule the world and Overpower lesser men's minds.

113
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,038
Speaker 1: I'll just say Burton Ernie.

114
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:56,607
Speaker 0: then Yeah, yeah, so there's.

115
00:07:56,628 --> 00:08:00,340
Speaker 0: there's a gay Burt in Avenue Q if you haven't seen it great.

116
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:04,880
Speaker 1: So I got a news here and this news is so insignificant that no one cares.

117
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:20,168
Speaker 1: the odds of anyone listening to the show having already known this news are pretty small unless you go to Temple University in Philly, which I don't think anyone does but I'm gonna give you this news Anyway, because it will prompt much discussion.

118
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:21,050
Speaker 1: Are you ready for this?

119
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:21,893
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

120
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:24,159
Speaker 0: Scott refused to tell me what this was earlier.

121
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:25,585
Speaker 0: We were doing pre-production.

122
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,950
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna be surprised by this.

123
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:27,452
Speaker 0: I assume.

124
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:33,453
Speaker 1: Yes the temple university Is having student government elections at some point in the near future.

125
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:47,380
Speaker 1: All right, I Have stories about our it's student government elections, but that'll be a Thursday Yep, and then we're gonna have an event at some point Where some of the student government people are gonna give speeches or whatever?

126
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,142
Speaker 1: Something.

127
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:53,900
Speaker 1: and generally people as people are to student government things are apathetic and don't care whatever.

128
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:55,886
Speaker 0: So we're any cockboats involved.

129
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,674
Speaker 1: No, so they show up to.

130
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,940
Speaker 1: you know, the student government people are having this event.

131
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:11,410
Speaker 1: They show up and they find that the stage that they have scheduled is already occupied by the anime club Which is having a martial arts demonstration.

132
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:21,026
Speaker 1: but obviously when you read the description these people are just Cosplaying as Dragon Ball characters and Pretending to fight with each other.

133
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:21,507
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

134
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:24,357
Speaker 0: Now had this anime club reserved the stage duly?

135
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:25,280
Speaker 1: they did.

136
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:34,917
Speaker 1: They actually reserved it before the student government people did and the student government people had to leave that Harkins back to our IT on at least a hundred different.

137
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:44,155
Speaker 1: Okay me Apparently the you know event office of student activities fucked That's the same room to two people at the same time.

138
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:51,457
Speaker 0: Ah See that happened a lot at our IT where we'd plan an event for the anime club and some other group.

139
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:58,783
Speaker 0: most often It was the women's group on campus the Women's Center who I have but also the players RIT players.

140
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:00,289
Speaker 0: the players almost never really gotten.

141
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:03,039
Speaker 1: our way was well, they could be in the hall at the other side of the hall.

142
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:04,656
Speaker 0: Yeah But that didn't cause any trouble.

143
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:04,960
Speaker 0: one.

144
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:15,788
Speaker 0: The only problem we ever had was at the Women's Center because they'd always get mad That there was noise going on outside of whatever event they were having That they somehow didn't seem to look at the calendar and see that.

145
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:28,300
Speaker 0: oh the anime club is planning some sort of horrible gigantic Festering massive fanboys watching anime and dancing for four or five hours and they would just schedule their vagina monologues or whatever.

146
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:29,904
Speaker 1: Good job.

147
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,789
Speaker 1: I'm checking that schedule there.

148
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,752
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

149
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:35,800
Speaker 1: It's a good idea to have our convention the same weekend as Otacon.

150
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,927
Speaker 1: I don't need to look at schedules of other things.

151
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:39,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure I can reserve the BCC.

152
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:46,340
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Jimmy easy Okay, I'll just reserve the Javits for tomorrow and I'm gonna mention the funny thing about that one instant.

153
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:57,098
Speaker 0: Was that this Women's Center the guy who runs the Women's Center came over and he's yelling at me in this tire Like you've got to turn that loud crazy music down and you're ruining my event.

154
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:57,720
Speaker 0: blah blah blah.

155
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:02,575
Speaker 0: I'm gonna call campus safety and I was like go ahead and call campus safety.

156
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:04,000
Speaker 0: You knew we had this room.

157
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,199
Speaker 0: I got the piece of paper saying I have this room.

158
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,739
Speaker 0: What do you think campus safety is gonna say?

159
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:15,387
Speaker 1: And it gets a person pretty pissed off when you pretty much say haha you're wrong nothing you can do With one exception.

160
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:17,619
Speaker 0: that guy is the most indignant person I've ever met.

161
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:25,820
Speaker 0: Well, you're one person more than one person and I met that person while waiting at the law Lewiston bridge into Canada once.

162
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:36,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just want to point out one more time that the anime club at Temple University probably cool people but they were Randomly for no reason at all other than to have fun.

163
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,099
Speaker 1: I guess if they like that sort of thing was cosplaying Dragon Ball and pretending to fight each other.

164
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:44,542
Speaker 0: They called it a martial arts Demonstration.

165
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:46,548
Speaker 1: I assume so are these guys like?

166
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:50,700
Speaker 1: are you sure this wasn't the temple elementary school my anime club?

167
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,492
Speaker 1: Or perhaps the temple middle school anime club.

168
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:54,979
Speaker 0: What kind of event is that?

169
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,657
Speaker 0: I don't know but granted that makes the humiliation of the actual legitimate student government that much more hilarious.

170
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:02,740
Speaker 1: That is the point.

171
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:12,724
Speaker 0: Things Of the day.

172
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:19,591
Speaker 0: right along with my news about that funeral for that fake character from that Japanese cartoon I've got a link to said Japanese cartoon.

173
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:42,381
Speaker 0: now more specifically we've been watching a bunch of and then head exploding all over YouTube and In case you wondered what fist of the North Star is actually about as opposed to what we said It's about this is the third half of the third half the third section the third third of the first episode of Fist of the North Star

174
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:43,529
Speaker 1: the first episode ever.

175
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:50,750
Speaker 0: Pretty much it explains everything that matters about this show in the course of about three minutes.

176
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:54,560
Speaker 1: Yeah having you know here people constantly talk about the show.

177
00:12:54,781 --> 00:13:04,530
Speaker 1: knowing about the show knowing it's an important piece of anime history Playing a fun video game based on it and such and such we decided it was actually time to try to watch it.

178
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:12,125
Speaker 1: So we went to YouTube and we watched the first episode and is the part that everyone who's an anime fan Should watch whether you like it or not.

179
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:14,397
Speaker 0: yep And all I've learned is that one.

180
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:21,250
Speaker 0: it is generally hilarious to watch a man's head explode And I could watch that over and over again for a great time to come.

181
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:23,810
Speaker 1: I think it's just the way they animate the head exploding.

182
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,962
Speaker 0: It's like they put more effort into animating the heads exploding than they do anything else.

183
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:30,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the people just stand there.

184
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,635
Speaker 1: They don't talk much.

185
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:35,590
Speaker 1: They don't move much, but when the heads explode that's when the action is.

186
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:42,770
Speaker 0: But as far as I can gather I can't ever see myself Liking this show in a non-ironic fashion.

187
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:44,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have to agree.

188
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:51,808
Speaker 1: I mean it is hilarious to watch the fights even though There's no interesting fight choreography at least not in the fights that we've seen.

189
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:54,179
Speaker 1: But in the plot.

190
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:56,110
Speaker 1: the overall plot seems to be interesting.

191
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:02,308
Speaker 1: You know there's a big post-apocalyptic world where stuff happens, and there's dangerous shit going down etc.

192
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:02,469
Speaker 1: etc.

193
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:08,828
Speaker 1: That is interesting, but any individual episode seems to just be a formulaic shown.

194
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:10,864
Speaker 0: in fighting There's a guy.

195
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,612
Speaker 1: There's a guy Trouble.

196
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:14,475
Speaker 1: we must fight.

197
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:20,949
Speaker 0: and the thing is it's not like choreographed fight scenes because I've seen a lot of anime that were dumb But I'd really good fight scenes.

198
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,100
Speaker 0: I've seen anime that were really good and had really good fight scenes and bad.

199
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:26,850
Speaker 0: fist of the North Star is a fighting anime.

200
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,650
Speaker 0: Ostensibly though, I guess it isn't really because there aren't fights.

201
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:33,530
Speaker 0: It's pretty much just two muscly guys going.

202
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:37,179
Speaker 0: I'm the blob blob blob and what.

203
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,875
Speaker 0: the other muscly guy just stands there with his heavy eyebrows clowering and then With his crap animation.

204
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:45,239
Speaker 0: it's just garbage.

205
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,402
Speaker 0: I gotta say it.

206
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:47,044
Speaker 0: It's garbage.

207
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:47,826
Speaker 0: It's not good.

208
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,130
Speaker 1: It's old 80s animation.

209
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,310
Speaker 1: So yeah, yeah, it's not as bad as this other animation that we're not gonna talk about yet cuz the secret.

210
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:56,195
Speaker 0: Oh that fucking thing.

211
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,598
Speaker 0: yeah, oh my god.

212
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,242
Speaker 0: You guys are in for a treat.

213
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, eventually we saw something.

214
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:02,370
Speaker 1: we saw something.

215
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,721
Speaker 0: We're not even gonna hint at what it is.

216
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:06,610
Speaker 1: Nope, except this bad.

217
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:07,250
Speaker 0: Yeah.

218
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:13,550
Speaker 0: So if nothing else watch this bit and you'll know everything you ever will need to know about fist of the North Star.

219
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:20,610
Speaker 0: And if you find yourself Liking this you think hey, I want to see the show that has this plots.

220
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:29,814
Speaker 0: Well, I'd recommend just searching on YouTube for Hokuto no Ken watching the first 15 non anime music video videos that show up Non video game.

221
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:40,950
Speaker 0: also, yes down video game and that's really all you need to do when you when you see a man Who has a shotgun and the only reason that he doesn't just kill Kenshiro is that when Kenshiro punched him earlier?

222
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:48,990
Speaker 0: He did it in such a way as to mess with the guy's body Is that every time he tried to shoot the gun the gun spun around and pointed at him instead?

223
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:52,367
Speaker 0: That's what fist of the North Star is.

224
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:55,925
Speaker 1: yeah I mean that has nothing to do with the overall plot of the show of folks.

225
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:56,970
Speaker 1: post-apocalyptic world.

226
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:05,385
Speaker 0: Self hilarious Overall plot is only awesome If someone explains it to you or spoils that or just tells it to you like it's a story.

227
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:07,910
Speaker 0: if you actually watch it It's really not so cool.

228
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:16,061
Speaker 1: Imagine getting this giant awesome plot and then having it being doled out to you in the tiniest portions Possible like one word at a time like a word a week.

229
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,626
Speaker 1: That's that's what mr.

230
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,469
Speaker 1: North Star hits.

231
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:22,608
Speaker 1: Worse than one piece and I may be well, maybe not as bad as one piece.

232
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:35,249
Speaker 0: anyway You know what this is what in regards to all these fighting shown in whatever shows I would rather watch all of fist of the North Star then watch even half of one piece or bleach or Naruto at this point.

233
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:42,490
Speaker 1: No, it's it's got to be tough because I haven't watched enough of any of them to really say which one would be the most tolerable.

234
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:50,164
Speaker 0: I think fist of the North Star is because I can take it in a purely Laughable way if I view it as a comedy and not as a serious show.

235
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:58,367
Speaker 1: It is so much more tolerable All right, so we've used funny Japanese prank videos as things of the day before.

236
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:01,015
Speaker 1: we had the one with the Guy tries to pee.

237
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:03,950
Speaker 1: guy tries to pee in the porta potty and it lifts him up out of the roof.

238
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:14,916
Speaker 1: We've had the one at the snow mountain where people You know sit down in like a massage chair or whatever it was and it just sends them out onto the to the the mountain And they start sliding down the hill.

239
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:26,837
Speaker 0: Well, the problem with these videos was that while they were awesome There was a lot of buildup and explanation and they only actually showed them getting like four or five different people and they showed the Same prank every time.

240
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,770
Speaker 1: so it's like once you were onto the third or fourth guy.

241
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,257
Speaker 1: It was just like all right.

242
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:32,769
Speaker 1: It's the same thing as before just a different reaction shot.

243
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:38,170
Speaker 0: granted They always saved the last one for the guy who got injured or the guy who got stuck or hitting the head or something.

244
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:43,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah Here is a Japanese prank video that mixes up a lot of different pranks.

245
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:44,030
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

246
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, first they've got like a stuffed animal of some sort that makes a horrible roaring noise.

247
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:52,689
Speaker 1: They've got a guy jumping out of a trash can you don't realize he's in there.

248
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:56,667
Speaker 1: They've got a fake snowball that they roll down a hill at.

249
00:17:56,728 --> 00:17:59,114
Speaker 0: people Snowballs the best one.

250
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:07,841
Speaker 1: they've got a fake rock that they roll down the street and a guy as he comes around the corner on The salaryman comes around the corner suddenly behind him Indiana Jones Boulder.

251
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though it's fake.

252
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:10,569
Speaker 1: They've got.

253
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:15,010
Speaker 1: Some guy was bowling and he had a fake bowling ball.

254
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:23,870
Speaker 0: That one was great because even though I knew this was a video of pranks They were obviously were all pranks and not like prank with a tire iron but real pranks.

255
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,174
Speaker 0: Thanks that don't kill people.

256
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:30,330
Speaker 0: and for I flinched when the bowling ball went back because for a second my mind said that's a bowling ball.

257
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:33,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, all I gotta say is I need me a fake bowling ball.

258
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:39,610
Speaker 0: Oh hardcore I mean, so I mean we have that fake rock that we've gotten almost everyone we know with it's really not.

259
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:40,936
Speaker 0: I'm gonna ruin it now.

260
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:43,628
Speaker 1: No one's ever gonna get caught by the fake rock ever again.

261
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:47,785
Speaker 1: now No, but the fake bowling ball fake bowling ball could work.

262
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:52,489
Speaker 0: You got to be at a bowling alley though I don't think either one of us should ruin what the last prank is.

263
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,514
Speaker 1: I don't remember what it is.

264
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:56,306
Speaker 0: So awesome when they put something in the bathroom.

265
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,215
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, the prank is.

266
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:00,478
Speaker 0: guy is trying to pee.

267
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,607
Speaker 0: There is something in the bathroom with him.

268
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:06,937
Speaker 0: I remember now Who thought of that?

269
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,802
Speaker 1: I don't know.

270
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:09,250
Speaker 1: crazy Japanese people.

271
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:11,136
Speaker 1: They think of all this crazy shit.

272
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:12,902
Speaker 1: I mean they have funerals for fictional people.

273
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:13,384
Speaker 1: Come on.

274
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:14,830
Speaker 1: This is nothing compared to that.

275
00:19:15,472 --> 00:19:32,167
Speaker 0: so tonight since there has been due to popular demand a Demand that was a poorly phrased way to open this very for us to do comics a little bit since we do mostly Anime and manga lately partly because Scott reads more comics than I do which isn't that many and I read

276
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,135
Speaker 1: and most of the comics I read or manga

277
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:37,250
Speaker 0: and I read almost zero non manga comics.

278
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:43,299
Speaker 0: So every now and then it's gotta leave something on my desk and if I ever get to it I'll read it and then we'll do a show on it eventually.

279
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,725
Speaker 0: and such a thing has happened and I finally read a comic Oh my god rim read economy.

280
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:56,129
Speaker 1: So DMZ on the ground and while on the ground is the name of the first trade paperback The second trade paperback is named something else.

281
00:19:56,531 --> 00:20:01,269
Speaker 0: I say specifically on the ground because now they one of us have read anything but on the ground from DMZ.

282
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:04,430
Speaker 1: Yes, I would read the second trade but I have not bought it yet.

283
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:06,616
Speaker 1: So, I don't know idea what happens in it.

284
00:20:07,137 --> 00:20:12,050
Speaker 1: needless to say DMZ is a comic published by vertigo written by Brian would.

285
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,850
Speaker 1: The artist is an Italian name that I don't really want to attempt to say.

286
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,933
Speaker 1: Do you want to attempt to say it?

287
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:18,979
Speaker 0: It says John Doe in parentheses.

288
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:19,761
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go with that.

289
00:20:20,062 --> 00:20:20,463
Speaker 1: Really?

290
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:22,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

291
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:23,412
Speaker 1: Wow That's pretty funny.

292
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:25,337
Speaker 0: Ricardo Bertielli.

293
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:29,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently it's the first American comic he's ever done really?

294
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:30,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

295
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:37,009
Speaker 0: Now the story or I guess the story is one thing and then the background to the story is something else.

296
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:42,450
Speaker 0: and I'll say right now that I really like this and I am generally cynical about comics.

297
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,095
Speaker 0: So for me that says a lot.

298
00:20:44,236 --> 00:20:48,510
Speaker 0: to get me to say after I read a comic that it was tolerable is quite a feat.

299
00:20:48,972 --> 00:20:49,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean this comic.

300
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:51,949
Speaker 1: I read it not knowing anything about it.

301
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:55,238
Speaker 1: I bought it because it was the first bird.

302
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:57,444
Speaker 1: It was in volume one of a vertigo series.

303
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:03,369
Speaker 1: So they're usually cheap and You can get to know whether you're gonna want to read the rest of the thing or not.

304
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:05,399
Speaker 1: And it was also pretty popular.

305
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:08,729
Speaker 1: So I said hey, I'll see what this thing's about and if I don't like it I just won't buy anymore.

306
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:14,401
Speaker 0: It's also set in Manhattan and we all seem to have a general fondness for things that are set in places We live or know.

307
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,833
Speaker 1: well I think most people.

308
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:29,261
Speaker 1: you know when something is set where they live or they they kind of like to go read it because then You can look in it and see stuff Like if you have been to Manhattan, you can see places in this book and you're like, hey, that's a building I seen that's a building.

309
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:29,784
Speaker 1: I was in.

310
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:31,254
Speaker 1: that's a street I was on.

311
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:38,230
Speaker 0: see that's a dangerous road to follow because I Still kind of want to see eight mile just to see if it's actually like eight mile.

312
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,959
Speaker 0: Get stabbed, but at the same time I don't want to.

313
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,690
Speaker 0: I don't know if I ever told the story about the stabbin.

314
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,994
Speaker 1: They're fake stem.

315
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:47,319
Speaker 1: I don't know if I did.

316
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,466
Speaker 1: I think we did because we told the movies.

317
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:50,409
Speaker 1: you see guys, too.

318
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:52,878
Speaker 0: Maybe we just told him.

319
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:53,321
Speaker 0: I don't know.

320
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:54,288
Speaker 1: I don't remember anyway.

321
00:21:55,413 --> 00:22:00,610
Speaker 0: So the the background here to this story is a little bit far-fetched.

322
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:08,567
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna read from the back because this puts it together very succinctly with overseas wars bogging down the Army and National Guard, huh?

323
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,620
Speaker 1: Politics coming into this little bit loving.

324
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:19,049
Speaker 0: the US government mistakenly Neglects the very real threat of anti-establishment militias scattered throughout the United States.

325
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:35,548
Speaker 0: Like a sleeping giant middle America rises up and violently pushes its way to the shining seas Sparking a second American Civil War coming to a sandstill Standstill at the line in the sand Manhattan or as the world now knows it the DMZ.

326
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:42,895
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you look at like the first page of the trade it shows this little map and on the map There are three areas.

327
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:46,530
Speaker 1: Basically, there's New Jersey in England, which is the free states.

328
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:52,110
Speaker 1: There's Manhattan, which is the DMZ and there's Brooklyn Queens Long Island and the United States.

329
00:22:52,651 --> 00:23:04,990
Speaker 0: Now aside from the fact that right there the setup that they have contrived to make Manhattan the place where this actually takes place is a little bit far-fetched Yeah for a number of reasons.

330
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:23,027
Speaker 1: I mean seriously what kind of armed United States Revolution is gonna conquer all the way up to New Jersey Not get over the Hudson and then the United States is somehow not gonna be taking Manhattan And taking only the parts East and then Manhattan itself is gonna be all weird and in the middle.

331
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:27,250
Speaker 0: now granted There are a lot of anti-establishment militias in the United States.

332
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,720
Speaker 0: there's actually far more of them than you would probably ever believe.

333
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:40,995
Speaker 0: I grew up in Michigan and there are a lot of people living in the.

334
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,302
Speaker 0: They have to rise up and be true patriots.

335
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:44,208
Speaker 1: Yeah.

336
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:47,390
Speaker 1: Well Those crazy people can stay in their fortresses.

337
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,731
Speaker 1: Well,

338
00:23:47,751 --> 00:24:04,225
Speaker 0: the thing is even if you got all of them together and they somehow coordinated despite the fact that none of them trust each other at all I Somehow doubt that these militia could do anything in the face of the United States military Which pretty much would just cruise missile them.

339
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:11,650
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, regardless of the feasibility of the premise of this story the story itself is actually pretty cool.

340
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:16,085
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see the story is one of a little kid named Maddy Roth.

341
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:16,827
Speaker 0: He's not a little kid.

342
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:17,670
Speaker 0: He's some college punk.

343
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,213
Speaker 1: Yeah He's 20-something.

344
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:25,350
Speaker 0: a quote naive aspiring photojournalist lands a dream gig following a veteran war correspondent into the heart of the DMZ.

345
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:30,166
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically you have this guy who's like the greatest journalist in the world.

346
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:31,370
Speaker 1: He's like the king of journalism.

347
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,761
Speaker 0: He's also a total cock.

348
00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:42,197
Speaker 1: he's also a total asshole Yes, and he's going into the DMZ to get the story of the century, you know to do a huge Photo write-up video everything.

349
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:47,391
Speaker 1: and they've got a helicopter and they've got a bunch of equipment and a bunch of guards and they they got Everything.

350
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:56,489
Speaker 1: and this guy is 20-something college kid is the intern and he's going into the DMZ with his big crew - cuz no one goes in the DMZ.

351
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:02,366
Speaker 1: It's like this incredibly dangerous area in between these two war like at war forces.

352
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:03,890
Speaker 1: So no one goes there.

353
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:11,350
Speaker 1: I mean Manhattan Like right now has millions of people in it and in the story the DMZ is down to like four hundred thousand people in it.

354
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:12,189
Speaker 1: There's no one there.

355
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:20,510
Speaker 0: Well, there are evacuation routes and there are theoretically plans and systems in place to evacuate all of Manhattan in fairly short order.

356
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:24,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder how well those would actually work, but that's beside the point.

357
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:33,734
Speaker 1: regardless in the story There's only four hundred thousand people there which leaves it pretty sparse and these guys are going in to get the story because no one Else goes there now.

358
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:36,465
Speaker 0: minor spoiler, but this happens right away.

359
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:37,830
Speaker 1: It happens like on the first page.

360
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:38,594
Speaker 0: This is the.

361
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:46,102
Speaker 0: the plot is they land in by helicopter And are immediately attacked by just people in Manhattan.

362
00:25:46,443 --> 00:25:55,300
Speaker 0: the entire crew just about is killed Including the stupid cock reporter guy Yeah, and the only one left alive is the intern.

363
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,730
Speaker 0: the intern and all of the equipment is still there.

364
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:00,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, so now he's freaking out.

365
00:26:00,703 --> 00:26:01,750
Speaker 0: He's trapped in this war zone.

366
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:02,605
Speaker 0: He doesn't know what to do.

367
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:10,772
Speaker 0: One thing leads to another and the story of DMZ is that he is now living in the DMZ on his own Covering.

368
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:11,997
Speaker 0: what's going on there?

369
00:26:12,177 --> 00:26:13,583
Speaker 1: He's the only reporter there.

370
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:15,270
Speaker 1: He's the only reporter to ever be there.

371
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:23,109
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess since it was normal Manhattan and He's just some intern punk with a lot of equipment and he's trying to get by.

372
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:27,830
Speaker 1: and It's pretty cool because you've actually got like two different things going on.

373
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,675
Speaker 1: You've got the story of the world and the setting that you don't know much about and this guy is Reporting on it.

374
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:42,449
Speaker 1: and as he's reporting on it and learning about it You're learning about it, too and you've also got the story of the guy and how is he not gonna die today?

375
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:45,546
Speaker 1: and They sort of go hand in hand.

376
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:47,448
Speaker 1: It's like Pretty cool.

377
00:26:47,944 --> 00:26:51,542
Speaker 0: I mean I really do enjoy it though the plot moves along at just about the pace.

378
00:26:51,562 --> 00:26:53,329
Speaker 0: that'll keep me going and give me interest.

379
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:55,829
Speaker 1: actually The one thing that kind of bothered me though, is that?

380
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:09,529
Speaker 1: Obviously this thing was written originally as separate comic book issues and you can you know You it's marked where the issues begin and end but the plot definitely jumps in between issues like in the first issue He kind of meets someone and the second issue.

381
00:27:09,912 --> 00:27:12,149
Speaker 1: It's like they were best friends and they skipped a whole bunch of stuff.

382
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:19,638
Speaker 0: But granted I'm glad they skipped that because they skipped all the parts that usually I find tedious or take forever or Get on with it.

383
00:27:19,658 --> 00:27:21,030
Speaker 0: I want to see what's gonna happen later.

384
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:24,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a. I definitely don't mind it but it is slightly jarring like what?

385
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,310
Speaker 1: Oh, they just skipped a bunch of stuff, you know as opposed it doesn't feel a hundred percent natural.

386
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,760
Speaker 1: It actually takes me out for like a second and I go.

387
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:33,226
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, they must have skipped some stuff.

388
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,110
Speaker 1: That's not so important.

389
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:35,470
Speaker 0: All right, I get back into it.

390
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:55,001
Speaker 0: I feel the opposite to me by skipping that I feel like the relationships are a lot more real and natural Because now I didn't have to rely on direct continuous storytelling of building the relationships and all of these things that and then it gets right to the meat and Instead of having the imperfect memory of what was written down.

391
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:57,490
Speaker 0: It was just skipped and I just don't even worry about it.

392
00:27:57,751 --> 00:27:58,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I agree.

393
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,310
Speaker 1: It's just that I notice it Like I noticed that it was skipped and that takes me out of it for a second.

394
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,402
Speaker 0: I didn't really notice at first like I just totally blew by it.

395
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:11,020
Speaker 1: Oh, see I totally noticed like whoa Why are they acting all super friendly all of a sudden?

396
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,590
Speaker 1: they weren't acting super friendly five pages ago.

397
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:17,190
Speaker 1: They must have just you know, oh, it's in the future some all right.

398
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:25,950
Speaker 0: The other nice thing is that it really doesn't follow the kind of stereotypical plot You would expect and the situation progresses fairly rapidly.

399
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:31,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like each issue like shows you a different aspect of what's going on in the DMZ.

400
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:42,970
Speaker 1: It's like in one issue They show you these guys who are defending Central Park and another issue They show you this guy who's a sniper aiming across at New Jersey where there's a girl and he's like, hey, what's up?

401
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,213
Speaker 0: I love those two.

402
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:46,823
Speaker 0: their relationship consists of shooting at each other.

403
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:48,570
Speaker 1: That's pretty awesome, right?

404
00:28:49,832 --> 00:29:09,990
Speaker 0: Now it gets a little far-fetched at times that like there's one group of people who hold up I think near Central Park in the zoo and they've basically got their own society and their own science and their own agriculture and Some people have Restaurants and tofu garden things set up on the roofs of buildings and a lot of it's a little bit far-fetched.

405
00:29:10,271 --> 00:29:13,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, but while it's far-fetched, it's entertaining.

406
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:13,647
Speaker 1: It's like.

407
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:15,775
Speaker 1: it's like, okay This would never be.

408
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:19,810
Speaker 1: if this if you're trying to tell me this is real then I'm not going to believe you.

409
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:25,412
Speaker 1: But regardless the idea of this is awesome and I am happy that I am reading it, you know it's like.

410
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:38,606
Speaker 1: I would never expect there to be a tofu garden or some guys hiding in Central Park if Manhattan suddenly became like the most war Crazied place in the entire world, but if there was that would be totally awesome.

411
00:29:38,826 --> 00:29:42,848
Speaker 1: and reading about it existing It's sort of like a nice little fantasy world like woohoo.

412
00:29:43,653 --> 00:29:56,550
Speaker 0: And there's a bit at the end of this volume Which I don't really want to go into it because it was really cool and I don't want to spoil it for you But suffice to say they go about a way of revealing a whole bunch of story.

413
00:29:56,911 --> 00:30:13,926
Speaker 0: Not so much story is what's going on with the plot but story as kind of the overarching Where this thing's going the direction of it how the characters have evolved over time and it all revolves around this chase That culminates in not really a cliffhanger, but definitely set up for the next volume.

414
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:14,668
Speaker 0: Yeah.

415
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:18,506
Speaker 0: Yeah I really can't say more without ruining it, but I think Scott knows what I'm talking about.

416
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:19,230
Speaker 0: I think it's really cool.

417
00:30:19,835 --> 00:30:25,670
Speaker 1: it is pretty cool and It's sort of crazy to think about where it could go because it can go so many different ways.

418
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:32,470
Speaker 1: It's like they're sort of revealing that they're going to reveal as opposed to just revealing and I kind of like that.

419
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:36,103
Speaker 0: Yep, the one thing I got to say is that the manga got the manga.

420
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:37,870
Speaker 0: the comic is definitely manga.

421
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:46,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks like and it generally goes along the lines of yeah these rebels are bad But you guys the u.s.

422
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:48,335
Speaker 0: Are just as bad with the things you're doing.

423
00:30:48,716 --> 00:31:03,053
Speaker 0: but everything I look at so far I Would be under the impression that the rebels are bad in almost every sense and I'm pretty much Entirely on the side of the actual still standing United States so far.

424
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:29,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean politically speaking I mean if you look at this as a commentary on the real-world politics I would probably agree with you, but in terms of the book itself, you know Where politics are not real and it's totally fake and it's just a fantasy world I find myself just siding with the people in the DMZ and everyone else sucks because most of the time you see you're hanging out In the DMZ where people are just trying to scrape by and you sort of feel bad for them.

425
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:32,029
Speaker 1: And yeah they're the ones who are having the hard time.

426
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:32,932
Speaker 1: and there you see you.

427
00:31:32,953 --> 00:31:34,459
Speaker 1: actually those are the characters you get to know.

428
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:39,540
Speaker 1: and You know, I'm sure if it took place say in the US and you got to know those characters.

429
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:45,103
Speaker 1: It's like as soon as you get to know people you're on their side and in the book the people you get to know more Than anyone.

430
00:31:45,123 --> 00:31:47,619
Speaker 1: or of course the reporter guy and the people in the DMZ.

431
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:49,347
Speaker 1: yeah, of course you're on their side.

432
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:54,123
Speaker 0: at the same time a lot of the people in the DMZ are Really fucked up.

433
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:55,287
Speaker 1: Yeah,

434
00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:59,740
Speaker 0: there's Mad Max tribal societies and scary people and

435
00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:12,466
Speaker 1: constantly talk about like which neighborhoods you can't go to because people just shoot you and how to like approach people who haven't seen you before because people will recognize you because there aren't so many people around and It's

436
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:13,620
Speaker 0: it's really cool.

437
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:21,420
Speaker 0: Oh as the plot goes on He starts becoming famous in the DMZ and everyone kind of knows him and they just let him to his devices.

438
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the trademark actually of the thing is the the press jacket.

439
00:32:26,742 --> 00:32:28,289
Speaker 1: It's like oh he's wearing the press jacket.

440
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:33,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a good scene where in a stroke of genius They spray paint in white press on his back.

441
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,439
Speaker 0: So a sniper doesn't shoot him while they tend to some wounded guy.

442
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:41,080
Speaker 0: Yep, plus he's got an actual legitimate press pass a badge that he carries around.

443
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,171
Speaker 1: There's actually a t-shirt you can buy but I think it's sold out.

444
00:32:44,252 --> 00:32:47,023
Speaker 1: but some comic book store in LA was selling it for A little while.

445
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:53,799
Speaker 1: they might have it again where it had like sort of a DMZ logo on the front And if you turn the shirt inside out, it would say press on the back.

446
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:58,535
Speaker 1: It was I kind of wanted one but when I went and they were sold out I just stopped trying.

447
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:10,140
Speaker 0: Oh, well, yeah Yeah Well be a semi short episode tonight partly because there's not much more we can say without going into the plot or ruining it Or anything and we'll definitely have to save that for some final thoughts after we read the rest of it.

448
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,844
Speaker 1: Yeah, DMZ.

449
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:13,519
Speaker 1: It's a comic about a civil war in the United States.

450
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,491
Speaker 1: It's a survival tale of a guy stuck in a crazy war zone.

451
00:33:17,591 --> 00:33:18,413
Speaker 0: The story is dark.

452
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:19,577
Speaker 0: The art is dark.

453
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,540
Speaker 0: It's pretty violent.

454
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:25,805
Speaker 1: yeah, it's a political commentary and It's pretty awesome.

455
00:33:25,926 --> 00:33:26,750
Speaker 1: And everyone should read it.

456
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:27,573
Speaker 1: if you have.

457
00:33:27,593 --> 00:33:29,100
Speaker 1: how much does it cost like 10 bucks?

458
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,948
Speaker 0: Yep, 10 bucks pretty cheap plus goddamn.

459
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:34,657
Speaker 0: I'm actually planning to read a lot more comics now.

460
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:39,986
Speaker 0: Oh Nois Yeah, well the thing is I normally I always drive into work so I was rocking the podcast.

461
00:33:40,428 --> 00:34:05,297
Speaker 0: but since I went into Manhattan last night and I realized something when I woke up this morning and went back to work and I did the reverse commute You know, I woke up went to Grand Central and I took a train north to my job and it was pretty awesome To wake up and shower and then walk out a door and immediately be immersed and see if people in downtown, New York City Mm-hmm, like it's not down downtown, but you get the idea and then I don't know.

462
00:34:05,338 --> 00:34:05,960
Speaker 0: I like the train.

463
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:07,478
Speaker 0: So I'm starting to take the train to work.

464
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,577
Speaker 0: now I'm just leaving my car parked down in the Bronx and I'll just take the train to it every what.

465
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:14,567
Speaker 0: if you need the car Here, when do I ever need my car here?

466
00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:18,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you have to go somewhere where somewhere where am I gonna go?

467
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,648
Speaker 0: Plus I'm gonna take the car back on weekends.

468
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:21,973
Speaker 0: I still gotta get the car repaired.

469
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:23,420
Speaker 1: Yeah car needs some repairs.

470
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:26,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, but man if I could afford it I would live in Manhattan in a second.

471
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,780
Speaker 1: Yeah I just hope it doesn't become a terrible war zone and you'll be alright.

472
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:34,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, if Manhattan becomes a terrible war zone moving back to Beacon.

473
00:34:35,522 --> 00:34:38,360
Speaker 1: But what beacon was a war zone and in the last revolution?

474
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,284
Speaker 0: No, it really wasn't.

475
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:41,226
Speaker 0: beacon was just us.

476
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:43,053
Speaker 0: I don't know if any battles happened here.

477
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:43,755
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

478
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:44,940
Speaker 1: pretty sure there was a battle.

479
00:34:45,353 --> 00:34:53,199
Speaker 0: No The the most history of beacon I've seen is that whatever British troops are on the move They lit signal beacons at the top of Mount beacon to war in Washington.

480
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:57,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a. there's a statue of George Washington like over by that corner.

481
00:34:57,712 --> 00:34:57,932
Speaker 0: Yep.

482
00:34:57,952 --> 00:35:15,438
Speaker 0: Yep, even though this is the saddest thing Up at the top of Mount beacon the Daughters the American Revolution the original ones way back Erected a monument to commemorate everything that had been done in the Revolutionary War and it wasn't that long ago that Vandals for no apparent reason knocked it over and destroyed it.

483
00:35:16,303 --> 00:35:17,126
Speaker 1: Okay.

484
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:17,789
Speaker 0: Yep.

485
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,080
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah and one last bit here.

486
00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:29,154
Speaker 0: I didn't really do a news because this is definitely the earliest of tenuous information But an anonymous source has informed us that people have been talking about Otacon.

487
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:38,460
Speaker 0: this year might have some bigger important guests and The word on the street is say you all right that could mean any number of things depending on how you look at it.

488
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:42,020
Speaker 0: I can think of a few people who might fit that description.

489
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,032
Speaker 0: That would also be big-name guests or maybe troops of people.

490
00:35:45,715 --> 00:35:47,080
Speaker 0: I guess that's all I know.

491
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,360
Speaker 0: It's not like I can say anything more other than wild rampant speculation.

492
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:57,180
Speaker 1: I mean that really shouldn't matter to you Because if you can go to Otacon you should already be going regardless of what the word on the street is.

493
00:35:57,381 --> 00:36:01,140
Speaker 0: See the thing is when it comes to Otacon I keep abreast of what's gonna happen there.

494
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,187
Speaker 0: What's gonna be there what music act will be there because I like to know ahead of time and it makes me excited about it But I'm gonna go no matter what.

495
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:13,237
Speaker 1: so it's not like I would go if they said yeah Otacon We don't have any guests this year because we fucked up.

496
00:36:13,317 --> 00:36:18,769
Speaker 0: We'll see the Otacon even if the con Didn't happen somehow.

497
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,080
Speaker 0: if all that the con was one year.

498
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,923
Speaker 1: Oh it was rent.

499
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:30,073
Speaker 0: the BC was the BCC rented out and no events and it was just 25,000 anime geeks in a building together for three days.

500
00:36:30,575 --> 00:36:31,879
Speaker 0: That's pretty much what it is now.

501
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:47,441
Speaker 1: anyway It's not like I go to many panels Yeah, oh and speaking of going to things this Saturday, so three days from now April 21st 2007 is gaming for hope at Marist.

00:38:40,371 --> 00:38:45,839
Speaker 1: yeah, I would have gotten more sleep last night But I had to do laundry because there was no way I could have done it this weekend or any other day.

532
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,491
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you also probably played some pokemons.

533
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:49,953
Speaker 1: No.

534
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:53,324
Speaker 1: I didn't I just did laundry and as soon as laundry was done I dropped it in my room went to bed.

Speaker 1: really yep wow yep.

536
00:38:55,852 --> 00:38:57,678

00:38:58,179 --> 00:38:59,329
Speaker 0: great There's a little restaurant.

538
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:02,849
Speaker 0: They actually bring a little fire out But it's this pink goop, and they light it on fire.

539
00:39:03,231 --> 00:39:06,098
Speaker 0: We asked him what it was and they weren't sure other than that It's toxic.

540
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:11,420
Speaker 0: But they light it on fire in the middle of the table, and then they give you a bunch of marshmallows and chocolate.

541
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:13,845
Speaker 0: It was pretty badass.

542
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:16,355
Speaker 1: I gotta say I guess you could if you could think of it.

543
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,420
Speaker 1: You'll find it somewhere.

544
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:27,780
Speaker 0: I love Manhattan until there's a civil war Yeah, but then I can be some sort of awesome geek nights reporter And I'll wander around with a press pass and no one will shoot at me because I'm just so badass.

545
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:34,160
