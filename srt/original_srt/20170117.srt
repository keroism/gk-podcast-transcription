1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,572
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday January 17th 2017.

2
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:16,196
Speaker 0: I'm rim, I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:22,019
Speaker 0: We're back from mag fast talking about Poppin by Friedman freeze.

4
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:24,637
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:28,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're back from mag fest.

6
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:31,300
Speaker 0: as you know mag fest is a tiring convention.

7
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:39,400
Speaker 0: So, uh didn't do a show on Monday because we got back on Sunday And then I had to go to the dentist on Wednesday to get one cavity filled.

8
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:43,700
Speaker 1: You said it was a regular dentist, but no you had too much.

9
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:56,060
Speaker 0: So basically every dentist appointment for some time now like everyone for like a year and a half The dude's been like there's a spot on this one tooth and someday that's gonna be a cavity as well.

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,005
Speaker 0: It's keep an eye on it.

11
00:00:57,388 --> 00:00:59,560
Speaker 1: and he was like, why don't you take care of it?

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,604
Speaker 1: So it doesn't become a cavity.

13
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:03,819
Speaker 0: He basically said there's nothing you can do like it's stop eating the sugar now.

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,850
Speaker 1: That's not to stop drinking the Red Bull.

15
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:09,420
Speaker 0: No, I drink so little Caffeinated beverage like that.

16
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:11,948
Speaker 1: You drink gallons.

17
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,760
Speaker 0: that is definitely not the problem.

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,120
Speaker 1: What if we took all the Red Bull you ever drank and put it in a bucket?

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,265
Speaker 1: That'd be some big-ass bucket.

20
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:18,331
Speaker 0: It would probably not.

21
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:20,160
Speaker 1: that would be a frighteningly large bucket.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,452
Speaker 0: That would make you you forget the Red Bulls come in tiny cans.

23
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:24,837
Speaker 0: It's like a little tiny baby.

24
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:25,760
Speaker 0: can I drink?

25
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:26,612
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know.

26
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,079
Speaker 0: to a week.

27
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:32,240
Speaker 1: I seem to remember there being various incidences where entire cases of Red Bull were purchased and then disappeared.

28
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:35,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, those were not just consumed by me though.

29
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:37,813
Speaker 0: Those are consumed by a certain Fat Fonson.

30
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:38,317
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:47,079
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah We're back geek nights as normal and magfest was great as always and I already kind of regret the fact that I'm not currently there.

32
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:50,692
Speaker 1: Well magfest has many other events that you we go to none of.

33
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,680
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz they're always at bad times.

34
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:55,339
Speaker 1: There's like a magfest labs and there's a mag.

35
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:57,505
Speaker 1: The mag stock.

36
00:01:57,927 --> 00:02:04,374
Speaker 0: every well mag stock I think in particular was during a convention We were at as a West Coast mag thing of some kind.

37
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:05,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, and West Coast is tough.

38
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,460
Speaker 0: I mean we go to West Coast for packs.

39
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,600
Speaker 0: The bar for me to go to the West Coast for another convention in the same year is pretty fucking high already.

40
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:18,795
Speaker 1: He went to the other side of the world Yeah, but that was different.

41
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:19,360
Speaker 0: It was a packs.

42
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,788
Speaker 0: Also, I don't go to pack sauce every year anymore.

43
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:23,491
Speaker 1: I want to.

44
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:26,060
Speaker 0: I'll probably go next year because I skipped the last two.

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,944
Speaker 1: Maybe you will.

46
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,295
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about if I do I'm going to the coral reefs.

47
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:30,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't care.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,768
Speaker 1: I don't care if they're closed or dead.

49
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,291
Speaker 1: I'm going there.

50
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:34,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll just go in the warm waters I don't care.

51
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:36,096
Speaker 0: Okay, just go up to Brisbane.

52
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:36,660
Speaker 0: Just go swimming.

53
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:39,519
Speaker 1: Is there a tropical fishies there?

54
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:42,651
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't know.

55
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:44,140
Speaker 1: Can I see through the water to the sand?

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can see through the water to the sand pretty much everywhere.

57
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,147
Speaker 0: and the tropical thingies like when we were Like a starfish in Sydney.

58
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:55,240
Speaker 0: We went swimming and it was cold like real cold because it was winter.

59
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,307
Speaker 1: There's no jellyfish.

60
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:57,152
Speaker 1: No jellies, right?

61
00:02:57,555 --> 00:02:58,199
Speaker 1: I don't do jellies.

62
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:02,880
Speaker 0: The jellies there are way more dangerous than the jellies here and sometimes you don't worry about that.

63
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,816
Speaker 1: When I was in Israel, we went to the Red Sea and there's just jellies.

64
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:07,720
Speaker 0: Those are the chill jellies.

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,064
Speaker 1: No, they were not good.

66
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:10,830
Speaker 1: Someone got stung by them.

67
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,492
Speaker 1: They're bad.

68
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:11,954
Speaker 1: They're not like.

69
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:13,860
Speaker 1: you're dead jellies, but they're not good.

70
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:19,799
Speaker 1: And it's just like you look under the water and it looks like that fucking level in Mario 3 where it's just.

71
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,611
Speaker 1: You know I'm talking about right Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1 only horizontal.

72
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:27,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly only only horizontal instead of vertical.

73
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:29,369
Speaker 1: Right because you're looking at it from the top.

74
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,014
Speaker 1: So it was just like polka dot or you know Zippa tone, but jellies instead.

75
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:40,967
Speaker 0: Oh my god I was watching some speedrun of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1 and the that section is yeah You just take a lot of damage damage boost.

76
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:41,629
Speaker 1: Yeah.

77
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,194
Speaker 1: Yeah damage boost through life rim.

78
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:46,940
Speaker 1: I Saw the damage boost down the schema.

79
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,763
Speaker 1: You know what happens.

80
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:48,646
Speaker 0: the real life done.

81
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:49,950
Speaker 0: quick parody account.

82
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,406
Speaker 0: the one that talks about real life like it's a speedrun Finally started updating again.

83
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:55,670
Speaker 0: They were like we've read.

84
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,513
Speaker 1: I gotta follow this.

85
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:56,914
Speaker 1: What is it?

86
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:58,680
Speaker 0: We've redone the any percent route.

87
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:00,423
Speaker 0: It's you can.

88
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:04,939
Speaker 0: you can clip in front of the shuttle from the hospital instead of waiting for traffic.

89
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,273
Speaker 0: They talk about like any percent runs and 100% runs.

90
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:11,760
Speaker 0: it's a real good Twitter account.

91
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:14,329
Speaker 0: They don't tweet that often, but when they do it's always gold.

92
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:14,831
Speaker 0: Hmm.

93
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,300
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, there's a lot of gaming news.

94
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:20,939
Speaker 0: So I feel like we should cover a bunch of it, but not all of it.

95
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:24,255
Speaker 0: Probably the biggest news is the Nintendo switch.

96
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:29,878
Speaker 0: We know about it now And I don't know I'm more excited about it than I was about the Wii U.

97
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,754
Speaker 1: I Pre-ordered it because I'll tell you the reasons right?

98
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:36,803
Speaker 1: So reason number one Bomberman.

99
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:39,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, that looks real good.

100
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:43,412
Speaker 1: He's number two Bomberman that bomber.

101
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:44,600
Speaker 0: Here's what sold me on it.

102
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,300
Speaker 0: I heard oh, there's gonna be another Bomberman on the switch and I thought that could be good.

103
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,642
Speaker 0: But then I clicked on it and I noticed something eight people Gaga.

104
00:04:53,682 --> 00:05:02,560
Speaker 0: yeah, not just that but the avatars of the Bomberman's themselves Look kind of anime and like well-drawn, which I haven't seen recently.

105
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:06,113
Speaker 1: They're all you know, instead of just being the same Bomberman in eight different colors.

106
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:08,040
Speaker 1: They actually have eight different personalities, right?

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,448
Speaker 1: It's like it's you know, it's it's real Bomberman.

108
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:17,114
Speaker 1: And also I realized something it's like oh, you know When am I gonna get these eight people in my apartment to play a Bomberman right?

109
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:22,048
Speaker 1: Cuz like I have we you I got you know, I Was about to say when did you buy we?

110
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,460
Speaker 1: I didn't buy what you ever we right but it's like when you're in college.

111
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,190
Speaker 0: The GameCube party action happened so much like the GameCube was on like we played more games total on the GameCube When we were in beacon.

112
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,900
Speaker 1: the Wii party action happened so much.

113
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:46,580
Speaker 1: But as soon as I moved to New York We don't have parties at my apartment and my Wii party I have like Wii party games that have been Unplayed because we don't get people at my apartment in groups to play them counterpoint with the exception of Mario Kart.

114
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:48,399
Speaker 0: The Wii party games weren't that good.

115
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:51,631
Speaker 1: Not as good as the GameCube ones like I would put like to this.

116
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:52,555
Speaker 0: you cannot listen.

117

Speaker 0: We're gonna like the RIT like WarioWare like holy crap.

121
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:10,946
Speaker 1: Do we play that game a lot, but I realized something right this switch Unlike the Wii U right?

Speaker 0: there hasn't been a new like full-on.

154
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:48,818
Speaker 1: That's the other reason that I'm buying it because even though you know There's probably not gonna be a large quantity of games like this I have except for Majora's Mask, which I don't like even though other people like it.

155
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:57,130
Speaker 1: Every single single player real mainline You know not side bullshit Zelda game that has ever existed.

156
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,579
Speaker 1: I have beaten to completion except Majora's Mask.

157
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,060
Speaker 1: fuck that game.

158
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:07,520
Speaker 1: So of course there's gonna be one and it's on Wii U also.

159
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,403
Speaker 1: But I ain't buying that.

160
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:14,638
Speaker 0: there is also a Splatoon 2 which if like Splatoon was a game where if I had the console I would've been all over it.

161
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,487
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Splatoon is like it.

162
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:19,920
Speaker 1: I see it, and I say damn that is some legit game right there, right?

163
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,955
Speaker 1: But I'm not even playing competitive Counter-Strike.

164
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:25,240
Speaker 0: I'm not even playing Overwatch.

165
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:27,089
Speaker 1: I'm definitely not playing that right.

166
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,974
Speaker 1: so I don't got time for no FPS is or any multiplayer kind of action as it is.

167
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,600
Speaker 0: I still don't understand why you don't play over.

168
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,700
Speaker 0: What if I was released a game that was like hey Scott?

169
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,135
Speaker 0: Remember all those games you talk about being like the pinnacle of FPS thing?

170
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:43,359
Speaker 0: then we made a game That is just like those games anyway, and you're like.

171
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:54,070
Speaker 1: Yeah If I was not if I was a person who was not like a PC gaming like This would be like the glory of glory game.

172
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:59,540
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so you know what if overwatch had not come out I would have bought this just for Splatoon.

173
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,872
Speaker 1: Oh really you wouldn't see I would have you wouldn't have stayed with.

174
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,360
Speaker 1: like Rocket League or a counter-strike.

175
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,680
Speaker 0: I suck at Rocket League, and I'm too old for Rocket League like I watch Counter-Strike.

176
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:10,718
Speaker 0: Counter-Strike actually, actually NS2 I didn't.

177
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:13,708
Speaker 0: I've had weird like as much as I want to like NS2.

178
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:15,193
Speaker 1: It's partially revived.

179
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:17,460
Speaker 0: I hate to say it, but I didn't enjoy it that much.

180
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,073
Speaker 0: I couldn't stop playing it because it wasn't that fun.

181
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:19,557
Speaker 1: I like NS2.

182
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:29,170
Speaker 0: But actually I am playing Counter-Strike again, and I got to say I am bad at it But I am still way better than most people at it.

183
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,420
Speaker 0: It's I'm shocked at how good I actually am.

184
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,470
Speaker 1: That's how good I am at video games generally.

185
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,092
Speaker 1: I'm not it.

186
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:37,404
Speaker 1: I look at speedruns and I go man I'm bad at this.

187
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:46,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I see people playing Super Metroid on the speedrun It's like they beat the whole thing a hundred percent and like less than a couple like an hour and change right or like 40.

188
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,969
Speaker 1: Whatever it is 40 minutes something like that.

189
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:50,480
Speaker 0: I don't know but like still the other day our friend Judith, right?

190
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,713
Speaker 1: I play and it's like.

191
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:52,340
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

192
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:55,925
Speaker 1: I'm like I'm I'll get to the end and it'll be like 80% and I'm like.

193
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:59,040
Speaker 1: what the hell did I miss and that'll take me like all fucking day.

194
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:01,988
Speaker 0: Judith didn't really know like speedrunning was the big thing.

195
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:06,640
Speaker 0: it is like it's not super commonly known like it's only raised two million dollars.

196
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:08,428
Speaker 0: No, yeah, but it's not super kind.

197
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:10,900
Speaker 1: think about how much money how much money you raised.

198
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:19,460
Speaker 0: I'm saying it's not that it's not super well known Except for people who are kind of like in that subculture or people are like deep into gaming culture.

199
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:24,340
Speaker 0: So the other day she was like something something that Lion King game on the Genesis.

200
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,605
Speaker 0: I was real good at it and I was like Let's watch the AGD queue of it.

201
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,155
Speaker 0: and she was like I could beat the game in.

202
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:30,938
Speaker 0: I forget how many minutes.

203
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:31,741
Speaker 0: she's like n Minutes.

204
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:42,560
Speaker 0: and like I was like I played that game obsessively and then we've turned on the speedrun and her time Not that far away from the AGD queue like close to the world record time, right?

205
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,417
Speaker 1: I mean if you play a game quickly and some games have glitches you might not know about.

206
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:48,180
Speaker 0: Oh, she knew about.

207
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:53,072
Speaker 0: There's a section that came up and she's like, oh man You can actually one-shot those guys if you like.

208
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,620
Speaker 0: blah blah blah blah blah with the timing.

209
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:57,010
Speaker 1: I'm talking glitches.

210
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:05,486
Speaker 1: like you know I can super Metroid the big glitch like if you ever watch super Metroid speedrun no matter pretty much no matter what percentage it is There's no like you can like wall job.

211
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:09,440
Speaker 1: No, there's this part where they know, you know the green the first sort of boss.

212
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,806
Speaker 1: You fight the green plant thing.

213
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:14,280
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, then no one ever fights that you never even see that section of the map.

214
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,280
Speaker 1: They never go there except for the 100% map category where you have to reveal the whole map.

215
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:24,500
Speaker 1: And the reason is because this is room where these, you know, little things come down from the ceiling.

216
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,385
Speaker 1: It's like tick tick tick tick.

217
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:27,639
Speaker 1: and then they're closed and you can only open them from the other side.

218
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:34,373
Speaker 1: But you can use a technique called the mock ball To like get through them and go through when you're not supposed to go through that.

219
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that you skip that whole area.

220
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:43,260
Speaker 1: And it's like if you don't know that it's like you would only know that from like either a you're the person who discovered it.

221
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,330
Speaker 1: Or be you went and research speedrun shit.

222
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:57,839
Speaker 1: Like I've tried to get through those Like the way it's designed you sort of have this natural inclination because you enter the room and these things are closing like tick tick Tick tick and it's like you feel like you can get under there.

223
00:11:58,621 --> 00:11:59,924
Speaker 1: It's just everyone who plays.

224
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:06,678
Speaker 1: it has this natural thing where they try to do it and then you can't because there's a second one You can't make it through that one.

225
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:10,539
Speaker 1: But the speedrunners know the trick to get through and if you practice you can do the trick, too.

226
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,643
Speaker 1: It's not impossibly hard.

227
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:12,486
Speaker 1: I've done it once.

228
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:17,140
Speaker 1: No, but they do it exactly right every single time.

229
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:18,737
Speaker 1: It's like holy shit.

230
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:23,456
Speaker 0: So in other news a GDQ, of course is happening or happened.

231
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,935
Speaker 0: by the time you listen to this It's done and it was the biggest one ever.

232
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:31,545
Speaker 0: Yep Uh, it made the news for a bunch of reasons but I kind of want to highlight the fact.

233
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:39,660
Speaker 0: a few things happened and this has happened more and more recently where AGDQ they will ban people from being on the streams.

234
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:42,408
Speaker 1: Yeah, AGDQ has really good policies.

235
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:51,275
Speaker 1: I'm like, you know, it's one of the good conventions like really good anti-harassment Whatever ex mag fest, you know all the good things that we support right?

236
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,680
Speaker 1: They have the good policies.

237
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:59,440
Speaker 1: they don't stand for your bullshit and Even more so than the other ones they can't afford to stand for your bullshit, right?

238
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:12,920
Speaker 1: Because whichever charity they're supporting whether it's prevent cancer foundation or doctors without borders who they support during the summer is Watching and they're seeing someone on the stream like swearing and giving a bad image.

239
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,577
Speaker 1: It's like we can't have that, you know charity is like nope.

240
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:29,560
Speaker 0: So the news specifically I mean penny arcade had that problem where the child's play charity Couldn't get a statue and public at a public place because someone who is approving that statue Looked up what penny arcade was and read a few strips, right?

241
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,655
Speaker 1: So the prevent cancer foundation would be very very unhappy if they saw some assholes on the stream.

242
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:39,719
Speaker 1: so they can't have you there You know and that's the end of it.

243
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,168
Speaker 1: So probably that's good because that's just like.

244
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,640
Speaker 1: that's a convenient excuse for enforcing policies that you should have.

245
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,585
Speaker 1: Anyway, which is up.

246
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:48,194
Speaker 1: This is for speedrunning.

247
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:49,200
Speaker 1: No assholes allowed.

248
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,729
Speaker 0: So they made the news.

249
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:53,382
Speaker 0: the biggest one during this AGDQ.

250
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:58,820
Speaker 0: was they banned a dude for busting out a make America great again Trump hat on the stream?

251
00:13:59,161 --> 00:13:59,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, can't have that.

252
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:02,671
Speaker 0: and the guy like got mad.

253
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:03,132
Speaker 1: Of course.

254
00:14:03,153 --> 00:14:03,895
Speaker 1: He's a mad guy.

255
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:05,728
Speaker 1: Well, so you wearing that hat if you're not mad Yep.

256
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:13,449
Speaker 0: so they basically he got banned dude went crazy and tried to get his legion of like shitlord trolls to go after AGDQ and Like boycott them and demand an apology.

257
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:15,800
Speaker 1: Yes, that will put you in the good graces of humanity.

258
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:17,005
Speaker 1: Supporting cancer.

259
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,340
Speaker 1: if you're against AGDQ, you're for cancer, which means you are cancer.

260
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:24,591
Speaker 0: So you can read the story of like this dude if you care about you're.

261
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:24,852
Speaker 0: either.

262
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:25,614
Speaker 1: you're either for.

263
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:30,173
Speaker 1: if you're against AGDQ That means you either a must want to play games slowly.

264
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:34,740
Speaker 1: Yeah Or games done badly or be you want people.

265
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:44,380
Speaker 0: So, you know shitty flute will start shitty games done badly and it's just cringy terrible streams of people playing games badly.

266
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,378
Speaker 1: That's my museum You know.

267
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:57,639
Speaker 0: Anyway, but the two points about this one if you run a convention and you have a good harassment policy Just stick by your guns.

268
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,824
Speaker 0: Like don't take right.

269
00:14:58,844 --> 00:14:58,944
Speaker 0: like.

270
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:04,552
Speaker 1: if someone mouths off to the point of the harassment policy if you don't stick to it It might as well not exist.

271
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:12,163
Speaker 0: There's someone really Enforce it like a recording supposedly of like the dude getting banned and they're like look Here's your warning.

272
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:16,881
Speaker 0: you people are causing a problem and they start to mouth off at the staff and the guys like, you know What?

273
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:18,591
Speaker 0: nope, it's over.

274
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:19,536
Speaker 0: Give me all your badges.

275
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:20,240
Speaker 0: This is done

276
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:20,842
Speaker 1: You're done

277
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:24,017
Speaker 0: and that is the right way to do things at conventions because it's done

278
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:24,399
Speaker 1: son

279
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:36,880
Speaker 0: Staff a lot of conventions and all I want to say is that kind of crap happens all the time at every convention And if you mouth off to the staff, they'll just take your badge.

280
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:43,938
Speaker 0: In fact, if they don't just take your badge Usually that means that conventions not that well run and you basically have a license to raise.

281
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:44,480
Speaker 0: holy hell.

282
00:15:44,863 --> 00:15:46,152
Speaker 0: So a GDQ props to you.

283
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:50,550
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm The other news that came out there was actually pretty interesting.

284
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:58,233
Speaker 0: I saw boot disks all over my Twitter One day and I was like, why are people talking about boot disks?

285
00:15:58,334 --> 00:15:59,297
Speaker 1: So people don't know this.

286
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,691
Speaker 1: right back in the day Let's say you're running a computer with Windows 2.1 and Windows 95 usually 3.1, right?

287
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:06,104
Speaker 1: And you want to play a game.

288
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:21,439
Speaker 1: say I did this for Mac or your - yep and here's for do my computer at that time I upgraded it later and I didn't need to do this anymore, but it only had eight megabytes Eight megabytes of RAM.

289
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,736
Speaker 1: Nowadays, I have 32 gigabytes, but then I had eight gigabytes.

290
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:43,722
Speaker 1: when I upgraded it It was 16 But I had eight megabytes of RAM and a 486 and I want to play Mac or your - and Mac or your - would work If you had eight megabytes of RAM, but you would use a lot of that RAM and it would in fact Often need to swap which means when it filled up the RAM it would say All right.

291
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:46,352
Speaker 1: Well the thing I need in RAM right now won't fit.

292
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:48,744
Speaker 1: I'll take some of the stuff in RAM right now I don't need.

293
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:50,175
Speaker 1: put it back in the hard drive.

294
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,440
Speaker 1: take the stuff I need from the hard drive put it back in the RAM.

295
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,032
Speaker 0: Oh, but back then hard drives were slow even slower than they are now.

296
00:16:57,092 --> 00:17:04,516
Speaker 1: like you would be amazed at how hard drives That's what's known as swapping it still happens today on modern computers when they run out of RAM.

297
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:08,099
Speaker 0: and but when it happens Unless you turn that off and then your computer will just crash right?

298
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,090
Speaker 1: But when it happens like you'll notice why is my computer so slow?

299
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:21,656
Speaker 1: think about how slow it was when it happened back in the day with eight megabytes of RAM, so What you could do to avoid or alleviate this problem was saying, okay Look, here's what I'm gonna do.

300
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,405
Speaker 1: I turn the computer on.

301
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:24,749
Speaker 1: what's in the RAM?

302
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:28,359
Speaker 1: when I turn the computer on basically nothing like the iOS bootstrap, right?

303
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,380
Speaker 1: Well, the operating system is in the RAM right and then you know Windows started.

304
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,280
Speaker 1: So Windows 3.1 is in the RAM and then like my mouse drive thing is in the RAM.

305
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,131
Speaker 1: It's like there's a certain list of things that are in the RAM.

306
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,620
Speaker 1: when your computer just turns on right?

307
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:51,266
Speaker 1: You would make a boot disk that would say alright Look instead of booting from the hard drive boot from this disk and this disk Well has very specific boot instructions.

308
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:58,218
Speaker 0: So when the computer turns on It'll be like The sound card driver.

309
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:05,299
Speaker 1: all of only the things you need are in the RAM and no extra stuffs like Windows won't load and Extra drivers won't.

310
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:22,650
Speaker 1: anything you don't need To play the game will not be in the RAM and then you launch the game from the boot disk even though it's on the hard drive and then You have the maximum amount available RAM free for the game to use and nothing else taking up space there.

311
00:18:22,991 --> 00:18:36,370
Speaker 1: That would be making your game run slower and a lot of times you could not get a game to run unless you used a boot Disk, so next time I computer I literally had this like library of boot disks tuned for each particular game that I owned.

312
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,738
Speaker 0: Yeah I would literally because computers didn't go to sleep.

313
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:44,990
Speaker 1: you put that you put the disk in for the game and you turn the computer Ah, this wasn't like Apple to where the game was literally on the disk.

314
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:48,530
Speaker 1: The game was on your hard drive or on a CD ROM or something or on both?

315
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:54,367
Speaker 1: but you put the floppy disk in and boot off of it and then it would launch the game from the CD ROM.

316
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:54,849
Speaker 1: slash hard.

317
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:55,110
Speaker 1: now

318
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:06,003
Speaker 0: if You were either way more hardcore or you didn't like you knew how to do this But you didn't understand how to make a boot disk You can hold that five when a computer booted and you get DOS with nothing

319
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:07,910
Speaker 1: and you could just type in the same command.

320
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:21,914
Speaker 0: I would type high mem and mem maker But that's the reasons for that or even more and if the game didn't have mouse support you wouldn't type mouse But if it did I type mouse dot exe yeah, which would load a basic mouse driver Like.

321
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:25,910
Speaker 0: so in the modern era like that does not really exist anymore.

322
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:36,344
Speaker 1: No Cuz your computer is so powerful and I have 32 gigabytes of RAM and even though that's a ridiculous Well, it's not a ridiculous amount 64 is ridiculous, but 32.

323
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:37,951
Speaker 1: I've never filled up 32.

324
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:46,781
Speaker 1: I can launch two virtual machines and a triple-a video game and Windows dude Adobe Premiere On this new computer.

325
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:48,148
Speaker 0: I was trained to be him.

326
00:19:48,751 --> 00:20:02,970
Speaker 0: I was transcoding all of shoujo kakamei utenna from the blu-ray like ultra rip masters and a couple web browsers and Simultaneously, I was playing overwatch and my computer gave zero fucks except it made the room hotter.

327
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:05,270
Speaker 0: I was only using 12 gigs of that Ram.

328
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:08,621
Speaker 1: However, when you do this Ram is not the issue.

329
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:10,908
Speaker 1: Ram filling up is not the problem on a modern computer.

330
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:22,570
Speaker 1: the problem on the Computer especially if you don't have a super powerful one is Even if you've got multiple cores very often all these things running simultaneously are competing for CPU cycles.

331
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:23,895
Speaker 0: Right, you have a browser window.

332
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:24,236
Speaker 0: We got

333
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:38,082
Speaker 1: a browser open in the background and let's say it's got Google Hangouts in your email in it occasionally some of your CPU cycles are going to be it's gonna stop rendering your game for like a fraction of a second and Check your email and then start, you know working on your game again.

334
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:39,187
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'll get interrupts.

335
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:39,790
Speaker 0: stuff will happen.

336
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:42,668
Speaker 0: Now if you have a really fast computer, this probably doesn't matter.

337
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:43,713
Speaker 1: like you Like.

338
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:44,997
Speaker 0: I have four cores.

339
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:45,318
Speaker 0: You know what?

340
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:49,030
Speaker 0: Most people don't buy an i7 don't have four cores with hyper threading, right?

341
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:58,082
Speaker 1: but so maybe you're in a situation like eSports where it's like you really Cannot even even like the couple frames would be like a disaster.

342
00:20:58,363 --> 00:21:05,630
Speaker 1: or you got a weak computer and you want to get every last Ounce of power out of it and dedicate it fully to the game that you're playing and nothing else.

343
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:10,063
Speaker 1: So Windows is 10 is adding game mode to which is basically boot disk.

344
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,354
Speaker 1: you boot into game mode and it's like, alright I'm Windows 10.

345
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:16,087
Speaker 1: I've booted with the bare minimum stuff needed to play your game.

346
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:16,670
Speaker 1: It's a little bit.

347
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,775
Speaker 1: I got your video driver.

348
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:18,759
Speaker 1: I got your sound driver.

349
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,040
Speaker 1: I got what.

350
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:19,804
Speaker 0: it's a little better than.

351
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:31,250
Speaker 0: it's not actually a boot It's a put the computer in game mode and it Suppresses all the things that could draw resources that are not needed to run the executable that you just ran, right?

352
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:36,814
Speaker 1: It's like alright, we're not gonna be checking for Windows updates We're not gonna be checking your email We're not gonna be doing nothing.

353
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:43,842
Speaker 1: you run your steam game and we are going to dedicate all the CPU cycles we can To doing that and nothing else.

354
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:51,837
Speaker 0: it appears that it On one hand it does all the stuff that an ultra nerd would do to do this on their own like I could Do stuff to a computer.

355
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:59,082
Speaker 1: I could just open up the task manager and end every single task Like oh, I'm gonna turn off my you know iTunes iPhone support service.

356
00:21:59,122 --> 00:21:59,824
Speaker 0: We're not even just that.

357
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:11,669
Speaker 0: you can reprioritize threads Nice in them and all that start on nice thing the very nice, you know God does anyone who listens to the Tuesday geek nights know what re nice does me other than you don't listen to geek nights.

358
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:19,643
Speaker 0: But there's hints that this might also Be able like if you make a game the game might be able to tell.

359
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:23,810
Speaker 0: like use this as a function To tell it what it needs or doesn't need right?

360
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,617
Speaker 1: The thing is you don't.

361
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:28,502
Speaker 1: this is not something you want to do without telling the user that it's happening.

362
00:22:28,562 --> 00:22:31,595
Speaker 1: because like you don't just want to say like Program your games to where.

363
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:34,045
Speaker 1: every time someone starts it your computer enters game mode.

364
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:36,235
Speaker 1: because then well, okay Someone did it.

365
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:37,842
Speaker 1: and now there's Spotify.

366
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:39,831
Speaker 1: music stops playing and they're like what the fuck It's.

367
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:43,602
Speaker 0: a look at Spotify music Xbox bars like one more thing here.

368
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:47,052
Speaker 0: Like you're in game mode and you're streaming and whatever Mm-hmm.

369
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,382
Speaker 0: It's a lot like your phone like my phone will go into.

370
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:50,306
Speaker 0: yeah dog.

371
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:51,250
Speaker 0: Your battery's almost dead.

372
00:22:51,351 --> 00:22:53,768
Speaker 0: So we're gonna turn off like everything we can just to save you.

373
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:58,228
Speaker 1: now You might think it's like well how much extra performance am I really gonna get out of this?

374
00:22:58,309 --> 00:22:58,570
Speaker 1: Well?

375
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:06,467
Speaker 1: Consider like the power of like an Xbox one or a ps4 Compared to like a computer with the Nvidia 1080.

376
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:07,170
Speaker 1: It's not even close.

377
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,063
Speaker 1: The 1080 is like multiple times more powerful like than the console.

378
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,976
Speaker 1: consoles are weak as hell yet They get such great performance out of them.

379
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:17,302
Speaker 1: Why cuz they're not doing anything fucking else.

380
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,024
Speaker 0: Yep, right?

381
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:22,810
Speaker 1: Well, so they're only rendering 1080p I'm just saying but I mean even at 1080p right you're good.

382
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,904
Speaker 1: They're getting much more incredible performance than your PC games are per hardware.

383
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:35,506
Speaker 1: right in terms of efficiency right of You know resulting graphics and frames per amount of hardware, right?

384
00:23:35,526 --> 00:23:51,150
Speaker 1: So you're gonna be able to get drastic support theoretically hypothetically drastic efficiency Performance improvements if you use this game mode, you know, yep I really want to see some benchmarks like how many frames you get in game mode versus not game mode.

385
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:58,050
Speaker 0: So last and probably least but this was making the rounds - there's this dude you can read about his story.

386
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,795
Speaker 1: You can just like tell him looking at him.

387
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:01,180
Speaker 1: This guy is a piece of shit.

388
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,604
Speaker 0: He's a professional baby.

389
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:10,630
Speaker 0: He's a bad person, but so This guy it appears to be the most toxic League of Legends player on earth.

390
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:19,958
Speaker 1: well, you know on the one hand he doesn't seem to be like actually a Racist or I mean he's about that line.

391
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:23,410
Speaker 1: He might be right but it's you know, that's not his problem, right?

392
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,115
Speaker 1: So he's not like.

393
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:27,809
Speaker 1: he's not like an actual KKK member as far as we know.

394
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:33,190
Speaker 0: He's basically a guy who wants to play this one character and he only plays one character.

395
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,472
Speaker 1: It's not.

396
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:37,051
Speaker 1: it's not a good character from either from what I hear and he's good at this character Like.

397
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:38,950
Speaker 0: he's really the only human on earth is good at this character.

398
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,183
Speaker 1: I'd be like if you're playing Street Fighter and you played Dan and you won.

399
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:45,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you only played Dan Yep, you didn't play guile.

400
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:45,888
Speaker 1: You didn't play ryu.

401
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:57,268
Speaker 0: You just bought bought bought and played Dan, but you were so good at it You kept winning with it, but imagine if in addition to that Let's say that you could ban characters like you can in MOBAs, right?

402
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:57,730
Speaker 1: It's a mobile.

403
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:04,294
Speaker 0: So yeah, you bet you've you draft and ban characters every time you play and let's say the other teams like oh, it's that guy Let's ban Dan.

404
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:05,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

405
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:07,950
Speaker 1: He's only knows how to play Dan and he's super dangerous with it.

406
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:10,269
Speaker 1: Well ban Dan because we see him on the other team.

407
00:25:10,531 --> 00:25:12,601
Speaker 1: He'll have to use guile or something and then we'll win.

408
00:25:12,782 --> 00:25:25,261
Speaker 0: if he can't play Dan he freaks out and basically flips the table and goes apeshit on everybody ruins the game and Is like does the ultra mega finger up rage?

409
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:27,188
Speaker 0: quit like he sounds horrible.

410
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:31,830
Speaker 1: So on the one hand, it's like wow such incredible skills.

411
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:33,310
Speaker 1: That is like amazing to behold.

412
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,518
Speaker 1: This guy is so good with this shitty character.

413
00:25:35,538 --> 00:25:40,013
Speaker 1: if he just dedicated himself to like the good characters or like learn how to play Multiple characters.

414
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:41,739
Speaker 1: How good would he be?

415
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:42,602
Speaker 1: Like holy shit.

416
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,950
Speaker 1: He could be like the god of gods, right?

417
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:51,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the Wayne Gretzky of law, but he's not but he is incapable of interacting with other human beings.

418
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,241
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's basically a three-year-old baby.

419
00:25:53,321 --> 00:26:00,110
Speaker 1: Otherwise except for this one skill He is a savant in this one extremely narrow area and otherwise a baby.

420
00:26:00,371 --> 00:26:06,330
Speaker 0: So his behavior was so egregious that riot banned him for life from competitive play, right?

421
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:19,270
Speaker 1: I mean you couldn't want him on your pro team anyway, even if he's so good at this character because you're never gonna he's never gonna need to play that character and To be a pro player at these games need to be able to fulfill multiple roles, right?

422
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,585
Speaker 1: And that's like having someone on your hockey team who all they can do is shoot.

423
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:27,158
Speaker 1: They can't play defense They can't do you know for check.

424
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:27,981
Speaker 1: they can't do anything.

425
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:28,743
Speaker 1: all they can do is shoot.

426
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:36,728
Speaker 1: So they just stand in one spot uselessly But if they get the puck they'll shoot and maybe in very likely it's like it's a useless person.

427
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:37,250
Speaker 1: you don't want them.

428
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:45,650
Speaker 0: so in response to this the dude keeps making new accounts and Rising through the ranks until they eventually figure out it's him and ban him again.

429
00:26:46,193 --> 00:26:49,150
Speaker 0: And he made a YouTube persona around his toxic behavior.

430
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:52,463
Speaker 0: So now he's kind of more and he's popping.

431
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:56,483
Speaker 1: He's popular with the douchebags So hopefully the other people get banned right?

432
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:57,910
Speaker 1: He's popular with the other douchebags.

433
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:05,349
Speaker 1: He's like the king of the shitholes Yeah, and all the other shit lords like watching him and are like cheering for him and he gets monies from them.

434
00:27:06,313 --> 00:27:25,441
Speaker 0: So this article on polygon and this is kind of why I bring it up The argument seems to be that because he's so popular and banning him didn't actually reduce the toxicity of the game They should unban him and like try to reform or whatever and I say no I say just keep banning him like whack-a-mole.

435
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:27,110
Speaker 0: his career will eventually fade.

436
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:34,450
Speaker 1: This is why I keep saying right and everyone keeps telling me this idea is no good But this idea is going to be tried at some point.

437
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,457
Speaker 0: Well, I see sports get professionalized.

438
00:27:36,497 --> 00:27:38,344
Speaker 0: this will happen in the professional circuits.

439
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:42,843
Speaker 1: Sure, but once they draw salaries Oh, yeah, then you get suspensions and whatever like $10,000.

440
00:27:42,843 --> 00:27:44,592
Speaker 0: fine Well,

441
00:27:44,652 --> 00:27:56,112
Speaker 1: you know, but what is going to happen is someone needs to make a mode in the game That's serious mode and you join serious mode opt into it and you agree that this is serious mode And you put

442
00:27:56,112 --> 00:27:57,459
Speaker 0: $100 in escrow

443
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:02,410
Speaker 1: and if you fuck around in serious mode You don't just get banned and then have to make a new account.

444
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:07,084
Speaker 1: There are real-world consequences for fucking around in serious mode, right?

445
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:09,230
Speaker 1: You know, you fucked around in serious mode.

446
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,557
Speaker 1: We're gonna take $1,000 from you.

447
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:13,170
Speaker 1: Oh, you fucked around in serious mode.

448
00:28:13,511 --> 00:28:18,390
Speaker 1: I guess we're gonna you know, give you some other real-world penalty like oh, we're gonna put you in jail.

449
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:21,218
Speaker 0: Someone shows up your door just smashes your computer.

450
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:24,167
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it could be all sorts of yo.

451
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:27,464
Speaker 1: you use cheat codes All right, I guess you know, we have your house now.

452
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:29,533
Speaker 1: Good job There will be.

453
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:37,621
Speaker 1: someone will set up a thing where there are real-world consequences for fucking around and being a shithole and then people like this can actually be punished.

454
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:47,710
Speaker 0: my buried lead here is that MOBAs just engender the most talks like as much as I run into the occasional toxic person in overwatch or even by God counter-strike.

455
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,357
Speaker 0: MOBAs are unique.

456
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,950
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, well look it's a game where you got all these character.

457
00:28:52,311 --> 00:28:59,750
Speaker 1: The fact that they can ban his character from being played right that that's even a thing creates this situation in the first place.

458
00:28:59,811 --> 00:29:06,205
Speaker 1: Yeah, right You know the fact that there's all these characters to choose from and you can specialize in just one of them.

459
00:29:06,225 --> 00:29:07,810
Speaker 0: streaming community the ladders.

460
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:08,196
Speaker 0: It's like.

461
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:13,689
Speaker 0: this article encapsulates a perfect storm of all these factors around MOBAs that lead to the fact that

462
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:27,078
Speaker 1: Player the fact that he can play solo queuing right which is basically saying I'm all by myself put me on a team Right versus having to have a team at that high level of competition We're like at the highest end of the ladder Like I would make it where it's like.

463
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:28,324
Speaker 1: oh you're at that top of the ladder.

464
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:29,550
Speaker 1: You have to be on a team.

465
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,214
Speaker 1: You can't just solo queue up there.

466
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:32,878
Speaker 1: All right, that wouldn't happen.

467
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:39,608
Speaker 0: So you can enjoy this fascinating story of this baby guy and Decide what you will.

468
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:50,941
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the day Lemma smash.

469
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:53,470
Speaker 0: so Emily and I we were in Australia.

470
00:29:53,611 --> 00:29:59,155
Speaker 0: One of the funny things we encountered was we were hiking and off in this like little side area We see what looks like like.

471
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:01,910
Speaker 0: it looks like a net like a plastic net some garbage.

472
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:04,690
Speaker 0: It's like this checkerboard of blue plastic.

473
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,960
Speaker 0: but then as we walk over like ah someone left some garbage.

474
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,070
Speaker 0: here we see this little guy a little bird a bower bird and He starts dancing for us and we realize the bower birds.

475
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:27,503
Speaker 0: they're a kind of bird where the males will make little houses and Decorate them with colored bits to try to attract mates and the mates Basically evaluate them based on how good their bower bird art is.

476
00:30:27,684 --> 00:30:27,885
Speaker 1: man.

477
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:30,234
Speaker 1: I'll be so good at being that burden Like.

478
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:32,744
Speaker 1: I want to be that kind of bird to be like you want blue.

479
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,948
Speaker 1: I'd have all the ladies in my house Hey girl, blue and yellow.

480
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:41,510
Speaker 1: So apparently they blue is now see this is my trick is I would be all green.

481
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:43,889
Speaker 1: I'd have like all this green arts everywhere one blue.

482
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,030
Speaker 1: Well blue and yellow is okay because that combines to make green, right?

483
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:54,935
Speaker 1: I'd have green and blue yellow which is green and if the if the lady bird doesn't want my green arts I'd be like, I don't want you.

484
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:55,838
Speaker 1: Anyway, you don't like green.

485
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:59,030
Speaker 1: So I'll wait for the one who likes green to come along.

486
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,179
Speaker 1: So apparently the green is the best.

487
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:01,842
Speaker 1: there would be plenty.

488
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:08,729
Speaker 0: the females tend to prefer Blue like a certain shade of blue like if that's arranged symmetrically they like it the most.

489
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:16,918
Speaker 0: But young male bower birds can't see blue until they get older So they won't know if it's blue or not.

490
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:19,930
Speaker 0: then they get older and they're like, oh I get it blue.

491
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:26,850
Speaker 0: We got this and the shade of blue they like happens to be that blue of like water bottle bottle caps.

492
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:29,889
Speaker 0: So they go like stealing bottle caps to arrange.

493
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:37,184
Speaker 1: We should take like a whole sack of them and just make a barber like yo dog Got you and go out where the birds are and just like dump them out.

494
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:38,610
Speaker 0: Well, you're like the wingman.

495
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,579
Speaker 0: Well wingman, you're their wingman.

496
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,050
Speaker 1: I mean people really like, you know human beings.

497
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,570
Speaker 1: They tend to really like that, you know, the gold color, right?

498
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,313
Speaker 1: They're like old.

499
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:50,270
Speaker 1: it'd be like you're going up to a homeless prison and dump it out a bunch of gold.

500
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:51,230
Speaker 0: Here's a better skit.

501
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,234
Speaker 0: Here's your comedy skit.

502
00:31:52,495 --> 00:32:03,778
Speaker 0: you go you go out to like the middle of a bar like this would be it like something that like I don't know Upright citizens brigade would do and you go to a bar like you're gonna pick up some ladies and you start dumping blue garbage all Over the ground and spreading it around.

503
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:06,030
Speaker 0: then you stand there like check it out blue.

504
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, but people would have to know about bower birds for that to be funny.

505
00:32:08,871 --> 00:32:12,267
Speaker 0: Well, then you video it and it's funny when it doesn't work and then it does work.

506
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,238
Speaker 1: suddenly Oh, this is bower bird girl comes in.

507
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:19,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's like, hey, she's like forgot an Audubon Society members.

508
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got any yellow to go with that blue.

509
00:32:21,685 --> 00:32:25,154
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah So you got a thing of the day?

510
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:32,253
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Chad these dudes I assume they're somewhere in the UK because they talk like it and They bikin.

511
00:32:32,775 --> 00:32:36,830
Speaker 1: cuz they're like us they bikin and they're biking somewhere with his farms.

512
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:41,689
Speaker 1: All right, and farms tend to be surrounded by electric fences to keep the cows in.

513
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:49,814
Speaker 0: Yep, I as a kid I was I knew what electric fences looked up like and after I encountered if you're not the high-quality Jail kind of electric.

514
00:32:49,854 --> 00:32:58,266
Speaker 0: Yeah, not the Jurassic Park the kind where it's like three shitty wires that are electrified somehow The ones that like ground to the earth, right?

515
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:00,813
Speaker 1: So they didn't realize it.

516
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:02,136
Speaker 1: but you know, they.

517
00:33:02,376 --> 00:33:12,730
Speaker 1: they stopped for a bit to have a little rest and One of the guys accidentally unknowingly leaned his bike up against the electric fence Like it is stuck on that fence.

518
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,170
Speaker 1: It's not just leaned on it where he could like kick it and it would fall over and no longer be touching the fence.

519
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:26,610
Speaker 1: It's got like one wheel on one side of the fence and one wheel on the other side of the fence And the fence is touching the frame and I guess it's conducting.

520
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:31,548
Speaker 1: They have a jolly old time getting that bike off that fence.

521
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:37,170
Speaker 0: in this funny I like how they keep thinking like if I just grab it quickly, I'll be fine and then they're not fine.

522
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:45,137
Speaker 1: I want to know why they didn't just find the owner of the electric fence and tell them to turn it off temporarily or Find the wire power.

523
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:45,679
Speaker 1: It's not like.

524
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,990
Speaker 1: it's not an electric fence that can keep people out, right?

525
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,537
Speaker 0: It's probably like the humans away.

526
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:51,447
Speaker 0: It's probably like around the property.

527
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:55,702
Speaker 1: I'm just saying This is a fence that is easy for humans to get over.

528
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,525
Speaker 1: they get over it.

529
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:57,890
Speaker 1: No problem whatsoever, right?

530
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:07,390
Speaker 1: It's not a human proof fence They can find like, you know, they can cut the power to it somehow With what do you carry like wire cutters with you insulated wire cutters.

531
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,876
Speaker 1: I'm just saying there's another bright better solution than what owners Are we like a mile away or not?

532
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:13,619
Speaker 0: Even home like.

533
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:22,105
Speaker 1: but the solution they came up with is way more entertaining for us Yep, so especially because short stick still conducts electricity.

534
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:31,650
Speaker 1: Okay, I Think the power on this fence was turned way up because the electric fences I've encountered using the same design Doesn't the voltage have not been that powerful in my experience.

535
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:37,279
Speaker 0: Also, I thought when I watched the video I was like yo dog Why you not carbon fiber?

536
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,790
Speaker 0: and then I learned carbon fiber fucking conducts electricity.

537
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:42,090
Speaker 1: I did not know that carbon fiber is awesome.

538
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,672
Speaker 0: Do not know?

539
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:46,746
Speaker 0: carbon fiber conducts electricity well enough to where you will get shocked.

540
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:52,588
Speaker 0: Watch out I even found a YouTube video where someone's like so in case you thought also it's a fat bike.

541
00:34:52,768 --> 00:34:54,629
Speaker 1: fat bikes Usually aren't carbon fiber.

542
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:55,733
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess they could be.

543
00:34:55,753 --> 00:35:00,550
Speaker 0: there's no reason a lot of mountain bikes because you don't carry about the weight as much as the durability.

544
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:00,832
Speaker 0: Like.

545
00:35:01,296 --> 00:35:02,748
Speaker 0: I'll use mountain bikes with steel, too.

546
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:06,003
Speaker 1: Well, if it's it depends if it's uphill or downhill.

547
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,570
Speaker 1: if you're going uphill the weight is the price.

548
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,205
Speaker 0: So I gotta say the last time I went mountain biking.

549
00:35:10,346 --> 00:35:14,549
Speaker 0: I rode this like $15,000 all carbon like crazy-ass mountain bike.

550
00:35:15,576 --> 00:35:17,530
Speaker 0: The more expensive mountain bike is clearly superior.

551
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:19,474
Speaker 1: Everything is a barrier.

552
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:22,222
Speaker 1: Holy have you ever seen a more expensive something?

553
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:28,264
Speaker 0: It's got that mountain bike Wade Similarly to your fancy speed bike.

554
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:29,530
Speaker 1: My bike isn't that fancy?

555
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:31,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, but holy shit that mountain bike.

556
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:42,150
Speaker 0: Anyway in the meta moment we were at magfest We did six panels and I think they're all already on loot at YouTube because magfest just records the panels.

557
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,256
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna find out about that.

558
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,387
Speaker 1: I haven't seen magfest ever upload anything.

559
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:45,950
Speaker 0: They're all up there.

560
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:50,590
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm gonna go and find all the video of panels that we didn't video ourselves and just start like linking to them.

561
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see if it's there.

562
00:35:52,395 --> 00:35:58,010
Speaker 0: but we are doing one panel at Pac South which is in like a couple weeks.

563
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,744
Speaker 0: Grind mechanics in games an updated version of our grinding panel on Friday.

564
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:04,888
Speaker 1: Why do keep doing the same pan?

565
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:12,021
Speaker 0: I Submitted this panel, but I told them yo if you want a second or third panel from us We will happily do this updated version.

566
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:15,216
Speaker 1: I thought Pac South was desperate for panels But why will we know one?

567
00:36:15,597 --> 00:36:19,111
Speaker 0: I also submitted what I think is our best new panel the quitting panel Like.

568
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:20,678
Speaker 0: I really like our quitting panel a lot.

569
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:23,329
Speaker 0: quitting panels good and we already practiced it at magfest.

570
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,749
Speaker 0: now We got like the hyped up version and I was like, but really this is the one we want to do.

571
00:36:28,232 --> 00:36:31,710
Speaker 0: And they were like, yeah, that's well and good, but we actually want you to do the grind one specifically.

572
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:35,176
Speaker 0: So we're doing the grind one 4 p.m Friday in the cactus theater.

573
00:36:35,256 --> 00:36:38,190
Speaker 1: wonder if we just only submitted the quitting one where they reject us entirely.

574
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:45,415
Speaker 0: I only submitted that at first but then I added more and said yo if you need more panels because I know they extended the Panel deadline.

575
00:36:45,576 --> 00:36:47,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, then they're like, oh actually we want that grinding one.

576
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,990
Speaker 0: So and at PAX East we are also doing a panel.

577
00:36:52,313 --> 00:37:00,874
Speaker 0: So I submitted the quitting one to PAX East But I also submitted play dirty to win because we used to have this panel a long time ago called how to win at games And it was good.

578
00:37:01,496 --> 00:37:02,300
Speaker 0: And actually like.

579
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,690
Speaker 1: we just want to do it again, but you can't you do it again.

580
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,270
Speaker 1: So you just made a new name same thing.

581
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,297
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm making all new slides.

582
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:13,579
Speaker 0: just because modern era like there's more better techniques to win Like it's we can update that panel a lot.

583
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,746
Speaker 0: We did that pen a long time ago.

584
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:18,509
Speaker 0: Talk about football Yeah talking about basketball in the granny shot.

585
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:24,450
Speaker 0: So it's an all-new version of that panel and of course they picked that one instead of quitting.

586
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,139
Speaker 0: So that's the one we're doing a paxies.

587
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,144
Speaker 0: Maybe we don't like.

588
00:37:27,225 --> 00:37:28,210
Speaker 1: they don't like quitting I guess.

589
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,670
Speaker 0: Oh, well, at least we did it at magfest.

590
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:37,492
Speaker 0: So I'll be uploading that as soon as I get a chance to edit it, but and the geek nights book club book is still Rebecca.

591
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:38,296
Speaker 1: I finished reading it.

592
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:41,310
Speaker 0: We are doing the show on it this week on Thursday.

593
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:49,670
Speaker 0: So finish Rebecca so you can listen to the spoiler full Episode about Rebecca that we were doing on Thursday or read it sometime in your life and then come back.

594
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,255
Speaker 0: Yeah, you should read this book.

595
00:37:51,295 --> 00:37:51,877
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

596
00:37:51,977 --> 00:37:55,930
Speaker 0: And actually it'll probably really color your perception of the movie Rebecca.

597
00:37:56,672 --> 00:38:06,490
Speaker 0: Yep, and if you haven't seen the movie Rebecca At least watch that movie even if you don't read the book I mean, it's one of those cases where it's like, you know, the movie definitely doesn't replace the book.

598
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,990
Speaker 1: It never does but it's one of those ones where it's like.

599
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,507
Speaker 1: Oh, that's actually a good movie and not just some like movie based on the book.

600
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:18,446
Speaker 1: That's not good Yep, but I have a very just don't try to write your book report from the movie cuz it'll be wrong.

601
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:36,755
Speaker 0: your opinion of The titular character may be different if you read the book, maybe So Friedman Fries is one of our favorite Ford game designers The guy he made power grid Swoggle thinking something.

602
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:37,758
Speaker 1: he makes games.

603
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:39,142
Speaker 1: His name is freedom freeze.

604
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:39,965
Speaker 1: He's got crazy.

605
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:53,008
Speaker 1: His hair looks like Jared Sorenson's hair right and his games come in a green box and the names of the games always begin with F and They're usually really good like fresh fish.

606
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:59,977
Speaker 1: So we played a couple tiny games made by him at magfest Both small card games.

607
00:39:00,097 --> 00:39:03,090
Speaker 1: One of them was Fuji flush and the other one was foppin.

608
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:15,260
Speaker 0: I didn't play foppin, but I've had it explained to me a bunch of times, but I did play Fuji flush Mmm and both these games don't warrant a super deep review, but there are interesting things to say about them Like, I don't know.

609
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:22,770
Speaker 0: I've been enjoying these trick-taking ask light Relatively quick games that actually have pretty serious strategy, right?

610
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:38,731
Speaker 1: It's like, you know in terms it's like these games aren't like so great and so amazing that like in the Puerto Rico T any level but It's like in terms of efficiency like the most strategy and good brain thinking and in the least amount of game Right.

611
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:52,081
Speaker 1: It's like oh, it's just so like, you know elegant and efficient and it's like you can get a whole ton of good You know satisfying worthwhile Strategic gaming in like 10-15 minutes.

612
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:54,227
Speaker 0: Yep, but more importantly they're quick to teach.

613
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:58,248
Speaker 1: They take like a minute I think especially if they already know what trick-taking games.

614
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:07,609
Speaker 1: All right It's like, you know trick-taking games in general I think because it's like it's all the strategy of like, all right Cards and how do I take or not take tricks?

615
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,850
Speaker 1: Hmm, even hearts is like, oh there's a lot of thinking going on here.

616
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:17,779
Speaker 1: It's not just some random bullshit Even though there is some very randomness, you know And then you get a real game and then it's over.

617
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:20,070
Speaker 0: now what I've also found this kind of a side note.

618
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,055
Speaker 0: But this applies to all these games Independent like it's.

619
00:40:23,136 --> 00:40:26,410
Speaker 0: only someone knows the basics of what trick-taking is and we skip that problem.

620
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:30,280
Speaker 0: It is readily apparent immediately when you teach this game to new people.

621
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:40,469
Speaker 0: some people just have a knack For understanding the core of what the game is once you explain the rules and some people just don't.

622
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:45,739
Speaker 0: Yes, and when we taught when we played Fuji flush About two-thirds of our table.

623
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:53,105
Speaker 0: No one had played the game before except the person who taught us Got it right away and started playing like this really a game like real quick.

624
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:54,550
Speaker 0: and the other people?

625
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,100
Speaker 0: I don't think they I don't think even by the end of the game.

626
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,789
Speaker 0: They really understood what was happening to them.

627
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:00,698
Speaker 1: It's not the games fault.

628
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:03,090
Speaker 1: No, here's the deal with Fuji flush, right?

629
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:07,798
Speaker 1: You got this hand of cards Right and you are trying.

630
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:11,530
Speaker 0: they're numbered like what one through twenty four or something, right?

631
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,077
Speaker 1: You're trying to get rid of all your cards.

632
00:41:14,117 --> 00:41:18,230
Speaker 1: You don't want any cards in your hand and then you are the winner, right?

633
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:24,870
Speaker 1: So what happens is you put a card down on the table and the cards with really high values.

634
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:26,491
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of them in the deck Like.

635
00:41:26,591 --> 00:41:35,122
Speaker 0: I think there's one of each of the really high value and then there's like two of the middling ones and three Like if you've got like a sixteen, there's probably not another sixteen out there.

636
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:35,985
Speaker 1: There might be one.

637
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:37,270
Speaker 1: maybe I don't think there is.

638
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,701
Speaker 1: There's a million - but it's like twos and fours like galore, right?

639
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:42,507
Speaker 1: So I put down a four.

640
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,390
Speaker 1: I'm starting the game.

641
00:41:43,691 --> 00:41:44,875
Speaker 0: I'm winning two through twenty.

642
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:45,738
Speaker 0: All right, I'm winning.

643
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:47,243
Speaker 1: four is the highest number out there.

644
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:49,390
Speaker 1: right rim plays an eight.

645
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:51,177
Speaker 1: Oh, I've been beat right?

646
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:52,181
Speaker 1: We're going around clockwise.

647
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:54,570
Speaker 0: Yep, all the people who were beat their card goes away.

648
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,253
Speaker 0: That's a draw.

649
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:59,330
Speaker 1: My four is beat my four goes away and I draw a new card into my hand.

650
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:04,661
Speaker 1: My hand is not decreased in size Therefore I am NOT any closer to winning.

651
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:07,456
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get rid of all the cards in my hand So that sucks.

652
00:42:07,497 --> 00:42:08,845
Speaker 0: So then Joey Jojo plays a two.

653
00:42:08,885 --> 00:42:10,111
Speaker 0: that doesn't beat the card I play.

654
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:15,230
Speaker 1: it doesn't beat rims eight, but it hasn't been beat by someone after him.

655
00:42:15,672 --> 00:42:16,918
Speaker 1: So that two stays.

656
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,490
Speaker 1: now the next person plays another eight.

657
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:26,540
Speaker 1: So we got rims eight a two which survives and then another eight Would get rid of the time.

658
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:31,624
Speaker 1: obviously the two is defeated and you know Joey Jojo's two goes to the middle and I draw a new card.

659
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:32,750
Speaker 1: that eight ain't an eight.

660
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:37,102
Speaker 1: Oh rims eight wasn't defeated because it's an eight right and he got tied.

661
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:40,190
Speaker 1: but because now there are two eights on the table.

662
00:42:40,816 --> 00:42:45,038
Speaker 0: They are now both Sixteens and say Scott plays an eight now.

663
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:46,223
Speaker 1: I got gets back to me.

664
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,672
Speaker 1: It's a four player game and I play an eight 24 that's 24.

665
00:42:48,672 --> 00:42:50,299
Speaker 1: So all the eights are now worth 24, right?

666
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,278
Speaker 1: Someone would need to make us throw those eights away.

667
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,804
Speaker 1: Someone couldn't just play a nine.

668
00:42:57,105 --> 00:43:02,606
Speaker 1: They'd have to play a 25 Right, or they'd have to like have two people play like you.

669
00:43:02,626 --> 00:43:10,324
Speaker 1: have a bunch of people in a row I'll play like nines to get a. you know A bunch of other people have to combine their numbers together somehow to beat our combined force.

670
00:43:10,384 --> 00:43:14,576
Speaker 1: So everyone like eight eight nine Nine Nine.

671
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:15,990
Speaker 1: Oh the eights got beat, right?

672
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:26,327
Speaker 1: But if it gets back to your turn and your card in front of you has not been defeated You put your card in the middle and you do not draw a new card and your hand is now smaller.

673
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:28,174
Speaker 0: if you shared that Card with other people.

674
00:43:28,214 --> 00:43:30,062
Speaker 1: They also put their card in the middle.

675
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:34,903
Speaker 0: So you basically can form Coalitions with other players to like.

676
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:36,630
Speaker 0: you'll all rise together.

677
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:42,970
Speaker 1: but it's not just a vote who wins game because You've got a very limited hand at any given point in time.

678
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,961
Speaker 1: You don't want a big hand you want a small hand.

679
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:48,697
Speaker 0: You're trying to get your options Keep decreasing as time goes on.

680
00:43:48,738 --> 00:43:49,741
Speaker 1: You can't just say man.

681
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:52,110
Speaker 1: I can see that rim only has one card left.

682
00:43:52,411 --> 00:43:54,360
Speaker 1: I really need to team up with Chris against him.

683
00:43:54,661 --> 00:43:56,288
Speaker 1: Let's not form any coalitions with rim.

684
00:43:56,348 --> 00:44:01,670
Speaker 1: right now You can do that all really rim places for and what I've got in my hand to four is great.

685
00:44:02,592 --> 00:44:09,229
Speaker 0: Now it is elegant though in that the the bigger your hand still is the easier It is to form coalitions with other people whose hands are bigger.

686
00:44:09,872 --> 00:44:15,430
Speaker 0: So as you are closer to winning the game your options for coalitions decrease.

687
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:17,310
Speaker 1: I think this is the one flaw in the game.

688
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:20,169
Speaker 1: Is that at the very end you got one card and on your turn?

689
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,257
Speaker 1: You play it and that's all you can do.

690
00:44:22,297 --> 00:44:27,762
Speaker 1: then when if you get beat you draw a new card and then when it's your Turn you play it and it's pretty much at the end of the game.

691
00:44:28,063 --> 00:44:29,490
Speaker 1: You're not making decisions anymore.

692
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:35,950
Speaker 1: You're just playing the card that you draw and hoping that it wins out at some point before someone else empties.

693
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,917
Speaker 0: Reducing that ability.

694
00:44:37,977 --> 00:44:41,810
Speaker 0: that coalition ability of the leading players is a very good mechanic.

695
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:44,089
Speaker 0: It actually it balances the game out like very well.

696
00:44:44,276 --> 00:44:50,010
Speaker 0: Yeah If someone gets a little head with luck They got to be real skilled or real lucky to keep getting ahead.

697
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:53,970
Speaker 0: Everyone else can catch up by going like five five five five and just blow past.

698
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:58,330
Speaker 1: I think the way to make this game absolutely perfect and it may require adding some more cards to the game.

699
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:04,800
Speaker 1: yeah, but basically make everyone's starting hand three cards bigger and Have someone win if they get down to three.

700
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:10,230
Speaker 1: if they get to three or maybe below three Yeah, as soon as they get to two cards left they win immediately, right?

701
00:45:10,693 --> 00:45:14,209
Speaker 1: That way that way and at the end of the game You're still making decisions.

702
00:45:14,732 --> 00:45:23,310
Speaker 1: Right, and it's not just down to a hundred percent luck at the end where you only have like one or two cards But you still have to win the same number the game would still be just as long.

703
00:45:23,631 --> 00:45:31,010
Speaker 1: You start to win the same number of times get rid of the same number of cards But you never reach a part of the game where it's just draw play drop.

704
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:33,798
Speaker 0: That that small rule change.

705
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:36,350
Speaker 0: We've not play tested this, but I think that small rule change.

706
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,209
Speaker 1: You'd have to rebuild the deck is you need more cards?

707
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we have to test.

708
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,670
Speaker 0: maybe you might just have to reduce the max.

709
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:44,670
Speaker 0: It takes up to eight players, which is also actually like right.

710
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:45,373
Speaker 1: Oh, you could just.

711
00:45:45,413 --> 00:45:50,070
Speaker 1: yeah, if you reduce the players count to five then you can give everyone three more cards without any problem.

712
00:45:50,170 --> 00:46:00,770
Speaker 0: right, yep, but I'm confident that a small rule change like that takes this game from good to great and It'd be really interesting to try it and see if our hypothesis is correct.

713
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:06,790
Speaker 0: Cuz I really the why play this game once I really enjoyed that one play it become high level.

714
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,925
Speaker 0: You can see there is a lot of high level interaction.

715
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:11,050
Speaker 0: for how short this game, right?

716
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:11,733
Speaker 1: You're like how many?

717
00:46:11,754 --> 00:46:11,854
Speaker 1: like.

718
00:46:11,914 --> 00:46:16,457
Speaker 1: rim plays an eight and I say I got eight in my hand and it's like well Do I want to help?

719
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:19,090
Speaker 1: but you might can also just play a nine and shut you down.

720
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:19,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

721
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,947
Speaker 1: then you decide like say you say oh no rim has a ton of cards in his hand.

722
00:46:23,007 --> 00:46:23,570
Speaker 1: I'm beating him.

723
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:24,579
Speaker 0: Let's go in on the eights.

724
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,550
Speaker 0: and then I think oh shit I don't want to go out with Scott because that doesn't get me closer to winning.

725
00:46:29,691 --> 00:46:30,594
Speaker 1: There's nothing you can do about it.

726
00:46:30,615 --> 00:46:31,157
Speaker 1: You already played.

727
00:46:31,217 --> 00:46:31,920
Speaker 0: Yeah.

728
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,210
Speaker 1: Oh, by the way, it's not just eights that form coalitions, right?

729
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:34,654
Speaker 1: It could be.

730
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:36,070
Speaker 1: we kept using that as the example.

731
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:42,790
Speaker 1: But it could be like there are times where someone played like 11 and someone else is like, oh, yeah 11 and there's 22 and then another person.

732
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:44,132
Speaker 1: It's like that.

733
00:46:44,152 --> 00:46:54,288
Speaker 0: shit happens and you'll see sometimes like someone plays like a four or a five and then someone's like two And then two and then two and then two and then the four gets knocked out and shit happens.

734
00:46:54,328 --> 00:46:54,790
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

735
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, the low numbers can beat the high numbers.

736
00:46:57,617 --> 00:46:58,139
Speaker 1: it happens.

737
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:07,222
Speaker 0: apparently this game re implements another older game called drop pelt wound drifak Great name designer Friedman fries.

738
00:47:07,503 --> 00:47:09,050
Speaker 0: All right, so I guess he remade the game.

739
00:47:09,332 --> 00:47:15,098
Speaker 0: Okay, this original game had cards number two through 15 But was otherwise mostly.

740
00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:16,321
Speaker 1: how old is this guy now?

741
00:47:16,362 --> 00:47:18,688
Speaker 1: Cuz I remember him looking pretty young in the 10-15 years.

742
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,523
Speaker 0: I think he's been making games forever.

743
00:47:21,543 --> 00:47:22,810
Speaker 1: Well, I mean he made power grid.

744
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,094
Speaker 1: He doesn't have to do anything else.

745
00:47:24,235 --> 00:47:30,394
Speaker 0: how much money made from drop felt and drifak was anonymously sent to various people in March of 2016?

746
00:47:30,394 --> 00:47:40,285
Speaker 0: the rules or the box gave no hint to the identity of the designer in July of the 2016 Friedman freeze was revealed to be the designer.

747
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:49,439
Speaker 0: So he anonymously sent this game out to get it play tested I assume and then reimplemented it based on that feedback as Fuji flush.

748
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:53,937
Speaker 0: Wow, he released it as a D&D game as opposed to an F&F game.

749
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:54,700
Speaker 1: Well, he had to hide.

750
00:47:55,101 --> 00:47:58,094
Speaker 0: I wonder if there's other D&D games released anonymously.

751
00:47:58,114 --> 00:47:58,917
Speaker 0: They're actually him.

752
00:47:59,078 --> 00:47:59,519
Speaker 1: go for it.

753
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:13,500
Speaker 0: So this games if you like if you want a game like six nymphs or Yet or even wizard like this is just one of those games.

754
00:48:14,022 --> 00:48:19,080
Speaker 1: The thing with I was gonna say like wizard is like the best still but wizard takes a while.

755
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,785
Speaker 1: You got a lot of hands.

756
00:48:19,805 --> 00:48:22,180
Speaker 1: You got to play through all these other games that you know.

757
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,439
Speaker 1: The six are these smaller card games?

758
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,175
Speaker 1: Get you almost all the fun of the wizard and a lot less time and a lot less space.

759
00:48:29,295 --> 00:48:34,052
Speaker 0: even six nymphs Like requires many plays sure to finish.

760
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:34,513
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

761
00:48:34,674 --> 00:48:36,098
Speaker 0: This is just like BAM and it's done.

762
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:42,611
Speaker 0: Yep So the other game which I did not play but I need to know the rules Play to know it is foppin so foppin.

763
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:49,415
Speaker 1: I guess our friends couldn't get a real copy But their friend was a graphic designer and made a Steven Universe themed copy.

764
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:50,960
Speaker 1: that looked like a professional game.

765
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:51,764
Speaker 0: Oh, what Claude?

766
00:48:52,247 --> 00:48:53,635
Speaker 1: Oh that yeah, it was Claude.

767
00:48:53,676 --> 00:48:54,420
Speaker 1: That's what it was called.

768
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:02,885
Speaker 1: So and that game it was basically the same exact game only it looked like Steven Universe and it looked like someone Professionally made this.

769
00:49:02,945 --> 00:49:04,251
Speaker 1: that was unreal cards.

770
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:06,440
Speaker 1: It was you know, but it was the same game as foppin.

771
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,312
Speaker 0: Oh, the original art is real good though, too.

772
00:49:08,594 --> 00:49:08,876
Speaker 1: Sure.

773
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:09,439
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't it be?

774
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,106
Speaker 1: So here's the deal with foppin.

775
00:49:11,568 --> 00:49:18,627
Speaker 1: you got four different suits of cards but one of the suits as like a ton of cards in it and the Second one is less cards.

776
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:21,440
Speaker 1: The third one is even less cards and the fourth one is like a really weak suit.

777
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,886
Speaker 1: it doesn't have a lot of cards at all and it's trick-taking.

778
00:49:24,926 --> 00:49:34,000
Speaker 1: so you play a card and everyone has to follow suit and Someone wins the trick by having the highest card and then you know, they take the lead and so on and so forth.

779
00:49:34,122 --> 00:49:34,934
Speaker 1: It's a trick-taking game.

780
00:49:36,162 --> 00:49:41,854
Speaker 1: however The goal of this trick-taking game is not to win all the tricks.

781
00:49:42,335 --> 00:49:42,556
Speaker 1: right.

782
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:44,080
Speaker 1: that is something you can do.

783
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,411
Speaker 1: That would be beneficial for you, but it is not necessary.

784
00:49:48,014 --> 00:49:50,882
Speaker 1: It is the game about not being in last Right.

785
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:59,734
Speaker 1: So what happens is you play the trick and if you have the weakest card in the trick You are now the Claude and on the next hand you don't play.

786
00:49:59,794 --> 00:50:01,820
Speaker 1: you just sit there and watch everyone else play that trick.

787
00:50:02,682 --> 00:50:11,340
Speaker 1: So on the first trick of the game everyone plays but from then on Someone's always sitting out and it's never the same person twice in a row because they were the Claude last hand.

788
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,180
Speaker 1: So then I can't be the Claude this hand, right?

789
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,139
Speaker 1: And when you're the Claude you don't play a card because you're sitting out.

790
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:27,019
Speaker 1: But that sucks because you win the game when you get rid of your last card which means you play your last card in a trick and you don't come in last place.

791
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:28,966
Speaker 1: and That's how that goes.

792
00:50:29,087 --> 00:50:31,260
Speaker 0: It's a clever mechanic because think it think about it.

793
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,692
Speaker 0: Usually it's like in hearts.

794
00:50:32,874 --> 00:50:37,160
Speaker 0: It's Somebody wins the trick and may get fucked because there might be a bunch of hearts in the trick.

795
00:50:37,762 --> 00:50:41,356
Speaker 0: This game is somebody loses the trick badly.

796
00:50:41,376 --> 00:50:41,878
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

797
00:50:42,892 --> 00:50:46,706
Speaker 1: so That's pretty much all it comes down to this.

798
00:50:46,787 --> 00:50:47,930
Speaker 1: is the extra rules right?

799
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,760
Speaker 1: if let's say someone can't follow suit?

800
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:54,580
Speaker 1: Obviously, you know matter how high the number on their card is they're losing.

801
00:50:55,282 --> 00:51:01,280
Speaker 1: But if two people or more can't follow suit whoever's got the lower number and the weaker suit is the person who is the Claude.

802
00:51:01,501 --> 00:51:07,359
Speaker 1: Right, so it's like, you know playing a higher number when you can't follow suit is still better cuz at least.

803
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:14,000
Speaker 1: hey I'm not gonna you know, hopefully I'll beat someone else who can't follow suit also at the end of the hand, right?

804
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,548
Speaker 1: Usually people don't have positive scores in this game.

805
00:51:16,688 --> 00:51:23,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you and and You have gotten rid of all your cards you get ten points.

806
00:51:24,363 --> 00:51:27,539
Speaker 1: If you have any cards in your hand those cards become negative points.

807
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:32,158
Speaker 1: So the bigger the numbers are on the cards that are still in your hand the more points you lose.

808
00:51:32,178 --> 00:51:33,784
Speaker 1: you want to get rid Of your big numbered cards.

809
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,474
Speaker 1: if you got like a 15 in your hand and the hand is over.

810
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:37,980
Speaker 1: That's negative 15.

811
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,105
Speaker 1: That sucks ass.

812
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,316
Speaker 1: you want to end the hand with like a negative 2 in your hand.

813
00:51:41,336 --> 00:51:42,059
Speaker 1: That'd be way better.

814
00:51:43,121 --> 00:51:44,959
Speaker 1: Also in the deck are four ones.

815
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,505
Speaker 1: The ones are weak.

816
00:51:47,806 --> 00:51:50,254
Speaker 1: Obviously, it's hard to win a trick with them, right?

817
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:52,120
Speaker 1: It's hard to avoid if you play them.

818
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,600
Speaker 1: It's hard to not be Claude because they're number one the weakest number, but they follow suit no matter what?

819
00:51:58,102 --> 00:52:03,780
Speaker 1: So if everyone can follow suit and you can except for one other person and they play some other suit.

820
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,257
Speaker 1: That's off suit and you play your one you beat them and you can.

821
00:52:07,277 --> 00:52:10,230
Speaker 1: yeah I couldn't follow suit but I had my one and I got.

822
00:52:10,511 --> 00:52:12,339
Speaker 1: I avoided being Claude one extra time.

823
00:52:12,399 --> 00:52:14,829
Speaker 1: Yeah There's one other thing in this game.

824
00:52:15,593 --> 00:52:20,929
Speaker 1: when the hand starts Everyone looking at their starting hand right has to bet.

825
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:27,839
Speaker 1: you either say I'm going to get rid of all my cards or I'm Not going to get rid of all my car.

826
00:52:29,442 --> 00:52:32,880
Speaker 1: If you say you're not going to you play just you just play.

827
00:52:33,662 --> 00:52:41,062
Speaker 1: but if you say I can do it, I'm going to get rid of all my cards with this hand and You succeed.

828
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,289
Speaker 1: instead of getting 10 points you get 20 points.

829
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:44,032
Speaker 1: That's big.

830
00:52:44,252 --> 00:52:44,834
Speaker 1: That's real big.

831
00:52:44,854 --> 00:52:46,600
Speaker 0: That's a lot like Euchre like go it alone.

832
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,666
Speaker 0: I'm going alone double my score right?

833
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:53,640
Speaker 1: But if you say you can do it and you can't your negative is doubled.

834
00:52:54,742 --> 00:52:56,915
Speaker 1: So if you got like a 15 in your hand, it's like negative 30.

835
00:52:56,915 --> 00:52:59,790
Speaker 1: Ah Oh, you went alone.

836
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:00,980
Speaker 0: You got youked, right?

837
00:53:01,341 --> 00:53:10,400
Speaker 1: So when I played this it was funny Like there was a hand where I bet and I came close, but I didn't make it so like negative five or something.

838
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:10,642
Speaker 1: It was.

839
00:53:10,682 --> 00:53:12,719
Speaker 1: it was you know, it was negative six something like that, right?

840
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,522
Speaker 1: Cuz I had like.

841
00:53:13,663 --> 00:53:14,566
Speaker 1: I'd like a three left.

842
00:53:14,626 --> 00:53:18,860
Speaker 1: It was grid the next time like I'm not betting and then I got rid of all.

843
00:53:20,341 --> 00:53:21,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I like.

844
00:53:22,049 --> 00:53:33,680
Speaker 1: it was the first three hands of the stupid game and Every single hand I bet the opposite of what I should have bet and I'm just like ah if I just bet differently I'd be at like plus 30 right now, but instead of a negative 10

845
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,303
Speaker 0: Yeah,

846
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:34,786
Speaker 1: I played it.

847
00:53:34,846 --> 00:53:36,634
Speaker 1: I played it great, but I bet wrong.

848
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:39,582
Speaker 1: So the betting is huge and That's this game.

849
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:44,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not as short as Fuji flush because you got to play the multiple hands.

850
00:53:44,985 --> 00:53:46,420
Speaker 0: There's more tricky.

851
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:54,871
Speaker 1: You're dealing out the whole deck to everyone or you didn't got a lot of cards to everyone right and you're playing all of them Right, you know so it but it's not like wizard.

852
00:53:54,891 --> 00:53:56,440
Speaker 1: we have to do that multiple times.

853
00:53:56,843 --> 00:53:58,899
Speaker 1: So it's sort of this in-between length game.

854
00:53:59,682 --> 00:54:03,074
Speaker 1: But it's also really interesting like trying to just not be last.

855
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:06,406
Speaker 1: if you just come in second on every trick It's like it's super great.

856
00:54:06,907 --> 00:54:10,340
Speaker 1: Another thing that can happen a lot is because there's different numbers of the different suits.

857
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:13,513
Speaker 1: It's like this we were playing in a Steven Universe version, right?

858
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:15,120
Speaker 1: So Stevens were the weakest suit.

859
00:54:15,281 --> 00:54:26,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, there were not a lot of Steven cards in the deck period And there was one hand where I had a ton of Stevens, which is really bad because no one else is gonna lead Stevens.

860
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:33,540
Speaker 1: So if I try to I'm eventually gonna be forced to play them and they're gonna lose every time and I'll keep being the Claude.

861
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:38,540
Speaker 0: And that's like when you're stuck leading the hearts at the end of a game of hearts and nobody else is gonna top you.

862
00:54:39,261 --> 00:54:45,700
Speaker 1: However What happens if say I play I didn't I wasn't a hundred percent Stevens in my hand, right?

863
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:46,663
Speaker 1: I win.

864
00:54:46,823 --> 00:54:47,587
Speaker 1: just one trick.

865
00:54:47,607 --> 00:54:48,471
Speaker 1: gotta come in first.

866
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:50,159
Speaker 1: So now I'm leading.

867
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:54,049
Speaker 1: I Play a Steven and no one can follow Stevens.

868
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,420
Speaker 1: I just play another Steven and another Steven and another Steve.

869
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,156
Speaker 1: I just I'm keep winning the tricks first place.

870
00:55:00,337 --> 00:55:05,428
Speaker 1: I'm Setting the suit at Steven every single trick Constantly.

871
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:07,040
Speaker 1: no one can follow suit.

872
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:14,740
Speaker 1: the Claude keeps moving around between the other players as they dump their other Cards and suddenly they see me keep doing this and they don't have Stevens.

873
00:55:14,861 --> 00:55:19,340
Speaker 1: They had to keep playing like they want to play their high point cards from the other suits.

874
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:33,226
Speaker 1: Right because then if they lose this trick, but that just feeds you but that if they dump those cards That means when I get to when I'm out of Stevens and I have to play something else my something else's Mar probably the strongest cards left.

875
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,192
Speaker 1: because they wanted to avoid having low scores.

876
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:37,759
Speaker 1: they use those strong cards and lost them.

877
00:55:38,562 --> 00:55:43,520
Speaker 1: Right, but maybe they save them and then if they end the gate the hand with those still in hand.

878
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,120
Speaker 1: That's big negative, right?

879
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:50,700
Speaker 1: And so is this really great balancing act that goes on where you got to really count cards?

880
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:58,320
Speaker 1: Think about what's in other people's hands, you know And adding a theme to it because you can't get the original version.

881
00:55:58,904 --> 00:56:04,932
Speaker 1: I guess you know, it would be probably a little bit more fun If I watched more episodes of Steven Universe than like three you should it's.

882
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:07,520
Speaker 0: uh, it's escalated quite a bit since you stopped watching.

883
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:14,548
Speaker 1: Why I got me, you know My plan right now is wait for adventure time to end Like in a year or six months or whenever.

884
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:18,139
Speaker 1: watch all that now and then I'll move on.

885
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:20,024
Speaker 0: Well, dr.

886
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:23,159
Speaker 0: Me ninja just ended like for real so you can catch up on that, too.

887
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:24,003
Speaker 1: I'm gonna.

888
00:56:24,204 --> 00:56:24,907
Speaker 1: I'm working on my.

889
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:27,880
Speaker 1: basically I've been because of technological issues.

890
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,640
Speaker 1: I failed to read webcomics for like a year and I'm gonna rectify that real soon.

891
00:56:32,784 --> 00:56:39,953
Speaker 0: Yeah Luckily you're at a point where multiple webcomics that are long-running are getting their ends or big stopping points So you can just catch up to those points.

892
00:56:40,073 --> 00:56:44,154
Speaker 1: Yeah in like binges It's more about figuring out where I left off and getting everything sorted out.

893
00:56:44,335 --> 00:56:47,567
Speaker 0: Yep, and actually dr Me ninja is kind of complex in terms of like.

894
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:51,359
