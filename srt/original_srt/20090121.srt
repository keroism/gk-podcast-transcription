1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,046
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday January 21st.

2
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:12,748
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:25,880
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights, and they were 11.

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,700
Speaker 0: Let's do this in the spirit of watching anime.

5
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,257
Speaker 0: That's new so we can talk about it or at least know about it.

6
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,210
Speaker 0: We uh we checked out two of the shows.

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,740
Speaker 0: well three of the shows from the current season of anime.

8
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:49,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't even remember well There was like two perverted ones And there was one that we had high hopes for based on the description.

9
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:50,600
Speaker 1: that wasn't so great.

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,200
Speaker 1: It was not in the first episode.

11
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:58,720
Speaker 0: What amazed me was that the one that I thought would be more perverted was slightly less perverted, but still creepy.

12
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:03,171
Speaker 0: I didn't expect to be as perverted at least right away like I expected.

13
00:01:03,753 --> 00:01:12,319
Speaker 0: if I watch the first like two minutes of that Show I think it was like the one about the two sisters who are hot for their brother, but step step brother whatever.

14
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:20,939
Speaker 0: yeah I didn't expect to within the first minute get interaction surrounded by you ten of flowers.

15
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, that kind of came out of nowhere and really killed that show.

16
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:34,293
Speaker 1: for me I mean you know for a while We had like the sort of comedically perverted shows you know sort of like.

17
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:36,840
Speaker 1: you know love Hina's or Golden Boys and things.

18
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,242
Speaker 1: You know.

19
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:43,560
Speaker 1: and then they sort of went to the moe shows right which were perverted But not any not in any outward fashion.

20
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:51,425
Speaker 0: It was I would say that love Hina was a big bridge between the two because love Hina was a lot more moe and a lot Less funny mm-hmm.

21
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:57,342
Speaker 0: I can't say less funny because that doesn't really do it justice not funny Terrible.

22
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:59,169
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean I had cute turtles.

23
00:01:59,209 --> 00:01:59,971
Speaker 1: that was about it.

24
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:02,400
Speaker 0: I mean at least Golden Boy was actually pretty funny.

25
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:04,266
Speaker 0: We had a show on that.

26
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:05,670
Speaker 1: I haven't had to watch it again.

27
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:08,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't seen that show since all right years ago.

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never even saw all of it right.

29
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:17,220
Speaker 1: But now it seems like I guess some of the shows that are coming out now are just outright perverted.

30
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:17,963
Speaker 1: It's like no.

31
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,830
Speaker 1: It's not you know do moe.

32
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:22,180
Speaker 1: That's perverted, but only in a hidden way.

33
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:26,438
Speaker 1: You know let's not do perverted, but comedy on top to make fun of it.

34
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:32,980
Speaker 1: Let's just come out right with the perversion, but then just you know keep it a little you know covered up.

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,024
Speaker 1: So it's not hentai.

36
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:37,499
Speaker 1: They're basically just making hentai, but covering it up, so it's not.

37
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,146
Speaker 1: and and Yeah, no interest in that.

38
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:42,771
Speaker 0: It's basically softcore porn.

39
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,540
Speaker 0: It's the same thing you'd see on like cinnamax skin of eggs.

40
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:49,697
Speaker 0: Yes, if you want to be clever and call it that yep.

41
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:55,020
Speaker 0: And then the one show we actually had hopes for which was like girl.

42
00:02:55,261 --> 00:03:05,240
Speaker 0: I had hopes for a couple shows girl on robot bicycle Maybe a little bit like bubblegum crisis or something, but now now that show turned into initial D in like five minutes.

43
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:10,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, maybe it's it's sort of like Moonlight Mile where they sort of tease you with this political stuff.

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,467
Speaker 1: That could be really cool, but they debt.

45
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:13,772
Speaker 1: in the first episode at least.

46
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,145
Speaker 1: that never connects to the actual characters They're showing you.

47
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:19,020
Speaker 1: it's just sort of like they're showing you in it.

48
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:30,232
Speaker 1: It's like imagine if you were watching initial D and every five minutes They cut to C-Span for like 10 seconds and then cut back and your man like wow I wish this initial D part with the cars had.

49
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:32,300
Speaker 1: event has something to do with that politics.

50
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,147
Speaker 1: I see that would be really cool.

51
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:36,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, but instead you get to the end of the episode.

52
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:37,300
Speaker 1: just they never connect.

53
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:37,965
Speaker 1: It's really.

54
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,760
Speaker 1: they're just cutting away to show you C-Span.

55
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:50,211
Speaker 0: Yeah, except it was C-Span and Sherpa sex and between the two were a little Gecky guy esque moments like when he uses that crane to save that guy.

56
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:56,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there was nothing else there, but I Don't want to call it flag syndrome because flag was another anime that did this.

57
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,300
Speaker 0: it looked awesome.

58
00:03:58,521 --> 00:03:59,607
Speaker 0: It looked so good.

59
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:00,652
Speaker 0: The premise was great.

60
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:05,572
Speaker 0: The imagery was amazing and then by the end of the episode it literally turned into.

61
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:10,457
Speaker 0: the robots are gonna go and Steal that flag back.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:21,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, whoo Yeah, but this show like I feel like there's a big warning sign that you can see and I'm starting to recognize it more.

63
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,799
Speaker 0: But if you're watching a show that is ostensibly about something else.

64
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:38,034
Speaker 0: But they start giving you the details of the made-up machines in the show And I'm not talking details like that's the red one That's the blue one, but like this one has the made-up number made-ups parameter.

65
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:40,000
Speaker 0: They give you the exact length in meters.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,860
Speaker 0: Well, I think the key they show you the interface and it actually matters.

67
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:50,709
Speaker 1: Well, I think the key right and how to do it right and how to do it wrong Right and how to do it right is something like Gundam seed.

68
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,287
Speaker 1: and what Gundam seed does is they tell you things in Gundam Seed about

69
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:55,762
Speaker 0: fire the low and green Yeah,

70
00:04:55,782 --> 00:05:12,333
Speaker 1: and they have phase shift armor and all these sorts of things right and you know all different systems But they don't ever have a scene where they stop and have a character just explain to you all The technology as if they were explaining you the rules to a board game.

71
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:23,371
Speaker 1: It's just things happen and When different things get used they say the name of those things and then you see with your eyeballs Sort of how they work which so it's good.

72
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:28,013
Speaker 1: even though they're doing the same exact thing They're spreading it out and they're sort of revealing it.

73
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:42,140
Speaker 1: naturally whenever you see a show where there's a scene where you have a character like it's completely explaining all the details of some piece of Machinery or some system or some like how the magic works in this fantasy world, right?

74
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,819
Speaker 1: And they spend like a good minute just telling you all the rules like oh, you know in this fantasy world, you know.

75
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:52,000
Speaker 0: Wait though because Full Metal Alchemist did that that was a pretty good show.

76
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,248
Speaker 1: No, no Full Metal Alchemist didn't spend like a whole minute.

77
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:56,235
Speaker 1: It was just like tokakoka the end.

78
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,500
Speaker 0: No, they spend more time.

79
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:08,320
Speaker 0: I just think you because it's it's not because the shape and but Full Metal Alchemist I would note is not a rewatchable show, but it was still a pretty good show Okay, but I think it's more than in a show like Gundam seed, right?

80
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:21,279
Speaker 0: when they bring these things up the show isn't focusing on the I don't know details of the fake technology of the fake world kind of like those bad fantasy books that go into the details Of the witch locks and all that stuff.

81
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:34,320
Speaker 0: but if you use it as consistent background to make the world consistent and make sense and be interesting in color and flavor or If those things are relevant to the plot then it can work.

82
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:42,708
Speaker 0: The problem is when it turns into initial D syndrome where the show revolves solely around the technicalities of the fake technology.

83
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:51,230
Speaker 0: at least initial D Almost was a little bit like real cars for the first season Kinda and I point out that I love initial D.

84
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,920
Speaker 1: I did not sleep for the hero beat music.

85
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:57,879
Speaker 0: I did not bother with anything past the first season for a reason.

86
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:02,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, without eurobeat music initially really wouldn't have anything but right back.

87
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:05,320
Speaker 0: It's like they designed this very specific mech.

88
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:26,956
Speaker 0: That's really cool to people who really like mechs and motorcycles and then they made a girl who's really good at it who's basically gonna be the Takumi and I Don't see how this is going to turn into a good show because the plot of the first episode is it gets out of control She's on it They do Made up bath, but add crap to make it work and save her in the end by plugging in.

89
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,381
Speaker 0: they show you exactly what they're Doing.

90
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,405
Speaker 0: like I plug into this thing.

91
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:31,433
Speaker 0: I type this command and then this happens.

92
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:32,679
Speaker 0: It's fanboy fodder.

93
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:37,520
Speaker 0: Just like Gunslinger girls where they keep showing you the guns and talking about the guns.

94
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:42,800
Speaker 0: It's like the gun fanboy is gonna be into that show because you keep learning about the guns and talking about the guns.

95
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:43,885
Speaker 1: Yeah You did.

96
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:52,620
Speaker 1: a good show is a show that Concentrates on the characters and the plot and has those sorts of other things there and maybe fleshed out a little bit.

97
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:03,260
Speaker 1: But just for flavor when the focus of the show is on those You know things that don't really matter for the characters of the plot than that is or when those are the characters.

98
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really too bad though because the show otherwise was beautiful.

99
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:19,508
Speaker 0: I mean even they looked really good while the plot of the first episode was Real dumb the character designs were pretty good and the animation was great and the scenes where she was riding that robot were amazing But they were amazing fluff.

100
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,680
Speaker 0: So I don't think I'm gonna watch any more ride back unless I'm gonna watch.

101
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:22,981
Speaker 1: You know what?

102
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,126
Speaker 1: I'm watching I'm gonna start watching.

103
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:30,019
Speaker 1: I think starting tomorrow old captain Harlock for the 70s I got like 42 episodes worth the whole show.

104
00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:37,687
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm definitely going to finish up Nodama Cantabile Paris and then I'm gonna move on to Patty Finishing birdie the mighty.

105
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:40,840
Speaker 0: I really really like that new birdie the mighty.

106
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,780
Speaker 1: Okay, so you might know right that your comic books are ordered two months in advance.

107
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:48,719
Speaker 1: That's sort of how this thing works, right?

108
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:58,300
Speaker 1: So, you know what happens is usually, you know You get these order forms and and previews and they start to release them about you know, the late middle of the month.

109
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:04,557
Speaker 1: So right now they're starting to release, you know some February previews right?

110
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:08,680
Speaker 1: for you know Comic books that you will be able to buy on the shelf in April, right?

111
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:16,749
Speaker 1: so it's February for April and I saw something in there that was a Much personal interest.

112
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:28,094
Speaker 1: All right, you see when I was a kid I wasn't as smart as I am now and I think that's true for almost everybody and You know, I didn't have a lot of money either.

113
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:33,099
Speaker 1: so I you know Couldn't afford to buy every comic book in the comic book store, which I probably would have done.

114
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:38,095
Speaker 1: I'm very glad that I didn't because I would have been much like rim in his younger days.

115
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:41,247
Speaker 1: if he was you know had money He would have had a room full of swords.

116
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:44,500
Speaker 0: Well, I always say I gotta make this graph so people can link to it.

117
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:52,240
Speaker 0: It's the graph of how much money you have How much desire for swords you have and your age and whenever the three factors come into line?

118
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,050
Speaker 0: You're fucked and you're gonna own a whole bunch of sword.

119
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:04,680
Speaker 1: All right, the same thing happened to me with you know, like bad comic books You know cuz I still you know, I saw I have a desire for comic books but not bad ones like I did.

120
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:14,240
Speaker 1: But no when I was a kid the comic books I could only afford a couple complex by the way They were a dollar and fifty cents for those little flimsy things in those days.

121
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:17,655
Speaker 0: All right, so I know something said the first x-men comic book.

122
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:29,763
Speaker 0: I actually owned Came in the x-men board game That I bought just because I wanted to paint the fairly high quality miniatures that came with awesome Really?

123
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:30,686
Speaker 0: I hated the x-men.

124
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:32,092
Speaker 0: I just bought the game because.

125
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:41,780
Speaker 1: so when I was a kid, I bought x-men but the other comic I bought was spider-man 2099 and Spider-man 2099 is a story about you know, some future world.

126
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:55,099
Speaker 1: That's all sci-fi and high-tech and there's a guy who basically he doesn't have a lot to do with Peter Parker But you know, his powers are very similar and he you know calls himself spider-man 2099 and the whole thing, right?

127
00:10:55,882 --> 00:11:00,999
Speaker 1: So it's actually not bad considering actually it's pretty damn good.

128
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:10,619
Speaker 1: and The thing is I have every issue of this comic because I collected it when I was a kid You know and it has you know, some sort of personal value.

129
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:17,275
Speaker 1: but Marvel has never reprinted this comic or collected it in a trade paperback or anything.

130
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,843
Speaker 1: and This month right?

131
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:33,620
Speaker 1: Well February for delivery in April is finally going to be a trade paperback of spider-man 2099 Uh-huh, but it's only going to be get this the first ten issues and I think there's like 30 some odd issues something like that

132
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,387
Speaker 0: all right, so like four or five trades,

133
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:40,200
Speaker 1: yeah, and It's gonna be $30 at least cover price

134
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:40,559
Speaker 0: You know.

135
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:46,500
Speaker 0: It sounds like they realize that the people who were fans of it will buy it if they re-release it.

136
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,311
Speaker 1: The thing is I would have considered buying.

137
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:52,642
Speaker 1: actually I planned to buy it before I Existed.

138
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:57,867
Speaker 0: you're gonna say but and before I let you say but I'm gonna butt in and point out that you are not their target Demographic.

139
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:58,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

140
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:01,369
Speaker 1: Think about it, right?

141
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,680
Speaker 1: It's like I was thinking all mad.

142
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:04,520
Speaker 1: I hope one day they put it out in trades.

143
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,638
Speaker 1: I get rid of all these stupid comic books and just have trades of it and it'll be awesome, right?

144
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,179
Speaker 1: Well 30 bucks eat for you know, ten issues Dude, that's like three dollars an issue.

145
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:22,100
Speaker 1: That's way too much money way too much money considering I already have the issues.

146
00:12:23,061 --> 00:12:30,666
Speaker 1: so I think what I'm gonna do is you ever go to the library and you see there are some books in the library that Don't look like books from borders.

147
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:38,539
Speaker 1: They sort of have like these really generic solid color bindings and there's like the Wait, are you gonna get your spider-man?

148
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,205
Speaker 0: Comics bound.

149
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:41,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's only $15.

150
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,057
Speaker 0: It's not that expensive.

151
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:46,976
Speaker 0: I was gonna point out I was surprised you hadn't been doing that with all your old comics before.

152
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,874
Speaker 1: well, you know Now some of them aren't really worth binding.

153
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:50,640
Speaker 1: You know what I'm saying?

154
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,271
Speaker 0: Well, the best part is now that you know living in New York.

155
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,020
Speaker 0: There are plenty of places in the city.

156
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:55,639
Speaker 0: That'll just do it.

157
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,880
Speaker 1: But now there's a place that library binding that like specializes in doing it to comic books.

158
00:13:00,522 --> 00:13:02,168
Speaker 1: So you just you pay you 15 bucks.

159
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,943
Speaker 1: you put the comics in the mail in the order you want them bound and then they send Them back to you.

160
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:07,272
Speaker 1: and they're like experts at it.

161
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:12,899
Speaker 1: and actually, you know Most of what they do is you know doing those generic bindings for libraries that you see.

162
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:22,858
Speaker 1: You know where it's like a solid color hardcover binding with like some really boring print on the on the spine Clever girl, so that's what I'm gonna do.

163
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:27,977
Speaker 1: that way I don't have to you know If I'm gonna cuz think about it, even if I get the best discount I can get is a 50% discount.

164
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:35,444
Speaker 1: It's $15 right to buy the trade or it's $15 to bind up the issues I've got.

165
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,320
Speaker 1: and you know if I bind up the issues I've got.

166
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:44,787
Speaker 1: While I hate advertisements These early 90s Advertisements are a high quality now.

167
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,231
Speaker 1: They have they have become art.

168
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,515
Speaker 1: They're no longer ads.

169
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,200
Speaker 0: There's something I mean Brock's rocks.

170
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:52,310
Speaker 0: There's something old TSR game about seeing old advertising.

171
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:52,992
Speaker 0: It's like one thing.

172
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:56,742
Speaker 0: I used to love about watching old VHS tape.

173
00:13:57,043 --> 00:13:57,565
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

174
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,571
Speaker 0: Oh, man, cuz I have these daykillers.

175
00:13:59,611 --> 00:13:59,892
Speaker 0: I've talked.

176
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:01,156
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah at RIT.

177
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:02,039
Speaker 0: They were the daykillers.

178
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:15,430
Speaker 0: They were Super slow, you know like eight-hour VHS tapes with just like back-to-back episodes of The Simpsons without ads but every now and then an ad would be in there just because I wasn't paying attention or someone dropped the ball.

179
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:22,940
Speaker 0: when we're recording this stuff as a kid and Watching an ad that is more than a decade old is always a feast for the eyes and ears.

180
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:23,783
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird.

181
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:25,128
Speaker 1: how like an advertisement right?

182
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:30,170
Speaker 1: It's like the worst thing ever if it's brand new, but if it's old It's no longer an advertisement.

183
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,840
Speaker 1: It's just art now and it's awesome.

184
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:32,982
Speaker 1: It's like.

185
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:37,759
Speaker 1: I think what we should do is we should just ban all advertising that isn't at least five years old.

186
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:41,019
Speaker 1: You see if you want to put an ad on TV, you've got to make it.

187
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:44,149
Speaker 1: You've got to wait five years and then you can put it on TV.

188
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,457
Speaker 0: That Scott is a terrible idea.

189
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:47,460
Speaker 0: That's an awesome idea.

190
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,384
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

191
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:52,660
Speaker 0: So speaking of terrible ideas, there was an anime that was coming out.

192
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:07,840
Speaker 0: We've talked about it a couple of times Hetalia axis powers, which is based on a webcomic and Basically it's personifications of European nations Bickering with each other and fighting with each other and doing all the things that Europe did for much of its history.

193
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:11,332
Speaker 0: Yeah And it was being made into an anime and it was all set to go.

194
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:19,036
Speaker 0: kids station in Japan picked it up And then they very recently announced that they're no longer picking it up and it is.

195
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:21,279
Speaker 0: it is now officially cancelled.

196
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:24,674
Speaker 1: Now the thing is they still made the show.

197
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:27,800
Speaker 0: the internet Exploded immediately.

198
00:15:28,383 --> 00:15:42,889
Speaker 0: yeah, so it so happens that the rumor going around was that people in Korea signed this gigantic petition saying that it was offensive to Korea and there and and it it glossed over That many Korean people even know or care about.

199
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:43,812
Speaker 0: well, I'll get to that.

200
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:44,433
Speaker 0: I'll get to that.

201
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:49,048
Speaker 0: and that because of that Kid station decided not to show it.

202
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:54,987
Speaker 0: now kids station actually released a Statement saying that quote.

203
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:58,099
Speaker 0: it was unaware of the criticism in Korea.

204
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:02,495
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm that basically they said that the decision had nothing to do with that.

205
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:03,620
Speaker 0: They really weren't aware of it.

206
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:05,398
Speaker 0: It was canceled for other reasons.

207
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,791
Speaker 0: now We can't know for sure obviously because these sorts of things are never.

208
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:12,242
Speaker 0: I mean if you think the anime industry in America is not Transparent.

209
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:16,536
Speaker 0: we have no idea what happened over there kid station for all we know.

210
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:18,793
Speaker 0: I don't know I was trying to think of something funny.

211
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:22,723
Speaker 1: I'm kind of tired Came and told them not to stop that Wizard.

212
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:25,330
Speaker 1: a voodoo lady cast a curse voodoo lady.

213
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,115
Speaker 0: It was clearly a witch-a-lock.

214
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:28,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, you knew what you like.

215
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:40,000
Speaker 0: But have no fear The show is still going to be available because they made it and there are going to be ways to see it in fact.

216
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:43,048
Speaker 0: Quote mobile animate service for mobile phones.

217
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,375
Speaker 0: Oh, I started at the wrong part of that sentence.

218
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:48,569
Speaker 0: regardless animate TV Will have it.

219
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:51,507
Speaker 0: it is going to be on the internet We are going to be able to.

220
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:54,120
Speaker 1: it's not gonna be on TV, but it'll be on the internet and the telephone.

221
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:55,996
Speaker 0: yes, so we will be able to see it.

222
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,140
Speaker 0: and Beyond that I got nothing else.

223
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,576
Speaker 0: But in terms of the petition in Korea as far as I can gather there were several petitions.

224
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,664
Speaker 0: They were Internet petitions.

225
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,431
Speaker 0: Yeah, which basically mean nothing.

226
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:10,711
Speaker 0: Yeah.

227
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:14,440
Speaker 1: No, that's like, you know, that's basically Emily's like favorite thing in the whole world.

228
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,665
Speaker 1: She was into it before.

229
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:21,570
Speaker 1: it was an anime or anything and you know One thing that she told me that I thought was the most interesting part.

230
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:23,760
Speaker 1: Is that basically this this manga?

231
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:38,320
Speaker 1: It was actually a webcomic right that was made by a Japanese, you know Person of unknown gender right because they're sort of secret, you know It's a pen name, right, but the person is living in Brooklyn.

232
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:49,899
Speaker 1: So someone living in Brooklyn made a webcomic right in Japanese in Japanese language but it was a you know webcomic made by a person living in Brooklyn and Then that became an anime.

233
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:56,600
Speaker 1: So all these indie comic creators and all these webcomic creators out there can shut up.

234
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:59,132
Speaker 1: Stop complaining right?

235
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:02,687
Speaker 1: that oh, you know Diamond is so evil.

236
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:06,100
Speaker 1: Oh, but if I don't go with diamond into the comic book store, I can't make money.

237
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:07,519
Speaker 0: No, it's like you can make it.

238
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:18,579
Speaker 1: So first yeah some person in Brooklyn made a webcomic and boom anime and I'm sure that even though it's not on TV I'm sure they're still gonna be getting some green All right.

239
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:28,136
Speaker 0: now for anyone who wants to read the comic it so happens that Emily has taken it upon herself to Start translating large portions of it and I'll whatever it more of.

240
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:28,517
Speaker 0: it's there.

241
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:29,320
Speaker 0: There's an index page.

242
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,879
Speaker 0: We'll link to it.

243
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:38,641
Speaker 0: But Emily is doing a lot of translation work for the original webcomic which from what I have seen Especially if you were into history at all Hilarious.

244
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:44,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, well, you don't get made into a TV TV show by being you know, lamb.

245
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:54,620
Speaker 0: But I mean think about it you this is like Italia is northern Italy and he's like the shonen guy and then there's Russia and Austria and Hungary and all these people.

246
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:58,037
Speaker 1: So I guess the Italian guy is the main character, which is why he's in the title.

247
00:18:58,057 --> 00:19:02,999
Speaker 0: Yes Okay, the name is also kind of a pun but we'll review this once we see it.

248
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:20,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, so things of the day now, I think we've talked about this a couple times before but if you're not fully aware The Ghostbusters is one of the funniest movies ever made.

249
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:25,570
Speaker 0: like Ghostbusters Far away, like I could watch that movie for the rest of my life and never get sick of it.

250
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,538
Speaker 0: That was just well, I don't know.

251
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:30,630
Speaker 1: I think I could watch, you know real Star Wars movies longer.

252
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:31,573
Speaker 0: I don't know.

253
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:42,310
Speaker 0: I think Star Wars and Ghostbusters are very similar in terms of appeal In terms of durability, I think Star Wars 4 5 6 is a little bit more durable.

254
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:43,613
Speaker 0: I don't know.

255
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:44,578
Speaker 0: I really don't know.

256
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:46,648
Speaker 1: I know Ghostbusters is fantastic.

257
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:49,716
Speaker 0: But anyway I'm sure you all know the deal how.

258
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:53,890
Speaker 0: there was a cartoon called the real Ghostbusters and the reason I was a great cartoon.

259
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,332
Speaker 1: I loved it.

260
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:56,140
Speaker 1: The reason you're seeing a Cthulhu episode.

261
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,582
Speaker 1: Yes.

262
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:57,345
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

263
00:19:57,365 --> 00:19:58,490
Speaker 1: You should link to that or something.

264
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:00,650
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure we have have we are anyway.

265
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:09,824
Speaker 0: But I'm sure you all know that it was called the real Ghostbusters because there was this other Ghostbusters cartoon that came out first called Ghostbusters.

266
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:11,530
Speaker 1: that thing is back in those days.

267
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,286
Speaker 1: I didn't even realize there was another Ghostbusters cartoon see until after the real one.

268
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:24,206
Speaker 0: I Did because I remember oh my I saw like in the TV guide thing on our cable cuz we had cable See, I didn't have a TV guy.

269
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,501
Speaker 0: I saw Ghostbusters and I was like Ghostbusters cartoon.

270
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:35,310
Speaker 0: Ah I turn it on and I saw a gorilla and I didn't know what to think.

271
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:40,190
Speaker 0: I actually watched that show for a while Yeah, and then finally the real one came out.

272
00:20:40,250 --> 00:21:01,589
Speaker 0: but a lot of people would used to say that that was like a ripoff of Ghostbusters or like there was some shenanigans where they got the name and made the cartoon and that's why they had to call it the Real Ghostbusters, so I want to set the record straight for anyone who's interested in exactly what went down here because the truth is far sadder than you would believe.

273
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:15,363
Speaker 0: so it all started in 1975 yep, when the Ghostbusters a live-action Television show the opener of which I have linked to as my thing of the day.

274
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:16,868
Speaker 1: It's real bad.

275
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:22,946
Speaker 0: This is Bad like this is back in the era where there was a lot of locally produced television.

276
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:25,578
Speaker 0: like there were TV shows They were only on in the Midwest.

277
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,530
Speaker 1: the thing is some locally produced television.

278
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,285
Speaker 1: It's like great and is like lost for all eternity and it's that kind of sad like romper room.

279
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:33,590
Speaker 1: romper rooms are the fucking best.

280
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:36,238
Speaker 1: But you know, we've lost that.

281
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:39,870
Speaker 1: so it gets good and bad because a lot of it was just terrible.

282
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:49,972
Speaker 0: So then of course the real the Ghostbusters movie the movie that we care about was made in Yes 1984.

283
00:21:49,972 --> 00:22:05,128
Speaker 0: Yep So in 1984 Ghostbusters the movie was made and then in The fake Ghostbusters cartoon was made based on the original movie because they had the rights to it.

284
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:07,402
Speaker 1: This on the original TV show.

285
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:08,430
Speaker 0: Yeah the original TV show.

286
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,290
Speaker 0: So then after that the feet they said oh crap and they made the real Ghostbusters.

287
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,859
Speaker 1: Now did they make the 1986 cartoon remake of the 1970s TV show?

288
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:25,469
Speaker 1: knowing about the popularity of the 1984 movie and attempting to capitalize.

289
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:31,690
Speaker 0: so When they were making Ghostbusters that was the working title and after they started filming and putting stuff together.

290
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,428
Speaker 0: They found out that there was some other thing called Ghostbusters Mm-hmm.

291
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:42,287
Speaker 0: so they made up a bunch of alternate titles and they were ready if like basically they were gonna try to get the rights and If they couldn't then they were just gonna change the name.

292
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:55,730
Speaker 0: But as the production went on people got so attached to the name Ghostbusters that they approached Filmmation and said look we need Ghostbusters name and they got the rights to call a movie Ghostbusters.

293
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:58,599
Speaker 0: They did not get any other rights.

294
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:05,298
Speaker 0: So once the movie was a success Filmmation put out Ghostbusters based on that crappy TV show.

295
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:08,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they did were attempting to capitalize on the great movie.

296
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:16,130
Speaker 1: Yes, but the thing is they couldn't even though they could write capitalize by calling their cartoon Ghostbusters.

297
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:21,736
Speaker 1: They couldn't capitalize by putting you know Ray Egon, etc.

298
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:24,684
Speaker 1: Slimer in there because they didn't own that shit.

299
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:28,449
Speaker 0: No, but instead they had prime evil and the Skelevision.

300
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:33,275
Speaker 0: Yeah, great and Sabone No, and Sabone was a skull.

301
00:23:33,516 --> 00:23:34,739
Speaker 0: That was also a telephone.

302
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:37,745
Speaker 0: I watched this show for like a little while.

303
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:40,803
Speaker 1: I Feel bad for you.

304
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:44,062
Speaker 0: They use this like skeleton elevator.

305
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:46,010
Speaker 0: It was and they had this car.

306
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:49,600
Speaker 0: It was and there was a gorilla who animated this thing.

307
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,670
Speaker 0: Ah, I don't even know I'd like to interview them.

308
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:54,523
Speaker 0: Would you really have me?

309
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:55,389
Speaker 1: interesting is all hell?

310
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,443
Speaker 0: Oh, sorry, the animated television series was created by Filmmation and distributed by someone else.

311
00:24:00,503 --> 00:24:02,228
Speaker 1: Filmmation not equal Funimation.

312
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:04,183
Speaker 0: Yes two different things.

313
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:10,880
Speaker 0: so enjoy You probably won't ever want to watch these again.

314
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:11,864
Speaker 1: Just so.

315
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:21,494
Speaker 1: also people know The guy who wrote the real Ghostbusters cartoon, you know, the one that was called the real Ghostbusters based on the good 1984 movie.

316
00:24:23,554 --> 00:24:25,189
Speaker 1: He writes many popular comic books.

317
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:27,727
Speaker 0: So, uh, what do you got for me?

318
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:33,492
Speaker 1: So there's you know, Japanese people they like toys Perhaps.

319
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:35,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this is all over the internet.

320
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:37,889
Speaker 1: You probably seen this already, but I thought it was pretty neat.

321
00:24:38,815 --> 00:24:42,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, some company made Obama action figure.

322
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:46,258
Speaker 0: I saw these a good idea.

323
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:47,722
Speaker 0: Yeah clever girl.

324
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:50,068
Speaker 1: So it's like a really good action figure.

325
00:24:50,088 --> 00:25:14,242
Speaker 1: It is very articulatable and You know, it's got all these different switchable heads, you know that look like Obama with different facial expressions and such and Someone I guess in Japan took this action figure and photographed it in many interesting scenes among which are Obama pulling out very dangerous weapons from under his coat.

326
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:20,283
Speaker 1: All right Obama with samurai swords Obama with a lightsaber fighting Darth Vader.

327
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:21,509
Speaker 0: now, is there?

328
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,836
Speaker 0: Obama versus Kenshiro?

329
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,100
Speaker 0: because I don't know who would win.

330
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,629
Speaker 0: we'd have to make it but I really don't know who would win.

331
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:42,518
Speaker 1: one Really good picture is Obama lying down with his hands, you know holding his head up, you know, like people do With his legs under a kotatsu with a bowl of oranges on the kotatsu And near his head is an old Famicom.

332
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:47,176
Speaker 1: I Don't think Obama.

333
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:52,370
Speaker 1: I mean Obama is a man of the world But I do not know if he has ever sat under a kotatsu.

334
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:57,370
Speaker 1: I in fact, I don't know if he would know what a kotatsu was if you said hey, do you have a kotatsu?

335
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:06,305
Speaker 1: But wherever I move next be it apartment or house Kotatsu is like number one on the list while I like kotatsu.

336
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:07,330
Speaker 0: I think they're an awesome thing.

337
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:11,089
Speaker 0: They really don't serve any purpose in a modern home.

338
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:12,132
Speaker 1: Why not?

339
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:15,261
Speaker 0: because the temperature is always perfect in the home,

340
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:18,390
Speaker 1: but you see what you do is you turn the heat off

341
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:20,377
Speaker 0: No, then your pipes freeze

342
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:29,550
Speaker 1: you keep the heat low and then you know Like hot enough to where the pipes won't freeze but like, you know, maybe like 50 something or low 60.

343
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:36,702
Speaker 0: So basically I make it so that the comfortable part of my house is very tiny and very comfortable and the rest of it Is inhale spittable wasteland.

344
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:45,115
Speaker 0: Yes Plus you realize Kotatsu were designed for if you're wearing Traditional Japanese clothes.

345
00:26:45,156 --> 00:26:48,790
Speaker 0: because think about it if you're wearing stuff like don't don't those come with the kotatsu.

346
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,338
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't know they must.

347
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:53,241
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

348
00:26:53,301 --> 00:26:53,883
Speaker 1: I thought they did.

349
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:55,990
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you have to have your own clothes.

350
00:26:56,478 --> 00:27:02,010
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, yeah But I mean like you're wearing normal pants and then as soon as you put your legs under the kotatsu goes poof and they change.

351
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,286
Speaker 0: You know Japanese pants, yes, that is exactly how it works.

352
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:06,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

353
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:09,699
Speaker 1: Anyway, what the hell you paying someone to money for.

354
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:12,610
Speaker 0: I want to get right into this actually because we're talking about.

355
00:27:13,053 --> 00:27:22,255
Speaker 0: it's one of those rare nights when we're talking about an Anime for which I have almost nothing bad to say like this Before we even go any further.

356
00:27:22,777 --> 00:27:29,570
Speaker 0: if you have never seen an anime called they were 11 Just go out and buy it and watch it.

357
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,796
Speaker 0: Don't even bother listening to the rest of this.

358
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:32,117
Speaker 0: it is.

359
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:37,150
Speaker 0: it is so worth seeing that I don't need to say it again.

360
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:38,316
Speaker 0: I shouldn't need to stress it.

361
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:39,844
Speaker 0: It is fantastic.

362
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:40,708
Speaker 0: You will enjoy it.

363
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:43,959
Speaker 1: Basically, I always knew about this right is?

364
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:52,359
Speaker 1: I always knew there was a thing called they were 11 and that the story was that there's a spaceship of some kind or a space station or people were in space.

365
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:56,650
Speaker 1: right and There were only supposed to be 10 people in space.

366
00:27:57,352 --> 00:28:00,001
Speaker 1: But when they got there there were 11 people.

367
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:01,546
Speaker 0: that's all most people knew.

368
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:02,670
Speaker 1: that's all I knew about it.

369
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,363
Speaker 0: They had it in the RIT anime library.

370
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:11,067
Speaker 1: There's some fans up Yeah, but no one and no one knows who the 11th person is, you know, so someone isn't supposed to be there.

371
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:13,532
Speaker 0: Yes, and The show.

372
00:28:13,552 --> 00:28:21,815
Speaker 0: well the movie because it is it's an animated movie a full feature movie pretty high-budget - is pretty unknown Very like.

373
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:25,310
Speaker 0: I've very rarely run into people who have heard of it let alone seen it.

374
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,896
Speaker 0: I hadn't seen it until recently.

375
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:28,442
Speaker 1: Well, I mean we you know, it's.

376
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:33,601
Speaker 1: it's one of those like, you know things You're gonna get from like a cheapo CPM DVD, right?

377
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:36,029
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's not made anymore in the US.

378
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,118
Speaker 1: I mean it was you know, it was made in the US.

379
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:38,962
Speaker 1: It was a CPM.

380
00:28:39,022 --> 00:28:40,710
Speaker 0: Didn't we buy this for like five bucks?

381
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:41,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, we bought it.

382
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:42,316
Speaker 1: next we did.

383
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:45,930
Speaker 1: we bought it for like, you know real cheap in some CPM discount bins.

384
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,890
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it was one of those, you know every DVD five bucks.

385
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,749
Speaker 0: That's when we bought all of master Keaton and we probably bought this too.

386
00:28:51,950 --> 00:29:00,377
Speaker 1: But I mean usually you go there right and you get these like cheapo DVDs and usually all bad right like judge or isn't bad?

387
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:03,573
Speaker 1: judge is awesome or Ayanis high kick.

388
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:04,135
Speaker 0: I honest.

389
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:05,118
Speaker 0: Hey kick isn't bad.

390
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:05,860
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

391
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:09,050
Speaker 1: Right, but they were 11 is like in the same bin.

392
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,517
Speaker 1: No, it's bad doomed megalopolis.

393
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:14,868
Speaker 1: So you see they were 11 in the same bin.

394
00:29:14,908 --> 00:29:15,670
Speaker 1: is these other things?

395
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,358
Speaker 1: so you kind of ignore it, but really it's sort of the Diamond in the rough.

396
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,782
Speaker 0: now the thing is I should have realized Much earlier because I would see the DVD laying around.

397
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:36,366
Speaker 0: but if you really look at it The character designs look very high-budget Like the DVD looks like one of those that can be deceptive because Odeon was also high-budget.

398
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:36,787
Speaker 0: Yes.

399
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:37,870
Speaker 0: Thus the conundrum.

400
00:29:38,953 --> 00:29:39,778
Speaker 1: But I budget.

401
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:41,650
Speaker 1: I mean that ride back show was high-budget.

402
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:45,590
Speaker 1: So this high production value even if not high-budget.

403
00:29:45,951 --> 00:30:01,330
Speaker 1: So they were 11. the original manga was by Hagio moto who is like super famous Shoujo purse, you know remember we talked about to Tara we talked about like Keiko Takamiya like, you know legendary groundbreaking revolutionary shoujo manga creator.

404
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:06,088
Speaker 1: Hagio moto is like one of the other ones that was in the same group the the 49ers.

405
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:25,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, the 49ers aka the showa 24 group because you know 1949 was the 24th year of the showa error Right, and basically these were the the ladies who sort of well not sort of did, you know Start shoujo basically and what we know now is shoujo.

406
00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:29,322
Speaker 0: And I gotta say if you look at the cover of the they were 11 manga.

407
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,570
Speaker 0: It looks pretty good.

408
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:42,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I mean like, you know nowadays not maybe not because that's what shoujo is But because that's what's published in the US and sold as shoujo in the US.

409
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:52,721
Speaker 1: you know people tend to think you know of shoujo stuff as you know pink and flowery and relationshipy kind of stuff, but All this early shoujo.

410
00:30:52,761 --> 00:31:02,784
Speaker 1: I'm seeing is all Sci-fi pretty much and all these early shoujo authors, you know for the showa 24 group we're all sci-fi and fantasy and an awesome in and up.

411
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:10,132
Speaker 1: and You know, it doesn't get a lot of respect over here in the US except among the smart fans, you know the score I mean the.

412
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:18,058
Speaker 0: the genres that are most often applied to they were 11 are Mystery romance and space opera.

413
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:20,765
Speaker 1: I think it's really a suspense kind of thing.

414
00:31:20,986 --> 00:31:27,727
Speaker 0: Well, that's probably in there too Yeah, but it is also definitely a mystery romantic space opera.

415
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:37,897
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, but the thing was is like he was sitting there and I kind of wanted to watch it for a long time Ever since we got the DVD, but every time I suggested hey, let's just watch it We just never watched it.

416
00:31:38,118 --> 00:31:48,750
Speaker 0: and it was that whenever we have a movie like this We kind of always want to wait until we have enough people to where if it's bad We can all make fun of it and if it's good I don't have to watch it a hundred times as I keep showing.

417
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:59,901
Speaker 1: I think the other thing is that we sort of expected it to be a quiet slow space movie Which it is a little bit, you know and Sort of some people don't like that as much as others like.

418
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:06,190
Speaker 1: I really like, you know quiet slow in space But other people sort of just get annoyed and grumble a lot.

419
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:11,489
Speaker 1: So, you know basically one day I was just home alone and I was like, you know what?

420
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:17,751
Speaker 1: Fuck it I'm just fucking watching this thing and I watched it and I thought it was gonna be good or at least I thought I would Like it.

421
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:19,617
Speaker 1: but when I got done watching it.

422
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:22,447
Speaker 1: leave ball not even but you know a little ways through.

423
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:25,958
Speaker 1: I was like wow This isn't just something that I'm liking.

424
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:28,126
Speaker 1: This is something everyone's gonna think is fucking awesome.

425
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,136
Speaker 0: Holy shit now The plot really like.

426
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:42,712
Speaker 0: if you watch this and we can't talk a lot about it because this is one of those Movies where there is a big reveal and then once the big reveal happens you can watch you can tell a lot though without the Reveal.

427
00:32:42,913 --> 00:32:49,449
Speaker 0: Yes, but it's one of those movies where it is a very different experience knowing what the deal was.

428
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,032
Speaker 1: Definitely, but

429
00:32:51,072 --> 00:33:06,910
Speaker 0: basically this is set in the far future and mankind is spread out throughout the cosmos and they have created a sort of University a school the elitist of the elitist of the elite the best and brightest that all of humanity and the other races they have encountered in their millennia.

430
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:10,923
Speaker 0: the very best of the best of the best the top of the top of the top.

431
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:18,730
Speaker 0: the people who Pat these are like These are already at this at this entrance exam the best people the universe has to offer.

432
00:33:18,971 --> 00:33:21,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the Oxford of the universe, right?

433
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:35,150
Speaker 1: so basically there's this entrance exam to get into the best University in the universe or the galaxy or whatever the fuck it is, right and They go on they get opens up and they the first thing they do is tell you about this exam.

434
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:48,736
Speaker 1: right and how like point one percent of the people who apply make it past the preliminaries and then like an even another small percent make it to the next stage right and then you know after that doesn't like 700 people left.

435
00:33:48,756 --> 00:33:51,910
Speaker 1: and we think this isn't just like earth which has six billion.

436
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,218
Speaker 1: I mean imagine if there was a test on earth, right?

437
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,136
Speaker 1: We're six billion people were on earth and 700 passed the test.

438
00:33:59,176 --> 00:34:08,810
Speaker 1: This is an entire galaxy or an entire universe of You know different planets of people living on them and 700 people make it past a certain point.

439
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:10,929
Speaker 1: That is hardcore, right?

440
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:17,889
Speaker 0: So we we begin in the midst of this exam following the sort of main character Tada.

441
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:22,264
Speaker 0: He was taking the exam and he's very nervous and he passes this preliminary part.

442
00:34:22,465 --> 00:34:24,150
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, he's basically in a sound.

443
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:29,594
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool how they execute this early part of how they get from the 10 to the 11.

444
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:31,350
Speaker 1: That's like so clever and amazing.

445
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:38,833
Speaker 0: I think it's worth noting that they will get to this but there's something that all of us everyone in the crew who watched it Did independently?

446
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:39,114
Speaker 0: Yeah.

447
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:41,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, we all realize we did it but he passes.

448
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:46,610
Speaker 0: so his booth opens up He walks out and he just gets instructions from a computer and he has to go.

449
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,830
Speaker 1: Everything is quiet.

450
00:34:48,011 --> 00:34:51,605
Speaker 1: Everyone else is still in their soundproof booths as least as far as you can see.

451
00:34:51,665 --> 00:34:52,969
Speaker 1: so he's all alone.

452
00:34:53,090 --> 00:35:04,790
Speaker 0: Effectively, even though there's all these people around taking the test and he goes through very intense security Like there is really no way for him to get through these doors get to these places without having passed this exam.

453
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:15,289
Speaker 1: Yeah He passes the exam and as soon as he passes the exam the computer in the soundproof booth gives him this card and he has To use that card to get through to the different doors to get out of there.

454
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:17,649
Speaker 1: And if he doesn't have the card, he's sort of stuck.

455
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:21,027
Speaker 0: So he goes through all this and the computer instructs him to do this.

456
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:22,995
Speaker 0: do that He's going on to the next test.

457
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:24,580
Speaker 0: He puts on a spacesuit.

458
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,764
Speaker 1: He puts on a spacesuit.

459
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:27,590
Speaker 1: So you can't see his face anymore.

460
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:35,304
Speaker 1: Well, they show him you his face, but you know because he's in a spacesuit, you know It has a shield to protect you from the Sun just burning your face.

461
00:35:35,364 --> 00:35:36,790
Speaker 0: terrible secret of space, right?

462
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,125
Speaker 1: You know other people in the show can't see his face.

463
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:48,507
Speaker 1: and he can't see their face Because the other people who also passed the test, you know these remaining 700 people They're they're all hidden in spacesuits.

464
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:48,749
Speaker 1: now.

465
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:51,077
Speaker 0: So he comes to a room.

466
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:55,130
Speaker 0: finally and in that room are nine other people wearing identical spacesuits.

467
00:35:55,230 --> 00:36:02,829
Speaker 1: And well first they're in a the room with the teachers telling them what's gonna happen And then they sort of call their numbers and then they go into another room.

468
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,279
Speaker 0: Yes so it's very methodical.

469
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:09,166
Speaker 0: everything comes together, but You get to a scene where there are ten people.

470
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:10,030
Speaker 0: and this is the point.

471
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:15,590
Speaker 0: It shows the people kind of standing around while they're getting their instructions and every one of us went one, two.

472
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:16,738
Speaker 0: Okay, there's ten.

473
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:17,383
Speaker 0: I see ten.

474
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:18,230
Speaker 0: They didn't trick me.

475
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:24,290
Speaker 1: There are ten spacesuits and there's one teacher and the teacher in the front, you know collects all their cards.

476
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:28,505
Speaker 1: So it's ten cards ten people in ten spacesuits.

477
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:31,690
Speaker 1: and then he says alright All of you are gonna go to this space.

478
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:36,190
Speaker 1: You know this ship that's floating in space and a wait further instruction and way further instruction.

479
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:43,790
Speaker 1: So all of these be you know, these are among the 700 best people in the galaxy, you know, they're not idiots, right?

480
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:47,010
Speaker 1: So they're all gonna just work together immediately and not be stupid.

481
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,825
Speaker 1: They don't need like, you know, someone to coddle them or hold their hand or anything, right?

482
00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:53,014
Speaker 1: So they're like, okay guys Let's all let's all go.

483
00:36:53,536 --> 00:36:55,583
Speaker 0: They go they get to the spaceship now.

484
00:36:55,603 --> 00:36:57,370
Speaker 0: They all go individually through space.

485
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,295
Speaker 0: They basically jump.

486
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:01,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do a little skywalk because they're real, you know.

487
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:05,001
Speaker 1: They basically fly them close to the spaceship and then they all do a skywalk.

488
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:07,870
Speaker 1: So they've never gotten out of their spacesuits.

489
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,540
Speaker 1: They've never seen each other's faces.

490
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:11,170
Speaker 1: They don't know what each other look like.

491
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:16,118
Speaker 1: They know there's ten of them at the present time But you know, that's all they know.

492
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,764
Speaker 0: so they get to the spaceship.

493
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:19,350
Speaker 0: They don't know what to do.

494
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,435
Speaker 0: They figure out a way in.

495
00:37:20,475 --> 00:37:22,464
Speaker 0: they get inside the powers out.

496
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:23,610
Speaker 0: They fiddle with it.

497
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:32,009
Speaker 0: They get the power going and then they start to orient themselves and then suddenly they realize That there are now eleven of them all in spacesuits.

498
00:37:33,491 --> 00:37:37,864
Speaker 0: So, I don't know if I even want to talk anymore about what happens but now definitely not thanks.

499
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:39,570
Speaker 0: They expect there to be ten.

500
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:41,310
Speaker 0: There are eleven.

501
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:43,038
Speaker 0: What do they do?

502
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:47,870
Speaker 0: And as soon as they're true Well, I'll say a little bit more just to kind of set the stage for what this is about.

503
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:56,530
Speaker 0: Yep, as soon as they realize like they start to figure out there's eleven They're starting to you know, not really panic, but they're they're all dealing with it in their own ways.

504
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,906
Speaker 0: They're trying to figure out what to do.

505
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:07,710
Speaker 0: there's the explosion and Basically what they learn what they are instructed is that the ten of them are have been put on this ship.

506
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:13,707
Speaker 0: They have to survive a number of days on their own with no help from the outside.

507
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:16,450
Speaker 0: No, nothing whatsoever No communication to the outside.

508
00:38:16,851 --> 00:38:21,444
Speaker 0: All they have is an emergency button that any one of them can press at any time.

509
00:38:21,886 --> 00:38:26,509
Speaker 0: and if anyone presses that button Someone will come immediately and rescue them all.

510
00:38:27,376 --> 00:38:28,826
Speaker 0: They will fail the exam.

511
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:32,409
Speaker 0: Yeah So they have come all this way like every one of these people.

512
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:36,650
Speaker 0: Their whole lives are riding on this like they are the best of this exam.

513
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:44,158
Speaker 1: Not only is this exam super hard right and for the super elite of the universe They only give the exam every three years.

514
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:47,249
Speaker 1: if you fail you're gonna have to wait three years to try again.

515
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:56,086
Speaker 0: So if anyone pushes that button or if any of the ten dies Yep, then they fail it's over.

516
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:56,629
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

517
00:38:57,413 --> 00:39:01,550
Speaker 0: And then immediately explosions started going off in the ship and the movie kind of takes it from there.

518
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:05,970
Speaker 1: So you have this like epic struggle for survival, right?

519
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,840
Speaker 1: But you know because they're in space and dangerous things happen in space.

520
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,127
Speaker 1: They're trying to survive for the number of days.

521
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:16,097
Speaker 1: They're also Constantly worrying about who is the traitor.

522
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:16,839
Speaker 1: who is the traitor?

523
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,250
Speaker 1: someone here has a nefarious purpose other than passing the test.

524
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:21,274
Speaker 1: But what the fuck.

525
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:24,750
Speaker 1: we can't do anything about it because you can't communicate with the outside world.

526
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:27,649
Speaker 1: We can't possibly figure out for sure who the traitor is.

527
00:39:28,258 --> 00:39:38,377
Speaker 0: When they all you know they take off their spacesuits and they all and there's you're not presented with 11 characters and one by one they all introduce themselves and Every one of them seems perfectly plausible.

528
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:39,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're all.

529
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,061
Speaker 0: and just as an example a small example of What it is that really like made this movie great.

530
00:39:46,222 --> 00:39:53,390
Speaker 0: I guess the biggest factor for me was that One of the characters has a little bit of psychic power which in the universe is not that uncommon.

531
00:39:54,157 --> 00:39:55,470
Speaker 0: He can tell if people are lying.

532
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,594
Speaker 0: So they all agree.

533
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,541
Speaker 0: All right, we'll try it.

534
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:02,369
Speaker 0: What are the odds that you're the traitor or whatever's going on?

535
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:10,388
Speaker 0: everyone tell your story to this guy and he'll say who's lying and they go through the whole thing and It starts to trip up on one of the guys.

536
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:17,389
Speaker 0: But he totally lies on purpose at first to see if the guy was lying himself and then he tells the truth.

537
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,637
Speaker 0: like Everyone is super confident.

538
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,966
Speaker 0: Everyone knows exactly what they're doing.

539
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:23,150
Speaker 0: Everyone's got their shit together.

540
00:40:23,411 --> 00:40:28,350
Speaker 1: I mean how many shows like where you know, all this drama happens because people are stupid, right?

541
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:33,795
Speaker 0: It's like every zombie movie where you know, we got to save the dog and then everyone dies Exactly in this movie.

542
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:35,139
Speaker 0: No one's saving the dog.

543
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,544
Speaker 1: These are the elite of the elite.

544
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:37,827
Speaker 1: So everyone is smart.

545
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:38,670
Speaker 1: Everyone is cool.

546
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:56,430
Speaker 1: Everyone is awesome even though they have disagreements and they fight over things and there's there is drama just because not because anyone's stupid but because they're an Incredibly difficult and stressful situation in space but their common purpose of passing the exam and not dying.

547
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:01,330
Speaker 1: You know, they managed to work together and it you know, it goes places.

548
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:05,243
Speaker 0: But the other thing that really drives this movie is that button.

549
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:09,230
Speaker 0: the button is almost like another character That's always there ready to strike.

550
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:16,889
Speaker 0: there are all these scenes where a character will like walk by the button and just stop and look at it or Someone goes over to hit it and then goes.

551
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:20,019
Speaker 1: They get into all these tough situations, right?

552
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:27,855
Speaker 1: They get tougher and tougher and tougher and it's like It's just like man, if I push that button We'll just be fine.

553
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:32,850
Speaker 1: You know, I'll live and everything will be cool and I won't have to deal with this bullshit anymore.

554
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:36,748
Speaker 1: but I'll fail and so will everyone else on this ship.

555
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:42,303
Speaker 0: and The movie just takes it from there and this movie.

556
00:41:42,444 --> 00:41:44,009
Speaker 1: It's like a how far will you go?

557
00:41:45,012 --> 00:41:46,198
Speaker 0: This movie is just so.

558
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:48,570
Speaker 0: I mean all the characters are really strong characters.

559
00:41:48,691 --> 00:41:50,949
Speaker 0: They all have interesting back some of them.

560
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:52,658
Speaker 1: I think it what that that is.

561
00:41:52,698 --> 00:41:59,523
Speaker 1: the one thing is that there are 11 characters But admittedly some of the characters don't do very much like the midget guy.

562
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:03,636
Speaker 1: He doesn't really come into it that much You know, there's the guy with the fro.

563
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:04,639
Speaker 1: he does nothing.

564
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:05,663
Speaker 1: the guy with the red fro.

565
00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:07,970
Speaker 0: He basically does one thing.

566
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:08,594
Speaker 1: What does he do?

567
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:09,500
Speaker 0: He does something.

568
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,225
Speaker 0: I don't want to spoil any.

569
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:11,412
Speaker 0: he does one thing They got.

570
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:12,659
Speaker 1: the red fro doesn't do anything.

571
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:14,228
Speaker 1: go with the big nose does one thing.

572
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,300
Speaker 0: The guy with the big nose also has red hair.

573
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,304
Speaker 0: That's almost in a fro.

574
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:19,910
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about the fro guy.

575
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:21,298
Speaker 0: Oh the fro guy.

576
00:42:21,378 --> 00:42:22,224
Speaker 0: Yeah, he doesn't do much.

577
00:42:22,264 --> 00:42:23,270
Speaker 1: He doesn't do anything, right?

578
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,290
Speaker 1: And I think maybe in the manga those characters might have, you know developed more.

579
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,490
Speaker 1: I've never read the manga so I don't know, you know.

580
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,663
Speaker 1: So I think that sort of they were in the movie because they were in the manga.

581
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:37,170
Speaker 1: but in the movie at least That's the only thing that I sort of rubbed me a little bit.

582
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:43,893
Speaker 1: That was not good was the fact that they had sort of extra characters in there that didn't develop or sort of mean anything You know.

583
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:49,050
Speaker 1: and some characters obviously the guy that they show you at the beginning Tada gets a lot more attention.

584
00:42:49,432 --> 00:42:52,264
Speaker 1: He's the main character compared to some of the other characters.

585
00:42:52,284 --> 00:42:52,987
Speaker 0: Well, plus look you.

586
00:42:54,012 --> 00:42:56,224
Speaker 1: But that's just the necessities of a movie.

587
00:42:56,244 --> 00:42:58,073
Speaker 0: But you as the audience I mean think about it.

588
00:42:58,113 --> 00:43:09,724
Speaker 0: you come into this from a meta perspective because you're gonna spend this movie trying to figure out what's going on and You as an audience member know that Tada passed the exam like he.

589
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:11,147
Speaker 0: he went with everyone else.

590
00:43:11,368 --> 00:43:12,230
Speaker 0: he did everything right.

591
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:18,690
Speaker 0: But the movie still instills you with doubt even though you saw him take the exam.

592
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:21,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you still start to doubt him.

593
00:43:21,277 --> 00:43:23,859
Speaker 0: Yeah you doubt everyone and you have no idea.

594
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:29,682
Speaker 0: and it it could plausibly be any of them because None of them is plausibly the 11th one.

595
00:43:30,003 --> 00:43:45,298
Speaker 1: and you start to think of all these wild Possibilities like maybe the school is evil and they purposefully like put 11 students and sneak one in You know, like maybe one student got a secret instruction to go on the ship, you know There's like actually a traitor.

596
00:43:45,398 --> 00:43:50,970
Speaker 1: or maybe there's something weird with this ship or maybe They do hint at a lot of weird stuff with the shit.

597
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:53,899
Speaker 0: I was going into this for about halfway through the movie.

598
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:57,149
Speaker 0: I started really thinking that they were all ghosts.

599
00:43:58,074 --> 00:44:00,266
Speaker 0: like I was starting to think like are they all ghosts?

600
00:44:00,568 --> 00:44:03,390
Speaker 0: and I really like it started to make sense.

601
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:04,042
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna.

602
00:44:04,165 --> 00:44:13,662
Speaker 1: obviously Maybe it was like an honest mistake like someone who is floating through space to a different exam because you know There are let's see 10 people 700 students.

603
00:44:13,923 --> 00:44:15,490
Speaker 1: I guess 70 exams, right?

604
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:18,249
Speaker 1: You know, maybe someone just floated in space to the wrong one.

605
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:21,669
Speaker 1: It's possible right and then they wouldn't know if they went to the wrong one.

606
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,142
Speaker 1: Would they the drop because they didn't see any of the people they were with.

607
00:44:25,403 --> 00:44:27,914
Speaker 1: so it's maybe some other one is like oh shit We have nine.

608
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:36,415
Speaker 0: Oh fuck but the drama really comes out because at any time They could snap their fingers and this problem would be resolved immediately but they would fail.

609
00:44:36,596 --> 00:44:40,049
Speaker 0: but the price would be so high that they have to deal with this on their own.

610
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:43,690
Speaker 0: and The movie just keeps upping the ante.

611
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:53,606
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean before I watched it when all I knew about it was the basic premise of there 11 people when they're supposed to be 10 in space.

612
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:54,190
Speaker 1: That's all I knew.

613
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:55,755
Speaker 1: I was like man.

614
00:44:55,775 --> 00:45:00,590
Speaker 1: that would make for a pretty good RPG scenario kind of thing, you know a little burning wheel something.

615
00:45:01,513 --> 00:45:02,455
Speaker 1: And having seen it.

616
00:45:02,475 --> 00:45:07,190
Speaker 1: I was I was right, but I was like way more right than I knew I was right.

617
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:07,893
Speaker 0: Yes, we're.

618
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:10,808
Speaker 0: I feel like this movie almost deserves a final thought show.

619
00:45:11,734 --> 00:45:14,410
Speaker 0: Maybe I have a lot to say about it, but I can't spoil crap.

620
00:45:14,871 --> 00:45:24,166
Speaker 0: all I want to say instead of do I can't do the all man this scene all man that scene because the Existence of certain scenes is in and of itself a spoiler.

621
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:29,070
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, definitely There was a point where we were confused about something and then it was revealed.

622
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:36,370
Speaker 0: But then it was revealed the opposite way a little bit later and then it was revealed.

623
00:45:37,872 --> 00:45:45,740
Speaker 0: But the scene that that stands out the most and when you all watch this you'll know destiny destiny all is destiny.

624
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:50,571
Speaker 0: That scene I Don't know.

625
00:45:50,591 --> 00:45:54,165
Speaker 0: this movie is just amazing and it has super high production values.

626
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:55,590
Speaker 0: The animation is really really good.

627
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,035
Speaker 0: The character designs are really strong.

628
00:45:57,075 --> 00:45:59,243
Speaker 0: It's based on this fantastic old manga.

629
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:00,346
Speaker 0: watch it.

630
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,096
Speaker 1: I Just hope they bring out the manga in English.

631
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:05,098
Speaker 0: I would definitely read it.

632
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:08,265
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, I really think we got it.

633
00:46:08,285 --> 00:46:08,710
Speaker 0: get one.

634
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,035
Speaker 0: We got to do a final thoughts on this.

635
00:46:10,075 --> 00:46:14,170
Speaker 0: and two we are definitely making this into a burning wheel scenario.

636
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:23,550
Speaker 0: so for all of you who are anime fans unless you come to a gaming con or Maybe kinetic on you probably won't see us run this but we were totally turning this into a burning wheel.

637
00:46:23,771 --> 00:46:32,477
Speaker 0: All I want to say is if you watch the movie and you go to a con where we are running a burning wheel event That sounds like they were 11.

638
00:46:32,477 --> 00:46:34,002
Speaker 0: It is they were 11.

639
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:35,426
Speaker 0: Don't spoil it for anyone else.

640
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:37,171
Speaker 1: So that's another thing though Right?

641
00:46:37,232 --> 00:46:37,332
Speaker 1: is?

642
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:40,130
Speaker 1: it's like I want to make a RPG scenario, right?

643
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:48,990
Speaker 1: But to make I feel as if I could give the RPG scenario a different twist, you know I'd still be a twist but a different twist than the movie, right?

644
00:46:49,871 --> 00:46:55,597
Speaker 1: But I feel like the twist for the movie is just so perfect and so great That I wouldn't want to do a different twist.

645
00:46:55,637 --> 00:46:59,249
Speaker 1: I would want to just steal that one, you know steal from the Forgotten Masters and whatnot.

646
00:47:00,232 --> 00:47:03,472
Speaker 0: But I know what's happening is like four twists I know.

647
00:47:03,552 --> 00:47:11,559
Speaker 1: but then what's happening is I'm spoiling the movie for anyone who does the RPG and Spoiling the RPG for anyone who's seen the movie.

648
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:15,510
Speaker 1: and I feel like you know, why why should it have to be that way?

649
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,821
Speaker 1: So it's it's it's a little.

650
00:47:16,842 --> 00:47:17,630
Speaker 1: we got to work on that.

651
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:36,581
Speaker 0: I don't have any reservations whatsoever because the overlap is not super great and I guess there will probably be a lot of people who will have seen they were 11 who would want to play in the game but I don't think there would be that many people who would play in the game and then independently later end up seeing the movie.

652
00:47:36,902 --> 00:47:50,318
Speaker 0: and even if they did if you as long as we skin it right I could see people playing our game and Then later seeing the movie and not immediately realizing they're identical Mmm-hmm, maybe if we use a different number.

653
00:47:50,378 --> 00:47:52,123
Speaker 1: besides 11 in the 11 is.

654
00:47:52,263 --> 00:47:54,530
Speaker 1: so I know it is a really good number.

655
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:56,239
Speaker 0: It's absolutely perfect.

656
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:56,862
Speaker 0: I don't like it.

657
00:47:56,902 --> 00:47:58,389
Speaker 1: I was thinking maybe 9 would work.

658
00:47:59,292 --> 00:47:59,896
Speaker 0: They were 9.

659
00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:01,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were a baseball team.

660
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:09,000
Speaker 1: Well, you know, they're supposed to be 8 and then a ninth shows up, you know 9 plus 1. no, they were supposed to be 8.

661
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,364
Speaker 1: So 9 is the plus 1.

662
00:48:10,364 --> 00:48:10,725
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

663
00:48:11,046 --> 00:48:12,410
Speaker 0: So what do we call this scenario?

664
00:48:14,435 --> 00:48:18,736
Speaker 1: They were 9.

665
00:48:18,736 --> 00:48:20,050
Speaker 1: You are 9.

666
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,357
Speaker 0: Seriously, you are shock.

667
00:48:21,578 --> 00:48:22,504
Speaker 0: You can explode.

668
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:25,598
Speaker 0: you can pick this movie up For nothing.

669
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:26,950
Speaker 0: It was put up by CPM.

670
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:33,219
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean the thing is if you don't go to like an anime convention where CPM sets up their ultra discount get rid of everything booth them.

671
00:48:34,352 --> 00:48:36,239
Speaker 1: You probably find on the Internet's no problem.

672
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,970
Speaker 1: But you know, I don't know go check like write stuff in Amazon.

673
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,274
Speaker 1: It's got to be there somewhere.

674
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,077
Speaker 1: It's so cheap.

675
00:48:41,378 --> 00:48:41,618
Speaker 0: Yes.

676
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:44,387
Speaker 0: I just I enjoyed this movie greatly.

677
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:48,239
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I don't know what else I can say because I really don't.

678
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,041
Speaker 1: it's a must watch.

679
00:48:49,342 --> 00:48:56,465
Speaker 0: it is especially because there aren't that many good Anime feature films out there like.

680
00:48:56,505 --> 00:48:57,430
Speaker 0: there's enough to wear.

681
00:48:57,731 --> 00:48:58,813
Speaker 0: They're few enough to wear.

682
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:07,276
Speaker 0: I would expect every self-identifying anime fan to have seen every major released in America Animated feature of length film.

683
00:49:07,297 --> 00:49:08,119
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

684
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,407
Speaker 0: So I expect all of you to have seen.

685
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:11,532
Speaker 0: they were 11.

686
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,825
Speaker 0: There you go, and we're gonna do a final thoughts at some point.

687
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:14,669
Speaker 0: So it's worth your while.
