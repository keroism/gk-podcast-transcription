1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,013
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday October 2nd 2019.

2
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,078
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:14,002
Speaker 0: that's good.

4
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:15,790
Speaker 0: And this is geek nights tonight.

5
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:19,769
Speaker 0: Promare studio triggers first feature film.

6
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:22,367
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,413 --> 00:00:37,209
Speaker 1: Okay, so as we have said in our previous few shows we had a huge huge huge pile of opening bits and newses and things of the day and Within one episode we completely forgot all of them.

8
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,401
Speaker 0: I remember like over the two weeks.

9
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:40,950
Speaker 0: We weren't doing shows like every day.

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,829
Speaker 0: I was like, oh if we were doing geek nights tonight, I would talk about this.

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,390
Speaker 1: I got like 20 opening bits and then up there all escaped my mind and I thought to myself the same thing.

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,750
Speaker 0: I always think I thought the exact words in my own brain.

13
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:59,287
Speaker 0: There is no way I will forget to talk about this when we resume geek nights.

14
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:00,250
Speaker 0: It's too good.

15
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:02,799
Speaker 0: There's no way I could possibly gone.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,568
Speaker 0: It's literally and it's gone my life.

17
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:08,705
Speaker 0: at this point I'm just like a fish like what happened to me in the last.

18
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:09,550
Speaker 1: so you can sit.

19
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:12,970
Speaker 1: If anyone's actually unwisely listening to this.

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,188
Speaker 1: Well now you can sit there wondering what all those opening bits that you will never hear were.

21
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:20,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we forgot the only one I didn't lose.

22
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:24,050
Speaker 1: Let's talk about things that went down just recently that I still remember.

23
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,446
Speaker 0: All I'll say is I when I t-bone that lady on my bike with her bike.

24
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:28,370
Speaker 0: I talked about that in the forum.

25
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:34,019
Speaker 1: okay, so first thing It's early October.

26
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,965
Speaker 0: So right.

27
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:37,499
Speaker 0: I got to make my Twitter Twitter avatar spooky.

28
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:38,805
Speaker 1: Oh, that's also true.

29
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:39,830
Speaker 0: I'll do that tonight.

30
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:43,285
Speaker 1: It's spooky season but also the spooky season is the time to go.

31
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:44,330
Speaker 1: get a flu jab season.

32
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:46,255
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Get your flu shot.

33
00:01:46,475 --> 00:01:51,230
Speaker 0: anyone who tells you you shouldn't get your flu shot except a doctor is wrong and anyone not doctor.

34
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,700
Speaker 0: No, I'm gonna be a real doctor.

35
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:53,929
Speaker 1: if you know anyone who?

36
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,602
Speaker 1: Didn't get a flu shot or his anti-vaxx or something and you know isn't.

37
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:01,010
Speaker 1: have a real reason like, you know weak immune system.

38
00:02:01,312 --> 00:02:03,062
Speaker 1: Yeah, get a flu shot sneak up on him.

39
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, give him the gym.

40
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:09,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you show up at PAX and you didn't get your flu shot do not fucking come near me.

41
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:09,788
Speaker 0: That's right.

42
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:18,455
Speaker 1: In fact, you're lucky I'm not in charge because we would just hold you down and jab you back when we do our and if you or exile you Know we should do the panel.

43
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:30,130
Speaker 0: We should start, you know, we do that like opening like hey everybody before we actually start the panel We should be like, hey Did anyone here not get their flu shot and then ask anyone who raises their hand to be removed from the room for our safety?

44
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:37,044
Speaker 0: Uh-huh You know, I'll bet they would but I feel like there would be consequences for us.

45
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,569
Speaker 1: something interesting would happen.

46
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would be that would be.

47
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,445
Speaker 0: something interesting would happen.

48
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:43,550
Speaker 0: That is the best way to put that.

49
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:46,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what happened to you in the last?

50
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,087
Speaker 0: like 12 to 16 hours?

51
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:55,901
Speaker 1: so my you know Not only did I move to a new apartment but shortly before that which I have not even been to yet immediately at well It's not it's not in great shape.

52
00:02:55,921 --> 00:03:03,223
Speaker 1: Yeah Immediately before that like as soon as I got back from packs I moved like, you know, like three or four weeks after that.

53
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:17,094
Speaker 1: right basically three weeks after packs, but Immediately after packs over Labor Day weekend my company moved to a different office where we had Like this crappy old office and then we our team was in like a separate temporary Bree.

54
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,968
Speaker 1: not we work but similar sort of thing.

55
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:24,187
Speaker 0: ish Right speaking of which you saw we weren't gave up on their IPO for now.

56
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:28,073
Speaker 0: good Broken up.

57
00:03:29,137 --> 00:03:31,768
Speaker 1: I mean there's better candidates breaking up, but why not them too?

58
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:35,990
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Many companies could be broken up anyway.

59
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:42,047
Speaker 1: So we finally combined the whole New York company at least into one office new office redone.

60
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:55,350
Speaker 1: Everything's nice You know and since it's a rather progressively minded company, they're doing lots of you know Improvements, you know related to like, you know being environmentally friendly and whatnot, right all that sort of thing, right?

61
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:04,808
Speaker 1: So one of the things really I work for the place that's like obsessed with that really small common thing is you know Some of the rooms have lights on motion detectors and lights turn off.

62
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:16,930
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh, there's one conference or my book kind of often but if I if there's only like a few people in it and we sit at the front after about 20 minutes the lights all turn Off and someone has to walk all the way to the back of the room to make the lights turn on again.

63
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,375
Speaker 1: So today I was sitting on the shitter.

64
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:26,228
Speaker 1: I Happened to me and the lights just turn off.

65
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:29,102
Speaker 1: Nobody came in to use the bathroom the whole time.

66
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:35,434
Speaker 0: I was sitting there playing reason the galaxy Yeah, and there's no sensor in the stall with you Wave your hand.

67
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:38,223
Speaker 1: So the way was pitch black.

68
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:40,270
Speaker 0: the words that wait, how do you wipe?

69
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:42,378
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I could.

70
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:43,889
Speaker 1: I felt around for the teepee?

71
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:48,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can't until you visually confirm like there is always risk.

72
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:53,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically But yeah, it's the least gross way to describe that problem.

73
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:59,947
Speaker 1: yeah I managed to you know, open the door wave my hand around.

74
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:03,609
Speaker 0: actually You know the worst thing about that would be if someone does come in.

75
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,324
Speaker 0: They come in like they used to open the door.

76
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:07,150
Speaker 0: It's pitch black.

77
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:09,398
Speaker 0: The lights turn on while they're in there.

78
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,271
Speaker 0: you come out of the stall and they won't have the context of the lights turned out On you.

79
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:17,886
Speaker 0: all they'll think is why was Scott alone in the dark in the bathroom?

80
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:21,370
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Anyway, so that happened.

81
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,139
Speaker 0: At least I can say that that is.

82
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,345
Speaker 0: that is literally happened to me Multiple times in my life at multiple employers.

83
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,208
Speaker 1: a first for me.

84
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:38,928
Speaker 0: This is why I don't want AI driven facial recognition technology to do a lot of stuff.

85
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:42,855
Speaker 1: yet I feel like if you're just gonna have the lights turn off in a bathroom You should make it a little smarter right?

86
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:46,350
Speaker 1: It's like it should also have detectors on the stall doors.

87
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:48,690
Speaker 1: The light should you know.

88
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:57,930
Speaker 0: I feel like this is like it's the same problem Microsoft had with the original Xbox because I assume the person they hired to design the controllers had gigantic monster hands.

89
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:05,770
Speaker 0: I feel like the person that designed all these sensors for bathrooms only has never had a poop that takes more than 20 seconds to complete.

90
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:15,382
Speaker 0: They've never played for race for the galaxies in the course of one poop Or would be a little much for means the poops a problem.

91
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:18,236
Speaker 1: so, you know, you got that the phone flashlight is Helpful.

92
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:19,188
Speaker 0: that is the good backup.

93
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,810
Speaker 0: So someone pointed out that there is an opening bit.

94
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,819
Speaker 0: We should have talked about and this was like of all days.

95
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,605
Speaker 0: today was the day to say this.

96
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,130
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm warm today.

97
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,502
Speaker 1: All right, it's like 90 degrees in October.

98
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:32,768
Speaker 1: It's actually a problem.

99
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:35,033
Speaker 1: It was Scott.

100
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:35,675
Speaker 0: the high today was 88.

101
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:35,936
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

102
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:37,842
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

103
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:38,726
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm?

104
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:39,970
Speaker 0: I'd looked at a thermometer.

105
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,115
Speaker 0: It was 88 today.

106
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:43,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wasn't that hot.

107
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:44,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was 88.

108
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,220
Speaker 1: Didn't feel that in October is warm, but it wasn't.

109
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,328
Speaker 0: and New York City is having a problem where people.

110
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,057
Speaker 0: It's summer.

111
00:06:51,097 --> 00:06:52,290
Speaker 0: So people are still going to the beach.

112
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,099
Speaker 0: But New York doesn't have like lifeguards at the beach.

113
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,242
Speaker 0: in October beaches closed Labor Day or shortly thereafter Yep, but it's so nice out.

114
00:07:00,363 --> 00:07:01,530
Speaker 0: people are still going to the beach.

115
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,024
Speaker 0: They're just ain't lifeguards or like parking attendants.

116
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,030
Speaker 1: I mean you're allowed to go there.

117
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,915
Speaker 1: You just you know, you go into the water sort of like no one's gonna physically stop you from going in the water But you're not supposed to.

118
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:12,190
Speaker 1: yeah, but surfer is usually go in the water.

119
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,014
Speaker 0: I feel like it this weekend.

120
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,399
Speaker 0: Maybe I should go to the beach go swim.

121
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,002
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

122
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:16,810
Speaker 0: You only the water will start to get cold.

123
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:26,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's actually I learned from surfers There's a website called like magical seaweed and that website tells you basically where and when to surf like.

124
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:26,550
Speaker 1: this is like.

125
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:30,750
Speaker 1: You know like oh, it's sort of like how you're always checking that the snow on the ski mountains.

126
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:32,735
Speaker 0: Yeah, no Who's got the good snow today?

127
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:36,246
Speaker 1: magical seaweed is like good waves here bad waves there.

128
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:37,570
Speaker 1: go to this beach go, you know.

129
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,599
Speaker 0: Yep, that is I assume that exists.

130
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:41,288
Speaker 0: I assume there's a mountain bike one.

131
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,253
Speaker 0: Like oh, yeah Here's where they go.

132
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:44,869
Speaker 0: I guess mountain biking doesn't matter as much just is a sunny go.

133
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,785
Speaker 1: No, it's not a sport where you need conditions.

134
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:51,246
Speaker 0: true Yeah, surfing and skiing are the ones you really need very specific conditions for.

135
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:53,634
Speaker 0: it can't eat like skiing It's not even just is it cold?

136
00:07:53,935 --> 00:07:58,629
Speaker 0: It's like is there enough of the right kind of snow in this one place right now?

137
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,269
Speaker 0: Surfing are there waves like this and is the temperature like this right here right now?

138
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:09,079
Speaker 0: I Don't know how it works.

139
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:09,905
Speaker 1: It's magical seaweed.

140
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:14,666
Speaker 0: If I lived somewhere else, I would probably take up surfing instead of skiing.

141
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:20,223
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm okay I'm totally down to surf cuz it's not doesn't seem dangerous or too dangerous in any way.

142
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,470
Speaker 0: It's more dangerous than skiing.

143
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:23,825
Speaker 1: I mean, I know I don't think so.

144
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:30,490
Speaker 1: The thing is is that you know, the the cartoon image of surfing which actually is real people do surf.

145
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,159
Speaker 1: I'm like enormous enormous waves.

146
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,030
Speaker 0: Why would you surf unless that's your end goal?

147
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:39,929
Speaker 1: But be able to do the vast majority of surfing is on waves way smaller and not dangerous at all.

148
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:47,400
Speaker 0: I mean case in point, you know There are a lot of the surfing happens in the US in fucking Wildwood with those tiny little two-foot waves.

149
00:08:47,441 --> 00:09:01,527
Speaker 1: the super giant wave surfing that you know You imagine is like the stereotypical surfing is pretty rare and only in a few places And only with expert be I get the impression people are actually more likely to die like hiking.

150
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:08,654
Speaker 0: I Think skiing is safer than surfing, but I can't find like enough evidence to make that case Specifically.

151
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,518
Speaker 0: Mmm.

152
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:16,482
Speaker 0: I think skiing is less dangerous than surfing though I mean depends cuz drowning is way more likely to happen.

153
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:19,710
Speaker 0: then like skiing dying is pretty rare.

154
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:24,225
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna say how many stories of professional surfers do you hear dying?

155
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:25,068
Speaker 1: and there's more than zero.

156
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:25,570
Speaker 1: I've heard some.

157
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:36,770
Speaker 1: I've heard a lot actually But I've heard a lot more stories about professional skiers Like even in the early during the Olympics like crashing into some trees breaking all the bones in their body.

158
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:38,602
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty uncommon though.

159
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:40,315
Speaker 1: I See it happen.

160
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:41,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, not that often.

161
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:45,770
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, you got any anime news on this anime Wednesday?

162
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,018
Speaker 1: I just got too small anime new.

163
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,910
Speaker 0: I too have small anime news's of two.

164
00:09:51,411 --> 00:10:02,810
Speaker 1: Okay, so the first small anime news is that they're making a Lupin the third Computer-generated animation movie which is actually really old news, right?

165
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,561
Speaker 1: But there's now trailers for it and the cast and the plot.

166
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:07,544
Speaker 0: Oh, it looks good.

167
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,690
Speaker 1: It actually looks pretty damn good.

168
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,438
Speaker 0: It looks really like I'm feeling this.

169
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:22,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a. so this trailer is way hot The music is hot the the plot seems to be a typical Lupin plot where he's trying to steal something that has some sort of semi-supernatural.

170
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:37,150
Speaker 0: You know DaVinci Code powers Lupin as a franchise for a while basically up until The Fujiko mean anything that sort of reset it again a lot of Lupin things that were coming out.

171
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,896
Speaker 0: We're not actually that good for a while.

172
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:46,609
Speaker 1: This appears at face value to follow the Lupin movie formula Of you know, the great upon the third movies.

173
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,896
Speaker 0: Well, I mean look at your normal cast but it's us plus the girl who's only in this movie the plot girl And the one movie villain.

174
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:55,602
Speaker 1: and you know, it's like.

175
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:56,204
Speaker 1: it's like.

176
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:58,980
Speaker 1: yeah, it's cookie cutter, but it is all new But it's a good cookie.

177
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:02,120
Speaker 0: Yeah Shit out of me a good bunch of sugar cookies.

178
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,848
Speaker 1: the CG looks actually pretty great.

179
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:07,779
Speaker 1: Yeah So I'll wait to see this when it's all subtitled.

180
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,441
Speaker 1: and all that biz.

181
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:11,832
Speaker 0: Did you ever actually finish Fujiko mean a no Really?

182
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:12,735
Speaker 0: It's a real good.

183
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:12,996
Speaker 1: Yeah.

184
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:15,144
Speaker 1: Well, I got there's a lot of things that are real good.

185
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:16,248
Speaker 1: I'm gonna watch one day.

186
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,340
Speaker 1: How am I watching so much more anime than you?

187
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,845
Speaker 1: cuz maybe I do things besides.

188
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:21,869
Speaker 1: sit around watching TV.

189
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:23,261
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do a lot.

190
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:27,418
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Speaking of what I've been doing I don't spend very I don't.

191
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,510
Speaker 1: I spend very little time in front of the the screen watching shit.

192
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:42,261
Speaker 0: So speaking of what I've been doing This is a geek bite because I have finished all of Carolyn Tuesday the hot new Watanabe like bones anime music oriented.

193
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:43,304
Speaker 0: It's not covered.

194
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:44,407
Speaker 1: You only watched half of it.

195
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:49,090
Speaker 0: Well, so The first half of it is on Netflix completely.

196
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:59,070
Speaker 0: They just released the whole thing and it ends at a very good like stopping point because the story is sort of a. The first half of the show is how did these two people become famous?

197
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:00,229
Speaker 0: Like how did this happen?

198
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:04,570
Speaker 0: And then the second half of the show is what do they do now in this world?

199
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,046
Speaker 0: That it's basic like ice like American ice?

200
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:09,131
Speaker 0: are Gestapo Like?

201
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:13,405
Speaker 0: is it basically a plot point around immigrants and refugees and all they like?

202
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,030
Speaker 0: there's a real serious plot.

203
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,210
Speaker 1: What about this other anime we're gonna review in our main?

204
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:26,596
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah There are two anti ice movies or shows that have come out and read like around the same time with Actually kind of the same message.

205
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:29,122
Speaker 0: at least that message interleaves with all the other messages.

206
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:31,308
Speaker 0: We'll get to that in Carolyn Tuesday.

207
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:32,190
Speaker 0: It's mice.

208
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:42,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not even pretending Literally like refugees from Earth like moving to Mars and an anti refugee politician like it's.

209
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,010
Speaker 0: it's really direct.

210
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:45,490
Speaker 0: They're not fucking around here.

211
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:53,950
Speaker 0: but so the second the show is still like being finished and The second half of it will drop on Netflix sometime soon.

212
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:59,789
Speaker 0: I forget what day it's gonna come But basically you can watch the first half of it on Netflix now and it ends at a pretty good point.

213
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:03,724
Speaker 0: Having watched it all I'm gonna say like I'm gonna spoil anything.

214
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:04,688
Speaker 0: This is a geek bite one.

215
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:08,490
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna be one of the great anime.

216
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:16,262
Speaker 0: Like I get the feels why having watched the first half of this that I got the first time I watch shows like cowboy bebop.

217
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:17,370
Speaker 0: It just feels real good.

218
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:24,870
Speaker 0: I find myself rewatching certain scenes a bunch of times on YouTube, which I also find myself doing with things like cowboy bebop.

219
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:30,130
Speaker 0: The music in it because it's a show about musicians is great.

220
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:35,949
Speaker 0: There's a lot of songs that are done very well, which is where music anime tend to fuck up and fail.

221
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,345
Speaker 0: It's big-budget like everything about.

222
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:47,293
Speaker 0: it is great and If you wanted kids on the slope to be good, but you thought it was boring because it was boring It wasn't going anywhere.

223
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:52,690
Speaker 0: This is actually good and you should 100% watch the show as soon as you can.

224
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,214
Speaker 0: That's all I'm gonna say.

225
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:57,004
Speaker 1: So when we judged anime, we were correct.

226
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:58,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were a hundred percent correct.

227
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:07,169
Speaker 0: In fact, I think it's better than we thought it was gonna be because I didn't know Where it was going and where it's going, I don't know what it does.

228
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:09,059
Speaker 0: with that I mean the second half could fuck it up.

229
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,070
Speaker 0: Don't feel like it's gonna fuck it up.

230
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,456
Speaker 0: I feel like they know what they're doing.

231
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,179
Speaker 0: Hmm.

232
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:18,500
Speaker 1: Also, uh dubstep grandma Whatever that is is good.

233
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:19,749
Speaker 0: Oh the tooth it.

234
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:26,770
Speaker 0: You know how a lot of anime are funny and that they have jokes But you don't actually laugh out loud at any point cuz they're not that funny.

235
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:31,870
Speaker 0: I laughed out loud a lot at this show kind of like when I watch cowboy bebop.

236
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:39,789
Speaker 0: But the points I think you specifically Scott will laugh out loud are the dubstep grandma and the mermaid sisters.

237
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,863
Speaker 1: The mermaid sisters, when are they coming over?

238
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,170
Speaker 0: I Would go if the mermaid sisters were a real band.

239
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,050
Speaker 0: I would fucking go to their concert like no, I would stand in line to get tickets to see them perform live.

240
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:54,299
Speaker 1: No one sells tickets and lines anymore.

241
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,450
Speaker 0: I'm did obviously a digital line obviously.

242
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:00,969
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what's your other anime news?

243
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,950
Speaker 1: Oh, well You know There's this convention in New York called anime NYC that we've talked about every year since it came into existence And we've been to it zero time.

244
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:12,862
Speaker 0: We never go because either it overlaps with some of like some geek nights thing We got to do or some travel or something.

245
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:13,730
Speaker 0: It doesn't overlap with shit.

246
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,557
Speaker 1: we can totally go to it.

247
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:15,706
Speaker 0: a few times that overlapped.

248
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:21,290
Speaker 0: or As the producer of geek nights or I'd like I arrange all of our convention appearances.

249
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,730
Speaker 0: I keep fucking forgetting to talk to them and sort stuff out until it's way too late.

250
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:31,312
Speaker 0: Cuz there's way too many taxes for me to deal with like I'm I've.

251
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:32,578
Speaker 0: you know how many packs is.

252
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:35,290
Speaker 0: I've had to schedule for us in the last like two weeks.

253
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,299
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's at the Javits Center for November 15th to 17th.

254
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,506
Speaker 0: It is the facts of anime conventions like.

255
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:45,264
Speaker 1: it's real big It's not you know, just based on you know on paper.

256
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:46,750
Speaker 1: It does have some issues.

257
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:57,549
Speaker 1: I think they do some VIP biz, but you're not a big fan of Right, but in general it seems to be a great giant anime con in New York City, you know.

258
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:00,529
Speaker 1: It's not run by read, right?

259
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:03,386
Speaker 1: You know, it sort of broke away from.

260
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:06,710
Speaker 1: you know It's a lot of those people who were involved in that New York anime festival.

261
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,037
Speaker 1: They busted away.

262
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:25,973
Speaker 0: I think we talked about this way back when this first came out, but yeah It's like an a-team of the kinds of people who worked for the companies that made anime conventions or volunteered for Anime conventions right who wanted to do the right thing and the conventions were stupid and basically they formed the power team of all Those people

263
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:34,659
Speaker 1: anyway, so there are already been a lot of huge guests announced for this year's but it's November 15th to 17th For this year's anime NYC.

264
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:41,060
Speaker 1: They've already announced a ton of huge guests including Kill Em All to me know creators of the Dr.

265
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:54,570
Speaker 1: Stone manga the illustrator of Monogatari A voice actress named Miku Ito, I don't know You know, but as I get older, I honestly pay less attention to the voice actors.

266
00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:08,950
Speaker 1: You know a jam project and a bunch of other musical guests are gonna be there Right, but they just announced a big-time Japanese voice acting guest who has never ever even once appeared at a US convention.

267
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,598
Speaker 1: So only the weebs are gonna know.

268
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,290
Speaker 1: Yeah about Rie Kukimiya.

269
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:19,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's see Alphonse from Fullmetal Alchemist, Happy from Fairy Tail.

270
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:24,650
Speaker 1: Have you seen any of these other anime that this person has voice acted in?

271
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,730
Speaker 0: No, I know they're popular, but these are not my anime, right?

272
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,890
Speaker 1: It's like this is a very other than Fullmetal Alchemist and Gintama.

273
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:38,890
Speaker 1: I've never seen an anime this person voice acted in but I can still recognize like this person is way big deal.

274
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:43,127
Speaker 0: Oh, they also do Oda Nobunaga in Fate Grand Order.

275
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:50,362
Speaker 0: Okay If you do not know What that is, it's not the Oda Nobunaga you're thinking of.

276
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:50,964
Speaker 1: No, it is not.

277
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:53,921
Speaker 0: But it actually technically is it's.

278
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:58,559
Speaker 0: uh anyway There are many Oda Nobunagas.

279
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:06,448
Speaker 1: Right, the point is this is like a big-time Guest announcement right never before and I wish they would have gotten the person to

280
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:06,649
Speaker 0: do

281
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:14,468
Speaker 1: The Japanese voice of Edward Elric, whoever that is Because I misread this post at first and was about to be like

282
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:22,141
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, actually that that segues nicely into my news.

283
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:24,266
Speaker 1: I was about to make a funny tweet, but I couldn't.

284
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:28,542
Speaker 0: yeah, so People have been asking me to summarize this.

285
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:29,387
Speaker 0: you can just read it.

286
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:43,155
Speaker 0: The bad talked about it a little bit on gig nights But basically Vic Mignona the guy who voice-acted Edward Elric and a whole bunch of other characters across a bunch of popular anime in America Terrorized many anime cons.

287
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:51,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, uh kind of in my personal opinion based on my interactions with him and my Discussions of him with other people who have had first-hand interactions with him.

288
00:18:52,205 --> 00:19:07,410
Speaker 0: He's kind of a piece of shit like he's an annoying demanding kind of shitty dude who always gave off bad vibes and as you all know It looks like he was also a creepy person and did a bunch of creepy stuff and you can read all about it here.

289
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:24,576
Speaker 0: I don't want him to sue me because seems like I keep suing people but he sued a bunch of people in the industry because His complaint was they fired him because he's a creep and that is defamation and slander and all that kind of crap He lost.

290
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:27,090
Speaker 0: like that lawsuit went nowhere because it was ridiculous.

291
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:33,569
Speaker 0: he hired a lawyer who is Basically the Lionel huts of this kind of thing.

292
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:36,560
Speaker 0: Like the guy fucked up real bad.

293
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:38,486
Speaker 0: the whole situation was disaster.

294
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:39,650
Speaker 0: the lawsuit was a mistake.

295
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:47,424
Speaker 0: But the thing that happened that you should all know from the anime industry perspective and anime news perspective Is that the lawsuits basically over.

296
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:48,250
Speaker 0: he did lose.

297
00:19:48,731 --> 00:20:02,006
Speaker 0: there's like one last thing that's gonna happen where he's gonna fail in this mediation thing and then it's done, but the mob of Weeb's who are weirdly obsessed with him is a real fucking problem.

298
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,656
Speaker 0: now in anime There's more of them than you think.

299
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:07,670
Speaker 0: they're basically doing a hundred percent the gamer gate thing.

300
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:15,769
Speaker 0: They've been harassing the judge in the case Like directly like vandalizing his Facebook wall and stuff.

301
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:19,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, like judges looking at his Facebook wall often.

302
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:21,658
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but think about this.

303
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,329
Speaker 0: the weebs are organized the judge even knows.

304
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,798
Speaker 0: uh So we'll see what comes of that.

305
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:27,742
Speaker 0: because they're.

306
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:29,730
Speaker 0: they're sending death threats all over the place.

307
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:32,258
Speaker 0: They're using hashtags just like gamergate did.

308
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:35,830
Speaker 0: they're doing mass like reporting antics on Twitter.

309
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:37,596
Speaker 0: They're going after people on Facebook.

310
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:38,439
Speaker 0: They're doxxing.

311
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,930
Speaker 0: It is literally just another gamer gate mmm, and it's growing.

312
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,430
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's like 20 of those happening that you don't even know about.

313
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:47,069
Speaker 1: Oh, there aren't that many in circles that you don't even know.

314
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:49,478
Speaker 0: they tend to focus the.

315
00:20:49,979 --> 00:21:01,090
Speaker 0: those things tend to focus on nerd franchises and Partly because there are a lot of aggrieved shitty incel type white dudes who are really easy to trick with this stuff.

316
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:05,449
Speaker 0: so It's basically all over.

317
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:15,750
Speaker 0: But what you got to watch out for is that this mob is going around like attacking and harassing people and I think they're gonna Get a little more potentially violent and angry when the final verdict happens.

318
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:30,510
Speaker 0: If you run an anime convention all I'm saying is anyone that you are booking to do panels Anyone that you are interacting with in the industry Just check their social media tags and make sure they're not interacting with the I stand with Vic hashtag.

319
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:33,900
Speaker 0: That is literally just gamer gate for anime.

320
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:37,490
Speaker 0: if they even are adjacent to that just hard pass block them and move on.

321
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:43,266
Speaker 0: And if you want to know more about like the full details of this ridiculous clown circus that happened.

322
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:49,109
Speaker 0: I will link to this CBR article that talks in depth about all the ridiculous crap that happened.

323
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:51,757
Speaker 0: It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.

324
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:56,910
Speaker 1: hmm and one final news that is unrelated to any anime manga or comics.

325
00:21:57,331 --> 00:22:01,947
Speaker 1: Whoa, but today is October 2nd, which is the first day of hockey.

326
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:07,854
Speaker 1: Oh shit In 2019, I'm a 20/20 season.

327
00:22:07,874 --> 00:22:09,136
Speaker 0: I feel like here we go.

328
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:15,641
Speaker 0: Should we do our next Tuesday show on The preview of the upcoming hockey season or something.

329
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:16,022
Speaker 1: What do you?

330
00:22:16,082 --> 00:22:16,504
Speaker 1: what the fuck?

331
00:22:16,524 --> 00:22:18,170
Speaker 1: Do you know fucking nothing?

332
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:21,041
Speaker 0: I got you know, I've got I have nothing to do shit.

333
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:21,302
Speaker 0: Oh, wait.

334
00:22:21,322 --> 00:22:22,044
Speaker 0: Wait, here's what I got.

335
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:23,690
Speaker 0: I have uninformed conjecture Mm-hmm.

336
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:24,835
Speaker 0: I have.

337
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:28,450
Speaker 1: can you even name players on other teams besides the Red Wings or the Rangers?

338
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,046
Speaker 1: No, really name for me one player on the Nashville Predators predators.

339
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,947
Speaker 0: Oh Did they trade him?

340
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:40,999
Speaker 0: I'm worried that the people anyone I would mention has been traded.

341
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:42,123
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna say now.

342
00:22:42,705 --> 00:22:44,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you have no place.

343
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,433
Speaker 1: season preview Scott.

344
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:49,059
Speaker 0: I'm doing a Rangers preview.

345
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:57,510
Speaker 1: if you need any sort of preview or any sort of hockey info You should go to respected sports journalists who are full-time paid sports journalists.

346
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:03,030
Speaker 1: Yeah doing this all day and not to rim who knows next to nothing.

347
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:07,630
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying if you want unfounded and uninformed conjecture, let's do a different show.

348
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:13,410
Speaker 1: You want someone who talks 90% about the Rangers who just make stuff up because you don't know nothing.

349
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,209
Speaker 1: And what you're gonna do is read something and repeat what you read.

350
00:23:17,674 --> 00:23:19,170
Speaker 1: I probably could have just read that to begin.

351
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,570
Speaker 0: I think the other thing I would actually talk about for the entire time is the rules changes.

352
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,440
Speaker 1: We can talk about the rules.

353
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,850
Speaker 0: actually that would be a good Tuesday show.

354
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,099
Speaker 1: That is the thing that we can talk.

355
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,469
Speaker 0: that would be a really good Tuesday show.

356
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,730
Speaker 0: Yes, remind us on Monday because I've already forgotten what we were gonna do this show on.

357
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:36,570
Speaker 1: You can do a show about all sorts of sports rule changes.

358
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:37,877
Speaker 0: Oh, that would be a good.

359
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:38,923
Speaker 0: that would be a good panel.

360
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:39,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, like in a PAX.

361
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:42,550
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm gonna put that in for PAX East.

362
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:52,110
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day what he got.

363
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:57,667
Speaker 1: so here's a bunch of baby alligators right already cute I guess Scott the fuck.

364
00:23:57,948 --> 00:23:58,129
Speaker 1: Hmm.

365
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,080
Speaker 1: These are not alligators crocodiles, whatever all same shit.

366
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,240
Speaker 0: There's a big difference between an alligator and a crocodile.

367
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:07,588
Speaker 1: Fuck you alligators crocodiles.

368
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:08,612
Speaker 1: I'm putting you together.

369
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,780
Speaker 0: Fuck alligators crocodiles are where it's at.

370
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:12,770
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is you picked the right one.

371
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,640
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of babies Scott.

372
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,344
Speaker 0: Do we need to play?

373
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:16,934
Speaker 0: is it Ireland or is it Scotland again?

374
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,739
Speaker 1: No, I don't care.

375
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,090
Speaker 1: They're all the same.

376
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:19,616
Speaker 1: now deal with it.

377
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,109
Speaker 1: Now golf and Barney stones and deal with it.

378
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,900
Speaker 0: Oh god, I'm glad you at least got one of each there.

379
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:49,710
Speaker 1: Difference between the United Britain and Great Britain, so these baby Floridians here Make albion ease they make a bunch of cute noises and it just so happens that in this video They're making these cute noises and they sound Incredibly like a Galaga machine.

380
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:52,240
Speaker 1: I love shockingly like a Galaga machine.

381
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:57,840
Speaker 0: I love it when cuz you know There's animals that people encounter a lot of their lives like doggos.

382
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,592
Speaker 1: I feel like I should have just taken a Galaga machine and dubbed it over.

383
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:01,475
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would have been.

384
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:05,913
Speaker 0: we could do that Galaxian doo-doo-doo-doo.

385
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:15,220
Speaker 0: But I love it when animals that Normal people don't encounter on a regular basis make a noise that normal people would not expect them to make.

386
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:18,750
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's you know, people learn the cow goes moo.

387
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,773
Speaker 1: The duck goes quack.

388
00:25:19,793 --> 00:25:29,000
Speaker 1: They don't realize that the Fox the Fox goes right, sometimes There's a bunch of animals and no one ever fucking teaches you what sound they make, you know, the whale goes.

389
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:32,312
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like, you know, what the fuck noise does?

390
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:33,799
Speaker 1: uh, I don't know.

391
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:37,287
Speaker 1: Fucking Rhino make mmm.

392
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much right?

393
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,531
Speaker 1: That's you.

394
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:39,233
Speaker 1: That's a good guess.

395
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's probably right, but you don't fucking know that That would be.

396
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:43,011
Speaker 0: there's a game.

397
00:25:43,051 --> 00:25:44,000
Speaker 0: There's an interview question.

398
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,940
Speaker 0: Just get someone to make all the noises of every animal in alphabetical order.

399
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, weird-ass animals and I bet the thing is it's probably a bunch of animals that do make a noise.

400
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:54,740
Speaker 1: We just don't know what fucking noise they make because it's too small, right?

401
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,615
Speaker 1: I bet if I was spider size, I would be like, oh spider goes.

402
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:03,256
Speaker 0: so Rabbits you think they don't make noise right like that like they don't yell or anything.

403
00:26:03,276 --> 00:26:04,340
Speaker 0: They don't have like a barking noise.

404
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, they make noise.

405
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:05,626
Speaker 0: Like what?

406
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:05,867
Speaker 0: What do you?

407
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:06,791
Speaker 0: what noise do you think they make?

408
00:26:07,113 --> 00:26:07,756
Speaker 1: Oh, they got little.

409
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:08,620
Speaker 1: they go teethy noises.

410
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:09,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, when they're biting stuff.

411
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:12,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll thump when they're mad where they want attention.

412
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:14,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, they can vocalize.

413
00:26:14,528 --> 00:26:17,359
Speaker 0: usually they only do it when they're extreme pain or distress of some kind.

414
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:21,050
Speaker 0: Some weird rabbits just yell because they're weird not common.

415
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,989
Speaker 1: I was actually reading something recently that was like yeah cats didn't vocalize They meowed because of humans.

416
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if that's true or not.

417
00:26:28,681 --> 00:26:30,907
Speaker 1: I read a thing that is recent.

418
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:35,200
Speaker 0: claim that that is recent very like very fascinating research actually.

419
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:44,167
Speaker 0: so My thing of the day is actually related to this because rabbits do make these tiny little vocalizations That you wouldn't hear.

420
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:53,394
Speaker 0: unless you're like really up close and really paying attention Like Moogie when he's eating stuff and he's excited you'll hear these tiny little like Mmm, like he gets excited.

421
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:57,003
Speaker 0: So this channel Basically mics.

422
00:26:57,164 --> 00:27:01,760
Speaker 0: they mic up their rabbit with a really sensitive microphone and it's basically rabbit ASMR.

423
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:07,700
Speaker 0: Like here's the rabbit eating a watermelon and you just get like the sounds of a rabbit eating a water.

424
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,269
Speaker 1: We got two animal noise things of the day.

425
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,493
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're telling me remember the old days We used to do like week-long themes of things of the day.

426
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:16,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't have that many spare things of the day.

427
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,239
Speaker 0: I remember when we did hockey fights for a week.

428
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the internet now has you know, a lot less cool things of the day and a lot more bad news Yeah, or a lot more.

429
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:31,218
Speaker 0: This is a cool thing of the day But it's literally just the next video from the guy who I've already used for like eight things of the day.

430
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:33,545
Speaker 0: Yep Like the Tecmoan guy.

431
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,091
Speaker 0: I'm trying to avoid linking to him.

432
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:36,758
Speaker 1: Product testing guy.

433
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:42,339
Speaker 0: Yep There's I feel like maybe we should do a show on that like where do we get our long-form cut like the like?

434
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,480
Speaker 0: what?

435
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,266
Speaker 0: Are there really are reliable go-to?

436
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:44,888
Speaker 0: show me something.

437
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:47,638
Speaker 1: interesting channels every kpop music show.

438
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:50,038
Speaker 1: Yeah Be hey test kitchen.

439
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:56,295
Speaker 0: In the meta moment the geek nice book club book is still the tale of Genji.

440
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:59,665
Speaker 0: not just a novel but The first novel.

441
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:00,427
Speaker 1: yeah, I haven't.

442
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:08,187
Speaker 1: I've started reading it and I was making some moves and then I moved and I haven't started reading it again, so once Everything in my apartment is settled.

443
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:11,380
Speaker 1: I'll probably be able to like, you know get in bed and start reading again.

444
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,933
Speaker 0: Yep, so, uh still be a long one before we get into the.

445
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:20,820
Speaker 0: it's also a long book Yeah, because we're going full hardcore on a bridge.

446
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,800
Speaker 0: But I know Bridgman having read a bit of it when you said you were reading it.

447
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:37,717
Speaker 0: I've paused now because you paused but I Get the same feeling I got when I was reading the long on a bridge count of Monte Cristo in the sense that yeah It's long but stuff just keeps happening and I'm always just like all right.

448
00:28:37,737 --> 00:28:38,721
Speaker 1: All right All right.

449
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:43,680
Speaker 1: Well, you have to remember this thing was originally released as like several separate chapters.

450
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:48,660
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the count of Monte Cristo was like here's a chapter in the newspaper every week exactly.

451
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,480
Speaker 1: So this was you know, and this was only like for rich people, right?

452
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,140
Speaker 1: Because I guess other people even how to read yeah, or you couldn't get definitely couldn't get books and paper.

453
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,132
Speaker 1: It's not like that a pretty press or whatever, right?

454
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:04,440
Speaker 0: So Yeah Yep, the other about big metabit because we do know there's a lot of stuff going on.

455
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:17,894
Speaker 0: But the thing I really want to point out because it's Wednesday is that many of you in fact someone is in the live stream agitating right now asking us what we think of pro mayor because if you've noticed the format of geek nights is we talk for like 20 ish minutes about

456
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,223
Speaker 1: Bullshit.

457
00:29:19,263 --> 00:29:19,445
Speaker 1: Yeah.

458
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:32,500
Speaker 0: Well stuff that is either bullshit or That's really only relevant now and like you don't care about this if you listen to this episode Ten years from now right when this someone is listening to this in some year.

459
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,989
Speaker 1: well, well into the future from 2019 if the world still exists.

460

Speaker 1: and They're listening all this pre-promare stuff like what the fuck?

461
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,487
Speaker 1: but really they're just wondering if they should watch this movie promare Which is now readily available on the.

462
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:48,700
Speaker 1: you know, I guess one dollar a month every old anime ever.

463
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:49,626
Speaker 0: Well, I case in point.

464
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:56,980
Speaker 0: on December 28th 2005 on geek nights we reviewed samurai Champloo like we talked me to review.

465
00:29:58,182 --> 00:30:07,360
Speaker 0: We also talked about some windows exploit from 2005 and how it looks like blu-ray might win the fight against HD DVD.

466
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:10,247
Speaker 1: You're right Blu-ray did win the fight and then it lost.

467
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:10,669
Speaker 0: you don't?

468
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:15,911
Speaker 0: you do not want to hear us talk about the blu-ray news You just want samurai Champloo.

469
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:16,514
Speaker 1: That's right.

470
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:28,500
Speaker 0: So what I'm doing and I posted a bunch of these already and I'm gonna like put one of these out like once a week for a long time because We've reviewed a crazy amount of anime over the last 15 years of doing geek nights.

471
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:37,915
Speaker 0: So I'm taking just the main bits from those episodes just the reviews I'm pulling them out and I'm uploading them both to YouTube and to the patreon.

472
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,078
Speaker 0: So well, you don't have to any money It's free.

473
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,807
Speaker 0: I'm not making these like hidden behind the paywall.

Speaker 0: So I've already uploaded four of these and I'm gonna try to do one once a week.

476
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:15,613
Speaker 0: So I did our Evangelion review our Evangelion final thoughts our big o final thoughts and a movie that neither of us remember at all that we reviewed Called the boy who saw the wind Mm-hmm.

477
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:22,257
Speaker 0: So I think next what I'm gonna put up is uh, actually, I'm not gonna spoil it They'll just appear in the feed as they appear.

478
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,107
Speaker 1: So promare we finally get to it.

479
00:31:26,227 --> 00:31:26,448
Speaker 1: Yes.

480
00:31:26,488 --> 00:31:27,250
Speaker 1: Well, here's the deal.

481
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:37,083
Speaker 1: right studio trigger the makers of such fine anime as Kill-la-kill little witch academia Etc.

482
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:37,565
Speaker 1: Etc.

483
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:38,168
Speaker 1: Etc.

484
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:39,977
Speaker 0: The studio that saved anime.

485
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:46,318
Speaker 1: Yes They've made a move a full-length Animated motion picture.

486
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:54,373
Speaker 1: now This is our first one and as we say if there's an anime movie in the theater That's not a sequel even if it's just like brooms.

487
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:55,477
Speaker 1: You should go sooms.

488
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:08,480
Speaker 0: Yeah There aren't that many anime movies that are feature length full of production value Released in theaters and are not a sequel to like Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh or not like one piece movie 12 or some shit like that.

489
00:32:09,102 --> 00:32:17,955
Speaker 1: The second, you know compilation movie of existing anime TV series Yeah, ones that are original stories, you know things like that.

490
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,180
Speaker 1: They're pretty rare.

491
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:25,380
Speaker 1: So if you're if you're an anime fan, you know It might be hard to go back in time and watch all of them.

492
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,294
Speaker 1: But you should go back in time and watch all the great ones.

493
00:32:27,374 --> 00:32:28,200
Speaker 1: It won't take that long.

494
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,943
Speaker 1: There's not too many.

495
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:31,852
Speaker 0: and if you live in a major city in America in the u.s.

496
00:32:32,354 --> 00:32:33,939
Speaker 0: They're all in the theater, right?

497
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,867
Speaker 1: It used to be that you know back in the day You could only see them really at like.

498
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:41,480
Speaker 1: in New York at like we used to go to like IFC or stuff like that.

499
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:58,720
Speaker 1: Right, but now thanks to what it called the fathom events and whatnot You know a small company a small distributor like G kids or Funimation can now through that fathom events Put their movie on the screens in theaters around the country for like one or two nights only.

500
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:02,714
Speaker 0: So it's not even like oh go to Manhattan to the weird theater one night only.

501
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:06,427
Speaker 0: it's like go to the movie theater We normally go to in Queens.

502
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:14,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went to just a normal old multiplex that shows all the you know But it's like are they showing the dub on one night and the sub two nights later, and that's it.

503
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:15,124
Speaker 0: They got you back.

504
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:15,827
Speaker 0: They know what's up.

505
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:16,469
Speaker 0: They know.

506
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:17,755
Speaker 0: Yep, so you can go see this.

507
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:23,294
Speaker 1: the sub which is the May or may not have missed your chance to see it in the theater in the.

508
00:33:23,595 --> 00:33:24,720
Speaker 0: I saw some.

509
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,409
Speaker 1: There are still some screenings out there.

510
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,895
Speaker 0: I believe in some markets.

511
00:33:28,935 --> 00:33:34,455
Speaker 1: They extended promirs Theatrical release because I think it's made like a million dollars.

512
00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:43,180
Speaker 1: the US box office It's doing well as far as doing well for a extremely limited run and non-english anime movie in the u.s.

513
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:50,533
Speaker 0: Yep, so before we get into the like the full review the TLDR version is just go see it Of course, like just automatically just go see it.

514
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:58,186
Speaker 1: even before I saw it I would tell you that because we said it's an anime, but now that I've seen it go see it Seriously like.

515
00:33:58,508 --> 00:34:01,160
Speaker 1: so all I knew is that this is a movie by studio trigger.

516
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,980
Speaker 1: So I know expectations based on what I know about studio trigger.

517
00:34:06,482 --> 00:34:09,011
Speaker 1: But this basically is even be like.

518
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:14,230
Speaker 1: not only did it meet the expectation It basically was too on target.

519
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:16,739
Speaker 1: It is literally studio trigger the movie.

520
00:34:17,143 --> 00:34:22,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the way it put it They just went in they went all in on what they are good at and who they are.

521
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:23,498
Speaker 1: They didn't try to do anything new.

522
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:28,634
Speaker 1: They just did what studio trigger does as hard as they possibly could.

523
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:31,241
Speaker 0: it's like the opposite of what happened with Mary and the witch's Flower.

524
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:33,989
Speaker 0: it's like hey, we're gonna make a Ghibli movie but not be Ghibli.

525
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,560
Speaker 0: and they made a not that good Ghibli esque movie.

526
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:40,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this is literally like Scott said it best.

527
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,418
Speaker 0: This is studio trigger the movie and if they made a premiere - I would go see it.

528
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the way I would describe it before we even get into details.

529
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:59,698
Speaker 0: Is that is you know like an anime movie has like the of the first act the twist the second act the big Climaxi scene and then the denim on.

530
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:04,557
Speaker 0: Take that big climax II seen and literally make that the entire movie and never fucking stop.

531
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:11,399
Speaker 0: pretty much There's like a few scenes where it slows down a little and they're not even that long.

532
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:14,091
Speaker 0: This movie just it.

533
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:18,368
Speaker 0: it just shoves Anime into your face as hard as possible.

534
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:24,726
Speaker 0: take the biggest action scene in giant Robo and make that an entire movie Mm-hmm, and I loved every second of it.

535
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:30,503
Speaker 0: The other thing is it's the plot is there are firefighters What is nothing.

536
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:35,298
Speaker 0: the plot is there are firefighters and there are fire terrorists?

537
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:41,980
Speaker 1: Yep Well the whole world the plot is actually something weird happened that we don't can't explain.

538
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:56,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, where some people were suddenly on fire The war the entire world the entire world got set on fire literally and the post-apocalyptic You know reborn society firefighting is really there are still some fire people around.

539
00:35:57,145 --> 00:35:57,872
Speaker 1: So there are.

540
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:19,489
Speaker 1: but you know The societal structure has basically firefighters who go out and deal with the fire-causing people as well as a Gestapo a separate Gestapo like police force that arrests the fire people and prisons them and then that Gestapo Literally starts arresting people who are obviously Immigrants effectively.

541
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:20,658
Speaker 1: Yes, they have like it.

542
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:34,959
Speaker 1: Yeah They use ice weapons Literally, yep, and and if you're a non-white worker in a restaurant making pizza He's making the best pizza and all he wants to do with his firepower is make the best pizzas.

543
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:40,300
Speaker 1: And then they find out that he is a you know fire person and they come and arrest him.

544
00:36:40,942 --> 00:36:47,307
Speaker 1: He's working there making pizzas like if you know all the racist people in the restaurant are like Oh, I don't like this pizza anymore and leave.

545
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:49,474
Speaker 1: there is firefighters who aren't races.

546
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:53,932
Speaker 0: There is zero Ambiguity that it is ice ice.

547
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:55,299
Speaker 1: No, but yeah, it's.

548
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:58,098
Speaker 1: uh The plot is not much of a plot.

549
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:01,831
Speaker 1: Well the plot so it's basically the plot.

550
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:04,780
Speaker 1: in a mood to set things on fire and have giant robot.

551
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:12,033
Speaker 0: yep, but the plot in terms of like forget the anime something like What the major characters are doing and why.

552
00:37:12,053 --> 00:37:15,827
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's complex But it's more than you would expect.

553
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:20,120
Speaker 0: like the villain has fairly complex and interesting motivations.

554
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:25,197
Speaker 0: Like more so than I expected Scott did you ever actually see all of giant robo?

555
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, said.

556
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:41,228
Speaker 0: all I'll say if you have seen giant robo the end and like what the real plot is and like the final moments of this movie are so so parallel Directly to the end of giant.

557
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:41,830
Speaker 1: I don't think it's.

558
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:44,020
Speaker 1: actually I don't think it comes from giant robo.

559
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:50,524
Speaker 1: I think it just comes from the same source material as giant robo, which is old giant robot animes Yeah, but more the like.

560
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:51,526
Speaker 0: what did you?

561
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:52,148
Speaker 0: it's that?

562
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:56,579
Speaker 0: What did you expect me to do with this moment from giant robo?

563
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,727
Speaker 0: Similar sort of situation in from air.

564
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:00,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean this.

565
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:06,707
Speaker 1: similar sort of situations in like, you know, Gigantor and messenger and whatever From the same cloth.

566
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, but giant robo really crystallized it.

567
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:09,536
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

568
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:15,960
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Yeah, not this is not a spoiler even though it is a thing that happens near the end of the movie.

569
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,447
Speaker 1: This is a movie where a robot that is so enormous It the entire earth is on fire.

570
00:38:22,788 --> 00:38:27,300
Speaker 1: This robot punches the on fire earth and the entire solar system sets on fire.

571
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:31,811
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is a thing that happens in this movie.

572
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:34,400
Speaker 1: It's not a spoiler because what the fuck can you make of that?

573
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:38,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's the kind of movie you're going into, you know.

574
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:48,740
Speaker 0: So, you know in the gun drill through the earth insanity or you know Like the open like giant robo starts in media res it literally just starts with this crazy train and a giant action.

575
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, this starts with after they explain the history of the world briefly.

576
00:38:52,342 --> 00:38:56,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, this building on fire the firefighters are going with their robots to fight the fire.

577
00:38:56,401 --> 00:39:10,771
Speaker 1: Yep, and all the fire like hydrants on the street are actually like little mecha City is very Evangelion nerve city where the whole construction of the city is designed to help fight fires Every same way that you know the nerve city or whatever.

578
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:13,239
Speaker 1: It's called Tokyo seven random fucking.

579
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:13,520
Speaker 1: remember.

580
00:39:14,082 --> 00:39:18,665
Speaker 0: Every character is a ridiculous over-the-top Character of something like they're.

581
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,977
Speaker 0: they're as ridiculous as you could possibly imagine and a lot of them use.

582
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:29,059
Speaker 1: they're basically Transplanted characters from other trigger anime which I like is like there's like the big dude.

583
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:35,000
Speaker 1: Yeah Gamagori is gamagori and then you know the sciency girl who handles all the tech stuff.

584
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:39,720
Speaker 1: It's obviously just the hat girl from kill la kill all those characters in the firefighting team.

585
00:39:40,202 --> 00:39:46,288
Speaker 0: I was getting these vague like bubblegum crisis vibes a little bit Like it almost made me want to go watch bubblegum crisis again.

586
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:53,600
Speaker 1: Well the also the the chief guy with the mustache Yeah, you know plus all the vehicles gave me a lot of tank police vibe.

587
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:02,300
Speaker 0: Especially there is literally a scene where a fire truck starts rolling through a hallway that is narrower than the truck.

588
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is like the iconic scene in tank police.

589
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:08,438
Speaker 0: well the second most iconic scene the most iconic scene is all the penises.

590
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:19,999
Speaker 0: but This movie is Just ridiculous and over-the-top to the point that I am hesitant to try to describe anything about it beyond that.

591
00:40:20,682 --> 00:40:23,693
Speaker 1: Well, I also got to point out, you know, this is for all the the people's out there.

592
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:26,745
Speaker 1: this movie is pretty gay Yes, but it.

593
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:27,910
Speaker 0: but here's the important point.

594
00:40:28,171 --> 00:40:31,785
Speaker 0: There is no romantic subplot No, which I'm very.

595
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:32,768
Speaker 0: that is refreshing.

596
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:36,500
Speaker 0: There is a female love interest and a male love interest.

597
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:42,635
Speaker 1: There is a brief scene where they obviously The camerawork is done in such a way to make you think up.

598
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:51,828
Speaker 1: main character, dude Who's gonna kiss, you know, the hot girl that is also a firefighter and like she likes him Basically just gets on his motorcycle and drives away.

599
00:40:51,848 --> 00:40:58,291
Speaker 1: and then there is another scene where it's like, oh he's good Oh, he's gonna give you know, it's.

600
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:05,510
Speaker 1: it's that old mouth-to-mouth resuscitation situation You know, but there's basically it's.

601
00:41:06,273 --> 00:41:12,574
Speaker 1: it is inferred in such a way as like yes There's something there and they don't make it explicit with the main character.

602
00:41:12,614 --> 00:41:14,420
Speaker 0: is that either gay or bisexual?

603
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:16,167
Speaker 0: It's openly right.

604
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:27,567
Speaker 1: it's a shame that they don't make it more explicit But they clearly though, you know via the it is unspoken that like yeah He is not interested in that girl.

605
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:28,771
Speaker 1: He's yeah, I stayed in.

606
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:31,120
Speaker 0: you know, I guess what I what is refreshing.

607
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,231
Speaker 0: I'm glad it wasn't

608
00:41:32,272 --> 00:41:45,980
Speaker 1: darling in the franks Yeah, which I haven't even watched but I know that like yeah There's a dude and the girls all bent over in front of him here the two dudes combined in the robot Not that the girl doesn't combine in the robot with the other dude, yeah, okay the two dudes combined in the robot.

609
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:49,774
Speaker 0: But I'm glad there's no romantic subplot only in the sense that I hate that.

610
00:41:49,795 --> 00:41:51,240
Speaker 0: that just is in everything.

611
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:55,559
Speaker 0: Always the fact that it's not actually a subplot and it's just about these people.

612
00:41:56,121 --> 00:42:00,375
Speaker 0: But at the same time their attraction to each other is not in any way hidden.

613
00:42:00,997 --> 00:42:01,659
Speaker 0: It's just there.

614
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:07,760
Speaker 0: It's also a movie like I almost want to just send this to my dad and be like, hey, it's a movie about firemen.

615
00:42:08,046 --> 00:42:08,374
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

616
00:42:10,385 --> 00:42:11,330
Speaker 0: It technically is.

617
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:13,080
Speaker 1: but no this is it just.

618
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,824
Speaker 1: Firefighting is merely the you know facade for which it is a you know Tactical.

619
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:23,375
Speaker 0: they literally fight fires superhero team.

620
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,440
Speaker 0: They fight fires with.

621
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:32,654
Speaker 1: It's like it's like if you just repainted gatekeepers and put like a fire Emblem FDNY on the side of the gatekeepers vehicles.

622
00:42:32,694 --> 00:42:33,860
Speaker 1: that doesn't make them firefighters.

623
00:42:34,862 --> 00:42:39,256
Speaker 0: The other thing I really appreciated was that it's such crazy over-the-top action.

624
00:42:39,296 --> 00:42:54,816
Speaker 1: the colors are Amazing like the colors the lines like everything about those aesthetic and how they managed to combine the CG Right and the you know, the the regular non CG animation in such a way, right?

625
00:42:54,856 --> 00:42:58,209
Speaker 1: That is it not the way that Spider-man spider-verse does it?

626
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, right like a new and different way.

627
00:43:01,781 --> 00:43:04,371
Speaker 1: It's pretty you know, it just has.

628
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:06,558
Speaker 1: there's like tons of energy in it.

629
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:06,920
Speaker 1: I don't know.

630
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:13,188
Speaker 1: the one thing is What was I gonna say in the early part of the movie?

631
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:22,600
Speaker 0: the city itself looks very CG and sterile And I fed to the point that I thought that was on purpose and there was gonna be a plot around that which there wasn't.

632
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:34,199
Speaker 0: No, but otherwise like it just looks so good and in the midst of all this chaos That what is actually happening on screen still like makes sense.

633
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,046
Speaker 0: Which a lot of thing.

634
00:43:36,086 --> 00:43:42,355
Speaker 0: a lot of anime and even live-action movies that try to go crazy like that Tend to lose this like Transformers movies.

635
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,100
Speaker 0: the perfect example.

636
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:45,254
Speaker 0: It doesn't actually make sense.

637
00:43:45,314 --> 00:43:45,919
Speaker 0: What's happening?

638
00:43:46,620 --> 00:44:00,360
Speaker 1: I mean if you will go on Twitter, right, you know an anti Twitter people often post like these gifts of Like a brief cut from an anime to show you like the insane Animation in that sequence that somebody did by hand way back in the day, right?

639
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:16,943
Speaker 1: You'll always feel like the one from Matt cross where it's like, all right the plane They're fighting outside the macros and then they're in the city and then they transform and then they chase and then right and then You know There's also the scene where like they're falling and the cockpit opens up and they fall out and then they come back in and he grabs And closes it right.

640
00:44:17,044 --> 00:44:30,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like these, you know, if you watch those old anime that have these scenes in them It's like most of that show will be the cheapest barely moving Cut, you know low-budget animation Yeah, just talking heads and stuff like that.

641
00:44:31,249 --> 00:44:35,382
Speaker 1: And then during the action scene, they'll have this one Sequence.

642
00:44:35,402 --> 00:44:36,947
Speaker 1: they put tons of effort into that.

643
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,796
Speaker 1: You can then clip and make an animated gif for Twitter.

644
00:44:40,037 --> 00:44:40,880
Speaker 1: That will be amazing.

645
00:44:41,141 --> 00:44:44,492
Speaker 1: Wow, look at that incredible animation this entire movie.

646
00:44:44,773 --> 00:44:51,952
Speaker 1: You could basically pick any Starting and stopping point and the whole thing will be You know Twitter gif worthy.

647
00:44:52,073 --> 00:44:57,215
Speaker 1: it's just non-stop anime Twitter gif of amazing animated action sequence.

648
00:44:57,315 --> 00:45:11,775
Speaker 1: also, I cannot stress enough the Absolutely bumping soundtrack and if it ever pauses for a moment and there's no action instead you get like breathtaking Beautiful still background kind of every frame of this movie would be a fine desktop background.

649
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,279
Speaker 0: Yes, every single frame.

650
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,060
Speaker 0: Yeah But the music is fantastic.

651
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:23,539
Speaker 1: It's the same composer that you heard, you know and kill la kill and all the others Yeah trigger things with that same kind of energy.

652
00:45:23,841 --> 00:45:32,028
Speaker 0: But the animation is like really set against the music very well and the music is varied Within the confines of the movie.

653
00:45:32,108 --> 00:45:38,160
Speaker 0: Yes, wait, like to the point that I've just been listening to the soundtrack at work So it's on YouTube.

654
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:50,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing along all those lines is that despite all this nonsense and like all this crazy crazy There's a ton of humor and like little jokes and like Little bits that would be easy to miss.

655
00:45:50,729 --> 00:45:58,507
Speaker 0: and the movie and I really really appreciate this because it's so rare They trust you to just notice this shit It's so fast.

656
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:00,580
Speaker 1: If you you have you don't notice it, you're gonna miss it.

657
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:08,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like the movie trusts you to notice all these really little jokes without going back like hey Did you get the joke?

658
00:46:08,244 --> 00:46:08,485
Speaker 0: Did you?

659
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:09,248
Speaker 0: did you get it?

660
00:46:09,468 --> 00:46:17,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I mean that's the thing is like it moves crazy fast But it's not crazy fast like Excel saga, or what was that other one?

661
00:46:17,737 --> 00:46:18,640
Speaker 1: That was crazy fast.

662
00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:24,680
Speaker 0: Oh the one that the one we're god, this is so long ago the elf princess rain.

663
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:30,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that right where it's not just like who the fuck listening to geek nights remembers elf princess rain.

664
00:46:30,661 --> 00:46:31,930
Speaker 1: Is that I'm so calm so smart.

665
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:32,172
Speaker 1: Yep.

666
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:32,715
Speaker 0: That's the one.

667
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:35,006
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it's crazy fat.

668
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:35,548
Speaker 0: There's another one.

669
00:46:35,568 --> 00:46:44,780
Speaker 1: We forgot that has a similar thing, but it's not like this ridiculous Breakneck speed that it's like, you know, you're listening to a record and it's spinning too fast.

670
00:46:44,921 --> 00:46:46,640
Speaker 1: You can't tell what any what the lyrics are.

671
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,564
Speaker 1: It's like it's going.

672
00:46:47,946 --> 00:46:50,999
Speaker 1: it's like a podcast on 2x where you can get all the words in.

673
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,720
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's still fast, but you 100% can tell everything that was said and it's perfectly clear.

674
00:46:57,142 --> 00:47:01,560
Speaker 1: You don't you know you and I guess you might miss some things if you don't pay enough attention or you slip.

675
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,802
Speaker 1: You know you doze off or get distracted But otherwise is Totally good.

676
00:47:06,943 --> 00:47:12,240
Speaker 1: and they managed because of that speed to cram in a ton of stuff, right?

677
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,275
Speaker 1: I didn't feel like there was anything that was like that they introduced.

678
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:17,700
Speaker 1: that was lacking screen.

679
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,182
Speaker 1: It's not like.

680
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,049
Speaker 1: it's not like oh not too many characters.

681
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,294
Speaker 1: not not enough characters.

682
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:27,180
Speaker 1: Just right number of characters Just right number of you know scenes and twists and things like that.

683
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,960
Speaker 0: I'm like every side character as crazy as they are has just enough screen time for you to enjoy that character.

684
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:41,370
Speaker 0: yep, even like really minor characters like they get enough and Everyone's like rotten tomatoes like this movie is making money.

685
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:42,113
Speaker 0: It's like.

686
00:47:42,153 --> 00:47:44,220
Speaker 0: the reviews are all great for the most part.

687
00:47:44,704 --> 00:47:46,079
Speaker 0: What did anime news network say?

688
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:52,920
Speaker 0: Promare is a refinement of the trigger formula to the point where I honestly believe it has outdone the classics that inspired it.

689
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:53,702
Speaker 1: Yeah problem.

690
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:58,900
Speaker 1: The only thing I can say about this movie that would be negative besides the fact that the plot is basically nothing.

691
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:00,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just anime.

692
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,300
Speaker 1: plot the anime, right?

693
00:48:04,342 --> 00:48:10,400
Speaker 1: I love anime plot the anime, but relatedly I think if you're just like I like Guy Ritchie movie the movie, right?

694
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,200
Speaker 1: I think if you are not anime fan the weeb this movie will just be like what the fuck.

695
00:48:15,421 --> 00:48:18,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz just movie will just just blast right?

696
00:48:18,635 --> 00:48:26,820
Speaker 0: It might blow you away right Yeah, but then I don't think you're going to be like if you did a non anime person.

697
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,333
Speaker 0: It'd be like a hurricane rolled through and you're like just throwing around.

698
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:31,758
Speaker 0: You know, what was that?

699
00:48:31,798 --> 00:48:32,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, then it ends.

700
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,994
Speaker 1: You're just like what right whereas an anime fan would be.

701
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:36,241
Speaker 1: it's like well It's.

702
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:42,238
Speaker 1: imagine two people riding a roller coaster and one person's like, whoa roller coaster And the other person's like, oh my god, what the fuck is this?

703
00:48:47,387 --> 00:48:51,560
Speaker 1: Compare this to red line and then one person gets off and it's like that was awesome.

704
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,317
Speaker 1: Another person gets off and it's like what the hell was that?

705
00:48:54,181 --> 00:49:02,894
Speaker 1: Compared to red line, which is a pretty I was also thinking about red line But I think red line red line is a more actually sit like a normal movie.

706
00:49:02,994 --> 00:49:07,747
Speaker 1: right red line is crazy is more Speed up and slowed out right?

707
00:49:07,807 --> 00:49:10,177
Speaker 1: It's not full speed the whole movie.

708
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:14,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It's like they're the scenes where the racing and crazy erasing act.

709
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,280
Speaker 0: But then there's the scenes were like the characters are developing and having a quiet night, right?

710
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,857
Speaker 1: And then there's talking in between right and there's a whole lot of setup before the race and stuff like that.

711
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:25,727
Speaker 1: Yeah It's just not to be fair.

712
00:49:25,827 --> 00:49:33,980
Speaker 0: red line to red line actually has a pretty nuanced like Set of character arcs and the plot is actually pretty complete more complex.

713
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:39,418
Speaker 1: And red line has a plot that is way more advanced than the plot of pro hair, which is which is just nothing.

714
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:47,240
Speaker 0: Yep But if I takes if I take like random person and show them red line, they'll understand it as a movie.

Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's already.

747
00:51:36,876 --> 00:51:43,900
Speaker 0: like world was on fire Why like that's the plot and at the end you will know why the world burned down, right?

748
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,570
Speaker 0: And it's actually a pretty interesting plot.

749
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:48,999
Speaker 0: That was more than I expected it to be.

750
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:50,686
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not.

751
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:53,739
Speaker 1: you know, you're not getting any meaning or no you could.

752
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:57,392
Speaker 0: It's one of the aspects of this movie is actually very relevant.

753
00:51:57,412 --> 00:52:02,530
Speaker 0: Well, two of the aspects are very relevant to current-day Like real-world problems.

754
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:07,646
Speaker 0: the two things I'm thinking of are one Anti-immigrant anti-refugee like bullshit.

755
00:52:07,747 --> 00:52:16,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, and number two rich people wanting to give up and start over and leave all the pores behind Instead of using those resources to fix the world.

756
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:16,971
Speaker 0: Yes.

757
00:52:17,192 --> 00:52:21,285
Speaker 0: Those are two very core very real themes in this movie But they are just they're.

758
00:52:21,365 --> 00:52:23,172
Speaker 1: they're just like put right out there.

759
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:27,825
Speaker 0: Yeah, the plot is just Anti-immigrant people are bad.

760
00:52:27,846 --> 00:52:29,951
Speaker 1: There is no Jeff Bezos bad.

761
00:52:29,971 --> 00:52:31,796
Speaker 1: There is no subtlety whatsoever.

762
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,364
Speaker 1: There is no Right.

763
00:52:34,504 --> 00:52:35,468
Speaker 1: It's literally just.

764
00:52:35,508 --> 00:52:36,632
Speaker 0: but that is still more.

765
00:52:36,913 --> 00:52:44,160
Speaker 1: I think they thought when they made this movie I think there was like an interview with them at the end, but they didn't say too much but what it did come across like.

766
00:52:45,003 --> 00:52:47,633
Speaker 1: We decided we wanted to make a studio trigger movie

767
00:52:47,994 --> 00:52:48,597
Speaker 0: about fire

768
00:52:48,617 --> 00:52:51,185
Speaker 1: about fire And then they pretty much has made

769
00:52:51,265 --> 00:52:51,947
Speaker 0: up a plot

770
00:52:52,388 --> 00:53:01,200
Speaker 1: in order to support the scenes that they wanted including like I said Robot so big it punches the earth that is entirely on fire and solar system

771
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:04,776
Speaker 0: Because they were like with kill la kill.

772
00:53:04,816 --> 00:53:10,746
Speaker 0: We wanted to make a movie about clothes Yeah, and then they even correct the show about clothes Yeah, but what then they correct themselves like.

773
00:53:10,766 --> 00:53:22,160
Speaker 0: well actually about fabric, yeah specifically fabric Yeah, so this is the fire movie Yeah, and it's great and you should go see it and we truly live in a golden age of animation.
