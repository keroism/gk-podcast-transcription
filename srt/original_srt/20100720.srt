1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,643
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, July 20th.

2
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:11,045
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:12,549
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:14,537
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:18,150
Speaker 0: Tonight, the Chicago Express rolls through the ages.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,288
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:34,500
Speaker 1: Today, I have eliminated the Ode to Hobo that was permeating the front bathroom of our apartment.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,039
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,768
Speaker 0: I don't know.

10
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:38,879
Speaker 0: I don't think you did.

11
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:44,280
Speaker 1: Not the Ode to Hobo, but I think from now on there's a word for the smell of a hobo.

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,837
Speaker 1: And I think it is hobo.

13
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:51,300
Speaker 0: Well, you have not eliminated it because it is all over.

14
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:55,219
Speaker 1: Yes, all over in the sealed studio room with the air conditioning on.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,800
Speaker 1: Cut off both circulatory and physically from the other room.

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,579
Speaker 0: Well, it's not cut off from you, which was in this room.

17
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:04,078
Speaker 0: And that emanated from you.

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,396
Speaker 0: You see, your implication is that the hobo was coming from Rem.

19
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:10,565
Speaker 0: It's funny.

20
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,980
Speaker 1: Up until I moved to New York, right?

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,879
Speaker 1: The word hobo meant what it's supposed to mean.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,860
Speaker 1: Hobo was a train.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,060
Speaker 1: You know, there's like the transient who works versus the transient who doesn't versus the stationary person.

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,100
Speaker 0: Yes, they're bums, hobos, vagrants, drifters, like tramps.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,118
Speaker 0: They're all different.

26
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,879
Speaker 0: It means very specific things.

27
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:35,079
Speaker 0: If you're just sitting around drunk, not doing shit, that's a bum.

28
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:42,780
Speaker 0: But if you're like traveling around, actually doing stuff sometimes, tramp, hobo, maybe or tramp, it depends.

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,479
Speaker 1: I think tramps travel and don't work.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,660
Speaker 1: Hobos travel to work.

31
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,219
Speaker 0: If you're a homeless guy running a pirate radio station in the woods, that's a hobo.

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,719
Speaker 1: Now, I think it's the tramps are the ones who travel around and work and hobos travel around and don't work.

33
00:01:55,102 --> 00:01:55,798
Speaker 0: I don't know.

34
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:04,900
Speaker 1: Regardless, now that I live in the city, it seems like everyone just says hobo to refer to specifically someone with the hobo probably on the subway.

35
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:08,378
Speaker 1: In that empty car.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,419
Speaker 0: So, okay, is that all you got?

37
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,059
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

38
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:12,859
Speaker 1: I eliminated the hobo.

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,878
Speaker 0: I'm riding my bike over the bridge just now.

40
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:16,197
Speaker 0: Ten minutes ago.

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,760
Speaker 0: Or maybe even 15.

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,400
Speaker 0: And I'm going up, up towards Queens.

43
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:24,620
Speaker 0: And there's a guy coming down, down towards Manhattan.

44
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,120
Speaker 0: And he's, right?

45
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:32,440
Speaker 0: So he's a kind of large guy, but he's riding a bike, all good.

46
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:33,599
Speaker 0: He's got no problems.

47
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:40,460
Speaker 0: And he's got this grimace on his face and it looks just like E Honda.

48
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,460
Speaker 0: Like, Oh my God, it's E Honda riding a bike.

49
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:50,840
Speaker 0: And then he brings his head down to sort of get low to get speed going in the downhill.

50
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:52,399
Speaker 0: And it was a Honda headbutt.

51
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:53,779
Speaker 0: It was, it was just epic.

52
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:56,339
Speaker 0: It was epic Honda headbutt coming down the hill.

53
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:56,745
Speaker 1: Wow.

54
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:57,651
Speaker 0: That's it.

55
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:58,759
Speaker 1: Not bad.

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,049
Speaker 0: Yeah.

57
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,031
Speaker 0: It was kind of like, Whoa.

58
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:01,218
Speaker 0: E Honda.

59
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:01,838
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

60
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,119
Speaker 0: He's coming down the bike.

61
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:08,160
Speaker 1: I have very little trouble with E Honda, to be honest.

62
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,959
Speaker 1: He's probably, I can just kind of poke him out of the way.

63
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:10,879
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no.

64
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:11,539
Speaker 0: You got to watch out.

65
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,208
Speaker 0: There's some guys.

66
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:13,060
Speaker 0: they're good with E Honda.

67
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,259
Speaker 0: They'll just sit on you.

68
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,240
Speaker 0: And then as soon as you get up, they'll sit on you again.

69
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:19,459
Speaker 0: And they'll sit on you again.

70
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,119
Speaker 1: You were staying back.

71
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,560
Speaker 0: They just sit on you over and over again.

72
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,739
Speaker 0: And you can't do anything about it unless you're good.

73
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:29,340
Speaker 1: So probably the most important gaming, anything we could talk about.

74
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,739
Speaker 0: And as to the, how many, how many shows are we going to do on NS2?

75
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,503
Speaker 0: You think it's.

76
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:37,020
Speaker 1: how many strips did penny arcade do on tribes?

77
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:37,419
Speaker 0: All right.

78
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,659
Speaker 0: We'll count and we'll do the same number of tribes too.

79
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,059
Speaker 1: We can get away with that many.

80
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:41,560
Speaker 0: All right.

81
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,219
Speaker 0: So we'll count.

82
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:43,297
Speaker 0: And that's the number we will do.

83
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:48,500
Speaker 1: But regardless, the alpha of NS2 is coming out in six.

84
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,333
Speaker 0: So we're going to do an episode in the alpha and the data and the final release.

85
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:57,100
Speaker 0: And maybe talk more about exploits of playing the actual release.

86
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,508
Speaker 0: So maybe a show.

87
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,580
Speaker 0: when the final release sucks, we don't play it anymore.

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:10,680
Speaker 1: It's very sad that we're not going to Otacon, but I realized it's probably for the best because that is the first weekend after the NS2 alpha is in my hands.

89
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,299
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

90
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,460
Speaker 1: What else am I going to be doing that weekend?

91
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Speaker 1: What else am I going to be doing that week?

92
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,600
Speaker 1: I should just take work off, take a week off.

93
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:20,560
Speaker 0: But the thing is, we almost made that mistake with team four.

94
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,539
Speaker 1: If I had taken, if I'd taken the day off for team fortress, I might've just gone into work for a half day.

95
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:27,320
Speaker 0: Yeah.

96
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,200
Speaker 0: So, uh, the, I'm not making that mistake.

97
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,780
Speaker 0: It's a, you know, it's great, but it's a video game.

98
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:33,735
Speaker 0: It's not going anywhere.

99
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:37,339
Speaker 1: Well, tribes who went somewhere, every second counted.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,548
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

101
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:40,400
Speaker 0: every second counted?

102
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,220
Speaker 1: Every second of playing tribes counted.

103
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,878
Speaker 0: Oh, tribes.

104
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,220
Speaker 0: You said that is team fortress.

105
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,620
Speaker 1: Oh, every second of team fortress counted just for something very different.

106
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:47,871
Speaker 1: Yeah.

107
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:49,536
Speaker 0: All right.

108
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,200
Speaker 1: Uh, I got some news, nothing to talk about.

109
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:53,458
Speaker 0: Oh, news.

110
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,177
Speaker 0: Oh, well there's that.

111
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:59,099
Speaker 0: Uh, I guess my news is the alien swarm game that's coming out, which I keep getting, I guess it's out.

112
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,020
Speaker 0: It's not coming out.

113
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,479
Speaker 0: It is out.

114
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:04,400
Speaker 0: And I keep getting confused because this is old Genesis game called alien storm.

115
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:09,680
Speaker 0: And there's another game on the Xbox and PC called the alien breed.

116
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:10,539
Speaker 0: Right.

117
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:11,660
Speaker 0: So is it's confusing.

118
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:19,580
Speaker 0: But, um, what this game is, it's a four player co-op shmup, uh, not shmup, uh, robotron shooter.

119
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:19,944
Speaker 0: Right.

120
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,660
Speaker 0: And I've been looking for a game like that for a long time.

121
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,320
Speaker 0: I actually remember we were at gaming for hope a long time ago, and some guys were playing a game that looked just like that.

122
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,460
Speaker 0: It looked like a row, an eight of, you know, a Marines versus aliens co-op robotron shooter.

123
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:35,479
Speaker 1: What was that game?

124
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,231
Speaker 0: I can't for life and we find what game that was.

125
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:41,900
Speaker 1: no matter how hard I try, because I didn't even, I was trying to look at the guy's monitor.

126
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,020
Speaker 1: Cause I was thinking about buying it.

127
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,180
Speaker 1: I barely even looked at the game.

128
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,279
Speaker 1: I was like, Oh, that looks cool.

129
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,679
Speaker 0: I couldn't even figure out what game it was.

130
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:54,820
Speaker 0: And if anyone knows of a game that is just like alien swarm, but not, and is perhaps older, a few years older for the PC, let me know.

131
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,477
Speaker 0: Cause I want it.

132
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,189
Speaker 0: But, uh, alien swarm is a it's.

133
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,100
Speaker 0: it's on the source engine and it's a free, absolutely free co-op robotron shooter.

134
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:07,679
Speaker 0: And I haven't played it yet because when I tried to download it last night, steam servers are all busy.

135
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:08,498
Speaker 0: Okay.

136
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,043
Speaker 0: Steam.

137
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:11,640
Speaker 0: look, this has happened like a bunch of times.

138
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,199
Speaker 0: Every time a new popular game comes out, the servers are busy.

139
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:15,899
Speaker 0: You got to have enough servers.

140
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:16,620
Speaker 0: All right.

141
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,120
Speaker 0: This is the reason steam originally came out was because when we tried to get an update to counter-strike, we couldn't.

142
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:22,766
Speaker 1: I remember those days.

143
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:26,179
Speaker 1: I'd come home from school and you're sitting there like, you know, I'd come up from class.

144
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,400
Speaker 1: You're not playing counter-strike.

145
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,040
Speaker 1: I'm like, Scott, why aren't you playing counter-strike?

146
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,419
Speaker 0: You'd be like, I got to get the new update.

147
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,434
Speaker 0: I can't play without it.

148
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:33,910
Speaker 1: And then fuck.

149
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,959
Speaker 1: now I got to get the update.

150
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:35,699
Speaker 0: Yup.

151
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:37,379
Speaker 1: I don't miss those days at all.

152
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:44,500
Speaker 1: I think what they could do, they could solve the problem, but now they unsolved the problem because, uh, steam could fake it.

153
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,040
Speaker 1: All they would have to do is stagger the releases a little bit.

154
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,039
Speaker 1: So say a game's going to come out.

155
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,260
Speaker 1: Don't say a time.

156
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,359
Speaker 1: Just say a day and pick regions.

157
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:56,060
Speaker 1: And for each region, be like, ah, let people start downloading here.

158
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,775
Speaker 1: Now they don't even have to do that.

159
00:06:58,482 --> 00:06:59,540
Speaker 0: All they have to do is right.

160
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,179
Speaker 0: I click on download, right?

161
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,920
Speaker 0: Which means I want to download this game.

162
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:03,679
Speaker 0: And what does it say?

163
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:05,259
Speaker 0: It says, sorry, the servers are busy.

164
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:06,958
Speaker 0: Why do you tell me that?

165
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:13,058
Speaker 1: I mean, let's say they don't want to just have it downloaded whenever it can later checking on its own.

166
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,640
Speaker 0: Like it's a no brainer guys.

167
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,580
Speaker 1: So, so, so, so I mean, Scott's got a question.

168
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:23,380
Speaker 1: Will they make more less or the same amount of money?

169
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:30,615
Speaker 0: If they implement this game, they're going to make no different money, uh, because this game is free.

170
00:07:31,382 --> 00:07:34,840
Speaker 0: Well then, but this game is trying to convince people.

171
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:44,720
Speaker 0: The thing about this game is it is free, but it actually comes with a lot of updates to the source engine, including the ability to make a non first person game on the source engine, uh, among other things, right?

172
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:52,500
Speaker 0: So there is actually trying to really encourage people to mod the hell up and to make new games on the source engine and this kind of variety.

173
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,439
Speaker 0: And that's why they've made this free game here.

174
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,880
Speaker 0: So it's, you know, I've heard a lot of complaints about the game and I mean, how much can you really complain?

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,640
Speaker 0: It's free about shitty controls and such and such.

176
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:02,920
Speaker 0: And they're probably true.

177
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:03,300
Speaker 0: I don't know.

178
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,380
Speaker 0: I haven't played it, but, uh, hopefully there'll be some awesome mods and shit for awesomeness.

179
00:08:08,962 --> 00:08:11,000
Speaker 0: And I look forward to the possibilities.

180
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:23,667
Speaker 1: So also, uh, yesterday, you know, the reason we're doing kind of a messed up schedule is Scott noticed on Kotaku and we went to a lecture or a panel really about what games are going to be like in the year 20, whether

181
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:27,237
Speaker 0: we paid 10 bucks to go to a panel, one panel, one panel.

182
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,520
Speaker 1: That's why things like, oh, it was actually X or such a deal.

183
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,078
Speaker 1: I mean, packs, I, well, I don't pay, but you pay what, 60 bucks and you get three days worth of this stuff.

184
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:35,674
Speaker 0: Yeah.

185
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,900
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, the panel was, it was okay, but it felt a little short.

186
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:46,800
Speaker 1: Well, I think the problem was that they had really good panelists like Eric Zimmerman and Ben Fetter and these other people, and they didn't stay on topic for shit.

187
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,380
Speaker 1: No, they talked about the future of gaming for like five minutes.

188
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,020
Speaker 0: So the deal was that it was actually two groups coming together for this, right?

189
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:04,159
Speaker 0: So you had, um, this thing called the Y plus 30 and what Y plus 30 does is they get together and they have panels and the panels are always about what is X going to be like in 30 years.

190
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,046
Speaker 0: So it'll always be like, what is going to, what is, what will your mom be like in 30 years?

191
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,856
Speaker 0: What is transportation going to be like in 30 years?

192
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,180
Speaker 0: What are telecommunications going to be like in 30 years?

193
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,397
Speaker 0: What are, uh, you know, what are paintings going to be like in 30 years?

194
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,015
Speaker 0: What are, you know, anything, clothing, fashion, any, anything that you can think of, what will it be like in 30 years?

195
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,900
Speaker 0: It's a cool idea.

196
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:30,060
Speaker 1: They, they kind of make a point that most kind of economic models and economic forecasts that businesses use forecast out at most five years.

197
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:30,599
Speaker 1: Yeah.

198
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,759
Speaker 1: They don't even look beyond that.

199
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:32,960
Speaker 0: No, cause there's no way to know.

200
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:39,900
Speaker 0: So, uh, and the other group was the New York city gaming meetup, you know, meetup.com, New York city gaming meetup, I guess.

201
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,700
Speaker 0: And they combined to do future of gaming 30 years out.

202
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:54,216
Speaker 0: And the three people on the panel were Steven to Tillo who used to be from MTV, but now he's from Kotaku, uh, Zerman, who is the head of game lab and, uh, this, he knew what was up.

203
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:55,199
Speaker 1: I liked his answer.

204
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:55,976
Speaker 0: He's one of those.

205
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,339
Speaker 0: He was like, he's one of the like big personality guys.

206
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:06,120
Speaker 0: Uh, and then there's, um, the CEO of take two interactive, which is a, uh, awesome game publisher.

207
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,160
Speaker 0: They publish civilization.

208
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:07,951
Speaker 0: Huh?

209
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:08,310
Speaker 0: Yeah.

210
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,400
Speaker 0: They're kind of important.

211
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:09,820
Speaker 0: All right.

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,100
Speaker 0: And, uh, you know, there was also the, uh, the moderator guy, what was his name?

213
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,579
Speaker 0: I forget.

214
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,160
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

215
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,960
Speaker 1: I get all my notes.

216
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,640
Speaker 0: Sorry, moderator guy.

217
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:19,140
Speaker 1: But it was a good panel.

218
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,539
Speaker 1: It was fun.

219
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:28,477
Speaker 1: The only thing aside from them not staying on topic, I don't think anyone knows how to take questions from the audience because they opened it up to questions and it's the fan boy.

220
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:33,859
Speaker 1: How do I get into the industry question, which is really, please notice me and get me into the industry.

221
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:36,238
Speaker 0: What does that have to do with what gaming is going to be like in 30 years?

222
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,180
Speaker 1: And the guy tried to later frame.

223
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,840
Speaker 1: He's like, yeah, so what should I be doing?

224
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,740
Speaker 1: You know, keeping in mind the industry 30 years from now.

225
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever dude.

226
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:44,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

227
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,999
Speaker 1: And the other guy's question was basically me, me, blah, blah, blah, me, me, me, point, point, point, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

228
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:50,819
Speaker 1: No question.

229
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,779
Speaker 1: No question came out of that guy.

230
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,290
Speaker 0: Yeah.

231
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:55,160
Speaker 0: My, I have a new idea, right?

232
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,859
Speaker 1: Whenever we take questions, which you don't do that often at best, we'll lie and say, we're going to take questions and then we, Oh, we're out of time.

233
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:03,379
Speaker 1: And then we kick everyone out of the room.

234
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,920
Speaker 0: What we're going to do is we're going to have Scott's rules of question asking.

235
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,780
Speaker 0: And if someone breaks a rule of Scott's rule of question asking, I'm just going to point the finger and make them walk away.

236
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:13,340
Speaker 1: And they're done.

237
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,359
Speaker 1: I think this'll work.

238
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,660
Speaker 0: I'm just going to wave them off.

239
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,031
Speaker 1: Be like, because we've won the woo game.

240
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:25,000
Speaker 1: now, bit by bit, every time we do panels at like anime cons, we do our little like two minute shtick and it stops the woo game.

241
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:30,173
Speaker 1: So clearly we can do a little meta shtick to stop whatever BS we don't want to deal with.

242
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:36,020
Speaker 0: Before, before we take any questions, I'm going to put up on the screen, Scott's rules of asking questions and the rules are as follows.

243
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,860
Speaker 0: Number one, your question will be on topic.

244
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,600
Speaker 0: Number two, your question will be, well, number one, your question will be a question.

245
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,140
Speaker 1: I think the easy way around that you get one sentence.

246
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:45,778
Speaker 1: It must end in a question mark.

247
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:46,475
Speaker 0: Yes.

248
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,299
Speaker 1: Uh, semi-colons are okay, I guess.

249
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:49,791
Speaker 0: Yeah.

250
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:54,840
Speaker 0: But I mean, you know, the idea is that you will ask a question, you will not have a whole bunch of sentences around the question.

251
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,600
Speaker 0: Your question will be on topic.

252
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:59,479
Speaker 0: You know, your question will not be specific to you.

253
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:02,980
Speaker 0: It will be, you know, it was about the topic in general.

254
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,494
Speaker 0: It cannot be anything about you, right?

255
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:06,098
Speaker 0: Not allowed.

256
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:09,459
Speaker 0: And I guess I might come up with a couple other rules to throw in there.

257
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:12,100
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's, we're going to have those kinds of rules.

258
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,280
Speaker 0: And if you break any of those rules, we're just not going to address you.

259
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:14,878
Speaker 0: Just sit down.

260
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:15,918
Speaker 0: You broke the rules.

261
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:16,500
Speaker 1: Of course.

262
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,840
Speaker 1: Rather than even doing that, we can just have the moderator who has the microphone goes up to people.

263
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,739
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you're a fan.

264
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:28,020
Speaker 0: The moderator will use Scott's rules of question as to judge whether or not the question will be permitted.

265
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:30,460
Speaker 1: The key is we got to point out what we're doing.

266
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:37,279
Speaker 1: And then when the Q and a is awesome, as opposed to the usual Q and a that sucks at everything, maybe other people start doing the same thing.

267
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:43,840
Speaker 0: The thing is, I don't want to intimidate people away from attempting to ask the question because someone actually has a legitimately good question.

268
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,759
Speaker 0: They got to ask that shit.

269
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:44,971
Speaker 1: Yup.

270
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,180
Speaker 1: Like for example, is kids can Cosmo your favorite character?

271
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,185
Speaker 0: That's an excellent question,

272
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,814
Speaker 1: but I mean, the other

273
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:53,737
Speaker 0: character, the grandma,

274
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:03,484
Speaker 1: I really would like to hear what every one of these people had to say about the topic independent of what they all had to say because they kept talking about like Zinga and getting all over the place and

275
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:07,060
Speaker 0: they kept talking about now and not 30.

276
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,980
Speaker 0: I don't think there was maybe two things they talked about that actually maybe discussed what gaming would be like 30 years in the future.

277
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:14,519
Speaker 1: Yeah.

278
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,560
Speaker 1: No one asked about like procedural content generation or where the fuck did VR go?

279
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,579
Speaker 0: These guys, these guys, CEOs and stuff, they don't even know stuff we know.

280
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,460
Speaker 0: It's like we know stuff they don't know.

281
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,440
Speaker 1: Except the game lab guy.

282
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,680
Speaker 1: He seemed to know the most, he knows the most, but he didn't.

283
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,679
Speaker 0: He still didn't know.

284
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,460
Speaker 1: Like they were talking about the industry and like who plays games and who doesn't.

285
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,040
Speaker 1: And I don't think anyone up there realized that the Sega Genesis is so crazily popular in South America.

286
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,476
Speaker 0: Yeah.

287
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,418
Speaker 0: I mean, they were like, yeah, I guess, you know, who plays console games elsewhere in the world?

288
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,920
Speaker 0: I'm like, dude, people are playing games everywhere in the world.

289
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Speaker 0: They're just not playing.

290
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,220
Speaker 0: They mind to be playing PlayStation three and export like in China.

291
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,700
Speaker 1: The opposite.

292
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,640
Speaker 1: There's playing PC games.

293
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,078
Speaker 1: They knew that.

294
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,100
Speaker 1: They knew about China, but they didn't know about South America.

295
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,980
Speaker 0: They know about China because changing monies in China.

296
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:54,600
Speaker 0: All right.

297
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Speaker 0: You know, just had the CEO guy.

298
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,460
Speaker 0: He was all business.

299
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,254
Speaker 0: He was like, you know, there are more gamers in China than there are people in the US.

300
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:07,020
Speaker 1: One guy asked a kind of lame question about if money were no object and there were no constraints of technology or anything, what kind of game would you make?

301
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,440
Speaker 0: He's like, I wouldn't make a game because there'd be no money in it.

302
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:16,740
Speaker 1: People all had their answers and he basically, he shut the guy down by saying what Scott just said and then saying, and without constraints, like it's not even really a question.

303
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,893
Speaker 1: There's no way to answer that.

304
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:18,904
Speaker 0: Hmm.

305
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:19,759
Speaker 1: Oh, I will.

306
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,840
Speaker 0: He was, it was definitely a cool guy because like he was a CEO of a big company.

307
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:23,947
Speaker 0: Right.

308
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:25,100
Speaker 0: And he definitely acted.

309
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,600
Speaker 0: He was all business, but he didn't, he had like a, you know, a normal dude personality.

310
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:30,798
Speaker 0: He was like, Hey, what's going on?

311
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,477
Speaker 0: What's up?

312
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:34,760
Speaker 0: You know, he was laughing and having a good time and you know, chillin.

313
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,538
Speaker 0: He didn't have a lot.

314
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,860
Speaker 0: It didn't seem like he had the real strong gaming knowledge, even though he's a CEO.

315
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:46,119
Speaker 1: If the questions had been better, I would have loved to hear his perspective on the economics of gaming 30 years from now.

316
00:14:46,260 --> 00:15:07,180
Speaker 0: But at the same time, I think that, you know, while that guy is a good guy, you could tell, but you could also tell that that's that kind of a CEO is the reason that we have a lot, so much trouble just in general with companies these days is that the guys running companies don't actually, there are not actually passionate about the thing the company does, right?

317
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,260
Speaker 0: This is why Apple can kick everyone's ass despite being jerks.

318
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:17,399
Speaker 0: Cause Steve jobs, but I can knows and cares about computers and that's why he can go and say, is computer shit, fix this, fix this, fix this.

319
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,799
Speaker 0: And you know, this take two guy, if they show him five, he's not going to go up and say, no, the hexes aren't going to work.

320
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:24,818
Speaker 0: He doesn't know.

321
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,059
Speaker 0: He just says, Oh, okay, go, go nuts.

322
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:31,180
Speaker 0: You know, you need, you know, Sid Meyer should be the CEO of take two.

323
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,580
Speaker 0: Then you'd have right.

324
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,439
Speaker 0: Such quality.

325
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,280
Speaker 0: It would be unbelievable.

326
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:42,880
Speaker 1: The one interesting point that was raised was the idea that once video games become like generic, like they are ubiquitous, they're just part of culture.

327
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,240
Speaker 1: There's going to be a generation that rebels against video games, just like they rebel against everything else.

328
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,762
Speaker 1: At some point,

329
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,805
Speaker 0: that was the one thing, the one really interesting thing that someone said that was, uh,

330
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:53,628
Speaker 1: I can imagine

331
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:54,914
Speaker 0: a kid, like imagine,

332
00:15:54,934 --> 00:16:01,439
Speaker 1: you know, right now it's like parents will say things like, all right, at least little Johnny is playing video games instead of getting into crack.

333
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,660
Speaker 1: Maybe video games will get him interested in history.

334
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:14,340
Speaker 1: Imagine 30 years from now, there's a time where parents are saying, well, at least he's only doing X, but hopefully that'll get him interested in video games.

335
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,619
Speaker 1: We really want him to be playing video games.

336
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:24,820
Speaker 0: See, here's the thing though with that is I think that that argument is actually wrong because what they're doing there is, you know, they compare it to rock and roll, right?

337
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:29,140
Speaker 0: And the thing is rock and roll is a genre, but video games are a medium, right?

338
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,740
Speaker 0: It's not going to be a question of, we need to get them into video games.

339
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,820
Speaker 0: It's going to be like, if only he would play FPSs, right?

340
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,018
Speaker 0: He's not playing FPSs.

341
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,140
Speaker 0: He's playing these trash genre of games.

342
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,640
Speaker 0: You know, kids these days, they might not like rock and roll.

343
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,699
Speaker 0: They still like music.

344
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:50,480
Speaker 0: You know, even the old people who complained about rock and roll liked music that everyone likes movies, but the old people like the old black and white movies, you know, and the new punk kids.

345
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,179
Speaker 1: I would argue that M Night Shyamalan does not in fact like movies and is doing everything in his power to destroy them.

346
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:02,100
Speaker 0: I'm just saying in general, right, is that it's not going to be an issue of, you know, no one's going to rebel against video games.

347
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,680
Speaker 0: They might just rebel against particular genres of video games in favor of other genres.

348
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,760
Speaker 0: And we're going to say that kind of video game you're playing is shit.

349
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,179
Speaker 0: You should be playing Pac-Man.

350
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,134
Speaker 0: And they go, fuck Pac-Man, I'm going to play Farmville 10, you know, or, uh, dude, bro three.

351
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:28,818
Speaker 1: The other cool point along these lines was that gaming, like the stuff we do that makes us kind of literate at gaming is going to be just a basic component of societal literacy in the future.

352
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:35,839
Speaker 1: That, I mean, think about the language we have about discussing game mechanics or games or even non games, but in the context of games.

353
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:44,661
Speaker 1: And, uh, the point was made that, you know, reading, and we make this point all the time, so maybe that's why I remember it so much that literacy doesn't just mean reading and writing.

354
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:52,838
Speaker 1: because if you can read and write and you're not computer literate, you're already at such a disadvantage that it won't be long until you're basically not even considered society literate.

355
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,031
Speaker 1: Yeah.

356
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,020
Speaker 0: This, this all kinds of different literacy.

357
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:55,172
Speaker 0: Right.

358
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,940
Speaker 0: And he talked about, which I didn't even think about before, like video game literacy, like you pick up a controller and you turn on Mario and you don't know what to do.

359
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,757
Speaker 0: You're not video game literate.

360
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:07,860
Speaker 0: You just, you don't know, you know, what buttons to push.

361
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,938
Speaker 0: You can't just, you know, control the buttons and push them without having to consciously think about them.

362
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,940
Speaker 0: You're, you're lacking illiteracy there.

363
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,780
Speaker 0: You know, I look at, you know, a Zelda game and you see an eyeball on the wall.

364
00:18:19,102 --> 00:18:20,419
Speaker 0: You know, you got to shoot that shit.

365
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,380
Speaker 0: Some people don't have that natural instinct that they see the eyeball up there and they know that that's for shooting.

366
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,660
Speaker 0: They don't, they're not literate in that kind of thing.

367
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,378
Speaker 0: You know, someone sees six stats, strength decks, int, wiz, con, and they have no idea what they mean.

368
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,660
Speaker 0: They're not literate in the RPG stat kind of game.

369
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,619
Speaker 0: They don't, they don't get it.

370
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,938
Speaker 0: They need an, you know, they need to become, you know, the learn that shit.

371
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,999
Speaker 1: But one point that Eric Zimmerman made my last point I want to bring up because I thought it was cool.

372
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,980
Speaker 1: One guy did ask about board games and he's like, you guys are talking like video games in the only future.

373
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,900
Speaker 0: His question was a good question, but he asked it in a really bad way.

374
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,180
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

375
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,267
Speaker 1: Yeah.

376
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,558
Speaker 1: I just wanted him to shut up.

377
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,400
Speaker 0: He should've just said, what about tabletop gaming?

378
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,080
Speaker 0: Because I know the Zimmerman guy, we actually met him once before for like 30 seconds because we went to a board game night at his company.

379
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,878
Speaker 1: He knows what's up.

380
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,640
Speaker 1: And he, he expressed this again, like, yeah, board games are great and Euro games.

381
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:11,340
Speaker 1: And he said all the key words that make me know that he knows what's up.

382
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,873
Speaker 0: He knows what's up.

383
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,340
Speaker 1: And he had an interesting answer, but I wish they would've discussed that more.

384
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,679
Speaker 0: And I wish his were board game guys.

385
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,860
Speaker 1: Of course you want to discuss games more, more like it, like where that's going to go.

386
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:26,098
Speaker 1: And also they would have had more time if they just shut the guy up after he asked his question.

387
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:26,655
Speaker 0: Yes.

388
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,500
Speaker 0: I mean, his question could have just been some, he could have just said, what about tabletop gaming?

389
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,899
Speaker 0: That's all he had to say.

390
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,280
Speaker 0: But he went on for like two minutes, blah, blah, blah.

391
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,717
Speaker 0: You know, I grew up the dice and it's like, we don't care about.

392
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,180
Speaker 0: you just say, what about tabletop games?

393
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,171
Speaker 0: It's all you guys say.

394
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:41,556
Speaker 0: and shut up.

395
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:58,679
Speaker 1: So things of the day, uh, I, I kinda want to talk about NS2 again, but I'm going to not talk about it until I've played it.

396
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:07,446
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day is a little museum of 12 pictures, a slideshow of famous or interesting shivs.

397
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:18,820
Speaker 0: I want to make sure this isn't a duplicate of an extremely multiple year old thing of the day where we had a gallery of shivs collected from prison that were showing the ingenuity of the prisoners.

398
00:20:19,362 --> 00:20:22,500
Speaker 0: They were all the different shivs they were able to make out of different things.

399
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,800
Speaker 1: This is actually different because that was, you know, prisoner ingenuity and had all these non shiv items as well.

400
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:37,436
Speaker 1: This is just shivs and it's on this kind of design blog talking about looking at like the actual design of the shiv, like from a design perspective, it needs to be easy to hide.

401
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,360
Speaker 0: It needs to be cheap to construct.

402
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:39,920
Speaker 1: Easy to make.

403
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:46,940
Speaker 0: What's cool is a lot of these to be actually, it needs to actually be pointy and dangerous and maybe even deconstructable so that it no longer is a shiv.

404
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,479
Speaker 1: One guy made a glove that has another glove over it.

405
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,198
Speaker 1: And if you basically it's Wolverine claws hidden inside of it.

406
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,188
Speaker 0: Whoa.

407
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:54,620
Speaker 1: There were carpet tacks.

408
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,753
Speaker 1: One guy took a typewriter and turned the pole down the middle into a shiv one.

409
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:06,039
Speaker 1: It looks like a club someone medieval would make, but instead of like nubs, like a wooden, like a wooden club with spikes.

410
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:06,443
Speaker 1: Yes.

411
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:08,520
Speaker 1: But the spikes are basically the nail in it.

412
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:16,818
Speaker 1: He saved the safety razor blades that they could buy from like the commissary and he put them in and made this dangerous looking motherfucker.

413
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:19,287
Speaker 0: Wait.

414
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:20,840
Speaker 0: So safety razor blades.

415
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:23,059
Speaker 0: But don't they make you like shave with them and give them back?

416
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:23,705
Speaker 1: I don't know.

417
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:25,139
Speaker 1: Apparently you could just buy them.

418
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,779
Speaker 1: So people made shivs out of them.

419
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:28,200
Speaker 0: I don't think they do that anymore.

420
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:31,700
Speaker 0: I assume the prison barber shave you if you want to shave.

421
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,243
Speaker 1: I don't know.

422
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:35,040
Speaker 0: The thing is, if I was in prison, I would grow a beard.

423
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,597
Speaker 0: You know why?

424
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,118
Speaker 0: Hide my shiv in there.

425
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:44,779
Speaker 1: So I thought this was cool and it wasn't just a college humor video for once.

426
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,000
Speaker 0: Mine is a YouTube video, even though it's posted on Boing Boing.

427
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,760
Speaker 0: And the thing is, I do quite a few things of the day from Boing Boing.

428
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,419
Speaker 0: It seems like no one actually reads Boing Boing.

429
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,404
Speaker 0: I don't get it anyway.

430
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,427
Speaker 0: Or at least no one says anything that, hey, I saw your thing today on Boing Boing.

431
00:21:58,488 --> 00:21:59,699
Speaker 0: Why do you keep picking stuff from there?

432
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:03,539
Speaker 1: No one says anything about my college humor picking except you.

433
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:09,064
Speaker 0: Well, because your college humor picking is much more prevalent than my Boing Boing picking.

434
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:10,600
Speaker 1: But no one points out no one's like rim.

435
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,940
Speaker 1: You just steal from college humor.

436
00:22:12,804 --> 00:22:14,280
Speaker 0: I guess no one reads any of the Internet.

437
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:18,940
Speaker 0: Except they guess they check out geek nice things of the day.

438
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,460
Speaker 0: So what this is, is Raytheon.

439
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,120
Speaker 0: Apparently solid state lasers.

440
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,402
Speaker 0: Right.

441
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:25,480
Speaker 0: There's multiple kinds of lasers.

442
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,460
Speaker 0: Solid state is a good kind and solid state lasers weren't really powerful enough for any sort of military use.

443
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:32,894
Speaker 0: But now they are.

444
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:36,833
Speaker 0: Raytheon has a 50 kilowatt, that's a lot.

445
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:38,340
Speaker 0: solid state laser.

446
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:44,840
Speaker 0: And they sent up an unmanned flying drone and they shot their laser at it.

447
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:45,445
Speaker 0: Pew, pew, pew.

448
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:46,739
Speaker 0: And it totally worked.

449
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:48,719
Speaker 0: And it exploded and crashed.

450
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:50,419
Speaker 0: And here's a video of it.

451
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,371
Speaker 0: It's it's black and white because infrared.

452
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:53,779
Speaker 0: that way you can see what's going on.

453
00:22:54,262 --> 00:22:57,020
Speaker 0: And it was probably done at night, you know, because they like keep shit secret.

454
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,100
Speaker 0: And they probably also in the middle of nowhere where the plane could crash into the ground without killing anybody.

455
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:09,272
Speaker 0: So and, you know, it's the cool thing about this is basically of infinite ammo, as long as you have electricity.

456
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:09,780
Speaker 0: Right.

457
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,260
Speaker 1: Well, Electron, I mean, it's still ammo.

458
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,539
Speaker 1: You've got a really good supply.

459
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's you know, it's not.

460
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,120
Speaker 0: it's not truly unlimited ammo.

461
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,440
Speaker 0: It's effectively unlimited ammo.

462
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,160
Speaker 0: So check out this video.

463
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:23,299
Speaker 0: We're going to have lasers soon.

464
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:31,540
Speaker 0: And, you know, that's that's telling because I've been I just finished watching Space Battleship Yamato, the second television series in which there were space lasers.

465
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,320
Speaker 0: You're getting ahead of me on long, old and I'm almost out of lazy Matsumoto.

466
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,680
Speaker 0: I mean, what else am I going to watch?

467
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,599
Speaker 0: I've watched Harlock, the 70s show.

468
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:41,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I watched Galaxy Express.

469
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:43,760
Speaker 0: I watched almost all the Yamato.

470
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,500
Speaker 0: I've got to watch three, three or four Yamato movies.

471
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,820
Speaker 1: You realize the next step is Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

472
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,320
Speaker 1: No, that's the next step.

473
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,145
Speaker 1: You're going to watch it.

474
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:54,280
Speaker 0: It's going to happen by lazy Matsumoto.

475
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,627
Speaker 1: It is going to happen.

476
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,238
Speaker 1: You're going to watch it.

477
00:23:57,902 --> 00:24:00,659
Speaker 0: Maybe when I'm an old man and retired and have nothing better to do.

478
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:07,620
Speaker 1: So briefly, the meta moment, the book club, the current book club is still the Lies of Locke Lammer, which we both read.

479
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,537
Speaker 1: And we'll have a show up for it soon.

480
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:09,739
Speaker 1: ish.

481
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,959
Speaker 0: It's written by Scott Lynch.

482
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,419
Speaker 1: I haven't picked the next book yet.

483
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,680
Speaker 1: It's Lupin, the third in a fantasy world.

484
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:15,126
Speaker 1: That's it.

485
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,180
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a good call.

486
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,853
Speaker 1: That's all it is.

487
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:20,559
Speaker 0: It's got some other stuff going on, though.

488
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,404
Speaker 1: But almost not.

489
00:24:21,485 --> 00:24:23,359
Speaker 1: It's got a precursor civilization built in.

490
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:24,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?

491
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's but Lupin's.

492
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:26,980
Speaker 0: some of the Lupin's have that.

493
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,139
Speaker 0: Like remember the Lupin was the one with the secret town.

494
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,940
Speaker 1: Well, I also legend of the Babylon gold.

495
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,317
Speaker 0: That one doesn't count.

496
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:35,760
Speaker 1: Much more important.

497
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Speaker 1: And as to the alpha is coming out on July 26.

498
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,563
Speaker 0: How is that meta?

499
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,619
Speaker 1: I don't know, because I'm going to disappear for about a week.

500
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,754
Speaker 0: Did we already discuss this?

501
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:44,079
Speaker 0: Yes.

502
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:45,318
Speaker 1: OK, that was the joke.

503
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:47,113
Speaker 0: Other meta.

504
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:47,519
Speaker 1: We are.

505
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,980
Speaker 1: We've announced it already, but we're not going to be attending Otacon because as of today, they still don't have a schedule for us panelists.

506
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,531
Speaker 1: So we bailed.

507
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:53,777
Speaker 0: Yep.

508
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,840
Speaker 1: We'll be at the Penny Arcade Expo.

509
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:58,900
Speaker 0: Pax Prime Labor Day weekend in Seattle.

510
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,180
Speaker 1: Seattle will be doing egregiously unrealized potential.

511
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,260
Speaker 1: We will also be doing game mechanics and mechanism design.

512
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,620
Speaker 1: You hardcore fuckers want some hardcore panels.

513
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:10,478
Speaker 1: We got to see if you like it.

514
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,042
Speaker 0: I was there.

515
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:13,960
Speaker 0: I just I came up with that whole mechanism game design panel.

516
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,016
Speaker 0: I just came up with the whole thing.

517
00:25:15,077 --> 00:25:15,260
Speaker 0: Really?

518
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:15,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did.

519
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:16,459
Speaker 0: I'm going to do it.

520
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:20,020
Speaker 1: I figure you handle that when I started the the ActRaiser panel.

521
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:23,640
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I pretty much like it came to me and it wasn't.

522
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,319
Speaker 0: I'm not going to give it the status of vision.

523
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:26,899
Speaker 0: It was a. it was maybe a vis.

524
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,860
Speaker 1: See, I had the vision for the egregiously unrealized potential.

525
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,139
Speaker 1: And then I'm going to spoil that panel a little bit for all of you.

526
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:34,960
Speaker 1: There's this anime called Summer Wars.

527
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:37,979
Speaker 1: I'm going to show a clip from that at the panel, like halfway through.

528
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:40,180
Speaker 1: And then I'm going to be like, everyone, wasn't that awesome?

529
00:25:40,743 --> 00:25:42,419
Speaker 1: And I'm going to step back and say, all right.

530
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,959
Speaker 1: Now, imagine that mixed with the words I'm about to say, Pokemon, Pokemon, MMO.

531
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,368
Speaker 0: Why doesn't it exist?

532
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:50,579
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

533
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:52,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got this shit down.

534
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,279
Speaker 1: We're doing at least one, maybe two other events at PAX Prime that we can't talk about yet.

535
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:58,761
Speaker 0: Yep.

536
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:04,352
Speaker 0: Here's some events that I may or may not be attending in New York City for New York City people.

537
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:04,918
Speaker 0: You ready for this?

538
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:07,479
Speaker 0: On seven o'clock p.m.

539
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:10,739
Speaker 0: on August 2nd, there is a hack and tell.

540
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:12,467
Speaker 0: I don't know.

541
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:13,600
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll post a link to it.

542
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:21,774
Speaker 0: But basically, the idea is it's going to be sort of a monthly thing, maybe where tech people show up and some people just say, hey, this is what I'm working on lately.

543
00:26:21,794 --> 00:26:21,875
Speaker 0: Cool.

544
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,538
Speaker 0: And, you know, you just chill.

545
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:28,740
Speaker 0: Also, at noon from noon to five p.m.

546
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:38,020
Speaker 0: on August 7th, Saturday, there is going to be a Mozilla drum beat, which is going to be all about open web, open culture.

547
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,079
Speaker 0: You know, some of our friend John Britton is going to be there.

548
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:41,866
Speaker 0: All right.

549
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:43,240
Speaker 1: We got to do another open everything.

550
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's sort of an open everything ish kind of thing.

551
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:47,280
Speaker 0: It's a Mozilla drum beat.

552
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,719
Speaker 0: So probably hit that up, see what's going down.

553
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:51,820
Speaker 0: That's the same weekend as Gen Con, by the way.

554
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,477
Speaker 0: We're not going to Gen Con, but Gen Con is August 5th through 8th.

555
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,273
Speaker 1: But we are going the weekend of October 8th, 9th and 10th.

556
00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:03,877
Speaker 1: There is a nerd NYC board game night on the 8th.

557
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:07,119
Speaker 1: There is also the beginning of 10 10 10, which begins on the 8th.

558
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,820
Speaker 1: That whole weekend is burning wheel shenanigans in Astoria.

559
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,800
Speaker 1: It's also the New York Comic Con and the New York Anime Festival.

560
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:14,744
Speaker 0: Oh, snap.

561
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:17,419
Speaker 1: We're going to be at pretty much all of those.

562
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:22,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, the New York Anime, the Comic Con and the Anime Festival are in the same building at the same time.

563
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:27,700
Speaker 0: But buying one ticket to one show will actually give you admission to both shows.

564
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,934
Speaker 0: You don't don't be stupid and buy two tickets.

565
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:30,559
Speaker 0: All right.

566
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:34,520
Speaker 0: And the thing is, they are going to be separate shows, though.

567
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,660
Speaker 0: They're going to have their separate programming schedules and they're going to have separate exhibit hall.

568
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:42,920
Speaker 1: We're going to do like our gaming panels in the Comic Con side and our anime panels in the anime.

569
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,302
Speaker 0: Sorry.

570
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:44,959
Speaker 0: Are you confirmed on the Comic Con side?

571
00:27:45,724 --> 00:27:45,887
Speaker 0: Yeah.

572
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:46,397
Speaker 1: All right.

573
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:46,519
Speaker 1: Cool.

574
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,960
Speaker 1: At the same event, we're just a matter of, you know, how many of our panels are actually doing.

575
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,959
Speaker 1: We're probably going to do all our previous PAX panels and all our like a list anime that many.

576
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,105
Speaker 0: Yeah.

577
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:57,611
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

578
00:27:57,651 --> 00:27:58,379
Speaker 1: We're going to rock it.

579
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,250
Speaker 1: There's no reason not to.

580
00:27:59,270 --> 00:27:59,918
Speaker 1: We live right here.

581
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:06,880
Speaker 1: And this is like this might end up being the biggest con we go to outside of what PAX is going to be quite large population wise.

582
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,832
Speaker 0: I'm sort of afraid.

583
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:08,299
Speaker 0: But you know what?

584
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,320
Speaker 0: Every time we go to a convention in the Javits, right?

585
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,736
Speaker 0: The convention, you know, because the Javits sort of has these separate areas, the downstairs, the upstairs.

586
00:28:14,797 --> 00:28:14,939
Speaker 0: Right.

587
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:19,380
Speaker 0: And it seems like a large portion of the Javits is always sort of empty ish.

588
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,620
Speaker 0: Like everyone is crammed into one part and the other part is like desolate.

589
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,780
Speaker 1: It's kind of like remember way back in the day, like we went to one of the last Otakons.

590
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,799
Speaker 1: They didn't have the entire BCC.

591
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,380
Speaker 1: Imagine how weird it would be to see Otakon going on.

592
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:33,020
Speaker 1: And there's like a room where there's nothing.

593
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:39,059
Speaker 0: So it's going to be crazy because with this double con, they're going to use pretty much the whole Javits, the whole thing.

594
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:40,426
Speaker 0: And it is going to.

595
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:44,977
Speaker 0: there's going to be people crowding every area of the whole place is going to be insane.

596
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,358
Speaker 0: And the Javits sucks.

597
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Javits sucks.

598
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:51,260
Speaker 0: Sadly, that was my, you know, Carthage.

599
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:57,780
Speaker 1: I don't know if the BCC sucks, but PAX East is going to fill it eventually.

600
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was my Carthage Delendimest.

601
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,417
Speaker 0: Carthago Delendimest.

602
00:29:01,437 --> 00:29:01,538
Speaker 1: Yeah.

603
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,077
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've still got my Malum Badges.

604
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:05,459
Speaker 0: And the Javits sucks.

605
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, Malum Badges est.

606
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:10,340
Speaker 1: OK, I think that's about it.

607
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,140
Speaker 0: Let's move on to the main bit, I guess.

608
00:29:12,362 --> 00:29:14,060
Speaker 1: So we're going to talk about two more games.

609
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,968
Speaker 0: We did things of the day.

610
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:15,879
Speaker 0: We did bad moment, right?

611
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,679
Speaker 0: What are you doing here?

612
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,339
Speaker 0: I'm making sure we didn't mess up the show.

613
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,379
Speaker 1: That's why I'm the producer.

614
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:19,983
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

615
00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:20,860
Speaker 0: Yeah.

616
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,097
Speaker 0: Producing farts.

617
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,000
Speaker 1: Well, that's that's irrelevant.

618
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,639
Speaker 0: You're also producing poops.

619
00:29:29,524 --> 00:29:30,960
Speaker 1: I am producing poop, in fact.

620
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,159
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm manufacturing it.

621
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,380
Speaker 0: That is the reason that you have the title of producer.

622
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,399
Speaker 1: For later delivery.

623
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,700
Speaker 0: And the sole reason you have the title of producer.

624
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,459
Speaker 1: I guess you're the CTO at this point.

625
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:44,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm the chief technical officer.

626
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,552
Speaker 0: I'm the CMO.

627
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:48,097
Speaker 1: Ah, like anyway.

628
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,900
Speaker 1: So roll through the ages or Chicago Express.

629
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,800
Speaker 0: Well, let's do Chicago Express first.

630
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,300
Speaker 0: So we're hanging at the board game night and we played roll to the ages.

631
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:01,360
Speaker 0: But then after he played roll to the ages, which we'll talk about second.

632
00:30:01,684 --> 00:30:02,499
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm mixing it up.

633
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,658
Speaker 0: It's all crap out now.

634
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:12,840
Speaker 0: The guy who is playing with us, he had some games and one of the games he had with them was it was basically rare or tycoon on a different map.

635
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,720
Speaker 0: And I was like, all right, I'm not I like to play something I haven't played before.

636
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,959
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, we actually kind of wanted to play that game until we realized it wouldn't fit on the table.

637
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:21,344
Speaker 1: Yeah.

638
00:30:21,385 --> 00:30:22,519
Speaker 1: Then we're like, what's this other game?

639
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:27,820
Speaker 1: Once he started explaining the mechanics of Chicago Express, it is not the best game in the world.

640
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:34,480
Speaker 1: It has got some flaws that we'll talk about, but it has got some novel fucking mechanics that I want to steal for another game.

641
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,620
Speaker 0: And if they're not novel, I haven't seen them before.

642
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,039
Speaker 0: And I've seen a lot of fucking games.

643
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,660
Speaker 1: Now, some games have done this, but it's a train game.

644
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:42,900
Speaker 1: It's not a crayon train game.

645
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,600
Speaker 0: No, it's a. it's a wooden train train.

646
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,560
Speaker 1: But the deal is you don't own a railroad.

647
00:30:47,882 --> 00:30:49,120
Speaker 1: No, you don't own shit.

648
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,400
Speaker 1: You've got money and your goal is to have the most money at the end.

649
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:54,980
Speaker 0: Nothing else matters is just money.

650
00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:01,960
Speaker 0: And the thing is that always gets away from me in those kind of games is like you forget the victory condition when it's, you know, and like.

651
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:07,539
Speaker 0: you'll have some thing, some resource and you'll pump it up or you'll put a bunch of money into it to pump it up.

652
00:31:08,142 --> 00:31:10,160
Speaker 0: And all you did was dump a bunch of money away.

653
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,740
Speaker 0: You pump something up, but you needed that money to win.

654
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,558
Speaker 0: And now you spent it.

655
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:19,860
Speaker 0: And now you're going to lose because that thing you pumped up isn't actually going to get you more money than you spent to pump it.

656
00:31:20,202 --> 00:31:21,280
Speaker 0: And that was stupid.

657
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:26,195
Speaker 1: I also like games where they have the mechanic of basically spending your victory points to get more.

658
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:26,758
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

659
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:32,960
Speaker 1: But the deal is you start everyone starts with money and there's railroads on the board and each one has a different number of shares.

660
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,379
Speaker 1: It can sell and it has its own bank.

661
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:42,240
Speaker 1: The only thing you can do with money is bid on and buy shares of stock in railway companies.

662
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,916
Speaker 0: So, for example, the yellow railroad starts in a specific spot and it has six shares.

663
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:47,239
Speaker 0: That's it.

664
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:47,991
Speaker 0: And the green.

665
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:48,500
Speaker 0: What was it?

666
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,380
Speaker 0: The green one had three.

667
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,433
Speaker 0: No, the red one has three shares.

668
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,500
Speaker 1: Yellow one had a bunch.

669
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:53,574
Speaker 1: They're all different.

670
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:53,819
Speaker 1: Yeah.

671
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:56,740
Speaker 1: And each one is a different number of railroad bits.

672
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,017
Speaker 1: They can put down like track.

673
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,080
Speaker 1: So a railroad can only build track by spending its own money.

674
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,920
Speaker 0: So if I buy a share of red for 10 bucks, that means that red now has 10 bucks.

675
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,767
Speaker 0: I don't have 10 bucks.

676
00:32:11,191 --> 00:32:12,080
Speaker 0: Red has 10 bucks.

677
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:19,740
Speaker 0: And anyone who has a share, at least one share of red, can use that 10 bucks to buy trains and make red travel someplace.

678
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,285
Speaker 1: Now, think of this.

679
00:32:20,427 --> 00:32:21,399
Speaker 1: Only three shares of red.

680
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,840
Speaker 1: If all three shares, like you say, I'm clever and I waste everyone else's money.

681
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,040
Speaker 1: and then I bid and buy all three shares of red.

682
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,300
Speaker 1: So no one else can get in for like nothing.

683
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:37,120
Speaker 0: Let's say everyone lets me buy red for cheap and I get all three shares of red for like a dollar.

684
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,564
Speaker 1: All right.

685
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:38,619
Speaker 1: There's a dollar in the bank.

686
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,700
Speaker 1: There's almost no way to get more money into that railroad.

687
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,820
Speaker 1: That railroad is fucked.

688
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,179
Speaker 1: These shares are nothing to me.

689
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:44,621
Speaker 0: Red.

690
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:46,179
Speaker 0: I have all three shares of red.

691
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:47,959
Speaker 0: It doesn't have any more shares to sell.

692
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,519
Speaker 0: Red only has three dollars.

693
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,199
Speaker 0: Three dollars buys red.

694
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:52,439
Speaker 0: Exactly one train.

695
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:57,260
Speaker 0: And it needs like a whole bunch of trains to be able to get across the board to Chicago where you win.

696
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,959
Speaker 0: You know, you get a bunch of points to win.

697
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:00,770
Speaker 0: So so you've got.

698
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:02,160
Speaker 1: you can't just get the shares for cheap.

699
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:03,779
Speaker 1: You want to get the shares for cheap.

700
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:07,939
Speaker 1: But getting the shares for cheap hurts the railroad that you just got into.

701
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:13,640
Speaker 0: So, but then again, if you overpay, the railroad have way more money than it needs and you will have less victory points because you wait.

702
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,040
Speaker 0: You just pump them into a railroad.

703
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,899
Speaker 0: You over and they're not helping you win.

704
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,765
Speaker 0: You overpaid.

705
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:19,480
Speaker 1: someone else buys in for cheap.

706
00:33:19,762 --> 00:33:23,052
Speaker 1: But then they basically get half of your money to build up the railroad.

707
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:23,720
Speaker 1: You share the point.

708
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,252
Speaker 0: I buy a share of red for 20 bucks.

709
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,480
Speaker 0: Rim buys a share of red for one dollar.

710
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:36,679
Speaker 0: Now, Ram is basically using my twenty dollars to buy trains on the red railroad and they get him just as many points as they get me.

711
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:37,564
Speaker 0: It's just.

712
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:44,760
Speaker 0: I'm basically making 19 points less because I spent 19 points more to get my share and I now have equal standing.

713
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:49,200
Speaker 1: So Ram is now ahead by a lot to build tracks from a railroad.

714
00:33:49,703 --> 00:33:52,980
Speaker 1: You have to own shares in it, at least one.

715
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:58,940
Speaker 1: So if three people own shares in one color, any of those three people on their turn can spend their action to build tracks.

716
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:07,420
Speaker 1: So say I own a share in a railroad that the with the current winner also own shares in and I own shares in another railroad where the current winner does not have any shares.

717
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:15,340
Speaker 1: I might sabotage the one that I share with the winner by just wasting its money and sending tracks off through the mountains into nowhere.

718
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,699
Speaker 0: Let me let me return to the previous example, right?

719
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:19,040
Speaker 0: Except we're going to cricket a little.

720
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,500
Speaker 0: So I buy a share of red for 20.

721
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,380
Speaker 0: I buy another share of red for 20.

722
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,034
Speaker 0: Now, red has 40 bucks.

723
00:34:25,054 --> 00:34:25,520
Speaker 0: That's a lot.

724
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:29,120
Speaker 0: And I've got two out of the three shares in the whole game.

725
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:30,391
Speaker 0: I am the king of red.

726
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:31,360
Speaker 0: That is bad ass.

727
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,639
Speaker 0: That is probably going to make me win.

728
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,719
Speaker 0: But rim comes in and for one dollar, he buys the final share of red.

729
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,623
Speaker 0: I get a third of the.

730
00:34:37,665 --> 00:34:40,280
Speaker 0: I could not stop him from doing this now.

731
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:47,480
Speaker 0: Not only is he going to get all these points and bunch of all the money and income from the red railroad, but he can just sabotage the red railroad.

732
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:55,978
Speaker 0: He can spend my forty dollars and his one dollar that were pumped into red and build trains is going off into the middle of nowhere that suck and don't really do anything.

733
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,420
Speaker 0: Thus sabotaging my forty dollar investment and taking me out on the cheap.

734
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:06,075
Speaker 1: So this meta mechanic of buying stock and then using the money, it's really fun.

735
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,680
Speaker 1: Like, I love this mechanic.

736
00:35:09,121 --> 00:35:12,160
Speaker 1: The other cool thing is so you've got players, you've got three little sliders.

737
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,179
Speaker 1: One is like, well, like spinny things gauges.

738
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,000
Speaker 1: One is improve something.

739
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,679
Speaker 1: One is start an auction and one is late track.

740
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:24,079
Speaker 1: So on your turn, you pick one of those three actions and move the slider up.

741
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:27,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, the slider starts on green as a couple of spaces and goes to red.

742
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:32,040
Speaker 1: If you move it to red, no one else can do that action for the rest of the turn.

743
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,379
Speaker 0: So after like three or four auctions, no more auctions this turn.

744
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,860
Speaker 1: The turn does not end until two of the three sliders have gotten to red.

745
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:47,520
Speaker 0: So if I do all the auctions, then we everyone needs to either build tracks or build little development houses, which is booster points.

746
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,820
Speaker 0: That's all they do until one of them is full up.

747
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,199
Speaker 0: And then we can go to the next turn.

748
00:35:52,581 --> 00:35:55,938
Speaker 1: So it basically it's a similar idea to the rondel.

749
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:58,013
Speaker 0: All the rondel.

750
00:35:58,053 --> 00:35:58,499
Speaker 0: Yeah.

751
00:35:58,862 --> 00:35:59,306
Speaker 0: What game?

752
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:00,540
Speaker 1: I forget the name of that game.

753
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:06,280
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, the rondel is basically the same kind of mechanic to regulate the actions the players take.

754
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,065
Speaker 0: And Tiki.

755
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the game.

756
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,420
Speaker 0: I mean, let me see if it's Antique.

757
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,300
Speaker 1: But these these two mechanics together are just really awesome.

758
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,699
Speaker 1: And the game is really fun.

759
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:26,659
Speaker 1: And I imagine if you have skilled players playing the game, it's a lot like Age of Steam in that you've got a lot of very high powered, high level play.

760
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,740
Speaker 1: Good players will kind of faint and duck each other and bidding.

761
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:31,935
Speaker 1: And there's a lot going on.

762
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:35,920
Speaker 1: But the game is not balanced terribly well.

763
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,360
Speaker 1: And unlike Age of Steam, which will kick a player out of the game, you can be mathematically eliminated from winning pretty easily.

764
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,677
Speaker 1: And you're stuck playing this game and there's nothing you can do.

765
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:45,777
Speaker 0: Yeah.

766
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:48,819
Speaker 1: I was in that situation, actually, the first time we played.

767
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:50,700
Speaker 0: Well, the only time we played.

768
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,759
Speaker 1: Yes, I was mathematically eliminated from victory.

769
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:54,740
Speaker 1: There was no way for me to exit the game.

770
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:58,939
Speaker 1: And there was no way for me to alter the course of the game, except possibly the king make.

771
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,220
Speaker 0: It's pretty much a Nash equilibrium situation, right?

772
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:05,879
Speaker 0: Because the guy who knew how to play, who owned the game, he had this green railroad to himself early on.

773
00:37:06,463 --> 00:37:08,859
Speaker 0: And he sort of, you know, remembered the money was the way to win.

774
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:10,860
Speaker 0: We pretty much couldn't catch up to him.

775
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:25,798
Speaker 0: And it was a situation we couldn't end the game because buying a share, any of the remaining shares on the board would have been a stupid move because the minimum cost of any of the shares on the board was greater than the amount of money you would have gotten from owning the share.

776
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,260
Speaker 0: Thus, buying any share on the board would only hurt two.

777
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,679
Speaker 0: It would only cause you to lose money.

778
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,080
Speaker 1: That's how the game can easily fall into the situation.

779
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,327
Speaker 0: The game would not end because to make the game end, you would have had to buy a share.

780
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:41,860
Speaker 1: where a player has to do an action that will guaranteed lose them the game to end the game.

781
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:47,520
Speaker 1: But if they don't do that, the player who's winning just continues to pull further ahead and they lose anyway.

782
00:37:48,585 --> 00:37:50,740
Speaker 0: So it has a game's over, but it's not over.

783
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:54,040
Speaker 1: So someone has to suicide to end the fucking game.

784
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:58,940
Speaker 0: Or you can just wait till it ends from running out of houses or trains or whatever, which takes forever.

785
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:01,658
Speaker 0: So and there's still no way that you can catch up.

786
00:38:02,202 --> 00:38:07,351
Speaker 1: So I don't know if I would necessarily recommend buying the game, but the mechanics are.

787
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:10,820
Speaker 1: you've got to play the game at least once and check out these mechanics as a whole.

788
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:17,040
Speaker 0: The game has some flaws, but that mechanic of the putting money into the railroads and getting the shares is awesome.

789
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,119
Speaker 0: And if you could take that mechanic elsewhere, it'd be great.

790
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:24,019
Speaker 0: OK, so, yeah, and TK is the is the game that does have the rondel.

791
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:25,657
Speaker 0: But apparently right.

792
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,259
Speaker 0: Get this is actually a rondel series.

793
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:36,720
Speaker 0: It consists of this antique hamburgum, imperial, imperial, twenty, thirty hamburgum and a game called Navigator.

794
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,400
Speaker 0: And they all have the rondel, as you can see here.

795
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:45,940
Speaker 0: And actually, the imperial game is ranked number 30 on board game geek.

796
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:48,519
Speaker 0: If I am not mistaken, let me just confirm this.

797
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:50,819
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's that's pretty good.

798
00:38:51,141 --> 00:38:52,317
Speaker 0: And watch out, watch out for the rondel.

799
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:53,677
Speaker 1: So it's a game to play.

800
00:38:54,684 --> 00:38:56,098
Speaker 1: You it'd be fun to buy.

801
00:38:56,602 --> 00:39:05,539
Speaker 1: Now, if you have money to, you know, spend on it, basically, but I'm not going to buy it because I'd like to play it maybe one more time with like all skilled players, and that's it.

802
00:39:06,162 --> 00:39:06,383
Speaker 0: Yeah.

803
00:39:06,423 --> 00:39:12,720
Speaker 0: Imperial is a game from two thousand and six section new game in the rondel series, and it's ranked number 30.

804
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,556
Speaker 1: So the other game we played that Scott bought and I think it was a good purchase Yahtzee through the ages, the Bronze Age.

805
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,080
Speaker 0: So basically I was looking to spiel this yar winning nominated games.

806
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,519
Speaker 0: The winner was dish it right or Dixit or whatever you pronounce it dish it.

807
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,345
Speaker 0: But I don't care.

808
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,480
Speaker 0: That's the game of the bunnies and the storytelling.

809
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:32,989
Speaker 0: But the the nominated.

810
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,480
Speaker 0: one of the nominated games was roll through the ages.

811
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,060
Speaker 0: And at first I was confused because I already had through the ages.

812
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:40,500
Speaker 0: And I thought roll through the ages was an expansion.

813
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,525
Speaker 0: It's not it's.

814
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:51,040
Speaker 0: it's completely own game has nothing to do with through the ages, except for they named it that to try to sell it the same way that Carcassonne cities was trying to sell copies with the name Carcassonne.

815
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:51,411
Speaker 0: Right.

816
00:39:51,494 --> 00:39:51,679
Speaker 0: Same.

817
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:59,400
Speaker 0: It's like, hey, buy Starfarers of Catan.

818
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,062
Speaker 0: It's.

819
00:40:00,082 --> 00:40:04,103
Speaker 0: it is similar to Settlers of Catan mechanically, but it really is its own game.

820
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:06,338
Speaker 0: And we're just trying to use the Catan name to sell it to you.

821
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:09,200
Speaker 0: That's that's basically what goes on with roll through the ages.

822
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:15,619
Speaker 0: Roll the ages completely standalone game has nothing to do with through the ages, but they call it through the ages to try to sell it to you.

823
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:20,306
Speaker 1: So it is Yahtzee, but it has interesting mechanics of like getting goods, spending the goods.

824
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:22,640
Speaker 0: Basically Yahtzee is a random game.

825
00:40:23,022 --> 00:40:30,878
Speaker 0: And the only thing is that when you roll the dice in Yahtzee, there's sometimes there's a slight risk calculation, like should they go for Yahtzee or should they go for a large straight, you know?

826
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:46,580
Speaker 0: And sometimes in Yahtzee, you could score something two different ways and say sometimes, you know, not one hundred percent perfect answer to which area you should score it under because you don't know what you're going to roll, in which case it's arbitrary.

827
00:40:46,742 --> 00:40:47,880
Speaker 1: And that's why the game breaks down.

828
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:52,679
Speaker 0: It's basically a game of just playing the odds and knowing where to score different rolls and then luck.

829
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,040
Speaker 0: So roll through the ages is almost the same game as Yahtzee.

830
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:02,060
Speaker 0: You roll, you pick up the dice, you don't like you roll them again, you pick up the dice, you don't like you roll them again and then you score whatever's remaining.

831
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:13,400
Speaker 0: The difference is that you start with only three dice and instead of just scoring in different rows, you actually use the dice as sort of resources to build a, quote, civilization, right?

832
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,719
Speaker 0: You can use your resources to get food.

833
00:41:16,284 --> 00:41:18,500
Speaker 0: You can use it to get more dice, which are cities.

834
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:28,079
Speaker 0: You can use it to get developments, which give you special bonus powers, or you can use it to build monuments and monuments give you victory points and so to developments and other things.

835
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:34,980
Speaker 0: So what happens is you're trying to roll different dice to get, you know, it's like I need workers that I can build this monument.

836
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:41,460
Speaker 0: I need food so I can feed my cities because every turn you lose food for you to pay one food for every dice that you roll.

837
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,120
Speaker 0: And if you don't have enough food, you lose points.

838
00:41:45,281 --> 00:41:51,360
Speaker 0: And if you roll, you know, you can roll skulls, which give you lots of goods, which turn into money to buy developments.

839
00:41:51,581 --> 00:41:55,800
Speaker 0: But too many skulls cause disasters, which also make you lose victory points.

840
00:41:56,001 --> 00:42:06,424
Speaker 0: So, you know, you're doing this careful balancing act of rolling the dice, trying to get a lot of points, but you're also trying not to lose a lot of points at the same time.

841
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:08,580
Speaker 0: And it's not just an obvious way to score.

842
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,220
Speaker 0: You know, it actually takes a lot of figuring out.

843
00:42:11,682 --> 00:42:14,880
Speaker 0: And you're not just trying to do something like roll five exactly the same.

844
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,979
Speaker 0: You're trying to, you know, get specific things in a good mix here and there.

845
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:21,027
Speaker 1: Now, the game is not like.

846
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:24,780
Speaker 1: it's fun, but it's definitely not a perfect game, at least not the default rules.

847
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,920
Speaker 1: You know, the basic rules, it's pretty much just a solitaire.

848
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:31,380
Speaker 1: And you just have to keep track of like who's built what and plan around it.

849
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,440
Speaker 1: Like he's building a great pyramid.

850
00:42:32,521 --> 00:42:33,537
Speaker 1: Maybe I shouldn't start it.

851
00:42:34,182 --> 00:42:37,440
Speaker 0: The default game definitely is very solitary.

852
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:44,160
Speaker 0: You're just really racing against the other people to see who, you know, when the game, you know, I guess the gaming ending depends on all the players.

853
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,279
Speaker 0: But it's basically who can get the most points before the game ends.

854
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,700
Speaker 0: However, there are a couple of aspects of the game that are interactive, right?

855
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,619
Speaker 0: If I build a monument, say I build a pyramid, it gives me 12 points.

856
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,900
Speaker 0: Now, anyone else who builds the pyramid after me only gets six points.

857
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,320
Speaker 0: So being the first to build a monument is good.

858
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,680
Speaker 0: Also, there is an optional rule where you can trade goods with each other.

859
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,537
Speaker 0: I'm not sure how useful that actually is.

860
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:14,300
Speaker 0: And the disaster is if there are certain disasters, like if you roll three skulls, you can actually hurt everybody else with pestilence, but not yourself.

861
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:14,641
Speaker 1: Yeah.

862
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:21,660
Speaker 1: And the improvements you can build with your goods along the way can do stuff like I get more workers, I'm not affected by pestilence, things like that.

863
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:29,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is if you go to their website, right, they have this optional, like advanced through the ages rule set.

864
00:43:29,322 --> 00:43:30,799
Speaker 0: It's like called something else.

865
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,330
Speaker 0: It's called like what is it?

866
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:35,018
Speaker 0: Let's see.

867
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,800
Speaker 1: Regardless, it doesn't matter.

868
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,480
Speaker 0: It doesn't, but they have an expansion.

869
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:54,103
Speaker 0: The expansion consists of a different score sheet that has more developments on it that are more interactive with the other players that the game could definitely use some interaction.

870
00:43:54,123 --> 00:43:57,063
Speaker 1: Now, I know there's the variant that lets you trade goods and there's like trade.

871
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:58,159
Speaker 0: I already talked about that.

872
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:11,976
Speaker 1: But yeah, OK, so that, yeah, I guess that I worry that this game cannot be made very interactive without running into the kind of Agricola end game of it's fiddly and not fun to do that sort of interaction or running into the Settlers end game of.

873
00:44:12,338 --> 00:44:19,378
Speaker 1: I'll never trade with anyone because if I trade with someone, it'll either help them win or they're stupid and they'll help me win.

874
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:28,860
Speaker 0: OK, so yeah, the one that we that when you buy the box, it's roll through the ages, the Bronze Age, but the the advanced one is roll to the ages, the late Bronze Age.

875
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,359
Speaker 1: It's a print, the late Bronze Age.

876
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:32,002
Speaker 0: It's the.

877
00:44:32,123 --> 00:44:47,100
Speaker 0: it's a print and play expansion, according to Board Game Geek, has a set of additional rules and a new score sheet that you just download, which is and has four new developments and it changes the cost and reward of five other developments.

878
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:56,940
Speaker 0: And trading between players is now just a rule, you know, and there's also a shipping development that allows you some resource conversion, I guess.

879
00:44:57,881 --> 00:45:05,084
Speaker 0: The thing is, right, that you buy let's say you decide that late Bronze Age is better than Bronze Age.

880
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:08,903
Speaker 0: You like the more interactive game with the fixed rules better than the original game.

881
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:14,380
Speaker 0: So you bought this game and most of what's in the box is this big score pad full of score sheets.

882
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,543
Speaker 0: It's a big pad.

883
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:19,220
Speaker 0: And now you're just going to use this score sheet that you print online.

884
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,100
Speaker 0: You're not going to use the score sheet that came with the game.

885
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,340
Speaker 0: And you have this big pad of useless score sheets you're never going to use.

886
00:45:23,561 --> 00:45:27,160
Speaker 0: Awesome, not awesome.

887
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:47,019
Speaker 0: If they should have just made it errata and they should have just started printing the new editions of the game with the newer different score sheet and, you know, pretended and maybe sent out a free pad of new score sheets to everyone who bought the original because you don't need anything else but the different score sheet and maybe a rule explanation for to do late Bronze Age.

888
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,780
Speaker 1: So I think it's worth owning because it's a good social game like whip out at a con.

889
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,465
Speaker 1: It's quick.

890
00:45:51,807 --> 00:45:53,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's easy or it's portable.

891
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,819
Speaker 0: Everyone, you know, knows how to play it because it's Yahtzee.

892
00:45:57,101 --> 00:45:57,344
Speaker 0: Right.

893
00:45:57,405 --> 00:45:58,760
Speaker 0: People like civilization.

894
00:45:59,064 --> 00:46:00,199
Speaker 0: You can teach it quickly.

895
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:02,739
Speaker 0: It's not just obvious how to win.

896
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,379
Speaker 0: There's actually something going on there.

897
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,202
Speaker 1: Like it kind of serves the same gaming purpose that raw does, but it's a better game than raw.

898
00:46:09,543 --> 00:46:18,460
Speaker 0: I think what it actually helps replace are those games like Flux and all those ones, all those games that people like to whip out real quick.

899
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,980
Speaker 0: It's like you can just whip out roll to the ages instead.

900
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,840
Speaker 0: It'll be it's much better, you know, or Dominion, depending.

901
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,280
Speaker 0: Well, Dominion is much bigger.

902
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:33,259
Speaker 0: This is the smallness and the portability and the quickness, especially if you don't bring it to me, you can basically bring this game just in a dice bag.

903
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,115
Speaker 0: Dominion has big set up time and it takes a while to.

904
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:41,280
Speaker 0: if people don't know, they have to learn it to read the cards and it takes a while to play.

905
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:43,680
Speaker 0: But this you just whip it out.

906
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,258
Speaker 0: You could teach it to someone right away and go.

907
00:46:45,963 --> 00:46:48,800
Speaker 1: Now, neither one of these games is a masterpiece by any stretch.

908
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:51,320
Speaker 1: I mean, Puerto Rico is still the number one on board.

909
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,460
Speaker 1: Game geek like a curricula and teeny and Kalis now Grande and all the games we love.

910
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,221
Speaker 1: Dominion are in the top 10.

911
00:46:57,221 --> 00:46:57,261
Speaker 1: So.

912
00:46:58,668 --> 00:47:00,999
Speaker 1: Also, Twilight Struggle is still number three.

913
00:47:01,724 --> 00:47:03,039
Speaker 1: I know what people see in that game.

914
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:03,746
Speaker 0: You still have it.

915
00:47:03,847 --> 00:47:04,980
Speaker 0: Yes, they'll have it on play.

916
00:47:05,942 --> 00:47:09,519
Speaker 1: I kind of do, but every time we try to play it halfway through, I say fuck this.

917
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:14,360
Speaker 0: So if only it was digitized, I think there is a digital version somewhere.

918
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:14,806
Speaker 0: We should go.

919
00:47:14,826 --> 00:47:15,758
Speaker 1: I should look into that.

920
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, because then it might make it easier for us to to play the game because we wouldn't worry about messing up rules.

921
00:47:22,121 --> 00:47:26,920
Speaker 0: And we also would not have trouble with the extended set up time and such.

922
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:37,462
Speaker 1: And so I guess if you don't own or haven't played Puerto Rico, Agricola, Power Grid, Dominion, Kalis, El Grande, Tigers and Euphrates, Goa, Shogun, we don't even have Goa.

923
00:47:37,663 --> 00:47:40,276
Speaker 1: I know I would buy and play all of those before.

924
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,441
Speaker 1: I would buy roll through the ages.

925
00:47:42,264 --> 00:47:46,541
Speaker 1: And I or Chicago Express, I wouldn't buy Chicago Express, but I'd play it again.

926
00:47:46,562 --> 00:47:47,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would.

927
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,200
Speaker 0: definitely I want to play it one more time.

928
00:47:49,381 --> 00:47:55,259
Speaker 0: Just now concentrating, knowing if I did, because I know that if I play it again, I'm going to concentrate on money is the key.

929
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,739
Speaker 1: I like how the Wabash railroad comes out like right at the end.

930
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,043
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

931
00:47:59,063 --> 00:48:00,239
Speaker 0: It's like this black trains.

932
00:48:00,421 --> 00:48:03,298
Speaker 0: And as soon as someone actually gets to Chicago, the black train appears.

933
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,105
Speaker 1: There's also this whole mechanic of like.

934
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:10,280
Speaker 1: the more money a company is making, the more the minimum bid is on the shares.

935
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:16,785
Speaker 1: So if you can pump the value of a train company up to prevent other people from bidding on shares.

936
00:48:18,876 --> 00:48:19,720
Speaker 0: Very interesting.

937
00:48:20,162 --> 00:48:20,324
Speaker 1: Yeah.

938
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:21,320
Speaker 1: It's just I don't know.

939
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,224
Speaker 1: I feel like the math could be tweaked to make it a bit like a perfect game or at least a great game.

940
00:48:25,627 --> 00:48:27,280
Speaker 1: But it falls short because the math isn't great.

941
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,784
Speaker 0: I think they just need to change the end game condition a little bit so that the game actually ends.

942
00:48:31,885 --> 00:48:40,880
Speaker 1: Well, I feel like if I have to update, losing should be fun for whenever we run it again, because I have the train game examples of how Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon handle this in two different ways.

943
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,177
Speaker 1: I want to add Chicago Express in to point out this game doesn't handle it.

944
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,680
Speaker 1: Three train games for the same example.

945
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,182
Speaker 1: I like that.

946
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:49,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, the roll to the ages.

947
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,499
Speaker 0: Definitely a big improvement on Yahtzee.

948
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,619
Speaker 0: Throw your Yahtzee away.

949
00:48:54,021 --> 00:48:58,180
Speaker 0: And Chicago Express, interesting bidding mechanic on the shares of the railroad.

950
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:06,440
Speaker 1: Any game designers out there steal from the forgotten masters in this game isn't even that old or forgotten, but game mechanics aren't copyrightable there.

951
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:06,802
Speaker 0: Yeah.

952
00:49:07,268 --> 00:49:07,957
Speaker 0: So just go for it.

953
00:49:14,894 --> 00:49:17,030
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
