1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,759
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, December 13th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:09,980
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:13,890
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,417
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,437 --> 00:00:17,569
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about playing on teams.

6
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:20,108
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:35,890
Speaker 0: So, I'm pretty sure I told the story on the show where that old car that we have, like, basically had a problem and overheated and low-key exploded on the GWB at midnight, coming home from a family thing on Thanksgiving.

8
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:37,949
Speaker 0: So, the saga has ended.

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,230
Speaker 0: Today, I picked the car up from the garage where I normally keep it to give it to a guy who is going to tow it away.

10
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,230
Speaker 0: They're going to figure out how much they can scrap it for, and it's going to be a charitable donation.

11
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,170
Speaker 0: I did not donate it to the evil Cars for Kids.

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:01,370
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, what they're doing is they give the money to, you know, to run, like, their Hasidic schools in the Jewish neighborhood, right?

13
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:04,010
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's like, oh, it's for kids.

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,630
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, but they didn't say which kids or what.

15
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,923
Speaker 1: It's not like, it's like, they're just like, for kids, which kids?

16
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:12,429
Speaker 1: Kids in a hospital, right?

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,110
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they're funding their schools, right?

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,650
Speaker 1: And it's like, okay, you know, if it was like, you know, a Catholic school, right?

19
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,910
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, but Catholic schools go around and say, hey, give money to the Catholic school.

20
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,628
Speaker 0: They're at least up front about it.

21
00:01:28,553 --> 00:01:28,773
Speaker 1: Yeah.

22
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:33,510
Speaker 1: And it's like, and the problem is, it's like, okay, you have a religious school, right?

23
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,390
Speaker 1: You know, whether I believe in your religion or not, right?

24
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,550
Speaker 0: I wouldn't even be that opposed, you know, as much of an angry atheist as I am.

25
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:42,890
Speaker 0: I am not even opposed to that.

26
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:50,810
Speaker 0: It's specifically that is for schools primarily in the areas that are basically under apartheid rule in Palestine.

27
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:52,990
Speaker 1: No, it's for schools in Brooklyn.

28
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,209
Speaker 0: No, I just read a thing on this.

29
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:01,630
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is, is that, A, there's the deception, right?

30
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,990
Speaker 1: But the real problem is that those schools, right?

31
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:11,268
Speaker 1: Unlike, you know, not trying to give credit to Catholic schools here because they don't deserve it.

32
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,729
Speaker 1: They got a lot of problems.

33
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:19,190
Speaker 1: But those schools basically do not teach the children properly, right?

34
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:20,213
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

35
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:24,730
Speaker 0: There was that New York State huge report that just came out talking about the city.

36
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,517
Speaker 1: Maybe it just came out.

37
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:26,930
Speaker 1: This has been going on for decades.

38
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,510
Speaker 0: No, but there was a giant investigative journalism thing that dropped this year.

39
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,430
Speaker 1: The investigative journalism has been ongoing.

40
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,210
Speaker 1: It's not like something that just happened.

41
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,129
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, this was not unknown, but this report was huge.

42
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,870
Speaker 0: It was like 30 pages long and had all this data.

43
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,430
Speaker 1: There's been many, it's just one in a line of many things, right?

44
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:53,330
Speaker 1: But the point is, is that basically they run these schools and they don't teach, you know, math, English, you know, the required subjects, right?

45
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:01,009
Speaker 1: They'll just, there have been videos showing like schools, like just cheating, like to make sure the kids pass these tests.

46
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,670
Speaker 1: Kids who were not, you know, because basically they only teach the kids what they want to teach them.

47
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,929
Speaker 1: Imagine if someone went to Catholic school and they only had religious class and didn't have a math class at all.

48
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,150
Speaker 0: In fact, you know, as an elementary school, I went to a Catholic school and the math classes were better than the public schools.

49
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:25,250
Speaker 0: Basically everything was better except, and it's sad, but I hate to say this, the science classes were actually religiously bullshit, right?

50
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,970
Speaker 1: But the point, you know, there's a state laws that say, you know, federal laws even, right?

51
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,372
Speaker 1: I don't know.

52
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:35,270
Speaker 1: I don't know what the laws are specifically, but there is a legal standard of you.

53
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:42,170
Speaker 1: No matter if you're going to have a home school, a private school, whatever, you have to teach these things to this level, right?

54
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,610
Speaker 1: There are these standardized tests and the, you know, overall the, you know, sure.

55
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:53,030
Speaker 1: Some kids might fail, some kids might get an A, but it's like if everyone fails, clearly the school is responsible.

56
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,209
Speaker 1: They didn't teach it, right?

57
00:03:55,091 --> 00:04:00,290
Speaker 1: So these, some of these schools, there are yeshiva schools that are teaching properly, right?

58
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:21,230
Speaker 1: But then there are some that are not and they're, you know, and the cars for kids money funds those schools to raise the children of very religious Jews in a way that is not legal, but they get away with it due to politics, but the pressure has been mounting and continues to mount, but still has not cracked.

59
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:25,470
Speaker 0: The most fascinating thing that came out of that big investigative journalism thing was the test scores.

60
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,130
Speaker 0: The girls' schools actually have way better test scores in secular subjects than the boys' schools.

61
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:37,370
Speaker 1: Because the girls aren't given the religious education.

62
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:43,190
Speaker 0: So where I donated the car was actually the New York, WNYC, like the New York City radio station.

63
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,810
Speaker 0: They have a more generic, we'll take a car and deal with it charity.

64
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:53,910
Speaker 0: But the funniest thing is I donated it and they were shocked that it moves, that it drives, that it has an engine.

65
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:57,030
Speaker 0: They were like, this might be the best car anyone's ever donated to us.

66
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,246
Speaker 0: They were really funny about it.

67
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I imagine most people donate a car, donating cars that don't move, right?

68
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:07,510
Speaker 0: While this car moves, for those of you who know cars, the rear seal is blown out.

69
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,096
Speaker 0: The car has no oil in it.

70
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:12,689
Speaker 0: I have driven it like five times with no oil in it.

71
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:13,994
Speaker 0: It still goes.

72
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:17,129
Speaker 0: It feels like it's fine if you don't know there's no oil in it.

73
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,970
Speaker 1: Why didn't you just buy an oil at the gas station and just pour it in?

74
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,557
Speaker 0: Because it would spurt right back out.

75
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:25,390
Speaker 0: The rear seal is blown because it overheated catastrophically.

76
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:28,109
Speaker 0: I'm real lucky it didn't catch fire.

77
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:34,410
Speaker 1: But the point is, even if it comes back out, it'll at least lubricate the insides a little.

78
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,510
Speaker 1: It's not like all of it would just fall out the bottom, right?

79
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,850
Speaker 0: I mean, there is residual oil in the oil pan and in the engine itself, but the dipstick will show zero.

80
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:44,135
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

81
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:45,290
Speaker 1: I mean, that's going to happen.

82
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:46,848
Speaker 0: But it doesn't matter because they took it.

83
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:50,703
Speaker 0: But the opening bit, the part that was interesting is the tow.

84
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,570
Speaker 0: truck driver was super cool.

85
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,232
Speaker 0: He comes over.

86
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:57,790
Speaker 0: I drove the car to a place that would be easy for him to get it and he was very appreciative of that.

87
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:02,889
Speaker 0: Because if you don't live in New York City, like you imagine a tow truck and you think, yeah, it could just pick up a car.

88
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:11,490
Speaker 0: New York City does not have a lot of places a tow truck can maneuver, especially like outside of big roads, like where the car is normally parked.

89
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,330
Speaker 0: I don't think a tow truck could even get in there easily.

90
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:21,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, but despite that fact, right, you know, trying to tow one car in a crowded, tight place with a giant tow truck, right?

91
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,830
Speaker 1: But whenever New York wants to tow, right, it's like, oh, a marathon's coming through.

92
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,461
Speaker 1: We're going to tow every car in the street.

93
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:28,710
Speaker 1: Oh, we're going to pave this road.

94
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,866
Speaker 0: Suddenly those cars disappear faster than you can imagine.

95
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:32,530
Speaker 0: It's like magic.

96
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,449
Speaker 1: Somehow they managed to make that happen.

97
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,209
Speaker 1: When they really want to make it happen.

98
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:37,378
Speaker 1: Oh, parade.

99
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,410
Speaker 1: Got to tow all the cars.

100
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,033
Speaker 1: Guess what?

101
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,770
Speaker 1: Overnight, every single car will be gone, right?

102
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,270
Speaker 1: So when they want to tow, the city can tow, right?

103
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,309
Speaker 1: And I'm like, just deploy that towing power all the time, right?

104
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,430
Speaker 1: Double parked, tow, right?

105
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,610
Speaker 1: Beat up car that's not starting, tow.

106
00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:58,830
Speaker 0: The car that was stuck at an angle outside your apartment for several days.

107
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,142
Speaker 1: For almost a week?

108
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:00,244
Speaker 1: Tow.

109
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:14,749
Speaker 1: I think it did get towed eventually, but it's like, they should be, the aggression with which the energy they put into towing for a parade is the energy they should put into towing on a non-stop basis, right?

110
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,730
Speaker 0: But the guy was just really appreciative that I put the car somewhere easy so he didn't have to get out.

111
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,970
Speaker 0: What he said was the weird stuff, to like get it out of a garage or something.

112
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,750
Speaker 0: But then we were talking, I kind of explained what happened.

113
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,728
Speaker 0: We were just hanging out a little bit.

114
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:33,050
Speaker 0: And, you know, I almost broke down on the GWB like during heavy traffic.

115
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:34,963
Speaker 0: And the guy was basically like, whoa.

116
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:43,730
Speaker 0: And what he told me was if you had actually broken down, one, it would have been like a $700 tow truck job to get your car off of that bridge.

117
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:52,083
Speaker 0: And two, they probably would have ruined the car even more because if you break down on one of the New York City bridges, they don't just send a normal tow truck.

118
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:53,090
Speaker 0: They want to get that thing out of there.

119
00:07:53,150 --> 00:08:01,390
Speaker 0: They basically push it off the bridge with something that kind of looks like a bulldozer and often damage the car in the process.

120
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:02,581
Speaker 0: And that's on you.

121
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,368
Speaker 0: They do not care.

122
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:08,329
Speaker 1: So if you have a Ferrari and it breaks down on the bridge...

123
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,010
Speaker 0: You're in trouble.

124
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:24,709
Speaker 0: Granted, if you're the kind of person who has a Ferrari and also maintains that Ferrari to such a poor degree that it breaks down in the like 45 minutes to 3 hours that you are on the George Washington Bridge, that's on you.

125
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:31,930
Speaker 1: At least me, it's a shitty... The point is I've seen very expensive cars on New York City bridges and tunnels.

126
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:45,789
Speaker 0: Yet somehow my car that spewed all of its oil out over the span of a couple of minutes and overheated catastrophically, somehow I was able to keep driving it to get over the bridge and ditch it in the Bronx and deal with it the next day.

127
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,587
Speaker 1: That reminds me, I learned a new slang term-ish, right?

128
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:54,590
Speaker 1: The slang term is B&T, meaning bridge and tunnel.

129
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:02,686
Speaker 1: And basically, to use it in a sentence, you might say, "Ah, there's a lot of B&T in this restaurant right now," right?

130
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:04,857
Speaker 0: I've heard bridge and tunnel.

131
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,166
Speaker 0: I've never heard it shortened to B&T.

132
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,970
Speaker 0: It's the people who come into the city on bridges and through tunnels.

133
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,351
Speaker 0: That's right.

134
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:16,750
Speaker 1: When you say B&T, you're talking about like North Jersey people as a group, right?

135
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,369
Speaker 1: So those people, as a collective, you would refer to them as B&T.

136
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:30,650
Speaker 0: Oh my god, if you take a subway that connects to The Path in Manhattan on a Thursday or Friday night, the people on that train are almost exclusively those people, mostly drunk.

137
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:35,470
Speaker 0: Alright, it's gaming day and the gaming news.

138
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,145
Speaker 0: That Dwarf Fortress, the one with graphics, came out.

139
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:38,830
Speaker 0: It's on Steam.

140
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:39,232
Speaker 0: It did.

141
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:39,737
Speaker 1: We waited.

142
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:41,029
Speaker 1: We waited a long time.

143
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:46,570
Speaker 1: And finally, after 20 years, Dwarf Fortress, that isn't ASCII text.

144
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:58,088
Speaker 1: I mean, there have been mods and hacks and things, but the official Dwarf Fortress that isn't ASCII text, it has graphics and you can buy it on Steam for 20, 30 bucks, something like that, 30 bucks.

145
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,555
Speaker 0: I'm buying it.

146
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:01,989
Speaker 0: I don't even know how much I'll play it, but I gotta say...

147
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,198
Speaker 1: It's legally available.

148
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:18,269
Speaker 1: If you missed all the news stories, if you look in the Steam reviews, you know, a lot of people are like, you know, basically people who love Dwarf Fortress were like, you know, instant, just like five-star, right, reviews, a hundred thumbs up.

149
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:25,430
Speaker 0: Oh god, I just imagine, imagine if you don't know the deal about Dwarf Fortress and you see this on Steam and you just buy it and try to play it.

150
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:31,370
Speaker 1: Somebody made a comment in the reviews and the comment became semi-famous.

151
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:39,945
Speaker 1: This person making the comment clearly knew about Dwarf Fortress because they're like, "Hey, why does this game have so many just instant thumbs up?

152
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,069
Speaker 1: It's been out for like five

153
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:41,370
Speaker 1: minutes.".

154
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,751
Speaker 1: People just waiting 30 years or 20 years to pay $30.

155
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:48,150
Speaker 0: Oh, I saw that thread.

156
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so their replies were just like,

157
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:52,669
Speaker 1: "Yes.".

158
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,658
Speaker 1: People have been playing this game for free.

159
00:10:56,678 --> 00:11:00,430
Speaker 1: They love the shit out of it and they waited and waited and waited.

160
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,489
Speaker 1: It's like, all right, now you could pay money for the thing that you've been able to get for free.

161
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:06,590
Speaker 1: only it has graphics.

162
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,110
Speaker 0: I don't think it has a lot of other quality of life improvements.

163
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:22,650
Speaker 1: It has a lot of the user interface improvements I played at the beginning of a fortress and as a tutorial and there is significant quality of life improvements in terms of user interface.

164
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:38,270
Speaker 1: It's like, you don't do anything different in terms of what you have to do, the effort required to play Dwarf Fortress, but I guess figuring out user interface parts is significantly less difficult.

165
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,454
Speaker 0: Which is good.

166
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:47,970
Speaker 0: You've got Apocalypse and Doctor Doom are both coming at you and Apocalypse is busy now, so you only have to fight Doctor Doom to play this game.

167
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,969
Speaker 1: But one of the people did the math and they're like, "Well, it sold about this many copies at 30 bucks each,".

168
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,130
Speaker 1: but they had to share the money with the publisher.

169
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,830
Speaker 1: It's a good publisher, by the way.

170
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:02,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the people who also publish Boyfriend Dungeon, it's a good publisher.

171
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,470
Speaker 1: But anyway, and they're like, "Yeah, I guess they probably brought in like six million dollars-ish,".

172
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:16,910
Speaker 1: but they had to split it and Steam took a cut, we know what that is, but we don't know what the split is between the Dwarf Fortress guys and Kitfox.

173
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:25,071
Speaker 0: Never mind, Dwarf Fortress, we discovered it in like 2006, 2007?

174
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:28,750
Speaker 0: We interviewed Tarn Adams on Geek Nights in 2008?

175
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,348
Speaker 1: The point is people are like, "Whoa, millionaires now,".

176
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:38,904
Speaker 1: but Tarn Adams was basically like, "Yeah, I've probably got some millions now, but we've been working on this 20 years,".

177
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:47,429
Speaker 1: so it's like basically if I had a tech job, a normal tech salary for 20 years, and then got paid all at once.

178
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:54,944
Speaker 0: It's like that scene in The Simpsons where the kids find out how much Seymour Skinner gets paid and they're like, "30,000 dollars a year?

179
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:55,286
Speaker 0: He's a

180
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:56,009
Speaker 0: millionaire!".

181
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:01,890
Speaker 0: So there's an uncredited quote that was making the rounds today.

182
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,229
Speaker 0: that sort of sums up Dwarf Fortress in a really funny way.

183
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,717
Speaker 0: "Dwarf Fortress is good.

184
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:07,483
Speaker 0: Game of the year.

185
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:08,350
Speaker 0: Game of the century.

186
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:16,461
Speaker 0: Love to make a bunch of little guys who slowly and tragically die because they need God to tell them to make their own pants or something, and that God does not even know.

187
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,408
Speaker 0: that's a thing he can

188
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:17,569
Speaker 0: do.".

189
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:18,873
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

190
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:22,890
Speaker 0: Well, we'll review this in detail after we play it.

191
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,330
Speaker 0: I'm definitely playing it at some point.

192
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,009
Speaker 0: There's the Holiday Geek Nights hiatus coming up before too long.

193
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:39,030
Speaker 0: In some other news, so in full disclosure, as you know from previous Geek Nights, I own a good, good amount of Activision Blizzard stock.

194
00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:44,910
Speaker 0: This is not investment advice, but just full disclosure, I do own a significant amount of Activision Blizzard stock.

195
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,468
Speaker 1: So if it gets bought, you stand to, uh...

196
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:54,930
Speaker 0: Break even, 'cause the stock price pretty much got locked in at the price it was when this deal was put in place, and it was gonna be worth it.

197
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,130
Speaker 1: You bought it for less than that.

198
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:56,905
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I bought...

199
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:57,550
Speaker 1: Presumably.

200
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:07,130
Speaker 0: I, despite many ups and downs, made a not-insubstantial amount of money with my investments in Activision Blizzard over the years.

201
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:09,790
Speaker 0: It has been pretty profitable.

202
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,849
Speaker 0: I will, I have to, I should disclose that because we're talking about a bunch of news, you know, journalism, ethics and all.

203
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:24,209
Speaker 0: So the FTC now is suing to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard on antitrust grounds.

204
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,470
Speaker 0: And all I have to say, despite being a shareholder...

205
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,610
Speaker 1: Why haven't they, they gotta do this a lot more often.

206
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, why, this is what bothers me.

207
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,047
Speaker 0: On one hand...

208
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,070
Speaker 1: Yes, it's like, yes, I agree, this is an antitrust ground, good job.

209
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:42,810
Speaker 1: You should be starting with NBC, Universal, Comcast, a hundred other companies, whatever the fuck that is.

210
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:43,449
Speaker 0: This is a pattern.

211
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,570
Speaker 1: Start at the top and then work your way down.

212
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,729
Speaker 1: What are you doing starting in the middle?

213
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:47,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I know why.

214
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,970
Speaker 0: Because at the top, they got lawyers and they own politicians.

215
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,183
Speaker 0: At the bottom...

216
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,262
Speaker 1: Microsoft doesn't have lawyers?

217
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:54,769
Speaker 0: Come on.

218
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,809
Speaker 0: Compared to the top?

219
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:03,330
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, also, Microsoft, this acquisition is relatively small in the grand scheme of things for Microsoft.

220
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:05,830
Speaker 0: It's a bigger deal for Activision Blizzard, frankly.

221
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:09,810
Speaker 0: But on the bottom end, the low tier, there ain't no money there, nobody cares.

222
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:14,484
Speaker 0: The middle tier of acquisitions are the sweet spot of not so big.

223
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:20,030
Speaker 0: someone's gonna like pull rank on a senator with their money, but not so small that literally no one cares.

224
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:26,150
Speaker 0: So I feel like certain sectors get more antitrust enforcement because it's easier.

225
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:31,070
Speaker 0: It'll make the right amount of headlines, but it's like the minimum effort to make that headline.

226
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,769
Speaker 0: It's like shooting for the low B at RIT where they didn't have pluses and minuses.

227
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:37,526
Speaker 0: So I am one.

228
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:45,870
Speaker 0: I'm hugely in favor of this, even though I do stand to lose money if this goes through, because I really want to see more companies broken up just across the board.

229
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,710
Speaker 0: I don't care if it's a company I like.

230
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:50,189
Speaker 0: I don't care if it's a game I like or a product I use.

231
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,670
Speaker 0: Too many companies are too big and capital is a threat to humanity.

232
00:15:54,211 --> 00:16:03,029
Speaker 0: But that said, I'm gonna quote from this CNBC article, which is quoting one of the players here, arguing against this specific action.

233
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:07,070
Speaker 0: Microsoft faces huge challenges in the gaming industry.

234
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:13,430
Speaker 0: The Xbox console is the third place console behind both the Sony Playstation and the Nintendo Switch.

235
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,127
Speaker 0: Microsoft has "no meaningful presence in the mobile game

236
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:17,589
Speaker 0: industry.".

237
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:28,950
Speaker 0: He pointed at Apple and Google, saying that while mobile games are fast-growing and high-revenue segments, those who store operators take a significant portion of those earnings through their own fees on developers.

238
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:37,409
Speaker 0: And he basically makes an argument that, yeah, you could go after Microsoft, but if this is the threshold, you have to go after 90% of the rest of this industry, too.

239
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:38,709
Speaker 1: I agree.

240
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:39,689
Speaker 0: I agree as well.

241
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,290
Speaker 0: Now, I don't think they should give up on blocking this acquisition.

242
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:49,518
Speaker 0: I always think to that old penny arcade where Bungie is coming out of the burning building and the fireman's like, "Are you

243
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:49,860
Speaker 0: safe?"

244
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:53,662
Speaker 0: and Bungie tries to get back in, and the fireman's like, "You can't go back in there.

245
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:54,145
Speaker 0: It's a death

246
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:54,467
Speaker 0: trap.".

247
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,849
Speaker 0: But you don't understand, Blizzard's still in there.

248
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:05,890
Speaker 1: One thing you could say, right, is it might be a clever-- It could-- It's a possibility-- I doubt this.

249
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,390
Speaker 1: Is that a precedent?

250
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,730
Speaker 1: I highly doubt-- Right.

251
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:13,270
Speaker 1: That basically, by making this case, right, you could set the bar.

252
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:21,050
Speaker 1: If a judge says that this is antitrust, then it should be-- You can basically go to anything bigger, right?

253
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:30,681
Speaker 1: You could be like, "The judge said-- That other judge, we went all the way, we finished all the court cases, and they said this was too big, it was anti-trusty, right?

254
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:34,281
Speaker 1: Therefore, look at-- We're bringing Apple to court.

255
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:35,409
Speaker 1: They're bigger than that was.

256
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,810
Speaker 1: So therefore, they're also anti-trusty, right?

257
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:46,022
Speaker 1: It should be-- And hopefully-- And then, I guess, I don't know, those cases should be faster, easier, 'cause you can just keep pointing to the one that you already did.

258
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:46,926
Speaker 1: that was smaller, right?

259
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:55,582
Speaker 1: Like, if I went to go to Judge A, and Judge Solomon says, "10 is too big for a baby.

260
00:17:55,602 --> 00:17:56,448
Speaker 1: You gotta cut it in half,".

261
00:17:57,973 --> 00:18:00,490
Speaker 1: and then I go, "Well, that lady's baby's 11 pounds.

262
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:01,982
Speaker 0: That lady's baby's 12

263
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:02,488
Speaker 0: pounds.".

264
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:05,750
Speaker 1: I just show up to Solomon with all the giant babies, right?

265
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:20,869
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Well, I already said the 10-pound baby was too big, and it had to be cut in half, so I'm either gonna be really the inconsistent King Solomon, or we gotta chop up all the 11, 12-pound babies

266
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:20,949
Speaker 1: too.".

267
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,490
Speaker 0: And in mythology, King Solomon was definitely not known for being inconsistent.

268
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:37,561
Speaker 0: But that is actually a way this could go, and that's partly why, even if that is not a strategy, which it may be, like, that may well be a strategy, and why-- I don't think so.

269
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:38,830
Speaker 1: I think the chances are almost nil.

270
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:44,469
Speaker 1: It's hard to say, because games-- Gaming is also-- I think they just really love going after Microsoft.

271
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,630
Speaker 0: I would say gaming is a pretty small chunk of any industry they could go after.

272
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,420
Speaker 0: I mean, look at Disney right now.

273
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,446
Speaker 0: Look at entertainment.

274
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:53,070
Speaker 0: Look at news.

275
00:18:53,432 --> 00:19:01,470
Speaker 0: There are other industries that are so much bigger than gaming, that they alone should probably warrant almost all of the antitrust work.

276
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,569
Speaker 0: But I will take any win right now.

277
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:16,810
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter where any antitrust success is a step in the right direction, so I absolutely applaud this personally, even though I personally stand to lose, possibly, a significant amount of money if this is blocked.

278
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,509
Speaker 1: In related Blizzard news, just tiny note, right?

279
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,086
Speaker 1: The Diablo 4 is coming soon.

280
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:28,070
Speaker 1: A, I'm not gonna lie, you know, Diablo is not a good game.

281
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,981
Speaker 1: I mean, in some senses, it's a great game.

282
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,230
Speaker 1: In some senses, it's not, right?

283
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:37,470
Speaker 0: I mean, sometimes, like eating a McDonald's burger, sometimes you just want to click on devils and eventually click on Satan.

284
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,850
Speaker 1: It's a game where you click until Satan dies, right?

285
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,653
Speaker 1: But it's, you know what?

286
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:45,289
Speaker 1: I enjoy all the other three Diablos, one, two, three.

287
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,950
Speaker 1: I clicked until Satan died, and then I stopped playing, and I was not upset.

288
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,906
Speaker 1: I would click Satan to death again, right?

289
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,549
Speaker 1: And they're coming, and they're like, you know what?

290
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:57,550
Speaker 1: Would you like to click Satan to death for a fourth time?

291
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,378
Speaker 1: And I'm like, you know what?

292
00:19:58,438 --> 00:19:59,590
Speaker 1: I wouldn't mind, right?

293
00:19:59,670 --> 00:19:59,973
Speaker 1: I would.

294
00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:01,610
Speaker 1: Why not, right?

295
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,366
Speaker 1: Might not run out and do it immediately, but I would.

296
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:04,990
Speaker 1: Okay.

297
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:16,870
Speaker 1: But A, there are many reports that they are crunching and mistreating the Diablo Satan makers quite horribly.

298
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:28,070
Speaker 1: And of course, you know, you've got to consider all the things that have already happened over there, not just with the Microsoft department, but also the, you know, the sexual harassment department, right?

299
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:29,910
Speaker 1: That sort of started this whole shenanigans.

300
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,970
Speaker 1: And then, you know, the money-grubbing, right?

301
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,370
Speaker 1: Who knows what kind of microtransactions it's going to be, right?

302
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:45,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've already seen a lot of chatter and conversation and reports that the monetization is demeaningly aggressive.

303
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:56,790
Speaker 1: I'm sure the monetization will be demeaningly aggressive, but I know that me, the kind of person that I am, is that, you know, I'll pay the base price for the game, right?

304
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:05,262
Speaker 1: And even though I might end the game with, like, shitty-looking equipment, and not- Oh, I play Fortnite.

305
00:21:05,343 --> 00:21:06,048
Speaker 0: I have one skin.

306
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:07,963
Speaker 0: I bought Overwatch 1.

307
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:08,911
Speaker 0: Overwatch 2?

308
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:11,110
Speaker 0: I haven't spent one cent, nor will I ever.

309
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,870
Speaker 1: I'll have, like, no fancy items from the real money auction house.

310
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:17,450
Speaker 1: I'll have, like, you know, no special anything.

311
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,213
Speaker 0: Marvel's death.

312
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:20,529
Speaker 0: I'm using the default avatar and the default deck.

313
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:28,620
Speaker 1: If for some reason the base price of the game does not allow you to click Satan to death, then I won't play.

314
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,649
Speaker 1: I won't play it, right?

315
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:31,629
Speaker 1: But it's like, I can't imagine that.

316
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:40,634
Speaker 1: It's like, if you pay the 40, 50, 60, whatever they want to charge, just to get the game, unless it's a free-to-play game, And all bets are off.

317
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,969
Speaker 0: Free-to-play is the biggest red flag there is.

318
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,260
Speaker 1: I have a free-to-play Diablo.

319
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,309
Speaker 1: It's the mobile one, right?

320
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:59,309
Speaker 1: But they're going to charge 40 to 60 bucks for the game, and then if you pay that and do not pay a dime more, I'm 90% confident that they will let you click until Satan dies and then stop playing, which is what I plan to do.

321
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:07,790
Speaker 1: Any kind of microtransaction bullshit they put in, cosmetic or pay-to-win, it's a single-player game, so pay-to-win, who cares?

322
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:10,589
Speaker 1: I'll just win without paying more.

323
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:14,769
Speaker 1: But I don't know if I will, because they mistreated all the people who made it.

324
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:26,250
Speaker 1: I really wish the Torchbearer people -- not Torchbearer, Torchlight people -- had not fucked up, and Torchlight 3 was actually something worth playing, and the drama there didn't happen.

325
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,370
Speaker 0: Well, it's tricky, because there are -- no large game studio does not mistreat its workers right now.

326
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:33,402
Speaker 1: Yeah.

327
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,054
Speaker 1: But it's like, hey, somebody make -- You just rotate.

328
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:40,329
Speaker 0: who is getting attention for mistreating and how egregious is the mistreating at any given week.

329
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:48,130
Speaker 1: Now, there are a lot of action RPGs out there with the loot and everything, but none of them are Diablo-like, right?

330
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,569
Speaker 1: It's like, you've got to think, why haven't more people copied?

331
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:54,270
Speaker 1: -- just literally rip off that formula, don't change a fucking thing, right?

332
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:56,488
Speaker 1: Just put different skin on it.

333
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,686
Speaker 0: Yeah.

334
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,909
Speaker 0: How many games try to rip off Zelda?

335
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,850
Speaker 0: How many games try to rip off Metroidvania?

336
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:03,528
Speaker 0: There's a million clones.

337
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,770
Speaker 1: The Metroidvania ones, though, were kind of successful.

338
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:10,370
Speaker 1: The Zelda ones, that's tarred, because you need so much polish to succeed with that.

339
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,652
Speaker 1: Exactly.

340
00:23:10,673 --> 00:23:14,929
Speaker 0: There's a reason nobody's ripped off Advance Wars, except maybe one game, because you really can't.

341
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,350
Speaker 1: No, there have been quite a few that have tried.

342
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,689
Speaker 0: None of them are good, except Wargroove.

343
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:19,390
Speaker 1: Eh, anyway.

344
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,770
Speaker 0: And Wargroove is alright, but it doesn't have the polish of Advance Wars.

345
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,990
Speaker 1: But you could make a Wargroove of Diablo.

346
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:29,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, you absolutely could, if someone was willing to put that level of effort and polish in.

347
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:38,070
Speaker 0: In yet more Blizzard news, World of Warcraft, which is extremely popular in China, is going to disappear from China.

348
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:53,710
Speaker 0: Because Blizzard contracts with NetEase to offer World of Warcraft in China, and these two companies appear to have had a significant falling out, where there is continuing new reporting on the details.

349
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,430
Speaker 0: Like, no one's sure exactly what went down.

350
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:58,050
Speaker 1: Don't they have an existing contract that they have to abide by?

351
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,089
Speaker 1: Unless the term's expired and it's time to renew, in which case it makes perfect sense.

352
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:02,532
Speaker 0: Yep,

353
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:03,235
Speaker 1: but

354
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:22,750
Speaker 0: some weird statements came out around this, and there's been a lot of updates to the stories, where Weipo obtained some emails from Blizzard's president, who apparently said that there was a mismatch in values, and that there were some direct conflicts that led to them not wanting to work with NetEase in China specifically.

355
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,097
Speaker 0: There's also NetEase.

356
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:36,189
Speaker 0: actually, while they officially declined to comment on that, they issued some other statement basically saying, there's a quote that's like, "A jerk is the reason we're not doing

357
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:36,350
Speaker 0: this.".

358
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:41,569
Speaker 0: They seem to be referring to one individual, who they're calling a jerk, who is responsible for this.

359
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:48,630
Speaker 0: And this is all with the backdrop of the Chinese government over the last few years, heavily cracking down on gaming across all of China.

360
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,367
Speaker 1: I mean, if China doesn't want World of Warcraft in their country, then they won't have it.

361
00:24:54,413 --> 00:24:57,490
Speaker 1: Except for people who have a VPN and a US account.

362
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:03,150
Speaker 0: Yep, VPNs are less and less reliable in China over the last year and a half as well.

363
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:12,628
Speaker 0: So gamers are of course panicking, because a lot of them have highly leveled up characters, who they're afraid will just get deleted, and it's not clear what's going to happen to them.

364
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:28,469
Speaker 0: Blizzard appears to be trying to give them a path to migrate their characters to non-Chinese servers, so the characters will continue to exist, but it's not clear if the players could play them, and this is sort of an ongoing story, where we're not really sure where it's going to go.

365
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,629
Speaker 0: There was an update right before Geek Nights that I haven't fully read yet.

366
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:40,350
Speaker 1: See, what I don't understand is that, you know, China's... It's like, they have these, you know, undersea cables connecting them to the actual internet, right?

367
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:42,049
Speaker 1: And then they have the Great Firewall, whatever.

368
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:54,530
Speaker 1: You know what you could do, that would save you a lot of money and a lot of work on this Great Firewall, is, you don't want to cut the undersea cables, because obviously your industrial sector still needs access to the real internet, right?

369
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:01,250
Speaker 1: So, what you would do is you just set up internet service providers that have, you know, the real internet for business, right?

370
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:14,970
Speaker 1: And you could maybe keep your Great Firewall on that, or, you know, for each individual business that signs up, you sort of do a reverse firewall, where it's like, "Okay, your business needs this real internet thing.

371
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:17,248
Speaker 1: That's the only thing we're going to let you have access

372
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:17,349
Speaker 1: to.".

373
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,190
Speaker 0: Notching it into the details, but that is, to a large degree, how a lot of this works.

374
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:28,970
Speaker 0: There are just places, pops, data centers, and industries that just have access to the real internet.

375
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,299
Speaker 1: All over the regions of China.

376
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,950
Speaker 1: The blocking aspect, right, is you would set, you would go to, let's say, a factory.

377
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,970
Speaker 0: Oh, if you're in those zones, like, you just have the full internet.

378
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,350
Speaker 0: It doesn't even go through the firewall.

379
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:52,870
Speaker 1: Right, but what I'm saying is what they could, if they really wanted to crack down, right, they could go to each business, figure out what internet, real internet, that business needs, and limit their internet to just that at the ISP level.

380
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:58,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, because then it's just TLS, so they'll have to man in the middle of it to make sure they can actually look at the content.

381
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,090
Speaker 0: The content is more what they care about than the services.

382
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:00,949
Speaker 1: You don't have to look at the content.

383
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,607
Speaker 1: You could be like, "Oh, your business needs, like, this one

384
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:05,170
Speaker 1: website.".

385
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:17,029
Speaker 1: It's like, right, well, any traffic-- No, historically, what they really do is just arbitrarily block things and just-- But that would not serve any purpose for them.

386
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,950
Speaker 0: That reduces the control they have.

387
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:26,850
Speaker 0: By being arbitrary and making it hard, it forces businesses to look inward wherever possible, which is probably part of a long-term strategy.

388
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:41,010
Speaker 1: The point is, what they could then do is for any ISP that's serving not a business that has a reason to access the real internet, like, there just is no physical path to the real internet.

389
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:43,990
Speaker 1: Those ISPs would be entirely internal to the country.

390
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:51,530
Speaker 1: You don't need to great firewall the individuals because there is no router that will route them to the US, like, period.

391
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:56,830
Speaker 0: The great firewall is a little more complex than you're sort of making it out to be.

392
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:06,470
Speaker 1: No, what I'm saying is, like, that's what, like, you won't need the great firewall if you do what I say of just don't-- people who live at home can't access the United States, period.

393
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,910
Speaker 0: That is largely how the great firewall operates in practice.

394
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:15,710
Speaker 1: Pretty sure it looks at, like, all the actual, like, it's, like, it looks at all the, you know, the content.

395
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,076
Speaker 0: It's not just the content.

396
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,610
Speaker 0: They also block entire routes, entire networks.

397
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:22,289
Speaker 0: There's a lot of the physical routing.

398
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,590
Speaker 1: But you won't need to block anything if there is no route at all.

399
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,429
Speaker 1: If there just is no wire connecting to the real internet from someone's house.

400
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:37,060
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

401
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:43,160
Speaker 0: So, you know, lately, if you use TikTok or, like, you look at Google Shorts, there's a particular format of video.

402
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:44,920
Speaker 0: They're, like, 30 seconds long.

403
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:51,400
Speaker 0: And they're, like, this very specific kind of life hack that are often extremely simplistic.

404
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:53,510
Speaker 0: Half the time, they're just wrong.

405
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:54,820
Speaker 0: But they're out there.

406
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,148
Speaker 1: A lot of the time, they're lies.

407
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:57,920
Speaker 1: I think a lot of them are lies on purpose.

408
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,417
Speaker 1: To be funny or impressive or to trick people or, you know, just to get clicks.

409
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,528
Speaker 0: Some of them are seeking clicks.

410
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:06,800
Speaker 0: Some of them are seeking ad revenue.

411
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,632
Speaker 0: Some of them are parodies.

412
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:09,599
Speaker 0: Some of them are just--.

413
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,400
Speaker 1: They've been around for, they've been around for a long time.

414
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,180
Speaker 1: I think as long as, like, Instagram Stories, I think that's when they really started.

415
00:29:15,981 --> 00:29:20,080
Speaker 0: But they've sort of settled over the last several years into a particular format.

416
00:29:20,603 --> 00:29:23,480
Speaker 0: To the point that they all kind of follow the exact same pattern.

417
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,400
Speaker 0: So my Thing of the Day is I just encountered a 30-second short on YouTube.

418
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:36,620
Speaker 0: That is a very apt, straight-faced parody of these together about how to remove potatoes from your knives.

419
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:39,040
Speaker 0: And it is expertly done and hilarious.

420
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:42,560
Speaker 0: And if you watch this, you never need to watch any other parody of these things.

421
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,139
Speaker 0: And probably you don't need to watch these things.

422
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,739
Speaker 0: Because most of them, at best, will not work and more likely might hurt you.

423
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,720
Speaker 0: But if your potato is stuck on your knife and the shoes aren't doing it, this is how you get a potato off a knife.

424
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,165
Speaker 0: So yeah.

425
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,430
Speaker 1: So usually, if you want to attend, you know, a fancy business conference, right?

426
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,787
Speaker 1: You got to travel and/or pay a bunch of money, right?

427
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,309
Speaker 1: And even if they put their shit online, it costs money, right?

428
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:13,430
Speaker 1: It's like usually only for the people who bought real tickets can access the whatever, right?

429
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:15,689
Speaker 1: If there's a live stream, you got to pay for that.

430
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:20,690
Speaker 1: And usually people pay the large amount of money because, you know, the company pays for it.

431
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,650
Speaker 1: Not the person, right?

432
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:30,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a reason nerd conventions cost like 100 bucks for a badge, but like an industry conference is like $5,000.

433
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,365
Speaker 1: But the space is the same, right?

434
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:43,210
Speaker 1: So anyway, the Seattle Kraken, the newest NHL hockey team, had a conference called C-Hack, the Seattle Hockey Analytics Conference.

435
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:47,470
Speaker 1: And they held it like, you know, in their arena, right?

436
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:54,810
Speaker 1: And they had all kinds of basically people from all across the ice hockey analytics world, right?

437
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,587
Speaker 1: Students, researchers, industry people, right?

438
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,490
Speaker 1: People who work for teams, teams other than Seattle, right?

439
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:09,350
Speaker 1: You know, the GM, I think, of the Seattle Kraken, all kinds of people, right, talking at this conference.

440
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,689
Speaker 1: It was like eight hours long, like a real, a whole day deal.

441
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:21,670
Speaker 1: And they just put that shit, it was live on YouTube, just for free for anybody on the official Seattle Kraken YouTube channel.

442
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:30,150
Speaker 1: Not on some special conference one, not, you know, and the live stream video is just still there, just recorded.

443
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,949
Speaker 1: You can still watch it on YouTube.

444
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:33,529
Speaker 1: It didn't go anywhere.

445
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:42,470
Speaker 1: So, you know, even if you're not interested in ice hockey or, you know, it's like, you know, there's so many components here, right?

446
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,890
Speaker 1: The computer aspect, right?

447
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,309
Speaker 1: The hockey aspect, the analytics aspect, the math aspect, so much going on.

448
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:52,030
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people who might be interested.

449
00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:56,990
Speaker 1: I watched some of the talks there and I learned quite a bit from quite a few of them.

450
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,468
Speaker 1: And yeah, it's just there for free.

451
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:03,360
Speaker 1: And it's unusual and good.

452
00:32:03,661 --> 00:32:05,229
Speaker 1: More people should be doing shit like this.

453
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:12,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, Kraken in general, the hockey team has done a good job of leveraging social media and streaming and things as a new franchise.

454
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:14,379
Speaker 0: And I applaud it.

455
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:15,226
Speaker 0: Like, what else can you say?

456
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:15,710
Speaker 0: This is cool.

457
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:23,570
Speaker 0: So, the thing is that there are conferences that are really big that, despite having tons of attendees, also have huge ticket prices.

458
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:25,790
Speaker 0: I used to go to trade tech every year in Paris.

459
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,229
Speaker 0: Like, that's why I used to go to Paris.

460
00:32:27,672 --> 00:32:31,550
Speaker 0: So, for some perspective, it's like a three-day conference, so comparable to a PAX.

461
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:33,904
Speaker 0: The turnstile attendance is 1.2 million.

462
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:38,163
Speaker 0: And the cheapest regular badge is 4,300 euros.

463
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:42,490
Speaker 0: And that only gets you onto the main show floor.

464
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,409
Speaker 0: That'd be like an expo hall only pass.

465
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:50,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would never, ever go to trade tech on my own dime.

466
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:52,870
Speaker 0: But if a company's paying for it, maybe I'll go next year.

467
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:59,150
Speaker 1: It's like GDC costs an arm and a leg unless you get some sort of, you know, in or dollars or whatever.

468
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,649
Speaker 0: GDC I might actually just pay for.

469
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:01,652
Speaker 1: Right.

470
00:33:01,974 --> 00:33:03,770
Speaker 1: But, I mean, it's still expensive, right?

471
00:33:04,352 --> 00:33:06,909
Speaker 1: And the quality of the content is very good.

472
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:09,776
Speaker 1: And they were lucky.

473
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:16,050
Speaker 1: They released some of the talks for free over a long period of time, right?

474
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:19,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've also got that package where you can basically buy access to those archives.

475
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:22,250
Speaker 0: And it's honestly a pretty good deal if you need that content.

476
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:25,389
Speaker 1: I mean, the quality of the content is astronomical.

477
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,782
Speaker 0: Like DEFCON, I don't ever need to actually go to DEFCON.

478
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:29,270
Speaker 0: I can watch all the panels from DEFCON.

479
00:33:29,351 --> 00:33:30,648
Speaker 0: That's the only reason I'd be there.

480
00:33:31,954 --> 00:33:32,116
Speaker 1: Yep.

481
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:33,190
Speaker 1: Anyway.

482
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,010
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, Alif the Unseen.

483
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,461
Speaker 1: I'm making a good progress.

484
00:33:40,522 --> 00:33:41,407
Speaker 1: I think I'm like 30% done here.

485
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,210
Speaker 0: I imagine we'll do this show before the end of January or like early February at the latest.

486
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:50,250
Speaker 0: I expect a lot of rapid reading during the holiday times.

487
00:33:51,832 --> 00:33:52,899
Speaker 1: I'm rapid reading right now.

488
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,369
Speaker 1: I'm zooming along here.

489
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:57,088
Speaker 1: We'll see what Alif is up to.

490
00:33:57,651 --> 00:33:58,100
Speaker 0: Yeah.

491
00:33:58,141 --> 00:33:58,570
Speaker 0: He's unseen.

492
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,740
Speaker 1: So far, he's very seen.

493
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,045
Speaker 1: So I'm not sure what the unseen part... Everyone can see him.

494
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,619
Speaker 0: Well, do they see...

495
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:10,330
Speaker 1: If he gets the invisible powers at some point, I don't know what the unseen part is.

496
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:17,110
Speaker 0: I'd say right now I'm leaning toward "unseen by whom" is one angle I'm thinking about.

497
00:34:18,396 --> 00:34:21,110
Speaker 0: Who is unaware of what the unseen is up to?

498
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:28,610
Speaker 0: But more importantly, I'm also thinking about are there aspects that are not seen that are the real story that are going to come out later?

499
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:34,790
Speaker 0: This feels like a book that has multiple levels of allegory rolled into the title itself.

500
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,909
Speaker 0: Never mind the plot.

501
00:34:37,954 --> 00:34:39,208
Speaker 0: This is going to be a good one to talk about.

502
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,389
Speaker 1: The main character is named Alif.

503
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:45,288
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we were just AdPax Unplugged.

504
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:48,069
Speaker 0: If you didn't see us there, the room was full.

505
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,442
Speaker 0: A very similar panel we did at PAX Unplugged right before.

506
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:52,929
Speaker 0: COVID is already on YouTube.

507
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,889
Speaker 0: I posted the slides that were updated from the new one.

508
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:56,775
Speaker 0: You can just go see them.

509
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,670
Speaker 0: They're just online forever.

510
00:34:59,192 --> 00:35:01,949
Speaker 0: If you didn't fill out the PAX feedback form, please do so.

511
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,869
Speaker 0: PAX was really bugging people to do it.

512
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:09,050
Speaker 0: They did tell me that apparently people who went to our panel were filling it out in high numbers.

513
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:09,688
Speaker 0: So good job.

514
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:13,189
Speaker 0: We will very likely do a panel or two at PAX East.

515
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:16,450
Speaker 0: We'll very unlikely be at PAX East for all four days.

516
00:35:16,955 --> 00:35:18,069
Speaker 0: I just don't see that happening.

517
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:28,670
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we'll probably not do a ton of shows in the coming weeks because this is the time when disruptions happen and geek nights will resume like normal at some point in January.

518
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:31,850
Speaker 0: I don't know what else we need to cover right now in the meta moment.

519
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,430
Speaker 0: Follow me on Mastodon because I ain't using Twitter anymore.

520
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:40,410
Speaker 1: I'm still setting up a new internet regime and I'm in no particular hurry because... I

521
00:35:42,015 --> 00:36:05,950
Speaker 0: did see really specifically in the last 48 hours I personally hit a critical mass on Mastodon where suddenly dozens of people all followed me just over the last two days with clearly new accounts and for the first time this morning I looked at my Mastodon feed like the actual feed of people I follow and there was a reasonable amount of content in there.

522
00:36:06,392 --> 00:36:07,256
Speaker 0: There's people posting.

523
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:07,858
Speaker 0: It's not just.

524
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:10,450
Speaker 0: everyone has the new account and no one's using it yet.

525
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:11,948
Speaker 0: So we'll see how this goes.

526
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:20,563
Speaker 1: The approach I think I'm going to take is I'm going to set up... We already talked about this on a Monday show but I'm going to talk about my publishing.

527
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:25,550
Speaker 1: It has nothing to do with anybody else but me.

528
00:36:25,971 --> 00:36:30,420
Speaker 1: I publish what I want in a way that I want and it has nothing to do with anyone else.

529
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,110
Speaker 1: so I'll just decide that independently.

530
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:40,190
Speaker 1: And then in terms of intaking I think what I'm going to do is independent of any services or platforms.

531
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:52,280
Speaker 1: I'm going to write down who and what do I actually need to know about and follow closely and then seek each of those things out individually.

532
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,710
Speaker 0: Funnily enough I made a Google spreadsheet and I've been doing an audit myself.

533
00:36:57,851 --> 00:37:01,730
Speaker 0: I have a list of like 30-ish entities right now where it was like.

534
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:04,530
Speaker 0: this is a thing I actually read every day and care about.

535
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:06,430
Speaker 0: And I haven't decided what to do with that yet.

536
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,032
Speaker 1: It matters to my life.

537
00:37:07,173 --> 00:37:11,470
Speaker 1: It's a person I'm close to or a topic that is real important.

538
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:18,589
Speaker 0: Right now my list is like a handful of feeds, a few specific journalists, like Pope Hat is something that's on that list.

539
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:20,350
Speaker 1: Anyway.

540
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,819
Speaker 0: I'm not listing YouTube channels.

541
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,440
Speaker 0: YouTube's not going anywhere anytime soon but nothing lasts forever.

542
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,410
Speaker 0: Do not trust that YouTube will continue to exist.

543
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:28,865
Speaker 1: Alright, so.

544
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,772
Speaker 0: Teams!

545
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:30,599
Speaker 0: Teams!

546
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,030
Speaker 0: Playing games with teams!

547
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:45,690
Speaker 0: A generic broad topic that is often a launching point into future shows and maybe panels but it's something we've never actually talked about as a topic on Geek Nights except in the context of other conversations.

548
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,709
Speaker 0: And we both realize there's a lot to talk about here.

549
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:53,187
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the fundamental thing is a team is, right?

550
00:37:54,110 --> 00:38:00,130
Speaker 1: When you combine multiple humans into a single player in the context of a game, right?

551
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,950
Speaker 1: You have a game, maybe it's a three-player game but you got nine people.

552
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:07,810
Speaker 1: so you have three teams of three, right?

553
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:19,190
Speaker 1: Most often a team game is gonna be two teams because, you know, any sport, any game of any kind that has more than two, you know, participants, players.

554
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,950
Speaker 0: Two participating entities with agency.

555
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is not a pure race, like a hundred meter dash or something like that.

556
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:29,970
Speaker 0: Meaning completely non-interactive.

557
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:31,870
Speaker 1: It's going to be political.

558
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:38,390
Speaker 0: Oh my god, imagine American football if somehow there were three teams and they were just all fighting over touchdowns.

559
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,370
Speaker 1: Right, it's like, it becomes a political game.

560
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,970
Speaker 1: So you want to remove politics to become a test of skill, right?

561
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:51,270
Speaker 1: And you're not a pure race because there's some interaction that's going on between the two parties involved.

562
00:38:51,992 --> 00:38:55,790
Speaker 1: So, but you don't want to just only have two literal human beings.

563
00:38:56,352 --> 00:39:00,790
Speaker 1: So you form two teams of human beings and there you go, right?

564
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,627
Speaker 1: Problem solved.

565
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:05,070
Speaker 1: Because like one-on-one-- And that's the most common implementation of teams.

566
00:39:05,331 --> 00:39:15,390
Speaker 0: Like one-on-one basketball, one-on-one hockey, those are fine fun things to watch and find fun things to play, but a lot of aspects of those games can't exist.

567
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,007
Speaker 0: There's nobody to pass to.

568
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:20,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's just, there's no passing.

569
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,450
Speaker 1: It's like you lost the whole aspect of the game.

570
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:25,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, like imagine, imagine a one-on-one counter-strike.

571
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:30,010
Speaker 0: It is literally just hide and seek and then who can click on the other person's head first.

572
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,738
Speaker 0: That's the whole game.

573
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,588
Speaker 0: Nothing else matters.

574
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:34,129
Speaker 0: Which actually would be kind of fun.

575
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:39,790
Speaker 0: Also, total aside, I just imagined American football, but there's three teams.

576
00:39:40,131 --> 00:39:43,009
Speaker 0: And when you're on offense, you pick which lane you want to fight in.

577
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:53,310
Speaker 0: Anyway, so as a kid, like as a kid playing team sports and team games, sports are a good angle for this analysis.

578
00:39:53,872 --> 00:39:57,430
Speaker 0: It's interesting because when I was young, there really wasn't real competition.

579
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:06,290
Speaker 0: Like unless you go to a weird school or your parents are a little bit overzealous, you are not, like when you're six, you're not playing a sport competitively.

580
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:16,010
Speaker 0: Like your kid brain probably wants to win, but like there are zero stakes and half the kids probably don't even realize they're playing a sport.

581
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:26,350
Speaker 0: So I remember very distinctively, my school had a thing where at the end of the school year, every year, there was a school-wide tournament across all grades, K through five.

582
00:40:27,072 --> 00:40:34,550
Speaker 0: And the way it worked is every kid was given a color and there were four colors and the entire school was sliced vertically into four teams.

583
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:38,290
Speaker 0: And we had a day long like outdoor Olympics of team sports.

584
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,249
Speaker 0: And within the field day, yep.

585
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:44,470
Speaker 0: And within those team sports, you'd rack up points and one of the colors would win.

586
00:40:45,032 --> 00:40:48,089
Speaker 0: And it was entirely arbitrary and random who won in the end.

587
00:40:48,511 --> 00:41:03,089
Speaker 0: But as a kid, I was oddly invested in making my team win in a way that I would not have cared about were it not for that structure of a team that in my kid brain depended on me to do well.

588
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:04,514
Speaker 1: Yeah.

589
00:41:04,635 --> 00:41:11,510
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, there's a huge psychology, you know, when you're just on your own competing in some sort of game or even just playing and not competing.

590
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:12,132
Speaker 1: Right.

591
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:17,116
Speaker 1: It's like you're just doing whatever for your own reasons, however you like, and you get.

592
00:41:17,156 --> 00:41:20,490
Speaker 1: the result is entirely on you or mostly entirely on you.

593
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,016
Speaker 1: There could be luck or other factors.

594
00:41:22,097 --> 00:41:22,237
Speaker 1: Right.

595
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:25,290
Speaker 1: But, you know, you're not beholden to anyone else or anything.

596
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,474
Speaker 1: But once you're on a team.

597
00:41:27,036 --> 00:41:27,317
Speaker 1: Right.

598
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:30,789
Speaker 1: It's like, well, now there's people that are like depending on you.

599
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:31,552
Speaker 1: Right.

600
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:31,933
Speaker 1: It's like.

601
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:37,430
Speaker 1: their result depends on what you do and your result depends on what they do to some extent.

602
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:42,050
Speaker 1: And you'd like you have this now positive like relationship with these other people.

603
00:41:42,511 --> 00:41:43,293
Speaker 1: You want to help.

604
00:41:43,373 --> 00:41:44,858
Speaker 1: you want to help each other out.

605
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:45,139
Speaker 1: Right.

606
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:48,570
Speaker 1: It's like there's no helping in a game when there's no teams.

607
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:49,031
Speaker 1: Right.

608
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:54,310
Speaker 1: It's like there's only hurt, you know, hurting and conquering and defeating as soon as you have teams.

609
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:59,090
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, you still have the conquering and the beating of the other, you know, your opponents.

610
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:07,690
Speaker 1: But you now have brought in the positive emotion of there are other human beings who you are helping, supporting, boosting.

611
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:08,471
Speaker 1: Right.

612
00:42:08,772 --> 00:42:11,260
Speaker 1: Which does not exist in a non team sport.

613
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,530
Speaker 1: I'll go play non doubles if you go play singles tennis.

614
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:15,512
Speaker 1: Right.

615
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:20,750
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, no, no one's boosting you except that you're maybe a fan or something.

616
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:27,730
Speaker 0: But but another aspect of that field day type competition or kid teams is that they're usually formed randomly.

617
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:35,010
Speaker 0: So as a result, a randomly formed team is a very different situation from an actively formed team.

618
00:42:35,412 --> 00:42:39,350
Speaker 0: And that is a that is a topic that could probably be an entire goddamn lecture series.

619
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:45,950
Speaker 1: I was going to say formation of teams could probably be, you know, the different ways to form a team and what that means.

620
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:47,890
Speaker 1: But it's like that could be a whole episode.

621
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:58,390
Speaker 0: I remember on the as a kid, you know, you go to gym class in elementary school and a lot of times the way a team is formed is the teacher just randomly splits kids up because they don't want to deal with drama.

622
00:42:58,752 --> 00:42:59,858
Speaker 0: But then you're on the playground.

623
00:42:59,898 --> 00:43:01,970
Speaker 1: Take the two kids who are the best at the sport.

624
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,154
Speaker 1: Everyone knows who they are.

625
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:05,243
Speaker 1: And they take turns picking kids.

626
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:06,930
Speaker 1: And then the kids who are the worst feel bad.

627
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,416
Speaker 1: They get picked last.

628
00:43:08,436 --> 00:43:11,410
Speaker 0: That is how it often went on the playground when the teachers weren't around.

629
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:13,515
Speaker 1: I mean, we had.

630
00:43:13,796 --> 00:43:17,070
Speaker 1: I mean, I when I was kid, teachers would tell us to do it that way.

631
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,612
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

632
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,182
Speaker 0: I you know, weirdly, I died after elementary school.

633
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,090
Speaker 0: I never took a gym class in school again.

634
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:24,982
Speaker 0: So I didn't experience that was required.

635
00:43:25,183 --> 00:43:26,689
Speaker 0: Anyway, a band counted as gym.

636
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,762
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is right.

637
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:31,926
Speaker 1: That's one way to choose teams.

638
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:32,890
Speaker 1: But, you know, pro sports.

639
00:43:33,031 --> 00:43:33,151
Speaker 1: Right.

640
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:34,636
Speaker 1: You have a draft and you have.

641
00:43:34,797 --> 00:43:35,821
Speaker 1: you know, it's labor.

642
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:36,182
Speaker 1: Right.

643
00:43:36,222 --> 00:43:38,269
Speaker 1: Choosing the teams is like a labor issue.

644
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,937
Speaker 1: You're hiring and firing people.

645
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:41,425
Speaker 1: You can waive people.

646
00:43:41,505 --> 00:43:42,470
Speaker 1: You can trade people.

647
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:47,968
Speaker 1: You could force someone to go move their life to a different city.

648
00:43:47,988 --> 00:43:48,710
Speaker 1: Right.

649
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:53,490
Speaker 1: Or, you know, loan someone from one soccer team in one country to another.

650
00:43:53,971 --> 00:43:54,212
Speaker 1: Right.

651
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:58,050
Speaker 1: And like upend this person's life and change who they're playing with.

652
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:05,030
Speaker 0: Well, that gets to the point where independent of all that team formation now expands the scope of the game.

653
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:08,139
Speaker 0: The game is not just how did you do in the game?

654
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,770
Speaker 0: The game started when you started forming or messing with the team.

655
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,410
Speaker 0: Just like making a deck and magic is part of the match of magic you play.

656
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:16,390
Speaker 1: Yeah.

657
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,115
Speaker 1: You could be a college coach.

658
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:23,350
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, you can choose any of the eligible players who are students at the school right now.

659
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:25,094
Speaker 1: Choose the best one.

660
00:44:25,134 --> 00:44:25,435
Speaker 1: Right.

661
00:44:25,857 --> 00:44:28,345
Speaker 0: And then you have to think about the goal of the team.

662
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,870
Speaker 0: is the goal of the team.

663
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:37,610
Speaker 0: Like, imagine an intramural or a junior varsity sport or like the gaming club at your school.

664
00:44:38,211 --> 00:44:39,416
Speaker 0: It's not professional.

665
00:44:39,436 --> 00:44:42,950
Speaker 0: It's competitive because you want to have this competitive, fun, test of skill.

666
00:44:43,371 --> 00:44:44,313
Speaker 0: But the stakes are low.

667
00:44:44,854 --> 00:44:51,750
Speaker 0: So as a result, the teams may be formed based on what is the most fun or what helps the members of the team grow the most.

668
00:44:52,331 --> 00:45:05,150
Speaker 0: But a professional sport or a sport or a game where the stakes matter, the formation of the team kind of has to focus on the health of and performance of the team, possibly to the detriment of the members of that team individually.

669
00:45:05,891 --> 00:45:11,830
Speaker 0: It starts to get into a really complex and interesting space when you look at what teams actually mean in the real world.

670
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:14,152
Speaker 1: Yeah.

671
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:21,069
Speaker 1: But yet the way you form the teams can cause a lot of competitive imbalances.

672
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:21,530
Speaker 1: Right.

673
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,582
Speaker 1: All sorts of you know, or it can make a lot of good balances.

674
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:24,823
Speaker 1: Right.

675
00:45:24,864 --> 00:45:26,330
Speaker 1: You form the teams in a good way.

676
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:32,869
Speaker 1: But I think one of the things that's exposed by team formation the most are those imbalances.

677
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:33,130
Speaker 1: Right.

678
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:43,250
Speaker 1: Because, you know, you might have an individual who might be extremely good at something right on a team and the rest of the team isn't good enough.

679
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,638
Speaker 1: And while that person might be like an all star.

680
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:46,602
Speaker 1: Right.

681
00:45:46,963 --> 00:45:49,030
Speaker 1: They never the team never wins.

682
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:50,492
Speaker 1: Right.

683
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,061
Speaker 1: Or you could have someone who sucks ass.

684
00:45:53,302 --> 00:45:55,310
Speaker 1: They're not any good, but they're there.

685
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,507
Speaker 1: You need to fill the roster and not everyone on the team is an all star.

686
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:00,110
Speaker 1: Right.

687
00:46:00,411 --> 00:46:03,358
Speaker 1: So they could play basketball and you have 10 people.

688
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:03,920
Speaker 1: Right.

689
00:46:04,401 --> 00:46:07,810
Speaker 1: And five people warm on the bench and they all suck.

690
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:14,070
Speaker 1: And five people are legendary and they win the championship and they never get injured or tired.

691
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:18,684
Speaker 1: And the five bench warmers sit and don't do a damn thing.

692
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:20,390
Speaker 1: And then our NBA champions.

693
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:22,697
Speaker 1: It's like it happens.

694
00:46:22,777 --> 00:46:26,310
Speaker 1: There are people who are NBA champions who haven't really did not.

695
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:33,390
Speaker 1: Well, I literally if I had been paid to sit in their seat, I would be an NBA champion.

696
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:34,312
Speaker 1: Right.

697
00:46:34,412 --> 00:46:39,490
Speaker 1: Because the five people who did most of the playing right were, you know, carried everything.

698
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,303
Speaker 1: It's like and that's, you know, is that fair?

699
00:46:43,624 --> 00:46:44,106
Speaker 1: Is that right?

700
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:45,110
Speaker 1: Is a lot of questions.

701
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:47,399
Speaker 1: But it's like we just sort of look at.

702
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:48,584
Speaker 0: look at online video games.

703
00:46:48,664 --> 00:46:50,130
Speaker 0: like I play a lot of team Fortnite.

704
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:51,515
Speaker 0: I play a lot of team Overwatch.

705
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:54,710
Speaker 0: Most of my Overwatch playing these days is with randos.

706
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,877
Speaker 0: It's me and five other random team.

707
00:46:56,977 --> 00:46:57,198
Speaker 1: Yep.

708
00:46:57,378 --> 00:47:01,170
Speaker 0: So winning or losing, like I'll play my best and I'll try hard.

709
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,964
Speaker 0: Sometimes the DPS just garbage, like nothing you can do.

710
00:47:04,984 --> 00:47:06,330
Speaker 0: Like you're going to lose them.

711
00:47:07,633 --> 00:47:12,650
Speaker 1: Sometimes people say sometimes people complain that they lost because their team sucks and they're salty.

712
00:47:13,212 --> 00:47:15,523
Speaker 1: And it's like, but sometimes that's true.

713
00:47:15,683 --> 00:47:17,010
Speaker 1: You did lose because your team suck.

714
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,869
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, how can you tell the salt from the truth?

715
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:25,410
Speaker 0: And you know, this is known because if you look at what Overwatch, I know I'm sure other games do this, too.

716
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,497
Speaker 0: But Overwatch does it very directly.

717
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:36,650
Speaker 0: If you come into the matchmaking queue in a group, it tries to match you against teams that have groups of the same size.

718
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:45,810
Speaker 0: So if I have a group of three and they're going to put two randos in my team, it tries to put me against another team that has a group of three and two randos.

719
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:56,469
Speaker 0: Because team cohesion and team structure and the existence of a team versus a team that existed versus a team that was instantiated has a huge impact on how well the game will go.

720
00:47:57,531 --> 00:48:05,110
Speaker 0: Five people who talk a little bit in voice chat are almost definitely going to beat five people who do not talk in voice chat if skill is similar.

721
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:11,570
Speaker 0: I've played on teams over the years, but they're in a lot of different contexts.

722
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:19,899
Speaker 0: I played off and on in Quake 1 days on some CTF teams that would meet and practice and play arranged matches.

723
00:48:19,919 --> 00:48:22,850
Speaker 0: And honestly, it was super fun and I missed that.

724
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,064
Speaker 0: That is a height of game playing that I would seek out if I had more free time.

725
00:48:27,084 --> 00:48:28,530
Speaker 0: A lot more than I do now.

726
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, well there's two other types of teams I want to discuss.

727
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:43,410
Speaker 1: So the first type of team is you see this happen a lot at family board game night where it's like, you know, the game doesn't support enough players and it's like, oh, we'll be on a team, right?

728
00:48:44,032 --> 00:48:45,330
Speaker 1: Or, you know, you play...

729
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:49,510
Speaker 0: That's code four, alright little buddy, we can pretend that you're participating most of the time.

730
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:53,941
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you have a co-op game, right?

731
00:48:53,961 --> 00:48:56,670
Speaker 1: And presumably you're playing Hanabi, right?

732
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:02,708
Speaker 1: But I guess Hanabi is a real team game, but Pandemic kind of mostly isn't, right?

733
00:49:02,828 --> 00:49:03,149
Speaker 1: Sort of.

734
00:49:04,493 --> 00:49:07,140
Speaker 1: And it ends up being a situation where... It's PVE.

735
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:07,948
Speaker 0: It's Team PVE.

736
00:49:09,675 --> 00:49:09,976
Speaker 1: Right.

737
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,810
Speaker 1: What's actually happening is you're playing Solitaire, right?

738
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:19,170
Speaker 1: And even though you have a team, not everyone is contributing, right?

739
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,997
Speaker 1: If you play soccer, right?

740
00:49:22,118 --> 00:49:23,542
Speaker 1: You have 11 people out there.

741
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:26,690
Speaker 1: Someone might just stand still and not do anything.

742
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,418
Speaker 1: I guess that's possible, right?

743
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,750
Speaker 1: But the point is everyone is contributing.

744
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:34,090
Speaker 1: If someone just stood there, that would detriment your whole team, right?

745
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:40,290
Speaker 1: In order to win, you need all of the 11 people to contribute the effort, right?

746
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:43,788
Speaker 1: One person can't do it all alone against 11, right?

747
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:48,348
Speaker 1: Assuming it's not like a superstar against children or something like that, right?

748
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:48,890
Speaker 1: That doesn't count.

749
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,150
Speaker 0: Now imagine a board game, like chess as an example.

750
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:56,030
Speaker 0: If you and I are playing chess and I just said, hey, Joey Jojo, be on my team, we'll play together.

751
00:49:56,611 --> 00:50:04,430
Speaker 0: Well, now, one of us, either me or Joey Jojo, is better at chess, and that's probably the only person who matters in that game now.

752
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:04,670
Speaker 1: Right.

753
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:11,410
Speaker 1: If me and Rim join, you know, what's the dude's name, Max, whatever, the legendary, the guy who wins all the chess?

754
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:12,601
Speaker 0: Matt Carl...

755
00:50:13,932 --> 00:50:15,027
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever, uh...

756
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:16,428
Speaker 0: Magnus Carlsen?

757
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,229
Speaker 1: Yes, not Max, Magnus, yes.

758
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:25,069
Speaker 1: Right, so if me and Rim join Magnus' team, his team is the same as it was before, right?

759
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:31,690
Speaker 1: It's like, we're contributing nothing, absolutely nothing to that team, and we can't contribute anything to that team.

760
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:33,816
Speaker 1: It's basically not a team.

761
00:50:34,218 --> 00:50:38,050
Speaker 1: We'd be lying to yourselves if you said that that was a team, you're an individual.

762
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:44,830
Speaker 1: So that, it's like, that's the same thing as when you're like, okay, we'll be a team and play Monopoly, we'll both be the top hat.

763
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:45,633
Speaker 1: It's like, no, you're not.

764
00:50:46,196 --> 00:50:49,230
Speaker 1: One person knows how to play Monopoly better than the other person.

765
00:50:49,931 --> 00:50:55,303
Speaker 1: If you let a child actually do physically move the hat, it's like, that's nice, right?

766
00:50:55,363 --> 00:50:58,750
Speaker 1: The kid will learn how to count, but the kid is not on the team.

767
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:16,490
Speaker 0: One could argue, in a more complex game that's still structured like that, you could divide up duties that not one player... Imagine a train game where one person calculates and thinks about stock rounds and the other person runs the trains because one of them's good at one and one of them's good at the other.

768
00:51:16,831 --> 00:51:24,170
Speaker 0: I could see some edge cases, but they're so rare and so contrived that I don't think they matter in any real conversation.

769
00:51:24,511 --> 00:51:31,950
Speaker 0: Unless a game is so complex that it's already getting to the point to where multiple people forming a team could do it better objectively.

770
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:38,210
Speaker 0: Like, four people playing American football against three people are probably just gonna do better.

771
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:39,671
Speaker 1: Yep.

772
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:49,485
Speaker 1: So, the other kind of team is basically a team where you're not actually on the team together, right?

773
00:51:49,525 --> 00:51:52,890
Speaker 1: You're just sort of cooperating and working together, right?

774
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:56,998
Speaker 1: So, a good example might be like a boxer, right?

775
00:51:57,138 --> 00:51:59,784
Speaker 1: Boxing is an individual sport, right?

776
00:51:59,924 --> 00:52:00,906
Speaker 1: Or a golf.

777
00:52:00,966 --> 00:52:02,850
Speaker 0: Purely individual sport when you're a golfer.

778
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,035
Speaker 0: By a team of people.

779
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:06,678
Speaker 0: Look at a hockey team!

780
00:52:06,899 --> 00:52:12,150
Speaker 0: The equipment manager, the coach, the assistant coach, the goalie coach, board games.

781
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:18,830
Speaker 0: You could imagine a competitive board game team having the strategy coach separate from the drilling coach.

782
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,374
Speaker 1: Well, but it might not just be the coach.

783
00:52:22,475 --> 00:52:31,170
Speaker 1: It might be that you have a boxing gym or a golfing club and there's the people that you golf with, right?

784
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:36,290
Speaker 1: And even though you're all individually golfing, no one hits your ball for you, right?

785
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:47,010
Speaker 1: But all four of you are driving the golf cart around individually golfing together, talking about golf together, watching each other, giving each other's tips, right?

786
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:50,820
Speaker 1: When it comes time for a golf tournament, you all enter individually.

787
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:54,430
Speaker 1: But you might have some camaraderie with each other, right?

788
00:52:54,510 --> 00:53:00,130
Speaker 1: And be happy if the other people win because those are your people who you golf with.

789
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:05,105
Speaker 0: That is actually specifically the plot of Queen's Gambit, which is a really good show and you'd probably like it.

790
00:53:05,366 --> 00:53:06,750
Speaker 0: It's about board games, basically.

791
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,810
Speaker 1: People who play chess together, but they're individual.

792
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:15,210
Speaker 0: It's about a person who becomes a chess master and joins the world of professional chess.

793
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:26,290
Speaker 0: And I guess low-key spoilers, over the course of it realizes that despite being a genius at chess, she will do better if she talks to other humans about chess instead of just being by herself.

794
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:27,610
Speaker 0: Spoilers.

795
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:28,129
Speaker 0: Don't say.

796
00:53:29,712 --> 00:53:32,530
Speaker 0: Also drug abuse and other things going on, but it's a good show.

797
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:33,280
Speaker 1: Well, don't do that.

798
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:33,689
Speaker 1: That's bad.

799
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:45,450
Speaker 1: But, you know, the point is it's a kind of team, but like the game itself doesn't care about that kind of team, but the humans care about that kind of team a lot, right?

800
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:53,810
Speaker 1: It can make a huge difference from the human perspective to play individual games with some sort of team-like structure.

801
00:53:53,830 --> 00:54:01,750
Speaker 0: Well, also you'll get situations that blend that where you practice and scrimmage as a team or you play games as a team.

802
00:54:02,151 --> 00:54:08,190
Speaker 0: But then when there's a competition, a subset of your team goes to play as a team in the competition.

803
00:54:08,691 --> 00:54:10,033
Speaker 0: In high school, Quiz Bowl was like that.

804
00:54:10,073 --> 00:54:18,770
Speaker 0: We had like 15 people in the varsity team and they would choose usually with an internal tournament within the team that practice together.

805
00:54:19,091 --> 00:54:26,010
Speaker 0: We do many tournaments to decide who represented us on the five person team at the regional tournament.

806
00:54:27,691 --> 00:54:33,150
Speaker 1: This does remind me of a somewhat recent ish thing of the day where there was the the jigsaw puzzle turn.

807
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:41,590
Speaker 1: And you could see that some people went to the jigsaw puzzle tournament as a team, like all wearing the same T-shirts coming from the same country.

808
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:42,311
Speaker 1: Right.

809
00:54:42,752 --> 00:54:45,718
Speaker 1: But there were multiple different rounds and events.

810
00:54:45,778 --> 00:54:52,130
Speaker 1: There were individual events, two player events, two puzzle events, the two people events and a four people event.

811
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:58,670
Speaker 1: And some people teamed up, you know, they formed different teams for those different events, like four people went.

812
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:01,818
Speaker 1: They all competed individually in the individual round.

813
00:55:02,118 --> 00:55:06,410
Speaker 1: They formed two teams of two and in the dual and the doubles round.

814
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:10,359
Speaker 1: And then they they combined for a team of four and the four people round.

815
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:10,599
Speaker 1: Right.

816
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,210
Speaker 1: So they sort of were having every different kind of team.

817
00:55:15,932 --> 00:55:16,133
Speaker 1: Right.

818
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:19,589
Speaker 1: All in one, you know, set of tournaments at one event.

819
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:21,111
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

820
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:30,370
Speaker 0: I got to say in general, because obviously there's a I think we've already come up with like four episodes of Geek Nights and at least one panel out of this conversation so far.

821
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:44,270
Speaker 0: But I got to say, the times I have played on competitive teams in any domain, like, you know, varsity things in high school, the handful of proto esports teams I played on for small amounts of time.

822
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:45,292
Speaker 0: I've loved it.

823
00:55:45,392 --> 00:55:45,893
Speaker 0: It's fun.

824
00:55:46,274 --> 00:55:47,537
Speaker 0: It just takes a lot of investment.

825
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,765
Speaker 0: I feel like I should, you know, fuck it.

826
00:55:50,785 --> 00:55:51,888
Speaker 0: I'm going to form an Overwatch team.

827
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:52,470
Speaker 0: Who's in?

828
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,020
Speaker 0: Geek Nights listener, join me.

829
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:56,890
Speaker 0: We can be bronzed here together.

830
00:55:58,211 --> 00:56:07,069
Speaker 1: I think the biggest problem, the biggest thing that hurts a team is when people on the team aren't aligned in their goals and attitudes.

831
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:12,724
Speaker 0: I mean, it's one thing when in a game that's competitive, not all the players want the same thing.

832
00:56:12,764 --> 00:56:15,030
Speaker 0: Some people are trying hard, some people aren't trying hard.

833
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:26,730
Speaker 0: But if you're on a team and for like an Overwatch team and four of the players practice and try to get better and like show up and play regularly and the fifth player is flaky and doesn't actually care that much if they win.

834
00:56:27,196 --> 00:56:28,028
Speaker 0: That's almost worse.

835
00:56:29,331 --> 00:56:29,451
Speaker 1: Right.

836
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:33,578
Speaker 1: You could imagine a high school sports team, right?

837
00:56:34,118 --> 00:56:41,190
Speaker 1: And one kid is like, he really wants to get noticed by scouts and get like a college scholarship because he's right.

838
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:44,838
Speaker 1: And then another kid is just doing this for fun.

839
00:56:45,078 --> 00:56:45,680
Speaker 1: They don't care.

840
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,845
Speaker 1: Another kid, their parents made him do it.

841
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:50,090
Speaker 1: Another kid, right?

842
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:56,320
Speaker 1: It's like there could be so many different motivations and reasons and attitudes of the different players on the team.

843
00:56:57,001 --> 00:57:02,670
Speaker 1: And if they can't align, there could be lots of drama and it will be a negative team experience.

844
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,406
Speaker 1: This is why I like.

845
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:07,015
Speaker 1: This can happen in professional teams too, right?

846
00:57:07,035 --> 00:57:07,295
Speaker 1: You can have.

847
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:15,430
Speaker 1: one person is an old player who's retiring and just wants to finish out their contract right year, you know, and then retire.

848
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:17,394
Speaker 1: And then they just want to not get hurt.

849
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:19,258
Speaker 1: Another player is a young player.

850
00:57:19,298 --> 00:57:21,142
Speaker 1: They want to, you know, they're.

851
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:24,530
Speaker 1: another player is a, uh, they're in their free agent year.

852
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,553
Speaker 1: They're playing really hard.

853
00:57:26,593 --> 00:57:29,762
Speaker 1: They want to get a, you know, get a big deal next year to get paid.

854
00:57:30,223 --> 00:57:31,888
Speaker 1: Another person just got their contract.

855
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:32,610
Speaker 1: They're getting paid.

856
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:36,143
Speaker 1: They don't give a shit anymore because they don't actually, for some reason they're not competitive.

857
00:57:36,163 --> 00:57:36,966
Speaker 1: They don't care about winning.

858
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:37,770
Speaker 1: They just care about money.

859
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:40,274
Speaker 1: Someone else actually does care about winning.

860
00:57:40,314 --> 00:57:42,857
Speaker 1: They want to win, but the team doesn't care about winning.

861
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:45,882
Speaker 1: They just care about, there could be conflicts there as well.

862
00:57:45,942 --> 00:57:51,350
Speaker 1: Just because it's a professional type organization doesn't mean everyone's going to be in alignment.

863
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,893
Speaker 0: And in gaming, like this is something I really applaud.

864
00:57:53,913 --> 00:57:56,657
Speaker 0: And we've seen this in a lot of online video games already.

865
00:57:57,238 --> 00:58:05,130
Speaker 0: They're starting, they increasingly sort players by what they want out of the game or what they're trying to do rather than just sorting them based on skill.

866
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:13,645
Speaker 0: Like the difference between like, instead of calling it competitive and casual, you have, you have to click, I'm a tryhard versus I just want to have fun.

867
00:58:14,206 --> 00:58:16,170
Speaker 0: And you play with different groups of people.

868
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:23,268
Speaker 0: At least the people who say they want to be tryhards will be grouped together separately from the people who say they don't want to try that hard.

869
00:58:23,288 --> 00:58:24,030
Speaker 0: They want to have fun.

870
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:28,517
Speaker 0: Now, self-reporting, obviously this isn't perfect, but we're seeing this more and more.

871
00:58:29,018 --> 00:58:30,641
Speaker 0: Fortnite does this very well.

872
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:36,110
Speaker 0: All the different modes in Fortnite have very clearly different motivations for the players.

873
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:43,510
Speaker 0: And it keeps teams from forming among randos who are going to do radically different things in the course of the game to their team's detriment.

874
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,835
Speaker 1: So yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on with teams.

875
00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:58,887
Speaker 1: You could probably have a whole, you know, not just, you know, several panels, but like a whole podcast that's like team dynamics, the pod.

876
00:58:58,927 --> 00:59:01,210
Speaker 1: I bet there's people who probably just study this as their whole life.

877
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:04,113
Speaker 1: There's experts on teams, right?

878
00:59:04,133 --> 00:59:12,624
Speaker 1: Not just, you know, game teams, like teams at work, jobs, and, you know, just human cooperation just as a subject matter, right?

879
00:59:13,525 --> 00:59:17,670
Speaker 1: So, it's particularly noteworthy for games.

880
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,526
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

881
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:30,560

890
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,602
Speaker 0: Holidays are coming up.

891
01:00:15,963 --> 01:00:20,692
Speaker 0: As you know, Geek Nights goes on unexpected hiatus pretty regularly this time of year.

892
01:00:20,712 --> 01:00:22,035
Speaker 0: But I don't have any work.

893
01:00:22,075 --> 01:00:24,480
Speaker 0: travel until January, February.

894
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,183
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

895
01:00:26,203 --> 01:00:27,790
Speaker 0: We'll probably do a show on Thursday.

896
01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:30,120
Speaker 0: I expect we'll do shows next week and we'll see what happens.

897
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,836
Speaker 0: But for now, join my Overwatch team and I simply leave you with...

898
01:00:36,281 --> 01:00:39,760
Speaker 1: Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for the richest man in the world.

899
01:01:08,483 --> 01:01:09,856
Speaker 0: Cheers and boos, I say.

900
01:01:31,673 --> 01:01:33,188
Speaker 0: Smithers, are they booing?

901
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:36,583
Speaker 0: No, they're saying boo-erns.

902
01:01:36,804 --> 01:01:37,789
Speaker 1: Boo-erns.

903
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:41,049
Speaker 0: Are you saying boo or boo-erns?

904
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:45,689
Speaker 1: I was saying boo-erns.
