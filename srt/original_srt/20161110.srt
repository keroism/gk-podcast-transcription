1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,780
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, November 10th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,161
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,328
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,178
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,909
Speaker 0: Somehow we never did a show on this.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,169
Speaker 0: Talking about wallets.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,387
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:31,650
Speaker 0: So over the weekend, Scott, uh, uh, Gold me into doing this thing and I did it.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,704
Speaker 1: I didn't goad you into doing it.

10
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:33,029
Speaker 1: You agreed.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,970
Speaker 1: Well, you told me it was- I told you it existed.

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:35,999
Speaker 0: You told me it existed.

13
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:42,410
Speaker 0: You expressed- I actually- You expressed mild, uh, suspicion that I would wake up early enough to do it.

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:42,611
Speaker 0: Right.

15
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:48,569
Speaker 1: I anti-goaded you by telling you you'd have to wake up at not the crack-ass of dawn, but the crack-ass of dawn.

16
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,248
Speaker 1: Crack-a-crackity-crack.

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,310
Speaker 0: Like, I got up at- when did I leave the house?

18
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,431
Speaker 1: I woke up at like 4.30, 4.45.

19
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:56,552
Speaker 1: Okay.

20
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:58,090
Speaker 0: I don't think I actually left.

21
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,170
Speaker 1: I left at like 5.15, 5.30.

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,870
Speaker 0: 'Cause it took- it didn't take me that long to bike down there to the starting point.

23
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,209
Speaker 1: Well, I'm farther away than you.

24
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:06,754
Speaker 0: You are.

25
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:08,289
Speaker 0: Also, I bike a lot faster.

26
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,929
Speaker 1: You're trying to bike faster.

27
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,730
Speaker 0: Though, yo, I noticed that, 'cause usually when I bike with you, like, no, you're not slow, but you're not fast.

28
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:16,629
Speaker 0: I could go faster.

29
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,332
Speaker 0: But then you bike.

30
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:20,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, what I'm saying, when we started biking, I went at the usual speed.

31
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:22,009
Speaker 0: I think I'll go when I'm with you.

32
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,649
Speaker 0: And then you were like, whoosh, 'cause you have that good bike now.

33
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:25,970
Speaker 0: You are going faster.

34
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,290
Speaker 1: I'm not tr- I just- whenever I bike, I just go- I'm not in a race.

35
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,710
Speaker 0: You're not huffing and puffing like I am.

36
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're huffing and puffing and I'm just sorta like, doo-doo-doo-doo.

37
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:36,023
Speaker 0: No, I was- I was legit impressed with your speed.

38
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:41,408
Speaker 1: That is- that bike- I mean, oh, yes, I'm so impressed with your speed in that F1 car.

39
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:48,509
Speaker 0: It almost makes me want to get another bike, 'cause I got a hybrid, which doesn't have- it's not like that.

40
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:56,770
Speaker 1: Especially 'cause also I was recently mountain biking, so- I didn't buy the- like, when I bought the bike, the guy at the bike store was like, you know, fancy bike doesn't make you go faster.

41
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,000
Speaker 1: I'm like, I know, I'm not buying it to go faster.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,250
Speaker 1: I'm buying it because, you know, it's more comfortable.

43
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:05,310
Speaker 0: Well, who's the kid in the forum who was like, I'm too slow going up hills, what bike should I buy?

44
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,908
Speaker 0: And we were like, ahhh.

45
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:10,566
Speaker 1: No matter what bike you buy, the engine is the same.

46
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:11,130
Speaker 1: Your leg.

47
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,058
Speaker 1: But, yeah, it's just more comfortable, right?

48
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:17,470
Speaker 1: It's like, if I had to do that ride on my other bike, my ass would hurt.

49
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,330
Speaker 1: So, but on this bike, I could just sit on it all goddamn day.

50
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:24,090
Speaker 0: Ah, thing is, I wear the, uh, fancy pants.

51
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,688
Speaker 1: I also got the fancy pants, but even using the fancy pants- Not fancy enough.

52
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:30,569
Speaker 1: Really not fancy enough.

53
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:37,249
Speaker 0: My pants are pretty- actually, some of my pants are fancy, but most of my bike shorts are bullshit Chinese bootlegs.

54
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,270
Speaker 1: I bought the- this is one brand on Amazon, and it fit, so I got that brand.

55
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:50,410
Speaker 0: I have two for-real ones that I wear under other shorts, and then I have, like, because Emily and I are the same size-ish, so, I bought, like, six pairs of these bootleg fucking bike shorts.

56
00:02:50,550 --> 00:03:01,328
Speaker 1: Basically, what it is, the New York City Marathon happens, right, and it starts in Staten Island, it goes up Brooklyn, Queens, over the bridge, up to the Bronx, down, and then into Central Park, and then in the bottom of Central Park.

57
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:01,850
Speaker 1: in the end, right?

58
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:16,269
Speaker 1: So, we start in Astoria, and we go all the way down to the bottom ass of Brooklyn, we can't go to Staten Island, and then we start, like, way before the race starts, 'cause you can't- otherwise, it's like one of those video games where the spike wall is going from the left side of the screen.

59
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:16,663
Speaker 1: Yeah.

60
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:20,890
Speaker 1: Right, all the runners, and also the police would kick you off the road at a certain point.

61
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'd probably taze you off the road at that point.

62
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:31,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to get to the end, you have to start way before the runners start, and get to the end before the cops close the road, and there's still technically cars on the road, is that closed?

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,810
Speaker 0: Yep, but there's way less cars?

64
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,830
Speaker 1: There's almost no cars, because there's all these people setting up all the water tables, and the clocks, and all the marathon shit.

65
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,950
Speaker 0: So, you gotta kind of avoid all that shit, too, like in the Pulaski, they had that giant timer, and you couldn't get on the regular road yet, and there's all that-.

66
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,290
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but I mean, you know, it was like, you get the idea, right?

67
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,716
Speaker 1: It's like, it's a mostly closed road, right?

68
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:59,570
Speaker 1: You can pedal for a long ass time without having to stop, it's pretty nice, you don't have to pay to enter into some race or anything, or win a lottery, or get a bib, or any of that nonsense, you know?

69
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,370
Speaker 1: And then, so you go up, and I cross over the Queensborough Bridge, and you can cross over the not pedestrian bike park.

70
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,868
Speaker 0: Yep, which I've only done once.

71
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:15,150
Speaker 0: I did it two times, and that was nice, and then you go- That was the point where I bailed, because I didn't suspect I'd easily be able to get back home without taking my bike on the subway.

72
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:19,125
Speaker 0: So, yeah, so then- I was in front of my apartment, it was real tempting, you'd be like, "I'll just go

73
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:19,509
Speaker 0: inside.".

74
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:28,650
Speaker 1: So then I go to the Bronx, and then I go down, right, the east side of the park, and then over to 59th street, and you can't go to the finish line, it's closed off.

75
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,366
Speaker 0: So you just- Yep, the reddit was like, "Don't fucking go, like, all the

76
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:32,628
Speaker 0: way!".

77
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,329
Speaker 1: Right, so you're at Columbus Circle, and then they're like, "You can't do- that's the end of

78
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:37,510
Speaker 1: you.".

79
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:45,010
Speaker 1: So then I try to go home, and I get back to the bridge, and even the pedestrian part of the bridge is, like, closed.

80
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:48,649
Speaker 1: And I ask the cops, I'm like, "Oh, can I just go over this fence and go

81
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:48,870
Speaker 1: home?".

82
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:49,240
Speaker 1: And they're like,

83
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:49,508
Speaker 1: "No.".

84
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:50,039
Speaker 1: And I'm like,

85
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:50,550
Speaker 1: "Really?".

86
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:53,390
Speaker 1: They're running over that part, I'm on this part.

87
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,150
Speaker 0: They close it there every year for security reasons.

88
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,144
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "The runners aren't gonna be here for, like, 45 minutes to an hour, right?

89
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:03,970
Speaker 1: I won't even see the first place person.

90
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,208
Speaker 1: I'll be over this bridge in, like, two

91
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:06,410
Speaker 1: minutes.".

92
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,309
Speaker 0: You're trying to negotiate with a New York cop.

93
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:12,308
Speaker 1: I tried to negotiate with two different cops to let me over.

94
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:16,850
Speaker 1: One was on First Avenue, and one was on that bridge.

95
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,043
Speaker 0: You should have tried to legit bribe them.

96
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:20,070
Speaker 0: That would probably have worked.

97
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,290
Speaker 1: And one was on the bridge side.

98
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,723
Speaker 0: You should have been like, "My friend Alexander

99
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:24,226
Speaker 0: Hamilton.".

100
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:28,870
Speaker 1: Anyway, so they didn't let me go over the fence, right?

101
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,610
Speaker 0: I got a whole roll of George Washington.

102
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,869
Speaker 1: So I had to get over this river.

103
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:38,710
Speaker 0: The only way at that point was you could either take the F train, which sucks, or you could take the...

104
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,587
Speaker 1: I could take a train under the river.

105
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:49,290
Speaker 1: Right, so my choices were try to go up the east side path to see if I could get to Randall's Island using that bridge.

106
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,870
Speaker 0: Which you could have, I think.

107
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,569
Speaker 1: I think it would have worked.

108
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,589
Speaker 0: So that's a loop I run on a regular basis.

109
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:01,390
Speaker 0: I run over the Queensborough, up Manhattan, over the Randall's Island bridge, over the RFK, back home through Astoria.

110
00:06:01,532 --> 00:06:03,090
Speaker 1: I think that would have worked, maybe.

111
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,310
Speaker 0: Because the marathon doesn't go over any of that.

112
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,350
Speaker 1: But I ended up just taking the Skycar to Roosevelt Island.

113
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:08,490
Speaker 0: And then that's an easy bike home.

114
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,889
Speaker 1: Using the Roosevelt Island bridge, which totally worked.

115
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:14,470
Speaker 1: And it's free because you just use your metro card to go on the Skycar.

116
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,490
Speaker 1: But when I was on the Skycar, I think I saw people running on that east side path.

117
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:19,769
Speaker 0: Oh, good call then.

118
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,857
Speaker 1: I think it would have worked.

119
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,390
Speaker 1: No, the marathon wasn't running.

120
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,248
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, I thought you were like, "Oh, the marathon wouldn't have

121
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:24,410
Speaker 0: worked.".

122
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:25,950
Speaker 1: No, no, no, just regular people.

123
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,690
Speaker 1: So it was open, is what I'm saying.

124
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:32,790
Speaker 1: The path, I could have used the... Or the other option was pay for a ferry.

125
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,350
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.

126
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,810
Speaker 1: Or go down to use the Williamsburg bridge.

127
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,930
Speaker 1: But if I go over the Williamsburg bridge, what's going to happen on the other side?

128
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,690
Speaker 0: You're going to get the Pulaski area.

129
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,028
Speaker 1: I'm going to go over there and there's going to be a closed road.

130
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:45,310
Speaker 1: And I can't go north.

131
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:52,050
Speaker 0: You would have had to go way out, up, and back over in those weird areas that you occasionally bike into by accident.

132
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:55,030
Speaker 1: So what is even the next bridge?

133
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,290
Speaker 1: If I go north more, what is the next way to cross?

134
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,490
Speaker 1: Like, go to Connecticut and use the Port Jefferson ferry?

135
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,049
Speaker 0: I'll call an Uber and get it to drive you over the... I don't know.

136
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,850
Speaker 1: I guess I could have put my bike in a car.

137
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:09,327
Speaker 1: But no.

138
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,710
Speaker 0: I was next to my apartment.

139
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,870
Speaker 0: And also, I had gotten ahead of, because you got trapped behind that yelling woman.

140
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,870
Speaker 0: And I finally got past her, and I didn't want to get caught by her again.

141
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:22,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were a group of yelling people.

142
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,909
Speaker 0: They were real excited about this.

143
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,429
Speaker 1: They started yelling less later on.

144
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:27,950
Speaker 0: Maybe they ran their voices out.

145
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,229
Speaker 1: They got tired on the Queensborough bridge, I think, and took the yell out of them.

146
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,890
Speaker 0: So I think it's obvious we were kind of stalling, because there's only one news today.

147
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,370
Speaker 0: Possibly the darkest day in modern American history.

148
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:40,249
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's the darkest day.

149
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,009
Speaker 0: It's the most dangerous day.

150
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,738
Speaker 1: It's not.

151
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:43,289
Speaker 1: Well, listen.

152
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,530
Speaker 0: What do you mean by modern history?

153
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:48,830
Speaker 0: The Vietnam War is distant past for most people.

154
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,748
Speaker 1: Here's what I'm saying, right?

155
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:56,670
Speaker 1: We're at a point where people are somewhat legitimately worried about nuclear disaster soon.

156
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,570
Speaker 1: The Cuban Missile Crisis was a thing.

157
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:00,268
Speaker 0: It was.

158
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:02,749
Speaker 1: So we're less than that.

159
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,589
Speaker 0: But at the same time, when that happened, it was two extremely competent national leaders talking on the phone and dealing with it.

160
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:15,930
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, the danger is probably similar, but different.

161
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,009
Speaker 0: But similar actual magnitude in the end.

162
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,012
Speaker 1: I watched Dr.

163
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:24,424
Speaker 1: Strangelove yesterday because, and in Dr.

164
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:36,690
Speaker 1: Strangelove, which is a comedy, the two national leaders, even though one of them is intoxicated, are more competent than many national leaders in the real world.

165
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:45,743
Speaker 0: I mean, we're not going to dwell on it tonight, because I'm pretty sure, as much as all of us have been dealing with this, I don't think you really want to hear yet another podcast.

166
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:47,290
Speaker 0: spend their entire show talking about it.

167
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,609
Speaker 1: It's too soon, and it's not time yet.

168
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:50,427
Speaker 0: But I'll say this.

169
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:54,889
Speaker 0: The mood in New York City was real, real somber.

170
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,770
Speaker 1: Imagine you see someone and they come to work the first day after their dog died.

171
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:04,050
Speaker 1: Or someone in their family died.

172
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,830
Speaker 0: I knew shit was up, because I went to work early.

173
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:19,650
Speaker 1: Imagine if every single person in the city, except for that one guy driving his minivan in Astoria, raving his red hat at the window, and he's lucky that we're in a city and there aren't rocks on the ground.

174
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:28,110
Speaker 1: Pretty much everybody was acting like someone in their family had just died.

175
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,558
Speaker 0: And no one went to work.

176
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,726
Speaker 0: I got a little early.

177
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,850
Speaker 0: It was very, very uncrowded.

178
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:38,330
Speaker 0: I got on the subway, and I sat down on the four train during the commute.

179
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:39,650
Speaker 1: That is insane.

180
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,289
Speaker 1: I could have sat down, but I don't sit down.

181
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,698
Speaker 0: And I think what really struck me was.

182
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:47,970
Speaker 0: I was sitting there, and there was a dude, just another white dude, obviously going to some sort of Wall Street looking job.

183
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,110
Speaker 0: He kind of looked like I do, except he was wearing a suit.

184
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,790
Speaker 0: And he's reading CNN on his tablet, and then he just starts crying.

185
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,686
Speaker 0: He just puts his head down.

186
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,730
Speaker 0: And I saw that playing out all over the place.

187
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,629
Speaker 0: But then I get to work, and no one's there yet, except my boss.

188
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:03,290
Speaker 0: And he's just sitting there staring at his computer.

189
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:08,150
Speaker 0: And basically, it looked like he'd been there a while already, and no one talked.

190
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,210
Speaker 0: Everyone just sat staring at the computers all day doing nothing.

191
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,170
Speaker 0: No one really got any work done.

192
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:18,730
Speaker 1: It was already well known in advance that there was going to be a catered lunch on that day.

193
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,589
Speaker 1: And it was Thanksgiving food.

194
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,743
Speaker 1: We had a turkey leg and yams and stuffing.

195
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:30,870
Speaker 1: And we pretty much sat in the boardroom eating it quietly.

196
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,291
Speaker 0: Yup.

197
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:38,290
Speaker 0: The worst part, well not the worst part, but I remember on the night when it was actually all going down, we were doing our Overwatch thing.

198
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,430
Speaker 0: We didn't really want to sit and just watch the whole stupid election.

199
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,950
Speaker 0: So we were playing Overwatch in a big voice chat on Discord.

200
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:51,887
Speaker 0: And bit by bit, as the news started getting more and more dire, at one point, Scojo was like, "I just can't pay attention to the game.

201
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:52,228
Speaker 0: I gotta

202
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:52,288
Speaker 0: go.".

203
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,770
Speaker 0: And he just left, and then everyone just left.

204
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,249
Speaker 1: I'm surprised he didn't even play the game.

205
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,788
Speaker 0: Well, we were playing the game, and then it started looking dicey.

206
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,730
Speaker 0: And I pretty much spent half the night looking at the internet.

207
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:06,160
Speaker 0: And then I said, "Fuck it.

208
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:06,949
Speaker 0: I can't deal with

209
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:07,070
Speaker 0: this.".

210
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,669
Speaker 0: And I just went to bed.

211
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:09,349
Speaker 1: I went to bed also.

212
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:10,030
Speaker 0: Yup.

213
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,830
Speaker 0: So yeah, we're not going to really dwell on it yet on the show, obviously.

214
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,982
Speaker 0: But Scott's got some ideas.

215
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,010
Speaker 0: I got some ideas.

216
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,729
Speaker 0: And we're not going to take this sitting down.

217
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:23,666
Speaker 1: Like I said, Rin, before the show, right?

218
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:24,488
Speaker 1: Yup.

219
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:27,530
Speaker 1: People are going to yell at me because I was quiet.

220
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,100
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Shut

221
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:29,262
Speaker 1: up.".

222
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,607
Speaker 1: But the fact is, all you assholes, I was wrong about things that everyone else was wrong about, like what the result was going to be.

223
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:39,929
Speaker 1: But I was right that you were just tweeting in the wind uselessly.

224
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,430
Speaker 1: And your tweets didn't do shit.

225
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,300
Speaker 1: And now, what are people doing?

226
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,429
Speaker 1: They're still tweeting in the wind.

227
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,090
Speaker 1: So you're eagle time.

228
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:47,608
Speaker 1: Eagle time is over.

229
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:49,489
Speaker 1: It is now the sanctuary time.

230
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,290
Speaker 1: And we're going to do shit and not just fucking tweet in the wind.

231
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:01,240
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

232
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,117
Speaker 0: This is a video from Numberphile, which we link to occasionally, but I'm not going to...

233
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:07,940
Speaker 1: Numberphile making all the things of the day.

234
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:09,400
Speaker 0: I haven't linked to them in a while.

235
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:21,020
Speaker 1: You know, I figured out, I stupidly didn't realize this before, but Numberphile and the periodic thing is like this one guy, Brady.

236
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:22,400
Speaker 1: There's other channels, too.

237
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,800
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if he does the Computerphile channel, which I don't watch.

238
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,800
Speaker 0: It's a lot like the SciShow and Vlogbrothers.

239
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,640
Speaker 0: They're all in an orbit of each other.

240
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,880
Speaker 1: There's this one dude, Brady, and he's making these videos.

241
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,479
Speaker 1: And the thing that really gets me about these videos is that he sounds like he's a person from the UK.

242
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,140
Speaker 1: And I know that the periodic place that's college is in the UK, right?

243
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,100
Speaker 1: But it seems like he's traveling around the world making these videos.

244
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:52,420
Speaker 0: Scott, just saying, if the Patreon got to a high enough level, we'd both quit our jobs and our lives would be making shit like that all the time.

245
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:53,939
Speaker 1: But I don't want to do that.

246
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:57,379
Speaker 1: It seems like it's pretty crazy, this thing this guy's got going on.

247
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,897
Speaker 0: But this video is pretty actually specifically interesting, and it talks about weird but fair dice.

248
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:05,379
Speaker 1: Oh, I saw this one.

249
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:13,219
Speaker 0: And you might think that a die has to be a regular, you know, like one of the regular three-dimensional shapes to be fair.

250
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:13,592
Speaker 0: Nope.

251
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,838
Speaker 0: And that is not true.

252
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:27,720
Speaker 0: To be fair, a die merely needs to be symmetrical, and this video does an excellent job of making that abundantly clear, and I kind of want some dice like that just to start arguments at tables, at conventions.

253
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,700
Speaker 1: It's good for an RPG, that kind of dice, right, where it's not gambling.

254
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,160
Speaker 0: Well, for gambling, it should be fine, actually.

255
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:35,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you know.

256
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,398
Speaker 0: Also, the funniest thing is he's rolling, what, like the D120, and he rolls a one twice in a row.

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:57,960
Speaker 1: So anyway, you know, back in the day, I remember, especially in the college days, right, there was this period in my life, like when I was in middle school, high school, where like Japan seemed like this mystical place full of nerd magic, and very rarely did you actually learn anything about the nerd magic they had there.

258
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,176
Speaker 1: Maybe like you'd get a video game magazine to be a picture of an arcade game they had there that you were just like, "Holy

259
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:03,460
Speaker 1: shit.".

260
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,538
Speaker 0: Yep, and it'd have a caption that just says like, "Gundam game in

261
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:06,880
Speaker 0: Japan."

262
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,940
Speaker 0: It doesn't tell you shit about it.

263
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,620
Speaker 1: Or like you'd get an anime that was dubbed.

264
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,440
Speaker 1: You'd be like, "Oh, glorious," right?

265
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,720
Speaker 1: And then in college, it was like the Japan Fiesta.

266
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:21,600
Speaker 0: It was like-- RIT that had this giant anime club.

267
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:33,038
Speaker 1: But anyway, you know, we eventually, like even early in the Geek Nights days, we were still like half my things of the day were funny things from Japanese TV, because we finally had internet and YouTube and things like that.

268
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:41,399
Speaker 1: But eventually, the cool Japan magic never completely wears off, because Japan is still way cool in Nerd Paradise.

269
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,918
Speaker 1: But eventually, you're like, "Okay, another cool thing from Japan.

270
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:46,139
Speaker 1: All

271
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:46,320
Speaker 1: right.".

272
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:48,733
Speaker 1: But here's one that I saw recently.

273
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,000
Speaker 1: that was pretty awesome.

274
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:53,940
Speaker 1: And you know, it's too early for Christmas shit, but this is too awesome.

275
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,659
Speaker 1: It breaks the rule.

276
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:58,760
Speaker 1: It's a Coke bottle, poison I don't drink, from Japan.

277
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,319
Speaker 1: And it's a Christmas-style one.

278
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,880
Speaker 1: And I don't know why they only have this in Japan.

279
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,499
Speaker 1: It's like they only, you know, they just hate us.

280
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,200
Speaker 0: All right, I'm just watching this video to see what happens here.

281
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,919
Speaker 1: Oh, you never saw the video?

282
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,243
Speaker 1: Nope.

283
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:14,699
Speaker 0: I never-- I did not see this.

284
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:15,240
Speaker 0: Okay.

285
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:17,580
Speaker 0: All right, so you see he's pulling-- What?

286
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,875
Speaker 0: Oh, I see what's going on here.

287
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:22,538
Speaker 0: That's good.

288
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,098
Speaker 1: It's real good.

289
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:26,118
Speaker 0: God damn it.

290
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:27,526
Speaker 0: Why--.

291
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:28,640
Speaker 0: This is why we can't have nice things.

292
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,430
Speaker 1: Only, you know, the U.S.

293
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,719
Speaker 1: just doesn't have nice things, and now we're going to have less nice things.

294
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:33,698
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah.

295
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:35,940
Speaker 0: Way to bring it back around.

296
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:41,438
Speaker 0: Well, you know, speaking of nice things, when Emily and I were in Sydney, the one thing that's-- They didn't have that.

297
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:42,058
Speaker 1: Nope.

298
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,620
Speaker 1: And isn't their money worth nothing?

299
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,713
Speaker 0: But they're doing okay now.

300
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,000
Speaker 0: But the subway in Sydney, because you've been on the trams, like they were like okay in Melbourne.

301
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,999
Speaker 1: It's much newer than ours.

302
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,939
Speaker 0: The subway in Sydney not only has padded cloth seats-- The New York City subway used to.

303
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:01,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, does not now.

304
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:02,076
Speaker 0: No.

305
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,019
Speaker 0: Because they would literally be full of poop.

306
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:04,520
Speaker 0: Yes.

307
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,720
Speaker 0: Like they would be cut open, filled with poop, and smeared with poop.

308
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,958
Speaker 1: Metro and art trains have them.

309
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:11,520
Speaker 0: Not really.

310
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:13,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're padded.

311
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:13,994
Speaker 0: They're padded.

312
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:15,080
Speaker 0: They're leather seats.

313
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,880
Speaker 0: They're waterproof leather, and they're, you know, they're padded by the barest technical definition of padded.

314
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,017
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

315
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,560
Speaker 0: These are thick, plush seats.

316
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,620
Speaker 0: Like if you spilled something into them, it's gone.

317
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,320
Speaker 1: Like first class airplane?

318
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:33,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I could pee into one of those things for days before it started coming out.

319
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,236
Speaker 0: Like you could pee.

320
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:34,878
Speaker 1: All right.

321
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:36,920
Speaker 0: So yeah, we could not have that here.

322
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:37,589
Speaker 1: No.

323
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,280
Speaker 0: In a moment, the Book Club book is Rebecca.

324
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:42,378
Speaker 0: Rebecca.

325
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:45,439
Speaker 0: I'm going to read it because I finished all those other books I was working on.

326
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,979
Speaker 0: They're pretty good and all that stuff.

327
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,556
Speaker 1: I'm going to read it because my queue is really open right now.

328
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:00,420
Speaker 0: You know what I'm going to read right after I finish Rebecca because I've read excerpts from it, but I feel remiss that I've never actually read Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.

329
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:01,579
Speaker 1: Oh, that one?

330
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:02,057
Speaker 1: Yeah.

331
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,898
Speaker 0: And I feel like I missed that man, so I'm going to read that.

332
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,680
Speaker 0: Otherwise, one great thing, GamerX East is this weekend.

333
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:12,852
Speaker 1: G-A-Y-M-E-R-X.

334
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,660
Speaker 0: It is unfortunately, as of today, if you're not already going, too late to get badges.

335
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:18,480
Speaker 1: It's sold out.

336
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,780
Speaker 1: Is it sold out or is it just too late?

337
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:21,679
Speaker 0: It's too late.

338
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,079
Speaker 0: I think it might also be sold out.

339
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,778
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

340
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:25,680
Speaker 1: So you can't get them at the door.

341
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,479
Speaker 0: Oh, you might be able to get them until midnight tonight.

342
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:28,640
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

343
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,899
Speaker 0: It's because it's in a secure building, so there's a list you have to be on.

344
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,140
Speaker 1: Oh, it's one of those.

345
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:35,520
Speaker 1: Actually, where is it?

346
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:36,759
Speaker 1: It's in the Microsoft space.

347
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,020
Speaker 1: Oh, right near the Muji store?

348
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,459
Speaker 0: I think so.

349
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,079
Speaker 0: I think it's that one.

350
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:41,820
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

351
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:42,580
Speaker 0: It's like right there.

352
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:46,260
Speaker 1: I thought it was in a real space, so it's not going to be as big as I thought.

353
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,240
Speaker 0: No, it's small, but it's sort of like an outreach thing.

354
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,839
Speaker 0: I feel like it's good timing that we're going to this.

355
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,240
Speaker 1: I feel like a lot of people -- No, I mean, I can play games all day.

356
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,739
Speaker 1: Are you going to go there as soon as it starts Saturday?

357
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:55,937
Speaker 0: Maybe.

358
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,059
Speaker 0: Maybe we should probably just go there as soon as it starts, and we can always leave early and get food.

359
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, just going to bring games with me, right?

360
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm going to bring a small but choice collection of tabletop games.

361
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:04,880
Speaker 1: Yep.

362
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,640
Speaker 0: And someday we're going to be giving a talk -- I'll bring some RPG.

363
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:19,403
Speaker 0: We're going to be doing our writing game rules panel, but if you already knew who we are, if you're already listening to this, tell other people to go to our panel, but don't you fucking go to it, because it's a small room, and I'd rather people who don't know who we are -- How small

364
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:19,645
Speaker 1: am I?

365
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,440
Speaker 1: -- why am I doing this thing if the room is so small?

366
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:25,459
Speaker 0: Because I got to get the word out.

367
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:34,779
Speaker 0: I mean, even at PAX, where like I think 80% of the people who go to our panels go to them only because they know it's not doing them, there's always at least one person who's like, "Who the fuck are these guys?

368
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:38,646
Speaker 0: Why are all these people weirdly excited about them, and can I get my money back for my

369
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:39,068
Speaker 0: badge?".

370
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:48,780
Speaker 0: And the only other silver line -- oh, yeah, so my thing of the day was the dice thing, where I did the meta -- I'm distracted, obviously.

371
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,899
Speaker 1: You're in the meta moment right now.

372
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,000
Speaker 0: Any other meta other than follow our YouTube channels, follow the other stuff we might be doing, and stay strong.

373
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,638
Speaker 0: I can't believe we didn't do a show on this.

374
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:00,499
Speaker 1: I also don't believe that.

375
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:09,958
Speaker 0: Scott legit did not believe me and spent a while trying to prove me wrong when I said we've never done a show on wallets, and I do not fault him for that because I would not have believed me.

376
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,479
Speaker 0: But I was literally -- when Thursday shows come around, you'll know what our process is for figuring out the show.

377
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:26,497
Speaker 0: Scott's at work, and I'm at work, and I'm sitting at my desk, and I literally look around the room and start typing nouns that I see into the chat, and then Scott one by one says, "Those are all terrible ideas for

378
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:26,819
Speaker 0: shows.".

379
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:29,760
Speaker 0: And my wallet happened to be on my desk, and I was like, "Wallets?

380
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:31,572
Speaker 0: I don't think we've done a show on

381
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:31,935
Speaker 0: wallets.".

382
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:34,640
Speaker 0: In fact, I couldn't even find a show on The Jimmy.

383
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:40,940
Speaker 0: And I remember we talked about The Jimmy so much that the company that made The Jimmy actually found us and gave us free Jimmys.

384
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,685
Speaker 0: Remember that?

385
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:43,918
Speaker 0: That was a long time ago.

386
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:46,517
Speaker 0: So the Jimmy wallet, of course, is gone.

387
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,740
Speaker 0: That company, as far as I can tell, is gone.

388
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:51,220
Speaker 0: And I guess we're talking about wallets.

389
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,393
Speaker 1: Yeah.

390
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:56,180
Speaker 0: So big wallet or small wallet?

391
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:04,240
Speaker 1: I mean, when I was originally getting wallets, right, this was back in the day before there was even real internet or internet shopping or anything.

392
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:15,199
Speaker 1: So my idea of a wallet was the only kind of wallet I'd ever seen in my life, which was a wallet that folds in the middle, has a place to put money, and then a bunch of card slots and even a photo thingy.

393
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,680
Speaker 1: I felt like I had to get photos and put them in, right, because it comes with the stupid photo thing.

394
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,780
Speaker 1: That's the only image I ever had of a wallet in my mind.

395
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:28,500
Speaker 1: So when I needed one, I went to the department store, like Macy's or whatever.

396
00:20:29,404 --> 00:20:31,498
Speaker 1: And there's that rack of -- They had a whole bunch of them.

397
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,620
Speaker 0: Black and brown leather men's bi-fold or tri-fold wallets.

398
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I would buy a bi-fold one that -- I always did the tri-fold.

399
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,979
Speaker 1: The most, you know, normal-looking-ish -- Oh, the ones that has the extra up-flip.

400
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,076
Speaker 0: Yep, it goes buh-bup.

401
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,380
Speaker 0: So you open it halfway, and you can get, like, your cards out.

402
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I got that kind of one.

403
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,479
Speaker 0: And then you open it all the way, and the ID is sitting there, because when you're, like, that's the age where you actually have to show an ID a lot for stuff.

404
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:58,159
Speaker 0: Yep.

405
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,360
Speaker 0: Just in general, like, bus passes or whatever, because you're a kid.

406
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:05,000
Speaker 0: And you use your driver's license, and you're excited about having a driver's license.

407
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,826
Speaker 1: And so I just -- I had that kind of wallet.

408
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:11,739
Speaker 1: always until, like, even in college, I had that kind of wallet, and I would lose it.

409
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,484
Speaker 0: Wow.

410
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:17,020
Speaker 0: I only ever lost my wallet once in my entire life.

411
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:18,659
Speaker 1: I've lost it two times.

412
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:21,069
Speaker 0: And, actually, I lost it.

413
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,420
Speaker 0: I canceled all my cards and, like, did all the stuff.

414
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,780
Speaker 0: This was in high school, ninth grade.

415
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:32,115
Speaker 0: And then, literally, like, four days later, a friend of mine in high school was like, "Oh, by the way, I found your wallet in the woods

416
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:32,437
Speaker 0: here.".

417
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,019
Speaker 0: Literally found it in the woods.

418
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,400
Speaker 1: I think -- I lost two.

419
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,620
Speaker 1: One, I was in Israel, and I had -- I think I put it in a bathing suit pocket.

420
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,900
Speaker 0: That's dangerous.

421
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:48,018
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't -- this was, like, after --.

422
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:48,945
Speaker 0: Oh, I know, I know.

423
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:55,680
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, the danger of the bathing suit pocket is, one, those pockets suck, and it's really easy to fall out, and, two, you might forget it's there and go back in the water.

424
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,163
Speaker 1: No.

425
00:21:56,304 --> 00:22:01,578
Speaker 1: This was not at a water -- I had it, and we were already back at the temporary hoe hostel.

426
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,878
Speaker 0: Okay, okay.

427
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:11,580
Speaker 1: And I took a shower, and the bathing suit was, like, on the floor or hanging with the wallet in it while I was showering.

428
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,412
Speaker 1: It was a one-person bathroom.

429
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:15,260
Speaker 1: It wasn't, like, some -- Oh, did someone take the wallet?

430
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:22,140
Speaker 1: I don't know, but, like, that's where I remembered it being, and the next time I went for it, it knew there.

431
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:22,702
Speaker 0: Oh.

432
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:31,520
Speaker 1: And this next time that I lost a wallet was at RIT, and I'm pretty sure I left it on the DDR machine at the Putt-Putt.

433
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:33,099
Speaker 0: I remember that.

434
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:35,039
Speaker 1: And then it was not there.

435
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,660
Speaker 0: Because we drove back over there.

436
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,099
Speaker 1: Which is why my anime club membership cards only go so far back.

437
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,380
Speaker 1: They don't go any farther back than that, and since then, I have not lost a wallet.

438
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,300
Speaker 1: I've only replaced highly damaged wallets and such.

439
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:55,500
Speaker 0: So I had this weird point of pride where I had this trifold wallet, and I always got the simplest, smooth, black leather one.

440
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,860
Speaker 0: Like, never any other color, never any adornment of any kind.

441
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,760
Speaker 1: I would get the simplest, smoothest, brown leather one.

442
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:08,300
Speaker 0: Before I had credit cards, I had all this shit that I kept in my wallet, and then thinking back -- I also kept a bunch of shit in there.

443
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,420
Speaker 0: Like, I can't picture individually what all those things were, but I remember there being all these different cards in there.

444
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,060
Speaker 1: Basically, there's a whole -- I know what the cards are, because I now keep those cards in the drawer of my desk.

445
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,080
Speaker 0: Oh, you know where I keep mine?

446
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:22,820
Speaker 0: I have my old Jimmy wallet that's broken.

447
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,699
Speaker 1: Oh, you put it in there?

448
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:28,460
Speaker 0: All my extra, like, second-tier shit is in that backup wallet.

449
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:34,874
Speaker 1: So things that I would keep in old wallets that I no longer keep are things like photos, right?

450
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:35,720
Speaker 1: No one does that anymore.

451
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,160
Speaker 0: I used to carry my Social Security card around for some reason, because I was just stupid, so now that's in a vault.

452
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,440
Speaker 1: I've never kept that in -- I keep that in my house.

453
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,517
Speaker 0: Well, my wallet -- I don't lose my wallet, so...

454
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:46,011
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even so, right?

455
00:23:46,031 --> 00:23:47,020
Speaker 1: There's no reason to carry it around.

456
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:47,760
Speaker 0: Not anymore.

457
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:57,040
Speaker 1: I would keep -- for example, like, I'd get a rewards card somewhere, and then I'd actually -- like, I had a media -- My Funko Land card.

458
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,460
Speaker 1: For example, like, a media play card, which we used to have, right?

459
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,528
Speaker 1: Yup.

460
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,620
Speaker 1: And I would just always have it with me.

461
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,269
Speaker 1: It's like, but now I have --.

462
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,240
Speaker 1: the only rewards card I really have now is, like, the Rite Aid card.

463
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:07,579
Speaker 0: I just got my phone number in.

464
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,100
Speaker 1: Well, I actually got a -- I give them, like, a fake deal, right?

465
00:24:12,342 --> 00:24:12,877
Speaker 1: So it's not --.

466
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,654
Speaker 0: Well, when I say my phone number, I mean 867-5309, which totally works.

467
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:20,320
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't give them -- I gave them -- I don't remember the fake number I gave them.

468
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,998
Speaker 0: I just put in -- I literally put in 212-867-5309 every time, and it totally works.

469
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:28,190
Speaker 1: Oh, no, that song is 364-5789.

470
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:30,300
Speaker 1: Anyway.

471
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:32,780
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I don't remember the number I gave them.

472
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,260
Speaker 1: So, like -- but that card, I don't carry around with me everywhere.

473
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,659
Speaker 1: I just leave it in my drawer, and if I'm going to Rite Aid, I bring it with me.

474
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:39,258
Speaker 0: Yup.

475
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:41,334
Speaker 1: I wish I could just use my phone to do it.

476
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:46,240
Speaker 0: I don't need the stupid -- So, a card I had -- the thing is, in the old days, like, if you didn't have your card, like, you were fine.

477
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,599
Speaker 1: Like, you needed the card to get the thing, but now -- Well, at least when I was in Connecticut, there was some kind of law where they couldn't make you have the card.

478
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,095
Speaker 1: Ooh.

479
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,960
Speaker 1: You could just -- I don't know if that's still true or -- I don't know.

480
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,420
Speaker 0: Because, like, I have the REI card.

481
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,819
Speaker 1: Someone out there, tell me.

482
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:03,019
Speaker 0: Because the REI thing is actually, like, if you're a sports person, is a really good deal.

483
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,880
Speaker 1: But isn't REI, in general, a rip-off?

484
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,400
Speaker 1: You could just buy from Amazon and probably save just as much money.

485
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:07,783
Speaker 0: Nah.

486
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:08,640
Speaker 0: Depends on what you're buying.

487
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:20,135
Speaker 0: Like, if I'm getting ski boots that I need to try on in person, and then I'm getting form-fitted to my foot, if I'm getting clothes that I need to try on because they're highly specialized, and, actually, their prices are really good.

488
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:24,760
Speaker 0: You're thinking of, like, generic sportsy stuff.

489
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,019
Speaker 0: I'm talking, like, specific specialized gear, like bindings for skis and shit.

490
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't buy that.

491
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:36,134
Speaker 0: But, anyway, the way it works is you pay some trivial amount of money, and you remember if they're, like, co-op -- We don't need any REI advertising.

492
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:36,740
Speaker 1: Talk about wallets.

493
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,960
Speaker 0: I know, but anyway, the card's really good, and it's saved me a crazy shit ton of money.

494
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,439
Speaker 1: But you don't carry it with you all the time.

495
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:43,206
Speaker 1: Nope.

496
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:44,780
Speaker 0: I don't -- You know where that is?

497
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,514
Speaker 0: It's sitting in my Jimmy wallet, because if I go to the store, they're just like, "What's your

498
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:48,779
Speaker 0: name?".

499
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:50,240
Speaker 0: And then they look me up, and it's all good.

500
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,900
Speaker 1: So, now, since the Jimmy times, I don't use a Jimmy anymore.

501
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,160
Speaker 1: I usually go on Kickstarter and find some tiny wallet, like the tiniest, slimmest wallet I can find.

502
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,280
Speaker 0: That is what I have done.

503
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:03,160
Speaker 0: I have bought so many Kickstarter wallets, and they've all been great.

504
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:06,700
Speaker 0: Then they wore out, and then there's no way to get another one.

505
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,480
Speaker 1: I go on Kickstarter and find another tiny wallet.

506
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,840
Speaker 1: So the one I have right now is August brand.

507
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,360
Speaker 0: I don't know what mine is called.

508
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:13,139
Speaker 1: It's like the month.

509
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,520
Speaker 1: And basically, what it is, is on both sides, there's, like, a little sort of, like, pouch almost.

510
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,819
Speaker 1: And on one side is my MetroCard, and then the other side is some cash that's folded up.

511
00:26:24,442 --> 00:26:28,859
Speaker 1: And then in the middle, there's a little thing you can pull, and you pull it, and all the cards come out.

512
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:31,253
Speaker 0: I have the slim wallet.

513
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:32,140
Speaker 0: It's just called the slim wallet.

514
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,919
Speaker 1: Yours looks very similar in mechanism to mine with the boop.

515
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,404
Speaker 0: Yep.

516
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:35,815
Speaker 0: Boop.

517
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,600
Speaker 1: But yours only has a pouch on one side.

518
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:39,260
Speaker 1: Mine -- Yours has a clip on one side.

519
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,520
Speaker 0: It has a pouch on one side and a money clip on the other side.

520
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,920
Speaker 1: Mine has a pouch and a pouch.

521
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,379
Speaker 0: And the money clip is carbon fiber.

522
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,120
Speaker 0: I can fit, like, 400 bucks in here if I need to.

523
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, that actually might be slightly better than mine.

524
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,951
Speaker 1: No, you know why it's better?

525
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:50,660
Speaker 1: You know why it's better?

526
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:52,014
Speaker 1: I have to fold the money.

527
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:52,460
Speaker 1: You don't.

528
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:53,640
Speaker 1: I don't have to fold it.

529
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:55,880
Speaker 1: And I think yours can hold more money.

530
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:58,060
Speaker 0: Like I said, you can fit 400 bucks in this thing.

531
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,311
Speaker 1: Yeah.

532
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:02,680
Speaker 0: And that's right behind the money, is where I put the key to get into a hotel room.

533
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:06,460
Speaker 0: so I can boop, boop, because all the rest of this thing is RFID blocking.

534
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,640
Speaker 1: So here's the cards I have in the wallet.

535
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,480
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, let's go through it.

536
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,740
Speaker 0: I got a credit card.

537
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,600
Speaker 0: I have the main credit card.

538
00:27:13,943 --> 00:27:14,618
Speaker 1: The ATM card.

539
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,719
Speaker 0: Backup credit card.

540
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:18,340
Speaker 1: The backup credit card is in my dress drawer.

541
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,638
Speaker 0: I have ATM card.

542
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,200
Speaker 1: Yep.

543
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:20,900
Speaker 0: Metro card.

544
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:22,460
Speaker 1: Metro card is in the pouch-y part.

545
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,080
Speaker 0: It's in the pouch-y part.

546
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,859
Speaker 0: Healthcare card.

547
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,600
Speaker 1: Yep, I got that.

548
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,300
Speaker 0: Which covers dental and medical.

549
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:31,300
Speaker 1: For dental, I need the separate flimsy piece of paper, but I have both of those cards, basically.

550
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:34,520
Speaker 0: Old by multiple generations.

551
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,840
Speaker 0: New York State driver's license.

552
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also have driver's license.

553
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,919
Speaker 1: And the picture on it, I have hair.

554
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,180
Speaker 0: Wow, yours is newer.

555
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,838
Speaker 0: Look how fucking beat up an old mine is.

556
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:42,856
Speaker 1: When does yours expire?

557
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:43,060
Speaker 1: yet?

558
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,920
Speaker 0: Mine expires next year, actually.

559
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,880
Speaker 1: Mine expires in 2018.

560
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,400
Speaker 1: So two years.

561
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,420
Speaker 0: And then I have business credit card, because I use it actually a lot.

562
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:55,339
Speaker 1: I have the laundry card.

563
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:57,180
Speaker 1: Oh, I just used quarters.

564
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,079
Speaker 1: I used to keep the laundry card.

565
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:00,860
Speaker 0: Oh, and I have second Metro card.

566
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,720
Speaker 0: This is the cash card.

567
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,559
Speaker 0: I only use one of mine.

568
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,999
Speaker 1: My second Metro card's in my messenger bag.

569
00:28:04,341 --> 00:28:05,880
Speaker 0: My second Metro card, I just keep it with me.

570
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:07,340
Speaker 1: I only use it for AirTrain.

571
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,399
Speaker 0: AirTrain, occasionally Path.

572
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,839
Speaker 1: I don't take the Path.

573
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,099
Speaker 0: I occasionally do, because I have business in Jersey.

574
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,860
Speaker 1: I'm not going there.

575
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:21,599
Speaker 1: I got the laundry card, and I was keeping the laundry card out of the wallet, but then I lost the laundry card, so in the wallet it doesn't get lost.

576
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, that makes sense.

577
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,780
Speaker 1: And then I have two RFID door opening cards.

578
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,840
Speaker 1: One opens the entrance to the office building, and one opens our office.

579
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:31,438
Speaker 1: Let's see.

580
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,180
Speaker 1: So I can get into the office building at night after it closes and the doormat is not there anymore.

581
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:37,089
Speaker 0: Oh, and I have $45 in cash.

582
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:39,658
Speaker 1: Oh, how much can I -- Just right now.

583
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,939
Speaker 0: That's just what happens to be in here.

584
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,500
Speaker 1: I have 20, 40, 60, 80.

585
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,619
Speaker 0: Because you don't keep the ones in that wallet.

586
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,940
Speaker 1: I have $80, and then all the ones are in my messenger bag.

587
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,779
Speaker 0: See, I can actually -- I put the ones in here.

588
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:52,340
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

589
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,540
Speaker 0: Does that prevent the one problem from building up?

590
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,680
Speaker 0: Because I actually use them, like, regularly.

591
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,480
Speaker 0: I don't have a why.

592
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,700
Speaker 1: But the thing is, having the fistful of ones can actually be useful at certain times.

593
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:03,559
Speaker 0: I use it at, like, if I -- If we go out to have dinner with friends.

594
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:05,199
Speaker 1: If I go to a cash-only place.

595
00:29:05,683 --> 00:29:07,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I increasingly try to boycott cash-only places.

596
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:13,400
Speaker 1: One time, I was buying some -- just, like, two slices of pizza, right?

597
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:15,920
Speaker 1: And it was, like, $3.50 or something.

598
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:21,480
Speaker 0: So I bring out -- Well, downtown, the place I get pizza at, it's $7.45 to get two slices of pizza.

599
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,219
Speaker 1: This is in Astoria.

600
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:22,755
Speaker 1: Okay.

601
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,998
Speaker 1: At the Chubby's Garbage Place under my -- Oh, okay, okay, okay.

602
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:34,599
Speaker 1: And I pull out my fistful of ones, and the guy's, like -- the guy sees my ones, and I couldn't understand what he was saying at first, but he wanted my ones.

603
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:38,000
Speaker 1: So I counted him 20 ones, and he gave me a 20.

604
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,485
Speaker 1: And I was like, "All

605
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:38,848
Speaker 1: right.".

606
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,452
Speaker 1: Because he's like, "He needed the ones.

607
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:41,794
Speaker 1: He was a

608
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:42,157
Speaker 1: store.".

609
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,597
Speaker 1: So the other thing you can do with the pile of ones is go to an ATM and shove them in.

610
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:48,998
Speaker 1: Right?

611
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,132
Speaker 1: So you can be like -- Maybe you got 70 ones.

612
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,500
Speaker 1: You shove them in there, and then you withdraw 50 bucks, and it's like, "Hey, I just increased my checking account.

613
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:57,788
Speaker 1: Great.".

614
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:01,559
Speaker 0: Oh, so the other benefit of this one is that the money clip has this little ridge sticking out of it.

615
00:30:01,784 --> 00:30:02,178
Speaker 1: I see that.

616
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:04,459
Speaker 0: And what that's for is to -- That actually looks not good.

617
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,431
Speaker 0: No, so I thought that when I first came, I was like, "Oh, this is going to be a

618
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:07,778
Speaker 0: problem.".

619
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:10,658
Speaker 0: If you put it with the ridge face in your butt, you literally don't feel it.

620
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,600
Speaker 1: Oh, so you put the wallet in the back pocket.

621
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:13,140
Speaker 1: Yeah.

622
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:14,400
Speaker 1: I put it in the front pocket.

623
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,960
Speaker 0: I've never -- front pocket wallet is garbage tier.

624
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,640
Speaker 1: Front -- What I do -- Rear wallet, first of all, you're sitting on something.

625
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:23,840
Speaker 0: It's poking you in the butt.

626
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,660
Speaker 1: You're also unbalancing your ass.

627
00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:27,720
Speaker 1: Is one ass cheek smaller than the other?

628
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,779
Speaker 1: You put it on the small cheek?

629
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,480
Speaker 0: Look where it sits.

630
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,220
Speaker 0: It's so small and so slim that it sits to the left of the butt bone.

631
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:35,600
Speaker 1: You sit on the edge of your chair like that?

632
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,157
Speaker 1: No, even here.

633
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,280
Speaker 0: My butt's not on it.

634
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,500
Speaker 0: Look.

635
00:30:38,242 --> 00:30:39,100
Speaker 0: See the outline of the wallet?

636
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,360
Speaker 1: I see where you put it, and I guess that's true.

637
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:43,799
Speaker 0: All my jeans are like that.

638
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,839
Speaker 0: By design, I don't wear pants where the back pocket wallet doesn't work.

639
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,380
Speaker 1: But I put it in the front right pocket.

640
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,660
Speaker 1: What do you put in your front right pocket?

641
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,799
Speaker 0: Front right pocket is phone.

642
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,979
Speaker 0: Front left pocket is keys.

643
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,612
Speaker 0: Right now, back --.

644
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,960
Speaker 1: Oh, see, front right pocket is wallet.

645
00:30:58,161 --> 00:30:59,640
Speaker 1: Front left pocket is phone.

646
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,399
Speaker 0: Where do you put your keys?

647
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,398
Speaker 1: Keys somewhere else.

648
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:02,798
Speaker 0: Ah, no, because I don't carry my bag.

649
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,820
Speaker 0: I carry my bag all the time.

650
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:14,939
Speaker 1: Well, if I have to take my keys out of my bag, I put them in with the wallet or in a coat pocket, if I'm wearing a coat, or -- I don't like having anything -- Oh, and the key pocket is where any extraneous change goes.

651
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:15,545
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

652
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,600
Speaker 0: Because I don't want that banging around against my phone.

653
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, never put anything metal in the phone pocket.

654
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,118
Speaker 1: Yes.

655
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,391
Speaker 0: That is an egregious offense.

656
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,259
Speaker 1: My boss, he's like, "My phone's all scratched

657
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:27,359
Speaker 1: up.".

658
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,138
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Do you put your keys in with your

659
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:29,360
Speaker 1: phone?".

660
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,772
Speaker 1: And he's like,

661
00:31:29,793 --> 00:31:29,896
Speaker 1: "Yeah.".

662
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:31,179
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Duh.

663
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:34,959
Speaker 1: Don't put anything in with your phone pocket except your

664
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:35,080
Speaker 1: phone.".

665
00:31:35,142 --> 00:31:35,620
Speaker 0: It's like my face hurts.

666
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,660
Speaker 0: Do you keep scraping it with sandpaper?

667
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:41,140
Speaker 1: Oh, that must be it.

668
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:50,060
Speaker 0: But anyway, the ridge does not cause any bother at all, no matter what direction it's facing, but it means you can stick your finger in and very easily pull the wallet out of even, tight pants.

669
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,920
Speaker 1: Ah, easy for the pickpocket to pull it out of your pants.

670
00:31:53,142 --> 00:31:54,400
Speaker 0: Ah, because I wear such tight pants.

671
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,880
Speaker 0: I've actually thought about that a lot.

672
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:07,320
Speaker 0: So when I'm on the subway, if I'm wearing pants where someone could conceivably get my wallet out pickpocket style, I move it to the front left pocket with the keys until I'm off the subway.

673
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,700
Speaker 1: I've thought about getting an ostentatious fake rear pocket wallet.

674
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:12,456
Speaker 0: Ooh, it's just full of like explosions.

675
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, full of like, you know.

676
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:15,898
Speaker 0: Skunk juice.

677
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,180
Speaker 1: Contact poison.

678
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,458
Speaker 0: Ampules of skunk juice.

679
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,459
Speaker 1: Just whatever, right?

680
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,639
Speaker 1: Because I mean, it's not really a concern in New York.

681
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:33,060
Speaker 1: Despite New York being a huge city, it's probably in terms of like, it's not saying there's no pickpocketing in New York City, but pickpocketing per person in New York City is probably the lowest of any major city.

682
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,660
Speaker 1: Like the stories I hear, never having been there, is that like Paris is like pickpocket central, right?

683
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:49,740
Speaker 1: And I've never heard anyone, like when I've said that, maybe, you know, when I've, uh, when I've propagated that rumor, people have not said, that's just a stereotype.

684
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:50,538
Speaker 1: It's not true.

685
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:53,880
Speaker 1: They've said, oh, they said, yes, very true.

686
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:54,920
Speaker 1: Watch out when you're right.

687
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,780
Speaker 1: So, um, so like I imagined I would use it if I was traveling in such a place.

688
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,640
Speaker 0: So I like this wallet a lot, but I liked the wallet I had before better.

689
00:33:05,185 --> 00:33:06,319
Speaker 0: It was even more minimalist.

690
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,179
Speaker 0: It was just this like metal wire with some leather around it.

691
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,880
Speaker 0: And I held all my cards in the middle so I could flip them up with my thumb.

692
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:15,500
Speaker 0: And the rest of the wire on the back was a money clip.

693
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:19,200
Speaker 0: And it was seriously like four millimeters thinner than even this thing.

694
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,719
Speaker 0: And this thing is real fucking thin.

695
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,460
Speaker 0: But it eventually wore out and it was a Kickstarter project.

696
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:25,300
Speaker 0: So I can't get it again.

697
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,899
Speaker 1: The one I have now is slightly wearing out.

698
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:28,512
Speaker 0: Yup.

699
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:31,559
Speaker 0: So before this, I used the Jimmy X.

700
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:32,755
Speaker 1: Me too.

701
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,260
Speaker 0: Which back then, like there wasn't a Kickstarter.

702
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,920
Speaker 0: The Jimmy was literally the only like modern wallet on earth as far as I could tell.

703
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,780
Speaker 0: And right when Kickstarter started, there were like 40 different wallet projects.

704
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,959
Speaker 0: They were all kind of garbage.

705
00:33:47,660 --> 00:34:04,179
Speaker 0: Uh, so I used that trifold for the longest time, but when I switched out of it was when we got the Jimmy, because the trifold is actually inferior to the bifold, but my dumb kid brain didn't realize at the time, because it makes it substantially thicker in your pocket unless you don't carry any cash ever.

706
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:08,219
Speaker 0: And a thick wallet is not a thing I can deal with.

707
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:10,619
Speaker 0: I don't understand the people of the wallet where you open it.

708
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,500
Speaker 0: And then inside there's like more divisions in the top so you can like separate different kinds of bills.

709
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,045
Speaker 1: Yeah.

710
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:23,719
Speaker 0: Or the people who have the full on bill fold that has like all the cards arrayed in this like deck.

711
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:25,672
Speaker 1: I mean, back in the day, right?

712
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,878
Speaker 1: It was the best because like, well, you had a million cards.

713
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:28,241
Speaker 1: Right.

714
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:29,268
Speaker 1: Well, no, even more.

715
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:36,000
Speaker 1: back in the day, like my grandfather, he would like, he owned the mechanic and he was a mechanic and no fucking credit cards, right?

716
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,599
Speaker 1: It's like he just had a cash clip and that was it.

717
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:41,719
Speaker 1: Money, money, money, just cash, tons of it.

718
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:42,404
Speaker 1: Right.

719
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:43,779
Speaker 1: And that's what we carry around.

720
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:45,469
Speaker 1: That was it.

721
00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:46,338
Speaker 1: Nothing else.

722
00:34:46,862 --> 00:34:46,949
Speaker 0: Yeah.

723
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:50,260
Speaker 0: So, but I'm pretty much all I want now is super minimal.

724
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:59,060
Speaker 0: And maybe seven years ago, I wouldn't have considered this a concern, but you probably should get a wallet that blocks RFID in the modern era.

725
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,799
Speaker 1: There are multiple, I mean, there's no negative to having it.

726
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,109
Speaker 0: Yup.

727
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:17,060
Speaker 0: And there are multiple demonstrated proofs of concept of doing such shit as taking a contact, like basically a point of sale system and just walking up behind someone and charging their credit card through their pocket.

728
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:18,339
Speaker 0: Like you can totally do that.

729
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:21,795
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I feel like that is worth it.

730
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,619
Speaker 0: I don't know what else we can say.

731
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm looking at the currently available wallets on Kickstarter and it's like there's so many of them and some of them are serviceable and some of them are right out.

732
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,020
Speaker 0: You can just buy, because you know who makes the Slim Wallet?

733
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,980
Speaker 0: The same people who make that Trackline belt that we have.

734
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,234
Speaker 0: The thing is, like even some of these buyfolds.

735
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,060
Speaker 0: Look, all they make is that belt, that wallet.

736
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,081
Speaker 1: Sure.

737
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:53,358
Speaker 1: Even some of these buyfold ones I'm seeing on Kickstarter are like actually probably usable because they're so slim, even though they're fold.

738
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:53,688
Speaker 0: True.

739
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,321
Speaker 1: Right?

740
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:56,960
Speaker 1: It's like as long as you don't put a fucking shit ton of money in there.

741
00:35:57,382 --> 00:35:57,544
Speaker 1: Right?

742
00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:59,200
Speaker 1: I could probably deal with one of those, right?

743
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,999
Speaker 1: So, you know, this one is slowly wearing out, like a string came off of it the other day.

744
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:03,534
Speaker 1: Yup.

745
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:06,260
Speaker 1: So, you know, when it wears out, we'll see what I go for.

746
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,759
Speaker 1: I might try one of these ones that's made of metal or really, I mean, you can get by with like a rubber band.

747
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:17,080
Speaker 1: I also have coworkers that use like that Invincible Wallet.

748
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,160
Speaker 1: that's basically just like a folded up piece of Tyvek.

749
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,447
Speaker 0: Oh, I've seen that.

750
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:23,080
Speaker 0: That thing's actually moderately cool.

751
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's just a normal buyfold wallet, but it's like basically invincible.

752
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:29,589
Speaker 0: You know what that's good for?

753
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:39,580
Speaker 0: I know some people who use that, like if they're going on like extreme sports stuff and they bring a wallet with them, they use that instead of their regular wallet to not get the regular wallet all stanky.

754
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,282
Speaker 1: Right.

755
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:41,151
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's...

756
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,117
Speaker 0: Leather wallets eventually smell like ass.

757
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:48,560
Speaker 0: Like that eventually happens unless you don't sweat.

758
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:49,280
Speaker 0: It's leather.

759
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:49,960
Speaker 0: Yeah.

760
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:54,192
Speaker 1: But I hope you don't sweat so much that it goes through your pants and into your wallet.

761
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:54,660
Speaker 1: That'd be weird.

762
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,360
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's just hot out and I'm wearing shorts and I'm sitting next to my wallet like, eh.

763
00:36:59,122 --> 00:36:59,678
Speaker 1: That doesn't happen.

764
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:01,659
Speaker 0: But so do you do the thing?

765
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:15,839
Speaker 0: When I travel to certain kinds of events or like certain kinds of things I'll do, I will basically go to the Minimal Wallet where I will, because I have another crapo wallet and I'll bring like less stuff with me.

766
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,300
Speaker 0: Like I bring a different wallet configuration.

767
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,060
Speaker 1: The only time I do that is in a water situation.

768
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:23,894
Speaker 1: If I go to the water park...

769
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,919
Speaker 0: I bring the jimmy, the old jimmy.

770
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:32,080
Speaker 1: I can use the jimmy, but what I used to do before the jimmy days at the water park is I had this plastic tube on a string.

771
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:33,619
Speaker 0: I remember that tube.

772
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,980
Speaker 1: And I would open the plastic tube on a string.

773
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:38,732
Speaker 0: I remember specifically you having that tube when we were at RIT.

774
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:46,180
Speaker 1: And I would shove money in the plastic tube on a string and then you screw it tight and you wear it around your neck.

775
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:59,899
Speaker 1: And now you can ride a water slide with money on you and you can get off the water slide and buy a hot dog, eat the hot dog, not have to put their wallet in the not very secure locker at the water park.

776
00:38:00,242 --> 00:38:06,220
Speaker 1: And also you put the key to the not very secure locker at the water park in the plastic tube and all your stuff is in the locker.

777
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:10,616
Speaker 1: You know, it's also good at the beach if you don't want to leave your wallet on the sand.

778
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:21,279
Speaker 1: You can just leave your towel on the sand and bring your monies with you so that you can buy ice cream or a fudgy wudgy without having to leave your money in an unsafe position unattended.

779
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,979
Speaker 0: Now what I don't understand are the people who use the wallet.

780
00:38:25,162 --> 00:38:26,618
Speaker 0: that is also a cell phone case.

781
00:38:29,346 --> 00:38:30,360
Speaker 1: I can go for that.

782
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,800
Speaker 0: I mean it's too big to put in any reasonable pocket.

783
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,619
Speaker 0: It seems like most people who do that carry a purse or a bag of some kind.

784
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,079
Speaker 1: If I found, you know, if it accommodated the thing is I don't want a case on my phone.

785
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:41,640
Speaker 1: In general.

786
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:44,900
Speaker 1: You know, I could save a whole pocket doing that.

787
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,939
Speaker 1: I see the appeal.

788
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:57,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time, the problem is if I lose my wallet between Android Pay and all the capabilities of a modern smartphone I could get home.

789
00:38:58,162 --> 00:38:58,939
Speaker 0: I could deal with shit.

790
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:04,300
Speaker 0: And if I lose my phone, my wallet guarantees that I can at least make it back to my house.

791
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:07,178
Speaker 0: If I lose both, what the fuck am I going to do?

792
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:11,179
Speaker 1: But here's one, that's true, but here's the thing.

793
00:39:11,821 --> 00:39:14,880
Speaker 1: You could use Find My iPhone to find your wallet.

794
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:16,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you could.

795
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:26,578
Speaker 1: However, the major problem is if I'm sitting there using my phone I've got all these credit cards just hanging out.

796
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:29,280
Speaker 1: That's not a good situation.

797
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,259
Speaker 0: Like on the way home today, right?

798
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:33,320
Speaker 1: I'm just showing all my cash is sticking out.

799
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,219
Speaker 0: Today I was reading Squirrel Girl, but yesterday I was reading this Wikipedia article on the way home.

800
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:43,780
Speaker 0: So, I'll just hold all my money flimsily in my hand just right there in the middle of the subway.

801
00:39:45,804 --> 00:39:46,659
Speaker 1: Keep that shit away.

802
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,420
Speaker 0: So yeah, wallets.

803
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,500
Speaker 1: I can't believe we didn't do a wallet share.

804
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:52,904
Speaker 0: I know.

805
00:39:53,288 --> 00:39:56,140
Speaker 0: I feel like that was actually Such a low hanging fruit.

806
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:56,763
Speaker 0: I know.

807
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:58,580
Speaker 0: I got us by another Thursday.

808
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,340
Speaker 0: So yeah, stay tuned.

809
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,020
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is continuing as normal.

810
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,058
Speaker 0: Come see us at GamerX.

811
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:12,358
Speaker 0: And you only seed so much ground to fascists before you start to do the things that need to be done to prevent fascists from doing what they want to do.

812
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,327
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

813
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:26,360

820
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:18,727
Speaker 0: And the Patreon Patrons in order of them I'm going to give us on a continuing basis are... Christian Kuntz, Han Thomas, and Rymer Chris.

821
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:39,244

823
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,950
Speaker 0: Keep your heads up, take a small step forward every day, and we'll get through this.

824
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,569
Speaker 0: And now I leave you with something.

825
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:15,470
Speaker 2: We don't want to hate and despise one another.

826
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:20,850
Speaker 2: In this world there's room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

827
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:25,588
Speaker 2: The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

828
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:33,830
Speaker 2: Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

829
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:37,488
Speaker 2: We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.

830
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,488
Speaker 2: Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.

831
00:42:41,277 --> 00:42:44,590
Speaker 2: Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind.

832
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,497
Speaker 2: We think too much and feel too little.

833
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,410
Speaker 2: More than machinery, we need humanity.

834
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:53,890
Speaker 2: More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.

835
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,968
Speaker 2: Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

836
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,337
Speaker 2: The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together.

837
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:07,767
Speaker 2: The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.

838
00:43:08,496 --> 00:43:19,069
Speaker 2: Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

839
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:22,899
Speaker 2: To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair.

840
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:29,890
Speaker 2: The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.

841
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:37,229
Speaker 2: The hate of men will pass and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people.

842
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,688
Speaker 2: And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

843
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:55,430
Speaker 2: Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder.

844
00:43:56,051 --> 00:44:01,749
Speaker 2: Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.

845
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:03,370
Speaker 2: You are not machines.

846
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:04,822
Speaker 2: You are not cattle.

847
00:44:05,085 --> 00:44:05,387
Speaker 2: You are men.

848
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,178
Speaker 2: You have the love of humanity in your hearts.

849
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,049
Speaker 2: You don't hate.

850
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:12,580
Speaker 2: Only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural.

851
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,090
Speaker 2: Soldiers, don't fight for slavery.

852
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:16,237
Speaker 2: Fight for liberty.

853
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:23,853
Speaker 2: In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke, it is written, "The kingdom of God is within man, not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men, in you.

854
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:29,044
Speaker 2: You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.

855
00:44:29,328 --> 00:44:34,890
Speaker 2: You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

856
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:38,319
Speaker 2: Then, in the name of democracy, let us use that power.

857
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:39,550
Speaker 2: Let us all unite.

858
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:48,238
Speaker 2: Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security.

859
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:52,440
Speaker 2: By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie.

860
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:54,157
Speaker 2: They do not fulfill that promise.

861
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:58,870
Speaker 2: They never will dictate us free themselves, but they enslave the people.

862
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:02,198
Speaker 0: Now, let us fight to fulfill that promise.

863
00:45:02,582 --> 00:45:10,019
Speaker 2: Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.

864
00:45:10,767 --> 00:45:16,869
Speaker 2: Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

865
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,296
Speaker 2: Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!
