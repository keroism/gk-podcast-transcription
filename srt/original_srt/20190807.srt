1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,458
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, August 7th, 2019.

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:12,442
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:13,024
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,104 --> 00:00:14,790
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights tonight.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,342
Speaker 1: Una se yatsura, the manga.

6
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:18,529
Speaker 0: Isn't it urasa iyatsa?

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,488
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:24,064
Speaker 1: I don't know why you're finding it so hard to get Yuzu pissed.

9
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:24,548
Speaker 0: No, I found it.

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,995
Speaker 0: You finally found something?

11
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:27,543
Speaker 0: I came in an enormous fucking jar.

12
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:28,026
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

13
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:28,568
Speaker 1: You'll use it.

14
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:28,890
Speaker 1: It's good.

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,016
Speaker 1: It also keeps for like, ever.

16
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:32,409
Speaker 0: Well, because we were at the, uh, yeah, I don't think it'll go bad.

17
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,156
Speaker 0: We were at the night market.

18
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:37,710
Speaker 0: The night market where Rym had never been, but I've been several times.

19
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,833
Speaker 0: But the first time this year.

20
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:44,630
Speaker 0: And, you know, I wanted to get a beverage and I don't drink anything carbonated or anything poison or any, you know.

21
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,510
Speaker 1: I don't drink a lot of- Scott Beasley won't drink anything but water and certain kinds of juice.

22
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,678
Speaker 0: It has to be actual fruit that was squeezed.

23
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,104
Speaker 1: Not like- And certain kinds of milk.

24
00:00:52,124 --> 00:00:53,650
Speaker 0: Not some Kool-Aid corn syrup shit.

25
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll drink certain kinds of milk and certain kinds of juice.

26
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:57,006
Speaker 1: And water.

27
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:57,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

28
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,214
Speaker 1: But not carbonated water.

29
00:00:59,475 --> 00:00:59,656
Speaker 1: No.

30
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:03,510
Speaker 0: So, one of the booths has some lemonade and it had three flavors.

31
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:04,614
Speaker 0: They have blueberry lemonade.

32
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:06,302
Speaker 0: It has strawberry lemonade.

33
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:08,050
Speaker 0: And they had yuzu lemonade.

34
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,258
Speaker 1: Now, it's funny when Emily and I showed up, because we biked there.

35
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,150
Speaker 0: Yuzu, if you don't know, is basically just like Asian super lemon.

36
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,853
Speaker 1: It's, uh, delicious.

37
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:15,776
Speaker 1: I love me some yuzu.

38
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:16,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just like a super lemon.

39
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:20,370
Speaker 0: I guess it's close to a citron, but it's not a citron, right?

40
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,316
Speaker 0: It's like a different lemon thing, right?

41
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:23,139
Speaker 1: What's the second one?

42
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:24,363
Speaker 1: The ergot?

43
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:24,824
Speaker 1: Ergot?

44
00:01:25,988 --> 00:01:26,570
Speaker 1: Whatever it's called.

45
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,494
Speaker 0: Oh, the etrog.

46
00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:28,982
Speaker 0: The lulove and the etrog.

47
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:30,369
Speaker 0: The etrog is just a citron.

48
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,194
Speaker 0: And most people just use a lemon.

49
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:34,557
Speaker 0: But anyway.

50
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,704
Speaker 0: So, right.

51
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:40,430
Speaker 0: So, I had this yuzu lemonade.

52
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,493
Speaker 0: I had the yuzu lemonade.

53
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:45,886
Speaker 1: It was funny because when we went in, the first thing we noticed was, "Oh, yuzu lemonade.

54
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:46,589
Speaker 1: We should come back and get

55
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:46,769
Speaker 1: that.".

56
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,147
Speaker 1: When I ran into you, you were like, "I'm gonna go get me some yuzu

57
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:50,690
Speaker 1: lemonade.".

58
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,111
Speaker 0: That's right.

59
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:54,702
Speaker 0: So, the yuzu lemonade, all they really did is a cup of ice, right?

60
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:57,550
Speaker 0: And they put some yuzu mush in the bottom.

61
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:01,570
Speaker 0: And I think they put an actual half a lemon slice in there also.

62
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:13,570
Speaker 0: And then they filled the cup that already was mostly full of ice with some goop at the bottom with, I guess, lemonade or watered down lemonade or really cold water or something like that.

63
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,630
Speaker 0: And then they made me stir it up a whole bunch myself.

64
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:22,888
Speaker 0: And basically what resulted is a lemonade that is just...

65
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:25,070
Speaker 1: Too good for this earth?

66
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:27,365
Speaker 0: It's really good because it's not...

67
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,010
Speaker 1: Well, it has a very citrus flavor and it's sweet, but it doesn't just taste like sugar water.

68
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:34,551
Speaker 0: Right.

69
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:35,854
Speaker 0: It doesn't taste like sugar water.

70
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:41,770
Speaker 0: A lot of lemonades these days are just like soda with a slightly lemon flavor, right?

71
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:51,450
Speaker 0: But this is like, it's sour, but it doesn't make your mouth squeeze if you were actually to buy lemon, right?

72
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:55,570
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, it's very refreshing and citrusy.

73
00:02:57,313 --> 00:02:58,790
Speaker 1: I mean, yuzu is good just in general.

74
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,429
Speaker 0: It's almost like when you eat a hot food and it tastes hot, but there is no... It doesn't reach the point of hurting you.

75
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,640
Speaker 1: Oh, speaking of which, Takamen is a new menu.

76
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:08,330
Speaker 1: They got a cold Szechuan noodle dish.

77
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:11,290
Speaker 1: It is the exact perfect amount of Szechuan spice.

78
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,941
Speaker 0: Anyway, so anyway, it was way good.

79
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:15,610
Speaker 0: So I said, man, I could just like make this.

80
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,570
Speaker 0: Why am I paying $4 for one glass?

81
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,410
Speaker 1: Yup, you can get a tub of yuzu paste.

82
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:24,269
Speaker 0: And while I was like, well, I'll just buy some yuzus and apparently that's heart easier said than done.

83
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:30,610
Speaker 0: So everyone I know was like, yo, just get the yuzu paste that they use.

84
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,521
Speaker 0: And I'm like, oh, that is what they used.

85
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:33,769
Speaker 0: I guess they didn't use yuzus.

86
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,938
Speaker 0: So I guess I should get that.

87
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,650
Speaker 0: So I tried to go shopping for it.

88
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,871
Speaker 0: So I go to the South American river and South American rivers got it for like $16.

89
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:49,450
Speaker 0: And also I started out being confused because a lot of the jars selling it didn't say yuzu paste.

90
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,910
Speaker 0: They said citron, which I guess is the, you know, they're just mislabeling it.

91
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:59,630
Speaker 0: They don't have a difference in the naming and, you know, in Korea or Japan or wherever they make it.

92
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,509
Speaker 1: It's not good enough for a second.

93
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,391
Speaker 0: Right.

94
00:04:01,512 --> 00:04:01,853
Speaker 0: It's not.

95
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:05,048
Speaker 0: It's yuzus in there, even if it says citron on the jar.

96
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:05,350
Speaker 0: Right.

97
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:10,970
Speaker 0: So I go to the Sunrise Mart, which is a Japanese market near my work.

98
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:13,289
Speaker 0: And I go there and they didn't have any.

99
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:17,009
Speaker 0: And I looked around and they found tree stumps.

100
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,555
Speaker 0: They were selling tree stumps for like $2.90.

101
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:22,223
Speaker 0: And I'm like, no, I'm not paying $3 for a package of tree stumps.

102
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,849
Speaker 1: Tree stumps cost maybe a cent to make.

103
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,351
Speaker 0: Right.

104
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,858
Speaker 0: It's like, what do tree stumps cost in Japan?

105
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:29,401
Speaker 0: 50 cent?

106
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:30,888
Speaker 0: 100 yen or something?

107
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:31,229
Speaker 0: I don't know.

108
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,748
Speaker 0: Anyway, so then I go to a Chinese market.

109
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:35,210
Speaker 0: Right.

110
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:37,678
Speaker 0: Because I'm in Chinatown area.

111
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,080
Speaker 0: Right.

112
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:39,970
Speaker 0: And the Chinese market, they also didn't have any.

113
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,238
Speaker 0: I was like, what the fuck?

114
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:42,310
Speaker 0: No one has any.

115
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,248
Speaker 0: So today I took the train to go to the H Mart, which is like a bigger, more real.

116
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,348
Speaker 1: You were very dedicated to this.

117
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,010
Speaker 0: Well, you know, because someone, one of my friends sent me a link.

118
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,043
Speaker 0: They found a place online cheaper than South American River, but it was still like, I ended up with shipping being like $12 for a jar.

119
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:05,550
Speaker 1: But that jar will make like 40 melanades.

120
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,131
Speaker 0: Yeah.

121
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:11,270
Speaker 0: But you know, the lemonade, hopefully it's still a better deal than the $4 per lemonade at the market.

122
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,150
Speaker 0: But I still don't want to pay $12 for a jar of anything.

123
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:21,371
Speaker 0: So I went to the H Mart and they had several brands to choose from and they were $8.

124
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:21,964
Speaker 0: And I was like, yes.

125
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:23,230
Speaker 1: Your cup overflowing.

126
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:24,757
Speaker 0: I'm good.

127
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:26,565
Speaker 0: Yuzu pays for like, ever.

128
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,885
Speaker 0: Because they didn't have, I was looking for the smallest one they had.

129
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:39,028
Speaker 0: because I've been all about, you know, I used to think back in the day for actually many, many years, get the best unit price on everything you buy.

130
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:39,330
Speaker 0: Right.

131
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,730
Speaker 0: It's like, well, this is a dollar an ounce and that's 50 cents an ounce.

132
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,243
Speaker 0: Get the bigger one, pay less per ounce.

133
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:46,530
Speaker 0: You're just saving money that way.

134
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,640
Speaker 1: But now I live in New York, right?

135
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,610
Speaker 1: I don't have space for anything.

136
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,310
Speaker 0: But I learned that, A, I don't have a lot of space.

137
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:52,500
Speaker 1: And two, stuff goes bad.

138
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:53,267
Speaker 0: Stuff goes bad.

139
00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:02,150
Speaker 0: So really what happens is unless you use all of it before it expires or goes back, truly expires, not just date passes, right?

140
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,310
Speaker 0: You're losing money.

141
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:12,030
Speaker 0: If I spend 50 cents an ounce, right, for 20 ounces and I only use half of it.

142
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:13,956
Speaker 1: All right.

143
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:17,010
Speaker 1: What you're saying is a very old person conversation.

144
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,364
Speaker 1: That's all I'm saying here.

145
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:18,790
Speaker 0: Right.

146
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:21,349
Speaker 0: And the other one was 75 cents an ounce.

147
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,190
Speaker 0: But I buy twice, but the total price that I pay is less and I use all of it.

148
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:28,862
Speaker 0: I'm still paying total less money.

149
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:29,385
Speaker 0: Right.

150
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:34,310
Speaker 0: So I've been buying smaller things lately.

151
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,542
Speaker 0: So I tried to buy the smallest Yuzu paste.

152
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:37,790
Speaker 0: They didn't have a small one.

153
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,850
Speaker 0: The one I got is like, it's larger than any jar of jelly that you will see.

154
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,272
Speaker 0: It's larger.

155
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:43,340
Speaker 0: It was in the honey section.

156
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,870
Speaker 0: It was larger than any honey.

157
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:45,795
Speaker 1: You'll use it up.

158
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:46,682
Speaker 1: Just mix it with water.

159
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:47,609
Speaker 1: Like whenever you feel like it.

160
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:47,951
Speaker 1: Yeah.

161
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:59,685
Speaker 0: I mean, I figure I can, you know, considering that the lemonade that I would buy, which is simply brand lemonade, not promoting them, which is real good, is like three to four dollars for a half gallon.

162
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:00,690
Speaker 0: Right.

163
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,460
Speaker 0: And this is eight dollars.

164
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,870
Speaker 0: So I guess a gallon's worth of lemonade.

165
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:08,089
Speaker 0: It's like gallon lemonade.

166
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,189
Speaker 1: Now you could buy the simply and just mix Yuzu into it.

167
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,088
Speaker 0: I could do that, too.

168
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,349
Speaker 1: That might be too powerful, though.

169
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:14,033
Speaker 0: I'll try it.

170
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:21,947
Speaker 0: But yeah, per gallon, if I just do water, the eight dollars for the jar is like a tremendous value.

171
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:22,370
Speaker 0: Right.

172
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,569
Speaker 1: So in some actual animation news, Aggretsuko, which was...

173
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,649
Speaker 0: I still got to watch season two.

174
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:30,329
Speaker 0: Season two is pretty good.

175
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:31,048
Speaker 0: I imagine.

176
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:38,190
Speaker 1: However, I'm not going to spoil anything, but I think our main character made a terrible mistake.

177
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:40,030
Speaker 0: I'm sure that is what would happen.

178
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,529
Speaker 1: And chose a life that will not be as good.

179
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:45,029
Speaker 0: Well, is that why your news is happening?

180
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:54,910
Speaker 1: So my news is Aggretsuko is getting a third season, which is interesting because apparently the director has already said that, quote, he squeezed everything.

181
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,949
Speaker 1: He squeezed out everything he could into the first two seasons to the point that he insisted there's nothing left to say.

182
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:11,310
Speaker 1: So basically, Netflix is making is getting a third season of Aggretsuko made, even though no one on the production team is really ready to make a third season.

183
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,581
Speaker 1: So they're just going to phone it in?

184
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:14,814
Speaker 1: Well, no.

185
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:16,790
Speaker 1: I mean, he said, we look forward to working on it.

186
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,400
Speaker 1: They're excited.

187
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:17,848
Speaker 1: They're eager.

188
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:19,287
Speaker 1: I mean, you got to say that.

189
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:29,310
Speaker 1: But what's extra interesting is that we've seen some recent data showing that Netflix really only benefits from two seasons of anything.

190
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,230
Speaker 1: Like one season of something will drive subscriptions.

191
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,530
Speaker 1: Two seasons shows commitment and also drive subscriptions.

192
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,950
Speaker 1: More seasons of shows have no effect.

193
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:41,870
Speaker 1: Like might as well not even bother.

194
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,087
Speaker 1: So the fact that...

195
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:46,425
Speaker 0: Well, does it keep people who like if...

196
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,450
Speaker 1: No, the evidence, the stuff I read said that two seasons is all you need from any intellectual property.

197
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,770
Speaker 0: Season one got someone to subscribe to watch that show.

198
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:56,728
Speaker 1: Season two kept him.

199
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,789
Speaker 0: Season two kept him.

200
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,188
Speaker 0: And then after season two, if you don't make a season three, isn't that person going to unsub unless you have something else to watch?

201
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:08,890
Speaker 1: No, apparently like third seasons don't seem to have any statistical impact on subscribers, but the second season has a big impact.

202
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,469
Speaker 1: So there's a bunch of people talking about this.

203
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:15,170
Speaker 0: I'm probably going to unsub from Netflix soon because I'm not watching anything.

204
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:16,770
Speaker 1: I'm watching a lot of Netflix.

205
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:25,830
Speaker 1: And actually, you might not want to unsub because Megumi Hajibara has just joined the cast of Carol and Tuesday.

206
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,293
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

207
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:27,409
Speaker 0: That was the show I wanted to watch.

208
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Watson Abe show.

209
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,590
Speaker 0: I don't care about her being on the show, but... Netflix... I was waiting for that show to appear on Netflix.

210
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,450
Speaker 1: And Netflix is the international distributor.

211
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:38,490
Speaker 1: The show drops on Netflix for us on August 30th.

212
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,469
Speaker 0: That's real soon.

213
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,309
Speaker 0: I'll watch it after PAX.

214
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:41,967
Speaker 1: After PAX.

215
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,069
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll watch one episode on the plane to PAX.

216
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,029
Speaker 0: That is one thing.

217
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:52,150
Speaker 0: I don't really care which streaming place gets a show, but if Crunchyroll gets it, you're getting that simulcast biz most of the time.

218
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:57,150
Speaker 0: And Netflix waits till the whole thing's over and takes their sweet ass time.

219
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:59,610
Speaker 1: Carol and Tuesday is a show we mentioned in Judging Anime.

220
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,410
Speaker 1: We are like, this show has all the harbingers of being great.

221
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:06,169
Speaker 1: It's a Watson Abe show.

222
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:07,990
Speaker 1: It's got good character design.

223
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,010
Speaker 1: The plot is very much up our alley.

224
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,769
Speaker 1: And it's very interesting that Mugumi Hajibara is joining.

225
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:21,450
Speaker 1: And in the 16th episode, she will appear as a singer who has been knocked out of singing as a career due to the AIs.

226
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,510
Speaker 0: Okay.

227
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,570
Speaker 1: So she's playing a singer.

228
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,549
Speaker 1: That's the kind of role she has always done.

229
00:10:27,555 --> 00:10:28,229
Speaker 1: This will be fun.

230
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,130
Speaker 1: So maybe you're going to keep your Netflix a little longer.

231
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:32,630
Speaker 0: Maybe I will keep my Netflix.

232
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:43,649
Speaker 0: And related news is that Disney, they announced that for like 12 or 13 bucks, which is cheaper than Netflix, right, you're going to get Disney and Hulu and something else.

233
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,089
Speaker 0: Disney owns Hulu.

234
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,030
Speaker 1: Because I would never watch ESPN and I would never watch Hulu.

235
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,270
Speaker 0: Well, it depends what's on there.

236
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:57,130
Speaker 0: But the point is, is that this is a typical loss leader to try to take the market situation, right?

237
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,469
Speaker 0: It's like a lot of people who want this anyway so they can watch Marvel stuff and Disney stuff.

238
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:03,609
Speaker 0: Because Disney owns everything these days.

239
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:06,210
Speaker 0: So people want it anyway.

240
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,070
Speaker 0: They'll have a lower price than Netflix.

241
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,790
Speaker 0: People will cancel Netflix, get this.

242
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,690
Speaker 0: I probably will at some point, right?

243
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:17,787
Speaker 0: And then as soon as they get tons and tons of subscribers, then they'll jack the price up.

244
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,095
Speaker 0: Yup.

245
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,589
Speaker 0: So enjoy it while it's cheap.

246
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:29,110
Speaker 1: Yup, I will enjoy it because as you may have seen, Emily and I have been doing a show where we are going through the entire Disney theatrical animated canon.

247
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,029
Speaker 0: You think they're going to have that on the service?

248
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:33,488
Speaker 1: I mean, I think they're going to have every Disney movie on it.

249
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,309
Speaker 1: Pretty sure that's the direction they're going to go.

250
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:48,610
Speaker 1: And if they don't, I mean, I already have means to acquire every Disney animated movie if I so need, as I may have done for Snow White.

251
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:50,219
Speaker 0: Yar.

252
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:50,866
Speaker 1: Yar.

253
00:11:51,415 --> 00:11:52,050
Speaker 1: Yar indeed.

254
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:56,429
Speaker 1: So you had some animation news.

255
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,630
Speaker 0: Oh, I mean, this isn't a very big news, but I guess Rim's News was also a season three.

256
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,165
Speaker 0: So my news is a season two.

257
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,750
Speaker 0: Bananya is getting season two.

258
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,270
Speaker 1: We've talked about Bananya.

259
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,050
Speaker 0: So if you don't know, Bananya is just one of those like cute nothing shows.

260
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,190
Speaker 1: Pusheen adjacent.

261
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:20,530
Speaker 0: And basically it's just a really short episodes of this banana with a cat in it.

262
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,949
Speaker 0: And there's a few different bananas with cats in them living in a house.

263
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,050
Speaker 1: You could say there is a bunch of bananas with cats in them.

264
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:28,069
Speaker 0: It's closer to Mamishiba, the bean dogs.

265
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:28,508
Speaker 0: Yeah.

266
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,488
Speaker 0: This is banana cats.

267
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,730
Speaker 0: It's a food plus animal situation.

268
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,808
Speaker 0: So there was a season of it.

269
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:43,130
Speaker 0: And that season, the English dub, the narrator, who's pretty much the only voice in the show, the part was played by our friend Mike Tool.

270
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:44,309
Speaker 0: And he did a great job.

271
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:51,709
Speaker 0: And there's basically since that one season of Bananya, Bananya has stayed alive via merch.

272
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,429
Speaker 0: There's just lots of Bananya merch.

273
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:59,806
Speaker 0: The Crunchyroll booth at various conventions has set up a Bananya like swimming pool where they fill it with Bananya plushies.

274
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:03,009
Speaker 1: Every time there's a con, I see certain people tweeting about that.

275
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:03,630
Speaker 0: Yeah.

276
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,909
Speaker 0: To see that there's actually more Bananya coming is like, wow, really?

277
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:15,688
Speaker 0: And judging by the poster, they're making a lot more Bananya to make merch of.

278
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:20,268
Speaker 0: And they just need to make the show, I guess, for whatever reason.

279
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:26,010
Speaker 0: So speaking of multiple seasons, She-Ra season- Is that all the news we got?

280
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,210
Speaker 0: Is new seasons of everything.

281
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,250
Speaker 1: So She-Ra season three drops.

282
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,310
Speaker 0: What else has gotten a new season?

283
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:35,429
Speaker 1: And what I will say about that is one, She-Ra is a fantastic kid's show, but it is a kid's show.

284
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:39,430
Speaker 1: Like you watch season one and it's enjoyable, but it is clearly a kid's show.

285
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,229
Speaker 1: The animation is not great, even though the character designs are.

286
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,950
Speaker 1: The voice acting is fantastic.

287
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,110
Speaker 1: But as of season three, the show has actually really stepped up its game.

288
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:51,409
Speaker 1: The plot's gotten a lot more complex.

289
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:54,870
Speaker 1: The plot's gotten a lot more focused on precursor technology.

290
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,630
Speaker 0: That's what happens in kid's shows, because think about it.

291
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,950
Speaker 0: When did season one of this come out?

292
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,609
Speaker 0: How many years ago?

293
00:13:58,932 --> 00:13:59,270
Speaker 1: Not a lot.

294
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:01,009
Speaker 1: One year ago, two.

295
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,359
Speaker 0: Not long.

296
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:02,190
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, really?

297
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,470
Speaker 1: This is not like Adventure Time, where the character grew at the age of its fans.

298
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,370
Speaker 0: I'm just saying the fans are a year older, which in kids being one year older does make a big difference.

299
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,710
Speaker 0: A six year old is different than a five year old by a lot, right?

300
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:30,390
Speaker 1: But season three has introduced a lot of interesting romantic pairings between characters, a lot of characters switching sides, a surprising amount of nuance, and based on where it's gone, She-Ra's turning into a pretty good show.

301
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:34,030
Speaker 1: So if you are not on the She-Ra train, there aren't that many episodes.

302
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,210
Speaker 1: It's all just on Netflix.

303
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,128
Speaker 1: You can just watch it.

304
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:42,930
Speaker 1: And in season three, you will see some characters paired up in a romantic way that you never would have expected.

305
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:46,069
Speaker 1: Also, the show's covering a lot of ground, like season three.

306
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:46,690
Speaker 0: Y'all turn human.

307
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,749
Speaker 0: Getting the bone on.

308
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:55,450
Speaker 1: So I just want to point out that based on where She-Ra has gone, Skeletor is definitely canonically connected to this universe.

309
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,169
Speaker 0: I mean, yes.

310
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,510
Speaker 1: The one time Skeletor and Hordak worked together.

311
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,810
Speaker 1: The one time.

312
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:07,670
Speaker 0: I just want to see some, if you're going to get sexy action in the Masters of the Universe universe, I want to see some Modulock involved.

313
00:15:08,712 --> 00:15:09,769
Speaker 1: That's my guy.

314
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:14,809
Speaker 1: That is the second best answer to that, because the best answer is, as always, Fisto.

315
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,487
Speaker 0: Mossman.

316
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,968
Speaker 1: Stinkor and Fisto together at last.

317
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,889
Speaker 0: Now, if you don't know what Modulock is, Google it.

318
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,165
Speaker 0: M-O-D-U-L-O-C-K-K?

319
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:26,360
Speaker 0: I don't know.

320
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,848
Speaker 0: Do you know, I have a Modulock that I played with when I was a kid that I had.

321
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:33,830
Speaker 1: I had battle damage He-Man and battle damage Skeletor.

322
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:40,630
Speaker 0: One time I was at Scott Johnson's house and I found in a closet somewhere an unopened Modulock and I was like, what the fuck is this doing here?

323
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:43,468
Speaker 0: I'm just going to steal this and play with it.

324
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:50,730
Speaker 1: Of course, now we learn from that guy in Millerton that those toys, if you play with them, will just shatter.

325
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,024
Speaker 0: Well, Modulock was a very sturdy toy.

326
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:53,790
Speaker 0: He's not going to shatter.

327
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,929
Speaker 0: But Modulock mint in vox, Scott Johnson, hook me up.

328
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,428
Speaker 1: I mean, Stinkor still stinks.

329
00:15:59,351 --> 00:15:59,708
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

330
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,002
Speaker 0: Does that Stinkor smell?

331
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,510
Speaker 0: Like, whenever I smell it on something else?

332
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,710
Speaker 1: All I think is, wow, that Stinkor.

333
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,070
Speaker 0: All I think of is that fuzzy green He-Man figure.

334
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:11,749
Speaker 1: God, Stinkor was disgusting.

335
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:13,549
Speaker 1: What a terrible idea.

336
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:22,990
Speaker 1: But anyway, so things of the day.

337
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,150
Speaker 1: One thing we can't say has more seasons is Adventure Time.

338
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:32,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, there was the Adventure Time trying to continue with the next season in comic book form.

339
00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:34,329
Speaker 1: And they put the kibosh on that.

340
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,589
Speaker 0: They kiboshed it before they even finished one season of it.

341
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,009
Speaker 0: But they are publishing a trade of that, what they did.

342
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:42,449
Speaker 0: And I'm waiting for it to show up.

343
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:46,470
Speaker 1: But Adventure Time is still a very important cultural touchstone.

344
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,230
Speaker 1: It's probably one of the more important animated television shows in history.

345
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,969
Speaker 1: I think Time will definitely be on my side with that.

346
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,310
Speaker 1: And the comedy is still like, they're going to milk this franchise for as much as it's worth.

347
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,669
Speaker 1: Like, merch will continue to come out.

348
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,450
Speaker 1: There's definitely a strategy of keeping it alive, even if they're not making more original content.

349
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,410
Speaker 0: I mean, there's plenty of stuff like that, right?

350
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,990
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, everything that we want.

351
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,398
Speaker 0: Is there a G.I.

352
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,790
Speaker 0: Joe TV show right now?

353
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:12,688
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

354
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,450
Speaker 1: Evangelion 4.444.4.4.

355
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,328
Speaker 1: This will never end.

356
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,770
Speaker 1: You cannot not merchandise.

357
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:27,428
Speaker 0: I mean, IDW, right, publishes comic books every month of like, My Little Pony, Ghostbusters, Star Trek, G.I.

358
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,081
Speaker 0: Joe, Transformers, right?

359
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,290
Speaker 0: It's like, all those properties all have comic books every single month, right?

360
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,010
Speaker 1: But I didn't notice until a little while ago what Cartoon Network has been doing.

361
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,609
Speaker 1: And they're only up to season seven on this.

362
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:41,110
Speaker 1: So they're gonna keep making these.

363
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,010
Speaker 1: But every month, they've released a short YouTube video.

364
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,330
Speaker 1: It's like two or three minutes.

365
00:17:45,854 --> 00:17:46,589
Speaker 1: And it's a song.

366
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:54,389
Speaker 1: And it literally just summarizes in production release order every single episode of Adventure Time, season by season.

367
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:59,788
Speaker 1: It was, one, remember way back when we talked about the end of Adventure Time and how you watched it again?

368
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:04,749
Speaker 1: And how season one really gets right into the thick of it.

369
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,530
Speaker 1: Like, way sooner than you might remember.

370
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,506
Speaker 0: Right, people keep saying like, "Oh no, season one's

371
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:08,750
Speaker 0: different.".

372
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,247
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

373
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,409
Speaker 1: Season one, it's like four episodes in.

374
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,190
Speaker 1: It is Adventure Time all the way.

375
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:16,709
Speaker 1: So, watching this really drives it home.

376
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:18,670
Speaker 1: And these videos are great.

377
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,449
Speaker 1: And you should just watch them all.

378
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,510
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to wait a little bit because they're doing one per month.

379
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,088
Speaker 1: They just did season seven, which is basically Hall of Egress, steaks, all that biz.

380
00:18:29,915 --> 00:18:31,890
Speaker 1: There are several more seasons that gotta make this for us.

381
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,130
Speaker 1: There'll be several more months.

382
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,790
Speaker 1: I'm gonna link to the playlist so you can remind yourself how utterly great Adventure Time is.

383
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,650
Speaker 1: And there were episodes I forgot.

384
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:42,707
Speaker 0: I watched all recently, so there aren't episodes I forgot.

385
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,870
Speaker 1: So, what do you got?

386
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,430
Speaker 0: So, usually I try to avoid doing K-pop things of the day because if you don't know, basically K-pop groups are coming.

387
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:56,510
Speaker 0: You know, the big ones come back once a month or so, but you know, every month there'll be one or two big ones coming out.

388
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:59,289
Speaker 0: But there are lots and lots of medium and small ones.

389
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,629
Speaker 0: Like, every single week there's new K-pop shit, new music videos.

390
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:14,486
Speaker 0: This is like how I don't use... Every week there are five major, not even counting the minor ones, major music shows on TV in Korea and all the K-pop groups perform on most of them.

391
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,300
Speaker 0: So, imagine if, like, you put out a song, right?

392
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:24,770
Speaker 0: You're a band and you put out a song and you have to go on five TV shows a week for X weeks promoting your song.

393
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:31,670
Speaker 1: So, Scott, basically has to have a rule like I do where I can't make Techamoon my thing of the day every week.

394
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,370
Speaker 0: Right, I could make K-pop my thing of the day every single episode and never run out of material.

395
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,089
Speaker 0: Can that just be "Gig Nuts Fridays," just K-pop?

396
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:47,427
Speaker 0: So, I had to limit it to special cases when some K-pop thing really stands out or is really out of the ordinary or has appeal to people who don't give a shit about K-pop.

397
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,630
Speaker 0: That's usually the main criteria.

398
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,550
Speaker 1: I clicked on Scott's link, I heard some drums, and my brain knew exactly what was going on with no other context.

399
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:56,090
Speaker 0: That's right.

400
00:19:56,471 --> 00:20:05,990
Speaker 0: So, my favorite K-pops are actually the ones where things are sort of wacky and stupid and sort of... But still high production value.

401
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:08,427
Speaker 1: It's still good, but it's weird.

402
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,646
Speaker 0: There are groups like Waluwari, who did the Kuna Matata, and Crayon Pop.

403
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,150
Speaker 0: We haven't heard from them in a long time.

404
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,108
Speaker 0: Orange Caramel, remember they did the sushi with the Catalina.

405
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,330
Speaker 0: Right, Norazo is very hot right now with their shower.

406
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,300
Speaker 0: Have you seen that?

407
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,810
Speaker 0: Did I show you that?

408
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, you showed us that.

409
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,630
Speaker 0: The shower, yeah.

410
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,710
Speaker 0: So, groups like that who are just doing things that are really insane.

411
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:31,290
Speaker 0: Like, a lot of people know Psy because he was just sort of silly and wacky.

412
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:36,469
Speaker 0: It's like, no, no, these are... Way to the closer to wackiness than Psy is.

413
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,690
Speaker 0: Psy is kind of normal compared to these groups.

414
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:48,060
Speaker 0: Anyway, I didn't know about this group until like this week basically because I was watching all... I just went... One of the music shows, I just watched all the performances, not 100% of them.

415
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:52,089
Speaker 0: I just went on YouTube and clicked on each one for a second, right?

416
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,110
Speaker 0: To see who they were.

417
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,969
Speaker 0: Like, who are these groups?

418
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:54,710
Speaker 0: What are they about?

419
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:55,307
Speaker 0: I don't know them.

420
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:58,219
Speaker 0: And there's this group called Donkeys, which I don't know.

421
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,988
Speaker 0: what the fuck is it supposed to be.

422
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:05,209
Speaker 0: It's like a pun on the English word of donkeys, but it's like D-O-N-G-K-I-Z.

423
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,469
Speaker 0: I don't fucking know what it means.

424
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,809
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's this boy group.

425
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,810
Speaker 0: I guess these are like high school, early college boys.

426
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,730
Speaker 0: Who knows how old they are?

427
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,342
Speaker 0: I don't fucking know.

428
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:16,930
Speaker 0: And their new song is called Blockbuster.

429
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,330
Speaker 0: It's like, all right, whatever.

430
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,550
Speaker 0: And I watch their stage on the show.

431
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:21,994
Speaker 0: They're on.

432
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:23,430
Speaker 0: one of the music shows is Inky Gyo.

433
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,748
Speaker 0: I watch their stage on Inky Gyo, and I see some ghosts floating around on the video screens.

434
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:35,980
Speaker 0: And then I hear some very familiar music, and they got some very homage stage costumes.

435
00:21:41,654 --> 00:21:45,969
Speaker 0: And then there's a surprise towards the end of their performance that I didn't see coming at all.

436
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,789
Speaker 0: So yeah, you can see that.

437
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:54,069
Speaker 0: And then their music video, it's like, yeah, this isn't even, this isn't like some special parody stage or something like that.

438
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,021
Speaker 0: This is the actual song.

439
00:21:56,242 --> 00:21:58,810
Speaker 0: that is like the title track on their new release.

440
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:00,649
Speaker 0: It is their actual song.

441
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:02,809
Speaker 0: Check it out.

442
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,207
Speaker 1: I mean, I thought my cup runneth over with Bustin, and now I've got this.

443
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,789
Speaker 0: Oh, send this to Neil.

444
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:10,470
Speaker 0: See what he thinks.

445
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:20,629
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is no longer the painful pages, but it is in fact the first novel, The Tale of Genji.

446
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,750
Speaker 0: First novel ever.

447
00:22:23,252 --> 00:22:25,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's about this guy named Genji.

448
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,668
Speaker 1: Might take us a while to get to this, not because-- It's a long book.

449
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,429
Speaker 0: Today's well-read it.

450
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,790
Speaker 0: I'm 60% done with this other book I'm reading once I finish, and that's a long book also.

451
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:38,990
Speaker 1: I'm still reading the book about Kentucky Bluegrass versus Bermuda Grass.

452
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:43,388
Speaker 0: Ooh, so once I'm done with that book, I'll start reading about Genji and see what their deal is.

453
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:53,730
Speaker 0: And also, we're reading the Penguin Deluxe unabridged Longo version of Tale of Genji, so that might make it take a while longer.

454
00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:01,870
Speaker 0: But at least, you know, I've been sticking with the Read on Kindle app instead of playing games on phone strategy for quite a while.

455
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:02,570
Speaker 1: It's a good strategy.

456
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,889
Speaker 0: I think it is stuck now.

457
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,829
Speaker 0: No more playing phone games.

458
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:11,509
Speaker 0: So that means once I do Read Tale of Genji, I will keep-- probably read it at a steady clip.

459
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:13,009
Speaker 0: It's just gonna take a while.

460
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:25,509
Speaker 1: Yep, and otherwise, coming up at the end of the month, actually, the day that that anime we were talking about, Carolyn Tuesday, drops on Netflix, is the day we will do our first of two panels, at PAX West.

461
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,998
Speaker 1: It's on Friday, 1230

462
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:27,038
Speaker 1: p.m.,

463
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,100
Speaker 1: then on Saturday, 11

464
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,140
Speaker 1: a.m.,

465
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:32,870
Speaker 1: and then we're just gonna be playing games and hanging out in Seattle.

466
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,569
Speaker 1: It's gonna be awesome.

467
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,116
Speaker 1: Yep.

468
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,449
Speaker 1: PAX South is coming up.

469
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:36,949
Speaker 1: I hope you bought your badges.

470
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,469
Speaker 1: PAX Unplugged is coming up.

471
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,448
Speaker 1: I hope you're ready for this.

472
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:46,630
Speaker 1: And it's basically gonna be convention season all the way up until PAX East again, which ends our convention season.

473
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,610
Speaker 0: At least there's a big gap between PAX South and PAX East.

474
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:52,350
Speaker 1: That's our biggest gap before the summer.

475
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:58,610
Speaker 0: But they say that PAX East is coming early, which actually just means that off-season will be super long between East and West next year.

476
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,490
Speaker 1: Maybe we should go to, like, a con we normally wouldn't go to in that gap.

477
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,930
Speaker 1: Do, like, anime next or something.

478
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:08,330
Speaker 1: Haven't done an anime con in a long time.

479
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,569
Speaker 0: Maybe we could pick a different one than that.

480
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:10,025
Speaker 1: Yeah.

481
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,649
Speaker 1: Anime Boston is just too cold and I don't wanna go to Boston again.

482
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,290
Speaker 0: Well said.

483
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:25,250
Speaker 1: So, many of you who have been anime fans and manga fans for a long time may have had the original American release of the Urusayatsura manga.

484
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,589
Speaker 1: It was these big, big books that the binding just fell apart.

485
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,470
Speaker 1: Like, that's whatever, like, literally just disintegrated.

486
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,489
Speaker 0: It was released in the United States.

487
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:35,749
Speaker 0: So was the anime.

488
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:40,070
Speaker 0: AnimeEgo put out all the DVDs, including the movies, except for one movie.

489
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:40,789
Speaker 0: Except for one.

490
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,009
Speaker 0: That was put out by someone else.

491
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,229
Speaker 1: Beautiful Dreamer, which I have, like, eight copies of.

492
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:51,050
Speaker 0: So, you may recognize that anime girl with, like, the yellow, black, leopard kind of bikini.

493
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,310
Speaker 1: Leopard, tiger stripe.

494
00:24:52,513 --> 00:24:53,123
Speaker 0: Whatever it is.

495
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,049
Speaker 1: It's not a leopard.

496
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,130
Speaker 1: What do you even think a leopard looks like?

497
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,450
Speaker 0: Cat stripe, whatever.

498
00:24:57,692 --> 00:24:57,969
Speaker 0: Tiger.

499
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:58,950
Speaker 0: Clothing, whatever.

500
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:06,110
Speaker 1: The point is- The girl in the tiger bikini with the tiny horns and the electricity and the lecherous boyfriend and the cast of idiots.

501
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:12,727
Speaker 0: It's like, you've seen that chara- A lot of people have seen that character and recognize it as like, "Oh, yeah, anime bikini girl with the horn,

502
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:13,109
Speaker 0: whatever.".

503
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:15,250
Speaker 0: And they might know the character's name is Lum.

504
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,030
Speaker 1: Kind of like how people knew, uh, saw Mettalu, but didn't really know anything about Leiji Matsumoto.

505
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,138
Speaker 1: Right.

506
00:25:20,992 --> 00:25:27,869
Speaker 0: And if you recognize that character, maybe if you're higher level, you'll know that it's from a manga slash anime called Urusayatsura.

507
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:35,150
Speaker 0: And if you know that, you'll know that it was the original manga, was made by Rubiko Takahashi, who made Ranma One-Head.

508
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:35,790
Speaker 0: Yup.

509
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,587
Speaker 0: Inuyasha.

510
00:25:37,012 --> 00:25:38,569
Speaker 1: I still think this is her best work.

511
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,510
Speaker 0: Is this her earliest?

512
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,290
Speaker 0: This came before the other ones, right?

513
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:42,540
Speaker 0: Yeah.

514
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,510
Speaker 0: If I'm not mistaken, I could be wrong.

515
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,450
Speaker 0: I think it came before Ranma, definitely before Inuyasha.

516
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:49,670
Speaker 1: Oh, Inuyasha was way later.

517
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:49,945
Speaker 1: Yeah.

518
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,570
Speaker 0: It might've come after Mermaid whatever.

519
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:54,209
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

520
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,410
Speaker 1: I always forget about that one.

521
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,187
Speaker 0: It might've also come after, um...

522
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,609
Speaker 1: I tried to read that, but it got kind of weird and boring.

523
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,948
Speaker 0: What's the one that starts with M?

524
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,309
Speaker 1: Mezani Goku?

525
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:02,602
Speaker 0: Yes.

526
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,579
Speaker 0: I think it comes after Mezani Goku.

527
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,148
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

528
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,020
Speaker 1: Mezani Goku is very nostalgic for me because that is a manga.

529
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,929
Speaker 1: I read the entirety of.

530
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,589
Speaker 1: In bookstores.

531
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:10,509
Speaker 1: In Walden books.

532
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,350
Speaker 0: Without buying a single volume.

533
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,170
Speaker 1: I never owned any of that manga.

534
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:22,423
Speaker 0: So anyway, if you weren't able to read those old-ass additions that Viz put out in late 90s, early 2000s...

535
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was her first serial.

536
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:26,205
Speaker 1: Okay.

537
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:27,329
Speaker 1: In Shonen Sunday.

538
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,928
Speaker 0: If you didn't read Urase Asura then, you didn't pirate it or anything like that...

539
00:26:32,252 --> 00:26:35,710
Speaker 1: And you didn't get a hold of one of these disintegrating books, which are kind of hard to find.

540
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,020
Speaker 0: Right.

541
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:42,150
Speaker 0: They are now, somewhat recently, a few months ago, republishing it, Viz-Sig.

542
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,290
Speaker 1: We talked about this news less than a month ago.

543
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:45,444
Speaker 1: Right.

544
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:46,369
Speaker 0: Viz-Signature.

545
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:48,790
Speaker 0: They're putting out these mega volumes.

546
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:50,250
Speaker 0: I got the first one here.

547
00:26:50,372 --> 00:26:50,727
Speaker 0: I ordered it.

548
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,587
Speaker 0: I'm probably not going to buy any more because it's too big.

549
00:26:54,070 --> 00:27:00,089
Speaker 0: But I guess this one mega volume contains, I think, maybe two or three regular volumes combined into one book.

550
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:02,569
Speaker 0: So I don't know how many of these there are going to be total.

551
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:03,450
Speaker 0: How long is the manga?

552
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:04,569
Speaker 1: Really long.

553
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,249
Speaker 0: Really long.

554
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,149
Speaker 0: That's why I'm not going to start...

555
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:08,790
Speaker 1: I have not actually read all of it, though I do hope to someday.

556
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:12,370
Speaker 0: That's why I think I'm not going to read all of it unless it's digital or something.

557
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are thirty-four volumes from the original.

558
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,390
Speaker 0: Thirty-four divided by maybe three, so ten to eleven-ish books that are this big.

559
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:27,110
Speaker 1: So the thing is, I've read so much of the manga over the years that I don't actually know where this book you have leaves off.

560
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,190
Speaker 0: This book leaves off when... With the bird girl?

561
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:36,170
Speaker 0: Yes, a few chapters into the, like, Goblin Crow girl.

562
00:27:36,392 --> 00:27:39,326
Speaker 1: Okay, it pretty much lines up with the original book, then, I think.

563
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:39,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

564
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,630
Speaker 0: But anyway...

565
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,689
Speaker 1: Well, the original volume won.

566
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:48,189
Speaker 0: So I hadn't actually read it before, even though I had seen, like, one episode of anime and a movie and a half, maybe.

567
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:49,188
Speaker 0: Wow.

568
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:51,369
Speaker 1: I thought you'd seen more of the show.

569
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,570
Speaker 0: I have more of what I've seen.

570
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,850
Speaker 0: When have I read them?

571
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:58,169
Speaker 1: All I will say is that I have read this multiple times over the years.

572
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:00,030
Speaker 1: This is one of my favorite manga.

573
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,049
Speaker 0: So I read this full volume just now.

574
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:03,890
Speaker 1: We are just talking about the manga.

575
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:04,949
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, that's right.

576
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,170
Speaker 1: Because when you talk about the anime, you've got to talk about some more.

577
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,049
Speaker 1: You've got to talk about Oshii.

578
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,210
Speaker 1: Like, there's a lot of...

579
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,630
Speaker 0: Right, Mamoru Oshii comes in the anime.

580
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:11,790
Speaker 0: He has nothing to do with the manga.

581
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of interesting stories and context around the manga, or, sorry, the anime and the movies.

582
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,329
Speaker 1: We're just talking about the manga, the thing that started it all.

583
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:27,210
Speaker 0: So obviously, the first most interesting thing is that when you think of Araseatsuru, you look at this book, it's like the cover just has Lum on it, right?

584
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:30,390
Speaker 0: All merchandise, almost all of it has Lum on it, right?

585
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,628
Speaker 0: Almost any time the thing is mentioned, it's all about this character Lum.

586
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:34,609
Speaker 1: But the main character...

587
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,970
Speaker 0: But the actual manga... Is this... She is not the main character.

588
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,250
Speaker 0: She is a supporting character.

589
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:39,761
Speaker 0: It's this...

590
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:44,110
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say he's that shitty of a dude, because he's actually not really a bad person.

591
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:51,170
Speaker 1: He's just a little dumb, pretty lecherous, and he is basically the most unlucky human being on Earth.

592
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:51,742
Speaker 0: Right, that's the...

593
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,848
Speaker 1: Ataru Muramoshi.

594
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:58,610
Speaker 0: The real story is the dude Ataru, and the main plot is not... I mean, Lum is there.

595
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,250
Speaker 0: That's a main plot, right?

596
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,756
Speaker 0: But the main plot is just.

597
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:06,650
Speaker 0: he is the unluckiest person alive, and everything bad happens to him.

598
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,049
Speaker 0: And in fact, some of the early chapters don't even involve Lum.

599
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,850
Speaker 1: No, it's just him being an unlucky piece of shit.

600
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,570
Speaker 0: Right, and the character that no one... It's not in any merch, right?

601
00:29:16,894 --> 00:29:17,690
Speaker 0: The priest dude.

602
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:18,509
Speaker 0: What's his name?

603
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:20,009
Speaker 1: Oh, Sakurambo?

604
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:21,350
Speaker 1: I forget.

605
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,210
Speaker 0: They call him something in the manga.

606
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,100
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's an accurate translation, what they call him, right?

607
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:28,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sakurambo.

608
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:29,046
Speaker 0: Yeah.

609
00:29:29,452 --> 00:29:30,270
Speaker 0: I don't know what they call him.

610
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,030
Speaker 0: In the manga, I think they call him something different.

611
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:33,010
Speaker 1: Well, Cherry?

612
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it, right?

613
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:37,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, the manga translates a lot of the characters' names.

614
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:38,469
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

615
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:45,506
Speaker 0: But yeah, this Cherry Priest guy, basically he comes around all the time and is like, "Ataru, this bad shit is going to happen to you

616
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:45,889
Speaker 0: today.".

617
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:51,788
Speaker 0: And he's like... It's like you sort of get the feeling that this old man is causing the bad shit, like cursing him.

618
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,430
Speaker 1: But no, this old man is just... He's right.

619
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:03,689
Speaker 0: Right, but yeah, the old man is like... On the one hand, it's like a don't shoot the messenger situation, but the old man is also a villain in that he is the messenger of all this bad, unlucky news.

620
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,150
Speaker 1: Also, the old man is pretty lecherous and also kind of a piece of shit.

621
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:08,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, he's not good.

622
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:10,029
Speaker 0: Well, here's the important thing.

623
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,710
Speaker 0: He sort of gains pleasure in torturing Ataru, telling him about all the bad things that are going to happen.

624
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,078
Speaker 0: He's like...

625
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:19,070
Speaker 1: Almost no one in this manga is a particularly good person.

626
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,929
Speaker 0: The girl, what's her name?

627
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:23,210
Speaker 1: Sakura?

628
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:23,693
Speaker 0: No.

629
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,150
Speaker 1: The priest girl?

630
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:25,568
Speaker 0: Shinobu.

631
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,309
Speaker 1: Shinobu's got problems, though.

632
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,050
Speaker 0: All right, but she's mostly a good person.

633
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,530
Speaker 0: Compared to the other people, she's a saint.

634
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:31,960
Speaker 1: True.

635
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,810
Speaker 0: Also, like Ataru's mom, maybe.

636
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:38,562
Speaker 1: Oh, Ataru's mom is actually pretty neglectful of her son and is not that...

637
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:42,289
Speaker 0: She's not... But a lot of the other characters... She's not as bad as his dad.

638
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,667
Speaker 0: A lot of the other characters, though, are bad.

639
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:51,090
Speaker 0: They're like, you know, actively evil or lecherous or violent.

640
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,589
Speaker 1: Megane and all those idiots.

641
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:58,150
Speaker 1: You know, the capering idiots that follow Lum around that are kind of Ataru's friends, but not really.

642
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,390
Speaker 0: No, they're the three guys wearing blue from Mutana.

643
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,287
Speaker 0: That's who they are.

644
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,130
Speaker 1: No, they're way more prominent in later manga.

645
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:05,650
Speaker 0: All right.

646
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:08,790
Speaker 1: And they're like... I could talk a lot about their characters.

647
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,809
Speaker 1: Megane's the ringleader, the one with the glasses.

648
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,346
Speaker 0: Yes.

649
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,928
Speaker 1: The one who's really into Nazi stuff.

650
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:16,769
Speaker 0: Not in volume one, at least.

651
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, that comes up a lot later.

652
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,390
Speaker 1: I mean, he's the architect of the Third Reich Decadent Coffee Shop.

653
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:26,010
Speaker 1: He's just like a hyper-Japanese high school fanboy.

654
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,881
Speaker 0: Anyway...

655
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:32,330
Speaker 1: So the plot of the manga is... This story is basically... This dude is super unlucky.

656
00:31:32,872 --> 00:31:34,270
Speaker 1: He's friends with a bunch of idiots.

657
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,770
Speaker 1: He has a girlfriend, and they have an okay relationship.

658
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,147
Speaker 0: Right.

659
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,930
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, you know, she is into him, right?

660
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:49,808
Speaker 0: But she also gets really mad at him because he's so lecherous and will totally become infatuated with other ladies at the drop of a hat.

661
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:56,710
Speaker 0: It's sort of like... But at this other time, it's weird because on the one hand... I just read the last chapter in this one.

662
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:01,070
Speaker 0: There was some, like, you know, goblin... You know, there's a lot of supernatural stuff, right?

663
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,347
Speaker 0: Lum's an alien, right?

664
00:32:03,014 --> 00:32:04,429
Speaker 0: And there's the unlucky curses and shit.

665
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:12,985
Speaker 0: But he gets infatuated with, like, this goblin-like bird lady that he... He gets infatuated with... He kisses and wakes her up like Sleeping Beauty, right?

666
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,130
Speaker 0: And he's all into her, abandoning his girlfriend.

667
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:24,269
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, super hot Lum in chapter one, who's into him, and is like, "Oh, darling," you know, and wants him.

668
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:25,530
Speaker 0: He's not interested.

669
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:26,929
Speaker 0: He's, like, trying to get away from her.

670
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:33,548
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Dude, if you're, like, just a lecherous dude, why don't you just get with Lum, who wants you, and just be done with

671
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:33,669
Speaker 0: it?".

672
00:32:34,237 --> 00:32:34,970
Speaker 0: I don't understand that.

673
00:32:35,131 --> 00:32:35,467
Speaker 0: It's like...

674
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:38,050
Speaker 1: That's kind of the plot of the entire manga.

675
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:38,668
Speaker 0: Right, that is.

676
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:39,868
Speaker 0: It's like, he's...

677
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:47,065
Speaker 1: That's why the movies, like, the story arc of the movies is basically is like, "Yeah, Ataru, she's the one for you.

678
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:47,709
Speaker 1: Just admit

679
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:47,830
Speaker 1: it.".

680
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,270
Speaker 0: Right, on the one hand, he's trying to always get away from Lum to get with Shinobu.

681
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,910
Speaker 0: But he'll abandon Shinobu for other third or fourth ladies.

682
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:04,070
Speaker 1: But before Lum is in the picture, he is trying to get away from Shinobu sometimes to get with other random girls in the school.

683
00:33:04,972 --> 00:33:07,089
Speaker 1: But really, he always comes back home to Shinobu.

684
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,509
Speaker 1: Like, he's just a lecherous dude.

685
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,129
Speaker 0: But he'll run away from Lum, no matter what, to get to Shinobu.

686
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,229
Speaker 0: He's like, "No, Shinobu, Lum is just trying to...".

687
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,130
Speaker 0: You know, like, Lum will come in and, like, forcibly kiss him or whatever.

688
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:25,162
Speaker 0: So that, like, you know, and then, you know, when Shinobu can see, and then Shinobu will be like, "Ah, stop that.

689
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:25,947
Speaker 0: You're cheating on me.

690
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:26,108
Speaker 0: You're

691
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:26,389
Speaker 0: bad.".

692
00:33:26,591 --> 00:33:28,389
Speaker 0: And he's like, "No, I was being forced into

693
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:28,510
Speaker 0: it.".

694
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,028
Speaker 0: And he was.

695
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:37,370
Speaker 1: What I really love about this manga is that over time, because it's a long manga and a lot happens, but all of the main characters actually do really evolve and change.

696
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:40,429
Speaker 1: Like, Lum becomes a lot more reasonable over time.

697
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,210
Speaker 1: Like, Lum and Ataru's relationship slowly grows and becomes more nuanced and complex.

698
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,110
Speaker 1: Lum and Shinobu kind of become friends and, like, they're resigned to the fate of their situation.

699
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,321
Speaker 1: A lot of stuff happens.

700
00:33:52,684 --> 00:33:53,450
Speaker 1: Like, a lot.

701
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's weird, because, like, he's just reading this first, I guess, several volumes.

702
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,615
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

703
00:33:58,675 --> 00:33:59,602
Speaker 0: Covers a lot of ground.

704
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:05,430
Speaker 0: -It's, like, each chapter is just a really episodic thing where, like, there's a specific thing that's happening.

705
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:12,054
Speaker 0: that's, like, a conflict involving, you know, school or the town or... -It's always something... -...unlucky curses or a holiday... -The ludicrous.

706
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:16,370
Speaker 0: -...or a new character comes in and the chapter is about the conflict with that new character.

707
00:34:16,531 --> 00:34:19,810
Speaker 1: Like, they accidentally call a space cab and then they have to pay the cab.

708
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,469
Speaker 0: Right, or the transforming dude.

709
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,658
Speaker 0: -Oh, yeah.

710
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:23,969
Speaker 0: -You know, the dude, he doesn't talk.

711
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,109
Speaker 0: He just shows up and transforms like a giant bear, beast, whatever.

712
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:29,409
Speaker 1: That dude, his deal is that he is dumb as a brick.

713
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,358
Speaker 0: -He is not yet, right.

714
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:31,409
Speaker 1: -That is his character.

715
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:38,290
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's, like, each chapter is, like, an episodic thing, but at the same time, it's still developing.

716
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:45,690
Speaker 0: The overall character plot situation keeps going forward little by little, chapter by chapter, right?

717
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:48,085
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh, he managed to exercise

718
00:34:48,106 --> 00:34:48,286
Speaker 0: something.".

719
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,739
Speaker 0: -Or, you know...

720
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,306
Speaker 1: -Well, I guess...

721
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,005
Speaker 0: "Lum was in space, oh, but now she's back, and now she's

722
00:34:54,047 --> 00:34:54,369
Speaker 0: back.".

723
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,409
Speaker 0: And then, you know, all that kind of stuff.

724
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:02,930
Speaker 1: The Rumiko Takahashi works that I liked the most were the ones that basically, she'd have, like, a good cast of characters.

725
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:09,190
Speaker 1: Like, this manga, anything else you could say about it, this is a really good set of characters.

726
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,570
Speaker 1: It's a good ensemble cast.

727
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:20,027
Speaker 1: And you just take random ones, any given volume, throw them in a box, throw a weird situation, shake the box, -and just see what happens.

728
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:20,169
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

729
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,368
Speaker 1: -I love that kind of story.

730
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:22,549
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

731
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:28,028
Speaker 0: Also, there's, you know, a surprising amount of, like, -world-building kind of stuff going on.

732
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:28,149
Speaker 0: -Yeah!

733
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,428
Speaker 0: 'Cause, like, you know, an individual chapter will have something, -like, you just mentioned the space cab, right?

734
00:35:32,448 --> 00:35:32,589
Speaker 0: -Yep.

735
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:37,030
Speaker 0: But it's, like, what's the deal with what's going on in outer space?

736
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:42,730
Speaker 1: Well, 'cause it's sort of a story of Earth gets introduced to the rest of the universe because of this.

737
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:43,292
Speaker 0: Right.

738
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:51,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you don't realize, so chapter one, just summary, the very beginning, right, the ogre aliens show up, -the several kinds of aliens.

739
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,630
Speaker 1: -They're basically Oni, because Oni are actually just from space.

740
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,750
Speaker 0: Right, it seems like there's two sources of supernatural things.

741
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:04,369
Speaker 0: There's space, outer space, aliens, right, which apparently are way more advanced than Earth, and they come to Earth, finally.

742
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:12,690
Speaker 0: But there's also, basically, you know, Japanese folklore-type things, and, you know, Shinto spiritual-type things that are also real.

743
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,850
Speaker 0: And that's where, like, Cherry the priest comes in, right?

744
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:23,910
Speaker 0: So it's, like, both of those sources of supernatural, not real-world stuff enter the picture into most of the chapters, right?

745
00:36:24,651 --> 00:36:30,725
Speaker 0: But anyway, so the ogre aliens show up, and they're like, "Yeah, we're gonna destroy your Earth unless you beat us in a

746
00:36:30,786 --> 00:36:31,248
Speaker 0: challenge.".

747
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:32,950
Speaker 0: Same old story, right?

748
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,239
Speaker 0: And the challenge is, you know, someone has to play tag with Lum and-- -Touch your horns.

749
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:39,170
Speaker 0: -Right, touch your horns.

750
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,169
Speaker 0: And Ataru gets chosen because he's the unluckiest dude.

751
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:43,891
Speaker 1: Yup.

752
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:45,809
Speaker 1: He wants nothing to do with this.

753
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,310
Speaker 0: He doesn't want to have the fate of Earth on his shoulders.

754
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:58,390
Speaker 0: But, you know, he's determined to win, and somehow he doesn't like Lum, even though everyone else is way into her, and he's, like, the only hot girl he's not into.

755
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:05,930
Speaker 1: To be fair, Lum is a dangerous and annoying person in the early parts of the manga.

756
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,590
Speaker 0: Right, the main joke is that she keeps electrically shocking him, and somehow he survives.

757
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:17,570
Speaker 0: There's even, like, a little side note that talks about, like, how many times he's shocked, and how, like, he doesn't get hurt from that or something.

758
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:21,089
Speaker 0: It's, like, it's very strange.

759
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:32,050
Speaker 1: But it's just, it's a good balance of really funny, really weird, sometimes some, like, actually interesting sci-fi stuff, and often it's very heartwarming and charming.

760
00:37:33,553 --> 00:37:38,629
Speaker 0: So, it's, like, if you need, like, an everything manga, right, you can go for this.

761
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:38,991
Speaker 1: Yep.

762
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:43,210
Speaker 1: Also, it's got one of my favorite tropes, like, the same thing I like in, like, Patlabor.

763
00:37:44,152 --> 00:37:51,490
Speaker 1: All the background side characters are just, like, capering and doing their ridiculous bullshit in the background all the time.

764
00:37:52,012 --> 00:37:57,970
Speaker 1: I love, like, random scene of all the, like, the cat, the idiots are all having lunch together, complaining about Ataru.

765
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,429
Speaker 1: Like, those are some of my favorite bits.

766
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:05,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's, like, you get your, you know, you get romance, both, you know, comedy romance and real romance, right?

767
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:12,010
Speaker 0: You get comedy sort of like in, you get sort of like the wacky comedy, like, you get in, you know, City, Nichijou, right?

768
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,510
Speaker 0: We talked about that, right?

769
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,430
Speaker 0: You get your adventury stuff a little bit, right?

770
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:22,550
Speaker 1: Does this volume include when he has to go meet, like, actually, like, have dinner with Lum's parents?

771
00:38:23,892 --> 00:38:24,745
Speaker 0: Uh, maybe?

772
00:38:24,765 --> 00:38:25,090
Speaker 0: I forget.

773
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:26,623
Speaker 1: I forget what's in which volume.

774
00:38:26,663 --> 00:38:27,450
Speaker 1: I've read so much of this.

775
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's got adventury stuff, right?

776
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,350
Speaker 0: It's got, you know, some amount of school type stuff a little bit, right?

777
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:45,609
Speaker 0: It's got, you know, it's like, it's like literally everything, but it almost makes sense because it's focused on the characters and in human life, there's everything, right?

778
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:59,090
Speaker 0: And so rather than, you know, a lot of, you know, manga anime that focus on, say, adventure only, it's like you're getting all the aspects of the life of the supernaturally unluckiest person to ever live.

779
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,730
Speaker 1: And I cannot stress enough, it is just, it is really funny.

780
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,085
Speaker 1: Like, I laugh out loud reading this comic.

781
00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:07,750
Speaker 1: I always have.

782
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:12,510
Speaker 1: I have this weird urge to read it again even though I've read that first volume.

783
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:13,106
Speaker 1: Here you go.

784
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:14,309
Speaker 1: Many times.

785
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,990
Speaker 0: I can free up some space in my apartment.

786
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:18,670
Speaker 0: I'm not going to buy more volumes just because they're big.

787
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,729
Speaker 0: Not because I don't want to read it.

788
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:26,970
