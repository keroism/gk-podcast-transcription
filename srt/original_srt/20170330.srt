1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,832
Speaker 0: It's Thursday March 30th 2017.

2
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:15,800
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:19,670
Speaker 0: indoor lighting and possibly also outdoor lighting.

4
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:21,727
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:25,910
Speaker 0: So I got a little bit of a horror story that I happen to be on the subway yesterday.

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,014
Speaker 1: How hard could it be?

7
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:36,102
Speaker 0: Uh, so it was a situation that I had never conceived that I would be in and I was not sure how to extricate myself from it.

8
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,030
Speaker 1: I mean if you're honest you're on the subway.

9
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:40,823
Speaker 1: I was on the subway could push the red button and then you're good.

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:45,241
Speaker 0: the red button would have Potentially just made my situation worse.

11
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:47,570
Speaker 1: the it's the emergency to contact the conductor.

12
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:57,753
Speaker 0: So I've been taken the W home All right for a while now because the W runs a hybrid route where it goes by my office downtown and goes directly to my Apartment uptown.

13
00:00:57,853 --> 00:00:59,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, and because of the route it runs.

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,950
Speaker 0: No one rides it from that far downtown except me.

15
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:07,805
Speaker 0: I'm like on these empty cars But yesterday there were people on the train like there were.

16
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:08,950
Speaker 0: some people say I still got a seat.

17
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:13,863
Speaker 1: I always get to just sit down which I never sit on subway Even if I get an empty subway train and stand.

18
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:22,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it's a half-hour, you know I do I sit down and I'll play games on a portable console and soon I'm gonna start doing that with my switch.

19
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,940
Speaker 0: Cuz I can totally play Zelda.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,644
Speaker 1: I don't like him.

21
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:28,455
Speaker 1: I do not play Portably with my switch.

22
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:33,961
Speaker 0: I'm going to bring my switch on the W because I don't have to transfer trains And I mean your commutes a little too short for that.

23
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:37,479
Speaker 0: mine is exactly 30 minutes Which is like a perfect amount of time.

24
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:39,390
Speaker 0: do a little bit of like walking around.

25
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:41,878
Speaker 0: Bust up a camp of those boblin little guys.

26
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:43,183
Speaker 1: Well, you haven't got anywhere.

27
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:43,765
Speaker 1: Nope.

28
00:01:43,825 --> 00:01:45,150
Speaker 0: I was fighting the high knocks yesterday.

29
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,286
Speaker 0: I bumped into one of them.

30
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:48,318
Speaker 1: Tell me to see a line.

31
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,810
Speaker 1: Oh, I watched a Lionel's combat video today.

32
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,520
Speaker 0: I think I watched the same video.

33
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:58,429
Speaker 1: someone posted thing that were like Hey, this guy was beaten Lionel with basically tree branch and I'm like Jesus Christ.

34
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:04,950
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I got one really big ass sword that I save for like critical blow against scary.

35
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, that sword you you have you think is big ass is probably like a tree branch compared to what I.

36
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:12,913
Speaker 0: yeah So my my best sword has 38.

37
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:13,640
Speaker 1: It's not bad.

38
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:15,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Got swords.

39
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:21,490
Speaker 0: I literally just found it on the ground in a camp of like shitty moblins.

40
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got one that's like 50 something.

41
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:27,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a few special ones that are less than that but are like special ancient technology.

42
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:36,230
Speaker 1: the master sword is 30 But if you take it out sometimes it'll glow when you're like in a dungeon or around special areas.

43
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,678
Speaker 0: It's like a plus three or higher sword.

44
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,850
Speaker 1: It'll become like 70 because it's the master sword.

45
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:45,846
Speaker 1: Yeah, so like if you're fighting a bot again in boss with it, it's just like boom I am the good sword now.

46
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:52,310
Speaker 0: So, uh, I sit down and I always try to sit on the edge and not in the hobo.

47
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:53,915
Speaker 0: Hobo love seat.

48
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:54,338
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,505
Speaker 0: That's that's how you do in New York.

50
00:02:55,525 --> 00:03:03,451
Speaker 0: So I sit down and there is empty space next to me and then the bar like the vertical bar that kind of blocks people from sitting and then someone Else is sitting.

51
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:08,605
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm a person got on the train at the next stop and most of the seats are filling up.

52
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:13,536
Speaker 0: This person was Extremely large.

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,256
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and Just immediately Plop down next to me.

54
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:22,589
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm to the point that she was actually sitting on.

55
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:31,504
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, like her butt was on the subway seat But part of her overlapped over my entire right leg.

56
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:33,210
Speaker 1: It's a stand-up and get away.

57
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:39,090
Speaker 0: I was trapped by her like there was no way to actually stand up without shoving her out of the way.

58
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:49,090
Speaker 0: so I sat there for a minute just Thinking about if I force my way up or if I asked her to stand up so I can then stand up.

59
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:54,647
Speaker 1: So she can then sit down and say excuse me and I'm getting out and get up except I wasn't getting off.

60
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:57,529
Speaker 0: I had like 12 more stops to go.

61
00:03:57,853 --> 00:04:02,110
Speaker 0: I guess I could pull the game where I excuse me I'm getting off get off at the next stop and just walk to the next car.

62
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,193
Speaker 1: You just say excuse me.

63
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:05,801
Speaker 0: I'm getting up and get up and then just stand there.

64
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:14,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like that would be a. I Feel like the person may have taken that the wrong way or perhaps the right way.

65
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:15,875
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't.

66
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:17,361
Speaker 1: this is why I don't sit on the subway.

67
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,470
Speaker 1: Hey, yeah sitting can only bring you trouble.

68
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,630
Speaker 1: I never have trouble by standing elbowed.

69
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:26,746
Speaker 0: I've had mostly by odd people on the seven who really want to sit down even though I'm not.

70
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,400
Speaker 1: this is why I always Stand even if it's empty.

71
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:36,440
Speaker 0: you can never have trouble standing But like I had a dude through throw poop in my direction not not at me But like poopers thrown and I was nearby.

72
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,807
Speaker 1: like I've seen you standing.

73
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,795
Speaker 1: you dodge poop But I'm sitting and get pooped on.

74
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:47,925
Speaker 0: I've seen some shit in my life on the subway But I have never had someone literally just sit on me.

75
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:50,635
Speaker 0: Mmm, and then Stoneface it.

76
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:54,295
Speaker 0: Mmm, like I Was dumb.

77
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:57,170
Speaker 0: part of the reason why I sat there for me to try to figure out what to do is that was kind of dumb.

78
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,076
Speaker 1: Stand up cuz you shouldn't be sitting in the first place.

79
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:02,689
Speaker 0: I could not stand up without pushing her leg off of me do it.

80
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:07,424
Speaker 0: So eventually I tried to like make myself uncomfortable against her like I'd.

81
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:09,774
Speaker 0: basically I had my elbow out So I just move my.

82
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:10,861
Speaker 0: I just stand the fuck up.

83
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:12,290
Speaker 1: What's I couldn't you stand?

84
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,136
Speaker 1: Shover stand up.

85
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:18,530
Speaker 0: should I have shoved this lady say, excuse me I'm getting up and then just stand there and stare down.

86
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:20,099
Speaker 1: You don't have to stand in that spot.

87
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,689
Speaker 1: You can go stand in the other part of the car.

88
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:24,443
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would have been real obvious why I'd stood up though.

89
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:25,247
Speaker 1: It gives a shit.

90
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:28,264
Speaker 0: Yeah That's what happened to me on the subway.

91
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:29,210
Speaker 1: Okay?

92
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,489
Speaker 0: Did you have a better opening bid?

93
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,616
Speaker 1: No, but just stand the fuck up.

94
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:35,599
Speaker 1: It's your problem.

95
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,545
Speaker 1: Also don't sit in the first place.

96
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:38,187
Speaker 0: I'm not.

97
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:39,210
Speaker 1: you're young and healthy.

98
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:40,155
Speaker 0: Why not?

99
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,483
Speaker 0: I'm not taking a seat from anyone else.

100
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:42,650
Speaker 1: when you're an old man you can sit.

101
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:43,273
Speaker 0: Why like?

102
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:45,685
Speaker 0: why should I not sit on the subway if there's no one else in the subways?

103
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:46,770
Speaker 1: you run into problems like that.

104
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,618
Speaker 1: I'll see you sit all goddamn day at your desk.

105
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:50,084
Speaker 1: You take some time to stand.

106
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:52,197
Speaker 0: I was walking around a lot plus It's warm again.

107
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,750
Speaker 0: So I've resumed my thing my running thing.

108
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:59,729
Speaker 0: So I think I've told this to some listeners off and on because I've run into you and I've done this to you.

109
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:01,156
Speaker 0: But I have a policy.

110
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:03,790
Speaker 0: I've been following this for about five years now and it served me really well.

111
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:12,567
Speaker 0: if I'm ever by myself and I'm walking somewhere and I don't have a good reason not to good reasons being things like it's raining.

112
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:15,214
Speaker 0: I'm dressed up It's a crowded street.

113
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:16,799
Speaker 0: It's super dark out.

114
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:18,804
Speaker 0: I always run everywhere instead of walking.

115
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:23,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you're basically It's like a Kramer thing to do.

116
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:23,817
Speaker 0: It is.

117
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:25,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really is a Kramer kind of thing.

118
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:26,646
Speaker 1: That's like.

119
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:27,710
Speaker 1: that's what that is.

120
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,429
Speaker 0: But I've been doing it being that guy, but I've been doing it for a long time And it's warm enough to do that again.

121
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:35,150
Speaker 0: So I actually get a lot of exercise.

122
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,417

134
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,808
Speaker 0: I'm gonna link to our old episode about it.

135
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:34,288
Speaker 0: Just like it's fine to be tricked because someone like legit tricked you do not be tricked by the Internet.

136
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:40,426
Speaker 1: also Don't post stuff that's not even trying to trick people just like an obvious fake news.

137
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:41,370
Speaker 1: That shit is not funny.

138
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,890
Speaker 1: I've actually you know as like Google like what's the one they did that one time like pigeon something?

139
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,331
Speaker 1: It's like.

140
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,529
Speaker 1: those things not once have ever been funny or entertaining.

141
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:51,572
Speaker 1: They're all.

142
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:57,270
Speaker 0: it's gotta be like a legit trick like you go to a site and you read the news and you go what?

143
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,913
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

Speaker 0: So you accept it as real news and then you tell someone and they go Yup, I don't necessarily mind people who just do Generally interesting things like sweat web comics will do their swap and all that like.

150
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,390
Speaker 0: that's fine because it's not a prank.

151
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,279
Speaker 1: It's not like.

152
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,430
Speaker 0: it's not like a go-to-read.

153
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:35,044
Speaker 0: I don't know mega Tokyo and I'm like, oh my god I guess the penny arcade guys are in this comic now, huh?

154
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:35,424
Speaker 0: Like you're not.

155
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:37,903
Speaker 0: I'm not tricked by that but it's usually funny.

156
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:43,309
Speaker 0: I brought a mega Tokyo because Over the last weekend is it still exist?

157
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,679
Speaker 0: So I decided to play a game and the game was.

158
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,250
Speaker 0: I went to mega Tokyo and the comic was just updated.

159
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:49,936
Speaker 1: What's the latest update?

160
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:52,589
Speaker 1: Uh, so yeah, what does the website even look like today?

161
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,476
Speaker 0: It looks the same really.

162
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:55,982
Speaker 0: it even has the same relax.

163
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:56,605
Speaker 0: We understand you.

164
00:08:56,665 --> 00:08:57,067
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

165
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:57,890
Speaker 1: Oh, it does look the same.

166
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,652
Speaker 1: Okay, what's luck?

167
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:00,316
Speaker 0: What's the Stephen got Piero and guests?

168
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:01,038
Speaker 1: What's?

169
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:01,259
Speaker 1: so?

170
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,662
Speaker 1: what's the date on that comic strip?

171
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:07,537
Speaker 0: This comic went up a Couple days ago, really?

172
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,245
Speaker 1: So art looks the same though.

173
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:09,586
Speaker 1: It hasn't.

174
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:16,990
Speaker 0: as it improved Was to start clicking previous until I figured out what the fuck was happening.

175
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:22,030
Speaker 0: You had to start back when we you know, yeah, uh, not only I don't think the plot has gone anywhere.

176
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:23,384
Speaker 1: How many readers does this have?

177
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:23,849
Speaker 0: a lot?

178
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:30,613
Speaker 0: All I'm saying is that it doesn't look like it is beyond where it was when we were in our IT Mm-hmm.

179
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:36,170
Speaker 0: It looks like it is literally in that exact same part like Largo or whatever is still in the hospital.

180
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:41,430
Speaker 1: I mean, well, we know what the Piero in real life right the Piero guy we know what he's doing.

181
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,415
Speaker 1: He's making this comic.

182
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:44,244
Speaker 1: what happened to the Largo guy?

183
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, like his Rodney He like showed up at some cons for a while.

184
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:48,360
Speaker 0: He saw him.

185
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,250
Speaker 1: He was oh at least what little we knew of him.

186
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:59,430
Speaker 1: He was not the worst now a bad, dude I might be and I just don't know I interacted with him once on like minimal pleasantries.

187
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:05,490
Speaker 1: No, he was a nerdy person who was a you know, as far as I could tell a human being that wasn't painful to talk to.

188
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:06,814
Speaker 1: What happened to him?

189
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,617
Speaker 1: What is he doing now?

190
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:08,641
Speaker 1: I'm curious.

191
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:09,765
Speaker 0: I'm really curious here.

192
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,030
Speaker 1: Is he a disgusting person now?

193
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:12,749
Speaker 1: Is he just living a life?

194
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,271
Speaker 1: Is he?

195
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:14,074
Speaker 1: what's he doing cuz?

196
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:20,784
Speaker 0: maybe you might forget but I don't understand how fucking big that comic was back then in terms of The all of his six months.

197
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:24,256
Speaker 0: Yeah Years couple years is a big deal.

198
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,841
Speaker 0: couple years now.

199
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:26,222
Speaker 1: It's no.

200
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:30,187
Speaker 0: like it was bigger than penny arcade for a while Yeah, and now it's no deal.

201
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:33,590
Speaker 0: Yeah Well penny arcade kept growing and like look I keep hitting back.

202
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:37,206
Speaker 0: This might as this might as well be a strip from when we were at our IT.

203
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:38,865
Speaker 1: Yeah Looks the same.

204
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:40,754
Speaker 0: All right, you got any news.

205
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:45,670
Speaker 1: yeah, so the astronauts are doing the astronaut thing, I guess I don't know what day it is in space.

206
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:47,275
Speaker 1: How do you tell a day?

207
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,043
Speaker 1: it is in space and you're going around the earth the whole?

208
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:50,369
Speaker 0: but I guess you just pick a pick.

209
00:10:50,650 --> 00:11:01,393
Speaker 1: You pick just you just UTC whenever empty is just UTC if you're in space, I guess Oh anyway, but says oh here you go at 10 a.m 1400 GMT.

210
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,060
Speaker 1: Oh No 1400 GMT.

211
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,683
Speaker 0: so much space stuff.

212
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:07,979
Speaker 0: because I know there was the spacewalk that people were talking Did a spacewalk, which is they happens all the time.

213
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, they drop something.

214
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:21,249
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I saw the story about that and that's just hilarious for so even though it's all you know It's probably bad news or it's but it wasn't like such a bad news that like it they're gonna die But it's just like oh my god that drop something.

215
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,675
Speaker 1: well I think that's kind of funny.

216
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:28,850
Speaker 0: most of the work up there because you know things I've learned just because you know I follow space is that people who stay in space for any long amount of time?

217
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:31,618
Speaker 0: They get used to being in space.

218
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,510
Speaker 0: So they'll like you hand them a cup and then they get distracted.

219
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,910
Speaker 0: They'll just let go of the cup sploosh, right?

220
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,932
Speaker 1: Yeah But the point.

221
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:38,454
Speaker 1: so they were.

222
00:11:38,474 --> 00:11:46,810
Speaker 1: basically what happening was I think as far as I can tell they were moving a docking port Which is the port where you know ships connect to the space station, right?

223
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,049
Speaker 1: They're moving it and they since nothing was docked they had to like cover it up.

224
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:53,400
Speaker 1: So there's nothing would smash into it and mess it up.

225
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,610
Speaker 1: So they had like these basically pads.

226
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,906
Speaker 1: I think they're sort of described as like shields to put over it.

227
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:03,901
Speaker 1: and When you're installing stuff you basically have everything at all times.

228
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:13,390
Speaker 1: everything is I you're always keep yourself tied to the space stations You don't float away into space and you make sure that everything you're working with is tied to you or the space station.

229
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:22,818
Speaker 1: I did so I did and when you're gonna when you're you know You would say if you had a thing tied to you you would tie it to the space station then untie it from you Right afterwards.

230
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:24,529
Speaker 1: and that's how you you know.

231
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:29,930
Speaker 0: Anything like you can have like say you're messing with screws you can't just have a bowl of screws.

232
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:31,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't do that.

233
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:34,630
Speaker 0: when I was in space camp will face Academy cuz I did the older kid version of it.

234
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:41,449
Speaker 0: It's not actually but as a kid they made us do a lot of those kinds of exercises Which basically they put you in a suit that's super hard to move in.

235
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:41,890
Speaker 0: Yeah.

236
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:50,578
Speaker 0: And then they make you like alright Screw a light bulb into that thing climb up climb up this ladder and screw a light bulb into that thing and you immediately break The light bulb and you another one you break that one.

237
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:53,270
Speaker 0: They hand you another one you get up there and drop it immediately.

238
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:58,819
Speaker 1: But anyway So in the past astronauts have lost things like someone lost the whole toolkit.

239
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,144
Speaker 1: one someone lost a bolt.

240
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:02,540
Speaker 0: the toolkit was the first thing that came up when I googled for this.

241
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:06,220
Speaker 0: Yeah The article is quote spacewalkers lose piece of shielding.

242
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:08,610
Speaker 0: use MacGyver like plan for patch instead.

243
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:10,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically, it wasn't really MacGyver like pan.

244
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,830
Speaker 1: They just took whatever they had they the remaining shields.

245
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:19,541
Speaker 1: They shielded the most important bits and took some other stuff They had left over and shielded some other bits barely.

246
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:25,943
Speaker 1: and it's like, alright, you know You're not as long as nothing's like smashes into it that one spot unluckily.

247
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:28,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's gonna be fine, right.

248
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:36,209
Speaker 1: but It's just kind of funny to imagine someone in space and like they lose something and it floats away and you can't go get it.

249
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:43,910
Speaker 0: And it's just like fuck especially because imagine it's slowly moving away from you and it's just becomes this white spec.

250
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:47,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, you know, I drop stuff all the time, especially when I'm gaming.

251
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,710
Speaker 1: I'll drop pieces on the ground because I always fiddle with them and Like I just bend down and pick them up.

252
00:13:51,810 --> 00:14:01,802
Speaker 1: Imagine if like you're playing a game and you roll the dice and the dice go off the table and then just go off into space Just like a dice ain't come back You would be fucked in space.

253
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:04,940
Speaker 1: Yeah Got no dice left guys.

254
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,056
Speaker 1: We can't continue our space RPG so randomly.

255
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:11,085
Speaker 0: I got a geek bite instead of a news you go on.

256
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,070
Speaker 1: the moon is a bunch of dice.

257
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:18,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, because as much as I would love to talk about the fascinating things that are happening today in politics I know that Scott literally does not care.

258
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:22,682
Speaker 0: Some of you might but whatever I have a price there to say.

259
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:23,907
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a lot to say.

260
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:30,790
Speaker 0: I have a private Hangout with the small number of people I know who want to constantly talk about this.

261
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:35,409
Speaker 0: I'm getting it all out of my system in there and I actually just added a new person to that.

262
00:14:36,152 --> 00:14:37,817
Speaker 1: But it is bad the end.

263
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:46,930
Speaker 0: No, it's more like here's the specific and detailed way in that This particular shit is bad right now and how it is differently bad from how it was yesterday.

264
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:48,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've read that in the news.

265
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:49,889
Speaker 1: So I don't need to read rim writing it again.

266
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:52,181
Speaker 0: I don't think you read any of this in the news.

267
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:53,550
Speaker 1: I read a lot of things in the news.

268
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,635
Speaker 0: Did anything happen today?

269
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:57,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, like what we're not gonna talk about.

270
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,797
Speaker 1: I'm gonna talk about it cuz the.

271
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:08,820
Speaker 0: anyone else can also read the news to find out You name on a high level anything that happened today other than the NCAA slash North Carolina thing The ISVs fine thing.

272
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:12,617
Speaker 0: that didn't happen today When they have happened a couple days ago.

273
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,324
Speaker 1: very sure that was today when they voted.

274
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:15,590
Speaker 0: pretty sure they voted yesterday.

275
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:18,497
Speaker 1: It's still news today, that's old news.

276
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:19,620
Speaker 0: We already knew about that.

277
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:22,670
Speaker 1: Anyway, uh, anyway point is I read news.

278
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:23,215
Speaker 0: I'm gonna geek.

279
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:24,568
Speaker 1: I need you to read the news again.

280
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:32,415
Speaker 0: Multiple people told me to watch this show and multiple people told me not to watch this show, but it's an old show Not that old.

281
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:35,065
Speaker 0: I guess it's still going like 12 seasons.

282
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:40,410
Speaker 0: So going okay Okay, but it's always sunny in Philadelphia is a show that I just randomly was on that.

283
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,224
Speaker 1: Isn't that the show where the guy who wrote Seinfeld is on it?

284
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:44,109
Speaker 1: Like it's his show.

285
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,515
Speaker 1: So he's the main character.

286
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:51,410
Speaker 0: the thing most people know about is that Danny DeVito is just on it as a character.

287
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:54,347
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't know that hit and he's he's great in it.

288
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:57,662
Speaker 1: Okay Uh, I mean usually people who are great are great in anything.

289
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:58,727
Speaker 1: even don't think so.

290
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:03,849
Speaker 0: It was pretty great Yeah, but basically the deal with this show like I just watched it cuz I didn't really know a lot about it.

291
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:06,482
Speaker 0: Chase in particular always been bugging me to watch it.

292
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:08,010
Speaker 0: So I watched a bunch of it.

293
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:15,970
Speaker 0: That's his kind of thing because I was doing a lot of geek nights like video editing I was working on the pipeline for antenna and making those board game things and it's kind of mindless work.

294
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:24,941
Speaker 0: so I was actually watching this sitcom while I was doing that work because that work was just super mindless and The show was not quite what I expected.

295
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:26,709
Speaker 0: and I actually really enjoy it.

296
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:33,619
Speaker 0: But my geek bite review will be that you have to be a particular kind of person To actually like this show and I would I

297
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,772
Speaker 1: guess there's enough particular kind of people for it to go 12 seasons Yeah,

298
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:42,355
Speaker 0: so, you know Seinfeld the Seinfeld episode is basically You know the characters.

299
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:48,998
Speaker 0: like a premise starts like these characters are at a Chinese restaurant or they're gonna do a thing And then the whole episode will basically then just be that thing.

300
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:56,701
Speaker 0: Well, it's and it ends often with like the Crazy or exaggerated failure climax to that.

301
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:59,890
Speaker 1: I think the usual formula George's wife is dead now, right?

302
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:09,765
Speaker 1: but I mean the usual formula is you know, either individual or groups of characters have a thing going on and then Individual or group of characters have another thing going

303
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:10,368
Speaker 0: on in the B

304
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:15,290
Speaker 1: And then they there could be even three of these things and then at the end of the episode they all come together.

305
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:25,650
Speaker 0: But the important part is that it's mostly realistic normal Like that's how self-absorbed people in New York kind of are and then it just it escalates into like a crazy moment at the end.

306
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:36,970
Speaker 0: It's always sunny has almost the exact same structure except it starts at the crazy thing that happens at the very end of an episode of Seinfeld and just goes way beyond that.

307
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:46,392
Speaker 0: and Terms of crazy and ends like it's Seinfeld ending are things like literally the entire block burned down or those people are all dead Like.

308
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,117
Speaker 1: so it's about different people all the time.

309
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:48,599
Speaker 0: No, like.

310
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:50,003
Speaker 0: not the characters like other people.

311
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:52,430
Speaker 0: Okay, they've killed a whole family or something.

312
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:56,803
Speaker 0: Okay, but it's Seinfeld Ian in terms of how it all goes down.

313
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:58,047
Speaker 0: It's the same writing guy.

314
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:00,077
Speaker 1: It's just really Escalating.

315
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:03,937
Speaker 1: I can't remember the guy's name Rob Miguel McElhenny, no, not that guy.

316
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,000
Speaker 0: That's that's the creator.

317
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,622
Speaker 0: who's the other?

318
00:18:05,662 --> 00:18:08,050
Speaker 0: Blya Glenn Howerton and Rob McElhenny?

319
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,715
Speaker 1: No, that's not the guy I'm thinking of.

320
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,819
Speaker 0: who's starring Charlie Day.

321
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,984
Speaker 0: No, then Houghton.

322
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:16,560
Speaker 0: No, Rob McElhenny Caitlin Olson, who's the guy who wrote Danny DeVito?

323
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,005
Speaker 0: No, I don't actually know.

324
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:19,249
Speaker 0: you keep bringing this up.

325
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,275
Speaker 1: What's the guy's name?

326
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:21,503
Speaker 1: This is maybe he's not on the show.

327
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:23,700
Speaker 1: I'm thinking of a different show I'm looking for.

328
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,829
Speaker 0: I mean the writing team The answer to who the writer is for this is not trivial for me to give you a just a name.

329
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:32,685
Speaker 1: Well, then Larry David.

330
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:37,369
Speaker 1: that guy Maybe this is a different show than the one I was thinking of.

331
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:39,272
Speaker 0: It's very.

332
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,138
Speaker 0: David is not in any way involved in the show.

333
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:44,268
Speaker 1: What's the show that Larry David is on the Larry David show?

334
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:47,816
Speaker 1: No There's some other show that he had.

335
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:49,102
Speaker 1: that was I guess this.

336
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:49,765
Speaker 1: isn't that show?

337
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:50,990
Speaker 0: no, no, all right.

338
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,656
Speaker 0: Let's go to Larry David and Wikipedia.

339
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:54,242
Speaker 0: Let's see active to present.

340
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:56,570
Speaker 0: What's he working on right now or recently ish?

341
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,798
Speaker 0: I mean, there's curb your enthusiasm.

342
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,685
Speaker 1: Oh, is that the show that was thinking of?

343
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,030
Speaker 0: that's the show you're thinking of.

344
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,669
Speaker 1: I don't watch TV in America.

345
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:12,703
Speaker 0: Okay As little as I know about TV in America I'm actually shocked at how little you know about TV in America.

346
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:14,390
Speaker 1: I don't watch garbage American television.

347
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:19,493
Speaker 0: I think you might actually like it's always sunny because Seinfeld.

348
00:19:19,673 --> 00:19:29,510
Speaker 0: a lot of the problems with rewatching Seinfeld today is that Some of the left tracks laugh tracks and sometimes its jokes are a little bit dated or not quite as like this.

349
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:43,472
Speaker 0: yeah, uh but the but this show these people are horrible people and the plots but I don't like that begin are Amazing.

350
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:44,256
Speaker 0: one of them.

351
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:56,548
Speaker 0: so to the characters come into like the bar that they own I guess and they're having an argument over who shit the bed and What the fuck are you talking about?

352
00:19:56,568 --> 00:20:01,483
Speaker 0: and they reveal that the two of them share an apartment and they share a bed.

353
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:03,228
Speaker 0: because why are you gonna pay for two beds?

354
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,075
Speaker 0: and The other characters are like, okay, that's weird but go on.

355
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:15,579
Speaker 0: and they woke up one morning and There was a poop between them and neither one would claim that they were at fault Mm-hmm.

356
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,645
Speaker 1: So someone put the poop there.

357
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:17,409
Speaker 1: It wasn't either of them.

358
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:21,710
Speaker 0: So the other characters agree that this is a mystery that's worth DNA test.

359
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:32,680
Speaker 0: so they yeah, they take it to a they take it somewhere like to the police to have them examine it and that goes about as well as you'd expect because Everyone who is not these characters is a perfectly normal human being.

360
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,346
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm much like Seinfeld.

361
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:38,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, so They agree to stay the night and watch them.

362
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:44,476
Speaker 0: Seinfeld has some not normal non main characters Yeah but they were still within the realm of like.

363
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,405
Speaker 0: I've known people who were like in those the same archetype.

364
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:51,639
Speaker 0: you knew soup Nazis and I've known people who were that archetype kind of humans.

365
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:53,506
Speaker 0: I know some fucking Newman's.

366
00:20:53,526 --> 00:20:55,859
Speaker 0: I Know some Newman's.

367
00:20:56,342 --> 00:21:03,110
Speaker 0: I would argue that One of the unnamed people from our IT who shall not be named edged real close to being a legit Newman.

368
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:07,305
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a those people at our IT guy the guy with the merged earlobe.

369
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,290
Speaker 1: I Know people at our IT who looked a hell of a lot like Newman.

370
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:15,363
Speaker 0: I also acted like Newman but did not act like him and we've treated him with.

371
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:17,370
Speaker 0: we gave him the Newman like oh, hello.

372
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:21,889
Speaker 0: Anyway, I enjoy this show.

373
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:31,686
Speaker 0: You need to really be okay with watching the show where really horrible people go through a Seinfeldian nightmare from start to finish.

374
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:47,469
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the day I Literally, this was just recommended to me on YouTube and it's real catching us tuck in my head Diva Miru.

375
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:57,790
Speaker 0: It's just a Video that someone made where they took all the words that Diva says in overwatch and Autotune them and mix them into a cute and catchy song with a video.

376
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:02,524
Speaker 1: Why don't we do the same thing with all the sounds people making counter-strike circle around back?

377
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:05,311
Speaker 0: Ah, we could do that With.

378
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:06,615
Speaker 0: that is definitely something we do.

379
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:10,687
Speaker 0: I'll go right in the hopper go go go go go go go go go go go.

380
00:22:12,492 --> 00:22:14,102
Speaker 0: Actually that just turns right into gotta go fast.

381
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:15,330
Speaker 0: You can mix those together anyway.

382
00:22:15,931 --> 00:22:25,290
Speaker 0: Anyway, but after I liked this video and decided was my thing of the day I realized Way after that the YouTube account it's on is piece of sheets.

383
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,499

385
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:30,772
Speaker 0: It was a heart stone thing I'm pretty sure.

386
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:32,419
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe it was so.

391
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:51,304

Speaker 1: Well, we have like five thousand So everyone go check out a piece of sheet.

396
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:03,549
Speaker 1: Yeah So what do you got so?

397
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:09,025
Speaker 1: You know usually and you get situations the kids are involved and adults mixing.

398
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:13,084
Speaker 1: in a competitive environment Adults tend to go easy on them, right?

399
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:15,012
Speaker 0: or it's like that game of tag We played.

400
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:24,270
Speaker 1: you know, there's that famous South Park episode where they play hockey against the Red Wings And the Red Wings play like their kids are an NHL team and just beat the shit out of them.

401
00:23:25,251 --> 00:23:27,041
Speaker 1: Right, and that doesn't actually happen in real life.

402
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:28,730
Speaker 1: That's why it's funny on South Park, right?

403
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:38,566
Speaker 1: You know in real life if there's like an adult kids t-ball game like the adults sort of soft Toss it or they're like, you know barely hit the ball so the kids can feel the.

404
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:39,610
Speaker 1: you know, that's how you do.

405
00:23:40,113 --> 00:23:42,090
Speaker 1: Well, apparently there's some sort of event.

406
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:58,924
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what event this is, but it happens enough times that there's a whole bunch of videos of it that were edited together where professional mascots from NFL teams and I think college football teams Play football against what appeared to be high school football players.

407
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:00,408
Speaker 1: Clearly not college football players.

408
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:05,029
Speaker 1: Yeah and Nobody is holding back here.

409
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:15,630
Speaker 1: And those mascots clearly have you know Professional mascots are athletic adults usually because they can do flips and they can wear that suit for a long period of time and jump.

410
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:23,485
Speaker 1: And you know, I mean, I guess the gorilla from the Phoenix Suns is the best of all in terms of athleticism But I guess he's not playing football the gorilla.

411
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,208
Speaker 1: Yeah but anyway.

412
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:37,053
Speaker 1: So yeah in this video It's a bunch of clips from these mascot versus kids games and the mascots play football like they're trying to win and it is Glorious.

413
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:39,563
Speaker 1: and you said how is this allowed to continue?

414
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:41,636
Speaker 0: I've not even watched this yet But I just see.

415
00:24:41,677 --> 00:24:46,526
Speaker 1: but as long as it exists I'm not gonna deny myself the joy of watching it, but they should probably stop doing this.

416
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:47,470
Speaker 0: I just see the thumbnail.

417
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:53,574
Speaker 0: I just see this kid who looks like he's about to get wrecked and it just says mascots destroying kids Compilation.

418
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:53,915
Speaker 1: yeah, there's.

419
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:58,030
Speaker 1: do not destroy the kids anymore, please, but do watch this video.

420
00:24:58,151 --> 00:24:59,076
Speaker 1: So at least they would not.

421
00:24:59,116 --> 00:25:01,450
Speaker 1: the ones that have already been destroyed were not destroyed in vain.

422
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,120
Speaker 1: They can provide joy to the rest of us.

423
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,650
Speaker 0: We can treat it like hockey fights.

424
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:10,490
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm glad hockey fighting is not as much of a thing and I hope it eventually Would have been even better if it was never a thing.

425
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:19,350
Speaker 0: But because it was a thing and we have video of it we can enjoy from old videos There is enough video of it to where I can satisfy my need to see hockey fights for the rest of my life.

426
00:25:19,772 --> 00:25:21,161
Speaker 1: I was actually thinking the other day.

427
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:26,110
Speaker 1: It's like there's a hockey fight Why don't they just like arrest them and put them in jail for us like assault or something?

428
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,646
Speaker 0: I mean some sports they would like depending on the nature of the fight.

429
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:36,888
Speaker 1: Like if you're in a Fight within the this month where there was like, you know blood on people's faces and shit.

430
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:39,429
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I think I was watching that game.

431
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,190
Speaker 0: Answer was like this is some old-timey hockey going on right here?

432
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:51,950
Speaker 1: They just go to jail and if they Know cuz fighting is part of the rules of hockey, right?

433
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,449
Speaker 1: But I mean as soon as if they put just one set of players in jail, no one ever fight again.

434
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't know hockey.

435
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:09,320
Speaker 1: I guess like in basketball like fighting seems way less Justifiable if I tell you what if I had played hockey and I thought of this and someone tried to punch me in the face I just press charges and like punch me in the face.

436
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what that might not have worked out.

437
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,484
Speaker 0: So it's the same reason why if you go still I still try and make a big deal.

438
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:17,175
Speaker 0: if you go skiing and hurt yourself You basically can't sue anybody.

439
00:26:17,195 --> 00:26:19,422
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you signed a thing when you bite your lip.

440
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:22,649
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's because you don't sign anything It's at your own risk.

441
00:26:23,272 --> 00:26:37,561
Speaker 0: It's basically that there's a legal precedent around this to a lot of them around the idea that there are certain inherent risks that are common knowledge and common and well-known in certain activities and You cannot pretend to be surprised by them.

442
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:45,684
Speaker 0: Uh-huh fighting is a common part of that sport Especially if you started playing hockey in the old timey days But these aren't the old timey days.

443
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:48,135
Speaker 0: but yeah When would you have done this?

444
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:51,750
Speaker 0: if you're you know in the name 1920 someone tried to see.

445
00:26:52,732 --> 00:26:56,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what era would you try to sue people for punching you in hockey?

446
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,795
Speaker 1: I guess I was I would have if I played hockey.

447
00:26:58,815 --> 00:27:09,547
Speaker 1: I would have been playing hockey in the years 1990 X through 2000 X I'd probably be getting if I was any good if I was bad, I'd be retired already.

448
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,235
Speaker 1: if I was any good I'd be close to it.

449
00:27:11,356 --> 00:27:11,597
Speaker 0: Yep.

450
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:13,830
Speaker 0: You might you might be a team the slow team captain.

451
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:16,469
Speaker 0: Who's not that good on the ice anymore, but still good for the team.

452
00:27:16,972 --> 00:27:19,544
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, we're the same age as Lundquist.

453
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:20,328
Speaker 1: We could have been goldies.

454
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,761
Speaker 0: Yeah I just I still.

455
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:27,971
Speaker 0: whenever I look at that man I feel like he's way older than me because he just looks like such an adult that I do not feel like he is an Adult.

456
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:30,981
Speaker 1: he has mad monies and a better job than we have.

457
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:35,100
Speaker 1: Oh and he only works part of the year and he's Has a wife and kids.

Speaker 0: So great.

462
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:46,201
Speaker 0: I'm tied with Lundquist.

00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:47,546
Speaker 1: He made it.

464
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:48,570

00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,239
Speaker 0: Also, if you just count trophies and medals, you don't qualify them.

Speaker 1: I have that too.

486
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:48,285
Speaker 0: We both have it.

487
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:54,335
Speaker 0: but anyway in the meta moment the booklet book is Still Frank Herbert's.

488
00:28:54,395 --> 00:28:55,861
Speaker 1: do not do names.

489
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:56,423
Speaker 0: We haven't read it.

490
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:57,186
Speaker 0: We should.

491
00:28:57,287 --> 00:28:58,050
Speaker 0: we'll read at some point.

492
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,120
Speaker 1: The spice is gonna flow.

493
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:00,170
Speaker 0: Rebecca was the previous one.

494
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:17,307
Speaker 0: Follow our YouTube channels and if you're so inclined a number of people have been donating their time and their effort to provide closed captions on our more Widely known panel videos because it would be real expensive for me to just pay people to do all that.

495
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:18,493
Speaker 1: Good job everybody Good job.

496
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:22,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, like this is this is great like this Everybody wins if we do this.

497
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,188
Speaker 0: I'm do not do this if you have better things to be doing.

498
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:28,216
Speaker 0: obviously It takes a long-ass time.

499
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:30,224
Speaker 1: it's way easy, but it takes a long-ass time.

500
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:31,550
Speaker 0: like I was I'm working on one.

501
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:36,090
Speaker 1: I did it and I made it through like seven seconds and it took me like a minutes.

502
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:38,363
Speaker 0: Yep, but this is just.

503
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,410
Speaker 1: I feel fast.

504
00:29:39,771 --> 00:29:52,570
Speaker 0: So there's a forum thread and a Google spreadsheet that I made just so that if you are so inclined to donate your time To provide closed captions for those who could not otherwise experience the joy that is geek nights panels.

505
00:29:52,711 --> 00:30:07,449
Speaker 1: Also, I would recommend to you Instead of doing it for our videos go on YouTube find something for like some really important Yeah, find some educational video that's actually valuable that as accepting, you know It's user-submitted subtitles and captions and do that instead.

506
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:15,632
Speaker 0: We've had more than a few people ask us for citation information because they included us in theses All.

507
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:21,803
Speaker 0: any time that happens I just want to be like I kind of want to see the paper to find out Why you're about to lose your doctors?

508
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:27,325
Speaker 1: Yeah Guys on the internet said really we're gonna be.

509
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:28,650
Speaker 0: well, I'm gonna be a Zenkai Khan.

510
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,418
Speaker 0: I I assume Scott's gonna bail on it.

511
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,101
Speaker 1: When is it?

512
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,570

00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:38,225
Speaker 1: I can actually see my calendar properly now.

Speaker 0: I'll hang out there.

545
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:23,159
Speaker 0: Uh There's PAX Unplugged and PAX Prime and PAX Australia Which it is like 90%.

546
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,844
Speaker 0: sure that I'm going to PAX Australia.

547
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:25,004
Speaker 0: 90% pee?

548
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:31,130
Speaker 0: 90% pee That I'm gonna pee in Melbourne during PAX Australia.

549
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:32,313
Speaker 0: I will be there.

550
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,196
Speaker 0: I will pee.

551
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:40,374
Speaker 0: But my panel will not be about peeing or panels, but Geek Night is coming back 90% sure.

552
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:46,689
Speaker 0: Not a hundred percent sure because I haven't actually booked the tickets yet, but it's looking real good For a lot of reasons.

553
00:31:49,111 --> 00:31:55,086
Speaker 0: So, uh When humans started living in domiciles one real big problem is that it's fucking dark inside them.

554
00:31:55,427 --> 00:32:03,650
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm like It is way darker inside places that you live than you realize and you might think it doesn't look that dark.

555
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:04,877
Speaker 0: Get a light meter out.

556
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,226
Speaker 0: It's way darker than you think.

557
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:12,569
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Your brain your eyes are just pretty good at seeing in the dark more than they're not dwarf good or elf good But they're pretty good.

558
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:23,090
Speaker 0: but like the more I do photography and like video and like that kind of stuff the more I Notice like this room is actually like a third as bright as I feel like it should be like it's real dim in here.

559
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:30,075
Speaker 0: It's dark with this one LED light and then like the light for like if I do video like when you see someone filming something And it's ridiculously bright.

560
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:30,878
Speaker 1: You're like, oh my god.

561
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:32,102
Speaker 1: Why is it burn?

562
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:33,967
Speaker 1: It's like because that's how bright it needs to be.

563
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:36,113
Speaker 1: Yep It's dark.

564
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:39,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, but when I make when I stream the podcaster, I'm not doing right now.

565
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:45,861
Speaker 0: the lighting on my face from my monitor is Significant to the overall lighting profile.

566
00:32:46,222 --> 00:32:47,730
Speaker 0: That is how dark it is in this room.

567
00:32:47,991 --> 00:33:00,130
Speaker 1: Anyway, so yeah, it took a long time for us to have any kind of lighting Indoors, right people would make structures with like holes in the roof or no roof or they would just let it be.

568
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,397
Speaker 1: They would barely go inside.

569
00:33:01,497 --> 00:33:07,190
Speaker 1: you go into your cave when you're a caveman and sleep at night And then you just get the hell out as soon as the Sun is up because it was dark at night.

570
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:09,918
Speaker 0: Don't worry we're not going all the way born at this.

571
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:12,750
Speaker 0: we're not gonna do the contrived show of lighting through history.

572
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,310
Speaker 1: No, because we don't know anything about lighting through history.

573
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:27,556
Speaker 0: I know a shocking amount about very specific eras of certain kinds of lighting for unrelated reasons But at one point we invented gas lighting candles Yeah, lamps these sorts of things.

574
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:34,459
Speaker 0: and then you know in the early 20th century my apartment with nothing but glow sticks I just have my Amazon delivery schedule.

575
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:41,142
Speaker 1: We finally got us a light bulb and nowadays Lightbulb technology is actually advanced significantly way fast.

576
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:49,650
Speaker 0: So think of this when we got to RIT it was pretty much incandescent bulbs or Fluorescent like regular old shitty-ass floor.

577
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,570
Speaker 1: There were other kinds of bulbs you could get but for lighting that a normal person would have in their home.

578
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:55,834
Speaker 1: They're home not dark.

579
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:56,897
Speaker 1: You wouldn't really use those.

580
00:33:56,997 --> 00:34:00,407
Speaker 0: what other kind of bulb other than incandescent or fluorescent.

581
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:03,333
Speaker 1: Well this halogen Incandescent is it really?

582
00:34:03,554 --> 00:34:04,276
Speaker 0: that's the scene.

583
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,679
Speaker 0: all incandescent is a very.

584
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,050
Speaker 0: it's a very simple concept of halogen is just different kind of incandescent.

585
00:34:10,712 --> 00:34:12,717
Speaker 0: Mmm, there's still a filament in there.

586
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,866
Speaker 1: So fluorescent that isn't is an incandescent.

587
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:16,288
Speaker 0: Nope.

588
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:17,170
Speaker 0: Fluorescent is different.

589
00:34:17,231 --> 00:34:19,047
Speaker 0: Is it fundamentally different concepts?

590
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:23,862
Speaker 1: I thought fluorescent was the same kind of thing only it was filled with fluorine instead of.

591
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:28,514
Speaker 0: nope, you know, so Basically incandescent bulbs are.

592
00:34:28,556 --> 00:34:32,750
Speaker 0: there's some sort of filament that's burning and you have electricity going through it which heats it up.

593
00:34:33,013 --> 00:34:36,313
Speaker 0: So it gives off photons Usually tungsten.

594
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:39,983
Speaker 0: right tungsten tungsten or there's other things that people use.

595
00:34:40,023 --> 00:34:42,270
Speaker 1: tungsten lasts a hell of a long time is usually why right?

596
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:43,929
Speaker 1: Yeah gives up a ton of light.

597
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:46,022
Speaker 0: I'm digging this article right here to see because there's.

598
00:34:46,063 --> 00:34:47,270
Speaker 0: they use the cold filament.

599
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:49,909
Speaker 0: Okay, this article is way too big.

600
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,516
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can read the Wikipedia.

601
00:34:51,597 --> 00:34:54,168
Speaker 1: you put electrons on the tungsten or whatever and it lights up.

602
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,797
Speaker 0: now There's cool stuff about these.

603
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:59,695
Speaker 0: so I I've always been an advocate for a long time Even though RIT banned them which was annoying.

604
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:08,850
Speaker 0: but I like torsion lamps because they provide the most and demand best diffuse lighting For a mid cell like the kind like a living room sized room, right?

605
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,994
Speaker 1: Cuz what the way they work is.

606
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:14,350
Speaker 1: they shoot light up at the ceiling and your ceiling basically becomes a giant reflector.

607
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:19,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, that reflects light and since it's so much light it reflects the light evenly and softly down.

608
00:35:20,212 --> 00:35:23,009
Speaker 1: So you just get even lighting almost everywhere in the room.

609
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:28,470
Speaker 1: That's you know It's like having a really giant weak light bulb instead of having when you really don't have one.

610
00:35:28,651 --> 00:35:32,895
Speaker 0: So if you had a halogen bulb just pointed like down in your room It would be it would.

611
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:37,890
Speaker 0: it would be horrible burning Sun that you would hate all the time And it would also be really hot like you'd feel its heat.

612
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:44,075
Speaker 1: But imagine if you had the Sun in a bowl and then the Sun shot the ceiling and then the ceiling was actually the light Bulb effective.

613
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:50,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but uh When we were at RIT if you wanted really bright lighting that wasn't like terrible fluorescence.

614
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,556
Speaker 0: You pretty much had to get halogen bulbs Which are super hot and there's.

615
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:59,070
Speaker 0: that's why RIT banned them because they assumed that stupid college kids would literally burn the dorms down.

616
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:03,849
Speaker 1: You can if you get if you go to like a construction site You know at night and you see they have like these giant lights out there.

617
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:09,474
Speaker 1: Or you go to a baseball stadium and like they have these lights that is lighting up the whole fucking thing like daytime Even though it's night.

618
00:36:09,996 --> 00:36:12,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, those things like a bajillion degrees.

619
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:12,769
Speaker 1: Don't touch those.

620
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:22,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, last night Actually, we had the spot on cuz we were playing a game on the floor and Natalie stood up and bumped ever So slightly into the halogen like where the bulb was and burned herself.

621
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:22,485
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

622
00:36:22,787 --> 00:36:23,228
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

623
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:28,862
Speaker 0: Yep so like they have cages around them and That was pretty much as good as you could do.

624
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:35,310
Speaker 0: you buy a nice expensive halogen lamp and you would use that to light like an apartment and I that's what I still use in the living room you can.

625
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:36,915
Speaker 1: Halogen bulbs can also like.

626
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:37,416
Speaker 1: it's weird.

627
00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:50,669
Speaker 0: You can get some that are ridiculously small, but then the brightness is like ah, yep Xenon is probably better, but that's mostly used in like car headlights because it's not as hot But it's way more expensive and just as bright as far as I know.

628
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,083
Speaker 1: Yeah, car headlights also go to the store the auto shop and look for like replacement car bulbs.

629
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:55,765
Speaker 1: They tiny.

630
00:36:56,186 --> 00:37:04,090
Speaker 0: Yep, but When we were at our IT if you want normal light bulbs are incandescent and you kids might not even remember at this point.

631
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:06,825
Speaker 0: But in gas above used between 60 and 100 watts.

632
00:37:08,571 --> 00:37:12,688
Speaker 0: Like they used a lot of power and they were kind of shitty and they cost like 20 cents.

633
00:37:13,573 --> 00:37:15,323
Speaker 1: Yep used to actually you'll get him for free.

634
00:37:15,363 --> 00:37:16,430
Speaker 1: they used to be zero dollars.

635
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:18,961
Speaker 1: Oh, you just get him from the power company for nothing.

636
00:37:19,343 --> 00:37:22,641
Speaker 1: and then eventually they were like, hey It's I would be profiting from this.

637
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:23,909
Speaker 1: so then they started selling them.

638
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:34,650
Speaker 0: But then the compact fluorescence came out and the idea was that they would replace these Ridiculously power inefficient lights with far more efficient light, right?

639
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,990
Speaker 1: So it used to be that fluorescent bulbs were just like the long tubes you would put in the ceiling in like a classroom.

640
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:44,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, or maybe you get the complicated ones that would have like a weird coily tube, but they were still normal fluorescence.

641
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:53,610
Speaker 1: right the compact Fluorescent was a great invention because instead of having the two hookups on the side You could have the it could screw into a normal socket where the incandescent used to go.

642
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, they would have the master whatever building into it.

643
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,371
Speaker 0: but

644
00:37:56,451 --> 00:38:16,069
Speaker 1: since the design still had to be a long tube, they just made one long coily tube that was eventually bulb shaped and Basically you instead of having one long thing you had one sneaky thing in a very small ball shaped area and it's like aha we did it and That meant you could have the fluorescent bulb and a normal socket and it worked and you got the advantages there.

645
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:17,542
Speaker 0: But I guess where what I'm getting to is.

646
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:21,750
Speaker 0: what's really interesting Is that CFLs appeared and at first a lot of people complain about it?

647
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,864
Speaker 0: Most of those people are just dumb because the color is slightly different people.

648
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:26,270
Speaker 1: There's people just hate change, right?

649
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:36,970
Speaker 1: Oh, you know like Twitter made a change today We've talked about this and geek nights many many times people hate change Even if the change is for the better and you know anything that's different is bad and that is a bad attitude.

650
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:38,977
Speaker 1: Anyone has the attitude fuck that.

651
00:38:39,158 --> 00:38:45,985
Speaker 1: but people also complain because they would not to say that all change is good Just to say you should not dislike something just because it is a change.

652
00:38:46,085 --> 00:39:01,910
Speaker 0: they were expensive Like they were expensive, but you had to replace them less often except actually you had to have it replace them a lot Because most people were buying the cheapest bulbs they could get Which burned out like real fast and were real shitty.

653
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:06,070
Speaker 1: They didn't burn out as fast as incandescence, but they still burned out.

654
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:06,679
Speaker 1: I have had.

655
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:16,650
Speaker 1: you know I remember reading like when I bought compact fluorescence originally in the beacon days About how they would last for like years and years and years and they would if you bought the expensive nice one from the good name.

656
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:23,600
Speaker 1: But I have had some at least a few burn out and still most of my bulbs are Compact fluorescence from those days that are still going good.

657
00:39:23,941 --> 00:39:26,109
Speaker 1: Yep, but my new ones are LED ones.

658
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:33,391
Speaker 0: But it's interesting how that technology was very much an interim technology and it's already kind of obsolete Mm-hmm.

659
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:44,030
Speaker 0: because LEDs which back then like I saw like people sold like very special like LED light bulbs You could put in a lamp like a normal lamp and they'd be like 50 bucks.

660
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,922
Speaker 1: Well, I mean we had we've always had LED.

661
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:47,030
Speaker 1: we haven't always had LEDs.

662
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,397
Speaker 1: We've LEDs for a very long time right.

663
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:52,908
Speaker 0: bright white light your remote control and you're affordable, right?

664
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:58,410
Speaker 1: I mean like every electronic device had little red lights that lit up and eventually blue ones or white ones, right?

665
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:07,178
Speaker 1: You know and those are LEDs But no one can make one that was bright enough to like light up a fucking room or using a flashlight until Somewhat recently, you know.

666
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:09,550
Speaker 1: and now you got LED flashlights LED everything.

667
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,409
Speaker 1: Everyone's replacing every light with LEDs because they don't really burn out so much.

668
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,266
Speaker 0: Yep, and now we'll get to the practical stuff and use a lot less energy.

669
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:20,281
Speaker 0: CFLs I'm actually I've replaced almost every CFL I've got with LEDs now.

670
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:21,084
Speaker 1: Well, should I replace?

671
00:40:21,104 --> 00:40:22,328
Speaker 1: the CFL is still working.

672
00:40:22,368 --> 00:40:22,990
Speaker 1: that feels bad.

673
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I. so I haven't done that yet But I'm going to do it.

674
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:28,365
Speaker 0: You know those two box lamps.

675
00:40:28,405 --> 00:40:29,070
Speaker 0: I got in the living room.

676
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:35,819
Speaker 0: They have CFLs that I bought when we moved into this apartment and they're not that bright and part of that's because you know those those lights.

677
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,649
Speaker 0: I'd like them to be brighter not sun bright, but brighter.

678
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:47,610
Speaker 0: an LED that would go into one of those because they basically don't generate any Significant heat could be about twice as bright and use less power than the CFLs.

679
00:40:48,757 --> 00:40:51,050
Speaker 0: But then I'll have to have these two perfectly good CFLs.

680
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:56,750
Speaker 0: I would basically have to Keep in my apartment until the next amnesty day probably and then take them over to the special recycle, right?

681
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,412
Speaker 1: That's the main thing.

682
00:40:57,452 --> 00:41:09,183
Speaker 1: CFLs for all their good benefits of energy usage and long-lasting this they have a very small amount of mercury in Each one and so if they break They're very dangerous and you have to sweep them up properly.

683
00:41:09,203 --> 00:41:15,290
Speaker 1: and even if you want to throw them out You have to dispose of them properly by taking them to like Best Buy or to your local recycling.

684
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:21,835
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say if you can't just throw them in the trash like an incandescent which is you know, but even throwing away incandescent It's still pointy glass.

685
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:23,239
Speaker 1: So you throw it away carefully.

686
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,710
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you throw CFLs away in your garbage, you're a bad person.

687
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,821
Speaker 0: Yeah I really deeply disrespect you.

688
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:29,525
Speaker 0: you're very bad.

689
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:37,521
Speaker 0: do that and The reason I disrespect you is because I had a fucking box of CFLs that every few months I take to a place and deal with.

690
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:40,963
Speaker 0: it's a giant pain in the ass Because I don't want to break them while I'm transporting them.

691
00:41:40,983 --> 00:41:45,468
Speaker 0: Yeah, and cuz I don't have a car I transport them usually by biking with them in a backpack.

692
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:51,278
Speaker 0: Yep so, uh Lighting your apartment's dark.

693
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:52,184
Speaker 0: So what are you gonna do about it?

694
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:53,250
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get more lights.

695
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:53,889
Speaker 1: That's what I'm gonna do.

696
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,339
Speaker 0: What kind of like is you used to always complain about torsiers?

697
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:04,030
Speaker 0: whenever I talked about a torsier style lamb and this happen on geek Nights many times you would bitch about them and complain about them and tell me I was dumb for liking them.

698
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,379
Speaker 1: I don't really like the style.

699
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:06,165
Speaker 1: It's not a good style.

700
00:42:06,225 --> 00:42:06,970
Speaker 0: So what's a good style?

701
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:10,285
Speaker 0: What do you what is the style you would use to light say this rumor.

702
00:42:10,346 --> 00:42:12,756
Speaker 1: and now well I mean depends how much money I got.

703
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:12,917
Speaker 1: right.

704
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:20,161
Speaker 1: if I had mad moneys, I would just buy only Tiffany lamps Right, you know with the colored glass and shit, right?

705
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:22,007
Speaker 1: See if I had I can't afford.

706
00:42:22,047 --> 00:42:23,090
Speaker 1: I can't even afford one Tiffany.

707
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:31,330
Speaker 0: I would do the thing we were talking about before the show where I would get the LD light bar of LEDs like around the ceiling like the diffuse LED bar.

708
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:32,940
Speaker 1: Well, I mean that's the thing is like.

709
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:40,968
Speaker 1: because I'm renting this tiny apartment I feel like there's a lot of things that I would do if I say owned a house that I wouldn't do even if they're Simply because I'm renting.

710
00:42:40,988 --> 00:42:41,511
Speaker 1: I don't make like a.

711
00:42:41,571 --> 00:42:44,265
Speaker 0: that's something that's always That it was like.

712
00:42:44,305 --> 00:42:50,871
Speaker 1: I really like you and lights are built into the ceiling and you switch which is how it is in my Kitchen, but I can't add those over to the living room area.

713
00:42:51,092 --> 00:42:51,554
Speaker 1: good.

714
00:42:51,634 --> 00:42:52,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, it's not.

715
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:53,866
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

716
00:42:53,887 --> 00:43:05,540
Speaker 0: when I was a kid in Michigan every house I lived in every house my friends lived in every room had ceiling lighting of some kind built in Mm-hmm, and then when I moved to New York, I basically stopped encountering that New York.

717
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:10,808
Speaker 1: Because New York houses are older right and no one's modifying their house And they already have lamps.

718
00:43:10,828 --> 00:43:12,778
Speaker 1: because they live in New York's they buy lamps so that you know.

719
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:17,220
Speaker 1: So only new places have that old grandparents house had it only in certain rooms.

720
00:43:17,321 --> 00:43:25,980
Speaker 0: But because there was a giant party house They built like giant house with like a bar in it and like living room family room like an entertaining room everywhere.

721
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:35,758
Speaker 0: But they the living room was giant and they had like this area where there's the TV and then like an L big l-shaped couch And they'd have lamps lighting that area up.

722
00:43:36,423 --> 00:43:42,099
Speaker 0: But when we were visiting unless there were a bunch of people around They would not turn on lights anywhere else in the house.

723
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:51,872
Speaker 0: So you'd be in this like lit area bounded by the couches and it would be dark dark Like you could barely see the wall bowed before the saving electricity.

724
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:53,136
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, of course they were.

725
00:43:53,176 --> 00:43:54,300
Speaker 0: this is when I was a kid.

726
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but it was weird as a kid to go to grandma's house at night because the house was so dark.

727
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,785
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a habit.

728
00:44:00,885 --> 00:44:09,082
Speaker 1: I mean, it's you know, I if I have it when we had more than one room It's like when you're going to other parts of the house You're not using some parts of the house turn off the lights in the part You're not using.

729
00:44:09,123 --> 00:44:12,457
Speaker 0: well when you have one big room and you turn off the lights in like half the room.

730
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:13,060
Speaker 1: That's weird.

731
00:44:13,882 --> 00:44:14,385
Speaker 1: It was a big room.

732
00:44:14,405 --> 00:44:16,156
Speaker 1: Whatever room I'm in all the lights should be on.

733
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:19,399
Speaker 1: Yeah But uh, unless it's watching a movie or so.

734
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:27,040
Speaker 0: So the only overhead lights I got is there's a bunch of halogen spots in our kitchen Which are really nice and then we have separate fluorescent lighting for the fill.

735
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:31,500
Speaker 0: I have spot and fill in all the parts of my apartment that have built-in lighting.

736
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:34,711
Speaker 0: like even the bathroom has a fill light like a fluorescent on the top.

737
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:38,591
Speaker 0: and then I have the like the lights on the Mirror that are xenon for some.

738
00:44:38,611 --> 00:44:39,660
Speaker 0: well, they're not xenon anymore.

739
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:48,827
Speaker 1: I just replaced them with LEDs, but they're xenon and that provides like my bathroom has like these four giant bulbs that are circles You know, they're like they're like orbs.

740
00:44:49,048 --> 00:44:50,495
Speaker 0: I hate that style of light bulb.

741
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:55,536
Speaker 1: They're above the Above the mirror and that's what the house that's the apartment came with.

742
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:56,240
Speaker 1: that was there.

743
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:03,427
Speaker 0: So the halogens the spots kept burning out Like every few months one would go.

744
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:17,880
Speaker 0: so I replaced one of them with a CFL that was in the form factor of a halogen spot and It wasn't as bright and eventually after about a year It started not turning on all the way and it would like turn out all the way later if you left it on.

745
00:45:18,903 --> 00:45:24,340
Speaker 0: I eventually I bought like $20 like fancy LED spotlights and replaced every one of them.

746
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:25,785
Speaker 0: They've been perfect ever since.

747
00:45:25,825 --> 00:45:30,380
Speaker 0: they're way brighter than the halogens and they generate like zero heat which is just fascinating to me.

748
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:35,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, the heat is actually a big deal right because incandescents like you'd want to change the bulb and it'd be all hot and shit.

749
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,953
Speaker 1: Yeah LEDs is like no problem.

750
00:45:36,973 --> 00:45:37,779
Speaker 1: You can just touch them all day.

751
00:45:38,032 --> 00:45:43,556
Speaker 0: Yeah But also means that I have light fixtures that have a wattage limit like no more than 150 watts in this thing.

752
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:45,959
Speaker 0: You know, you don't start a fire.

753
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:54,420
Speaker 0: But if you put an LED in that old fixture You can ignore that and you could get a hundred and fifty watt quote unquote equivalent.

754
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:59,480
Speaker 0: Or just get whatever light bulb you want and like as bright as you want because it's not gonna use that many watts.

755
00:45:59,621 --> 00:45:59,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's.

756
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:01,696
Speaker 1: it's not gonna use even close to that many watts.

757
00:46:01,918 --> 00:46:09,329
Speaker 1: Yep So if you actually had an LED that used a hundred and fifty watts of actual electricity from the wall You're just like be dangerous.

758
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,859
Speaker 1: It was like burn your face like.

759
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:10,919
Speaker 1: ah.

760
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:16,280
Speaker 0: So some lamps too because my apartment's also not bright.

761
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,420
Speaker 1: The problem is that eat, you know, even basic lamps cost a lot of money and not Tiffany lamp, right?

762
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,741
Speaker 1: Just lamps from that are mass manufactured or not cheap if you want ones that aren't garbage Yep.

763
00:46:26,022 --> 00:46:30,299
Speaker 1: Now Joe and I see even IKEA like a lamp could be like 50 60 bucks or something.

764
00:46:30,419 --> 00:46:32,788
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, it's a 50 60 every time.

765
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:35,679
Speaker 1: that's really kind of low-end lamp - every time I've got.

766
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:38,032
Speaker 0: yeah Here's the IKEA lamp 20 bucks stand upright.

767
00:46:38,052 --> 00:46:41,751
Speaker 0: Oh Takes a standard socket up top so you can put a CFL in there.

768
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:43,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a really cheap.

769
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:45,440
Speaker 0: Oh, this is the lamp we have in the bedroom.

770
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,463
Speaker 1: That's a cheapo lamp.

771
00:46:47,046 --> 00:46:49,474
Speaker 0: It is a cheapo lamp, but it probably works.

772
00:46:49,514 --> 00:46:50,999
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be that bright super cheapo.

773
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:57,360
Speaker 0: But when I've gone to like a store and looked at lamps, I've seen really nice lamps to do exactly what I want.

774
00:46:57,822 --> 00:46:59,869
Speaker 0: They're like three hundred dollars.

775
00:46:59,929 --> 00:47:00,130
Speaker 0: Yep.

776
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:00,993
Speaker 1: Let's see.

777
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:01,956
Speaker 1: IKEA has 97 floor lamps.

778
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:04,553
Speaker 1: That one's 50 bucks.

779
00:47:06,964 --> 00:47:11,849
Speaker 0: Okay, so the last 90 by the last time For lamps.

780
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:18,340
Speaker 0: well two times ago I ended up buying like I did a lot of research and the most of the lamps for sale on Amazon.

781
00:47:18,862 --> 00:47:23,158
Speaker 0: We're really garbage and we're from manufacturers who looked like they made nothing but garbage.

782
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,444
Speaker 0: Yep And those are all still here.

783
00:47:25,545 --> 00:47:29,720
Speaker 0: but increasingly there's this company bright tech that I noticed and I still think they're making cheap stuff.

784
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:38,220
Speaker 0: but it looks like they Make fixtures that just take LEDs that are just built into them and they've gone kind of crazy with the form factors.

785
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:43,100
Speaker 0: And I feel like when I get a new lamp, I'm gonna get one of these like weird form factors.

786
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,607
Speaker 1: It's a really weird kind of lamp.

787
00:47:45,768 --> 00:47:46,492
Speaker 0: Well look like this one.

788
00:47:46,552 --> 00:47:48,260
Speaker 0: It's just a disc on the top of a stick.

789
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, that looks really stupid.

790
00:47:49,587 --> 00:47:50,974
Speaker 1: That's like you look any different than this.

791
00:47:51,114 --> 00:47:52,200
Speaker 1: that also looks really stupid.

792
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,023
Speaker 0: Why does it look stupid?

793
00:47:53,144 --> 00:47:53,787
Speaker 1: It looks stupid.

794
00:47:53,987 --> 00:47:56,297
Speaker 0: Why how would you design a torchier lamp?

795
00:47:56,317 --> 00:47:57,060
Speaker 0: That doesn't look stupid.

796
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:59,200
Speaker 1: I wouldn't use a torchier lamp because it looks stupid.

797
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,597
Speaker 1: I've put a lamp for the shade like a normal lamp like a normal person.

798
00:48:02,657 --> 00:48:06,280
Speaker 0: what like just Sticking up way high in your ceiling just like a lamp shade?

799
00:48:06,942 --> 00:48:11,037
Speaker 0: No, just you know, like what we'll find an image of what you think you want.

800
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:11,920
Speaker 0: cuz I don't think it exists.

801
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,342
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

802
00:48:12,382 --> 00:48:12,744
Speaker 1: I have it.

803
00:48:13,006 --> 00:48:14,353
Speaker 1: what here it is.

804
00:48:14,615 --> 00:48:15,499
Speaker 1: It's a normal ass lamp.

805
00:48:16,183 --> 00:48:20,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, see it's a stick and at the top of the stick is a bulb with a shader.

806
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,255
Speaker 0: That's that's not gonna provide enough diffuse light because that lampshade is gonna prevent our diffusion.

807
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,780
Speaker 0: That's why your apartments dark.

808
00:48:27,524 --> 00:48:28,912
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I have a normal looking lamp.

809
00:48:28,952 --> 00:48:30,220
Speaker 1: That's it's not supposed to be crazy.

810
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,165
Speaker 1: How bright do you want it?

811
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:33,820
Speaker 0: plus honestly until relatively recently?

812
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,737
Speaker 0: I had never in my life seen a tall lamp that had a traditional lamp shade on it.

813
00:48:37,837 --> 00:48:39,183
Speaker 0: all lamps are there Torchy air?

814
00:48:39,706 --> 00:48:42,399
Speaker 0: or if it had a lamp shade it was a lamp that was on a table.

815
00:48:43,242 --> 00:48:44,649
Speaker 0: That lamp does not look great.

816
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:45,834
Speaker 0: I don't think okay.

817
00:48:45,854 --> 00:48:47,060
Speaker 0: That's not a good style of lamp.

818
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,130
Speaker 1: It's a perfectly normal land.

819
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:50,560
Speaker 0: I think torch air provides.

820
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:51,329
Speaker 0: See that's your problem.

821
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:57,800
Speaker 0: the kind of lamp you Aesthetically seem to want is not in any way going to provide enough light for you to not say your apartment is too dark.

822
00:48:58,285 --> 00:48:59,135
Speaker 1: Just get more of them.

823
00:49:00,283 --> 00:49:01,332
Speaker 0: How many I think you would need?

824
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:02,179
Speaker 0: like six of those.

825
00:49:03,304 --> 00:49:05,351
Speaker 0: I think you would need six of those.

826
00:49:05,391 --> 00:49:10,311
Speaker 0: your apartment is pretty dark like darker than my living room Mm-hmm and my living rooms just got that big torch air.

827
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:12,400
Speaker 0: and then the two really dim box lights.

828
00:49:13,023 --> 00:49:16,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, box lights are a weird thing right cuz I like to shooting light sideways and down ways.

829
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,603
Speaker 1: It's like you know.

830
00:49:17,683 --> 00:49:18,487
Speaker 0: yeah, I got these.

831
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:21,800
Speaker 1: I bought the box lights partly because yours only have the box at the top.

832
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:23,471
Speaker 1: I seen ones that are box all the way down.

833
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:24,740
Speaker 1: I'm like how many bulbs are in there?

834
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,463
Speaker 0: I don't like those.

835
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:34,260
Speaker 0: is it bulbs all the way to hate way more than the what the box lamps that have multiple boxes are Those Boston style ones that just have a bunch of like shitty spotlights hanging off at weird angles.

836
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:38,010
Speaker 1: Oh the one that looks like a tree like yeah like that.

837
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:40,156
Speaker 0: Those are the wars those are the ugliest.

838
00:49:40,236 --> 00:49:51,620
Speaker 1: so those kind of lamps It's like I can actually understand one of those in one situation All right You got a big-ass living room in the suburbs all right And you got a reclining type chair or the at the side of a couch where you're gonna sit.

839
00:49:52,182 --> 00:49:54,189
Speaker 0: Ah you put it like between and you put that.

840
00:49:54,209 --> 00:50:01,400
Speaker 1: you put the lamp right behind the couch or next to the chair So that one of those sneaky arms can be like a reading lamp so you can see your TV.

841
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,282
Speaker 0: Oh, no You're thinking of like.

842
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:07,399
Speaker 0: you're thinking of this nonsense that has the lamp and then like the thing hanging off exactly one of them.

843
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:12,079
Speaker 1: one Of them is aimed at you for the TV guide reading and one of them is aimed at the whole room.

844
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:19,169
Speaker 1: But be it you put it next to you because that way you can control both of those lights while you're sitting there watching TV Like a lazy ass.

845
00:50:19,675 --> 00:50:20,160
Speaker 0: I agree with you.

846
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,003
Speaker 0: That's the only other.

847
00:50:21,204 --> 00:50:25,480
Speaker 1: that and the one the one that has three arms is just a variation of that where?

848
00:50:25,882 --> 00:50:28,132
Speaker 1: You know one of the arms sort of shoots somewhere.

849
00:50:28,253 --> 00:50:29,740
Speaker 1: one of them shoots up and one of them is down.

850
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:34,720
Speaker 0: You say that but every time I've gone to someone's apartment, and they have that tree like Boston style lamb.

851
00:50:34,982 --> 00:50:36,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, that kind it.

852
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:39,567
Speaker 1: one of them is aimed at you Anything in particular.

853
00:50:39,608 --> 00:50:41,680
Speaker 0: they're just using it to try to fill light the whole room.

854
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,692
Speaker 0: But because it's they're kind of low and no light is going upward.

855
00:50:45,034 --> 00:50:46,460
Speaker 0: They actually make the room way darker.

856
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:48,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, those they're not effective at lighting a whole room.

857
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:50,440
Speaker 1: They're effective at lighting like you know.

858
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:52,810
Speaker 1: You like certain areas right.

859
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:53,172
Speaker 1: so you could.

860
00:50:53,192 --> 00:50:58,037
Speaker 0: you got to aim the three of those Suburban house and you want accent lighting on some thing that I guess you could use some.

861
00:50:58,077 --> 00:50:58,177
Speaker 0: right.

862
00:50:58,197 --> 00:50:58,720
Speaker 1: you got to put it.

863
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,729
Speaker 1: It's like one of those shoots down at you.

864
00:51:01,051 --> 00:51:10,174
Speaker 1: one of them shoots like over near the TV Okay, so you get up or like shoots like at the coffee table Yeah, and one of them maybe shoots like to the back wall or something you know.

865
00:51:10,896 --> 00:51:21,479
Speaker 0: so I really like Modern torsiers because now that they're using LEDs like the one I got here They don't need to have the giant cage over the top So you don't accidentally start a fire if you knock it over.

866
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:27,080
Speaker 0: They don't need to have the glass shield to prevent UV radiation from giving you a sunburn in your own house.

867
00:51:28,061 --> 00:51:32,053
Speaker 0: And they're actually way way brighter like this one here and are in the studio.

868
00:51:32,434 --> 00:51:35,924
Speaker 0: There's only three tiny LEDs in that whole thing Mm-hmm.

869
00:51:35,944 --> 00:51:38,099
Speaker 0: they sell one that has like a whole ring of LED.

870
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,891
Speaker 1: I mean, I have a flashlight with an LED, and he says like it.

871
00:51:41,192 --> 00:51:42,818
Speaker 1: You know freaking blind people that thing.

872
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:43,605
Speaker 1: yeah I am.

873
00:51:44,130 --> 00:52:08,440
Speaker 0: yeah fine my druthers I would definitely put ceiling or at least like if you have a high ceiling maybe on the sides like I'd ring the room with LED driven light bars Because I don't like track lighting like track lighting just feels really 80s like late 80s early 90s yuppie house in the affluent suburbs And it doesn't feel like it's practical because it makes too many spots and too many like too many hot spots and too many cold spots.

874
00:52:08,701 --> 00:52:15,185
Speaker 0: Like you've got all these individual little lights pointed in different places up there Mm-hmm.

875
00:52:15,787 --> 00:52:17,113
Speaker 0: so what are you gonna do?

876
00:52:17,314 --> 00:52:18,257
Speaker 0: What are you gonna buy?

877
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:18,860
Speaker 1: I don't know.

878
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:19,958
Speaker 1: I'm gonna probably just get two.

879
00:52:20,161 --> 00:52:25,155
Speaker 1: I think I just get two identical lamps that are good because right now I have one lamp to the left of the TV right.

880
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:35,700
Speaker 1: yep I'm gonna move that lamp back into this space near my desk where I have some room if I get rid of some stuff And then I'll buy two identical lamps and put one on each side of the TV.

881
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:44,458
Speaker 1: Here's the problem though that is that the light switch for turning on lights only controls this one outlet Even though there's outlets on both sides of the TV.

882
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:51,580
Speaker 0: I have extension cords plugged into various ways to extend that to control multiple labs from all my but it's like it's so annoying though.

883
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:52,507
Speaker 1: Right it's like should.

884
00:52:52,527 --> 00:52:54,260
Speaker 1: maybe I can get some sort of like home.

885
00:52:54,601 --> 00:52:57,212
Speaker 1: You know like I don't really want to use all this stupid home automation system.

886
00:52:57,232 --> 00:52:57,794
Speaker 1: things cuz my.

887
00:52:57,815 --> 00:52:59,080
Speaker 1: I have one room two rooms.

888
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:08,820
Speaker 1: Yep, it's not necessary, but maybe I can just get like one component from that kind of system to use To turn on all the lights and turn off all the lights without having a bunch of wires everywhere.

889
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:12,858
Speaker 1: I've thought about that because just use it just use it for on/off switch and nothing else.

890
00:53:12,959 --> 00:53:15,409
Speaker 0: yeah I just don't trust any of those systems.

891
00:53:15,469 --> 00:53:17,460
Speaker 0: is the main reason why I have not gone down that road?

892
00:53:17,601 --> 00:53:22,929
Speaker 1: No, I mean you know I mean I guess if I own the house I would also get the thermostat one, but that's about it.

893
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:25,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've heard a lot of people have the thermostat one.

894
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,937
Speaker 1: It's not great though, so no I'd probably get like you know the extra nerdy one, but I just made.

895
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,979
Speaker 0: do Arduino yourself maybe but uh.

896
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:51,900
Speaker 0: So I'm thinking about getting for it because I need a one more lamp in the living room I think because if we play games on the table I don't have a light that's directly shining at the table Which would not be a concern except German board games like you really need a real light pointed directly at the game.

897
00:53:52,663 --> 00:54:02,540
Speaker 0: it is actually kind of hard to deal with board games and even like a Generally well lit normal like kitchen or bathroom or bathroom or a living room that most people have in their houses.

898
00:54:03,423 --> 00:54:08,340
Speaker 1: Another kind of light that I don't see are the ever these days is the chandelier.

899
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,460
Speaker 0: Ah My grandparents house had huge ornate chandeliers in both dining rooms, right?

900
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,844
Speaker 1: So that's the only place you really see.

901
00:54:15,884 --> 00:54:18,533
Speaker 1: them is like above a dining table, right?

902
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:20,338
Speaker 1: It's like that's the only place.

903
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:23,469
Speaker 1: yep But I like me a chandelier.

904
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:26,560
Speaker 1: I don't know when you go to the theater and have like this fucking enormous ones.

905
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:32,760
Speaker 0: It's like oh shit, son I guess I've always felt that the ones I encounter in houses feel really cheap because they are really cheap usually.

906
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:34,715
Speaker 1: But you know some people have not cheap ones.

907
00:54:34,857 --> 00:54:39,491
Speaker 1: the thing is You know a chandelier is is pretty cool because not only like.

908
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:40,233
Speaker 1: is it a thing?

909
00:54:40,253 --> 00:54:42,804
Speaker 1: and it like means you don't have some boring Ceiling.

910
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:44,119
Speaker 1: you actually have something going on up there.

911
00:54:44,741 --> 00:54:52,620
Speaker 0: They're really effective at lighting up the whole fucking room usually not nearly as effective as a light bar or a modern way of doing that.

912
00:54:53,023 --> 00:55:01,409
Speaker 1: But you go in a place that has a chandelier Right like a big one and you turn it on and turn it off and you be like, oh, yep So here's here's what I know about chandeliers.

913
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:11,011
Speaker 0: based on the fact that there were a bunch of my grandparents house and my mom Explaining to me in great detail why we did not have any in our house one You're gonna hit it and knock it and break it all the time.

914
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:13,100
Speaker 1: Well, that's why they're usually above tables.

915
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:15,303
Speaker 0: Ever move your table.

916
00:55:15,323 --> 00:55:15,845
Speaker 0: You're fucked.

917
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't move your table three.

918
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:21,640
Speaker 0: You gotta dust that shit like every couple days.

919
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,549
Speaker 1: Yep, that's all depends the design of it.

920
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,580
Speaker 0: But yes, there's almost no design.

921
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:29,075
Speaker 1: I can imagine you want to talk about dusting right the cousin of the chandelier.

922
00:55:29,115 --> 00:55:31,687
Speaker 1: and this is the thing is a lot of people Replace their chandeliers.

923
00:55:31,988 --> 00:55:34,319
Speaker 1: They had ceiling fixtures where a chandelier would go.

924
00:55:34,504 --> 00:55:43,500
Speaker 1: Yeah But in the 80s and 90s Maybe in the 70s They replaced them with spinning fans with lights under them covered on the top with dust that they forget about until the summer.

925
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:44,784
Speaker 1: That's right every year.

926
00:55:44,965 --> 00:55:45,326
Speaker 1: That's what.

927
00:55:45,366 --> 00:55:49,420
Speaker 1: that's why there's a lot less chandeliers because those places in old houses got replaced with fans.

928
00:55:50,164 --> 00:55:52,560
Speaker 0: They said everyone they always put their fans in wrong.

929
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:55,740
Speaker 1: So the fans wobble some of them but some of them get them installed, right?

930
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:05,862
Speaker 1: But the point is those fans actually the lights on the bottom of the fan usually have like four bulbs aiming different directions And if the room is small that usually lights up the whole Michigan.

931
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:09,340
Speaker 0: every room of every house had a fan and had those lights.

932
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,555
Speaker 1: Oh, we only had one in the kitchen most.

933
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,720
Speaker 0: Wow the kitchens the one room.

934
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,715
Speaker 0: We actually did not have that because the kid the kitchen had a chandelier.

935
00:56:16,735 --> 00:56:17,700
Speaker 1: in the dining room had a shed.

936
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,255
Speaker 0: Oh, see we had a separate dining room.

937
00:56:19,517 --> 00:56:19,800
Speaker 0: We did.

938
00:56:21,706 --> 00:56:26,100
Speaker 1: We had a table under each one But the chandelier in the kitchen was quickly replaced with the fan.

939
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:28,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had fans ceiling fan.

940
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:31,200
Speaker 0: lots of those houses had fans and light combo.

941
00:56:31,381 --> 00:56:37,808
Speaker 1: I don't know when the fan light combo was invented, but it feels like it was invented, you know Not in the 60s maybe earlier.

942
00:56:37,848 --> 00:56:40,740
Speaker 1: that I think actually I haven't seen any ridiculously old.

943
00:56:40,881 --> 00:56:45,460
Speaker 0: I suspect why there isn't a lot of overhead lighting in these like luxury New York apartments.

944
00:56:46,043 --> 00:56:48,658
Speaker 0: Is that the one of the I guess?

945
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:53,620
Speaker 0: Displays of affluence or and things like that in modern New York style apartments?

946
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:55,606
Speaker 0: Is that you gotta have the high ceiling?

947
00:56:55,666 --> 00:57:00,279
Speaker 0: like the higher the ceiling is the more like fancy the building is to a point?

948
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:14,110
Speaker 0: Which is your thing for old housing like a standard height ceiling like if you're used to the hot tall ceilings Feels kind of like a dank cave When the ceilings right there, so like the our ceilings are way higher than is in any way like reasonable or necessary

949
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:16,976
Speaker 1: Ceilings feels about normal.

950
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:17,578
Speaker 0: This is what 14.

951
00:57:17,578 --> 00:57:21,110
Speaker 0: This is that this is considered like high-end luxury ceiling height.

952
00:57:22,411 --> 00:57:23,836
Speaker 0: Most apartments will not be this high.

953
00:57:24,036 --> 00:57:25,561
Speaker 1: This is about a high - right?

954
00:57:25,581 --> 00:57:26,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're you're a similar.

955
00:57:27,025 --> 00:57:30,555
Speaker 0: like luxury class apartment Apartments are a foot.

956
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:30,696
Speaker 0: see.

957
00:57:30,716 --> 00:57:35,784
Speaker 1: when I think of high ceiling I think of like whoa Has two stories like.

958
00:57:36,027 --> 00:57:39,142
Speaker 1: no Well, that is high but I'm talking high like you.

959
00:57:39,183 --> 00:57:40,810
Speaker 1: let a balloon go and now you can't get it back.

960
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:45,430
Speaker 0: So as a kid we had that because for a while we lived in a ranch house that had the art the steeple ceiling.

961
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

962
00:57:46,815 --> 00:57:50,390
Speaker 0: So live there was at least every month or two.

963
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:59,047
Speaker 0: There was a helium balloon stuck up there for a while Mm-hmm, and there was a fan up there and no one ever wanted to dust it because it's a pain in the ass.

964
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:01,915
Speaker 0: There was a time forget.

965
00:58:01,935 --> 00:58:05,230
Speaker 0: there's a word there's a like house building word for that, but I forget.

966
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:09,530
Speaker 0: Anyway, where was I going with my onion belt story?

967
00:58:10,632 --> 00:58:11,254
Speaker 1: Is the style?

968
00:58:11,294 --> 00:58:12,620
Speaker 0: time was the style at the time.

969
00:58:12,981 --> 00:58:14,528
Speaker 0: I completely lost my train of thought there.

970
00:58:14,568 --> 00:58:15,030
Speaker 0: so it's gone.

971
00:58:15,332 --> 00:58:17,609
Speaker 0: All right to make the ceilings higher.

972
00:58:18,232 --> 00:58:22,490
Speaker 0: Notice how it's just the slab with some spackle paint a lot of the ceilings.

973
00:58:22,651 --> 00:58:24,227
Speaker 1: There was no drop thing under it with.

974
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:28,550
Speaker 0: yeah And to get the ceiling a foot or at least a half a foot higher.

975
00:58:29,113 --> 00:58:32,350
Speaker 0: There's no drop ceiling in most apartments anymore, at least fancy apartments.

976
00:58:32,732 --> 00:58:36,650
Speaker 0: So the only drop ceiling I have in my apartment is in the area directly over the kitchen.

977
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:38,402
Speaker 0: So I have all the spotlights in there.

978
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:39,550
Speaker 0: that's the only end the hallway.

979
00:58:40,232 --> 00:58:41,615
Speaker 1: That is the same as my apartment.

980
00:58:41,716 --> 00:58:46,047
Speaker 1: the ceiling above the kitchen is slightly lower because this room is basically there.

981
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:50,810
Speaker 1: put lights in there Yeah, and then the ceiling Everywhere else is slightly higher than that.

982
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:56,810
Speaker 0: So there's literally no way you could mount a light or anything there because there's not much space between that slab and the next apartment.

983
00:58:57,031 --> 00:59:00,640
Speaker 0: Yep, I guess there's the soundproofing or whatever because I don't hear anything.

984
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,903
Speaker 1: I heard almost nothing.

985
00:59:02,144 --> 00:59:04,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never hear anyone which is good.

986
00:59:05,696 --> 00:59:07,109
Speaker 1: If I open the window I hear a lot from outside.

987
00:59:07,692 --> 00:59:12,990
Speaker 0: So I'm looking at some of these fancy form factors, and I'm really thinking about getting this weird curved lamp.

988
00:59:13,771 --> 00:59:20,134
Speaker 1: How does that light that only see that feels like a lamp that shoots down and is good for like putting next to your chair Like in that picture?

989
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:23,530
Speaker 1: so like yeah, you can read, but it doesn't look like it's good for lighting a whole room.

990
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:26,389
Speaker 0: So there's another one where the LEDs are on the back of it.

991
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, it only has light in the whole room.

992
00:59:29,558 --> 00:59:32,330
Speaker 0: I think it might because these are way better off with the flying saucer thing.

993
00:59:32,915 --> 00:59:34,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh, there's the crazy flying saucer thing.

994
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:37,903
Speaker 0: It's like a ring LED and then another ring LED.

995
00:59:37,923 --> 00:59:39,550
Speaker 0: so it forms almost like a sphere of light.

996
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:44,582
Speaker 0: So lights going up and down and left and right and you put it in the corner of the room And it lights the whole room.

997
00:59:44,663 --> 00:59:46,091
Speaker 0: crazy Mm-hmm.

998
00:59:46,432 --> 00:59:55,390
Speaker 0: the problem is there's no way for me to tell how well any of these weird form factors actually work in a real apartment Because there's this not like this company like this is Amazon.

999
00:59:55,451 --> 00:59:57,428
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure Amazon is the only place you can buy this stuff.

1000
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:01,690
Speaker 0: Like if I go to the lighting store in New York, it doesn't have this shit.

1001
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,650
Speaker 0: It has the $400 completely different lamps that I'm not gonna buy.

1002
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,514
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Did we kill enough time?

1003
01:00:08,615 --> 01:00:09,238
Speaker 0: is the show done?

1004
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,041
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1005
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:12,070
Speaker 0: got anything else to say about indoor lighting?

1006
01:00:13,091 --> 01:00:14,805
Speaker 0: No, cuz we didn't get home to our lighting.

1007
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:21,860
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say this I hope there's someone out there listening and it's almost definitely someone out there listening knows a lot more about indoor lighting than we do And corrects the hell out of us.

1008
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,050
Speaker 1: and yeah gives us some advice.

1009
01:00:23,592 --> 01:00:24,958
Speaker 1: That's usually how these shows go.

1010
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:27,490
Speaker 0: is your house or apartment adequately bright?

1011
01:00:28,673 --> 01:00:31,250
Speaker 1: Is it actually adequately possible to be too bright?

1012
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:33,056
Speaker 1: What is the brightness that it should be there?

1013
01:00:33,136 --> 01:00:36,710
Speaker 0: is possibly too possible to be too bright for me too bright is you know?

1014
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:46,399
Speaker 0: Sometimes you go to a store Especially some Duane Reade's down and they have like the makeup section and it's like way Bright in that retail area.

1015
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:49,090
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's because you really need to see colors properly.

1016
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:57,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's also like I get uncomfortable and my eyes start to hurt if I'm in that kind of room for more than like a half-hour Like that level of bread.

1017
01:00:57,498 --> 01:00:59,210
Speaker 0: There's some lobbies in New York that are like that.

1018
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:02,089
Speaker 0: They're like ultra ultra crazy bright in your face.

1019
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:09,010
Speaker 0: That is too bright because it's like perfectly diffuse light coming from a whole bunch of light bars all over the place.

1020
01:01:09,312 --> 01:01:10,220
Speaker 0: Strategically placed.

1021
01:01:10,563 --> 01:01:16,744
Speaker 0: that is too much But I would like this room to be about twice as bright as it is now 90% more light.
