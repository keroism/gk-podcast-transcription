1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,929
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, April 23rd.

2
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:12,692
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:13,294
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:14,940
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,560
Speaker 0: Tonight we, I guess theoretically, primarily talk about Maurice the Jojo.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, we totally blew off last night's show.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,080
Speaker 0: Well, you know how, you know, the stuff that, you know, at work, there are some things, you know, you're just working on them.

9
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:43,500
Speaker 0: And there are some other things where it's like, okay, you're just working on them, but there's a deadline.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,322
Speaker 0: And there's some other things.

11
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:45,847
Speaker 0: you could work on it or not.

12
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:50,440
Speaker 0: And then occasionally something will happen and you have to work on it right now.

13
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,132
Speaker 0: Those things never happen unless you're about to leave.

14
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,460
Speaker 0: They never happen as soon as you walk in in the morning.

15
00:00:57,101 --> 00:01:03,039
Speaker 1: For three days in a row, I'll say this, I've barely escaped, but every day I leave work pretty much at four to catch the 4.10 train.

16
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,282
Speaker 1: It's so perfect.

17
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:09,801
Speaker 1: But every day for the last three days, I'll be sitting there and it's like, all right, it's 3.58.

18
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:14,234
Speaker 1: Putting my laptop away, getting ready to say, all right, guys, I'll see you tomorrow.

19
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,220
Speaker 1: 3.59, someone walks over.

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,688
Speaker 1: Hey, Rim, can you look at this real quick?

21
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:19,773
Speaker 1: This doesn't look right.

22
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:20,717
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,285
Speaker 1: Type, type, type, type, type, type.

24
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:24,713
Speaker 1: Look good, look good, fine.

25
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:24,974
Speaker 1: Bye.

26
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:25,899
Speaker 1: Run out the door.

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:37,241
Speaker 0: There needs to be sort of like a time, like if you come after, you could come to me after 3.30.

29
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,746
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't matter what it is.

30
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,131
Speaker 0: It could be the end of the company.

31
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:42,600
Speaker 0: I'm not, forget about it.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,505
Speaker 1: You know what's scary?

33
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,090
Speaker 1: I'll say this.

34
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,600
Speaker 0: It needs to be like a handoff period.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,900
Speaker 1: I actually like my company enough to where I would probably, if it was an emergency, stick around.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,960
Speaker 0: Well, my policy in my work is if it's something that is the cause of me, I will stay there and fix it.

37
00:01:57,342 --> 00:01:59,460
Speaker 0: If it's really important and you know we're losing money or whatever.

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:07,120
Speaker 1: I would also stay if I can fix it without, like if I wouldn't be able to do any better than anyone else at fixing it, then I probably wouldn't stay.

39
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,199
Speaker 1: But if it's something I could do or I know or I don't think anyone else could do it quickly, I would just do it.

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really depends on the thing, but I make a judgment call.

41
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,700
Speaker 0: If I feel responsible for it, I'll stay and do it.

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,418
Speaker 0: And if I don't, then I'll be like, all right, you take care of it.

43
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:21,720
Speaker 0: Bye.

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least with my work, we have this overlap.

45
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:27,900
Speaker 1: Like I work seven to four and this other guy works like 9.30 to 6.30.

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,266
Speaker 1: So we kind of overlap there.

47
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:32,700
Speaker 1: So if there's a big problem, he can usually cover it at the end of the day.

48
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:37,439
Speaker 1: And kind of the payback for that is that I got to be there in the morning when other things go wrong.

49
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,679
Speaker 0: See, we don't have things go wrong in the morning.

50
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:45,220
Speaker 1: It's more that I got to show up every morning at the crack as dawn and make sure everything's going to be OK.

51
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:46,646
Speaker 1: I turn on the lights.

52
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:47,672
Speaker 1: I pick up the mail.

53
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:48,738
Speaker 1: I do all that stuff, too.

54
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:49,100
Speaker 1: It's fun.

55
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:52,720
Speaker 0: My computers give it here tomorrow.

56
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:58,120
Speaker 0: I'm actually most of it's here now, except for the case, the CPU and the hard drives.

57
00:02:58,824 --> 00:02:59,799
Speaker 0: Sort of important parts.

58
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,119
Speaker 1: But actually, the reason we didn't do a show last night was Scott had one of those.

59
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:05,786
Speaker 1: All right, look at this.

60
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:06,770
Speaker 1: Fix it things.

61
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,360
Speaker 1: But he text messaged me while I'm on the train.

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,089
Speaker 1: It's like, I'm going to be late.

63
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,240
Speaker 1: But he didn't say how late.

64
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:14,854
Speaker 1: So I had a choice to make.

65
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:15,479
Speaker 1: All right.

66
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,759
Speaker 1: Do I query him to find out how late he will be and make plans accordingly to do the show?

67
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:25,819
Speaker 1: Or do I assume he's not coming home, totally go out to dinner with Emily and then hang out?

68
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,240
Speaker 1: So Scott finally did get home.

69
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,880
Speaker 0: You knew that if I'm late, it's going to be at least one train, which is already enough time to eat dinner and still do a show.

70
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if it was that, you probably wouldn't have even told me.

71
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:44,360
Speaker 1: Oh, I was looking for an excuse to not do the show because it's been.

72
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,980
Speaker 0: You're always like every day you're looking for an excuse to not do the show.

73
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:47,618
Speaker 1: Not today.

74
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:50,920
Speaker 0: It's only because you feel bad about not doing the show yesterday.

75
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,776
Speaker 0: You had a choice of being here and doing the show.

76
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:53,897
Speaker 0: Right.

77
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,780
Speaker 0: Or going outside and going, ah, would you sit here, do the show?

78
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,320
Speaker 0: Would you go outside?

79
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:01,759
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, I do have a choice.

80
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:02,657
Speaker 0: You do.

81
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:03,337
Speaker 0: And I'm here.

82
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,099
Speaker 0: No, but you feel obligated despite it.

83
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:08,560
Speaker 0: You know, they're not actually being a real obligation.

84
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:11,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have it created for yourself a duty.

85
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,000
Speaker 1: I think you forget that I get home like an hour before you.

86
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,560
Speaker 1: So I got home and then I went for this crazy long run and then I did all this other stuff outside.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,158
Speaker 1: So I'm kind of sated right now.

88
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,199
Speaker 0: Even still.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,340
Speaker 1: Plus, I got the window open right there despite all the noise going on out there.

90
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,159
Speaker 0: Anyway, what else we got going on?

91
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,633
Speaker 1: I don't know.

92
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,060
Speaker 1: Normally we talk about anime news or comic news, but is there any anime news or comic news that we care about?

93
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,939
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, there was this huge New York comic convention.

94
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:39,618
Speaker 0: All right.

95
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,559
Speaker 0: Whole weekend.

96
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:43,358
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of news from it.

97
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:46,700
Speaker 0: But really, I don't think any of it is news worthy.

98
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,658
Speaker 0: It's mostly we license this, we announce that, and it's all just kind of bled.

99
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,940
Speaker 0: There's nothing like, oh man, something to discuss or something awesome.

100
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,699
Speaker 0: It's mostly just...

101
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:03,040
Speaker 1: What could possibly... It'd have to be something crazy like, oh, by the way, they're making another Ghost in the Shell movie.

102
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,040
Speaker 1: Or like, oh, by the way, I don't know, something crazy.

103
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,060
Speaker 0: I mean, they could announce things that are actual news.

104
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,817
Speaker 0: Something interesting.

105
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,060
Speaker 1: Well, what's your line, though?

106
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,320
Speaker 1: I mean, there was interesting news.

107
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,080
Speaker 1: It's just it's not news that, while it may be interesting, there's not much for us to comment on.

108
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,700
Speaker 0: And it's not interesting if there's nothing for us to comment on.

109
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is.

110
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,940
Speaker 1: Because it's partly that we're not the first line of news.

111
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,240
Speaker 1: If you want to just find out what happened, like just the objective facts, just go read the Anime News Network.

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,000
Speaker 1: They'll tell you everything that got licensed and everything.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,720
Speaker 0: At least anime wise.

114
00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:32,304
Speaker 1: Yeah.

115
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,340
Speaker 1: And comic wise, you can find all that news.

116
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,220
Speaker 1: So we're not going to just say news that happens unless we have something personal to say about it.

117
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,422
Speaker 0: Right.

118
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,000
Speaker 0: And none of the news that happened.

119
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,700
Speaker 0: It was all just announcements of new things and boring shit like that.

120
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,460
Speaker 0: So there's no thing to discuss except for what happened.

121
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,041
Speaker 1: Yeah.

122
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,220
Speaker 1: Well, like I'm saying, that news wasn't interesting.

123
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,599
Speaker 0: Hence, it's not interesting news.

124
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,550
Speaker 1: Well, not to us personally.

125
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:56,120
Speaker 1: A lot of those shows people really cared about.

126
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:58,679
Speaker 0: I say if there's nothing to discuss...

127
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:01,393
Speaker 1: Alright, can you name one piece of these newses?

128
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:02,760
Speaker 1: Because I think you're just saying.

129
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,960
Speaker 0: There's that Stanley Manga thingy.

130
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,589
Speaker 1: Yeah?

131
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:07,795
Speaker 1: Yeah.

132
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,651
Speaker 1: That wasn't announced at the Comic Con.

133
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:10,899
Speaker 1: That was announced a long time ago.

134
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,980
Speaker 0: No, but it's like, you know, they show off stuff.

135
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,465
Speaker 1: But there was no news about it.

136
00:06:14,546 --> 00:06:17,960
Speaker 1: It was just, hey, just in case you forgot that thing's still coming.

137
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,099
Speaker 1: Had they announced it at the New York Comic Con?

138
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,140
Speaker 0: It was effectively like the, you know, they had said, you know, they basically said Stanley Ultimo.

139
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,570
Speaker 0: And then at the convention, like, okay, here it is.

140
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,433
Speaker 0: Here's the pictures.

141
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:31,040
Speaker 0: Here's all the more information, you know.

142
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,940
Speaker 1: But a lot of that information was already available.

143
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,344
Speaker 0: Oh, not really.

144
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:38,260
Speaker 0: And then, you know, it's like there were new trailers for TV shows and movies.

145
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:43,820
Speaker 0: And there's all sorts of news about new comics coming out from all the comic companies.

146
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:44,824
Speaker 0: We're making this.

147
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:45,707
Speaker 0: We're making that.

148
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:47,814
Speaker 0: We're making more graphic novels.

149
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,500
Speaker 0: We're making more Spidermans.

150
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,799
Speaker 0: You know, all that kind of bullshit.

151
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:54,020
Speaker 1: But had they actually announced the Ultimo thing, I would have had something to say.

152
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,839
Speaker 1: Again, I still have something to say because we never covered it.

153
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:57,779
Speaker 1: I'll say this about Ultimo.

154
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,040
Speaker 1: They're not selling or marketing or promoting Ultimo in any way.

155
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,280
Speaker 1: They are promoting, marketing, and selling Stan Lee's Ultimo.

156
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,380
Speaker 1: You look at this poster they had up and it was like, Stan Lee and the biggest letters they could fit.

157
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,086
Speaker 1: And a big picture of his face.

158
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:16,420
Speaker 1: And then much smaller than that, Ultimo coming soon.

159
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:18,419
Speaker 1: And then a picture of something from Ultimo.

160
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,380
Speaker 1: Obviously, this is gonna be some generic comic that is being sold primarily on the name Stan Lee.

161
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,823
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

162
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:29,873
Speaker 0: I predict not so good.

163
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:31,060
Speaker 0: What do you predict?

164
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:33,445
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna be average.

165
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:34,350
Speaker 1: I don't think it'll be bad.

166
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,113
Speaker 1: I don't think it'll be good.

167
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,520
Speaker 1: I think it'll be an average comic.

168
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,387
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not buying it.

169
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:38,700
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

170
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,877
Speaker 1: We gotta review it.

171
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:40,738
Speaker 0: No, we don't.

172
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:41,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do.

173
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,239
Speaker 0: Well, then you can go buy it.

174
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:43,919
Speaker 1: I'll acquire it somehow.

175
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,340
Speaker 0: Well, go to the comic book store next to the train station and buy it.

176
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,179
Speaker 1: No, someone will send it to me, I'm sure.

177
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:49,467
Speaker 0: I'm sure.

178
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,839
Speaker 0: Stan Lee's gonna send it to you?

179
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,399
Speaker 1: Not Stan Lee, but someone else will.

180
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,200
Speaker 0: Alright, we'll see about that.

181
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,890
Speaker 1: I mean, I've gotten so many crappy comics in the mail.

182
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,780
Speaker 1: I figure someday someone other than Vertical is gonna send us something good.

183
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I'm not buying it.

184
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,746
Speaker 1: Actually, it's scary.

185
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:07,200
Speaker 1: I mean, instead of doing news, we can talk a little bit about the New York Comic-Con.

186
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:13,360
Speaker 1: Unlike other conventions, we're not gonna dedicate an entire show to the New York Comic-Con.

187
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,640
Speaker 1: Because there's not nearly as much to say about it as I would have to say after going to say Otacon or Katsu-Con.

188
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,300
Speaker 0: Yep.

189
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:25,060
Speaker 0: But basically, New York Comic-Con, better than the pre- it's the third year, I think, yes.

190
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,605
Speaker 0: Yes, the third year of this con.

191
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,240
Speaker 0: And it was superior to the previous years.

192
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,917
Speaker 0: Unlike the first year, you could get in.

193
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:35,179
Speaker 0: Unlike the second year, there was more than one entrance.

194
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:36,779
Speaker 0: And there were wider aisles.

195
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:41,840
Speaker 0: So, it's actually, you know, the con is pretty much just one big room.

196
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,840
Speaker 0: And it's got, you know, dealing in one corner.

197
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,300
Speaker 0: It's got exhibitors in most of the space.

198
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:51,520
Speaker 0: It's got a big-ass artist alley in the other corner.

199
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:54,740
Speaker 0: And then there's a little stage with a bunch of chairs.

200
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,233
Speaker 0: And they sort of do random shit.

201
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:57,060
Speaker 0: that's just fucked up.

202
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,260
Speaker 1: I have things to say about that.

203
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:02,960
Speaker 0: And then behind the stage, hidden in the corner, is like a little podcast area.

204
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:10,380
Speaker 0: And it's just this giant, you know, it's like, I say, two-thirds of the main Javits room, right?

205
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:15,360
Speaker 0: And the aisles were even on, you know, we didn't go Saturday.

206
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:20,740
Speaker 0: But even on crowded Friday, you could sort of, at least as long as you weren't in the artist's alley, there was room to walk around.

207
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:23,599
Speaker 0: Sunday was nice and light, just kind of ahhh.

208
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:33,560
Speaker 0: And just like the year before, you go there, you walk around the big room, you see what there is to see, and there's no reason to hang around.

209
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:44,601
Speaker 0: Because most of the panels are pretty boring, except there was one panel that was Doug Rushkoff and Scott McCloud, but it was really early on Friday when I was not able to go at like 1 o'clock p.m There

210
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:56,539
Speaker 1: was also ICV2, which I didn't, if I'd taken the day off work, which I kind of wanted to because you get cocktails and stuff, and it looks like it's a pretty fun thing for a press person, but I wasn't going to take Thursday off of work for that.

211
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,818
Speaker 0: No, no, I wasn't.

212
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:00,520
Speaker 1: But pretty much, I do want to point out one thing.

213
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:17,140
Speaker 1: We had several listeners point out that this was like their first convention, and they seem to have a good time, but I do want to say that the New York Comic-Con is very typical of any sort of comic convention, but pretty much almost not in any way similar to an average anime convention.

214
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,420
Speaker 0: Well, see, I'm actually starting to realize, right?

215
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,960
Speaker 0: It doesn't have much to do with the subject matter of the convention.

216
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:26,940
Speaker 0: It has to do with whether it's fan-run or for-profit.

217
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:36,839
Speaker 0: There are for-profit anime cons besides the New York Anime Festival, and they're mostly just like a big, boring dealer's room.

218
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:44,320
Speaker 1: But not really to the extent of this because it seems like comic conventions in general, commercial or I don't know how many fan-run ones there are.

219
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:45,278
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's some.

220
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,900
Speaker 1: But they're so focused on the buying and the selling and that sort of thing that the biggest complaint...

221
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:00,060
Speaker 0: It is true that fan-run comic conventions are more focused on the buying, are more like for-profit other conventions.

222
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:11,958
Speaker 1: But the biggest complaint, the only main complaint I had about the New York Comic-Con was that everywhere I walked, unlike any other conventions I go to, and I remember this happened at Philly Wizard World too, people kept ramming into me.

223
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:13,713
Speaker 1: Now, there's crowds at anime conventions.

224
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Speaker 0: There were bigger aisles this year, despite there being, you know, they had a lot more stuff, but they had a lot more space, and the aisles were adequately wide.

225
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:35,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what I'm saying is that, you know, I was walking around this convention, like, I mean, Otakon has gigantic crowds and crazy crowds, and you can't walk anywhere, and Katsuokon's like that, but at all those anime conventions, I don't really get bumped into a lot.

226
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:52,140
Speaker 1: You just, like, everyone is kind of close together, but everyone's walking and nice orderly and da-da-da-da-da, and people are sitting in the sides, but at this convention and at Philly Wizard World and at the previous New York Comic Convention, I was rammed into by people, like, kind of hard a lot, constantly.

227
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:54,012
Speaker 0: No one rammed me that hard.

228
00:11:54,052 --> 00:11:56,259
Speaker 0: If someone did ram me that hard, I'd probably push them over.

229
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:10,120
Speaker 1: Well, no, you're really missing the point, not like ram you, like, to the point that they would knock you over, it would hurt, but running into me at a speed that was well above what is acceptable, and people were, like, swinging bags into me and onto other people, and I saw other people, the same thing.

230
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,160
Speaker 1: It's like everyone was kind of bumping into each other and bumping into tables and knocking stuff over.

231
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,000
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you have a giant room, right, and despite wide enough aisles, you've got a shit ton of people in this room.

232
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:25,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what I'm trying to point out is that there are things in every possible direction grabbing people's attention.

233
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:32,220
Speaker 1: What I'm trying to point out is that this doesn't happen at the dealer's rooms at anime cons I go to that are just as crowded, if not more so.

234
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,280
Speaker 0: Well, the dealer's room at an anime con isn't the whole con.

235
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:47,920
Speaker 0: It's one small part of the con, and it has smaller aisles, but it doesn't matter that it has smaller aisles because a smaller percentage of the con is in there at any one time, and there's also a lot less, like, attention-grabbing in different directions.

236
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,840
Speaker 0: It's straight aisles.

237
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,785
Speaker 0: Did you say that at all?

238
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,620
Speaker 1: It was straight aisles here, too, and there's the same thing.

239
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:53,779
Speaker 0: Not really.

240
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were straight aisles.

241
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,117
Speaker 0: The layout of the room wasn't a perfect grid, you know, like...

242
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:00,740
Speaker 1: There were a couple of minor variations.

243
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:03,980
Speaker 1: It's pretty much exactly the same as an anime con dealer's room.

244
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:05,759
Speaker 0: Eh, not really.

245
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:14,320
Speaker 1: The only difference, I think, because the dealer's room at Otakon is actually a lot more crowded than this place at any given moment.

246
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:37,680
Speaker 1: I think the difference is that anime cons, because they have these other places that aren't dealer's rooms, a lot of times at an anime con, you see people walking around who, they've already looked at stuff, and now they're just kind of chilling, and they're either looking for somewhere to sit down and chill, or they're kind of walking slowly off somewhere to chill in a nice, quiet area and hang out, and they're not just doing anything in particular, but at comic cons, there really aren't places to chill so much.

247
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:38,140
Speaker 0: The lobby?

248
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:41,900
Speaker 1: The lobby is it, and that's pretty far away from everything else.

249
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,160
Speaker 1: You gotta walk all the way out.

250
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,040
Speaker 0: Well, they had the beanbag area, and they had all the chairs by the stage.

251
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:52,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, those couple of areas on the far ends, but it seems like most people who were walking around weren't even looking at anything.

252
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:02,180
Speaker 1: They were just kind of walking slow, chilling, but because it's all just one big dealer's room, they were just kind of walking, chilling, in the middle of where everyone else was walking, trying to go somewhere.

253
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,959
Speaker 1: But even then, I don't understand why so many people bumped into me.

254
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:07,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't get it.

255
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,540
Speaker 1: Like, it was really, really apparent that people were bumping into me a lot more than any other public place I've ever been.

256
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,880
Speaker 0: Alright, well, I mean, there was some bumping going on, but I guess I didn't notice it as much as you did.

257
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,639
Speaker 1: It was just, well, you were ramming into me, too.

258
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:29,855
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, to the convention's credit, actually, they did have a whole area that we were able to find, even though it was far away from everything else, that had a whole bunch of panels, like 200-plus panels.

259
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,000
Speaker 0: The thing was, is except for a very small handful of the panels, I was completely not interested in any of them.

260
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,820
Speaker 1: Well, that's just, Scott, I was actually interested in quite a few of the panels.

261
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,540
Speaker 0: Well, I think most of the panels, though, were just so-and-so company, so-and-so other company.

262
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:49,056
Speaker 0: Not a lot of it was like, "Ooh, something actually

263
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:49,519
Speaker 0: interesting.".

264
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:50,066
Speaker 1: Like what?

265
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:50,980
Speaker 1: What would be interesting?

266
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,760
Speaker 0: Well, like that one panel I couldn't get to on Friday at one.

267
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,552
Speaker 1: Okay, so what else would be interesting?

268
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:56,480
Speaker 1: You were real vague there.

269
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,219
Speaker 0: People actually discussing something, as opposed to just advertising.

270
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,540
Speaker 1: A lot of those panels didn't look like they were just advertising.

271
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,659
Speaker 1: I mean, a lot of them did.

272
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:10,060
Speaker 0: I think the vast majority of them were just some company advertising their new thing.

273
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:12,160
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's your opinion.

274
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:13,975
Speaker 0: Go look at the list of panels.

275
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:14,279
Speaker 0: You'll see.

276
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there were a bunch I wanted to go to.

277
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,719
Speaker 1: Actually, I was really interested in checking out that black panel, but Scott really didn't want to go, so we left.

278
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,886
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wasn't.

279
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,580
Speaker 0: What would I want to go to the black panel for?

280
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,810
Speaker 1: I wanted to see what they had to say.

281
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,879
Speaker 1: There was a lot of people lined up.

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,700
Speaker 1: It looked interesting.

283
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, it didn't look too interesting to me.

284
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,959
Speaker 1: Okay, well, nothing ever looks interesting to you.

285
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,036
Speaker 0: But even so, okay, so that's two panels out of 200-plus.

286
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,360
Speaker 1: Actually, I really wanted to go to the Avatar panel, too.

287
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:38,420
Speaker 0: That's a company selling something panel.

288
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:43,640
Speaker 1: Well, it was something that I really want, and they were showing things that hadn't been seen before.

289
00:15:44,603 --> 00:16:00,220
Speaker 1: I failed to get an interview with those people, partly because everyone failed to get interviews with those people, because as far as I could tell, pretty much every single member of the press wanted an interview with anyone associated with Avatar, and as a result, no one really got interviews.

290
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,660
Speaker 1: In fact, the two creators, from what I hear, actually said, "Ah, never mind," and just kind of flew out early.

291
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:07,977
Speaker 0: Even so, right, that's three out of 200-plus.

292
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,620
Speaker 0: That's pretty sad.

293
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,420
Speaker 1: Well, I'm saying, of the time I was there, I can think of a couple more.

294
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,419
Speaker 1: They were all told maybe five or six panels that I probably would have wanted to go to, which is-- Out of 200 is really sad.

295
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:19,656
Speaker 0: Not necessarily.

296
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:22,100
Speaker 0: I mean, at an anime convention.

297
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,040
Speaker 0: Besides, not every anime convention.

298
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,900
Speaker 1: Not interesting to you or maybe to me, but there were panels where people-- If you're into these comics, there were people who have a lot to do with these comics.

299
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,211
Speaker 0: I guess that is true, is that-- That is true.

300
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,620
Speaker 1: I don't understand why you're so down on these panels.

301
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:41,820
Speaker 0: Because every time I went down there to look at the panel schedules, there's absolutely nothing I wanted to go to.

302
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,539
Speaker 1: Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

303
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:43,480
Speaker 1: Every time.

304
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,039
Speaker 1: You went down there once for like five minutes.

305
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,279
Speaker 0: I went down there three times.

306
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,539
Speaker 1: You went down there once for like five minutes with me.

307
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,839
Speaker 1: You walked past every time.

308
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,758
Speaker 1: Literally, you walked in, you're like, "Well, that sucks, that sucks, that sucks, let's

309
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:52,900
Speaker 1: leave.".

310
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,240
Speaker 0: But it wasn't just the panel that was currently in there that sucked.

311
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,540
Speaker 0: I looked at the entire schedule for the day, and I said, "Nothing in this room at all.

312
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,392
Speaker 0: Nothing in this room at

313
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:00,616
Speaker 0: all.".

314
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, and meanwhile, I actually wanted to stay for some, but Scott was getting impatient.

315
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,198
Speaker 0: What did you want to stay for?

316
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:07,079
Speaker 1: The Black Panel, among other things.

317
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:08,699
Speaker 1: And some of the ones I was walking by.

318
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,316
Speaker 1: There were pretty big crowds, and they were doing Q&A.

319
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,180
Speaker 1: Someone might ask an interesting question.

320
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

321
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:14,940
Speaker 0: Like in what, the DC panel?

322
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,760
Speaker 1: The DC panel that you refused to stay at for more than two minutes, so we only got to hear one question.

323
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:20,500
Speaker 0: It was just fan--.

324
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:22,859
Speaker 0: I heard like three questions that were all fanboys.

325
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:23,425
Speaker 1: Yeah.

326
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,059
Speaker 0: They were all fanboys asking stupid shit about like, "Oh, why didn't Superman do this?

327
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,272
Speaker 0: Why didn't Green Lantern do

328
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:29,536
Speaker 0: that?".

329
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,120
Speaker 1: There wasn't a single question like that.

330
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:32,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were.

331
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,478
Speaker 1: Actually, no.

332
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:47,439
Speaker 1: The only question we saw was, someone asked one question about like when a comic's coming out, and then the next question was the moderator actually asking the audience if any of them had like stopped reading comics, and then something got them to read comics again.

333
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:51,397
Speaker 1: And they were all telling like, "Well, I stopped reading when blah, like this

334
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:51,659
Speaker 1: year.".

335
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,776
Speaker 1: Or like, "When these superheroes got all weird, I didn't understand them anymore, and I never started reading

336
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:56,999
Speaker 1: again.".

337
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,097
Speaker 1: Or, "I started reading again because they reset

338
00:17:59,138 --> 00:17:59,299
Speaker 1: this.".

339
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,354
Speaker 1: Or, you know, "I just randomly picked up a comic, and actually it was kind of interesting, but Scott was like, "Eh, let's go, let's

340
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:04,576
Speaker 1: go.".

341
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,399
Speaker 0: It wasn't interesting because they were all talking about DC Universe BS, not comics as a whole BS.

342
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,959
Speaker 1: So it's not interesting to you?

343
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:11,459
Speaker 1: Yeah.

344
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,337
Speaker 1: What if you like DC?

345
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,120
Speaker 0: No, I don't like any of that shit.

346
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,268
Speaker 1: I like how you want to be.

347
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:19,720
Speaker 1: so, before the con, you're like, "Man, we got to be so objective with press.

348
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,513
Speaker 1: We got to be like, we got to cover things and be objective and serious

349
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:22,780
Speaker 1: business.".

350
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:26,240
Speaker 1: And all you did was walk around the con loudly proclaiming that everything sucked.

351
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's kind of hard.

352
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,320
Speaker 0: I realized I sort of had to have a press hat and a fan hat.

353
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,500
Speaker 1: But you never put on a press hat.

354
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,200
Speaker 1: Even when you were trying to film stuff.

355
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,760
Speaker 1: There's these Star Wars people that were fighting on stage.

356
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,580
Speaker 1: Scott was loudly saying, pretty much everyone in earshot would hear him going, "Wow, this is lame.

357
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:45,260
Speaker 1: Wow, these guys suck.

358
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:46,512
Speaker 1: Wow, this is so

359
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:47,079
Speaker 1: stupid.".

360
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:50,610
Speaker 1: Everyone was kind of turning around and looking at him like, "Seriously, what's your

361
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,096
Speaker 1: problem?".

362
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:53,600
Speaker 0: It was pretty lame though, you got to admit.

363
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,060
Speaker 1: While it was pretty lame, I thought you wanted to be objective press.

364
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,640
Speaker 0: I was wearing my fan hat at the time.

365
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,940
Speaker 1: I don't think you own a press hat.

366
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:02,000
Speaker 0: I got to get one.

367
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,120
Speaker 0: I don't think you own one.

368
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,959
Speaker 0: It's very easy.

369
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:06,580
Speaker 0: It's one thing to know what to do.

370
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,919
Speaker 0: It's much harder to actually do what you know what to do.

371
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,255
Speaker 0: Technically, I academically can get a book that says, "Aha, this is how to draw a beautiful

372
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:16,818
Speaker 0: picture."

373
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,460
Speaker 0: And it's another thing to actually draw a beautiful picture.

374
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:24,800
Speaker 1: But in regards to the Star Wars thing, while I don't quite have the venom that I guess Scott had for these people.

375
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,439
Speaker 0: I don't have venom.

376
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:33,420
Speaker 0: I just think it's really lame and it's kind of sad watching these people sort of act like they're legitimate and cool and worthy of respect.

377
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:38,440
Speaker 0: When they're just a bunch of like really sad adults acting like little children.

378
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,180
Speaker 1: But once, Scott, they were like teenagers, all of them.

379
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,399
Speaker 0: No, that guy was like 20-something for sure.

380
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:45,780
Speaker 1: No, he definitely wasn't.

381
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,440
Speaker 0: No, definitely was.

382
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,840
Speaker 1: And most of the people on stage were clearly in high school.

383
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,099
Speaker 0: No, that's how it looked like to me.

384
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:51,800
Speaker 1: Okay.

385
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,426
Speaker 0: Yeah.

386
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,860
Speaker 0: Why don't we go find out exactly how old those people were.

387
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,574
Speaker 0: They were definitely most of them in their 20s.

388
00:19:58,744 --> 00:19:59,859
Speaker 0: If not 30-some of them.

389
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,266
Speaker 1: I disagree with you pretty much 100%.

390
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:02,475
Speaker 1: Yeah.

391
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,618
Speaker 1: You've got your film.

392
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,840
Speaker 1: Go pull the film out and put it on YouTube or something.

393
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:08,860
Speaker 0: It's a really bad film because I suck at the camera.

394
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,120
Speaker 0: Yeah.

395
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:20,780
Speaker 0: I have the same problem with the video camera that I have with the photo camera in that I carry it and I want to video things but I just, I don't.

396
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:23,540
Speaker 1: Well, I kept telling you two and you kept putting the camera away.

397
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,070
Speaker 1: I'd be like, "Scott, film

398
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,272
Speaker 1: this.".

399
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,680
Speaker 1: You put the camera away.

400
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,459
Speaker 1: By the time he fumbles it out, the thing's over.

401
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,360
Speaker 1: And then he immediately puts the camera back away.

402
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I had, well, because carrying it, first of all, is very annoying.

403
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,320
Speaker 1: Dude, I had the Marantz and the microphone and all that business.

404
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,379
Speaker 0: That's easier to carry.

405
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:38,100
Speaker 0: Not really.

406
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,079
Speaker 0: Because you don't, yeah it is.

407
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,920
Speaker 1: It's actually heavier than that camera.

408
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,940
Speaker 0: It's not about the weight.

409
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,020
Speaker 1: The microphone itself is heavier than the camera.

410
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:46,260
Speaker 1: I had that big XLR cable.

411
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,080
Speaker 1: Thing was jangling around, hit me in the thigh.

412
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:50,300
Speaker 1: I had to keep fiddling with the radio and I was-.

413
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,939
Speaker 0: The point is that if I'm using the camera, I have to like have my hand in front of my face and I can't like do anything else.

414
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,960
Speaker 0: I can't like talk or look around or anything.

415
00:20:59,161 --> 00:20:59,440
Speaker 0: Okay.

416
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,900
Speaker 0: Like you can interview someone and look around and walk.

417
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,440
Speaker 1: Not really.

418
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,119
Speaker 1: I pretty much have to stare constantly at the meters and keep adjusting the levels.

419
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,540
Speaker 0: Nah, it's not necessary.

420
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:09,520
Speaker 1: Actually it's very necessary.

421
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,660
Speaker 1: I've gotten a lot better at that.

422
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,780
Speaker 1: That's why the short interview clip I have with the International Office of French Publishers, I think, publications.

423
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:19,159
Speaker 1: I forget exactly.

424
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,300
Speaker 1: It sounds really good, but all the interviews I did at every con before sounds awful.

425
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:38,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, this isn't helping people, but basically if you like comics at all, right, and you're near New York, if you're far away, but if you're near enough to New York, it's probably worth your time to go to the New York Comic Con one of the days.

426
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,955
Speaker 0: I suggest either Friday night or Sunday.

427
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:43,239
Speaker 0: Saturday's probably not worth it.

428
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,819
Speaker 0: And just go around, look at all the stuff, and then go home.

429
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:49,159
Speaker 0: And that's worth it.

430
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,620
Speaker 0: But otherwise, it's really not so much worth it.

431
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:54,060
Speaker 1: I can say one thing.

432
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,400
Speaker 1: On Friday I saw probably the best Avatar cosplayers I've ever seen.

433
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:05,260
Speaker 1: It was one of those groups of people where obviously they got all their friends who kind of already look like characters.

434
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:09,480
Speaker 1: We have a friend who looks exactly like a character from Bleach.

435
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,060
Speaker 1: So if she cosplays as that character, it looks like this crazy amazing cosplay.

436
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,820
Speaker 1: But all of these kids looked exactly like the people in Avatar.

437
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:27,780
Speaker 1: Furthermore, they dressed up in Fire Nation, which is kind of like what they're wearing in the third season, and it was totally awesome.

438
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,140
Speaker 1: I talked to them briefly.

439
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,160
Speaker 1: I didn't give them a flyer because I didn't want to reach into my bag, but if you guys somehow find Geek Nights, you guys were totally awesome.

440
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,420
Speaker 1: Especially whoever it was who was in that gigantic Appa costume.

441
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,034
Speaker 0: I bet you if you hadn't suddenly become like an Avatar fanboy, you wouldn't even notice them.

442
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,160
Speaker 1: Suddenly become.

443
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,800
Speaker 1: I've wanted, pretty much as long as I've known about Avatar, I've known it was good.

444
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,816
Speaker 1: And now that I've actually watched it, I just confirmed that it was as good as I thought it was.

445
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,420
Speaker 1: In fact, a little better than I expected.

446
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:55,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

447
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:56,300
Speaker 0: Anyway.

448
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:59,499
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't know what it is, why you hate Avatar.

449
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:01,000
Speaker 0: I don't hate Avatar.

450
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,994
Speaker 0: It's just from what I've seen, it's.

451
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,620
Speaker 1: Which is nothing.

452
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:05,920
Speaker 0: I've seen enough.

453
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:06,217
Speaker 0: Yeah.

454
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,480
Speaker 0: It really seems like a kid's show that a lot of people like.

455
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:15,060
Speaker 0: And while I'm not going to pass a judgment on it until actually seeing it.

456
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,680
Speaker 1: But what have you seen?

457
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,834
Speaker 1: You walked past the TV.

458
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,559
Speaker 0: I have no expectation for it.

459
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,440
Speaker 0: And I have a lot of things above it in the queue.

460
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,919
Speaker 0: And I have no reason to have a high expectation of it.

461
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,344
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

462
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,440
Speaker 1: Despite the fact, you see, because you poo-pooed like this book you're reading now.

463
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,000
Speaker 1: I didn't poo-poo it.

464
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,859
Speaker 0: No, you very clearly poo-pooed it.

465
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,379
Speaker 0: I didn't poo-poo.

466
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:32,840
Speaker 0: I passed no judgment.

467
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,040
Speaker 0: And I said, I'll get to it eventually.

468
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:37,400
Speaker 0: And eventually, I got to it.

469
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:39,060
Speaker 0: Yeah.

470
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:40,599
Speaker 1: So can I, all right.

471
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,880
Speaker 1: Well, I guess you hated the comic convention at least.

472
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:43,977
Speaker 0: I didn't hate it.

473
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,000
Speaker 1: You hated all the panels and everything on stage.

474
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,011
Speaker 0: No, it was --.

475
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:50,560
Speaker 1: Well, you already said you didn't like all the panels.

476
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,059
Speaker 1: No, the panels -- And everything on that stage.

477
00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:57,399
Speaker 0: The handful of panels that I wanted to go to, I couldn't go to.

478
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:03,120
Speaker 0: For having 200 panels, a very small percentage of them were non-advertising panels.

479
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:12,420
Speaker 0: But no matter what, if you're interested in something geeky, there probably were, you know, like five panels there for you at least, because they were just such a quantity.

480
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,859
Speaker 0: You'll be interested in at least a handful of them.

481
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,620
Speaker 0: But when is that handful going to be scheduled?

482
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:22,698
Speaker 0: You know, you'd have to figure out, you know, look at the schedule ahead of time and go at that, you know, when they were going to be.

483
00:24:23,603 --> 00:24:25,300
Speaker 0: And usually, they probably wouldn't be grouped up.

484
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:35,959
Speaker 0: So like, you know, if out of the 200 panels, there were five you were interested in, you know, good luck actually getting to more than one of them, because that would require going all three days, which is way too long to spend at this thing.

485
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:42,020
Speaker 1: Well, I can at least say one thing that Scott probably won't argue with like everything else, and those kids were totally in high school.

486
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,460
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'm glad we didn't bother getting a table at this time.

487
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:57,399
Speaker 1: And I think other than Otacon, where we're doing something kind of awesome with the front row crew and Katsucon, where we pretty much set like set up like the entire front of the video game room.

488
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:00,860
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm going to bother getting tables at conventions ever again.

489
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,940
Speaker 1: Like, it seems like, yeah, completely not worth it unless we're selling swag.

490
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,660
Speaker 0: I see no reason to get a table at the convention.

491
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,360
Speaker 1: But even then, I'm not really going to sit at the table.

492
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:11,699
Speaker 1: I'll hire someone to sell the swag.

493
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:12,560
Speaker 0: No, yeah.

494
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,378
Speaker 0: You know, but I'd be at the table maybe like for scheduled times, you know, and that's actually something else.

495
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,499
Speaker 0: The artist's alley was really big.

496
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:22,640
Speaker 0: And last year the artist's alley was small and too crowded.

497
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:22,999
Speaker 0: Right.

498
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:23,878
Speaker 0: So it was much better.

499
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:30,700
Speaker 0: And last year, the artist's alley at this convention was basically all like A-list people, like holy shit people.

500
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:31,199
Speaker 0: Right.

501
00:25:31,522 --> 00:25:33,500
Speaker 0: Which has also contributed to its crowdedness.

502
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:38,660
Speaker 0: This year, there were still some holy shit people in the artist's alley, but not as many.

503
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:39,260
Speaker 0: Right.

504
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:43,140
Speaker 0: And there were plenty of, you know, B-list awesome people.

505
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,920
Speaker 0: They were still awesome.

506
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,959
Speaker 0: They just weren't, you know, A-list famous people in there.

507
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:57,160
Speaker 0: But other than like the peak hours, I'd say like up to 40 percent of the artist's alley, just no one was at their tables and there were empty tables all over the place.

508
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,780
Speaker 0: Like on Sunday, a lot of the tables are empty, you know, so it was either too crowded.

509
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,080
Speaker 0: You can't really look at anything or it's not crowded now.

510
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:08,139
Speaker 0: Oh, there's like people missing.

511
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:09,380
Speaker 0: I can't see their shit.

512
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:19,420
Speaker 0: So like there was awesome stuff in the artist's alley, but I barely even got to see anyone in the artist's alley because they either weren't there when I was there or it was too crowded.

513
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,916
Speaker 0: I couldn't get through and it wasn't worth it.

514
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:24,360
Speaker 1: But there was one absolutely awesome thing at the con.

515
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:30,280
Speaker 1: On Saturday night, TM Revolution had his concert, which went crazily well.

516
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:31,558
Speaker 0: Except we weren't there.

517
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:33,920
Speaker 1: Well, because we ended up having to skip Saturday.

518
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,940
Speaker 1: You had to miss anyway because your family stuff.

519
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:36,864
Speaker 0: Yeah, they put the.

520
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:42,400
Speaker 0: they put the convention on Passover, which is, you know, you know, I'm an atheist Jew, so it's not the biggest deal.

521
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:42,782
Speaker 0: Right.

522
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:46,300
Speaker 0: I wasn't like, oh, no, I'm going to Jew hell, which doesn't exist.

523
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:49,440
Speaker 0: But, you know, my family was eating dinner.

524
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,538
Speaker 0: It's like, huh, free dinner with family convention.

525
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,560
Speaker 0: I'm spending a whole bunch of time for free anyway.

526
00:26:57,521 --> 00:26:58,657
Speaker 0: TMR who I've already seen.

527
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:00,660
Speaker 0: OK, I'll go get the free awesome.

528
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,819
Speaker 1: But anyway, the main event for us, like because we weren't even going to go to the New York Comic Con, but we were kind of roped into it.

529
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:22,359
Speaker 1: But the reason for all that was that on Sunday TM Revolution talking to our Nishikawa himself came to the Kinokuniya on because, you know, we set up this thing because we talked about this way back, but we're friends with the people here who'd work for like Tokyo FM.

530
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,518
Speaker 0: And they were like, Brian, I think the company's GIO.

531
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:25,062
Speaker 0: Right.

532
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:25,505
Speaker 0: Yeah.

533
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:27,680
Speaker 1: But they worked like they do stuff for Tokyo FM.

534
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,199
Speaker 1: You know, the radio station in Tokyo.

535
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:29,782
Speaker 1: Yeah.

536
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:33,120
Speaker 1: And Brian Nishi is a host of this awesome baseball show.

537
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,380
Speaker 1: If I if I was a baseball fan and I understood Japanese, this would be the show to listen to.

538
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, seriously.

539
00:27:40,002 --> 00:27:45,020
Speaker 1: This here in this energy, especially because, you know, the Japanese baseball is big to them.

540
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:45,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty big.

541
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:47,700
Speaker 0: They don't have, you know, some of the other sports.

542
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,940
Speaker 0: They don't have ice hockey, really.

543
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,477
Speaker 1: Like baseball in Japan is the way hockey is.

544
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,696
Speaker 0: They don't have basketball.

545
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,020
Speaker 1: Baseball in Japan is as big as hockey is to me personally.

546
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

547
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:05,640
Speaker 1: But so this was set up to where basically TMR came to the Kinokuniya for this big event.

548
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,700
Speaker 1: And by the way, the upstairs was completely filled to capacity with fans.

549
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,930
Speaker 1: It was kind of shelves.

550
00:28:11,132 --> 00:28:12,020
Speaker 1: It was kind of crazy.

551
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,660
Speaker 0: Smart fans would have sat in the Zaya.

552
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:21,640
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, it was tough to get in there because people had already had this idea and parked themselves in the Zaya well before this event.

553
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not sure, though, how many people in the Zaya were parked for the event and how many just happened to be in there.

554
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:33,920
Speaker 1: Well, I think next time what the Kinokuniya should probably do is try to work out a deal where the Zaya closes that part and doesn't sell.

555
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,940
Speaker 1: But instead, they like sell snacks to people throughout the whole store for that one time or something.

556
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:46,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, they need to make a deal with them because then you could actually put the, you know, like the people in the Zaya or something like that or have seating in there or something, you know, something.

557
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:55,760
Speaker 1: But basically he came and there was an interview where he was the guest and he was interviewed by Brian Nishi and also interviewed by us.

558
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,440
Speaker 1: We were brought up as like the big anime fans from America with the award winning, amazing anime podcast.

559
00:29:02,303 --> 00:29:05,160
Speaker 1: And we were brought up there and we got to ask him three questions.

560
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:06,839
Speaker 1: And I got to say a couple of things.

561
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:16,980
Speaker 1: One, this guy Takanori Nishikawa, like the per pound energy in this band is like off the charts.

562
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,200
Speaker 0: Well, either, right?

563
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:24,420
Speaker 0: First of all, they had a booth at the Comic-Con for TMR, right?

564
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:26,880
Speaker 0: And they had some of his clothes there, like on mannequins.

565
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,500
Speaker 1: Now we'd seen him in concert.

566
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,020
Speaker 0: But we were far away.

567
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:40,300
Speaker 1: And also he looked really tall and really big because, you know, when you're on stage and you're kind of like out in front of everyone else, like in front of the backup people and there's the lights, you look larger than life.

568
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,340
Speaker 0: Especially when someone is so far away.

569
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,140
Speaker 1: But even up close, you look like this kind of epic figure.

570
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:45,701
Speaker 0: Yep.

571
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:51,400
Speaker 0: In reality, TMR is a very, very, very small man.

572
00:29:51,882 --> 00:29:53,600
Speaker 0: He is incredibly small.

573
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,800
Speaker 0: Like, holy shit, is he small.

574
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,180
Speaker 1: He is very pretty.

575
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:08,300
Speaker 1: And in fact, multiple of the questions that were asked to him by people in the audience were related to, so how do you get your hair to look that way and how do you look so good and stuff like that.

576
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:16,540
Speaker 1: Of course, I think I like this guy a lot because unlike the majority of interviews with Japanese stars I've heard, he gave some pretty funny answers.

577
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, either.

578
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:21,640
Speaker 0: He's like just really good, like a really great actor.

579
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:23,839
Speaker 0: And he knew like awesome answers to say.

580
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:28,240
Speaker 0: You know, it's always tough to tell when a famous person is genuine.

581
00:30:28,906 --> 00:30:30,260
Speaker 0: You always have to have some skepticism.

582
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:33,840
Speaker 0: You know, like, are they just really good at pretending they love all their fans?

583
00:30:34,342 --> 00:30:36,500
Speaker 0: Or do they actually love all their fans and are awesome?

584
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,540
Speaker 0: And, you know, it doesn't really matter because you never know the person in real life.

585
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,000
Speaker 0: So it doesn't matter if they're genuine or not.

586
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:48,080
Speaker 0: What matters is they're awesome and providing the entertainment that you're looking for because they're an entertainer.

587
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:54,860
Speaker 1: The thing is, though, I think he's genuine because actually one of the questions we asked, because it turns out that a long time ago he used to do a radio show.

588
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,773
Speaker 1: It was like Takador Nishikawa's.

589
00:30:56,954 --> 00:30:57,740
Speaker 1: All Night Nippon.

590
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,279
Speaker 0: All Night Nippon.

591
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,939
Speaker 1: It was funny because we printed it out.

592
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Speaker 0: And it was question mark, are you Night Nippon?

593
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,980
Speaker 1: Well, it was Naito, too.

594
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,180
Speaker 1: So I was like, what is this?

595
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:08,979
Speaker 1: It was in Romaji.

596
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,958
Speaker 1: It was like, all right, what is this?

597
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:12,140
Speaker 1: Why did Google cut off this character?

598
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:12,568
Speaker 1: What was it?

599
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,060
Speaker 0: Is it like Iru Naito Nippon?

600
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,899
Speaker 1: Because, you know, we're dumb.

601
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,160
Speaker 1: And we show it to people who speak Japanese.

602
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,076
Speaker 1: They're like, no, all night.

603
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:22,040
Speaker 1: Oh, you know, all night.

604
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,700
Speaker 0: We're like, ah, oh, nice on the phone.

605
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:29,299
Speaker 1: But apparently, like he did this radio show and he loved doing it.

606
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:33,459
Speaker 1: And he only stopped because he kind of got so famous that he had no time to keep doing it.

607
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:38,900
Speaker 1: And I think it's if nothing else, the energy that guy has is definitely genuine.

608
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

609
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,459
Speaker 0: Definitely.

610
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,380
Speaker 0: He seems to enjoy what he's doing.

611
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,619
Speaker 1: The coolest thing is we asked him, like, you know, because he actually voice acted in Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny.

612
00:31:50,072 --> 00:31:50,239
Speaker 1: Yeah.

613
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,620
Speaker 1: Like he played minor like Gundam pilots.

614
00:31:53,221 --> 00:32:05,040
Speaker 1: And he answered the question around by way where he basically said, you know, if you'd gone to me when I was a kid and told me that I would have effectively had my very own Gundam, I probably would have peed myself.

615
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:07,550
Speaker 1: And then he proceeds to make a motion of.

616
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:11,340
Speaker 0: he does like a hand gesture showing like, you know, he's like, yeah, peed all over the place.

617
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,960
Speaker 1: Like the pea would have just gone everywhere.

618
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:13,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

619
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,660
Speaker 0: So, yeah, he definitely is a funny guy.

620
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:19,957
Speaker 0: He's pretty cool.

621
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:20,580
Speaker 0: Yeah.

622
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,119
Speaker 0: Whether you like his music or not, because, you know, not everyone likes that kind of music.

623
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,600
Speaker 0: Whether you like Gundam or not, it doesn't matter either.

624
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:28,820
Speaker 0: He is a pretty awesome person.

625
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,920
Speaker 1: Not just Gundam, he's done music for other shows.

626
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:33,219
Speaker 0: He's done music for plenty of things.

627
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,100
Speaker 1: And actually, Walt TMR is like this very specific kind of music.

628
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:44,820
Speaker 1: He's also involved in this other project called the Abingdon Boys School, which if you if that name sounds familiar, think Radiohead.

629
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:47,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, he started another band.

630
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,840
Speaker 0: Right.

631
00:32:48,481 --> 00:32:53,617
Speaker 0: And he named called it Abingdon Boys School, which is the school that Radiohead, you know, started in.

632
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,560
Speaker 0: So it's like an all boys school in, you know, England, Albion somewhere.

633
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,900
Speaker 0: So he must.

634
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:00,919
Speaker 1: What the hell is England?

635
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,980
Speaker 0: He must be a Radiohead fan of some sort.

636
00:33:04,127 --> 00:33:04,340
Speaker 0: Right.

637
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:08,120
Speaker 0: That would be like if I made a band and I called it Strawberry Fields.

638
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,860
Speaker 1: I really wanted to ask him about it, but because of time limitations, we only were able to ask him like three questions.

639
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,240
Speaker 0: Basically, we submitted a bunch of questions, you know, and we decided, OK, well, it doesn't matter what questions we submit.

640
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:25,900
Speaker 0: You know, if they have a high probability of actually getting making the cut or a low probability, doesn't matter.

641
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:34,119
Speaker 0: You know, that way we can stick to our principle of ask hard questions, but then someone else decides which questions we're actually going to be able to ask.

642
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,880
Speaker 1: The thing is though, what hard question can you ask him?

643
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,340
Speaker 1: It's like, all right, so you're a musician.

644
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:48,359
Speaker 0: I would go online and I'd research and find like his harshest critic and then like, you know, say, what do you think of, you know, this critic saying such and such about you?

645
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,039
Speaker 0: The worst thing I can say.

646
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:55,160
Speaker 0: I could have asked, you know, hey, your music is only popular because you attach it to popular anime.

647
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,360
Speaker 0: Do you think that your music would be popular if you didn't attach it to any anime?

648
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, except the answer based on Japan is already yes, very much.

649
00:34:02,043 --> 00:34:02,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

650
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,760
Speaker 1: But I'm just you can ask that kind of question.

651
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,699
Speaker 1: One thing I find very interesting about TMR is that it's popular in America.

652
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,556
Speaker 1: It seems like half of the people who know about TMR in America know about him because of Gundam seed.

653
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,150
Speaker 1: But the other half of these people are.

654
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:24,320
Speaker 1: there's a lot of people, especially in New York City, who are fans of Japanese music, like particularly J-Rock or J-Pop.

655
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,319
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, metal.

656
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,458
Speaker 1: And they are fans of him.

657
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:28,920
Speaker 1: They don't even know he was in Gundam.

658
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:29,474
Speaker 1: They don't care.

659
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,320
Speaker 0: Well, they know he was in Gundam.

660
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,058
Speaker 1: But they're not.

661
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,320
Speaker 1: Some of them I don't think did.

662
00:34:33,762 --> 00:34:35,699
Speaker 0: Well, maybe a few didn't, but even so.

663
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,139
Speaker 1: You can tell the J-Rockers in the audience as opposed to the anime fans.

664
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,039
Speaker 0: You could definitely.

665
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:40,906
Speaker 1: It was like this 40/40 mix.

666
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:51,360
Speaker 1: And then the other 20% were actually, I don't know the deal, but it seemed like a bunch of people in Japan won this contest or something where they came with him to America to see the concert.

667
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:56,719
Speaker 1: And there were all these Japanese schoolgirls like lined up outside the glass, like watching and yelling.

668
00:34:57,732 --> 00:34:58,399
Speaker 1: It was pretty funny.

669
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:00,020
Speaker 0: How long have we gone?

670
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:01,740
Speaker 1: We should wrap this up.

671
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,118
Speaker 1: The one last thing I got to say, and Scott will probably think this is lame, but I can't believe that.

672
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:07,760
Speaker 1: I mean, I shook hands with TMR.

673
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,040
Speaker 1: I was up there on stage with him.

674
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,758
Speaker 1: It was pretty cool.

675
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:18,497
Speaker 1: And he even like said, I give it like a 75% chance that he was serious, that he will listen to or at least check out what Geek Nights is.

676
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:23,380
Speaker 1: But beyond that, he high fived us again on his way out.

677
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:27,520
Speaker 1: And then I got to kind of give the second hand five five to all the people behind me.

678
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:29,979
Speaker 1: And I think that was pretty cool.

679
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:39,460
Speaker 1: Are you like, yeah, it's just a person unlike you who is jaded about everything in the world and everything is met.

680
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:49,534
Speaker 0: Unlike me, unlike you, who is not a teenage 13 year old girl who thinks that touching someone is like somehow magical and then touching somebody to touch someone is like magic rubbing off.

681
00:35:50,286 --> 00:35:51,079
Speaker 1: It pretty much is.

682
00:35:51,222 --> 00:35:52,200
Speaker 0: No, not really.

683
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,639
Speaker 1: Concentrated magic that came off his hand and as cool a guy as he is.

684
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:57,222
Speaker 0: Right.

685
00:35:57,282 --> 00:36:05,059
Speaker 0: And as fun as he was and as awesome as the event was, he's just a dude, a really small dude, but a cool small dude.

686
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,340
Speaker 0: And he's not magical.

687
00:36:07,521 --> 00:36:09,940
Speaker 0: And high fiving him is not special.

688
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,607
Speaker 0: Yes, it is.

689
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:11,159
Speaker 1: And you suck.

690
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:12,320
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

691
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,520
Speaker 0: You're just mad about everything.

692
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,200
Speaker 0: I'm not a 13 year old girl.

693
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,146
Speaker 1: Whatever.

694
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:18,020
Speaker 1: I think it was awesome.

695
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,580
Speaker 1: But I can at least tell you all this is it won't be terribly useful.

696
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:24,619
Speaker 1: I'm going to see if we can get permission to get the audio of this thing.

697
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:39,339
Speaker 1: But if nothing else, if you really want to hear us asking TM Revolution some questions, it will be aired on Tokyo FM in the Tokyo, like, you know, metropolitan area at midnight, Eastern Daylight Time on Saturday.

698
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:40,699
Speaker 0: That's terrific.

699
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:52,880
Speaker 0: So maybe our friend Altimo Spalpin recorded someone driving late at night, you know, from down Mount Akina will turn on the radio and they'll hear geek nights.

700
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:55,879
Speaker 1: And the second time we've been on the radio in Japan.

701
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,861
Speaker 0: All right.

702
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:06,930
Speaker 0: Do you want to do the thing or go on the things of the day anyway?

703
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,790
Speaker 1: Despite the fact that Scott doesn't understand the magic things of the day.

704
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:11,197
Speaker 0: Yeah.

705
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:11,462
Speaker 0: OK.

706
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:11,950
Speaker 1: Yeah.

707
00:37:12,212 --> 00:37:12,617
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

708
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:13,769
Speaker 1: You're not excited about things.

709
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:15,537
Speaker 0: We better call Randy.

710
00:37:15,577 --> 00:37:18,312
Speaker 0: then if it's the magic rubbed off on you, we can go get a million dollars.

711
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:20,722
Speaker 0: Then you can go fly to Japan and high five again is in the bag.

712
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:25,070
Speaker 1: Anyway, so this has been going around the Internet.

713
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,217
Speaker 1: I'm sure a lot of you've seen it, but there's this video of a guy who was stuck in an elevator for 41 hours.

714
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:32,673
Speaker 0: Wow.

715
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:34,250
Speaker 0: That now that really sucks.

716
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,769
Speaker 0: And it's basically the guys going nuts.

717
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:37,969
Speaker 0: And I would also go nuts.

718
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:43,488
Speaker 1: I particularly like how he cracked open the door and peed down the shaft because that's pretty much the only thing you can do.

719
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:44,257
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

720
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:45,409
Speaker 0: I'm surprised he didn't poop.

721
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:46,518
Speaker 0: Did he not eat?

722
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:47,850
Speaker 0: Well, I wonder what was up with that.

723
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:49,970
Speaker 1: I can go a couple days without poop.

724
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:50,803
Speaker 1: And if I have to.

725
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:51,026
Speaker 1: Yeah.

726
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,730
Speaker 0: But I mean, if I had to poop like it would, you know, it could cause some problems.

727
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:58,710
Speaker 1: Well, if I had to poop, I would also see hydration starts to become a serious problem.

728
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,505
Speaker 0: He probably would have been better off drinking his pee now.

729
00:38:01,731 --> 00:38:03,730
Speaker 1: Forty one hours is not so long.

730
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,686
Speaker 1: And you're going to get that.

731
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:04,910
Speaker 0: Yeah.

732
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,555
Speaker 0: But how long?

733
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:07,350
Speaker 0: He didn't know it was only forty one hours.

734
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:09,730
Speaker 1: Now he did because he got stuck.

735
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:10,394
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

736
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,490
Speaker 1: I don't want to dwell on this.

737
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,423
Speaker 1: We've already gone on long.

738
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:13,789
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

739
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,295
Speaker 0: We got to keep.

740
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:15,550
Speaker 0: this video was everywhere.

741
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:19,510
Speaker 1: And a lot of people were saying it was fake or it was staged or it was some sort of like.

742
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:21,566
Speaker 1: that's cool, but you couldn't be stuck there for 41 hours.

743
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:29,376
Speaker 1: If you did a little bit of research, this happened once, like in like 1990 something, this is old, but to.

744
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:36,190
Speaker 1: what happened was he was working late on Friday, went for a smoke break, came back up and got stuck.

745
00:38:36,632 --> 00:38:38,749
Speaker 1: No one came back to the building until Monday.

746
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,786
Speaker 0: Well, number one deserves it.

747
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:41,210
Speaker 0: Smoker.

748
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:43,613
Speaker 0: Yeah.

749
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:45,470
Speaker 0: Number two, where was the cell phone?

750
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:47,710
Speaker 1: He left it upstairs because he just went down for a smoke.

751
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,749
Speaker 0: See, I keep my cell phone on me at all times.

752
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,390
Speaker 1: See, I often don't know.

753
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:53,370
Speaker 0: It's about you're getting stuck in an elevator.

754
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,090
Speaker 1: Number three, I have been stuck in an elevator before.

755
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,029
Speaker 1: I was stuck in an elevator for over an hour once.

756
00:38:58,952 --> 00:39:01,130
Speaker 1: Number three, IBM with one of my co-workers.

757
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:04,350
Speaker 1: We're in an elevator ride and it's going down and we're going.

758
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,243
Speaker 0: You want to hurry this up?

759
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:05,610
Speaker 1: It was going.

760
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,750
Speaker 1: The elevator is going down and it stops and we look at each other.

761
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,889
Speaker 1: We're like, no fucking way.

762
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,690
Speaker 0: So you push the emergency button?

763
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:13,074
Speaker 1: No.

764
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:14,189
Speaker 1: And then it goes again.

765
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:14,773
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

766
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:20,249
Speaker 1: And then we get off and then I get back in the elevator with the car to go back up by myself and it stops.

767
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:21,338
Speaker 1: And I go, ha ha.

768
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:22,809
Speaker 1: And then it doesn't go.

769
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:26,330
Speaker 0: And you push the emergency button and it didn't do anything.

770
00:39:27,172 --> 00:39:27,878
Speaker 0: So that's the problem.

771
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:28,989
Speaker 0: Those buttons are supposed to do so.

772
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:31,010
Speaker 1: A lot of them just make a bell ring.

773
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,950
Speaker 1: But if no one's around to hear the bell, then you're fucked.

774
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,190
Speaker 0: So that's those buttons are supposed to, like, call the fire department.

775
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:37,159
Speaker 1: Most of them don't.

776
00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:37,950
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

777
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,116
Speaker 1: But most of them don't.

778
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:39,840
Speaker 0: Well, we need to make some.

779
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:41,410
Speaker 1: a lot of the older ones.

780
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:45,575
Speaker 1: They ring a bell outside the building that says, hey, someone stuck in an elevator in this building.

781
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:46,710
Speaker 0: But that's a little better.

782
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,430
Speaker 1: But most no one knows what that bell is.

783
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:52,233
Speaker 1: If I'm walking in Manhattan and I hear a bell ringing, I know I'm just going to walk past the building.

784
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:56,850
Speaker 0: But even so, it's like that button should call the, you know, help.

785
00:39:57,532 --> 00:39:59,690
Speaker 1: Well, it does call help, but they didn't expect anyone to be.

786
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:04,115
Speaker 0: I mean, really, what they could do nowadays is the elevators have a cell phone and you push the button.

787
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:05,569
Speaker 0: It calls, you know, not on one.

788
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:12,130
Speaker 1: Anyway, for all the people who are saying he should have sued the place, the building settled for an undisclosed amount that he accepted.

789
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,509
Speaker 1: So I'm sure he was paid.

790
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,410
Speaker 1: Anyway, this video is pretty cool.

791
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:16,139
Speaker 1: What do you got?

792
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:16,830
Speaker 0: All right.

793
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:18,489
Speaker 0: So Will Eisner.

794
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,131
Speaker 0: Right.

795
00:40:19,191 --> 00:40:25,188
Speaker 0: We we've yet to talk about Will Eisner, mostly because the first Will Eisner book that we must read is at my grandma's house.

796
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,770
Speaker 0: Good to get it back to my grandma.

797
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:38,930
Speaker 0: There'll be plenty of Will Eisner action, which is it's kind of sad that it hasn't been Will Eisner action, seeing as he's the greatest comic creator to ever live with only Tezuka coming close with a tie or a second place.

798
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:39,552
Speaker 0: It's hard to tell.

799
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:44,753
Speaker 0: Anyway, Will Eisner, when he joined the military in the World War Two times.

800
00:40:44,914 --> 00:40:45,095
Speaker 0: Right.

801
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:47,310
Speaker 0: And he mostly did comics for the military.

802
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:59,969
Speaker 0: And afterwards, when he had his own comics company after leaving the military, talking, you know, from the early 50s to the 60s and such, he was still, you know, had the military was one of his clients.

803
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:03,550
Speaker 0: And he made a magazine called Preventative Maintenance Monthly.

804
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:11,490
Speaker 0: And here on this blog are many images and scans of Preventative Maintenance Monthly.

805
00:41:11,712 --> 00:41:13,670
Speaker 0: And it is quite awesome.

806
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:17,443
Speaker 0: And you can see the the epic comic power that is.

807
00:41:17,504 --> 00:41:29,529
Speaker 0: Will Eisner and his amazingness even doing, you know, a lame military comic telling you to change the oil in your Humvee or whatever and not let Greece get on rubber because it'll ruin it.

808
00:41:30,852 --> 00:41:34,329
Speaker 0: He still manages to make some of the greatest comics there ever were.

809
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:35,792
Speaker 0: All right.

810
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:36,375
Speaker 0: All right.

811
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:44,235
Speaker 1: So so anyway, before we get on to the main bid, Scott announced this contest intermittently for a while and then he kind of kept forgetting to mention it again.

812
00:41:44,256 --> 00:41:45,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have been lax.

813
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:54,529
Speaker 0: I think maybe that's why we get so few entries for contests and we're so unsuccessful with them is because despite, you know, saying we're going to do contests right, everyone else, you know, fucks them up.

814
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:55,770
Speaker 0: We never do them right.

815
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:58,190
Speaker 1: So well, you never do them right.

816
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,288
Speaker 1: I'm smart and just don't do them.

817
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,554
Speaker 0: Yeah.

818
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:04,854
Speaker 0: So I think the other thing is that so we either we either don't do them or do them poorly.

819
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,449
Speaker 1: I think it's more that we asked a lot.

820
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:10,070
Speaker 1: I mean, most of the entries we got patently didn't follow the rules.

821
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:10,680
Speaker 1: So screw them.

822
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:11,069
Speaker 0: Yep.

823
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,122
Speaker 0: Well, I have about.

824
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,130
Speaker 0: basically we had a contest.

825
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:22,350
Speaker 0: The contest was for the three volumes of the Goon Saga manga, which is a side story to the actual Goon Saga published by Vertical in English.

826
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:24,061
Speaker 0: It's the entire thing.

827
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:24,930
Speaker 0: It's only three volumes.

828
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:25,793
Speaker 0: We have all of them.

829
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:32,809
Speaker 0: And the contest was to write an essay saying why we should give them to you and, you know, to not screw up that essay.

830
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:36,432
Speaker 0: And basically, no matter how good your reasons were, if you screwed up the essay, we didn't count it.

831
00:42:37,295 --> 00:42:46,150
Speaker 0: And, you know, I didn't get that many submissions, but there were a handful of valid ones and I've been lazy, but I finally evaluated all of them.

832
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:50,740
Speaker 0: And the winner is Mr.

833
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:57,629
Speaker 0: Roboto, who is from Costa Rica, mostly because his essay was valid and he lives in Costa Rica.

834
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:05,610
Speaker 0: Therefore, it's probably best that someone in Costa Rica gets this manga because they probably can't buy it easily.

835
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:06,987
Speaker 0: And he also has a U.S.

836
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,133
Speaker 0: address, which is very nice because I can send it with normal shipping and then he'll get it somehow.

837
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:18,529
Speaker 0: I don't know how that works, but maybe I should get a Japan address and then I could buy Japanese video games and such and they would be sent to me.

838
00:43:19,455 --> 00:43:20,569
Speaker 0: I want to figure out how that works.

839
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:22,249
Speaker 0: I'm pretty interested now.

840
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,054
Speaker 0: But yeah, Mr.

841
00:43:24,094 --> 00:43:30,613
Speaker 0: Roboto, you should email me your address and then I will send you mangas for free.

842
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,688
Speaker 1: You should probably also follow up with him via email.

843
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:36,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

844
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:39,129
Speaker 0: I could do that, too, if he doesn't listen to the show.

845
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:49,329
Speaker 1: But anyway, on to actually reviewing some anime here on gig nights, Wednesdays, the quote unquote award winning anime podcast that doesn't talk about anime enough.

846
00:43:49,993 --> 00:43:50,215
Speaker 1: Yeah.

847
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:51,649
Speaker 1: Part of that's because Scott doesn't watch any.

848
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:52,948
Speaker 0: I've been reading books.

849
00:43:54,155 --> 00:43:56,490
Speaker 1: I didn't say anything other than that.

850
00:43:58,038 --> 00:43:59,989
Speaker 1: You don't watch so much anime, do you?

851
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:02,670
Speaker 0: It's video game and book season.

852
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:03,435
Speaker 0: Yeah.

853
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,150
Speaker 1: OK, so you don't watch so much anime.

854
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:05,832
Speaker 0: Not lately.

855
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:10,450
Speaker 0: Lately I've been watching more because it's starting a new anime season.

856
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:16,530
Speaker 1: But anyway, tonight we're going to talk about something pretty quickly because it's a fairly short kind of one off thing.

857
00:44:17,414 --> 00:44:20,070
Speaker 1: And I highly recommend it, but not for the reasons you might expect.

858
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:23,730
Speaker 1: We talk about Marius the Chojo.

859
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:24,411
Speaker 0: Right.

860
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:26,848
Speaker 0: Not show, Joe, but Joe Joe.

861
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,810
Speaker 1: It's kind of like if a show Joe means girl, Joe Joe means Supergirl.

862
00:44:31,191 --> 00:44:41,891
Speaker 1: This was actually released originally by CPM as the Supergirl or the Super Gal, and they were kind of sued because of Supergirl and were forced to rerelease it under a different name.

863
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:51,118
Speaker 0: But anyway, the deal is Rumiko Takahashi of Ranma slash Uruze Yatsura slash etcetera fame.

864
00:44:51,138 --> 00:44:51,790
Speaker 0: Right.

865
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:57,010
Speaker 0: She made a short story, a very short manga story about Marius the Jojo.

866
00:44:57,392 --> 00:44:57,653
Speaker 0: Right.

867
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:00,310
Speaker 0: And Emily said she read that manga and owns it.

868
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:01,770
Speaker 1: But it's like 10 pages long.

869
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,868
Speaker 1: It's like this happy little.

870
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:03,941
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's go.

871
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:04,327
Speaker 1: The end.

872
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:04,851
Speaker 0: Right.

873
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:06,830
Speaker 0: We haven't read it, though, but we know it exists.

874
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:10,910
Speaker 1: And she said, oh, that thing that's like this 10 page funny comic.

875
00:45:11,153 --> 00:45:11,822
Speaker 1: We should watch it.

876
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:12,390
Speaker 1: It'll be short.

877
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,384
Speaker 1: There's not much to it.

878
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,750
Speaker 0: Well, is it an OAV or a TV movie?

879
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:17,749
Speaker 1: It's OAV, I think.

880
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:18,172
Speaker 0: All right.

881
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:21,150
Speaker 0: So it's basically a one shot OAV, one episode.

882
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,970
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like a short movie.

883
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:24,509
Speaker 0: Was it like 40 minutes, something like that?

884
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,294
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

885
00:45:25,314 --> 00:45:26,240
Speaker 1: It was late and I didn't.

886
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:27,709
Speaker 1: I wasn't sure how long it was going to be.

887
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:28,969
Speaker 0: Wasn't as long as the movie.

888
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:35,770
Speaker 1: But I'll say this, much like a lot of other anime from that era of when I'm watching anime, it wasn't that long.

889
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:36,883
Speaker 1: It was, in fact, only 45 minutes.

890
00:45:37,931 --> 00:45:41,390
Speaker 1: But it felt interminable.

891
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,790
Speaker 1: It felt pretty long to steal a term from Dave and Joe.

892
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:50,130
Speaker 1: Kind of like how you watch Vampire Hunter D. And it's not that long, but it feels like it's super long.

893
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,470
Speaker 0: I think what it is, a lot of the scenes sort of drag.

894
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,790
Speaker 0: It's like there'll be a scene and there's not much plot.

895
00:45:56,891 --> 00:45:59,049
Speaker 0: I mean, they only had 10 pages of manga to go on.

896
00:45:59,310 --> 00:45:59,410
Speaker 0: Right.

897
00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:05,710
Speaker 0: But to fill up 45 minutes, like they would get to outer space and then they'd like a big scene.

898
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:06,846
Speaker 0: Like when they're in the desert.

899
00:46:06,927 --> 00:46:07,130
Speaker 0: Right.

900
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,009
Speaker 0: They're in the desert on some planet.

901
00:46:09,712 --> 00:46:12,510
Speaker 0: And it was just like a really 10 minutes of walking in the desert.

902
00:46:12,954 --> 00:46:14,170
Speaker 0: And I was like, come on.

903
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,182
Speaker 1: Except it was actually only like a minute or two, but it felt like.

904
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:19,230
Speaker 0: it felt like they were all going to the desert forever.

905
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:21,450
Speaker 0: And there's the beach scene, which is the scene.

906
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,015
Speaker 0: Awesome.

907
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:22,990
Speaker 0: It's just awesome.

908
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:23,754
Speaker 0: You're awesome.

909
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,530
Speaker 0: It felt like it was five minutes long.

910
00:46:25,631 --> 00:46:27,469
Speaker 0: Just watching crazy shit on the beach.

911
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:38,329
Speaker 1: But first, this was actually directed by, of all people, Kazuyoshi Katayama, who, among other things, went on to direct the Big O. Big O. It's Showtime.

912
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:39,310
Speaker 0: Awesome.

913
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,050
Speaker 1: And he was actually I didn't realize this.

914
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,269
Speaker 1: He was the assistant director for Nausicaa Valley of the Wind.

915
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,070
Speaker 0: All right.

916
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,087
Speaker 1: And a bunch of other stuff.

917
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,548
Speaker 0: But it's a pretty important anime person that not many people have heard of.

918
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,878
Speaker 1: Maurice the Chojo is about.

919
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:56,210
Speaker 1: it's about a girl who's from a planet that was blowed up.

920
00:46:56,871 --> 00:47:01,670
Speaker 1: And everyone on that planet has seven times the strength of a normal human.

921
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:05,690
Speaker 0: I imagine it's probably one of those things where the planet had seven times the gravity.

922
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,168
Speaker 0: So everyone is super strong there.

923
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,130
Speaker 1: I don't know if it would even be addressed.

924
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:18,870
Speaker 0: The thing is, she's super strong in outer space also, which, yeah, it was not one of those things where they explain it, where, you know, a science fiction nerd would be satisfied.

925
00:47:19,091 --> 00:47:24,670
Speaker 1: But because she's super strong, she wears these restraints most of the time, because otherwise she busts stuff up and gets in trouble.

926
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:31,690
Speaker 0: Like if she just walks around without restraints, like she'll just her step will smash the floor, which is not too good in a spaceship.

927
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,669
Speaker 0: It could mean a certain doom.

928
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,330
Speaker 1: So what problems does she face?

929
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,010
Speaker 1: Well, one, she's poor and that's pretty much it.

930
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:40,909
Speaker 0: That's pretty much.

931
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,210
Speaker 1: And she wants to not be poor anymore.

932
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,590
Speaker 0: That's pretty much typical anime fare.

933
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,790
Speaker 0: I mean, in outer space, no money.

934
00:47:47,911 --> 00:47:49,170
Speaker 0: Can we bebop anyone?

935
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,749
Speaker 0: I mean, how many times have we seen this?

936
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:59,110
Speaker 1: Now she has her kind of copilot and friend is this little kitsune who is hilarious.

937
00:47:59,290 --> 00:47:59,989
Speaker 0: He's pretty funny.

938
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:02,482
Speaker 1: And the plot is basically she's.

939
00:48:02,522 --> 00:48:03,890
Speaker 0: I don't know why he hangs out with her, though.

940
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:04,433
Speaker 0: He should.

941
00:48:04,454 --> 00:48:06,190
Speaker 1: But he comes out constantly complains.

942
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,288
Speaker 1: Why do I hang out with you?

943
00:48:07,774 --> 00:48:08,665
Speaker 1: But he doesn't go away now.

944
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:14,690
Speaker 1: But the plot is that it starts out and there's this kind of action scene where she beats up a bunch of people.

945
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:18,970
Speaker 1: And I was worried about what kind of show this was because she beats up everyone.

946
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:25,489
Speaker 1: But there's one guy who's wearing like a power suit and he's like, oh, like, I'm awesome and I will defeat you.

947
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,283
Speaker 1: But then we put Scott's like, is that?

948
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:30,810
Speaker 1: did he pee himself?

949
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:31,741
Speaker 1: No, it can't be.

950
00:48:31,782 --> 00:48:32,310
Speaker 1: And we're watching.

951
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,609
Speaker 1: It's like, no, that's just like some waters.

952
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:35,273
Speaker 0: I can't.

953
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:36,549
Speaker 0: I completely forgot about this.

954
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:41,630
Speaker 1: And then it cuts to her and she's like, wow, he's so afraid.

955
00:48:41,971 --> 00:48:44,069
Speaker 1: He's so afraid, despite all appearances.

956
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,066
Speaker 1: And we're like, was that actually intended to be P?

957
00:48:47,086 --> 00:48:47,770
Speaker 1: to convey that?

958
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:58,590
Speaker 1: And not only is that indeed P, not only did he pee all over himself, but the P is there like in inordinate amount.

959
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,310
Speaker 1: Like you see it so much in every like it's highlighted.

960
00:49:02,512 --> 00:49:03,137
Speaker 1: It's there.

961
00:49:03,158 --> 00:49:04,530
Speaker 1: The guy peed himself.

962
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,290
Speaker 0: This is this is pretty much a wacky show.

963
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:11,910
Speaker 0: It's just as very simple, sort of dragon half cut.

964
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:15,550
Speaker 0: If you want to drag and have only a little crazy, you want an analogous show.

965
00:49:15,934 --> 00:49:16,989
Speaker 1: It is Project Aco.

966
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,110
Speaker 0: Project Aco is also very analogous.

967
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:26,650
Speaker 1: The deal is eventually she gets a job to save some guy who was kidnapped and the guy is super pretty.

968
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:30,410
Speaker 1: So she decides any super sounds like dragon have to be all right.

969
00:49:30,772 --> 00:49:32,468
Speaker 1: I'll save him and then he'll marry me.

970
00:49:33,212 --> 00:49:36,070
Speaker 1: And I don't care what he's like because I'll be I won't be poor anymore.

971
00:49:36,811 --> 00:49:40,670
Speaker 0: And plus, she's got a family who has the same problem she does, that they're super strong.

972
00:49:40,992 --> 00:49:44,350
Speaker 0: But her dad's drunk and her mom's stupid, I guess.

973
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,550
Speaker 1: And she goes to save him.

974
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:49,150
Speaker 1: But it turns out that he's being protected by this evil guy who's just char.

975
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:55,450
Speaker 1: And then this other girl who's basically Biko and she is three times the strength of a normal human.

976
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:59,609
Speaker 1: But it turns out they were both wrestlers and it just goes crazy from there.

977
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:06,450
Speaker 1: And what this really is, is a vehicle for a million cameos and side jokes.

978
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:07,550
Speaker 0: The beach scene.

979
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:13,030
Speaker 0: It's never more evident than in the beach scene and in the the the the cantina scene.

980
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:15,088
Speaker 1: Basically, yeah, the Darth, the Mos Eisley.

981
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,309
Speaker 1: So basically, Darth Vader's huff and paint.

982
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:17,752
Speaker 0: All right.

983
00:50:17,773 --> 00:50:19,609
Speaker 0: So first, I'll discuss the beach scene.

984
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:25,250
Speaker 0: They there's one part in which they they taxi someone to the beach as a ploy to get money.

985
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:29,629
Speaker 1: So say it, Emily, this is like one page and that's it.

986
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:36,490
Speaker 1: But instead, they drag it out into this almost music video montage of all these scenes of the beach.

987
00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:37,910
Speaker 1: And it's actually really funny.

988
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:41,970
Speaker 0: Yes, it's basically, you know, they get to the beach and then they just this camera.

989
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:46,230
Speaker 0: They show you all these just scenes happening on the beach while this music plays.

990
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:51,830
Speaker 0: And you see such things as other Rumiko Takahashi characters hanging out on the beach, under the water, et cetera.

991
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:54,910
Speaker 1: All of them, like you see Ten and Lum and Ataru and all these people.

992
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,552
Speaker 0: Right.

993
00:50:55,572 --> 00:50:59,310
Speaker 0: You see a battleship under the sea shooting.

994
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:09,190
Speaker 1: You see, there is a strange undertone where it's obvious like you watch this and it's like, wow, this giant war is just starting.

995
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,690
Speaker 0: You see an alien invasion of mechanical space alligators.

996
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:20,330
Speaker 1: The Dinobots are marching out of the ocean and right next to them, everyone's just hanging out on the beach, totally ignoring them.

997
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:27,890
Speaker 0: It's really weird because this giant like it's like there's an alien invasion of bat of old and new battleships in space and undersea.

998
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:32,210
Speaker 0: And, you know, cyborgs and robots and aliens and God knows what.

999
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,570
Speaker 0: But all the people on the beach are hanging out.

1000
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:44,710
Speaker 0: It's like if you took an anime about a horrible alien invasion and took an anime about hanging out on the beach, being happy, and you just put the cells one on top of the other and didn't.

1001
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:47,590
Speaker 0: And the two things, the two worlds didn't actually collide.

1002
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,410
Speaker 1: The best part is the guy who's scuba diving.

1003
00:51:50,714 --> 00:51:51,329
Speaker 0: No, definitely.

1004
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:55,330
Speaker 1: Because he kind of there's this big blue thing and spoilers, I guess.

1005
00:51:55,691 --> 00:52:01,270
Speaker 1: And he's like, he's swimming toward it and he kind of pokes his head in the hole, is looking around and suddenly clamps around him and it eats him.

1006
00:52:01,471 --> 00:52:03,890
Speaker 1: Well, it's like it clamps around him and you wait.

1007
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:04,915
Speaker 1: And I'm like, ha ha.

1008
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:07,650
Speaker 1: And then it goes like, oh, now he's totally inside.

1009
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:10,210
Speaker 0: So he just got eaten by a creature on the bottom of this.

1010
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,510
Speaker 1: Now, that's funny in and of itself.

1011
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:17,550
Speaker 1: But then a second later, like with perfect comedic timing, his bones pop out, it burps and these bones pop out.

1012
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:18,550
Speaker 1: And it's just hilarious.

1013
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:23,610
Speaker 0: Not only is it funny that the bones pop out with comedic timing and a little burping noise.

1014
00:52:24,232 --> 00:52:28,530
Speaker 0: The actual the way the bones are drawn is really funny.

1015
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,869
Speaker 0: I like bones, but they're really cute.

1016
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:36,167
Speaker 1: There's a similarly long scene with the desert, but I guess what I would say about the desert.

1017
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:44,270
Speaker 0: So at one point they crash on the desert and it's the girl and the and Maurice and the fox walking around the desert.

1018
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:49,870
Speaker 1: By the way, while it kind of works, the kitchen is a total jackass asshole.

1019
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:50,392
Speaker 0: Yes.

1020
00:52:50,874 --> 00:52:55,410
Speaker 0: So in that one, two characters crash spaceship walking around the desert.

1021
00:52:55,531 --> 00:52:57,070
Speaker 0: And I'm like, Star Wars.

1022
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,649
Speaker 0: I even said Star Wars out loud.

1023
00:52:59,071 --> 00:52:59,372
Speaker 0: Right.

1024
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:04,190
Speaker 0: While we were watching it, they arrive at sort of a shady ghost town.

1025
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:06,730
Speaker 0: I'm like, most easily I say it out loud.

1026
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,850
Speaker 1: And then we immediately see Darth Vader huffing paint.

1027
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:12,870
Speaker 0: There's Darth Vader huffing paint and there's an R2D2 in the background.

1028
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:14,649
Speaker 0: And I'm like, I fucking called it.

1029
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:16,367
Speaker 0: How more obvious could they be?

1030
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:20,721
Speaker 1: But if I was going to say anything about this show, it wouldn't.

1031
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:23,810
Speaker 1: it's not necessarily a great show in and of itself.

1032
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,968
Speaker 1: No, not really what it is.

1033
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:37,690
Speaker 1: And it really gave me the same vibe I got when I was in fourth grade, when I was like eight or nine years old and I was seeing my first anime and I would watch any anime I could get and shows from that era.

1034
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:53,270
Speaker 1: Like shows like that where there's these long kind of dragged out musical number scenes and there's this goonie kind of humor that that the style of goonie humor in modern anime is a lot different from the style of goonie humor from this older anime.

1035
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:59,950
Speaker 1: And I don't know, this is the best show to show to a whole bunch of people at once.

1036
00:54:00,512 --> 00:54:03,650
Speaker 0: As the best show to hold a bunch of people in that genre.

1037
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,150
Speaker 0: It's a great show to show to a whole bunch of people.

1038
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:08,570
Speaker 1: I think it's up there with Elf Princess Rain.

1039
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,450
Speaker 0: It is definitely right up there with Elf Princess Rain.

1040
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:21,970
Speaker 0: It's just Dragon Half, Echo, all those sort of wacky sort of semi one shot adventure thingies to have a fun time with.

1041
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:31,450
Speaker 1: But these are wacky in the older school way as opposed to like Excel Saga and all those kinds of things which are wacky in this kind of completely different way.

1042
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,870
Speaker 1: Not saying one is better or worse, but it's a different kind of wacky.

1043
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:38,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the old school wacky and I liked it, but I don't know if I'd watch it again.

1044
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:50,310
Speaker 1: But the real vibe I got and Emily got the same vibe and Scott even did to a degree was watch this show if you're in the same frame of mind to watch like Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

1045
00:54:51,111 --> 00:54:58,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely the late night quiet kind of weird action enhances it in a different way than the large crowd does.

1046
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,270
Speaker 1: Yes, but I think both are good.

1047
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:05,390
Speaker 1: I mean, if you run an anime club show this, it'll go over really well.

1048
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:11,110
Speaker 0: I got people yelling and screaming and oh my God, they can get over the fact that it looks old, which I never actually heard any.

1049
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:16,050
Speaker 0: You know, I hear old school anime fans complain, hey, kids don't look at stuff because it looks old.

1050
00:55:16,652 --> 00:55:20,390
Speaker 0: And I've never actually heard anyone say I'm not watching this because it looks old.

1051
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,830
Speaker 1: The only people I've ever heard say something like that were people who aren't anime fans.

1052
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,770
Speaker 1: They're Naruto only fans or they're Bleach only fans.

1053
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,110
Speaker 1: People who are like just getting into anime, they've only seen like the Dragon Ball.

1054
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:31,786
Speaker 1: That's all they like.

1055
00:55:32,631 --> 00:55:35,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyone who watches anime, no, I've never heard Dragon Ball looks old.

1056
00:55:36,311 --> 00:55:37,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dragon Ball does look old now.

1057
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't realize how old it looked till I saw some the other day.

1058
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,530
Speaker 0: It's also really poorly drawn that Mario's the Jojo is better looking than Dragon Ball.

1059
00:55:45,311 --> 00:55:46,229
Speaker 1: Mario's the Jojo.

1060
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:53,730
Speaker 1: If you have an anime club, show it and talk it up as this old school event and people will yell and scream and they'll stop.

1061
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,370
Speaker 1: They'll be kind of bored during the desert scene.

1062
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:56,427
Speaker 1: They'll be like, what's going on?

1063
00:55:56,815 --> 00:55:57,550
Speaker 1: Where is this going?

1064
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,330
Speaker 0: And the desert scene, it actually starts to get serious for a little bit.

1065
00:56:01,871 --> 00:56:05,470
Speaker 0: And like a few times it sort of tries to be serious, kind of.

1066
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:10,210
Speaker 1: But it does it in that old school like Slayers where it's like, we're going to be serious.

1067
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:10,850
Speaker 0: Just kidding.

1068
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:14,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, but all that desert scene is, is just set up.

1069
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:27,643
Speaker 1: If you have a crowd for when they see Darth Vader, even if it's not that funny in and of itself, if you've got a crowd of anime fans in a room having been set up with this desert scene and suddenly they see Darth Vader, they're going to go,

1070
00:56:27,806 --> 00:56:27,908
Speaker 0: ah!

1071
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:29,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

1072
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:30,689
Speaker 0: All right.

1073
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:34,410
Speaker 0: That was a little bit of a long show, but I guess it makes up for no show yesterday, right?

1074
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:34,823
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1075
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,590
Speaker 1: And we'll probably do a show tomorrow.

1076
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:43,490
Speaker 1: There's a tiny chance we might do a special or something quick because I'm actually going to Rochester for Toricon, which might be the last.

1077
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,470
Speaker 0: Aren't you going Friday?

1078
00:56:45,271 --> 00:56:47,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I got to pack and get ready Thursday and sleep.

1079
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,110
Speaker 0: I'm going to have a new computer tomorrow.

1080
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:49,541
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1081
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:56,470
Speaker 1: So basically what I had to put together and what I'm trying to warn all of you is that I might want to go to bed early and hang out.

1082
00:56:57,052 --> 00:57:04,930
Speaker 1: And much like when I got my new computer and suddenly there were a couple of non-geek nights because, oh, Rims got to do something.

1083
00:57:05,573 --> 00:57:08,430
Speaker 1: Maybe I think Scott's feeling the desire to build his computer.

1084
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,930
Speaker 0: Maybe we could do something like special.

1085
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:13,050
Speaker 0: I'm thinking maybe.

1086
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,090
Speaker 1: I think we should do a special.

1087
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,749
Speaker 1: The Thursday specials are always fun.

1088
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,130
Speaker 1: People seem to enjoy them almost more so than a normal Thursday.

1089
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,010
Speaker 0: I'm kind of thinking, right?

1090
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,230
Speaker 0: This might be spur of the moment.

1091
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,745
Speaker 0: I don't know if we want to say it on the show, right?

1092
00:57:22,692 --> 00:57:30,789
Speaker 0: I don't know if you haven't discussed this with you beforehand, but maybe we could do something crazy like we Skype a listener and talk for 15 minutes and that's it.

1093
00:57:31,635 --> 00:57:32,470
Speaker 1: That might be interesting.

1094
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:33,409
Speaker 1: Depends on the listener.

1095
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,645
Speaker 1: I know I kind of want to listen to that.

1096
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,507
Speaker 0: I know we're like, sure, Betts.

1097
00:57:37,831 --> 00:57:39,648
Speaker 1: I kind of want to Skype like Daryl Surratt.

1098
00:57:40,552 --> 00:57:44,310
Speaker 1: I mean, like, hey, Daryl, let's talk about something that isn't anime or video games.

1099
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:47,388
Speaker 0: Well, you could do like a 15 minute geek profile or, you know, something like that.

1100
00:57:48,351 --> 00:57:52,650
Speaker 0: So I guess people are probably going to comment on that saying, pick me, pick me in the forums, right?

1101
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:54,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure they will.

1102
00:57:54,531 --> 00:57:55,077
Speaker 0: I'm sure they will.

1103
00:57:55,603 --> 00:57:56,270
Speaker 0: Well, maybe we'll do it.

1104
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:56,679
Speaker 0: Maybe not.

1105
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:56,988
Speaker 0: We'll see.

1106
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,168
Speaker 1: But anyway, the New York Comic Con was OK.

1107
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:07,690
Speaker 0: TM Revolution was the fucking bomb and hopefully explosive, hopefully a very small bomb with a very large explosion.

1108
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:08,950
Speaker 1: He's like a neutron bomb.

1109
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,250
Speaker 0: He's really small.

1110
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:11,189
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

1111
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,650
Speaker 0: He's so energetic, so small.

1112
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:21,930
Speaker 1: Normally with someone who's famous, you expect at some point that grin to turn into the slightly forced grin.

1113
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:27,590
Speaker 1: I mean, as like game face as I am at conventions, because people see me at cons.

1114
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:34,790
Speaker 1: I'm up there like, yeah, and then I get to the room and it's like my face goes from the smile to like the frown before I fall asleep and snore and like die.

1115
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:43,290
Speaker 1: But every now and then my visage cracks and visage and famous people, it cracks because they have even more pressure.

1116
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:45,730
Speaker 1: But I didn't see a single crack in this guy.

1117
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:49,450
Speaker 1: Maybe he might be a robot, a very small robot.

1118
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,049
Speaker 1: He might be a robot.

1119
00:58:51,557 --> 00:58:52,370
Speaker 0: He's a very small robot.

1120
00:58:54,212 --> 00:58:55,970
Speaker 0: During the show, the show's got to be over now.

1121
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:56,929
Speaker 0: It's done.

1122
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:57,530
Speaker 0: It's done.

1123
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,160
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
