1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,198
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, December 22nd, 2015.

2
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:10,619
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:14,588
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,400
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights!

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,010
Speaker 0: Tonight, Towerfall!

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,078
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:41,620
Speaker 0: So last night I was playing some Counter-Strike, and I kind of wanted to play casually, so very often if I'm just playing like, you know, play for an hour after we do a Geek Nights or something, I'll just play Demolition mode, because it's basically like a hyper-focused version of regular Counter-Strike on half-sized maps.

8
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:51,940
Speaker 0: So it's more about, like, it's the same sort of strategy, it's just a much sort of smaller, tighter experience, and you don't have the weapon buying, you have the sort of gun game reverse progression instead.

9
00:00:53,421 --> 00:01:02,539
Speaker 0: It's probably a better pubby casual experience than actual, like, classic casual is, just because, you know, the kinds of players and the shortness.

10
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:25,300
Speaker 0: But anyway, I was playing the other night, I found a really good group of people, like, you got a set of people, so ten people who are all, like, pretty into the game, good voice chat, banner going, the team's pretty even, mixing it up, but then we were playing on that lake house map, and for whatever reason, the team that was playing as the counter-terrorists just sucked.

11
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,500
Speaker 0: Like, they were playing really, really badly in the first half.

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Speaker 0: Or, sorry, the terrorists, but anyway, they were playing super badly.

13
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,016
Speaker 1: So the team you weren't on...

14
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, the team I was not on was so bad.

15
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:37,692
Speaker 1: Even worse than you and me.

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,442
Speaker 0: I'm okay.

17
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:45,818
Speaker 0: I'm probably, like, two full skill bands above you, but, like, four skill bands below Andrew.

18
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,779
Speaker 0: So, playing the game, we're crushing them, and it's not like, "Oh, they don't know how to

19
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:53,040
Speaker 0: shoot.".

20
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,880
Speaker 0: It's just they're being really overly cautious about getting into the house.

21
00:01:58,461 --> 00:02:08,158
Speaker 0: So, as a result, we were in the house holding it every time, and they couldn't get into the house, and they were just, like, they would lose every round, even if it was closed, because of that.

22
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:10,860
Speaker 0: So they kept getting more and more cautious.

23
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,917
Speaker 0: So, at the end of one round, one of my teammates is like, "Yeah, why don't we just let them win

24
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:16,138
Speaker 0: one?".

25
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:23,277
Speaker 0: So then the next round starts, and I'm like, "Actually, guys, let's just hide and see what they

26
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:23,558
Speaker 0: do.".

27
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:27,860
Speaker 0: So we hid behind rocks way back behind our spawn.

28
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:35,860
Speaker 0: We fired a few, like, desultory shots at the house to, like, knock out some windows and things, and then we just hid, and didn't move, didn't even look at the house, and didn't do anything.

29
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,213
Speaker 0: And we just waited, and it was the over-under on, "Are they going to plant the bomb?

30
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:42,100
Speaker 0: Are they afraid we're in the house?

31
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:43,612
Speaker 0: What's going

32
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:43,898
Speaker 0: on?".

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,379
Speaker 1: What were you going to do if they did plant the bomb?

34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,459
Speaker 0: Fucking charge in and see what happens.

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,820
Speaker 0: But it would have taken us a while to get there.

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,889
Speaker 1: I was going to say, you're far away from the house.

37
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:53,457
Speaker 1: If they plant, you'll probably run in and go,

38
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:53,779
Speaker 1: "Boom!".

39
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:58,600
Speaker 0: If that had happened, it would have been seven and two, so I think we would have been okay.

40
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:09,060
Speaker 0: So, sure enough, we kind of see them, like, surrounding the house from all the different angles, and very cautiously and slowly approaching it as the timer runs down.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:21,160
Speaker 0: And then, finally, with 30 seconds to go, one of them, like, crouch-walks very slowly up the outside of the house, sneaks in a window, goes down to plant, and I deagled him with a headshot.

42
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:23,760
Speaker 0: And I was very proud.

43
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,599
Speaker 1: So you were just watching that entrance from real far away?

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,868
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were all laughing about it.

45
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:28,639
Speaker 0: Everyone was, like, fighting over who got to kill him.

46
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:32,080
Speaker 0: So, that was my Counter-Strike the other night.

47
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:33,456
Speaker 1: Okay.

48
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, got any gaming news?

49
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,092
Speaker 1: No, because I haven't really played any games lately.

50
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:39,660
Speaker 1: There's no multiplayer games left to play.

51
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,568
Speaker 0: Counter-Strike?

52
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:41,277
Speaker 0: Rocket League?

53
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,204
Speaker 0: No.

54
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:44,020
Speaker 1: Can't play Rocket League with a bad matchmaking.

55
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:46,168
Speaker 0: I've had little trouble.

56
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:47,715
Speaker 0: Besides, Phil and Chie are playing.

57
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:48,680
Speaker 0: We've got friends who are playing.

58
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:56,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played with them, and it was, you know, I'm not very good at Rocket League, but I was better than all of them at Rocket League.

59
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:58,300
Speaker 0: So, we need, like, both of us need to play.

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,368
Speaker 1: Or they could level up.

61
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,580
Speaker 1: If they leveled up, it would be good.

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,740
Speaker 0: We just need to get six friends who, there are at least two teams of roughly equivalent skill between the six people.

63
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,819
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not playing, so my skill is staying still, so you guys can all catch up to me, right?

64
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,620
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, I'm not getting any better.

65
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:20,180
Speaker 0: So, in the news, the Ghostbusters game, the tabletop board game.

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,464
Speaker 1: Which one?

67
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:21,159
Speaker 1: There's so many of them.

68
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:28,060
Speaker 0: The tabletop board game that was Kickstarted a while ago that I made disparaging comments about before I'd read the rules.

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:40,899
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I know nothing about it, other than that someone's Kickstarting a Ghostbusters board game, but that would give me a bad sign, because A, it's Kickstarted, and B, it's a licensed property on a board game, which is usually a sign that it's going to be a bad

70
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:41,080
Speaker 0: game.

71
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,359
Speaker 0: Oh, also, C, Cryptozoic.

72
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:43,720
Speaker 1: Oh, man, that's the worst.

73
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:51,412
Speaker 0: So, it was like the triad of, I assume this game is going to be bad, and I disparaged it as such, but the Kickstarter raised 1.5 million dollars.

74
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, board games are huge, board games are expensive.

75
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,298
Speaker 0: Ghostbusters is huge.

76
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:06,180
Speaker 1: Ghostbusters is huge, so, I mean, you could just make, you know, a game where you open up the box, and it's just a bunch of Ghostbusters toys and some D6s, and people will pay for that, right?

77
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,547
Speaker 0: And that's basically what the game is.

78
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:09,920
Speaker 0: It's a bunch of Ghostbusters toys and dice.

79
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:10,939
Speaker 1: Okay.

80
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,622
Speaker 0: That's the game.

81
00:05:12,023 --> 00:05:16,860
Speaker 0: So, I've read, I've not played this game, and I will not play this game.

82
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:19,889
Speaker 0: The game is bad, but I should qualify that.

83
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:22,840
Speaker 0: It is bad at being a game for people over the age of about ten.

84
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,059
Speaker 1: They decided-- Well, what are the ages advertised on the box?

85
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:27,099
Speaker 0: Fifteen plus.

86
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:27,800
Speaker 1: Alright.

87
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:31,960
Speaker 0: I would say this game, honestly, like, I'm not joking or trying to make fun of them.

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,340
Speaker 0: This is a six to ten year old person game.

89
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:34,820
Speaker 1: Alright.

90
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,320
Speaker 0: It is, imagine, so remember Necromunda, like those games?

91
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,740
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean Mutant Chronicles?

92
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, all that kind of game.

93
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,540
Speaker 0: All those games like that.

94
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,540
Speaker 1: You mean like, HeroQuest and Descent?

95
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:51,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, so imagine those kinds of games-- And the D&D ones where it's just like a dungeon in a box?

96
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,260
Speaker 0: Where the rules are a full order of magnitude simpler.

97
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:58,520
Speaker 0: There's really no equipment upgrades or anything.

98
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:12,020
Speaker 0: The combat is simplified to, like, single die rolls, and the maps that are arranged and the scenarios you do are so generic that they literally might as well apply to any potential situation.

99
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:15,300
Speaker 0: There is nothing related to Ghostbusters in the game mechanics.

100
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:17,240
Speaker 1: I mean-- You mean this game?

101
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:17,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, this game.

102
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,800
Speaker 0: It's basically this game.

103
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,299
Speaker 1: No, this one.

104
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,840
Speaker 1: In the picture.

105
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,260
Speaker 0: Yeah.

106
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:43,280
Speaker 0: So imagine, like, the way the gameplay seems to go is, co-op and wander your Ghostbusters around these tiles that make all these basically identical maps, and you've got to, like, get a ghost with your proton pack, and then maybe you want multiple people to have gotten that same ghost, and then you roll some dice and put them in a trap, and then put them in containment.

107
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:51,580
Speaker 0: But periodically, ghosts are coming out of containment into the real world, and there's really nothing else going on.

108
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,935
Speaker 0: You kind of generically level up.

109
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:03,840
Speaker 0: The characters are all from the Ghostbusters movie, and they all have these super fucking generic, like, not even related to the theme at all, sort of unique powers that are meaningless.

110
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:07,080
Speaker 0: And there's nothing to this game.

111
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,700
Speaker 0: Like, I read the rules five or six times, and I cannot imagine there being anything to this game.

112
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,299
Speaker 0: Like, there's nothing to do.

113
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,240
Speaker 0: I can't imagine it being amusing.

114
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,398
Speaker 0: And they talk about how customizable it is.

115
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,680
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, people play HeroQuest, and they don't realize it's broken.

116
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,640
Speaker 0: Because they're dumb.

117
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,440
Speaker 0: But imagine HeroQuest, but literally a hundred times simpler.

118
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,920
Speaker 1: How could it be simpler than HeroQuest?

119
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:42,200
Speaker 1: I mean, if you go less than HeroQuest, you're like in zombies territory, but at least in zombies, you overcome the lack of depth in the, you know, the small things by having quantity, right?

120
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,920
Speaker 0: No, you overcome the lack of depth in zombies, because zombies is a cheap game.

121
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,560
Speaker 0: The Ghostbusters game is eighty fucking five dollars.

122
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,475
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

123
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Speaker 1: You could get Eclipse.

124
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,358
Speaker 1: You could get XCOM for less than this.

125
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,047
Speaker 0: Yeah.

126
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:56,204
Speaker 0: So...

127
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:57,840
Speaker 1: How are you paying eighty five dollars?

128
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,939
Speaker 1: What the hell is in there?

129
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,059
Speaker 1: Like, gold plated?

130
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:06,620
Speaker 0: A big Stay Puft Marshmallow Man who has basically generic mechanics, just like every other generic ghost in this generic skin game.

131
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,139
Speaker 1: But I mean, is he like, is that Stay Puft Marshmallow Man like a high quality kid robot toy that would be like twenty, thirty bucks on its own?

132
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:20,820
Speaker 0: No, it's, they're kind of, they're like a step above HeroQuest, but they're not really paintable, because they're like, it's hard to describe.

133
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:22,480
Speaker 1: And people can paint anything.

134
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're kind of too smooth.

135
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,599
Speaker 1: Sand it, prime it.

136
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,739
Speaker 0: And they don't have the kinds of like grooves and ridges that I would need to paint something like this.

137
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,197
Speaker 1: Sand it and prime it.

138
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:37,719
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying like, it would be hard to paint the detail in because the details in the lines are not deep enough.

139
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:41,179
Speaker 1: I mean, pros, that doesn't stop people who are good at painting.

140
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just don't think- But I mean, they need to be painted.

141
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,760
Speaker 1: They're not, they're just a solid single color?

142
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,119
Speaker 0: They're all solid single colors.

143
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:46,876
Speaker 0: Okay.

144
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,360
Speaker 0: But like, I don't even want to, the gameplay is just nothing.

145
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,879
Speaker 0: Like, it's pretty much co-op guillotine, is the level I'd put it at.

146
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
Speaker 1: But guillotine isn't anything like HeroQuest.

147
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,359
Speaker 0: In terms of the amount of thinking you have to do.

148
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:00,380
Speaker 1: Oh, which is none?

149
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:02,259
Speaker 0: Almost none.

150
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:06,620
Speaker 0: You could play guillotine badly, if you really wanted to.

151
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,360
Speaker 0: Okay.

152
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,900
Speaker 0: But the problems, it comes down to, it doesn't even fit the theme of Ghostbusters very well.

153
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:18,800
Speaker 0: Use your proton packs to get the ghosts, but you can't cross the streams.

154
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,959
Speaker 0: Nothing like that happens.

155
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,440
Speaker 0: None of the things- Not even accidentally?

156
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,020
Speaker 0: No, that's not a mechanic somehow.

157
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,060
Speaker 1: You don't have to bargain with Gozer or Zool?

158
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:25,124
Speaker 0: No.

159
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:25,645
Speaker 1: No?

160
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,120
Speaker 1: You don't have to insult the mayor?

161
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,199
Speaker 0: You make scenarios, and I already read- Can you get slimed even?

162
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:33,840
Speaker 0: Yes, you can get slimed.

163
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,739
Speaker 0: You can't die, so you can just get slimed.

164
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:37,759
Speaker 1: Can you collect things and research them?

165
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,077
Speaker 0: No, nothing like that.

166
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:41,180
Speaker 1: Can you drive around?

167
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,259
Speaker 0: Yes, you can drive Ecto-1 around.

168
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,799
Speaker 0: Imagine the fire truck- In Flashpoint?

169
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:48,640
Speaker 0: In Flashpoint.

170
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,019
Speaker 1: Where you just drive it around the side of the house?

171
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:55,140
Speaker 0: But it doesn't really do much, and it's kind of a pain in the ass to use.

172
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:58,860
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a pain in the ass to use the fire truck in Flashpoint, but it does a lot.

173
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, Flashpoint is bullshit because the dog can't drive the fire truck, but that's totally separate.

174
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:09,740
Speaker 1: Why didn't they make this Ghostbusters game where you drive around town instead of one where it's focusing on one building?

175
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:16,399
Speaker 0: I was reading some things about the game design and everything, and apparently I found this tidbit- Who designed this game?

176
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:19,018
Speaker 0: I looked up the names of the people- What else have they made?

177
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:28,520
Speaker 0: The game appears, based on a bunch of other people's research, to be just a reskin of this other game called Zombicide.

178
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:31,039
Speaker 1: Okay, I never heard or played of that.

179
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:33,290
Speaker 0: Which looks like it was also a Kickstarter.

180
00:10:33,351 --> 00:10:35,300
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not the kind of game we would play.

181
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:39,820
Speaker 0: But what's interesting about this game is not that it's bad.

182
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:44,020
Speaker 0: It's not good enough to even bother reviewing all the reasons it's bad in detail.

183
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:46,620
Speaker 0: You can figure that out just by reading the rules.

184
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,020
Speaker 0: But the reviews of this game have been surprisingly glowing, even on places that should know better.

185
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:03,940
Speaker 0: I read a lot of reviews of this game, and what I want to point out is that almost all of them rated the game pretty highly if they had a number or a metric.

186
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:13,640
Speaker 0: And talked a lot about how it's great and it's Ghostbusters, but when they actually describe their experiences, they all but say that the game's boring.

187
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,880
Speaker 0: But they avoid actually saying out loud directly that it's boring.

188
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:20,800
Speaker 1: This is what all the reviews are doing lately for things like Fallout.

189
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:26,400
Speaker 1: In the written review, they can just write whatever they want because people don't read, and even if they do read, they have no reading comprehension.

190
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,853
Speaker 1: And then they put a big ol' number at the end because, whatever.

191
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:31,400
Speaker 1: Metacritic, whatever.

192
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:40,100
Speaker 0: But if this is what $1.5 million gets you, what could they possibly have spent that money on except the production values of the pieces?

193
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,846
Speaker 1: I hope that they were intelligent.

194
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:45,920
Speaker 1: I can respect them if they spent it on awesome vacations in houses and cars.

195
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,013
Speaker 1: And they made this game for nothing and are like, "Lol, we're riding you dumbasses.

196
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,039
Speaker 1: We'll buy anything that says Ghostbusters on

197
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,140
Speaker 1: it.".

198
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,867
Speaker 1: I mean, the thing is, it is a fine little kid game.

199
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,791
Speaker 0: It is probably great at that.

200
00:11:57,811 --> 00:11:58,192
Speaker 0: You know what?

201
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:02,060
Speaker 0: It's a better game for six-year-olds than Monopoly, by far.

202
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,080
Speaker 1: Is it better than HeroQuest?

203
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,700
Speaker 0: HeroQuest is twice the game this is, even with every flaw we know about in HeroQuest.

204
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,199
Speaker 1: HeroQuest is so broken.

205
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:21,800
Speaker 0: It is, but at least in HeroQuest, if you make your own scenarios using the rules, there's something different about those scenarios.

206
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:32,000
Speaker 0: Other than just completely making up brand new rules, I cannot come up with any way to make a scenario in this game that is materially different from any other scenario other than the proper nouns.

207
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,140
Speaker 1: Well, is the map in this Ghostbusters game a grid?

208
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:35,380
Speaker 0: It's a grid.

209
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,399
Speaker 1: And how big are the pieces?

210
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,960
Speaker 0: So, it's nine squares on a grid, and you use a bunch of those squares to make the map.

211
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,142
Speaker 1: Okay, so here's what you do.

212
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:54,980
Speaker 1: You buy these pieces, and then you get a better game, such as Descent, or those D&D ones where you use a grid of squares, and you just use your Ghostbusters pieces to play the other, better version of the same game.

213
00:12:55,501 --> 00:13:01,215
Speaker 0: I attack the Lord of Ravenloft Castle with my fighter.

214
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:02,017
Speaker 1: I mean, with Venkman.

215
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:21,199
Speaker 0: But the best thing that was pointed out to me when I was sort of alluding to the fact that I was going to talk about this game on the show tonight was someone pointed me at the rankings on BoardGameGeek, and basically, if you look at the 10 out of 10, 9 out of 10 ratings, it's people who say, "Yeah,

216
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:21,880
Speaker 0: Ghostbusters!".

217
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,397
Speaker 0: And if you look at the 4 out of 10, 3 out of 10, it's people who say, "Whoa, game

218
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:28,039
Speaker 0: mechanics!".

219
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:38,540
Speaker 0: The most frightening thing, though, is the Polygon review, because at the bottom, I'm going to read the paragraph they said, because I cannot link this to the game.

220
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,136
Speaker 0: Quote, "Overall, the game is a good

221
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:41,498
Speaker 0: value."

222
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,580
Speaker 0: For $85?

223
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,140
Speaker 1: The price of this is going to go way down.

224
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,252
Speaker 0: The PC game is like $15 right now.

225
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:52,480
Speaker 1: It costs way more to produce.

226
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,440
Speaker 0: The PC game is basically like a 45-minute long Ghostbusters movie.

227
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:01,055
Speaker 0: Is it bringing anything revolutionary to the experience?

228
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,080
Speaker 0: Not really.

229
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,860
Speaker 0: But it's an exceptional application of the theme and a deep gameplay experience.

230
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:10,739
Speaker 0: Polygon, what the fuck?

231
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:11,715
Speaker 1: Who wrote it?

232
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,368
Speaker 0: I'm going to see who wrote it right now.

233
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,040
Speaker 0: Hopefully it's not so-- Charlie Hall.

234
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,576
Speaker 1: Charlie Hall, what do you know about video games, board games, Charlie Hall?

235
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:19,260
Speaker 1: What do you know?

236
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:21,150
Speaker 0: Deep gameplay experience?

237
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,040
Speaker 0: I read these rules like 10 times.

238
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,752
Speaker 1: Have you even played a Knizia game in your life, Charlie Hall?

239
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:26,797
Speaker 1: I don't even know who you are.

240
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:27,440
Speaker 1: Maybe you have.

241
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:36,160
Speaker 0: But deep gameplay experience, Swords and Stronghold is a million times deeper than this game.

242
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,600
Speaker 1: That is true, and that's a game that takes like 5 to 10 minutes, once you know what you're doing.

243
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,060
Speaker 0: I also take issue with exceptional application of the theme, because the theme is not actually present in this game.

244
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:55,160
Speaker 0: Like, the proper nouns are there, and this vague notion of Ghostbusters, but the character's unique, like it's Venkman or whatever, right?

245
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,300
Speaker 1: Their powers are super generic, like-- This is power being sexist and jerky?

246
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:04,755
Speaker 0: The powers are things like, "Get an extra XP when you catch a ghost if you're already

247
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:05,498
Speaker 0: slimed.".

248
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:08,540
Speaker 0: It's like the most generic bullshit ever.

249
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:13,813
Speaker 1: Why are you so mad about this one game?

250
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,240
Speaker 1: There's so many of these things.

251
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:15,910
Speaker 0: I'm not mad.

252
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,417
Speaker 0: the game is bad.

253
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,620
Speaker 1: It's not the first example, nor will it be the last.

254
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,280
Speaker 0: I'm curious as to if the reviews saying the game are good are, because actually-- Are paid for?

255
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:31,220
Speaker 0: Because, full disclosure, after I originally trashed the game, I found out that I actually know a lot of people tangentially involved with this game.

256
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,177
Speaker 0: And multiple people actually emailed me and were like, "Uh, why are you so down on this

257
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:36,438
Speaker 0: game?".

258
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:43,720
Speaker 0: And I wonder if, one, I think a lot of people who review games know people associated with this project.

259
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,186
Speaker 1: It sounds like Gamergate talk.

260
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:48,499
Speaker 1: Some ethics and games journalism issues you're bringing up.

261
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:57,427
Speaker 0: I do think, however, while Gamergate is bullshit and you're obviously trying to trap me here-- I think you're just walking right into it.

262
00:15:57,467 --> 00:16:04,472
Speaker 1: I didn't think of that until two seconds ago, but you're basically saying, "Game Reviewer's friend with a game designer, ethics in this is for

263
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:04,613
Speaker 1: you.".

264
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,240
Speaker 1: That's exactly what you just said.

265
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,619
Speaker 0: Remember in The Wheel of Time when the girls are going to do that thing and they're like, "This is probably a

266
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:13,940
Speaker 0: trap.".

267
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,616
Speaker 0: And they're like, "Yeah, of course it's a fucking trap, but we gotta go

268
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:17,039
Speaker 0: anyway.".

269
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,796
Speaker 0: That's why I walked into this, because I think that did have it here.

270
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:34,180
Speaker 0: But two, I also think that a lot of people might have bought the game on Kickstarter, realized it's not great, but reviewed it before they got it and played it.

271
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,924
Speaker 1: That's another thing.

272
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:41,418
Speaker 1: There have been studies about wine and stuff where they're like, "Oh, the more expensive wine tastes

273
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:41,699
Speaker 1: better.".

274
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,760
Speaker 1: And there's also the one where it's like, "If you bought something, then you like it more after you bought

275
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:46,820
Speaker 1: it.".

276
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:51,339
Speaker 1: People are always like, "Oh, we expect reviewers to actually buy the things that they're

277
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:51,640
Speaker 1: reviewing.".

278
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,495
Speaker 1: It's like, "No, it's much better if they get it for

279
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:53,798
Speaker 1: free.".

280
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:03,340
Speaker 1: Because then they'll just judge the quality of the thing and they won't incorporate this force themselves to like it because they bought it thing.

281
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:11,579
Speaker 1: I'd much rather have people review something that they just got or played for free than something that they had to spend their money on and thus, flavor is their experience.

282
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:20,300
Speaker 0: In the end, basically, this game, it's not a bad game because it made its money and it's probably a really good game for little kids.

283
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,040
Speaker 0: This is the kind of game that grandma gets you for Christmas when you're eight years old.

284
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,940
Speaker 1: If I had it when I was in first grade and Ghostbusters was the number one thing, hell yeah, why not?

285
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:37,260
Speaker 0: And that's totally fine, but these reviewers who are adults, reviewing it on websites that basically only adults read, acting like there's a game here.

286
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,320
Speaker 1: I mean, most adults, when it comes to board games, don't like it very hard.

287
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,400
Speaker 0: I don't think most adults who will play this game could even look over how poorly skinned and really, really repetitive it is.

288
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,298
Speaker 1: These are the kind of people you try to teach them T&E and they're like, "Eh," and they roll their eyes and like, "Oh my

289
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:52,660
Speaker 1: God."

290
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:52,905
Speaker 1: I think.

291
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:58,740
Speaker 1: And this kind of people who play Munchkin are totally happy with it and will play it ten times at every single convention we go to.

292
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:02,739
Speaker 0: Alright, the people who like Munchkin will like this game, but people...

293
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,079
Speaker 1: People who can play Cards Against Humanity and not get tired of it.

294
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:11,900
Speaker 0: I think the Cards Against Humanity people would get real fucking tired of this game because you just do the same thing every round until you win.

295
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,440
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, there's most, you know, you go to places, there's a lot of those kind of people.

296
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,838
Speaker 0: But here's the difference, this game does not even have a mechanism of, "Whoa, something crazy happened because the mechanics are so

297
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:22,159
Speaker 0: simple.".

298
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,320
Speaker 0: Literally nothing crazy could ever happen.

299
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,316
Speaker 0: At least in Munchkin, "Oh my God, he won in one turn because of some crazy bullshit.

300
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:29,597
Speaker 1: Oh my

301
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:30,019
Speaker 1: God!".

302
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,829
Speaker 0: That can't even happen in this game.

303
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,439
Speaker 0: That's how bland and sterile it is.

304
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:35,219
Speaker 1: You're so mad about this.

305
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:36,880
Speaker 0: I am kind of mad about it.

306
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,159
Speaker 1: Alright, so another board game important news.

307
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:49,740
Speaker 1: A while ago, Asmodee, which is like, I guess, now like the biggest board game company there is, except unless you count Hasbro, which has Magic... I don't know, but it's super big in Europe.

308
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,698
Speaker 0: Well, because they've got, they're basically Fantasy Flight and Days of Wonder now.

309
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,240
Speaker 1: Right, they bought Fantasy Flight, they bought Days of Wonder, there's some gigantic board game conglomerate now.

310
00:18:57,941 --> 00:19:07,440
Speaker 1: And they basically announced this big thing where they're restructuring their distribution worldwide and in the US, including the Final Fantasy Flight, the Days of Wonder.

311
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,398
Speaker 1: And basically, what it means is this.

312
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:16,080
Speaker 1: So, first they had some ambiguous statement, but then they had a more clarifying statement in a press release.

313
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:23,060
Speaker 1: And basically what they're saying is, number one, they're changing/limiting to only certain distributors.

314
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,605
Speaker 1: Right, which is kind of fun.

315
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:27,420
Speaker 1: There's like five or six some distributors you can get their games from.

316
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,940
Speaker 0: Which is a sign of maturity in the industry.

317
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:30,620
Speaker 1: Sure, whatever.

318
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:43,820
Speaker 1: And they're going to basically make, the biggest part is that they're making these rules where if you're a game store, like you have bricks and mortars around your store and people walk into your store and play games.

319
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:48,600
Speaker 1: You're going to get a different distribution deal than someone who sells online.

320
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:59,160
Speaker 1: They're still going to allow online sales, but if you're a physical store, they won't let you sell online the stuff that you bought through that distribution deal.

321
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,705
Speaker 1: So it's similar to like, this is not some illegal thing.

322
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:11,320
Speaker 1: Apple does stuff like this all the time where you're the manufacturer and you have a special deal with the retailer where the retailer has to do what you say.

323
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:11,881
Speaker 1: Right.

324
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:16,410
Speaker 1: Best Buy can't discount iPods and IMAX and things because Apple says no.

325
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,957
Speaker 1: And if Best Buy does it, they'll just stop giving them iPods and IMAX.

326
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:21,359
Speaker 1: So Best Buy has to listen.

327
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:25,580
Speaker 0: Or acquire them at retail and mark them up, which isn't going to work.

328
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,482
Speaker 1: It's not going to work.

329
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:33,000
Speaker 1: So basically, if you're Amazon and you want to sell, I guess, Fantasy Flight games, you would buy them from a distributor and then sell them.

330
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:41,060
Speaker 1: But you would get a different deal at a different price, probably a higher price than the local game store, say the complete strategist would get buying them.

331
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:52,880
Speaker 1: And then, you know, the complete strategist would basically pay less for the same game than Amazon did and then hopefully would be able to sell it in their store for, you know, a competitive price with Amazon.

332
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:02,736
Speaker 1: And then, you know, the only thing is the complete strategist then would not be allowed to sell the games they bought on the Internet.

333
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:04,580
Speaker 1: They would only be allowed to sell them in their store.

334
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,700
Speaker 0: I'm going to be perfectly blunt here.

335
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,970
Speaker 1: And if they got caught selling them on the Internet at, you know, that higher margin, right?

336
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,140
Speaker 0: It would be an angry phone call to start.

337
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:13,521
Speaker 1: Right.

338
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,620
Speaker 1: They would stop getting, you know, they would stop getting games from the distributors.

339
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,360
Speaker 0: Or they might lose the sweetheart deal at brick and mortar stores.

340
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:19,807
Speaker 0: Who knows?

341
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:20,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

342
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:21,058
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't know that.

343
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:26,240
Speaker 0: Their rationale, because this is part of their press release, and this is very important because I'm going to be full.

344
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:30,660
Speaker 0: This is a good move for them and a good move for the tabletop games industry, in my opinion.

345
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,380
Speaker 0: Quote, "Asmodee North America is committed to brick and mortar hobby market specialty retailers.

346
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:51,756
Speaker 0: We are very hopeful that our upcoming policy changes will balance the existing marketplace to reflect the value of those outlets, providing outstanding customer experiences in a physical retail environment, and whom allow for so many gamers to enjoy events, demonstrations, and in-store

347
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:52,037
Speaker 0: play.".

348
00:21:52,940 --> 00:22:05,480
Speaker 0: So, on one hand, this incentivizes game stores to continue to exist because you actually do need the local game stores to be able to have the events, the tournaments, the teach and plays, the local community around the game.

349
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,954
Speaker 1: If there was no, you know, they only sell Netrunner tournament kits to stores.

350
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:10,360
Speaker 1: They don't sell them to just anybody.

351
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:15,173
Speaker 1: If they didn't have Netrunner tournaments, would I be playing this much Netrunner and keep buying all the cards?

352
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:17,480
Speaker 1: Probably not, because none of my friends play it with me.

353
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,239
Speaker 0: But, the reality is, most people want to buy things online, so...

354
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:23,995
Speaker 1: Well, most people don't even live where there's a game store.

355
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:33,439
Speaker 1: That's the real... A lot of the threads about this online, a lot of people are like... Because at first, before they had the clarifying press release, people were like, "Wait, they're not going to sell games online

356
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:33,760
Speaker 1: anymore?"

357
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:34,022
Speaker 1: Right?

358
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:35,720
Speaker 1: You know, they get everything messed up, right?

359
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:35,842
Speaker 1: Yup.

360
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:36,659
Speaker 1: Which is not true.

361
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,926
Speaker 1: But they're like, "Oh my god, how am I going to get games?

362
00:22:38,946 --> 00:22:43,899
Speaker 1: There's no game store within 30 minutes of me, and the one that's an hour away is a shithole, and they charge too much money...".

363
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,224
Speaker 1: Right?

364
00:22:44,940 --> 00:23:11,720
Speaker 0: Now, this is also a big move for the maturity of the tabletop industry, because it's always been really weird and amateur hour that so many tabletop games were sold online in these, like, third and fourth tier, like... Go to a game store website and buy it from this weird place, or buy it directly from the guy who made the game, and... That, like, that's cool for, like, the indie stuff, but it's weird in the mass market.

365
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:20,420
Speaker 0: And it was confusing for people, and it actually caused a lot of instances of, I guess I'd call it adverse arbitrage?

366
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:30,560
Speaker 0: Where people could, and I've done this, people would go to local game stores, buy a game, list it on Amazon for way more, because that game's actually worth a lot more, and the game store didn't know, and shit like that.

367
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,247
Speaker 0: So, there's no reason to have a million stores online selling the game.

368
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:43,820
Speaker 0: Only the malls, only the mass market distributors really need to have the wholesale channels and the distributor channels to sell online.

369
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,906
Speaker 0: People are gonna go to something like Amazon, or they're gonna physically go to their game store.

370
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:57,620
Speaker 0: The game store trying to sell online, or the anime store trying to sell online, or any of those specialty kinds of stores trying to sell online, not viable in the long run in the face of the mass market.

371
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,529
Speaker 1: Well, it also, the thing is, it might actually, you might think, "Oh, this is helping the game

372
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:01,769
Speaker 1: stores.".

373
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,736
Speaker 1: Now they can sell their games at a reasonable margin, right?

374
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:06,680
Speaker 1: You know, because they're getting a more discount.

375
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:12,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think a lot of game stores make a lot of money selling online to, like, the weird, dedicated, it's the...

376
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:23,420
Speaker 1: There are a lot of game stores, right, that will go, and they'll buy a shit ton of copies of a game, more than they can sell in their store, and sell all the extra ones online, because they know they can.

377
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, real talk, you can't be a consignment store like that anymore.

378
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:35,580
Speaker 1: Now, the local game store's gonna buy, like, three copies of a game that comes out, because that's all they can sell in their store physically, because that's how many physical customers they have.

379
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:42,470
Speaker 1: And now, even though the margin on those three copies is up, because they're getting a big discount for being a store, compared to that, right?

380
00:24:42,851 --> 00:24:48,740
Speaker 1: They can't sell any online, so their total revenues on that game are way lower.

381
00:24:48,800 --> 00:25:08,140
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, now, Amazon, who is allowed to sell online, is gonna buy a zillion copies at the worst price from the wholesaler, but they're gonna sell all the copies, and end up actually making more money, because they're not competing with every game store selling five copies each online, you know, individually.

382
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:15,240
Speaker 1: So, I don't really know if their plan of helping the local game store is actually gonna work out, just by giving them a better price.

383
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,160
Speaker 0: It's gonna help the local game stores.

384
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,740
Speaker 1: If they wanted to do that, they should just ban Amazon from selling games at all.

385
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,679
Speaker 0: But that would mean even I wouldn't be buying games.

386
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,380
Speaker 1: Sure, I mean, that's what I'm saying, is that hurts the people who don't have a game store near them, and have no other way to get them.

387
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:38,380
Speaker 0: It also pulls that anime crap, where the industry stays sort of weird, and not like other mainstream industries.

388
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,520
Speaker 0: And eventually causes this sort of, like, walling off inward-focused, navel-gazing disaster and collapse.

389
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:51,660
Speaker 1: I'm also curious, there are a few particular cases where this might cause a... may or may not cause a big disturbance, right?

390
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,959
Speaker 1: There's a store in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Team Covenant store, and I know about them, because...

391
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:57,140
Speaker 0: I know about that store!

392
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,840
Speaker 1: They do a lot of Netrunner stuff, and they interview Luke Crane a lot.

393
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:03,919
Speaker 1: Basically, they're a game store that only sells a few games, right?

394
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:08,140
Speaker 1: And they support those games like crazy, but they don't have, like, a huge game library in there.

395
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:14,000
Speaker 1: It's like, they really support a lot of few games, including all the Fantasy Flight competitive games, right?

396
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,300
Speaker 1: Like the Netrunners and the X-Wings and all that kind of stuff.

397
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:21,480
Speaker 1: So, the way they make their money being in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is obviously they have customers there.

398
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,700
Speaker 1: But most of their business, as far as I can tell, is selling online, like, subscriptions.

399
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:32,580
Speaker 1: So, it's like, if you want every Netrunner card, you can subscribe to them annually, and they'll send you every one as it comes out.

400
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,140
Speaker 1: They have a really close relationship with Fantasy Flight themselves, but is this... are they gonna get an exception?

401
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:48,380
Speaker 1: Or, are they gonna no longer be allowed to sell online and have to cancel their subscription business and basically ruin, I think, a lot of their revenues as a whole?

402
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,180
Speaker 1: I don't... no one said anything about that.

403
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,920
Speaker 0: Well, there's another part of the press release, just give me a second while I stall, because I have to pull up a different article that I was looking at about this.

404
00:26:56,361 --> 00:27:08,700
Speaker 0: But, while I'm stalling, the reality is that kind of, like, the brick-and-mortar store that actually makes most of its money selling stuff online just isn't viable in the modern world.

405
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,040
Speaker 1: What about that little place that sells goods over next to the reso box?

406
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:16,432
Speaker 0: Do they sell most of their stuff online?

407
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:17,620
Speaker 0: Is it stuff I can't get on Amazon?

408
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:19,900
Speaker 1: I mean, it's just, you know, tchotchkes and whatnot.

409
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's the thing.

410
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:29,320
Speaker 0: If they make all their revenue like that, that store is basically acting like a warehouse that happens to open their doors like the arcade was.

411
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,760
Speaker 0: Oh, here we go, here we go, here's the other... Isn't that what complete strategy is?

412
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,900
Speaker 0: An announcement by Asmodee quoted Christian Peterson.

413
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,420
Speaker 1: That's the president or whatever of Fantasy Flight.

414
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,100
Speaker 0: "The marketplace has long been distorted by providing one-size-fits-all sales terms to every retail account regardless of its channel of sale.

415
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:50,478
Speaker 0: The growth in demand for games over the last decade and our view has been fueled not only by blah-blah-blah retailers and even

416
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:51,020
Speaker 0: players.".

417
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:55,299
Speaker 0: I'm trying to find that there's a quote in here that was instrumental to this.

418
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:09,900
Speaker 0: "The retailer cost of providing such channel services is significant and so we're now making policy changes to ensure that sales terms provided to those retailers relative to other channels are positively reflective of the value they add to our distribution

419
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,100
Speaker 0: chain.".

420
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:13,880
Speaker 0: So quote, they say that basically the only...

421
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,280
Speaker 1: In other words, we're going to give retailers a lower price than we give internet stores.

422
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:28,639
Speaker 0: The only online retailers that will get the deal are quote, "significant scale, unique service, or other exceptional

423
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:28,980
Speaker 0: differentiation.".

424
00:28:30,722 --> 00:28:32,620
Speaker 1: Team Covenant sounds like they have those things.

425
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,500
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure Team Covenant's okay, but like...

426
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,640
Speaker 1: They have exceptional differentiation and unique service.

427
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,040
Speaker 0: But like the Dragon's Den and Poughkeepsie, probably not going to get the deal.

428
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:40,522
Speaker 0: No.

429
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,160
Speaker 1: I mean, they're going to get the lower price for being a retailer, but they're not going to be able to sell online.

430
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:44,762
Speaker 0: Exactly.

431
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:45,929
Speaker 0: I don't know if they sell online.

432
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,720
Speaker 0: I don't even know if they have a website.

433
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,860
Speaker 1: Why would you buy from them online?

434
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:58,290
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

435
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:04,670
Speaker 0: As you all know who have been watching my channel, I played through all of Undertale and it's a pretty fantastic game.

436
00:29:05,231 --> 00:29:16,810
Speaker 0: But I found this YouTube channel, Adrisaurus, and she took songs from Undertale, wrote really good lyrics to them, and then performed them.

437
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,709
Speaker 0: And I know that's a thing that nerds do with games that they like these days, or shows that they like.

438
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:30,430
Speaker 0: But this is so high quality and so well done from every perspective that I'm kind of dumbfounded.

439
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:32,148
Speaker 0: You should seriously check these out.

440
00:29:34,032 --> 00:29:36,462
Speaker 0: I didn't look into her details at all, but I'm going to link to her.

441
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:38,290
Speaker 0: She has a Patreon and Twitter and all that stuff.

442
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,289
Speaker 0: I'm just going to link to her and one of these.

443
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:46,410
Speaker 0: But I know a lot about music theory and composition and arrangement.

444
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,830
Speaker 0: And in my opinion, these are very well done.

445
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:56,810
Speaker 0: The bar to doing these in a way that I will notice has been raised significantly by this one person.

446
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,449
Speaker 0: These are great.

447
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:05,130
Speaker 1: So there's two boy schools and they had some sort of chess competition between them or something.

448
00:30:06,052 --> 00:30:11,130
Speaker 1: And apparently one of the competitors was like a huge jerk, like everyone hated him for whatever.

449
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,150
Speaker 1: He probably had an attitude or was super confident, right?

450
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:19,370
Speaker 1: So here is like a one minute, not even clip.

451
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,310
Speaker 0: 23 seconds, I believe.

452
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:30,810
Speaker 1: 23 second clip of the most important moment in this high pressure chess match, which is mostly high pressure because of the jerkiness.

453
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:40,610
Speaker 1: Well, they suppose it according to the Internet, bad behavior and general disliking of the player who is closer to the bottom of the image.

454
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:45,590
Speaker 0: It appears that Uppence has come and it might have been a wombo combo, wombo combo moment.

455
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:46,146
Speaker 1: Maybe.

456
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:50,250
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, we're going to be at Pac South.

457
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,269
Speaker 0: That's actually coming up like it's not that far away.

458
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,228
Speaker 1: It's so soon.

459
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:57,330
Speaker 0: We're doing three panels.

460
00:30:57,631 --> 00:30:59,810
Speaker 0: Well, we're doing two panels and I'm on a third panel.

461
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:03,250
Speaker 0: So Atari Game Design and Designing Game Rules.

462
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:05,510
Speaker 0: Two brand new Geek Nights lectures.

463
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,529
Speaker 0: And then scared yet?

464
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:14,790
Speaker 0: A discussion of horror games, which is me, Chris Straub, Susan Arndt, Dave Allen from Penny Arcade.

465
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:20,669
Speaker 0: So it's going to be basically, I'm probably mostly going to talk about Five Nights at Freddy's.

466
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:23,090
Speaker 1: What are the horror games have you played?

467
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:26,688
Speaker 0: Well, I might argue- Silent Hills?

468
00:31:27,411 --> 00:31:29,930
Speaker 0: I might argue what is and is not a horror game.

469
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,696
Speaker 1: Resident Evils?

470
00:31:30,757 --> 00:31:31,950
Speaker 1: I don't think Resident Evil is a horror game.

471
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:34,950
Speaker 1: At best- It's a puzzle game and/or action game.

472
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,329
Speaker 0: Some of the Resident Evils are close to survival horror, but they're not horror.

473
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:43,390
Speaker 1: You want to do a horror game, you should check out that old, that Japanese one with the clock tower or whatever.

474
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:45,584
Speaker 0: Oh, whoa, D?

475
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:50,050
Speaker 1: Not D. No, the one where the girl walks around and it's, you know- What about Fatal Frame?

476
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:51,650
Speaker 1: I don't know if that counts, maybe.

477
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:53,890
Speaker 0: That's the kind of stuff we're going to talk about.

478
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:59,349
Speaker 0: I imagine part of this panel is going to be arguing about what horror actually is.

479
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,950
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's going to be an awesome PAX out.

480
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:05,201
Speaker 1: You can just judge that from film.

481
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,750
Speaker 1: We know it makes a horror film.

482
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you don't have to play films.

483
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,650
Speaker 0: And also some films, is it horror or is it just a slasher thriller?

484
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:13,989
Speaker 1: Mmm, I don't know.

485
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,930
Speaker 0: Are Jason games, are Jason movies actually horror?

486
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,213
Speaker 0: What about Freddy vs.

487
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:23,390
Speaker 0: Jason, which is basically just edging into torture porn and also basically comedy?

488
00:32:24,112 --> 00:32:25,257
Speaker 0: So, what's the line?

489
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:29,190
Speaker 0: I guess a bunch of smart people and me- Only Rim thinks torture porn is funny.

490
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:32,010
Speaker 0: I thought Each of the Killer was mostly hilarious.

491
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:35,694
Speaker 0: Mostly.

492
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:38,290
Speaker 0: There's a couple moments that are not hilarious.

493
00:32:38,872 --> 00:32:39,997
Speaker 1: Any other meta-ness?

494
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:46,730
Speaker 1: Oh, holidays are like, I don't know where you live in the world, listener, but the holidays of the United States are very soon, like now.

495
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, Christmas is like two days from now.

496
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,430
Speaker 1: The day you're listening to this is just probably Wednesday or depending on where you live.

497
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,329
Speaker 1: I'm going to go to sleep after recording this and wake up.

498
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,627
Speaker 1: That day I'm barely working and then I'm not working again until January 4th.

499
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,770
Speaker 1: So don't expect there to be a lot of geek nights between now and 2016.

500
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,870
Speaker 0: But we are going to do a show on Christmas Eve.

501
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:07,848
Speaker 1: Are we?

502
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:09,255
Speaker 1: Yeah.

503
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,925
Speaker 0: You told me what we're doing the show on.

504
00:33:11,945 --> 00:33:13,130
Speaker 0: We added it to our calendar.

505
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:14,089
Speaker 1: I'll see if I'm here.

506
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,169
Speaker 0: You remember what the show is?

507
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,109
Speaker 1: I'll just see if I'm here.

508
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:17,309
Speaker 0: The Santa lie.

509
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:18,065
Speaker 1: Okay.

510
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,030
Speaker 0: You pointedly were like, this is what we're doing the show on.

511
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:22,389
Speaker 1: Alright, but will I be here?

512
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,390
Speaker 0: Well, if you're going to be gone, let's do that tomorrow then.

513
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll find out.

514
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:26,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could do it right now.

515
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,906
Speaker 1: Well, tomorrow I don't want to come over here because I'm leaving work early.

516
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:29,410
Speaker 1: I just go home.

517
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,634
Speaker 1: No.

518
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,809
Speaker 1: I don't want to come back here.

519
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,510
Speaker 0: Alright, if you said we'd do this show and now I've shit-talked if we don't do the show anyway.

520
00:33:36,672 --> 00:33:36,995
Speaker 1: Whatever.

521
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:37,703
Speaker 1: It's not my fault.

522
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:38,310
Speaker 1: I didn't shit-talk.

523
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this is like the first time ever you came to me and were like, this is what we're doing the show on.

524
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,482
Speaker 0: Usually it's-.

525
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,390
Speaker 1: That doesn't mean I said we're definitely doing the show on that day.

526
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,393
Speaker 0: Yeah, you did.

527
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,222
Speaker 0: You said let's do it on Christmas.

528
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:50,830
Speaker 0: I can pull up the chat log if I need to.

529
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,369
Speaker 1: Okay, but you know, I might not be here.

530
00:33:52,771 --> 00:33:53,741
Speaker 0: Where are you even going?

531
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:54,590
Speaker 0: Home to Connecticut?

532
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

533
00:33:56,791 --> 00:34:02,590
Speaker 0: But there will be a bunch of Patreon exclusive stuff because there's two Rims Rants for our Patreons.

534
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,930
Speaker 0: And while we're not doing gig nights because we're busy with holidays, I'm going to keep putting stuff up there.

535
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,489
Speaker 1: Well, in addition to being busy with holidays, I'm also not working a lot, so I'm actually going to have a lot of time.

536
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:24,030
Speaker 1: And if I actually decide to make something instead of just eating and laying around, I'm going to make free stuff to compete with Rims, not free stuff.

537
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:29,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, watch Scott's YouTube livestream, YouTube Gaming, because he'll probably be using it a lot in the next few weeks.

538
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:31,967
Speaker 1: Steam sale started.

539
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:39,489
Speaker 0: So in the December Q&A, one of the questions, because I skimmed him, that came from the Patreons for that show, basically they asked what the fuck happened to Beantown.

540
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,250
Speaker 0: And I think today we figured out what to do instead of Beantown.

541
00:34:43,672 --> 00:34:44,949
Speaker 1: You still shit-talked on that too.

542
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,870
Speaker 0: I did, because you know what?

543
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,549
Speaker 1: You're such a shit-talker.

544
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:52,510
Speaker 0: In the Patreon exclusive Q&A episode, I'm going to talk about why I'm not making Beantown anymore.

545
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:53,849
Speaker 0: Fuck Beantown.

546
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:54,378
Speaker 0: Okay.

547
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,590
Speaker 0: Beantown is now Project ST again.

548
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,149
Speaker 0: Okay.

549
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,221
Speaker 0: And Project ST is a really good idea.

550
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:00,450
Speaker 0: Scott had the best idea.

551
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:03,459
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll finish it without you.

552
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,905
Speaker 1: I've got a whole week of doing nothing.

553
00:35:04,926 --> 00:35:05,830
Speaker 1: Are you going to work next week?

554
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,530
Speaker 0: Uh, partly.

555
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,270
Speaker 1: No, I'm not going to work at all.

556
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:15,310
Speaker 0: If you can finish that game next week without me, my hat is off to you, sir.

557
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:20,970
Speaker 1: If I'm doing nothing, like not even going to work, and I don't do anything else, like play some games.

558
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,290
Speaker 0: Except I suspect you're going to play some Rocket League.

559
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:25,189
Speaker 1: No, I haven't played that in a long time.

560
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,150
Speaker 0: Is it done with Rocket League?

561
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,730
Speaker 1: Until they fix matchmaking, there's no point.

562
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:31,150
Speaker 0: I'm not having a lot of trouble with matchmaking lately, actually.

563
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,209
Speaker 1: Oh, you've got to get a little bit better.

564
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,167
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

565
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,241
Speaker 1: Just a little bit better.

566
00:35:34,261 --> 00:35:34,949
Speaker 1: You'll hit the line.

567
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:43,890
Speaker 0: So, as we'd mentioned before when we went to that party, is we played a ton of local multiplayer games.

568
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,330
Speaker 0: Not necessarily co-op, just shared screen local multiplayer, like Screen Sheet and Starwall.

569
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,830
Speaker 1: And there's a significant shortage of these kinds of games in the world.

570
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,330
Speaker 0: There are a lot of them, but most of them are really bad.

571
00:35:54,531 --> 00:35:58,610
Speaker 1: And a lot of them are like just, you know, there are certain genres that have a lot of them.

572
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,850
Speaker 1: For example, the side-scrolling brawler, like a Streets of Rage.

573
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,650
Speaker 1: It's like this co-op and all those, Pit Fighter, Final Fight.

574
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,010
Speaker 1: But, you know, they're usually only two people.

575
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:12,110
Speaker 1: If you've got an X-Men arcade machine, you can get six people, but then only it's not super attention-holding.

576
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,110
Speaker 1: Walk sideways and punch everything until it's over, right?

577
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,362
Speaker 0: I mean, I put probably like $80 or $90 into arcade machines of that genre.

578
00:36:21,611 --> 00:36:22,650
Speaker 1: Ninja Turtles, Simpsons.

579
00:36:23,112 --> 00:36:28,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly Simpsons and playing Hagar and just doing the butt-slam over and over and over and over again.

580
00:36:31,057 --> 00:36:32,250
Speaker 0: Play loose a little bit of that at Magfest.

581
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:38,410
Speaker 0: But these games are also interesting because people seem to really want to play them.

582
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:43,349
Speaker 0: But, like I said, a lot of them are actually really, really, really bad.

583
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:45,869
Speaker 0: Or not actually that fun.

584
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:52,350
Speaker 0: Or have the worst menus and GUIs in the world and we can't even get them to start with multiple players properly.

585
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:54,870
Speaker 1: Magica's not bad for the co-op area.

586
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:55,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, Magica's okay.

587
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:59,049
Speaker 1: Especially local because then you don't have to deal with the stupid internet problems.

588
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,649
Speaker 0: But I'm actually way more interested in the Artho game competitive ones.

589
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:05,530
Speaker 1: That support more than two people.

590
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,372
Speaker 0: Yep.

591
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:08,970
Speaker 0: Also because the co-op ones usually, like say you're at a party.

592
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,630
Speaker 1: Right, there's plenty of local competitive games, but they're usually fighting games.

593
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,970
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of, you know, I mean it's like a Nidhogg.

594
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:18,726
Speaker 1: You know, it's like Street Fighter.

595
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:26,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean for a party game with local multiplayer, it's like Mount Your Friends, Jackbox, you know.

596
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:34,304
Speaker 0: But the reason I focus on that is that with a co-op game, like if you're at a party and your friend's like, "Hey, let's play this four player co-op

597
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:34,566
Speaker 0: game."

598
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:39,990
Speaker 0: The four of you play it for a couple hours instead of being in the party hanging out.

599
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:44,487
Speaker 0: If it's a fighty game like, "Hey, let's do one of these fighty games like

600
00:37:44,507 --> 00:37:44,949
Speaker 0: Starwall."

601
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:49,810
Speaker 0: Then people are rotating in and out like an arcade for the entire party.

602
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,330
Speaker 0: Like the four people playing at the end of the party are not the people who started playing.

603
00:37:53,570 --> 00:38:02,470
Speaker 1: Right, but it's weird that like this genre, this category is so weak that I can like name every reasonably okay game in this category.

604
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:08,110
Speaker 0: So I suspect because I overheard you playing this game that we might disagree because I think TowerFall is one of the best of these.

605
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,089
Speaker 1: Oh, it's so bad.

606
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:09,652
Speaker 1: Why?

607
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:14,990
Speaker 0: So, seriously, TowerFall, Matt Thorson, pretty recent game, like 2013.

608
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,990
Speaker 0: Four player, multiplayer, shoot arrows at each other on a screen, single screen, no scrolling.

609
00:38:21,373 --> 00:38:23,289
Speaker 0: I think it's a fantastic game and I love the shit out of it.

610
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,670
Speaker 1: Alright, so the concept of this game is a fantastic game, right?

611
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:33,150
Speaker 1: It's basically like Atari Combat, you know, where you're a character on the screen and you're trying to shoot the other people and when they're all dead you win, right?

612
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:38,850
Speaker 1: So conceptually it's good and it does a mix up on Atari Combat by making it a platforming.

613
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:41,850
Speaker 1: And you shoot this arrow in one of the eight cardinal directions.

614
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,470
Speaker 0: But you only start with like two arrows.

615
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can run out of them and then they stick in the wall and you can pick them up, which is cute, right?

616
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,975
Speaker 1: And it only takes one shot to kill, right?

617
00:38:52,035 --> 00:38:53,559
Speaker 1: And you know, so it's like.

618
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,650
Speaker 1: conceptually this game is really good and it also has things like really good music, right?

619
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,210
Speaker 0: It has the Atari/Orthur game thing of a million, million, million options.

620
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:11,090
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, there's plenty of, you know, if you get bored of one mode, there's like so many modes and customizations that it really would be hard to get bored of it if you like it because you can keep changing it up, right?

621
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:20,730
Speaker 1: My problem with the game is simply that it's not, the lack of polish on the specific implementation makes it really, really hard to play.

622
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,452
Speaker 1: In what way?

623
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:26,650
Speaker 0: Because I am super good at this game and was super good at it immediately the first time I touched it.

624
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,954
Speaker 1: Right, so I mean, I wasn't bad at it.

625
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:29,479
Speaker 1: I won like one or two games, right?

626
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,024
Speaker 1: It wasn't a problem of, "Oh, I'm bad at

627
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:31,305
Speaker 1: this.".

628
00:39:31,385 --> 00:39:31,786
Speaker 1: It was a problem.

629
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:32,910
Speaker 1: It was just, it was so frustrating.

630
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,430
Speaker 1: So here are the things I find frustrating about this game.

631
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:35,844
Speaker 1: All right.

632
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:41,610
Speaker 1: So they went with the pixelated graphics, which aesthetically I like, just looking at them, you know, aesthetically.

633
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:48,748
Speaker 1: But as the game works, you know, at least even on a giant television we were playing this thing, right?

634
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:49,229
Speaker 1: With the PS4.

635
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,519
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a matter of, "Oh, I can't see.

636
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:52,986
Speaker 1: It's too small and I have the best

637
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:53,348
Speaker 1: vision.".

638
00:39:53,850 --> 00:40:00,630
Speaker 1: But because things were pixelated and there wasn't a lot of contrast between characters in the background or things in the background.

639
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,642
Speaker 1: It's like you really couldn't tell what the fuck was going on.

640
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,510
Speaker 1: Like a lot of times I couldn't find my character.

641
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:14,370
Speaker 1: I couldn't tell if I was being, if the thing falling was another character or myself or if the character was dead or alive or if that was an arrow or a trap or a what.

642
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:18,650
Speaker 1: It's like you just can't see what's going on because it's like you play Smash Brothers.

643
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:25,970
Speaker 1: It's like you can see like that tiny thing is clearly that particular item because the graphic design is just so good.

644
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:34,370
Speaker 1: And you need to have that level of graphical clarity in this kind of game or else it's just like I can't even tell where the fuck I am or what's going on.

645
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:38,210
Speaker 0: So counterpoint, while I do agree that the character sprites should pop more.

646
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,990
Speaker 1: Character sprites are the worst of all of the things by far.

647
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,501
Speaker 0: But I did not have that problem at all and I had the added experience of.

648
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:48,930
Speaker 0: I took a bunch of different people in a bunch of different situations.

649
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,750
Speaker 0: Like since we first started playing this game who had never played this game before.

650
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,309
Speaker 0: Some of them are gamers, some of them like just don't play games.

651
00:40:56,071 --> 00:41:01,490
Speaker 0: And I basically introduced it to them and watched them experience it and start to play it for the first time.

652
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,248
Speaker 0: And you know what I saw?

653
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:12,330
Speaker 0: They pretty much all without exception, gamer or not, achieved mastery or at least like got past all those issues you were talking about within, I don't know, three plays.

654
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:15,850
Speaker 0: And did not have this confusion problem that you were having.

655
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:19,710
Speaker 1: Alright, well I basically couldn't tell where I was on the screen like half the time.

656
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:25,510
Speaker 1: Especially because problem number two, the game starts you in a random spawn position, one of four spots.

657
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:32,610
Speaker 1: And unlike say Bomberman which goes like, you know, you're getting ready and you can find where you are before the game actually starts.

658
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,449
Speaker 1: It's basically, here you go, go!

659
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:39,870
Speaker 1: And it doesn't give you any fucking time to figure out which of the four corners you're in and then you're dead before you even get to do anything.

660
00:41:41,136 --> 00:41:42,030
Speaker 1: I did not have that problem.

661
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:47,830
Speaker 1: You gotta give me like three seconds to figure out which of the corners I'm in or spawn me in the same corner every time.

662
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:50,430
Speaker 0: You really had that much trouble, there's only so many pixels.

663
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:58,430
Speaker 1: I died at least like five, six times because I couldn't figure, because I couldn't know which corner I was in at the start and then I was dead while I was still looking.

664
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:04,186
Speaker 1: The game started and I haven't even pushed a button because I'm looking to see am I the guy in the top left or the bottom right?

665
00:42:04,426 --> 00:42:05,810
Speaker 1: and then I'm dead before I push a button.

666
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:10,970
Speaker 0: See I guess I didn't have this problem because I'd look at the screen and I'd see the yellow ones in the bottom left and I was good.

667
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:14,670
Speaker 1: Well maybe it's because I was the blue one and there isn't enough differentiation between the blue and the green.

668
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:18,790
Speaker 0: I played the blue one, I like the blue guy a lot but I go with yellow because it's a crazy old laughing man.

669
00:42:19,092 --> 00:42:21,970
Speaker 1: Well maybe the yellow is a better idea because none of the other ones are even close to yellow.

670
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,036
Speaker 0: In fact the only time that's a problem is if two people pick very similar characters.

671
00:42:26,397 --> 00:42:33,650
Speaker 0: but as soon as I achieved a little bit of mastery I started doing that on purpose because it didn't affect me but it really fucked up the other guy.

672
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:34,771
Speaker 1: Alright.

673
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:36,978
Speaker 1: so problem number three is the controls.

674
00:42:37,178 --> 00:42:40,830
Speaker 1: Now they're not the worst controls, they're not like bad NES game controls.

675
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:47,700
Speaker 1: Right and they didn't make a mistake of like you know necessarily the only mistake they made in terms of choosing which button does.

676
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:48,702
Speaker 1: what is that?

677
00:42:48,742 --> 00:42:49,563
Speaker 1: to double jump?

678
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:54,030
Speaker 1: you don't actually press jump twice, you jump and then have to dash while holding up.

679
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,790
Speaker 0: Because it's not a double jump, you can't go up again.

680
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:02,178
Speaker 1: There is no double jump but you can dash upwards which is so unintuitive right?

681
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:10,110
Speaker 1: it's like I would have just made you know jumping while in the air be the dash and get rid of the stupid you know R and L for dashing.

682
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,375
Speaker 0: See now I will give you that.

683
00:43:11,395 --> 00:43:15,710
Speaker 0: in that I think I like the fact that you can grab onto ledges the quality.

684
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,269
Speaker 1: Well grabbing onto ledges is fine yeah.

685
00:43:18,818 --> 00:43:20,209
Speaker 0: But because it doesn't do...

686
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,065
Speaker 1: But why can't I dash by just pressing jump again while in the air to the left?

687
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:26,810
Speaker 1: Why do I have to press L to jump to dash?

688
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:40,844
Speaker 0: My specific minor complaint is that because people are used to double jump working a certain way in other games in this game I will even after getting really good at it occasionally jump and then I'll hit jump again.

689
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:46,710
Speaker 0: but that'll cause me to jump off the wall instead of double jumping because this game double jumping works differently.

690
00:43:46,931 --> 00:43:49,717
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean that's the only problem with the bindings.

691
00:43:50,078 --> 00:43:54,990
Speaker 1: the problem I have with the controls is that you're just a little bit loosey-goosey right.

692
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,659
Speaker 1: They're not super bad like oh my god I can't control this guy at all.

693
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,726
Speaker 1: right it's like you can shoot the arrow in the direction you're thinking of shooting it.

694
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,090
Speaker 1: you know it's like you're not having that problem.

695
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:05,750
Speaker 0: And the arrows auto aim a little bit to get around the fact.

696
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,595
Speaker 1: They actually visibly home.

697
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:08,818
Speaker 1: it's not like they're auto aiming.

698
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:13,090
Speaker 1: you the arrow when it gets close to an enemy actually swerves and homes in on them a little bit.

699
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,667
Speaker 0: Which I think is clever because that gets around because otherwise.

700
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:17,977
Speaker 1: You're aiming in eight directions.

701
00:44:18,017 --> 00:44:21,530
Speaker 1: it would be like impossible to precisely hit people if it didn't have that homing.

702
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:22,850
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with that.

703
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,903
Speaker 0: It makes the game be more about like anticipating what your opponent's gonna do like.

704
00:44:27,184 --> 00:44:27,967
Speaker 0: is he gonna shoot at me?

705
00:44:28,007 --> 00:44:28,930
Speaker 0: well I could shoot at him.

706
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,210
Speaker 1: It's not about Super Meat Boy precision right.

707
00:44:32,831 --> 00:44:35,730
Speaker 0: Well once you get a little bit good it actually really is.

708
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,511
Speaker 1: It becomes that.

709
00:44:36,531 --> 00:44:38,276
Speaker 1: but the problem is that it doesn't.

710
00:44:38,757 --> 00:44:40,602
Speaker 1: the controls are not as tight as Super Meat Boy.

711
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:43,330
Speaker 1: they're definitely not as tight as Mario 3 or Mario World right.

712
00:44:43,752 --> 00:44:47,346
Speaker 1: So you just need you know the characters you know are slip a little bit.

713
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:48,230
Speaker 1: it feels like they move.

714
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,390
Speaker 1: I think it's also part of the speed factor right.

715
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:53,080
Speaker 0: The game is very fast which you know it's.

716
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,144
Speaker 1: it's fine if it's fast.

717
00:44:54,164 --> 00:44:55,530
Speaker 1: Super Meat Boy is fast right.

718
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,761
Speaker 1: But it you know it's it's a little bit you know.

719
00:44:59,182 --> 00:45:01,090
Speaker 1: I think the acceleration is just off right.

720
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:04,845
Speaker 1: It's the actual maximum velocity isn't a problem you know it's.

721
00:45:04,865 --> 00:45:06,190
Speaker 1: the acceleration is very quick.

722
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,580
Speaker 1: It goes from like nothing to too fast oh my god.

723
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,162
Speaker 1: and then you're dead.

724
00:45:09,202 --> 00:45:10,950
Speaker 1: and yeah like you don't even know what you did.

725
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:17,410
Speaker 0: It's interesting because my experience of play was when you first start playing like your first few games it seems so frantic and you just die.

726
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,721
Speaker 0: It's like playing Counter Strike for the first time like what the fuck just happened.

727
00:45:20,103 --> 00:45:21,330
Speaker 0: let's play again what the fuck just happened.

728
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:27,543
Speaker 0: But then you start to see through the matrix and suddenly becomes this very like tight game of like.

729
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:30,690
Speaker 0: grab the arrow out of the air and shoot it right back at that motherfucker.

730
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:37,662
Speaker 1: Yeah so I mean you know it has these kinds of issues in it especially with like.

731
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:40,550
Speaker 1: we played with a bunch of items too right for example.

732
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,151
Speaker 0: You've got to.

733
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:45,700
Speaker 0: I think you've got to introduce the items one by one and be like just base game until you like.

734
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,090
Speaker 0: get it and be like okay now we're gonna play where you might get some bramble arrows and here's what they do.

735
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:51,491
Speaker 0: Right.

736
00:45:51,511 --> 00:45:54,290
Speaker 1: so when we played they turned all these items on like right away.

737
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,795
Speaker 0: Well they assumed you were a pro and I couldn't even tell.

738
00:45:56,895 --> 00:45:57,897
Speaker 1: I couldn't even tell when someone.

739
00:45:57,937 --> 00:45:59,280
Speaker 1: this goes back to the graphics thing.

740
00:45:59,601 --> 00:46:03,630
Speaker 1: I couldn't even tell when someone had an item or what it did or anything right.

741
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,698
Speaker 1: It was just like why did I die there?

742
00:46:05,738 --> 00:46:06,301
Speaker 1: I jumped on you.

743
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:08,230
Speaker 1: I heard the shield and it's like I couldn't see that.

744
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,427
Speaker 1: Dude it makes a giant shield around the character.

745
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:12,339
Speaker 1: The shield is the easiest thing to see.

746
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,189
Speaker 1: but I didn't know the shield blocked jumping right.

747
00:46:15,152 --> 00:46:15,326
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

748
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:16,713
Speaker 1: And how was I supposed to know that?

749
00:46:16,813 --> 00:46:22,668
Speaker 1: and like you know especially like I'm about to jump on someone they would get a shield in them but while I was coming at them.

750
00:46:22,728 --> 00:46:23,450
Speaker 1: and then you know.

751
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,830
Speaker 1: So when I introduced this game to people.

752
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,958
Speaker 1: So I was like listen let's do no items mode like turn all this shit off right.

753
00:46:28,978 --> 00:46:33,447
Speaker 1: because I realized like there were times where like someone would get the crown you can't see that crown.

754
00:46:33,488 --> 00:46:34,450
Speaker 1: it's tiny as fuck.

755
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,537
Speaker 1: Right it's like.

756
00:46:35,578 --> 00:46:36,430
Speaker 1: how was I supposed to know it.

757
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,468
Speaker 0: Well do you know what the crown is?

758
00:46:37,873 --> 00:46:39,650
Speaker 1: It's like it's the losers catch up mechanism.

759
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,550
Speaker 0: No the crown means that person's winning.

760
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,869
Speaker 1: Oh is that what it is?

761
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:43,140
Speaker 1: Yeah.

762
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,270
Speaker 1: I thought there was also a lose.

763
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,409
Speaker 1: It always tells you.

764
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,930
Speaker 1: The shield is the catch up mechanism.

765
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,081
Speaker 1: If you've been losing a lot.

766
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:48,910
Speaker 1: it gives you the shield.

767
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:51,670
Speaker 0: No the crown means gang up on that mother fucker because he's about to win.

768
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,183
Speaker 1: But it's like you couldn't see this shit.

769
00:46:53,203 --> 00:46:53,910
Speaker 1: it was so tiny.

770
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:55,972
Speaker 1: So I was like turn all this garbage off.

771
00:46:56,012 --> 00:46:59,558
Speaker 1: and when they did turn all the garbage off it became a significantly better.

772
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:04,505
Speaker 1: but it still had those other issues that just frustrated me enough to where it's like.

773
00:47:04,545 --> 00:47:07,550
Speaker 1: well you know this game isn't so great that I need to actually keep playing.

774
00:47:07,651 --> 00:47:08,588
Speaker 1: And deal with this BS.

775
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:11,150
Speaker 0: See it's interesting that you were so frustrated so quickly.

776
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,670
Speaker 1: It was a lot better turning off all the stupid items.

777
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:14,594
Speaker 0: Because I went the opposite.

778
00:47:14,674 --> 00:47:17,810
Speaker 0: I introduced everyone of nothing just like basic game.

779
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:21,210
Speaker 1: You started with the no items we started with like a zillion items on all over the place.

780
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,872
Speaker 0: And we played like just in a group.

781
00:47:22,912 --> 00:47:37,550
Speaker 0: like everyone was really into the game like people who had never played it before got really fucking into it like to a degree that I did not expect which was in fact I would not have given this game as much like second look if it hadn't been for the fact that every noob who had never played it before that I made play except you.

782
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:42,390
Speaker 0: Got weirdly into it way faster than I would expect normal people to get into it.

783
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,412
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean it's just.

784
00:47:43,452 --> 00:47:45,037
Speaker 1: it's so you know.

785
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:48,348
Speaker 1: honestly the game I would play instead of this would be scorched earth.

786
00:47:48,629 --> 00:47:48,830
Speaker 1: right.

787
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:50,648
Speaker 0: Except scorched earth if you're good.

788
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:51,349
Speaker 1: It's not real time.

789
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:52,808
Speaker 0: Well I know scorched earth can be.

790
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:54,030
Speaker 0: There's that one mode.

791
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:54,659
Speaker 1: That game mode.

792
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:55,148
Speaker 1: don't do that.

793
00:47:55,570 --> 00:48:02,650
Speaker 0: But the problem with scorched earth is if you actually get good at scorched earth you hit with every bomb all the time and you like the game's just stupid.

794
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:03,663
Speaker 1: You gotta play with all the shit.

795
00:48:03,684 --> 00:48:04,130
Speaker 1: but that's the thing.

796
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,329
Speaker 1: No you don't even need all the shit.

797
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:07,070
Speaker 0: Doesn't even matter.

798
00:48:07,813 --> 00:48:09,210
Speaker 0: You'll just hit every time.

799
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,489
Speaker 0: Some Mervs.

800
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:13,770
Speaker 0: I mean I got real good at scorched earth and no one would play it with me anymore in middle school.

801
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:14,610
Speaker 1: I'll play scorched earth.

802
00:48:14,971 --> 00:48:15,414
Speaker 0: You want to play.

803
00:48:15,696 --> 00:48:17,490
Speaker 0: you want to live stream some scorched earth?

804
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:18,929
Speaker 1: I'll play scorched earth every day.

805
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:19,541
Speaker 0: I will.

806
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:23,069
Speaker 0: We could run it on a giant monitor with tiny little tanks.

807
00:48:24,353 --> 00:48:25,290
Speaker 1: Tiny little tanks.

808
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:29,030
Speaker 1: Yeah let's see you hit me every time no matter what when it's like a thousand.

809
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:29,773
Speaker 0: It's like alright.

810
00:48:29,793 --> 00:48:32,830
Speaker 0: I'm saving up for the Merv and I'm sending it over to Scott's comments.

811
00:48:32,991 --> 00:48:34,949
Speaker 1: I gotta use a funky Merv to have a chance.

812
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:35,417
Speaker 0: Yeah.

813
00:48:36,472 --> 00:48:38,990
Speaker 1: I'll bury you in a pile of dirt and I'll fire your funky Merv.

814
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:42,810
Speaker 0: Alright I'm going to dig my way out of the dirt for the next hundred and fifty turns.

815
00:48:43,392 --> 00:48:43,522
Speaker 1: Digger.

816
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:44,428
Speaker 0: Digger.

817
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:45,127
Speaker 0: Digger digger.

818
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:46,466
Speaker 0: Sandhog.

819
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:47,658
Speaker 1: Digger.

820
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:48,461
Speaker 1: Driller.

821
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:51,729
Speaker 0: Digger is a kick that doesn't really work.

822
00:48:51,992 --> 00:48:52,081
Speaker 0: Yeah.

823
00:48:52,351 --> 00:48:53,109
Speaker 0: Driller is the killer.

824
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:53,930
Speaker 1: Driller is the killer.

825
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:54,828
Speaker 0: But.

826
00:48:55,350 --> 00:49:00,164
Speaker 1: So I think like if you took this core game and you just polished it up a bit you know and made the.

827
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:01,109
Speaker 0: Oh you.

828
00:49:01,596 --> 00:49:02,110
Speaker 0: I agree with you.

829
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,169
Speaker 1: Put a different skin on it you know.

830
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:06,730
Speaker 0: Polish this game from a B plus.

831
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,050
Speaker 1: And it would be so choice.

832
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,430
Speaker 0: It would be A plus.

833
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,207
Speaker 0: Like it would be.

834
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:10,906
Speaker 1: I think it's.

835
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:12,589
Speaker 1: I mean I agree with you that it can be.

836
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:17,990
Speaker 1: I don't know if it gets A plus but it could be A. You could get this to A but I think it's at C plus right now.

837
00:49:18,152 --> 00:49:18,650
Speaker 0: I'd say B plus.

838
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,550
Speaker 1: But you can make this A. Easily.

839
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:23,889
Speaker 0: I would say B plus and I think you didn't give it as much credit as it deserves.

840
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,990
Speaker 0: but I do agree to a point of some of the flaws you pointed out.

841
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:27,629
Speaker 1: I think it's just.

842
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:28,310
Speaker 1: I'm very.

843
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,109
Speaker 1: I was like I'm just not willing to deal with that.

844
00:49:30,453 --> 00:49:31,488
Speaker 1: Even small flaws.

845
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,550
Speaker 1: There's so many fucking good games out there.

846
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:34,210
Speaker 1: Why am I going to play.

847
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:37,350
Speaker 1: I mean look at the controls on Nidhogg which is also pixely.

848
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:37,927
Speaker 1: Nidhogg.

849
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,710
Speaker 1: You never get confused about where your Nidhogg dude is.

850
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:41,889
Speaker 0: Except Nidhogg.

851
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,550
Speaker 0: There is a deep flaw.

852
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,769
Speaker 0: Once I. Like I tried to.

853
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:45,910
Speaker 1: I'm not saying Nidhogg isn't flawed.

854
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:46,309
Speaker 1: I'm saying.

855
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:47,530
Speaker 1: Controls wise.

856
00:49:48,012 --> 00:49:48,161
Speaker 1: It is.

857
00:49:49,017 --> 00:49:49,310
Speaker 0: Right?

858
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:50,808
Speaker 0: You don't think so?

859
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,049
Speaker 0: Actually I have.

860
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:56,470
Speaker 0: Having played it to the point that I got like really good at it.

861
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:04,250
Speaker 0: I ran into a problem where the disarmments mechanics of moving the sword up and down to disarm are bullshit.

862
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,050
Speaker 0: They are very counterintuitive.

863
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:12,870
Speaker 0: How it actually works frame wise is not what you think and it's.

864
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,870
Speaker 1: Isn't it just you move your sword up into the other person's sword and they lose it?

865
00:50:16,073 --> 00:50:16,830
Speaker 0: Not quite.

866
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:17,185
Speaker 0: No.

867
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:24,510
Speaker 0: And I basically found that if I use a game pad like a gaming stick like my street fighter stick and I just go apeshit up and down while I'm moving around.

868
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:27,169
Speaker 0: That'll beat any amount of skill.

869
00:50:28,152 --> 00:50:31,510
Speaker 1: Or what if they just you know come at you from behind or above or whatever.

870
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:32,396
Speaker 0: Well that's a whole different thing.

871
00:50:32,436 --> 00:50:38,926
Speaker 0: but there's some of the maps where you have to have the sword duel and that part of the game is broken.

872
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:41,229
Speaker 0: Broken and shit.

873
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,768
Speaker 1: But I'm saying the controls work.

874
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:43,969
Speaker 0: Yeah but the controls.

875
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:48,122
Speaker 1: I can always use Mario 3 or Super Metroid if I have to talk about perfect controls too right?

876
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,049
Speaker 1: So it's like.

877
00:50:49,730 --> 00:51:00,690
Speaker 0: It's so weird that Mario 3 to this day probably like Mario 3 and Super Meat Boy probably have the tightest controls in a platformer the world has ever seen.

878
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:05,930
Speaker 1: The other thing I would like to see to make Tower Fall a bit better is just make the game bigger right?

879
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:06,990
Speaker 1: If you're on this cramped.

880
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,370
Speaker 1: I know the cramped thing adds to the hecticness and stuff which is what the game is about.

881
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:15,630
Speaker 1: but make a big map where people start farther apart sort of like Bomberman where you get some warm up before you get in with each other.

882
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:16,750
Speaker 0: I would make that an option.

883
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:23,906
Speaker 1: Right so you can maybe get an item learn how to use it and then now you're encountering people and you can sort of you know think about what you're gonna do.

884
00:51:23,946 --> 00:51:26,278
Speaker 1: before you do it you got time to figure out where you are.

885
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:27,041
Speaker 1: you got all you know.

886
00:51:27,322 --> 00:51:33,729
Speaker 1: that would go a long way towards making the game like you know Bomberman level of good but it's like instead I'll just play Bomberman.

887
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:37,541
Speaker 0: Yeah but in terms of you know the tightness.

888
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:40,306
Speaker 0: one thing the game does very well is the default mode.

889
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:41,169
Speaker 1: I'm in a bomb mood.

890
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:46,670
Speaker 0: It goes until the last man standing and you get a point for each kill you got.

891
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,490
Speaker 1: Yeah that's actually a good thing I think.

892
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,449
Speaker 0: Yeah the way that independent the game is like.

893
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:53,385
Speaker 1: Because otherwise you get the Smash Brothers problem where it's like.

894
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:57,623
Speaker 1: yeah it's like at one hand when you're playing for kills the way Towerfall does.

895
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:03,030
Speaker 1: sometimes it can be frustrating because it's like I survived I didn't get killed but I didn't kill anyone and I'm losing.

896
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:06,326
Speaker 0: At the same time if you didn't get killed and you didn't kill anyone what the fuck were you doing?

897
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,400
Speaker 1: Exactly that you're punished and I you know.

898
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,440
Speaker 1: at the one hand that's frustrating when that happens to you even if you were trying to get kills.

899
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:23,369
Speaker 1: but it really is the better choice versus the stock play where you get the rim who hides and doesn't do anything and just defense you know just prevents themselves from dying without actually putting themselves at risk.

900
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:25,030
Speaker 0: Which is also what I do in Narwhal.

901
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:33,853
Speaker 1: Everyone has to go out there and try to kill people right in order to have a chance of winning which means everyone also puts themselves at risk of being killed and action actually happens.

902
00:52:34,215 --> 00:52:36,789
Speaker 1: but also the kill mode is the right way for it to be.

903
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:51,250
Speaker 0: I think this is far superior to the way pros play Smash Brothers with the timed attack because I and I'm not the I have a lot of people I think find the like two minute or five minute smash most kills wins just really unsatisfying to play.

904
00:52:51,531 --> 00:53:00,850
Speaker 1: Well it's also because in Smash it's like you keep your health between kills so you sort of get a little bit right whereas I think with this it's you know it's a one hit kill.

905
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:04,528
Speaker 1: so you know as soon as the other person spawns you're on even footing right away.

906
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:05,271
Speaker 1: you know you.

907
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:10,763
Speaker 1: if you're better you could just get kill kill kill kill kill and Smash Brothers will be back and forth back and forth back and forth.

908
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,910
Speaker 1: there'll be a timing issue.

909
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:19,506
Speaker 0: But also there's something visceral about killing everyone like in Smash Brothers like when you are the like you kill someone and they lose a life.

910
00:53:19,566 --> 00:53:20,450
Speaker 0: that's a big deal.

911
00:53:21,013 --> 00:53:27,669
Speaker 0: But when you're playing the time attack even though you're getting a point and the point is what matters to actually win the tournament it's not nearly as satisfied.

912
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:35,450
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if Towerfall has this mode because they didn't explore all the modes but another good way to balance this out is to say the winner is the person who gets the most kills.

913
00:53:36,072 --> 00:53:37,957
Speaker 1: but we keep playing.

914
00:53:37,977 --> 00:53:42,410
Speaker 1: the game ends when there's only one survivor and everyone has ten lives.

915
00:53:42,611 --> 00:53:45,863
Speaker 1: so as opposed to timing the round right you're using stocks.

916
00:53:46,345 --> 00:53:49,215
Speaker 1: but the stocks don't determine who's winning.

917
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:50,202
Speaker 1: right you can be.

918
00:53:50,282 --> 00:53:51,510
Speaker 1: you can lose all your lives.

919
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,870
Speaker 0: Yeah they basically determine how long you've got to kill.

920
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,823
Speaker 1: You can be the first person to die five times and still win.

921
00:53:56,843 --> 00:54:02,206
Speaker 1: if you if you gave everyone else four deaths before you lost your five you now have 12 points.

922
00:54:02,266 --> 00:54:03,995
Speaker 1: no one can conceivably catch up to that.

923
00:54:04,337 --> 00:54:08,520
Speaker 1: you know even though they're all still playing and you're going to get a drink of water and taking a leak right.

924
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,988
Speaker 1: so you can combine both modes.

925
00:54:10,008 --> 00:54:12,278
Speaker 1: I don't know if Towerfall allows that it has so many modes.

926
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:15,676
Speaker 1: it just might but use stock to control the when the game ends.

927
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:17,349
Speaker 1: use kills to determine who wins.

928
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:31,497
Speaker 0: But in the end like I would say if you have people who hang out at your house at parties and you want to play a local competitive game on one screen with four controllers just put turn this on and leave it running.

929
00:54:31,537 --> 00:54:35,436
Speaker 1: there's not a lot of other choices besides the ones I've mentioned like Bomberman and stuff.

930
00:54:35,456 --> 00:54:38,907
Speaker 1: so WarioWare right this Starwall.

931
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:45,529
Speaker 1: so even though I'm giving this one you know a C C+ but potential for A+ if they improve it right or not.

932
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,017
Speaker 1: well A at least no I don't know if I give you A+.

933
00:54:47,057 --> 00:54:50,395
Speaker 0: oh yeah if there's a Towerfall 2 I'll probably pre-order that shit.

934
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:54,758
Speaker 1: yeah that could a Towerfall 2 where they polished those things that could be A but oh I.

935
00:54:54,778 --> 00:54:55,963
Speaker 0: just so I just noticed something.

936
00:54:55,983 --> 00:54:56,988
Speaker 0: I pulled up the Wikipedia.

937
00:54:57,008 --> 00:54:59,279
Speaker 1: this still isn't a bad choice because there's not a lot of competition.

938
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,365
Speaker 0: quote Thorson.

939
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:06,868
Speaker 0: so the guys it's mechanics were inspired by games of Thorson's use such as Bushido Blade one shot kill.

940
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:10,603
Speaker 0: yeah yeah all right I do like that's it that Bushido Blade?

941
00:55:10,824 --> 00:55:12,974
Speaker 0: it's very rare that I can reference Bushido Blade.

942
00:55:13,316 --> 00:55:14,342
Speaker 1: sure I mean one shot kills.

943
00:55:14,362 --> 00:55:15,066
Speaker 1: what are you gonna reference?

944
00:55:15,086 --> 00:55:16,332
Speaker 1: Bushido Blade and Rainbow Six.

945
00:55:16,352 --> 00:55:19,019
Speaker 1: those are the one shot kill games.

946
00:55:20,564 --> 00:55:29,256
Speaker 0: so if you're gonna play one of those games buy this before you buy Brawlhalla because Brawlhalla is garbage is just a Smash Brothers like knockoff.

947
00:55:29,477 --> 00:55:31,125
Speaker 1: it's not as nearly as good as Smash Brothers.

948
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:38,308
Speaker 1: you may as well just play Smash Brothers but if you're gonna do Bomberman before you get this and get a good Bomberman there's a lot of good Bomberman's out there.

949
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,791

Speaker 0: I worry if people keep adding pledges above the five dollar level that I might have trouble with this list down the road but I digress.

960
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,240
Speaker 0: The holidays are coming up so like we said there might not be as many episodes as usual.

961
00:57:34,361 --> 00:57:41,331
Speaker 0: Geek Nights might slow down a little bit but the production all that other stuff as you may have seen in the Patreon updates are continuing.

962
00:57:41,752 --> 00:57:50,016
Speaker 0: so expect some Rims-Rans some special Rim and Emily episodes maybe some Utena pre-production process stuff and more.

963
00:57:50,277 --> 00:57:51,320
Speaker 0: all this can be yours.

964
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:51,781
Speaker 0: also.

965
00:57:51,801 --> 00:58:04,865
Speaker 0: I will probably finish Undertale for real and get the supposedly true ultra pacifist amazing ending that I'm supposed to get because I didn't kill the flower guy even though I probably should have.

966
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:06,651
Speaker 0: and now I leave you now.

967
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:19,491
Speaker 0: normally I say your moment of literally the opposite of zen but I've actually found something pretty horrifying and I don't apologize because I'm actually really happy that you're gonna have to listen to this.

968
00:58:19,632 --> 00:58:21,460
Speaker 0: but enjoy.

969
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,409
Speaker 1: She's rapping, little red, a-rapping hood.

970
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:47,620
Speaker 1: She's rapping, little red, a-rapping hood.

971
00:58:48,102 --> 00:58:51,420
Speaker 1: Little red, little red, feeling red, feeling red.

972
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:55,964
Speaker 0: Well she skipped off to Granny's with a basket of bread but when she got to G's house she saw the wolf instead.

973
00:58:56,004 --> 00:59:00,145
Speaker 0: she said "I've seen you some place before and never forget to finish that one like yours".

974
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:02,339
Speaker 1: she said "Come on what big arms you have".

975
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,730
Speaker 1: "All the arms I see you with".

976
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,780
Speaker 1: "My big ears you have".

977
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:11,631
Speaker 1: She's rapping, little red, a-rapping hood.

978
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:14,058
Speaker 0: She's rapping, little red, a-rapping hood.

00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:34,740
Speaker 1: Fun and dancing are the first requisition.

985
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:39,480
Speaker 0: Music in the key, a piece in harmony The world all together and that's the way it has to be.

986
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:41,810
Speaker 0: Moving to the beat, yellow shoes on his feet.

987
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:44,020
Speaker 0: When he's on the microphone he gets you off your seat.

988
00:59:44,461 --> 00:59:46,530
