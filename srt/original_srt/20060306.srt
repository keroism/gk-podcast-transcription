1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,710
Speaker 2: It's Monday March 6th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,835
Speaker 2: We talk about how not to suck at podcasting.

3
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:16,340
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:21,840
Speaker 0: So we're back after a long weekend of geek a long weekend of not enough sleep.

5
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:26,499
Speaker 0: Yeah What was originally gonna be two friends driving up from North Carolina to hang out?

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:37,280
Speaker 1: ended up as all of our friends come over our house and trashing it and We didn't even get to do that much stuff because we spent a lot of time in transport and sleep and eat.

7
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:41,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah the best part was how I lost my cell phone in Manhattan.

8
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:48,480
Speaker 0: good job, yeah Well, actually I found out later that I lost it on the train to Manhattan and I love technology.

9
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:54,702
Speaker 0: So I lost my cell phone right and I keep trying to call my cell phone on someone else's cell phone all day And it doesn't answer.

10
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:58,974
Speaker 0: and then my Scott here gets an email or an instant message, right?

11
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:00,518
Speaker 1: Oh, is this a message?

12
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:12,380
Speaker 0: Yeah So and then Scott says oh it's uh this guy aim him here and he aims me and he's like, hey I got your cell phone And I offered to give him some money and he offered to mail it to me and I should have it tomorrow.

13
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:16,619
Speaker 0: So once again New Yorkers are awesome, and they're not as evil as all you.

14
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:18,908
Speaker 0: Now New Yorkers seem to think they are.

15
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:21,740
Speaker 1: of course, you're still pretty crummy for losing that cell phone.

16
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:22,825
Speaker 0: What do you want?

17
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:24,391
Speaker 0: I had it on a belt clip under a trench coat.

18
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:26,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I used to lose shit all the time.

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,471
Speaker 1: I can't tell you how many Timex watches I've lost.

20
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:30,180
Speaker 0: I haven't lost my wallet since middle school.

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,862
Speaker 0: I'm proud of that.

22
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:35,375
Speaker 1: I lost a wallet like freshman year of college sophomore year.

23
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:35,957
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

24
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:38,448
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter I haven't lost anything since then.

25
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:40,700
Speaker 1: so I haven't lost anything like four years before that.

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:48,115
Speaker 0: I used to lose shit all the time, but the dude who found my cell phone when I was offering, you know Hey, I'll give him some money whatever since you know, I do geek nights.

27
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:52,952
Speaker 0: I offered him Hey, if you have a website or anything you want to promote I'll help you out.

28
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:57,785
Speaker 0: and his response to that was well, actually Well, what does he want to promote?

29
00:01:57,926 --> 00:02:05,579
Speaker 0: I don't know if any of you out there actually live in Tarrytown, New York It's a one of the burbs kind of of New York City or if you know anyone who does.

30
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:15,600

54
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:12,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the expected joke.

55
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:13,685
Speaker 0: Awesome.

56
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:18,515
Speaker 1: Yeah alright, so I don't know if you realize.

57
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:21,299
Speaker 1: but Firefox how much does Firefox cost?

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,791
Speaker 1: Nothing, how much money does Mozilla make from Firefox?

59
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,660
Speaker 0: I would assume nothing you assume wrong?

60
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,309
Speaker 1: Oh, let's start a guessing game ready.

61
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,433
Speaker 1: make a guess.

62
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,199
Speaker 0: All right, how many dollars?

63
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:34,440
Speaker 1: what?

64
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,168
Speaker 0: All right, it's either gonna be real low or real high.

65
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:45,539
Speaker 1: Well, this is how much money Mozilla has made from Firefox ever as in as long as Firefox has existed ever.

66
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:53,478
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm a million dollars higher a billion dollars lower.

67
00:03:53,498 --> 00:04:03,539
Speaker 0: a million dollars and a dollar 72 million dollars, that's about 72 million more than I expected, right?

68
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,997
Speaker 1: So You know where this money comes from?

69
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:07,905
Speaker 1: It's kind of crazy.

70
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,435
Speaker 1: All right in the top right of Firefox.

71
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,759
Speaker 1: You'll notice that little searchy box.

72
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:13,666
Speaker 0: Do people pay to be there?

73
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:17,820
Speaker 1: No, no, no, you notice how Google is the default for that searchy box.

74
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:30,465
Speaker 1: all right, if I make a Google search in that searchy box, and then I get to let's say I search for I don't know fire which is my favorite Google search And I know he's not kidding.

75
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:31,991
Speaker 0: He searches for it fairly regularly.

76
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,738
Speaker 1: All right, so let's actually do it.

77
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,525
Speaker 1: right now Let's go to the searchy box in Firefox and type in Fire press.

78
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:41,035
Speaker 1: enter on the right side of this page.

79
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:46,091
Speaker 1: There's an advertisement for fire Planning a career in firefighting.

80
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:47,400
Speaker 1: explore the possibilities.

81
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,486
Speaker 1: Www.collegeboard.com.

82
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:50,829
Speaker 0: Is there anyone selling fire?

83
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:54,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's actually a whole bunch of paid for links on the side of this page.

84
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,939
Speaker 1: There's one two, three, four, five six eight eight sponsored links on the side of this page.

85
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:03,300
Speaker 1: Outstanding if I click one of these links, right?

86
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:09,780
Speaker 1: That means that the person who paid for that advertisement gives money to Google for that ad.

87
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:14,794
Speaker 1: For you know, the impression or the click or whatever does Mozilla get a cut.

88
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:23,280
Speaker 1: if I click on this link Then 80% of the money that that advertiser gives to Google actually goes to Mozilla.

89
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:29,679
Speaker 0: I did not know that and I never would have guessed that This is only for the paid links on the side, of course.

90
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:35,716
Speaker 1: However, you know over time that has amounted to 72 million dollars.

91
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:40,034
Speaker 0: surprisingly when I search for a product I have more than once clicked on one of those links to get what I wanted.

92
00:05:40,436 --> 00:05:41,099
Speaker 1: I click on them.

93
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:42,442
Speaker 1: You know what?

94
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:55,991
Speaker 1: You usually happens when I'm looking to buy something like but when I'm looking for information I never click there, but I'm looking to buy a product and what will happen is usually like a specialized online Store will appear over there and that's what I want.

95
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:56,614
Speaker 1: That's useful.

96
00:05:56,674 --> 00:05:57,076
Speaker 1: I don't care.

97
00:05:57,096 --> 00:06:04,766
Speaker 1: if it's an ad it's the link I want you know, and if it saves me going to the 10th page to click where no one gets any money for the same Link, it's just stupid course.

98
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:08,480
Speaker 0: Sometimes I'll search for mesothelioma and click on all the links to cost evil people money.

99
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:10,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, that works.

100
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,139
Speaker 0: I urge all of you to search for mesothelioma and click on all the links.

101
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,910
Speaker 1: Maybe we should do a show on mesothelioma.

102
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,175
Speaker 1: And what's the other one?

103
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:21,647
Speaker 1: Uh, What is the other one begins with like a P?

104
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:23,413
Speaker 0: I don't know.

105
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know either.

106
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,279
Speaker 1: I forgot it used to get posted to my site all the time.

107
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:35,543
Speaker 0: so I'm sure a lot of you have seen that AOL has opened up the AIM instant messaging SDK.

108
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:41,018
Speaker 1: finally I can freaking get a client besides the aim client and send files reliably to my friends.

109
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:44,329
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, you'd think that now the headline seems great.

110
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:44,730
Speaker 0: All right.

111
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,234
Speaker 0: Now there's an official SDK.

112
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,020
Speaker 0: I can officially interface with aim.

113
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,624
Speaker 0: It'll be great.

114
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:49,993
Speaker 0: It won't be a hack.

115
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,928
Speaker 0: It won't be reverse engineered Upon further reading.

116
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,014
Speaker 0: it's bullshit.

117
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,080
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

118
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,863
Speaker 1: How could it be bullshit?

119
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,273
Speaker 1: They give you software that allows you to interface with aim, right?

120
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,840
Speaker 0: All right, they give you the software.

121
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:06,339
Speaker 0: However, there are a number of restrictions as to what you can actually do with that software.

122
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:10,134
Speaker 1: now Are these license on paper restrictions or physical software?

123
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:14,190
Speaker 0: restrictions are license on paper You'll go to jail as opposed to physical.

124
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,680
Speaker 1: You can just get around so I could just take the SDK and do it.

125
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,938
Speaker 0: Anyway, you could but you get in trouble.

126
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:24,298
Speaker 1: Is there like some sort of key system where they know like Google has with their SDKs?

127
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:24,880
Speaker 0: I don't know.

128
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,844
Speaker 0: I didn't look too much into it.

129
00:07:25,964 --> 00:07:27,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd be interesting to know.

130
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:29,820
Speaker 1: cuz if there is then you really couldn't disobey the license.

131
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, the gist of it is that for one you can use this for whatever you want any non-commercial purposes, but you cannot one.

132
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:45,929
Speaker 0: You create a client or use the SDK with a client that is quote multi-headed Meaning it can connect to more than one type of network.

133
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:47,013
Speaker 1: What the hell.

134
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:48,438
Speaker 1: that's all defeats the whole purpose.

135
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:49,140
Speaker 1: No one's gonna use it.

136
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,124
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

137
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:51,389
Speaker 1: that's like if GM used it.

138
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,980
Speaker 0: They'd have to drop support for I don't know everything.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, there goes that - if you're going to use it on any sort of wireless device like a PDA or a cell phone up.

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,008
Speaker 0: Nope, you have to get a separate pay license.

141
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,376
Speaker 1: Oh, see that's the freaking scam.

142
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,080
Speaker 1: I hate the worst.

143
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,259
Speaker 1: Oh my that's almost as bad as the first one.

144
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:15,113
Speaker 1: Oh trying to get aimed to work on anything cuz I have a Blackberry right and there's no reason that this Blackberry piece of hardware Could not be a really really good.

145
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:16,240
Speaker 1: I am client, right?

146
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,960
Speaker 1: The problem is if all the software that makes it be an I am client costs a lot of money.

147
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:27,400
Speaker 1: And the only reason that costs a lot of money is because like this crazy vendor lock-in bullshit.

148
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:31,574
Speaker 0: Yeah so this won't solve that because you can't use the code if you're gonna do anything like that.

149
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:36,611
Speaker 0: such bastard number three if You want to make something for any sort of corporate use at all?

150
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:38,480
Speaker 0: No, you have to pay for that separately, too.

151
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,073
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I aim doesn't want you competing with their aim corporate products.

152
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:46,579
Speaker 1: that makes corporate products are terrible I know but at least it makes a little more sense than the first two.

153
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:48,119
Speaker 0: Well the first two look at the first one.

154
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:52,439
Speaker 0: They don't want people to be able to connect to multiple networks because then why do they need AOL?

155
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,369
Speaker 1: Mmm, because they're still using AOL.

156
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:57,000
Speaker 1: They're just also using other things.

157
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,573
Speaker 0: Honestly, the only reason I use AOL is because some of my idiot friends won't give it up.

158
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:01,175
Speaker 0: Yeah.

159
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,369
Speaker 1: Yeah use jabber Jabber jabber jabber jabber.

160
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:05,599
Speaker 1: I'll do a show on jabber one time.

161
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,268
Speaker 0: I'm getting evil looks from our guest who is not.

162
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:14,558
Speaker 0: her microphone is turned off currently and it'll be turned on the second half of the show And she uses aim.

163
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:32,181
Speaker 1: I Don't know how old-school all the listeners be but When I had a computer it ran DOS and Windows 3.1.

164
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:38,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, like DOS as in there's no such thing as networking and there's no such thing as um a gooey.

165
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,329
Speaker 0: Well, I guess you could use das shell 32 bits.

166
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:47,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, Windows 3 1 1 and Really you only have two mouse buttons that do anything.

167
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,680
Speaker 1: the third one just kind of does nothing unless you're playing a game.

168
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:59,291
Speaker 0: in Windows 3 1 1 you could minimize your whole computer and then you couldn't do anything and When you exited Windows you went to DOS instead of turning your computer off.

169
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:00,013
Speaker 0: Yeah.

170
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:01,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was fantastic.

171
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:02,480
Speaker 0: Those were awesome days.

172
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:08,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, um, some people still use Windows 3.1 and I don't blame What.

173
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:10,958
Speaker 1: oh, well, you don't use it as your primary OS.

174
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:15,016
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, but some people still use it because you got to play those old Windows 3.1 game.

175
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,881
Speaker 0: Well, I'll know to you that OS to warp kick the shit out of Windows 3 1.

176
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,797
Speaker 1: Actually, I had OS to warp and Windows 3.1.

177
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:24,400
Speaker 0: I still have it.

178
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:31,287
Speaker 0: In fact, I have the installers for it for the most current version that you guys can't get right now About 15 feet away from me in the closet

179
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:32,250
Speaker 1: and I work

180
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,996
Speaker 0: for IBM and we still use OS

181
00:10:33,996 --> 00:10:42,011
Speaker 1: 2 and I had DOS All on the same computer and OS 2 war worked pretty well and had some fancy stuff But it didn't have any soft software that was useful.

182
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:43,517
Speaker 0: Oh, it was very robust.

183
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:44,360
Speaker 0: It was good for servers.

184
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,936
Speaker 1: So I always ended up dual booting and going back to you know, DOS windows to You know play DOS games.

185
00:10:51,036 --> 00:11:05,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway anyway somebody Awesome made this thing called Cal Myra c a l m i r a. it's Cal Myra XP 4.0.

186
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,060
Speaker 1: Calmyra XP 4.0 is something you can download.

187
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:17,974
Speaker 1: Put it on your windows 3.1 computer and it makes your windows 3.1 computer Look and function as if it was Windows XP.

188
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,440
Speaker 0: now Scott showed this to me.

189
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,657
Speaker 0: He just showed me a screenshot and asked what's what's up with this picture?

190
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:23,260
Speaker 0: and I looked at it.

191
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,600
Speaker 0: It was Windows XP with maybe a little skin to it and I couldn't figure it out.

192
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,820
Speaker 1: It looks exactly like Windows XP and there's even a start menu and in everything and it's really scary.

193
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,765
Speaker 1: But this computer is actually Windows 3.1.

194
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:36,628
Speaker 1: Now.

195
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:46,016
Speaker 1: It's an actual old slow computer - you know, they don't say that I have a feeling they're running Windows 3.1 on DOS box or something.

196
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:47,220
Speaker 0: That would make sense.

197
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:50,816
Speaker 0: I mean not many people have 486 is kicking around that still work.

198
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,516
Speaker 1: Well Yeah, it's the only explanation I can come up with for it.

199
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:59,917
Speaker 1: But I Just got to say Windows 3.1 like back in the day.

200
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:03,040
Speaker 1: It was great But if you try to use it now, you just want to kill yourself.

201
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,427
Speaker 1: I mean They don't even have the X button on the windows.

202
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:16,560
Speaker 1: you had to double click in that in the top left and the little menu That was like my shape kind of thing Yeah, and like you couldn't really and you had to use the program manager for everything.

203
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:36,032
Speaker 1: So like the desktop was always hidden behind the program manager, but the icons on the desktop you wanted to use and uh Yeah, yeah, so that's why in Windows 95 the the program manager was still there but it was hidden and they gave you the start menu instead and that's what it was all about, but Yes, and now this makes Windows 3.1 real usable.

204
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:41,860
Speaker 1: So you can get a computer and load it up with a pile of Windows 3.1 games and you're good to go.

205
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,176
Speaker 0: It's actually if you have a really old slow computer a lot of new Linux's.

206
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:51,639
Speaker 0: you can do stuff with them But Windows 3.1 actually is pretty robust for how little it is and how weak it is.

207
00:12:52,234 --> 00:13:00,824
Speaker 1: Yeah The difference is if you install an old Linux or a Linux designed to run an old computer like Ubuntu lite or something like that You can run Firefox.

208
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:06,560
Speaker 1: if you decide you want to run wizards 3.1 on your old computer you have to run Netscape 2 gold.

209
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,121
Speaker 0: Hey, at least you get Netscape 2.

210
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,145
Speaker 1: You're really badass.

211
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,838
Speaker 1: You can get Netscape 3 gold or Netscape 4 point Netscape.

212
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:17,130
Speaker 0: Whatever Yeah, that one the point at which I switch to IE.

213
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:17,913
Speaker 1: Yep.

214
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:19,980
Speaker 1: I have a Windows Netscape communicator CD.

215
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,965
Speaker 1: God you want it?

216
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:23,070
Speaker 0: No sure.

217
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:25,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can run it in wine.

218
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:28,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, that's really what I want to spend a weekend doing.

219
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:32,840
Speaker 1: It might be better than running Windows 3.1.

220
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:45,332
Speaker 0: Alright, so I had one thing of the day, but I saw a new thing just before the show and Since the rule of the thing of the day is that I have to use the coolest thing I've seen on the interwebs since the last time I did a show.

221
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:46,918
Speaker 0: I have to use this now.

222
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:50,539
Speaker 0: You're all familiar with fight club and fight clubs.

223
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,612
Speaker 0: Scott here was actually accused of being a member of it's not accused.

224
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:59,342
Speaker 1: I was you were questioned one level below Suspected.

225
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:04,240
Speaker 0: so I asked you if an injury you would sustain was due to your participation in a fight club.

226
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:05,145
Speaker 1: That is correct.

227
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,573
Speaker 0: They use the words fight club.

228
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,076
Speaker 0: Did they not?

229
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:07,840
Speaker 1: that is correct?

230
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,558
Speaker 0: I find this hilarious because for any of you who actually know Scott he is weaker than a puppy.

231
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:14,927
Speaker 1: I'm not weaker than a puppy.

232
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,896
Speaker 1: I could kill a puppy if I wanted to.

233
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:18,960
Speaker 0: I don't know.

234
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,672
Speaker 0: I think a puppy could just worry you to death.

235
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:21,840
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

236
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:26,392
Speaker 1: I mean if it was a wolf puppy It might bite me and claw me and it wouldn't be happy.

237
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:28,100
Speaker 1: and then maybe the big wolf would come and eat me.

238
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:37,599
Speaker 1: but if it was like You know one of those little weird tiny dogs that are all scarily small if it was like a puppy one of those Then it really wouldn't have much to do.

239
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:44,491
Speaker 0: So anyway, this is a fight club and they have videos of their fights.

240
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:49,551
Speaker 0: now you might wonder why would rim link to just a fight Club, he's not into fighting.

241
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:54,431
Speaker 0: Well, uh This is a nerd fight club and you have to see it to believe it.

242
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,400
Speaker 0: Imagine nerds hitting each other with plastic knives.

243
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:07,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, like two nerds put on little like safety helmets and there's like an officiator and stuff to make sure no one gets hurt And whatnot and they just go at each other with plastic knives.

244
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,679
Speaker 1: It's kind of it's like wow, these nerds don't get out.

245
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,639
Speaker 0: Wow, hey, they're getting out more than some other nerds true, but not enough.

246
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:24,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, one foot out of the closet ain't - All right, anyway.

247
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:27,460
Speaker 0: So today we were debating we were gonna do a themed week this week.

248
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:37,044
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll still do one depending on today, but today's gonna be another one of those how not to suck days how not to suck at Podcasting.

249
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,673
Speaker 1: now at least the technical.

250
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:50,271
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not gonna talk about you know the like coming up with an idea or learning how to not say um like That's up to you.

251
00:15:50,473 --> 00:16:03,256
Speaker 0: so yeah But just the very basics of one how to make your podcast not sound like an ass To how to use a microphone in a somewhat proper manner, you know all that sort of stuff.

252
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:07,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not like You know the gods of radio or anything.

253
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:09,866
Speaker 1: No, but our podcast.

254
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:18,260
Speaker 1: I know from listening to a lot of podcast including ours that like Some podcasts they have some noise in the background and that's sometimes tolerable.

255
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:22,300
Speaker 1: You know some of them the interview parts or when they have someone on the phone, it's staticky.

256
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:25,114
Speaker 1: That's tolerable because even real radio stations have that.

257
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:26,180
Speaker 1: there's nothing you can do about it.

258
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,205
Speaker 0: Well, I'm talking about like.

259
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:30,220
Speaker 1: I'm talking about you podcasters who are so amateur.

260
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:54,397
Speaker 1: I mean it's okay to be amateur But when you like the volume is in audible or when one guy on the show is Incredibly loud and the other guy is so quiet and I have to keep adjusting my volume as you both talk And I can't hear or when I have to turn the volume in my car up so high that when the next Podcast comes on that's made by someone who knows what they're doing It freaking kills my eardrums and I have to turn it all the way back down.

261
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:57,677
Speaker 0: now We've got two respecters on this because like I said earlier we have a guest.

262
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:04,440
Speaker 0: now We have here a friend of ours who has been laughing hysterically at how we actually do this podcast off mic.

263
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:06,267
Speaker 0: But now she's got a mic in our hand.

264
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:07,551
Speaker 0: So we've got Nuri here.

265
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:09,720
Speaker 0: So you do a podcast I hear.

266
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,179
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do a podcast about geeky art stuff.

267
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:14,063
Speaker 0: What's it called?

268
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:15,810
Speaker 2: Oh, it's called artist alley.

269
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,573
Speaker 2: all one word.

270
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:18,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you know, you're getting a link.

271
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:19,608
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess so.

272
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,979
Speaker 2: I guess I'll be linked in the show notes.

273
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:27,807
Speaker 1: Tell people the URL if it cuz if they're schmucks and they don't visit the people who don't visit the website Okay.

274
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:36,015
Speaker 2: Well the URL is www.candycornstudios.com And the easiest way to get to it is to just click on the podcast link.

275
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:40,138
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, and Andy corn if you don't know what candy corn is.

276
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,985
Speaker 0: Well You can go to hell.

277
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,472
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a good story behind that.

278
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:45,240
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll let you know on Halloween.

279
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:46,324
Speaker 2: Yeah, there is.

280
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:49,176
Speaker 2: I don't know if you guys ever listen to Lewis black.

281
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:49,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do.

282
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:58,051
Speaker 0: I know that I know the bit about Your body the yellow part thinking it'll taste like corn, but it doesn't.

283
00:17:58,372 --> 00:17:59,535
Speaker 0: it tastes like ass.

284
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,120
Speaker 1: then you eat another one you fuck.

285
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:04,164
Speaker 2: Another detailed story.

286
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:05,449
Speaker 2: you can come talk to me on the website.

287
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:08,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically we've got her here.

288
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:14,140
Speaker 0: one because She came up for the weekend from North Carolina to hang out in New York City, which she had never been to.

289
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:23,060
Speaker 0: We've got two basic perspectives here on how to make your podcast not suck.

290
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,458
Speaker 0: We're gonna have the low-budget version and the no-budget version.

291
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:30,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, not for any bad reason.

292
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,080
Speaker 0: just she's still in college and we're out of college.

293
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,585
Speaker 1: Now the reason we've left out the high-budget version is because if you have a high budget You don't need to know shit.

294
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:39,589
Speaker 1: you bought stuff.

295
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, you hired a radio guy or who knows.

296
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:44,499
Speaker 0: any problem You have with audio can be solved by spending money.

297
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:52,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're gonna talk about how to do it without spending money, which is key because I'm sorry I'd like to listen to podcasts, but most of you out there just don't know how to do this.

298
00:18:53,681 --> 00:19:02,195
Speaker 1: Even it's some like some of you the content is bad, but some of you just despite your content Which I want to listen to I just can't.

299
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:02,919
Speaker 1: it's just.

300
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:11,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were actually watching Nury earlier on her little Mac laptop working on trying to edit one of her previous podcasts.

301
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:13,940
Speaker 2: Well, it's not actually that easy on a Mac.

302
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:19,480
Speaker 2: I my my computer does not have a microphone input or anything like that.

303
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,756
Speaker 2: So I had to get all this crap to hook up something in there so we could it would record.

304
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:28,219
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I bought a bunch of equipment, but I have more money.

305
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:34,529
Speaker 0: But I guess the the nice perspective here is consider this she spent pretty much no money other than you know Like minimal minimal things.

306
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,079
Speaker 2: Well, I got some stuff for free, too.

307
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,792
Speaker 0: Yeah, that always helps but you can always get stuff for free.

308
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:42,980
Speaker 0: if you can't get anything at all for free You might not have and you can't afford to buy anything.

309
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:51,120
Speaker 1: You might not have the resources to do a podcast just yet You might not have any friends and if you don't have any friends That means no one likes to listen to you, which means you probably shouldn't make a podcast.

310
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,460
Speaker 0: But basically we've spent Scott and I not counting hosting because actually our hosting hosts a lot more than just geek nights.

311
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:01,633
Speaker 0: We spent less than $200 and that includes everything.

312
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:05,512
Speaker 0: Yep, Nuria spent.

313
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:06,157
Speaker 0: how much have you spent?

314
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:11,333
Speaker 0: Total based on all the podcast stuff that you bought.

315
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:12,600
Speaker 0: that is for the podcast.

316
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,860
Speaker 2: Okay, I spent $40 on the little adapter thingy to connect things to my computer which you out there and probably won't need.

317
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,896
Speaker 2: Yeah, unless you have a Mac laptop.

318
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:31,740
Speaker 2: in which case Well, at least if you have a Mac laptop you get the garage band The built-in microphone on the lap Matt the the laptops.

319
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,859
Speaker 2: They sound like ass when you record with them.

320
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:36,846
Speaker 0: Well, actually that's the first thing we can talk about.

321
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:39,455
Speaker 0: if your microphone came with your sound card.

322
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,145
Speaker 0: You can't podcast with it It'll sound like ass.

323
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:45,700
Speaker 0: That's right that that is a universal rule at a minimum.

324
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:50,616
Speaker 1: It seems to me that the lot like the 20 or 30 dollar logitech headset mics.

325
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:51,920
Speaker 1: Those are like the minimum.

326
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:55,740
Speaker 1: They said that's tolerable if you set it up with the right volume and stuff.

327
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:03,717
Speaker 2: Yeah, the microphones that come with the computers tend to pick up so much ambient sound that you just you hear everything else That's going on in the room.

328
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:06,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, now I'd say what we use.

329
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:08,600
Speaker 0: we bought like $20.

330
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,513
Speaker 0: unidirectional RadioShack mics come with little like stands and everything and If you're low budget, those are definitely the way to go.

331
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,157
Speaker 0: They're like 20 or 30 bucks.

332
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:23,584
Speaker 0: If anything if you're not using a headset or especially if there's more than one person in the podcast get a unidirectional Microphone.

333
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:25,115
Speaker 0: if you don't know what that means.

334
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:25,880
Speaker 0: Don't worry about it.

335
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,040
Speaker 0: Just get a unidirectional microphone and point it directly at the person who's talking.

336
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:35,000
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can speak to that because the microphones that I have are not unidirectional.

337
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:49,050
Speaker 2: there's something called cardioid and they pick up sound not just in one direction, but in multiple directions and unfortunately, that means that it picks up all kinds of machine noise and airplanes and people honking on the highway outside and everything.

338
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,890
Speaker 0: I Basically like there's omni-directional microphones which are they'll get everything.

339
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,755
Speaker 0: They're like the whole room.

340
00:21:54,358 --> 00:21:58,822
Speaker 0: any of you who might have found the lost Episodes of geek nights that are floating out there?

341
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:03,229
Speaker 0: before we kind of went live We used a lot of omni-directional microphone in the middle of the room.

342
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:04,654
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was.

343
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:07,490
Speaker 1: that was pretty terrible because that was also one that came with the computer.

344
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,762
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact, I'm sitting next to my computer right now and it even looks cheap.

345
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:13,287
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's two bucks.

346
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:14,129
Speaker 1: It's yet.

347
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,600
Speaker 0: Now there's cardioids.

348
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,929
Speaker 0: There's hyper cardioids.

349
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:18,953
Speaker 0: Basically.

350
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:21,890
Speaker 0: if you don't know anything about audio, this is really gonna be a low-tech.

351
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,270
Speaker 0: We're not gonna tell you like the base details of how all this equipment works because that'll be another show.

352
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:28,035
Speaker 0: This is just how to not suck.

353
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:38,241
Speaker 0: So if you don't know anything about microphones go to RadioShack ask for a cheap unidirectional dynamic microphone And get the RadioShack brand.

354
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,486
Speaker 1: the other brands just cost more.

355
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:40,370
Speaker 1: They're almost the same thing.

356
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,666
Speaker 0: Yeah Like if they have two microphones and they look kind of the same and once $40 and once $20.

357
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,550
Speaker 0: if you don't know the difference You won't notice the difference.

358
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:49,394
Speaker 2: Oh pick them up.

359
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:59,415
Speaker 2: first though pick them up and see if it feels comfortable in your hand because if there's one that's $20 And one that's $30 and the one that's $20 is really heavy and hard to hold and the one that's $30 Feels good in your hand.

360
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:00,498
Speaker 2: It might be worth of 30 bucks

361
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,992
Speaker 0: or by the same token if it feels nice and heavy and solid Yeah,

362
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:08,529
Speaker 1: yeah, but at the same time they might just put weights in there to confuse you

363
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:10,134
Speaker 2: What you like.

364
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:12,826
Speaker 0: actually our old DVD player.

365
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:18,181
Speaker 0: we bought this crap Crapo DVD player and Inside it the apex.

366
00:23:18,422 --> 00:23:27,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, it felt kind of heavy but inside it was this tiny little like poorly soldered circuit board and Something that I'm pretty sure was just a weight to make it feel more sturdy than it was.

367
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:30,298
Speaker 0: I Couldn't figure out a use for it.

368
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,230
Speaker 0: It wasn't any sort of electronic device.

369
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:38,999
Speaker 1: It's like when they sell those little like action figure collectible toys and to make it so you don't know what toy is in Into in each box they put weights.

370
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,245
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the PVCs.

371
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:40,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate that.

372
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,790
Speaker 0: Now while we're talking about microphones.

373
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:50,170
Speaker 0: Consider the difference between me saying Jack Thompson and me saying Jack Thompson.

374
00:23:51,313 --> 00:24:07,080
Speaker 0: Now the latter one probably sounded a lot worse Because if you say P's T's any kind of really hard syllable B and D And yeah air comes out of your mouth and it hits the microphone like so But a pupa pupa pupa pupa pupa pupa.

375
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:15,882
Speaker 2: Okay, air is always coming out of your mouth But on those particular letters it comes out in a really hard fast manner.

376
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:18,210
Speaker 2: that makes a really loud spike in the sound volume.

377
00:24:18,611 --> 00:24:27,870
Speaker 0: Now spikes aren't that bad normally if you have equipment in the way, but unless you're like us I mean we have a compressor which we'll talk about in a minute and we don't have to worry about it so much.

378
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:34,530
Speaker 0: But if you're not gonna spend a lot of money at all You're probably not gonna have a compressor which means you don't want your audio to clip.

379
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:44,759
Speaker 0: basically the best way to make audio sound good is you want to record so that the average volume is as high as you can make it On the like the game the input meter.

380
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,670
Speaker 0: as you're recording this price in whatever program uses some sort of meter You want to be very close to the top of that all the time?

381
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:51,968
Speaker 0: But you never want to hit the top.

382
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,243
Speaker 1: So you want the vine to be as loud as you can go without going off the edge.

383
00:24:56,444 --> 00:25:12,309
Speaker 0: now if you're popping all the time Let you know P's and T's into the microphone you're gonna have these big spikes Which means you're gonna have to set the input gain the volume you record at a lot lower which means your actual signal is gonna be a lot lower and You can say your noise floor is gonna be real high.

384
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:17,050
Speaker 1: Your podcast is gonna sound like ass and that's when you know your podcast is so quiet.

385
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,910
Speaker 1: I have to turn the volume of way up in the car and it pisses me off.

386
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,231
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz.

387
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:22,400
Speaker 0: then you turn it up and you hear all the noise in the background

388
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:32,224
Speaker 2: or you have to be like me and use a Noise-reduction filter and then turn up the vocals and that doesn't necessarily sound like ass But it doesn't sound as good as you wouldn't use a pop filter

389
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:32,886
Speaker 0: now.

390
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:40,282
Speaker 0: actually here I'm the only one who actually has a pop filter in front of me Nurse holding the mic about four inches from her face, which is good Scott pretty much.

391
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:41,567
Speaker 0: She shoves the mic into his mouth.

392
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:46,009
Speaker 1: Yep That now because I like to lay down and be lazy and all that.

393
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:50,530
Speaker 2: I'm laying down and being lazy too, but I know how to not talk directly in you know towards the mic.

394
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:53,359
Speaker 0: Now luckily Scott actually isn't that bad about popping.

395
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,182
Speaker 0: I'm real bad.

396
00:25:54,443 --> 00:25:56,490
Speaker 0: just the way I talk and the way I form vowels.

397
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:57,475
Speaker 0: I pop all the time.

398
00:25:57,536 --> 00:25:58,622
Speaker 2: That's cuz you're a northern hick.

399
00:25:58,964 --> 00:25:59,386
Speaker 0: Yeah quiet.

400
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:00,130
Speaker 0: You're urban, Michigan.

401
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:04,302
Speaker 0: Hey get me drunk enough and I'll start speaking like a Michigander again.

402
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:06,250
Speaker 1: I'm the only civilized person here from Connecticut.

403
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:11,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, New York Yeah, you say you were.

404
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,102
Speaker 0: you lived in New York.

405
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:13,670
Speaker 0: you were there for what a bum.

406
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:16,741
Speaker 1: I lived in New York between the ages of zero and one.

407
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:17,283
Speaker 0: Yeah.

408
00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:22,642
Speaker 2: It's like I was born in, Georgia Me saying I'm from Georgia, even though I haven't lived there ever.

409
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:34,330
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, but like, you know My immediate family lived in Connecticut almost my whole life But like cousins and grandma and all those other people lived in New York and I went there very frequently to see them.

410
00:26:34,531 --> 00:26:35,238
Speaker 1: So it's like it's.

411
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:41,587
Speaker 1: you know, I'm no stranger Yeah, but anyway, if you if just record yourself lived in New York for the past six seven years.

412
00:26:41,627 --> 00:26:46,763
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have And you even worked in New York City for a while Yep But if you have the kind of voice.

413
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:47,750
Speaker 0: just record yourself and listen.

414
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,781
Speaker 0: The main thing is you always have to record yourself and listen to yourself.

415
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:56,130
Speaker 0: if you get embarrassed listening to yourself You're probably not the best person to be doing a podcast.

416
00:26:56,592 --> 00:27:01,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, also remember that if you've never listened to a recording of yourself before you don't sound weird.

417
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:13,204
Speaker 1: You don't sound the way you think you sound because the sound of your voice coming through your skull to your ears is not the way it sounds to other people who have your voice going through the air to their ears.

418
00:27:13,244 --> 00:27:17,562
Speaker 0: your voice sounds a lot deeper and more Awesome in your head than it does in the real world.

419
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:19,070
Speaker 0: You're gonna get over that fact.

420
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:22,830
Speaker 1: So when you hear yourself being recorded you hear recording of yourself.

421
00:27:23,171 --> 00:27:25,843
Speaker 1: That's what you sound like to other people whether you know it or not.

422
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:33,330
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with your microphone Yep, but you might think it sounds bad But other people are used to your voice and they don't necessarily think it sounds bad.

423
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,250
Speaker 2: Just because you think it sounds different than your normal voice doesn't mean it's bad.

424
00:27:36,752 --> 00:27:42,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I still think that my voice is bad when I hear it recorded, but it sounds great coming in my head.

425
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:51,190
Speaker 0: Yeah now later in the show we can talk more about how to make your voice sound good like really good Because my voice actually sounds quite a bit different in real life than it does in the podcast.

426
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:52,296
Speaker 0: But I do things to it.

427
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:59,637
Speaker 0: You got to use your $30 an hour voice But anyway to get to what I was talking about with the popping.

428
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:07,950
Speaker 0: basically if you if you record yourself and you hear a lot of popping going on You can buy what's called a pop filter.

429
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:12,875
Speaker 0: Now the thing is a pop filter costs like 30 bucks and That's a giant ripoff.

430
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:20,409
Speaker 0: because in front of my mouth right now is an embroidery loop With a pair of pantyhose stretched over it if you don't know an embroidery loop.

431
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,855
Speaker 1: Embroidery loop good game.

432
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:25,464
Speaker 1: Yep is this circle of wood?

433
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a circle of wood.

434
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,510
Speaker 0: I put pantyhose around it and taped it together and I just put it between me and the microphone.

435
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:34,601
Speaker 1: So my voice it's like a circular cloth shield.

436
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:37,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically your voice if you google for pop filters You'll see pictures.

437
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:40,070
Speaker 0: now my voice and the audio goes through just fine.

438
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:44,746
Speaker 0: But when I pop the air bounces off of this filter and doesn't hit the microphone directly.

439
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:45,950
Speaker 1: Well, not as much.

440
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,758
Speaker 1: It's not a hundred percent invincible, but it's it's good enough.

441
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, so listen to yourself.

442
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:52,770
Speaker 0: And if you need a pop filter, you'll hear it.

443
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:59,499
Speaker 0: it's pretty obvious because you'll sound like this and People don't like that.

444
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sounds really bad.

445
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:04,399
Speaker 0: All right, so you've got a microphone.

446
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:06,530
Speaker 0: you got to plug it to your computer somehow.

447
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,250
Speaker 0: Now Nuri versus Oz do it very different ways because we record very different podcasts near a different budget.

448
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:13,077
Speaker 0: So I'll let you go first.

449
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,066
Speaker 0: How do you connect up?

450
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:20,310
Speaker 2: All right Well, my microphones don't come with a cable because I got my microphones and my cables from one of my friends for free.

451
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:30,309
Speaker 2: So I have a microphone and I have a cable that plugs into the bottom of it And then it plugs into either in a mixer or something else on the other end.

452
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:35,570
Speaker 2: Well, I don't have a mixer because I couldn't find a mixer that could plug into my computer for pretty cheap.

453
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,750
Speaker 2: So I just got this little thing.

454
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:46,456
Speaker 2: it's called a Griffin i-mic and it's just this little tiny round disc that plugs into the USB port on my laptop and Has a headphone input jack.

455
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:58,399
Speaker 2: So I got a little converter that lets me plug the quarter inch plug from my microphone cable into the eighth inch plug on the Griffin i-mic and I just connect it straight to my computer just like that.

456
00:29:58,579 --> 00:29:59,161
Speaker 2: No mixer.

457
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:01,530
Speaker 2: No effects on it beforehand or anything.

458
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:04,230
Speaker 2: I do all of my editing and mixing digitally.

459
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:07,259
Speaker 0: Now there are both pros and cons to that.

460
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,970
Speaker 0: the pros I imagine are that it doesn't cost much.

461
00:30:10,251 --> 00:30:16,921
Speaker 2: yeah, it's completely free except for the $40 I spent on the i-mic and the $3 I spent on the converter.

462
00:30:17,564 --> 00:30:22,186
Speaker 0: now I could guess at the cons But I'm sure you could fill us in into all the difficulties you have with the setup.

463
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:26,070
Speaker 2: Yeah Well, um one of my microphone cables doesn't work so well.

464
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:30,050
Speaker 2: I think it only inputs on the left channel and it doesn't pick up half the audio.

465
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:35,790
Speaker 2: So all of my signals are really really low and there's something called a signal-to-noise ratio.

466
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:43,786
Speaker 2: This is key which means that You have a certain amount of audio signal going through your microphone and a certain amount of background noise picked up.

467
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:50,430
Speaker 2: if your background noise Is really high then your signal-to-noise ratio is really low and you don't like that.

468
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,402
Speaker 2: You want it to be really high because you want much more signal than noise.

469
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,208
Speaker 2: so you can cut it all up.

470
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:56,870
Speaker 2: all the noise.

471
00:30:57,492 --> 00:31:01,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the best signal-to-noise ratio is like a hajillion to zero.

472
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:02,726
Speaker 1: that's the best you can get.

473
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:11,658
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean basically The more distance there is between your all your voice and the noise the easier It is to get rid of the noise.

474
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:13,430
Speaker 0: because you can do all that in software.

475
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:19,750
Speaker 0: You can buy equipment that'll do it But we don't even use equipment to do it because you really don't need that equipment for a podcast.

476
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:35,703
Speaker 1: That's the thing is radio guys as in radio stations that you know broadcast live and such They have all this hardware equipment that you know performs audio operations to the actual Analog signal in real time and we have some of that.

477
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:37,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that's what they need to happen.

478
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:39,170
Speaker 1: They need it to happen immediately.

479
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:58,586
Speaker 1: So that's why they have dials and levers and switches Because you're making a podcast and you're recording it and then distributing it You can record it onto a file on your computer and do all the stuff that the dials and switches usually do You know after the fact using some piece of software like garage band or resound or something like that.

480
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:02,079
Speaker 0: now as dirty can probably tell You while that works great for most cases.

481
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,947
Speaker 0: It adds a lot of time to post-production.

482
00:32:04,128 --> 00:32:11,630
Speaker 1: Oh god Yeah, does it add time to post-production but it only works almost as well as the actual dials and switches.

483
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,751
Speaker 2: Well, if you listen my podcast, you'll notice it doesn't sound anywhere as good as geek nights and definitely don't listen to it in your Car.

484
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:21,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually we had a lot of problems before we got a compressor with geek nights and cars as well.

485
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:25,687
Speaker 0: one of our friends said that it's unlistenable in a car and sure enough it wasn't.

486
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,330
Speaker 1: I Tried to listen to it in the car and it was unlistenable.

487
00:32:28,752 --> 00:32:30,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we've since fixed that.

488
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:31,870
Speaker 0: now our input chain.

489
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:39,619
Speaker 0: We spent I'd say a hundred by eighty about a hundred and twenty bucks on the equipment that is sitting in front of me Between my microphone and the computer.

490
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:43,816
Speaker 2: you also have a very different kind of computer than I do So why don't you tell them what kind of?

491
00:32:43,876 --> 00:32:53,158
Speaker 0: yeah, so if you don't have a Mac laptop and use have a normal computer you've probably got a sound card and the sound card probably has a Core 8th inch little jack going into it.

492
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,423
Speaker 1: It's called the stereo mini.

493
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:56,210
Speaker 1: That's the normal headphone type plug.

494
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,401
Speaker 0: Yeah, anything at most normal headphones your.

495
00:32:58,522 --> 00:33:00,150
Speaker 0: it's the thing you plug into your iPod, whatever.

496
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,134
Speaker 1: Yep, the iPod hole.

497
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,864
Speaker 0: now if you have that you're all set because you can.

498
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:10,030
Speaker 0: there you go to Radio Shack or whatever You'll see a million adapters and you'll be able to get from whatever your equipment outputs to that jack.

499
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:14,826
Speaker 0: Now the thing is you don't really want to plug the microphone directly into that.

500
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:19,850
Speaker 0: if you can help it Even it no matter what no matter how little money you want to spend unless you want to spend no money.

501
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've done.

502
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:38,030
Speaker 1: there are decent podcasts I listen to that are literally a Logitech headset plugged directly into that hole and as long as you squiddle all your software Meters and all your volume things properly and it'll take you a couple hours It'll sound like the bare minimum of quality.

503
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:43,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, the main problem with it one is that you can't have guests because you have no way to have them talk.

504
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:48,330
Speaker 1: Actually, I know a guy who he just gets a Y adapter and plugs in more headsets.

505
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:53,525
Speaker 1: I could cry and then he brings the volume that it kind of works actually with my podcast.

506
00:33:53,565 --> 00:34:05,528
Speaker 2: We only have one input So we have one microphone and we pass it around between the three of us Which means that we have to do a crapload of post-production because every time we pass the microphone.

507
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:10,704
Speaker 2: There's a little Sound and that means that we have to go in and cut out every single one of those.

508
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:18,576
Speaker 0: Oh, oh my god yeah, so our input chain is we have a Eurorack UB 802 mixer.

509
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:25,331
Speaker 1: we found out about that because the guy who does the Roadhouse podcast, which is awesome blues music Recommended it.

510
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:26,737
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's actually very good.

511
00:34:26,757 --> 00:34:28,202
Speaker 0: It was like 60 bucks is fantastic.

512
00:34:28,262 --> 00:34:30,550
Speaker 0: Basically, it's got two now.

513
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:50,679
Speaker 0: This is the reason why this segment of today's podcast might not sound as good as the previous segment before we had Nury in Because this the mixer we have is great, but it has two Pre-amplified microphone inputs meaning I plug my microphone into slot one and Scott's is plugged into slot two and There's an amplifier there before it even hits the rest of the mixer.

514
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:53,650
Speaker 0: that amplifies the signal from the microphone to a good level.

515
00:34:54,751 --> 00:35:02,650
Speaker 0: Now the rest of the inputs don't have pre amplifiers So I had to turn everything else down so you could actually hear Nury talk because there's no preamp between her and you.

516
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:06,686
Speaker 2: That's because your mixer sucks and only has two good slots.

517
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:10,029
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, actually I can buy a little pre amplifier thingy.

518
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:15,190
Speaker 0: Just we haven't gotten around to that yet because this is the first time we've had a guest on the show since we got the compressor.

519
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:20,330
Speaker 1: I told you we should have bought the mixer with four holes, but no that mixer was like $40 more and I was cheap.

520
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:22,403
Speaker 2: Yeah, you guys don't have guests very often.

521
00:35:22,483 --> 00:35:23,470
Speaker 2: So it's not that big of a deal.

522
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,203
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of our guests are going to be with little handheld things at conventions.

523
00:35:27,223 --> 00:35:28,869
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm or over the phone.

524
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:35,450
Speaker 0: But anyway, then I have a headphone monitor coming out of the mixer so I can listen everyone's voices and set levels before we do.

525
00:35:36,412 --> 00:35:38,321
Speaker 0: But that's not in the signal chain.

526
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:40,090
Speaker 0: that's kind of like a sidechain to my ears.

527
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:46,906
Speaker 0: I don't wear it all the time when we talk From there the outputs of the mixer go into what's called a dynamic range compressor.

528
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:53,910
Speaker 0: now I'm not going to talk about the details of exactly how they work or how to pick one But we're gonna do a show on that someday.

529
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:57,430
Speaker 0: And if you really want to know just email us and I can send you all this information.

530
00:35:57,992 --> 00:36:07,841
Speaker 0: but basically it takes our audio coming out of the mixer that's raw and It keeps the levels the volumes all about the same.

531
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:14,881
Speaker 0: so above a certain threshold it decreases the Amplification so that the louder I get in real life.

532
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:31,128
Speaker 0: It doesn't get quite as loud recording to the computer Which means I can set the in the gain or the input level on the computer a lot higher Which means I'm recording with a lot more data Which means I can do a lot more stuff to the audio without making it sound like ass.

533
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:37,110
Speaker 1: Basically when you get too loud it makes you quiet and when you get too quiet it makes you loud.

534
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:40,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically this one doesn't actually make you louder.

535
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:42,536
Speaker 0: That's that would be a compander.

536
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:44,664
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's that's the general gist of what.

537
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:49,630
Speaker 0: the yeah, basically if you need It's called a compressor You can do it in software after the fact.

538
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:56,850
Speaker 0: But compressing is the one thing of all the things you can do after the fact that It really pays to do it before it hits your computer.

539
00:36:56,991 --> 00:37:05,377
Speaker 2: And that's important because when people listen to your show on headphones or in their car Volume jumps are gonna be really They're gonna hurt your ears.

540
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:09,514
Speaker 2: Even if they're a really small volume jump if you get a little bit louder It's gonna be painful here.

541
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:11,801
Speaker 0: I I just turned off the compressor.

542
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:14,609
Speaker 0: So now you're gonna hear the raw audio.

543
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,133
Speaker 2: Yay Yay, whoo.

544
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:20,162
Speaker 2: No, it's awesome.

545
00:37:20,223 --> 00:37:20,886
Speaker 2: I don't like that.

546
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:21,770
Speaker 2: I'll turn it back on.

547
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:22,813
Speaker 0: I turned it back on.

548
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:27,028
Speaker 0: the difference might not be so bad because actually I didn't calibrate the mixer the compressor.

549
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:28,615
Speaker 0: so much Mr.

550
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:30,230
Speaker 1: I had all the dials perfectly set.

551
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:32,719
Speaker 0: I have all perfectly set when there's the two of us.

552
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,080
Speaker 0: now.

553
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,650
Speaker 0: we got this random elephant of Nury who's laying over there.

554
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,828
Speaker 2: Oh, no women messing things up for you again.

555
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:40,814
Speaker 0: Alright.

556
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:44,430
Speaker 0: so we realized just now that we could talk about this forever.

557
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:55,303
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if we kept talking and talking eventually like professional radio guys to start calling us and telling us we're wrong or no You had to do this and God they would just be.

558
00:37:55,444 --> 00:38:01,810
Speaker 0: so I promised all of you We'll do a show someday in the future in detail like the specifics of we use a kid this compressor.

559
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:02,616
Speaker 0: This is how it works.

560
00:38:02,676 --> 00:38:03,402
Speaker 0: This is how you use it.

561
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:04,409
Speaker 0: This is why you want it, etc.

562
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:08,910
Speaker 0: But for now, I mean, this is just like a overview of how to not suck a podcast.

563
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:14,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, also there's plenty of other podcasts like infinity podcasts about how to podcast.

564
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:20,550
Speaker 2: Oh, there's a. there's a Podcasting for dummies book that has a companion podcast.

565
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:26,349
Speaker 2: so if you can't go out and get the book you can go to the for dummies comm website and download the podcast.

566
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:35,189
Speaker 2: and It's by T Morris and Evo Tara who are both a couple of podcasters and they've got a lot of experience doing it But it's got a lot of good tips in it.

567
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,798
Speaker 2: So go to your local store and check it out.

568
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:38,741
Speaker 2: Even if you don't buy it.

569
00:38:39,002 --> 00:38:39,965
Speaker 1: Oh, no a shill.

570
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:44,901
Speaker 1: Haha Yeah, there's also what's the other one podcast for one one?

571
00:38:44,941 --> 00:38:47,090
Speaker 2: I think yeah podcast for one one is good.

572
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,921
Speaker 2: They have interviews with podcasters every show.

573
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:52,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how I learned about a gizmo phone.

574
00:38:52,772 --> 00:38:55,603
Speaker 2: No, you learned about that from me, yeah, I listen to podcast for one.

575
00:38:55,623 --> 00:38:57,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, so indirectly I learned it from them.

576
00:38:58,531 --> 00:39:02,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know, we're only doing this because we have a lot of you know.

577
00:39:02,451 --> 00:39:14,375
Speaker 1: It seems like every podcast has a pile of listeners who don't know about podcasting and want the one podcast They listen to to tell them, you know instead of going in listening to every other podcast in the world It does the same thing.

578
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:17,809
Speaker 2: It's surprising how many podcasts there are out there about podcasting.

579
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:23,270
Speaker 1: Imagine if every TV show had to explain television because it was the only TV show that people watch.

580
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:24,996
Speaker 0: that was a very apt allegory.

581
00:39:25,216 --> 00:39:35,498
Speaker 1: or like every comic book had to explain to you how to read a comic book and how it Works because a lot of the Tokyo pop manga explain it just in case Read it backwards.

582
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's you know, it's a one-page deal.

583
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:39,953
Speaker 1: That's not like an entire Explanation of like.

584
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:43,970
Speaker 1: here is you put a grammar book in the front of your war and peace, you know.

585
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:48,753
Speaker 0: The main reason we're doing this is because I'm sorry But a lot of podcasts just are Unlistenable.

586
00:39:48,974 --> 00:39:54,014
Speaker 2: if you want to start a podcast we want you to know these basic things so that we can listen to it without Killing our yeah.

587
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:57,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, then we can judge you on your content and not on your inept.

588
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:00,744
Speaker 0: I don't care how good your content is if I can't listen to it.

589
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:01,808
Speaker 2: It's not gonna get listened to.

590
00:40:01,828 --> 00:40:06,847
Speaker 0: yep No by the same token if you spend a million dollars have awesome equipment, but you're just a guy going.

591
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:11,821
Speaker 2: so Yeah You You have to have a solid idea.

592
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:21,202
Speaker 2: Yeah The better your idea is the more crap audio people are willing to put up with but there is still a level where no one's Gonna listen to it.

593
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:30,030
Speaker 0: Now I guess we can talk a bit about post-production before we end here and by post-production I mean all the stuff you do after you recorded the episode.

594
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:30,392
Speaker 0: well,

595
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:37,932
Speaker 1: the first thing you do is you cut it out when someone says stuff like and And Yeah, yep,

596
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:41,329
Speaker 2: or when you have like a half hour of just laughing

597
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,690
Speaker 0: Scott and I actually cut out very little from episodes.

598
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:50,648
Speaker 0: I like maybe maybe a minutes worth of audio from an entire episode.

599
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:51,090
Speaker 0: we cut out.

600
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:53,398
Speaker 2: Ah, but how much did you do back when you started?

601
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,942
Speaker 0: when we started we'd cut out like 20 minutes of us Just saying penis at each other.

602
00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:12,833
Speaker 0: Usually the things we cut out are like silence Yeah saying um, or if one of us stopped talking Expecting the other person to chip in but the other person was like not paying attention which doesn't happen so often Except for just now.

603
00:41:13,255 --> 00:41:15,121
Speaker 0: Yeah, just but we're a little.

604
00:41:15,301 --> 00:41:17,870
Speaker 0: we've had a long weekend of geek and we're kind of tired right about now.

605
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I got a busy day at work actually tomorrow.

606
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:22,465
Speaker 0: Yeah grown, but that's key.

607
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:28,862
Speaker 0: So it basically It'll take a long time when you first start podcasting no matter how good you are.

608
00:41:29,143 --> 00:41:30,246
Speaker 0: You'll flub over words.

609
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:33,230
Speaker 0: You'll screw things up You'll you'll cough into the microphone.

610
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:34,604
Speaker 0: Everyone's looking at me

611
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:37,416
Speaker 1: Unless you're like who's

612
00:41:37,436 --> 00:41:38,660
Speaker 2: been sick for two weeks.

613
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:39,925
Speaker 0: Yeah for all of you.

614
00:41:40,005 --> 00:41:44,650
Speaker 0: the week after katsu khan I don't think you all understand how sick I was doing the podcast.

615
00:41:44,911 --> 00:41:54,599
Speaker 0: Well, I was listening to them and I didn't remember saying any of that stuff was Yeah, but anyway now Nuri you do a lot more editing.

616
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:56,904
Speaker 2: oh, yeah, well I've only done four.

617
00:41:57,626 --> 00:41:59,270
Speaker 2: I'm editing my fifth show right now.

618
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:04,918
Speaker 2: So you guys have done so many more shows than me and we're still working on Building our podcasting habits.

619
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, like we've got actually we're getting better about it.

620
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,710
Speaker 0: But the first time we had a guest on the show the first couple times.

621
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:21,039
Speaker 0: I don't know what image you have of us doing geek nights but I'm sitting with my back to almost everyone talking into a microphone and a pop filter and Staring at my computer and the show notes.

622
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:22,950
Speaker 0: Scott is laying on his back.

623
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:29,009
Speaker 0: You should take a big time with the microphone like in the air over his mouth and Nuri is kind of lounging on my bed.

624
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:30,854
Speaker 1: We should go take a soft.

625
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:32,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's awesome.

626
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:34,405
Speaker 0: My bed was made in like the 1800s the late 1800s, but still I wasn't lying.

627
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,037
Speaker 2: That's not important.

628
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not at all.

629
00:42:39,772 --> 00:42:42,409
Speaker 0: but and People who we interview or people we have on the show?

630
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:47,110
Speaker 0: They expect us to be talking to each other because it sounds like we're just two guys standing room talking to each other.

631
00:42:47,472 --> 00:42:48,477
Speaker 0: We're not looking at each other.

632
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:50,185
Speaker 0: We're not gesturing in any way.

633
00:42:50,205 --> 00:42:51,150
Speaker 0: He's lying.

634
00:42:51,411 --> 00:43:01,582
Speaker 1: Imagine like we're in a TV studio just like yeah, and we have two desks and a whole bunch of couches Between you real fancy microphones and a backdrop that looks like the Hudson River.

635
00:43:01,743 --> 00:43:04,410
Speaker 0: our set looks exactly like The Daily Show.

636
00:43:05,994 --> 00:43:07,306
Speaker 1: In fact, it is The Daily Show.

637
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:09,395
Speaker 0: Yeah John Stewart.

638
00:43:09,858 --> 00:43:10,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's here right now.

639
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:12,110
Speaker 0: He's sitting in the corner.

640
00:43:13,351 --> 00:43:14,135
Speaker 0: He's making this motion.

641
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,139
Speaker 0: Like don't say I'm here.

642
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:16,966
Speaker 0: I'm supposed to be now.

643
00:43:17,006 --> 00:43:17,508
Speaker 0: he's mad now.

644
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:17,890
Speaker 0: He's gone.

645
00:43:18,733 --> 00:43:19,175
Speaker 0: He left.

646
00:43:19,376 --> 00:43:19,797
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

647
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:21,042
Speaker 1: Oh, they're coming.

648
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:22,930
Speaker 1: I see a cane coming out from behind the curtain.

649
00:43:23,914 --> 00:43:24,747
Speaker 1: It's around my neck.

650
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:31,189
Speaker 1: see I Thought that'd be funny.

651
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,893
Speaker 1: I Don't care you do it everyone.

652
00:43:33,913 --> 00:43:40,967
Speaker 0: All right, see now I'm not gonna cut out what just happened But that's the kind of thing that you can cut out like if someone makes a deadpan joke Nobody laughs.

653
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:46,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, or it's just not funny dong See if it were for the fact that it probably annoy you I'm can.

654
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:54,080
Speaker 0: I was considering just now not editing what we just recorded at All so you can hear the raw like rah rah rah podcast.

655
00:43:54,723 --> 00:43:59,357
Speaker 0: however Most of the cuts are just silence between bits as we collect our thoughts.

656
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,604
Speaker 1: one day Maybe we should.

657
00:44:00,624 --> 00:44:02,960
Speaker 1: when we do a show we should put up like two posts.

658
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,177
Speaker 1: We should be like post the podcast post special unedited version.

659
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:07,980
Speaker 0: even better.

660
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,478
Speaker 0: We'll post the podcast and then we'll post a stream of all the audio that was cut out.

661
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:13,947
Speaker 1: They could do that.

662
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,580
Speaker 0: That would be good because it's not that much.

663
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,896
Speaker 0: That would be something trivial that I'm sure at least some of you would like to listen to.

664
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:22,008
Speaker 0: yeah It's mostly obscenities or silence.

665
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,580
Speaker 2: Yeah back to the whole communicating with each other thing.

666
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,409
Speaker 2: Communication between the podcasters is really important.

667
00:44:28,429 --> 00:44:30,919
Speaker 2: I mean, I know you guys have kind of interrupting cow moo.

668
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:38,800
Speaker 2: Yeah, you guys have kind of How to talk to each other even when you're not looking at each other, but for my podcast we have one microphone.

669
00:44:39,163 --> 00:44:46,479
Speaker 2: We're in a triangle staring at each other And if we want to say something we have to like stare at the person who's got the mic and hold out our hand.

670
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:51,349
Speaker 0: That stuff I mean a lot of podcasters is one guy.

671
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:54,839
Speaker 0: the more people you have the harder it is be ready for that.

672
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:59,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, one guy or one girl is the easiest podcast in the universe.

673
00:44:59,376 --> 00:45:07,358
Speaker 0: Yes, two is okay But it took Scott and I about 20 episodes to get down where we don't keep interrupting each other or where one of us will stop talking.

674
00:45:07,398 --> 00:45:08,282
Speaker 0: the other one doesn't pick Up.

675
00:45:08,808 --> 00:45:09,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't even really think about it.

676
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,920
Speaker 0: It's just kind of like, you know I just do the well for anyone doesn't know us when the podcast stops We just keep talking almost exactly the way we're talking now For the next several hours without a microphone in front of our faces.

677
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:26,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could pretty much we could do a 24-hour show if you really wanted and it would be mostly interesting.

678
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:29,808
Speaker 2: It would be mostly Scott playing video games.

679
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:30,991
Speaker 0: Yeah, or so.

680
00:45:31,032 --> 00:45:32,456
Speaker 1: I don't play that many video games.

681
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,460
Speaker 1: usually just because you people are here I can't actually do any work on my computer.

682
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:40,399
Speaker 1: So instead you play video games exactly because then at least someone will be entertained by watching the video game.

683
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:43,653
Speaker 1: And you can't tell me you don't like watching video games.

684
00:45:43,733 --> 00:45:49,095
Speaker 0: in addition to editing, you know Like actually cutting things out you have to do some sort of post-production filtering.

685
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:50,240
Speaker 0: I don't know.

686
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:52,012
Speaker 2: Yeah, you don't have to.

687
00:45:52,113 --> 00:45:57,800
Speaker 0: you should Very simply very briefly a noise gate.

688
00:45:58,503 --> 00:46:07,960
Speaker 0: All it does is you can say any noise below a certain volume Where this this noise or this volume lasts for a certain amount of time will be cut out entirely.

689
00:46:08,762 --> 00:46:18,937
Speaker 0: That can cut out like breathing noises between when anyone's talking or static from your mixer or Anything like that any background noise me bumping into the microphone.

690
00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:19,399
Speaker 0: Oh

691
00:46:20,423 --> 00:46:21,105
Speaker 1: The problem is

692
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:21,767
Speaker 0: if

693
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:35,377
Speaker 1: you don't if you turn it up too high or if you have too much noise you'll end up either cutting out all the noise and some of your voice or You know not enough of the noise and it's really tough unless you have really behaved.

694
00:46:35,437 --> 00:46:36,240
Speaker 1: well-behaved noise.

695
00:46:36,644 --> 00:46:37,977
Speaker 0: Yeah now well-behaved.

696
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:49,077
Speaker 0: There some people get good at like the DJ voice or the radio voice and they can talk at a fairly Constant volume at around a regular at a regular rate and they hold the microphone said distance from their mouth.

697
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:51,082
Speaker 1: Hey everybody It's Saturday.

698
00:46:51,664 --> 00:46:52,949
Speaker 0: A lot of people can't do that.

699
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,980
Speaker 0: So the other thing you can do is called compression.

700
00:46:57,061 --> 00:46:59,574
Speaker 0: Now I talked about compression already with the hardware.

701
00:46:59,614 --> 00:47:00,800
Speaker 0: You can also do it in software.

702
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,982
Speaker 0: I highly recommend that you do some form of compression on your podcast Software.

703
00:47:07,002 --> 00:47:09,228
Speaker 2: do you use to do software?

704
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:13,600
Speaker 0: Well, I use resound which I find to be absolutely fantastic.

705
00:47:13,823 --> 00:47:22,787
Speaker 0: But if you're a Linux awesome Yeah It's only for Linux and you might have some trouble getting it to work a hundred percent if you use any sort of Good distro except Ubuntu.

706
00:47:22,847 --> 00:47:23,771
Speaker 0: It just works in Ubuntu.

707
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,120
Speaker 1: Yep, you can use garage band.

708
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,532
Speaker 1: I know garage band has a very nice compression.

709
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you have a bag and your lead Yeah, and you can figure it out.

710
00:47:31,908 --> 00:47:39,798
Speaker 2: cuz I've got garage band and I don't know I don't have the garage band version that supports the make a podcast.

711
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:43,456
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah The real newest garage band has the podcasting stuff in it.

712
00:47:43,476 --> 00:47:44,139
Speaker 1: So that's nice.

713
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:44,621
Speaker 2: It'll.

714
00:47:44,702 --> 00:47:48,719
Speaker 2: it'll actually do the noise gate while you're recording and it does like pops and stuff.

715
00:47:49,621 --> 00:47:52,179
Speaker 0: That's a real-time audio is a pain in the ass in Linux.

716
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:58,199
Speaker 0: but the thing is most real-time filters don't help much because you can do them just as easily after the fact.

717
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:04,080
Speaker 0: and The clipping is the limiting factor in recording and your sound card can't do anything about clipping.

718
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:07,380
Speaker 0: That all has to be done with hardware before it hits the computer.

719
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:14,552
Speaker 1: Yep, the most popular podcast software seems to either be audacity Which is for all so all operating which actually we also use.

720
00:48:14,572 --> 00:48:16,760
Speaker 0: we use both resound and audacity for different purposes.

721
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:24,460
Speaker 2: Audacity is the free provided software online and all the podcast directories like podcast alley linked to it.

722
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,080
Speaker 0: Yep, it's just a multitrack editors.

723
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,679
Speaker 0: You can line up all your tracks and just export and it has compressors and stuff in it.

724
00:48:30,262 --> 00:48:34,300
Speaker 1: The other thing a lot of people use I don't know I don't think it's a hundred percent free is cast blaster.

725
00:48:34,923 --> 00:48:45,773
Speaker 1: cast blaster is like the one-stop shop for podcasting like it does everything from beginning to end from Recording to uploading to your website and making the post and the show notes.

726
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:46,896
Speaker 0: now, isn't it Windows only?

727
00:48:47,197 --> 00:48:49,379
Speaker 1: it is Windows only Which is why we do not use it.

728
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:56,123
Speaker 0: Yeah Then we're thinking about using it for like conventions where we won't have all our equipment with us or we won't have like my computer With us.

729
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:56,908
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

730
00:48:56,989 --> 00:49:02,480
Speaker 1: it has one nice thing about cast blaster Buttons and you can assign like audio files to the buttons.

731
00:49:03,002 --> 00:49:07,119
Speaker 1: So let's say you have a button with a funny jingle on it like rim doesn't give a shit.

732
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:15,848
Speaker 1: Well while you're recording you just push the rim doesn't give a shit button and it'll play that instead of having to add in rim Doesn't give a shit after you're done recording.

733
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:17,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can also do that with compressors.

734
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:19,180
Speaker 0: It's called auto ducking.

735
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,586
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into that now.

736
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:23,659
Speaker 0: That's well beyond what you need to know well beyond.

737
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:30,679
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you want to go the extra step and buy a program that's a little bit higher quality than those there's a program called.

738
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:31,493
Speaker 2: What is it?

739
00:49:32,243 --> 00:49:33,099
Speaker 2: Adobe Audition.

740
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:34,824
Speaker 2: Yeah Windows machines.

741
00:49:34,904 --> 00:49:39,080
Speaker 0: now Adobe Audition is actually mostly this other program called cool edit.

742
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:42,800
Speaker 0: If you can find a copy of cool edit for Windows use it use it use it.

743
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,907
Speaker 0: It's fantastic don't use it does?

744
00:49:45,168 --> 00:49:47,115
Speaker 0: Adobe bought it and raped the shell.

745
00:49:47,155 --> 00:49:48,420
Speaker 0: That was that program.

746
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,694
Speaker 2: Yeah, they probably charge a heck of a lot more for it, too.

747
00:49:51,077 --> 00:49:55,160
Speaker 1: Yeah But whatever Sony also makes a program.

748
00:49:56,282 --> 00:49:59,997
Speaker 2: I think it's called sound Forge, but it's pretty much the equivalent of the Adobe one.

749
00:50:00,017 --> 00:50:03,029
Speaker 0: Oh I've used that in that audio class.

750
00:50:03,089 --> 00:50:05,077
Speaker 0: I took with katsu at RIT wasn't there?

751
00:50:05,097 --> 00:50:05,679
Speaker 1: Pro Tools?

752
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:09,869
Speaker 0: Is well beyond what you need to do a pod.

753
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:12,798
Speaker 2: Pro Tools is what professional recording studios use.

754
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:16,207
Speaker 1: yeah But you can use it and it'll work If you want.

755
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:21,875
Speaker 0: yeah if you have money Buy a firewire mixer and a Mac and Pro Tools and it'll do.

756
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:22,899
Speaker 0: is about everything you need.

757
00:50:23,362 --> 00:50:25,455
Speaker 1: Sony also makes some sort of Windows software.

758
00:50:25,475 --> 00:50:35,081
Speaker 0: I don't know what it's called now a noise gate compression and The main thing here is normalization Even if you don't do anything else Normalize.

759
00:50:35,563 --> 00:50:40,440
Speaker 0: if the first half of your podcast is real loud the second half is quiet or every day is a different volume.

760
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:41,655
Speaker 0: It's just gonna piss me off.

761
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:50,420
Speaker 1: Yep, normalizing will at least make sure that the volume is Somewhat the same throughout, you know from day to day from minute to minute.

762
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:54,820
Speaker 2: So what's the difference in your waveform before you normalize and after you normalize?

763
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,920
Speaker 0: Well, it depends on whether or not you do dynamic normalization now basically a normal normalizer.

764
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:02,149
Speaker 0: That sounded really dumb a normal normalizer.

765
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,640
Speaker 1: Anyway, the standard basic normal.

766
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:15,020
Speaker 0: all it'll do is it'll find the loudest point in your podcast and Amplify everything in your podcast until that loudest point is as loud as a wave file can make something loud.

767
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:16,211
Speaker 0: that's all it'll do.

768
00:51:16,232 --> 00:51:22,540
Speaker 0: a Dynamic one will go through your podcast and amplify different parts by different amounts to make everything louder.

769
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:26,654
Speaker 0: But make things that are already loud stay the current loudness and not get louder.

770
00:51:26,955 --> 00:51:29,024
Speaker 0: to use the word loud a lot of times in one sentence.

771
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:32,500
Speaker 1: I Can't think of another word for loud right now.

772
00:51:34,663 --> 00:51:37,330
Speaker 0: Loud Painful.

773
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:42,687
Speaker 0: Now what I do.

774
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:44,620
Speaker 0: just a lot of podcasts seem to do this lately.

775
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,486
Speaker 0: But basically you want your podcast to be as loud as possible Not as quiet as possible.

776
00:51:49,867 --> 00:51:53,660
Speaker 0: the standard generally in terms of audio on the internet is make it loud.

777
00:51:54,441 --> 00:52:11,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the thing is is if you make it quiet that means that you know If you want people to be able to hear it They have to make it loud on their end using their stereo their iPod Whatever and if they do that what happens is all the really bad parts of the audio like the hissing and whatnot.

778
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:18,539
Speaker 0: Get louder also When and it's just bad you want to do as much that you can to the audio before they get to it.

779
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:19,708
Speaker 0: that way They don't have to do much.

780
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:20,274
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

781
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,650
Speaker 0: Now in audacity a lot of podcasters seem to use the standard of.

782
00:52:25,031 --> 00:52:28,060
Speaker 0: they'll normalize to negative point two decibels.

783
00:52:28,983 --> 00:52:30,649
Speaker 0: If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it.

784
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:33,580
Speaker 0: if you normalize or amplified send it to that.

785
00:52:34,008 --> 00:52:35,961
Speaker 0: It's a nice Baseline.

786
00:52:36,342 --> 00:52:39,633
Speaker 2: if you the default in audacity is that normalizes to zero?

787
00:52:39,653 --> 00:52:41,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do it to negative point two.

788
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,570
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot of people do that there.

789
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:45,139
Speaker 0: There's almost no difference between the two.

790
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:56,018
Speaker 2: Well, it's negative point two indeed As opposed to zero which is uh, I'm just saying if you want to use zero If you want to use audacity, you're gonna have to set that.

791
00:52:56,581 --> 00:53:01,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, one thing you can do is just Google around online and look at what other podcasters do in terms of their settings.

792
00:53:02,323 --> 00:53:09,420
Speaker 0: But keep in mind that if they say specific numbers They're not gonna help you much in a lot of cases because your levels are probably a lot different from their levels.

793
00:53:09,881 --> 00:53:17,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, when people are talking about specific numbers in their settings, that's pretty much like a case-by-case basis eight six, seven five three.

794
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:20,774
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that is not rims phone number.

795
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:26,352
Speaker 1: Do not call that If anyone if anyone doesn't know what that is, you're all.

796
00:53:26,372 --> 00:53:28,780
Speaker 1: you're going on the uncool list along with the rest of the people.

797
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,035
Speaker 0: How about just born after the 80s?

798
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:35,348
Speaker 0: No, actually if you call it, I'm not gonna give.

799
00:53:35,408 --> 00:53:38,520
Speaker 1: I don't know that it sounded to me like you just said uncool.

800
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,950
Speaker 0: Now I'm not gonna give you my phone number But for all of since you know My phone was lost and that cool guy is sending it to me.

801
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:55,979
Speaker 0: if you call if someone knows my phone number and calls it Some FedEx guy is gonna have a loud cell phone ringtone going off in his in the back of his truck.

802
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:01,720
Speaker 0: I Swear to God if my phone gets blown up because they think it's a bomb.

803
00:54:02,762 --> 00:54:04,360
Speaker 1: Dude, I'm totally calling it tomorrow.

804
00:54:08,282 --> 00:54:10,615
Speaker 0: All right, so we're basically done here.

805
00:54:10,655 --> 00:54:11,479
Speaker 0: we've gone long enough.

806
00:54:12,263 --> 00:54:17,164
Speaker 0: If your podcast sucks make it not suck and if you have a question we have for like.

807
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:27,680
Speaker 0: seriously if you have a question about how to do podcasts email us or post in the forums or Find Nuri's podcast which will link to and I ask her because that we all know a lot about this stuff.

808
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:34,589
Speaker 0: And if you have a specific question, we can answer it in fairly deep detail Because he sits at work all day and does nothing.

809
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,180
Speaker 1: quite you, you know, who else can answer the question?

810
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,831
Speaker 1: Google Google can answer the question.

811
00:54:40,434 --> 00:54:41,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll be wary.

812
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:48,413
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot of podcasters that have a site on how to do a podcast But they don't know what they're talking about and they're just they're making shit up.

813
00:54:49,156 --> 00:54:50,100
Speaker 1: Well, they're not making it up.

814
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:54,200
Speaker 1: They're just you know, they think they're doing good when they're not doing so good because they're not informed.

815
00:54:54,581 --> 00:55:09,325
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like that guy who pretends he knows that he's talking about Samir Gupta Rim Samir Show on Samir Gupta someday and Roland pika-pam Roland peak Paley Whatever his name is.

816
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:10,330
Speaker 0: I don't know how to pronounce it.

817
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,073
Speaker 1: I don't either.

818
00:55:11,335 --> 00:55:12,400
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not that hard though.

819
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:20,757
Speaker 2: I mean you search on Google for how to make a podcast And you should be able to tell pretty quickly which sites are good which says aren't two sites that say the same thing You're on the right track.

820
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,189
Speaker 1: Yeah As long as one didn't copy from the other.

821
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:28,200
Speaker 1: another good way to tell is if a guy says something Listen to his podcast and see what it sounds like.

822
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:38,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, if he tells you how to do a podcast and his podcast sounds like to say what I've been saying all night Yeah, what you could also do is go around listening to podcasts and find one.

823
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:48,777
Speaker 1: find ones that you know look good and seem like they spent the same amount of money you're gonna spend and See if they have an episode about how they do it because a lot of them do.

824
00:55:48,857 --> 00:55:51,990
Speaker 1: I'd say about 75% of podcasts have an episode about how they do it.

825
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:56,831
Speaker 0: and if you're gonna spend about $100 ask us Because I think our podcast sounds really good.

826
00:55:57,173 --> 00:55:58,599
Speaker 2: Hey, maybe you guys should have a.

827
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:05,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, because you know everyone in the frickin world keeps asking us to do a show on it to do a post on it.

828
00:56:05,621 --> 00:56:09,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, so God doesn't want to do it Because everyone else freaking does it.

829
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:16,905
Speaker 2: that you know, I know another podcast But your podcast sounds better than most of the other podcasts out there that I listen to and I listen to a shitload of Podcasts.

830
00:56:17,187 --> 00:56:19,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I think we should do a public service to the world.

831
00:56:20,562 --> 00:56:22,155
Speaker 0: All right, all right anyway.

832
00:56:22,478 --> 00:56:25,777
Speaker 0: once again I apologize if the second half of the show doesn't sound as good as you're used to.

833
00:56:25,797 --> 00:56:28,233
Speaker 1: you know The part we talked about how to make it sound good.

834
00:56:28,816 --> 00:56:32,180
Speaker 0: Yeah part Once I'm gonna buy another pre amplifier.

835
00:56:32,361 --> 00:56:35,699
Speaker 0: So when we have guests on the show, we can actually use the mixer the way we're supposed to.

836
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,471
Speaker 2: Yeah, invite me back when that happens.

837
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:42,902
Speaker 1: Yeah You Roy Jenkins See.

838
00:56:42,922 --> 00:57:00,139
Speaker 0: now this is the part that we cut off at the end of the show or just play the music And That was geek nights with rim and Scott special.

839
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,264
