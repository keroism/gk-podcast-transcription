1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,567
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, November 20th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:11,971
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,335
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:15,040
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights!

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,174
Speaker 1: Tonight, short reviews of Yoamushi Pedal and The Wind Rises.

6
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:23,518
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

7
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:29,052
Speaker 1: So I've been playing that Pokemon X now.

8
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:29,915
Speaker 1: It's about time.

9
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:30,357
Speaker 1: No, you're not.

10
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:32,606
Speaker 0: You're playing... Oh, you are playing Pokemon X. Yeah.

11
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:35,016
Speaker 0: I'm still playing Pokemon Black 1.

12
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:35,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:43,080
Speaker 1: I skipped... I played the original Pokemon, I played Pokemon Pearl, and now I'm playing X, and nothing in between.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,212
Speaker 0: I beat every Pokemon from red up to... well, one per generation, right?

15
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:56,240
Speaker 0: I beat one Pokemon per generation all the way from the beginning, when that was the only Pokemon there was, up to... I'm in the middle of black, so I'm not gonna break my chain.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,701
Speaker 1: You know what?

17
00:00:56,721 --> 00:01:03,599
Speaker 1: Fuck all those games, because of all the Pokemon that have come out recently, X is just the best iteration, by far.

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,008
Speaker 0: The best Pokemon has almost always been the best Pokemon.

19
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:11,100
Speaker 0: I know, but this one... It is rare, it is rare that the newest generation is not the preferred generation.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:21,925
Speaker 1: But in terms of my own enjoyment of Pokemon, one, this game, like, you walk in, and you do your basic stuff, and then right away the game's like, "Yo, dog, here's some rollerblades, you can go fast.

21
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:23,830
Speaker 1: Yo, dog, you want another starter?

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,618
Speaker 1: Yo, dog, here's everything you want to make the game awesome right the fuck

23
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:27,919
Speaker 1: away.".

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,869
Speaker 1: XP share, that's just an option.

25
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,640
Speaker 1: You get it, like, five minutes in.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's leaning towards what we want, which is just pick your stats, pick your level, but it's not quite there yet.

27
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:44,120
Speaker 1: ED training, you can just click on that, but there's three things I've noticed about this game that I kind of want to talk about briefly, guys.

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:51,300
Speaker 1: So one, the sexual overtones related to balls in the side dialogue...

29
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:53,880
Speaker 0: Have always been there since the very first Pokemon.

30
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,199
Speaker 1: ...is a little more prominent in this one.

31
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:56,800
Speaker 0: Okay.

32
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:03,197
Speaker 1: Every fifth or sixth person I talk to is like, "Yo, I've got the best balls around.

33
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:03,719
Speaker 1: You want to see

34
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:03,860
Speaker 1: them?".

35
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:04,880
Speaker 1: Yeah.

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,360
Speaker 1: Like, it's kind of amazing.

37
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,628
Speaker 0: Are they dark balls?

38
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,574
Speaker 0: Dusk balls?

39
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,332
Speaker 1: But two, you pick a guy or a girl, and they have the whole dress-up thing.

40
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:19,960
Speaker 1: You can spend lots of Poke dollars to dress your character up.

41
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:26,177
Speaker 1: The guy's options are basically, do you want black pants or dark brown pants?

42
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:27,300
Speaker 1: Like, they suck.

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,412
Speaker 1: So, I'm playing as a girl because there's lots of cool fashion stuff you can do.

44
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,480
Speaker 1: Guys basically don't get to play that game.

45
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:35,187
Speaker 1: Okay.

46
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:36,260
Speaker 1: Way to go, sexist Japan.

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:46,660
Speaker 1: And you know all these kids, like, there's all these kids, which are kind of annoying because they keep showing up and talking to you like you're their friend, and you're just trying to get them to go away so you can continue to fight and get Pokemon.

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,640
Speaker 1: But of all of them, there's Tierno, who's like this fat otaku kid who's kind of awesome.

49
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,256
Speaker 0: Okay.

50
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,619
Speaker 0: What kind of Pokemon does he have?

51
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,247
Speaker 1: I already don't remember.

52
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:58,614
Speaker 1: He had some dumb Pokemon.

53
00:02:58,634 --> 00:02:59,720
Speaker 1: I haven't fought him too much.

54
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,991
Speaker 0: I'm sure they would be nerdy, right?

55
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:01,375
Speaker 0: I don't know.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,824
Speaker 1: He's just a nerdy guy.

57
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:06,480
Speaker 1: Like, he's wearing a "that guy" shirt, and he was really into dancing.

58
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,655
Speaker 0: It has a picture of a wolf Pokemon howling at the Pokemon.

59
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:13,447
Speaker 0: I don't know.

60
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,475
Speaker 0: What's a wolf Pokemon?

61
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:15,100
Speaker 0: I can't think of one.

62
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,900
Speaker 1: Well, there's that new Poodle Pokemon, which I have named Woodle.

63
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,240
Speaker 0: I would not use a Poodle Pokemon.

64
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,459
Speaker 1: So I tried to name...

65
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,940
Speaker 0: I only use evil Pokemon and horrifically cute Pokemon.

66
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,751
Speaker 1: Yeah, so one of the Pokemon I picked up, I named him Murasame.

67
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:28,860
Speaker 1: He's just this floating fucking sword.

68
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,300
Speaker 1: And his story is, some guy got fucking killed, and his soul is trapped in this sword.

69
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,579
Speaker 0: That is my kind of Pokemon.

70
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,320
Speaker 0: And you know what?

71
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,740
Speaker 0: That is a Scott Pokemon right there.

72
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,180
Speaker 1: He's all, like, dark and steel and ghost and dangerous.

73
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:40,727
Speaker 0: Fuck yes.

74
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:41,300
Speaker 0: Best Pokemon.

75
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,480
Speaker 0: Swords, evil, perfect.

76
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,560
Speaker 0: Also, the best Pokemons are cute, like Combee.

77
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of these fairy Pokemon are going to be up your alley.

78
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:50,798
Speaker 0: Alright.

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,656
Speaker 1: I saw a Combee, but...

80
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,519
Speaker 0: Was it which kind?

81
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:56,679
Speaker 1: Uh, the unevolved Combee.

82
00:03:57,424 --> 00:03:58,619
Speaker 0: Was it male or female Combee?

83
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,459
Speaker 1: I don't know.

84
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,399
Speaker 0: You should be able to tell just by looking at it.

85
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:02,790
Speaker 0: What kind of Poketrainer are you?

86
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,859
Speaker 0: You didn't even look at your Pokedex.

87
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:13,452
Speaker 1: Apparently, I'm the best fucking Pokemon trainer ever, because everyone I talked to was like, "Whoa, there's some kind of crazy aura emanating from Lady R. Wow, she's just beating everybody.

88
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:13,693
Speaker 1: Oh my

89
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:14,096
Speaker 1: gosh.".

90
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,617
Speaker 1: But I tried to name my Bulbasaur Bulbasaur, and it was like, "I guess you don't want to name your Pokemon

91
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:20,940
Speaker 1: anything.".

92
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,576
Speaker 1: And it wouldn't let me.

93
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,940
Speaker 1: But then he evolved into Ivysaur, and I was able to then change his name to Bulbasaur.

94
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,599
Speaker 1: So my Ivysaur's name is Bulbasaur.

95
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,520
Speaker 1: But there's a girl character.

96
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,569
Speaker 1: She's like, "What are your

97
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:31,853
Speaker 1: friends?".

98
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,600
Speaker 1: And she... You know, there's friend stuff in this game.

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,580
Speaker 1: She, like, wants to be friends with you.

100
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:39,040
Speaker 0: Instead of one rival, it's like a team of rivals?

101
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:41,859
Speaker 1: You have a team of rivals, but they're all also friendly with you.

102
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:44,839
Speaker 0: So it's like ten Garys?

103
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,919
Speaker 1: The girl is totally crushing on me.

104
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,615
Speaker 1: And there's this scene where, like, you do a bunch of stuff with her, and then she's like, "Oh, let's go watch the fireworks

105
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:52,998
Speaker 1: together.".

106
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:57,440
Speaker 1: And then you get this whole FMV where you guys sit and watch the fireworks in this castle.

107
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:04,060
Speaker 1: And it's all super romantic, and she's like, "I will treasure this moment that I spent with you for the rest of my life.

108
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,173
Speaker 1: This is... I hope we can be very close

109
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:06,536
Speaker 1: friends.".

110
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,139
Speaker 1: And she's totally hitting on me, and I'm totally a girl, and I love this.

111
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:15,040
Speaker 1: I like the fact that this is a character who is...

112
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,900
Speaker 0: Did she show you her balls?

113
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:18,600
Speaker 1: She showed me all of her balls.

114
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:19,898
Speaker 1: She has more than two.

115
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually people carry six.

116
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,220
Speaker 1: I like the fact that she is really, obviously, hitting on my character.

117
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,480
Speaker 1: And two, she has the same dialogue regardless of what gender you choose.

118
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:36,700
Speaker 1: So this sort of gender-neutral relationship thing going on is pleasing to my eyes.

119
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:41,600
Speaker 0: At the start of the game, they're totally sexist, not letting the dudes play dress-up, but then they're totally...

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,500
Speaker 1: Well, the dudes can play dress-up, it's just the dress-up options for dudes suck.

121
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:46,519
Speaker 0: And then they're totally the opposite later on.

122
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,480
Speaker 1: I think it's just whoever designed the clothes for guys was really uninspired.

123
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:53,589
Speaker 1: Also, you can sit down.

124
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,860
Speaker 1: You can just sit down on stuff.

125
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:56,448
Speaker 1: I kind of like that.

126
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,700
Speaker 1: Very Ragnarok style.

127
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,999
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm enjoying my Pokemons.

128
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:01,859
Speaker 0: Is that it?

129
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:03,258
Speaker 1: That's what I'm doing right now.

130
00:06:03,502 --> 00:06:03,992
Speaker 0: All right, let's...

131
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:12,620
Speaker 1: And I've noticed, now that I'm carrying my DS around, my 3DS, every single person I've met in StreetPass for the last week has been playing Pokemon.

132
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,139
Speaker 0: That's true.

133
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,492
Speaker 1: Every single one.

134
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:15,242
Speaker 0: A full load of 10.

135
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:15,980
Speaker 0: Except me, everybody.

136
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,581
Speaker 0: Every day.

137
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,240
Speaker 1: All Pokemon, except one kid who was playing system settings.

138
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,480
Speaker 0: Except me, everybody.

139
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,102
Speaker 1: Yeah.

140
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:22,415
Speaker 1: I don't know what you've been playing.

141
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:22,859
Speaker 1: I gotta go see.

142
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:26,200
Speaker 0: Rune Factory and Picross.

143
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,386
Speaker 1: I've got Rune Factory.

144
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:29,660
Speaker 1: I haven't played much of it yet, but I'm totally hitting on that dragon.

145
00:06:31,564 --> 00:06:33,920
Speaker 1: I want to hit on the mayor of town, the dragon girl.

146
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,979
Speaker 0: You're the mayor of town.

147
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:41,820
Speaker 1: The girl I fell on, like the dragon whatever, but I don't think I can, so I think I'm going to hit on the town guard.

148
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,139
Speaker 0: That's who I've been hitting on.

149
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,520
Speaker 1: She's way more powerful than everyone else.

150
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,231
Speaker 0: That is the only person worth hitting on.

151
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:48,320
Speaker 0: Everyone else is kind of stupid.

152
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,098
Speaker 1: So anyway.

153
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,960
Speaker 0: I guess second choice might be like flower shop girl.

154
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:53,779
Speaker 1: She's okay.

155
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, or piano music girl.

156
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,134
Speaker 1: Actually, if I were a girl in the game, the guys I can hit on, I think are way better choices, but...

157
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,059
Speaker 0: Are you going to hit an old guy?

158
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,197
Speaker 1: Not old guy.

159
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,500
Speaker 1: So yeah, brief news.

160
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,680
Speaker 1: We are vaguely aware of this Vanguard thing.

161
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,301
Speaker 0: Yep.

162
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:17,919
Speaker 0: Basically, at Kinetic Con two years ago, we did this "Come and do your panel" panel, which is like...

163
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,399
Speaker 1: Like a panel gong show.

164
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,739
Speaker 1: Or panel auditions.

165
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:31,558
Speaker 0: And some guy came in, did this panel about Card Fight Vanguard, which is some collectible card game I never heard of before, and the way he presented it, I was like, "Oh, that game actually doesn't sound half bad for a collectible card

166
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:31,799
Speaker 0: game.".

167
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,720
Speaker 1: Guy did a good job.

168
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,640
Speaker 1: But then we started noticing it around.

169
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,417
Speaker 1: We saw a bunch of this...

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, then once I knew what it was, I started seeing it everywhere.

171
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,160
Speaker 0: And at PAX OZ, I saw it a lot compared to other places.

172
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,620
Speaker 0: I've seen it more there than anywhere else.

173
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,500
Speaker 1: Well, it's like once you see a bear in the woods, it's just bears everywhere.

174
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Card Fight Vanguard is some sort of CCG.

175
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,600
Speaker 0: I still don't know how to play it, but it has all sorts of licensed properties amongst its cards.

176
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's multiple anime, there's a manga, there's a live action.

177
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,260
Speaker 0: But it's like you can get Hatsune Miku cards up in there and shit.

178
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,320
Speaker 0: It's pretty crazy.

179
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:01,259
Speaker 1: You know what that is?

180
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,719
Speaker 1: It is what the Penny Arcade fighting system game was supposed to be.

181
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,959
Speaker 0: I guess, I don't know.

182
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,792
Speaker 0: But it's sort of... The system has like, you know, gigantic numbers, so it's a lot closer to like Yu-Gi-Oh!

183
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:14,654
Speaker 0: or some JRPG, where it's like, "5,000 damage,

184
00:08:14,714 --> 00:08:14,956
Speaker 0: whoa!".

185
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:15,802
Speaker 0: So,

186
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:30,440
Speaker 1: my news is that you guys, if you care at all about this sort of industry, as opposed to just the fandom or whatever, but if you care about the industry, pay attention to this Vanguard thing, because it's got tentacles touching every aspect of anime and gaming in a big way.

187
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:37,620
Speaker 0: I feel like this is one of those things that's pretty big and nerdery outside the US, and is a little bit in the US, but is growing everywhere quite a bit.

188
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think this is going to be simmering for a while, and then it's going to blindside a lot of people down the road.

189
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, this doesn't seem like one of those things that just like, you know, some side, you know, deal.

190
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,560
Speaker 0: It seems like a slow, low bubbler that just takes a long time to boil.

191
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,585
Speaker 1: So, the artist of Yu-Gi-Oh!

192
00:08:54,906 --> 00:09:00,760
Speaker 1: R manga is doing a Vanguard manga called Card Fight Vanguard.

193
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,139
Speaker 0: That's what the name of the thing is.

194
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,720
Speaker 1: And Vertical licensed it to release it in the US.

195
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:07,880
Speaker 0: I guess they've recognized that it's gaining popularity.

196
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,762
Speaker 1: Exactly.

197
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:15,700
Speaker 1: If Vertical licensed it and has noticed Vanguard enough to bother with this, then there's something going on, so keep an eye on all this business.

198
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,357
Speaker 0: But if you want to play a card game...

199
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:18,200
Speaker 1: Don't play this game.

200
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,640
Speaker 0: Play Netrunner.

201
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:19,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, Netrunner's your game.

202
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,779
Speaker 0: Don't play Card Fight.

203
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,660
Speaker 1: Well, first comment on Anime News Network.

204
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,660
Speaker 1: That's a really unusual grab.

205
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,005
Speaker 0: For Vertical?

206
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,260
Speaker 0: I mean, Vertical, you know, they're changing their game anyway.

207
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,120
Speaker 1: I wouldn't be surprised if Vertical was paid to license this.

208
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,139
Speaker 1: What the fuck is this?

209
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,325
Speaker 0: See?

210
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:35,873
Speaker 0: See?

211
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:36,380
Speaker 0: No one knows.

212
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:37,159
Speaker 0: I know what it is.

213
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,859
Speaker 0: We just know more than those people.

214
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,520
Speaker 1: So yeah, thank you, dude, for doing that panel at our gong show about Vanguard.

215
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,480
Speaker 1: So now we notice all the bears shitting in the woods.

216
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:48,959
Speaker 0: So everyone knows this already, right?

217
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,133
Speaker 0: But, you know, Miyazaki retired and everyone was like, "Oh, he's not actually going to

218
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:52,499
Speaker 0: retire.".

219
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,299
Speaker 0: We were totally right.

220
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:54,132
Speaker 1: Yeah, well...

221
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:55,316
Speaker 0: He's making another manga.

222
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:55,520
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

223
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure he said he was retiring from filmmaking.

224
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,288
Speaker 0: Sure, whatever.

225
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,180
Speaker 0: He's making another manga.

226
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,960
Speaker 0: I don't think he's made a manga that I know of since Nashika.

227
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,659
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe he's made some small ones, but he hasn't made, like, a major one since then.

228
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:08,979
Speaker 0: And that was forever ago.

229
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:16,560
Speaker 0: And the new one is all samurai and awesome, and there's some pictures of it, and people are freaking out when they see the pictures, because, oh my gosh, how could you not freak out looking at that?

230
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:17,860
Speaker 0: I freaked out also.

231
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:20,740
Speaker 0: And then people are basically just dying.

232
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:27,857
Speaker 0: I've seen tweets that are along the lines of, "All I want to do is read each page as he writes

233
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:27,998
Speaker 0: it."

234
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:34,880
Speaker 0: "I am only continuing to live my life so I can read this manga," and such and such.

235
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,129
Speaker 0: And... okay.

236
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:37,940
Speaker 0: Sure.

237
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, really interesting.

238
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:41,197
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

239
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,060
Speaker 0: It's just, you know, that's the news.

240
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,340
Speaker 0: Because if you haven't heard that news, what rock were you living under?

241
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, guys, you shouldn't get your news from Geek Nights.

242
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,860
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

243
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:01,360
Speaker 1: So, I did that Gemfire livestream.

244
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,619
Speaker 1: That's not my thing of the day, but because of it, I kind of got curious about Gemfire, because it's a really simple SNES game.

245
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:13,640
Speaker 1: It's in the genre of there's a map with a bunch of numbers, and you move guys around.

246
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,039
Speaker 1: Very Nobunga's Ambition.

247
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:19,959
Speaker 1: Yeah.

248
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:35,540
Speaker 1: So, it's that kind of game, and it's pretty simple, but there's all this stuff in the game that as a kid I noticed, like all these icons that never made sense and weren't really explained, and all these hereditary things and complicated crests.

249
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:42,040
Speaker 1: The game had this really sort of apparent depth that had no bearing on the actual game.

250
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:44,999
Speaker 0: Like all the lore I never read.

251
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is in the SNES era where there was no lore to read.

252
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:50,660
Speaker 0: There's no memory to put any lore.

253
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the game was it, and there wasn't a supplementary thing that I could ever find.

254
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:17,339
Speaker 1: So, after doing the stream, I went to Game Facts, and good fucking god, I think Gemfire for the SNES wins the award for the most ridiculously complex bullshit that could come up in gameplay, but will never actually matter, and I can't believe people took the time to figure this shit out.

255
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:19,380
Speaker 1: They've had a while.

256
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,600
Speaker 1: So, here's an example.

257
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,320
Speaker 1: Characters, you know, you have vassals and lords and people and families and whatever.

258
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,331
Speaker 1: Characters have an age.

259
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:28,180
Speaker 1: It's pretty arbitrary.

260
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,855
Speaker 1: Most of the guys are like in their 20s, 30s, 40s.

261
00:12:30,895 --> 00:12:31,760
Speaker 1: Some of them are in their teens.

262
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:33,299
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter at all.

263
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:35,439
Speaker 1: The game progresses through time.

264
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:37,407
Speaker 1: Turns out, the characters age.

265
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,819
Speaker 1: Like, their age goes up on their birthday every year.

266
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:42,439
Speaker 1: They can die of old age.

267
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:44,320
Speaker 0: The game will never be that long.

268
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:53,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you suck at this game, and you somehow beat it, and it takes you forever, it might take you maybe six or seven years to beat the game.

269
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,000
Speaker 0: No one will die unless they die in battle.

270
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, six, seven, maybe like ten or eleven years.

271
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,639
Speaker 1: Oh, they can't die in battle, for one.

272
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,740
Speaker 1: So, six to ten years maybe to beat this game.

273
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,919
Speaker 0: Shows how much I play Gemfire.

274
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:11,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, if someone makes it to the age of 75, every year from that time on, there's a random chance they'll die.

275
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:25,280
Speaker 1: And if the head of a family dies, then the crest of the family may change because someone in the family who is an heir to the throne, and there's icons that tell you who's the heir to what, can become the head of the family.

276
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,659
Speaker 0: Maybe you're supposed to play, and instead of playing just to win, just play to roleplay, and just slow roll it.

277
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, here's where this gets crazy.

278
00:13:36,722 --> 00:14:04,018
Speaker 1: If you contrive a situation such that the heir to a family, the final heir to a family, is banished, or dies of old age, then the family disbands, and every person who's the highest rank in each property, like every person who controls one or more of the realms that you have control over, their family crest appears on the map, and they're now a new family that they're the head of.

279
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:18,660
Speaker 1: So you can break a family up with ridiculous contrived bullshit, form brand new families that have all their own lore and all their own shit, and then win the game with that, and there seems to be a dedicated subset of people on the internet who do this for fun.

280
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,400
Speaker 0: Alright.

281
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,479
Speaker 0: So, look at the-- Why don't you get one of their save games?

282
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:28,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, read through these game facts, and then look at the game, and try to reconcile in your brain between the two.

283
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:29,511
Speaker 0: Okay.

284
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:30,279
Speaker 0: So, thing of the day, huh?

285
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,607
Speaker 0: Alright, Demeter.

286
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:32,800
Speaker 0: What's Demeter all about?

287
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:34,279
Speaker 1: Uh, the harvest and such?

288
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know why they chose this name.

289
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,836
Speaker 1: Uh, what do you mean "they"?

290
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,977
Speaker 0: So, if you go to-- The Greeks?

291
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,905
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's one thing-- The Greeks?

292
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:43,297
Speaker 1: You're saying why the Greeks-- No.

293
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:43,775
Speaker 0: Okay.

294
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,140
Speaker 0: My thing of the day chose this name.

295
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,920
Speaker 0: So, uh, you know, I'm not a fan of perfumes.

296
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,180
Speaker 0: There's a lot of places in New York that sell them to tourists, right?

297
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,020
Speaker 0: And it's like, you just want to make yourself smell like something?

298
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,160
Speaker 0: It's like, it's kind of weird.

299
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,880
Speaker 0: I mean, there are some perfumes that smell holy shit good.

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,860
Speaker 0: Well, I like-- And I enjoy smelling them, but I think it's kind of stupid to spend a zillion dollars on a good smell when you can just get a thing that smells good, like a food.

301
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,040
Speaker 1: Or get a cheaper perfume that smells the same, because no one can actually tell.

302
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want to smell like strawberries, just rub some strawberries on your ass.

303
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,160
Speaker 1: Oh, because that doesn't hold as-- anyway.

304
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:28,920
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this website, demeterfragrance.com, is a website where you can buy perfumes, gels, oils, things that smell, right?

305
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:34,100
Speaker 0: And they have, you know, typical, you know, kind of things, right?

306
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,040
Speaker 0: But all of their smells seem to be branded in some way.

307
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:48,360
Speaker 0: So, for example, right now they're advertising the Nigel Barker Signature Fragrance Collection, which has smells such as "Nigel Barker," which I guess smells like a dog?

308
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:48,667
Speaker 0: Wow.

309
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,560
Speaker 0: Or-- Right, Times Square, that's supposed to smell like tourists, I don't know.

310
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,400
Speaker 1: I imagine it smells like some combination of urine and tourists.

311
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:09,200
Speaker 0: Sure, but they have lots of, you know, in addition to all these normal smells like cranberry lotion, not too weird, they've got things like fuzzy navel, or pizza, or pumpkin pie.

312
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:14,859
Speaker 0: So it's pretty much that, you know, what's that soda company that always has-- Joan Soda?

313
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,699
Speaker 0: It's the Joan Soda of perfume.

314
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:27,519
Speaker 0: Oh my god, remember that year where we got that Joan Soda and we were like-- They've got Hello Kitty perfumes, they've got Elvira, Mistress of the Dark perfumes, Tootsie Roll, officially licensed perfumes.

315
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,800
Speaker 0: I guess if you want to smell like a Tootsie Roll, or a slice of pizza, or who knows?

316
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,759
Speaker 0: So this shit is cray cray.

317
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:44,960
Speaker 0: I kind of want-- I don't want to pay any money for any of this, but they do have 100% money back guaranteed, no questions asked, so maybe I should buy some, smell them, and send them back just because I want to see what they smell like.

318
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:49,440
Speaker 0: I'm sure we will-- I think it's like the Jelly Belly of perfumes.

319
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,920
Speaker 1: I'm sure we'll encounter some of this at convention dealers' rooms at some point.

320
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,280
Speaker 0: They're promoting their candy cane truffle, so seasonal.

321
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,162
Speaker 1: Huh.

322
00:16:56,564 --> 00:17:01,699
Speaker 1: You know what, actually, you've got to cross-brand that with Adventure Time, and make all the different princesses.

323
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,720
Speaker 1: Smell-- oh man.

324
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, I tell you what.

325
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,858
Speaker 0: What does Lumpy Space Princess smell like?

326
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:09,819
Speaker 1: I know one old man who's going to be first in line.

327
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:12,977
Speaker 0: He's like, "Ah, I smell even more like Lumpy Space Princess than I usually

328
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:13,098
Speaker 0: do."

329
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:15,134
Speaker 0: With his Lumpy Space Princess perfume.

330
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:21,898
Speaker 1: So because my Thing of the Day was tedious and it's a lot of text, I have a secondary Thing of the Day for you people with short attention spans.

331
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:26,039
Speaker 1: It's a nine-second video of the most terrible toaster in the world.

332
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:26,976
Speaker 0: Okay.

333
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,860
Speaker 0: In a moment.

334
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,280
Speaker 0: The Book Club book is-- Aye-da-doo, by William Gibson.

335
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:33,570
Speaker 0: A classic.

336
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,240
Speaker 0: I didn't even start.

337
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,510
Speaker 0: Really?

338
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,748
Speaker 0: You're going to go to Istanbul.

339
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:36,760
Speaker 0: I'll have plenty of time to read it.

340
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,846
Speaker 1: I'll have it done on-- Already.

341
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,100
Speaker 0: You had it done already.

342
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,940
Speaker 1: I know, but it's been a long time since I read this book, so I'm going to read it again.

343
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:43,528
Speaker 0: All right.

344
00:17:44,157 --> 00:17:44,400
Speaker 0: Anyway.

345
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,238
Speaker 0: So anyway, we can do the episode real soon.

346
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:50,700
Speaker 1: then, instead of having a huge, long time between the-- Yeah, I don't know why we had such a long time before.

347
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,500
Speaker 1: I can't imagine what happened there.

348
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:56,300
Speaker 0: Anyway, maybe we could even do a Book Club book every Thursday episode.

349
00:17:58,026 --> 00:17:58,739
Speaker 0: No, won't happen.

350
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,106
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm at a moment.

351
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,680
Speaker 1: Watch our live streams, watch our videos.

352
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,460
Speaker 1: Come see us at MagFest, which is coming up real soon.

353
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:12,720
Speaker 0: No shows next week because I will, ironically-- There will be a lack of shows between now and December.

354
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:21,460
Speaker 0: There's going to be more than one show, but less than full number of shows because holidays in the United States-- And then MagFest and then recovery from MagFest.

355
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:21,981
Speaker 0: Right.

356
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:25,959
Speaker 0: In January, there will be a return to full showness until-- Full show consequences.

357
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:27,199
Speaker 0: Until PAX East.

358
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:34,317
Speaker 1: But I'm going to be, ironically, in Turkey over Thanksgiving, so I'm going to miss out on all the--.

359
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,860
Speaker 1: --Thanksgivica that's going on because it's really not a holiday anywhere, but North America.

360
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,460
Speaker 0: That's a shame.

361
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:40,650
Speaker 1: It's fine.

362
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,237
Speaker 1: It'll be worth it.

363
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,260
Speaker 1: It's going to be in chill time over there in Turkey.

364
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:43,912
Speaker 1: You can hang out.

365
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:46,100
Speaker 0: Enjoy your no-turkey eating.

366
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:47,828
Speaker 1: You know what?

367
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,900
Speaker 0: I think-- You're going to go find an American hotel that will serve a Thanksgiving dinner?

368
00:18:52,140 --> 00:19:10,619
Speaker 1: I think as I'm sitting at a five-star restaurant overlooking the Bosphorus, drinking wine, and just enjoying the silent, breathtaking view of one of the most historic and notable rivers in the world, eating the fanciest, finest food with my own sommelier, I think I'll be okay.

369
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:22,320
Speaker 0: I think I'll be in my apartment gazing out over the most important city of the world, the capital of the world, eating Thanksgiving leftovers, which are more delicious than anything in any restaurant ever.

370
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,639
Speaker 1: Yes, and you know what I'm not going to miss?

371
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,958
Speaker 1: Thanksgiving leftovers.

372
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,859
Speaker 1: That shit's going to be waiting for me when I get home.

373
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:27,989
Speaker 0: Will it?

374
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:28,799
Speaker 0: From where?

375
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:29,820
Speaker 1: Up, Emily.

376
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:31,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, where's she going to get it from?

377
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,454
Speaker 1: Thanksgivings.

378
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,100
Speaker 0: Which Thanksgiving's she going to?

379
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,280
Speaker 1: People other than you have relatives.

380
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:37,438
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, sure.

381
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:41,000
Speaker 0: But they don't have the same leftovers that I have.

382
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,019
Speaker 1: What is this?

383
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,759
Speaker 1: Okay, I got distracted by-- I'm watching drama in a thread related to a convention that's popping up in my Google Glass.

384
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:49,418
Speaker 0: Why are you doing that?

385
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,260
Speaker 1: Because it keeps popping up, and it's drama.

386
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:52,220
Speaker 0: Okay.

387
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,060
Speaker 1: It's funny drama.

388
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:53,800
Speaker 1: All right.

389
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,020
Speaker 1: So yeah, Scott and I have each seen an anime that the other one has not seen.

390
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,419
Speaker 0: Right, we do one anime each.

391
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:04,273
Speaker 0: That way, the episode's real easy-like, and we don't have to sit here going, "All right, what have we both

392
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:04,556
Speaker 0: seen?".

393
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:04,887
Speaker 0: "All

394
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:05,020
Speaker 0: right.".

395
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,039
Speaker 1: We were going to both do the thing that Scott saw, but-- But Rin didn't watch it.

396
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:10,880
Speaker 1: I went-- I fell asleep instead of watching it last night.

397
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:11,254
Speaker 0: Good job.

398
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:12,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was tired.

399
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,238
Speaker 0: You even finished gaming early.

400
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,080
Speaker 0: We had plenty of time.

401
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,559
Speaker 1: I know, but you know what I did instead?

402
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,099
Speaker 1: I played Wizards and Warriors.

403
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:18,999
Speaker 0: You just kept playing it?

404
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:22,140
Speaker 1: I'm going to livestream Wizards and Warriors now that-- How much did you get, far?

405
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:24,380
Speaker 1: Not much further than I got before.

406
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,879
Speaker 1: That fucking lava, fuck that.

407
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:28,640
Speaker 0: You need to get the lava boot.

408
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,819
Speaker 1: When I play through again, I'm not getting that goddamn horn.

409
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:32,238
Speaker 0: The horn?

410
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,000
Speaker 0: The thing is, in the next level, you're going to want that horn, because it reveals the secrets.

411
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:39,540
Speaker 1: I am keeping my boots, because the boots are better than anything.

412
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,900
Speaker 0: If you reveal the secrets, you can get the magic wand, whatever thing.

413
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,639
Speaker 1: Don't care.

414
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:44,199
Speaker 0: All right.

415
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,760
Speaker 0: Don't care.

416
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,860
Speaker 1: My knife skills will see me through the night.

417
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,540
Speaker 0: Mad treasures.

418
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,260
Speaker 1: That game sucks, dogs.

419
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,100
Speaker 1: It is mad hard and not fun, but anyway.

420
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,560
Speaker 1: So, your anime.

421
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:55,967
Speaker 0: My anime.

422
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,000
Speaker 0: So, this is anime I've been thinking about watching, because it's about bikes.

423
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:05,520
Speaker 0: It's called Yoamushi Pedal, which is about bicycling, and Yoamushi, Emily says, means weakling.

424
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,300
Speaker 0: So, it's like weakling pedal, right?

425
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:08,659
Speaker 0: What's it about?

426
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:10,759
Speaker 0: It's about an otaku.

427
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:12,360
Speaker 0: He goes to high school.

428
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,960
Speaker 0: He's an otaku who has no friends, but he's not a bad guy.

429
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,679
Speaker 0: He's not that guy.

430
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,900
Speaker 0: He just likes animes and likes mangas and likes capsule toys and such and such.

431
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:26,709
Speaker 0: He likes to sing anime theme songs, but he doesn't have any friends, even though he's not socially inept.

432
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:40,439
Speaker 0: He's just introverted, and he goes to high school, and he bikes to high school, right, on his stupid, you know, one-gear old lady bike, and when he gets there, he tries to join an anime club.

433
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,180
Speaker 0: Anime club's closed.

434
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:43,099
Speaker 0: Not enough nerds.

435
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:43,464
Speaker 1: Ha.

436
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,039
Speaker 0: No nerds, and he was totally, all he wanted to do, it was like us going to RIT.

437
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,360
Speaker 0: He's like, "Finally, there's going to be some nerds.

438
00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:50,420
Speaker 0: I'll have friends.

439
00:21:50,503 --> 00:21:50,878
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

440
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,229
Speaker 0: No.".

441
00:21:53,022 --> 00:22:11,540
Speaker 0: But, much like Takumi of Initial D, right, in that Takumi magically gained car racing skills by delivering tofu, this kid, his name is Onoda Sakamichi, right, he biked all the way to Akihabara every week on his shitty bike, right?

442
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,900
Speaker 1: Oh, and does he have the cadence of the gods?

443
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,918
Speaker 0: He has the cadence, because basically, when he was very, he got the bike when he was like in fourth grade or some shit, right?

444
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:29,743
Speaker 0: And his parents didn't want him to go very fast, so his mom changed his front gear to a small one, thinking, "Oh, he'll just go to the train station and then take the train to

445
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:30,300
Speaker 0: Akihabara.".

446
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:30,536
Speaker 0: Nope.

447
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,239
Speaker 0: He biked with the tiny gear all the way there and back really fast, so he had the cadence of the gods.

448
00:22:37,760 --> 00:23:01,978
Speaker 0: And when he gets to school, there's a bike racing club that Siri is biz, and there's a nice girl who works at the bike shop that her brother runs and her family owns who used to go to the school, and all these people, they notice him, because they see him biking up the back hill of the school, which is the crazy hill, and he was biking up it comfortably while singing an anime theme song, and someone saw him do that and was like, "Whoa,

449
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:02,399
Speaker 0: snap!".

450
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:10,880
Speaker 0: And then, you know, they discover that he likes, he's good at biking, and he discovers he likes biking, and it's the most generic anime in the entire universe.

451
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:16,340
Speaker 0: I have never seen an anime more average and generic than this anime.

452
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:19,300
Speaker 1: Is it the initial D of biking without music?

453
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,700
Speaker 0: It is the initial D of biking with better animation and no music.

454
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,958
Speaker 1: Like, "Oh, look at his dual-braking technique, front-back, he's

455
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:27,359
Speaker 1: alternating.".

456
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,360
Speaker 0: That hasn't happened yet.

457
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,652
Speaker 0: So far, it's been like, "Raise your seat up, oh snap,".

458
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:37,148
Speaker 0: or, "I installed a front derailleur on your bike, oh my god, I changed gears,".

459
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,976
Speaker 0: or, "Get behind me, the wind is

460
00:23:39,037 --> 00:23:39,338
Speaker 0: coming.".

461
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:41,796
Speaker 0: All that, right?

462
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,768
Speaker 1: Just like initial D, "Wow, he's doing a drift, yes, his car is a front wheeled drive,

463
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:47,360
Speaker 1: therefore.".

464
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:56,480
Speaker 0: Now, the only thing I can say about this show that actually makes it a little bit not as good as initial D, besides lack of music, is the pacing is slower, right?

465
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:05,920
Speaker 0: There was just a whole episode where all they did was bike to catch up to a yakuza driving in his rice car so that they could throw a cigarette butt back into the window.

466
00:24:06,461 --> 00:24:07,960
Speaker 0: That was an entire episode.

467
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,217
Speaker 0: The show moves so slowly, right?

468
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,980
Speaker 0: It's like in the opener, it's like you see him with a helmet, and he's got a new road bike, and not his old lady bike.

469
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,140
Speaker 0: You know the show's going there, right?

470
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,199
Speaker 0: To where he's going to join the bike club and race, and he's going to make friends with all these people, right?

471
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:36,138
Speaker 0: But I'm already on episode four, and he hasn't even met more than two bike club people, and he's not in the bike club, and he doesn't have a helmet, and he doesn't have a new bike yet, and he's just like, "Oh my god, this thing's gonna-".

472
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:38,740
Speaker 1: Well, there are 12 episodes announced so far.

473
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,040
Speaker 0: Right, well, so far there's seven on Crunchyroll, so this thing better pick up the goddamn pace, because it's not going anywhere right now.

474
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,680
Speaker 1: Uh-oh, episode eight is entitled Sprint Climb, get some uphill action.

475
00:24:50,261 --> 00:25:06,240
Speaker 0: So I wish it would move along faster, it might be more interesting, but I think what it comes down to is because this show is just so exactly average anime, 100%, not bad, not good, just cookie cutter anime- So sea level anime.

476
00:25:06,762 --> 00:25:08,880
Speaker 0: To the maximum, it is the cookie cutter anime.

477
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:11,519
Speaker 0: If you care about bikes, you should watch it.

478
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:16,167
Speaker 0: If you don't care about bikes, and you don't wanna start caring about bikes, don't watch it.

479
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,020
Speaker 0: So here's my question.

480
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,079
Speaker 0: It's not worth your time.

481
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:20,660
Speaker 1: Is it accurate, at least, the bike stuff?

482
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,240
Speaker 0: It is 100% realistic, no supernatural nonsense whatsoever in terms of bikes.

483
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,740
Speaker 0: The only thing that is not accurate is that some of the bikes, they change the brand names.

484
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,895
Speaker 0: Like the guy with the Trek, it says like,

485
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:31,996
Speaker 0: "Trac.".

486
00:25:33,182 --> 00:25:36,777
Speaker 0: And the guy with the Scott bike, it says,

487
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:37,299
Speaker 0: "Skult.".

488
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:38,518
Speaker 1: You know what that tells me?

489
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:45,259
Speaker 1: It tells me that this is not going to be, or never was as popular as, Initial D. Because Initial D was the cars.

490
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,480
Speaker 1: From day one.

491
00:25:47,501 --> 00:25:55,060
Speaker 0: If you ... Clearly, whoever made this is a bike nerd, though, right?

492
00:25:55,241 --> 00:25:56,358
Speaker 1: You know what would be a good thing to do?

493
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:02,020
Speaker 1: Make a super cut of all the bike advice from this show, and turn that into a, "Listen, shithead.

494
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,213
Speaker 1: Here's how to use your goddamn

495
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:03,477
Speaker 1: bike.".

496
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:04,099
Speaker 0: Yeah.

497
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:06,676
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

498
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:07,299
Speaker 0: All right.

499
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:07,697
Speaker 0: But yeah.

500
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:15,960
Speaker 1: So Emily and I saw the last screening in Manhattan of The Wind Rises, Hayao Miyazaki's last movie.

501
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:18,020
Speaker 0: Quote last, last movie.

502
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,460
Speaker 1: We'll do a full review later.

503
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,239
Speaker 1: Emily and I have seen it.

504
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,360
Speaker 1: Scott hasn't yet.

505
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,060
Speaker 0: I'll definitely see it before I die.

506
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,019
Speaker 1: The one thing I can say is that, as we say with every anime movie that isn't just a Pokemon One Piece sequel.

507
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:29,859
Speaker 0: You should see it.

508
00:26:29,981 --> 00:26:30,440
Speaker 1: No matter what.

509
00:26:31,763 --> 00:26:32,960
Speaker 0: There aren't too many of these.

510
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,560
Speaker 1: If you like anime, you should watch every anime movie that comes out.

511
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,392
Speaker 0: Except for the Pokemon ones.

512
00:26:36,982 --> 00:26:37,860
Speaker 0: And maybe even those.

513
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,200
Speaker 1: Every anime movie that comes out that does not have a number in the title.

514
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:44,360
Speaker 0: One Piece movie 20.

515
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,279
Speaker 1: Though even then, there's the one that was done by Hosoda that we reviewed, The Baron Omatsuri.

516
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,739
Speaker 0: Which I didn't really like that much.

517
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,020
Speaker 0: Anyway.

518
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:52,039
Speaker 1: I didn't like it either.

519
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,940
Speaker 1: But it was memorable.

520
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,318
Speaker 0: I like One Piece TV more than that.

521
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:57,359
Speaker 1: You think that.

522
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,299
Speaker 1: Try watching it again.

523
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:58,940
Speaker 0: That's true.

524
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:00,931
Speaker 0: But the thing is, One Piece manga, it's like.

525
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:03,800
Speaker 0: I liked it when it moved along, and I didn't like it when it didn't move along.

526
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,440
Speaker 1: I just want happy pirates that move quickly.

527
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, that that happened in parts of the TV and the manga.

528
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,960
Speaker 1: So the wind rises.

529
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:20,539
Speaker 1: If you don't know anything about it, it is a huge departure from what any casual fan of anime would expect a Miyazaki movie to be.

530
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:21,820
Speaker 0: It is about.

531
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:22,136
Speaker 0: OK.

532
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,540
Speaker 0: It is not even similar to Poco Rosso or anything.

533
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:31,320
Speaker 1: So it shares some similarities to Poco Rosso, but it's historical drama.

534
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:32,520
Speaker 1: It is a fiction.

535
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,680
Speaker 0: So it's Poco Rosso plus Grave of the Fireflies.

536
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:38,380
Speaker 1: This is a fictionalization of the life of a real person.

537
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:49,559
Speaker 1: OK, controversial person, Jiro Horikoshi, a fighter jet or fighter jet fighter plane designer for Japan, Imperial Japan, World War Two.

538
00:27:50,821 --> 00:28:00,620
Speaker 1: You know, the guy whose prototypes led to the development of the zero and obviously controversial for all the reasons that should be eminently obvious.

539
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,339
Speaker 0: Well, he's can't be.

540
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,580
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, obviously.

541
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:06,320
Speaker 0: But I mean, is the guy who designed the F-15 controversial?

542
00:28:07,345 --> 00:28:08,380
Speaker 0: So is it any different?

543
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
Speaker 1: That's kind of what this movie is about, actually, right?

544
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,095
Speaker 1: Because the story of the movie is that he has this dream as a kid.

545
00:28:16,637 --> 00:28:30,600
Speaker 1: and the dream is about Giovanni Battista Caproni, Italiano, who basically did the same thing that Jiro did for Italy and World War One and made the Red Baron's plane.

546
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:34,920
Speaker 1: The running theme is that Caproni and Jiro both did the same thing.

547
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:46,940
Speaker 1: They ignored but were aware of the ramifications and uses of what they were building, the war machines they were building, because their dream was to make beautiful flying machines.

548
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:53,922
Speaker 1: And there is no way to make them except to make them for people who will use them for bad things.

549
00:28:54,425 --> 00:28:57,440
Speaker 0: What if you make them for people who will deliver the mail with them?

550
00:28:57,661 --> 00:29:01,499
Speaker 1: There weren't people like that who would give you the opportunity to make them.

551
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,140
Speaker 0: Oh, what about in France, L'Arpostare?

552
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, when did that happen?

553
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,959
Speaker 1: And where did the original planes come from?

554
00:29:10,546 --> 00:29:11,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just saying.

555
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,622
Speaker 1: Yeah.

556
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:13,760
Speaker 1: So the movie is beautiful.

557
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,760
Speaker 1: The movie, if I have to sell you on the movie.

558
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,320
Speaker 0: What Ghibli movie is not beautiful?

559
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,519
Speaker 0: Even stupid Earthies are beautiful.

560
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:29,020
Speaker 1: And one notable thing I want to bring up about it is that the soundscape, the foley, the sound design is is like something I've never heard before.

561
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,806
Speaker 1: I could never.

562
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,140
Speaker 0: How could that be possible?

563
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:37,939
Speaker 1: A sound that people all of the sound effects in this movie are humans doing the helicopter blade, helicopter blade, helicopter blade thing.

564
00:29:38,262 --> 00:29:38,545
Speaker 1: What?

565
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:39,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, literally.

566
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,540
Speaker 1: The sound effects are like when planes explode and things happen, it's people going.

567
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:46,848
Speaker 0: What?

568
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:48,459
Speaker 0: That sounds dumb.

569
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:50,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that can't be true.

570
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:50,561
Speaker 1: Yeah.

571
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:53,300
Speaker 1: So watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.

572
00:29:53,461 --> 00:29:55,400
Speaker 0: Did they filter it heavily to make it?

573
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,840
Speaker 1: They filtered it enough, but it is obvious that it is humans.

574
00:29:59,221 --> 00:30:07,240
Speaker 1: And there's a sort of undercurrent that is backed up both by the sound design and the way planes are drawn and the way people dream about planes.

575
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:09,640
Speaker 1: That planes, the planes there.

576
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,800
Speaker 0: Is the whole thing like someone reading a storybook?

577
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:12,305
Speaker 0: No.

578
00:30:12,325 --> 00:30:13,260
Speaker 0: And that's why it makes it?

579
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:13,802
Speaker 0: No.

580
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:16,360
Speaker 1: The plane is a literal, here is Japan.

581
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:17,780
Speaker 1: It starts with the Kanto earthquake.

582
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,960
Speaker 1: It ends with the end of his life, post World War Two.

583
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:27,780
Speaker 1: And it shows all the areas of Japan accurately, historically, accurately.

584
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,360
Speaker 1: And he is sort of floating through this world dreaming of making these planes.

585
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:40,558
Speaker 1: You could argue that the planes are literally, in a sense, made out of the blood of the bodies of the people who are killed by them.

586
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,080
Speaker 1: And the sound design being people and the planes being made of people kind of drives and drives and drives to this point.

587
00:30:50,424 --> 00:30:50,829
Speaker 0: I get it.

588
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:51,316
Speaker 1: And yeah.

589
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,680
Speaker 1: And there's something, Caproni says something, you know, the Italian designer to the effect of, see this plane?

590
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,420
Speaker 1: That's the beautiful plane I made that was used as a fighter, a bomber.

591
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:03,317
Speaker 1: None of them came back.

592
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:10,579
Speaker 1: Toward the end, you see the planes that Jiro designed that were used in World War Two, and he says the same thing.

593
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:11,638
Speaker 1: None of them came back.

594
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:14,359
Speaker 1: And that is what this movie is about.

595
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,960
Speaker 1: And I don't want to say anything else because it's a Miyazaki movie.

596
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:20,239
Speaker 1: There's no reason not to see it.

597
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:24,520
Speaker 1: But it is the most complex movie Miyazaki has ever made, in my opinion.

598
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,899
Speaker 1: And it was amazing and soul crushing at the same time.

599
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,681
Speaker 0: I wonder who did make that 15.

600
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,005
Speaker 0: Do you know?

601
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,161
Speaker 0: Is it a 15?

602
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:34,319
Speaker 0: Is it a person that we know?

603
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:35,436
Speaker 1: I don't know.

604
00:31:36,421 --> 00:31:36,642
Speaker 0: Right.

605
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:40,357
Speaker 1: But it's complicated because this the movie doesn't even like.

606
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:41,782
Speaker 1: Hitler is mentioned in this movie.

607
00:31:42,345 --> 00:31:49,160
Speaker 1: He meets at one point this German guy who fled from Germany and he has this whole conversation with the guys like Japan is going to explode.

608
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,320
Speaker 1: Germany is going to explode.

609
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,475
Speaker 1: None of this is going to end.

610
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:51,739
Speaker 1: well.

611
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:55,880
Speaker 1: And you see the rise of Imperial Japan and the rise of fascism.

612
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:58,520
Speaker 1: And it all just kind of rises around him.

613
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,840
Speaker 1: The wind rises.

614
00:32:00,342 --> 00:32:04,760
Speaker 1: You have no choice but to be blown over by it or to survive it and to survive it.

615
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:07,057
Speaker 1: You have to sort of go along with it.

616
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:15,139
Speaker 1: There's sort of this undercurrent implied that had he resisted this, the planes would have been made anyway by someone else.

617
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:17,040
Speaker 1: The wars would have happened anyway.

618
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:26,019
Speaker 1: And his choice was to die or make these dreams come true, even though those dreams will kill people, because the people will be killed anyway.

619
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,808
Speaker 1: The wind rises.

620
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:27,518
Speaker 1: You can't stop it.

621
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:36,885
Speaker 1: It's sort of undercurrent almost that the Kanto earthquake and the military, at least if you're in that position, you could equally inevitable from the position of an individual person.

622
00:32:37,107 --> 00:32:38,220
Speaker 0: Well, from that person.

623
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:38,461
Speaker 0: Right.

624
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:41,360
Speaker 0: There's someone else who could be ever could have done something right.

625
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,985
Speaker 0: But he couldn't.

626
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,860
Speaker 1: So it's a complex movie.

627
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,560
Speaker 1: And you should all see it.

628
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:53,041
Speaker 1: If you were fans of anime, we'll do a sort of deeper review once Scott's seen it, too, and maybe we'll do a three way, an awkward three way, like in our Burning Wheel game last night.

629
00:32:59,795 --> 00:33:01,920
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

630
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:07,224
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

635
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,080
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

636
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,469
Speaker 1: The party at this girl's house.

637
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,110
Speaker 0: I think we're cool because my stamps always help her out.

638
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,850
Speaker 0: She is fine, but her friends are kind of this and thatness.

639
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,530
Speaker 0: But with me, I better help her find her in her Katniss.

640
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,270
Speaker 0: So I dance with my manager Vance asking if I could just get a friendly payment in advance.

641
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,150
Speaker 0: He blows me off, so I scoffed on my smock, check the clock, take it off, check my wad, feeling soft.

642
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:19,649
Speaker 0: All I got is 5.45 and it's 5.45, got to get a whopper and a 40 right.

643
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:29,908
Speaker 0: Well, I got 5.45 and it's 5.45, got to get a whopper and a 40 right.
