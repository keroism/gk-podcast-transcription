1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,382
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday January 25th 2017.

2
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:16,372
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,793 --> 00:00:21,679
Speaker 0: the Sailor Moon s movie Also known as cats can't fall in love.

4
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:25,847
Speaker 0: Let's do this Just regular ass all right.

5
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:28,514
Speaker 0: so the Sailor Moon movies are.

6
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:30,400
Speaker 1: shouldn't you wait until the end to talk about this?

7
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:32,375
Speaker 0: beginning right now?

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,687
Speaker 0: All right fine.

9
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:38,693
Speaker 0: so speaking of cold and winter I went skiing recently because I got a big ski trip coming up.

10
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:39,295
Speaker 0: I'd worry.

11
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:48,528
Speaker 0: speaking of cold and winter I didn't even say woman is cold, but this woman this movie is the winter Christmas II Sailor Moon movie mm-hmm.

12
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:52,820
Speaker 0: I guess that's my tenuous link, so there's a road at Hunter Mountain called Claire's Way.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:00,079
Speaker 0: It's like this double black on the West Mountain And it's usually open even when all the other stuff on the West Mountain is closed because they make snow on it.

14
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:02,340
Speaker 0: So it was really crowded.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,560
Speaker 0: It was over the Martin Luther King Day holiday weekend and the lift on the front side of the mountain was super super crowded.

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,236
Speaker 0: you Had to wait like 10 minutes to ride it back up.

17
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:28,920
Speaker 0: So I wanted to start skiing off the back of the mountain so I could use the no-line lift because there's only pro stuff Back there, but the good snow was all on the front side of the mountain and Claire's Way is basically if there unless There's like nice fresh snow It's basically just an ice cliff like a really long and really steep ice cliff.

18
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:34,200
Speaker 0: So I go back there, and you know I've skied it before and it usually sucks, and it's hard.

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,550
Speaker 0: I slide around you almost die, so it's always really hard.

20
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I'll fall over a lot.

21
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:50,606
Speaker 0: It's just challenging I'll tire myself out hurt myself a little bit, so I went over there for the first time with my new skis and Yeah, the new skis are clearly superior.

22
00:01:50,987 --> 00:02:06,553
Speaker 0: so basically in situations where in the past despite being fully Traversing like facing directly parallel to the fall line going sideways across the mountain the old skis would shutter and sort of Slide down like I couldn't hold a line.

23
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:08,663
Speaker 0: I Just hold line like nothing.

24
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:10,894
Speaker 0: I could just ski down this thing like nothing.

25
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:20,996
Speaker 0: it felt so easy That I skied down this thing like three or four times And it was totally just like baby stuff, and then I thought wow did I just get better?

26
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:23,922
Speaker 0: is the snow just like Better?

27
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:28,919
Speaker 0: than I realized what's going on, but then like my third time down there were some other people skiing on it.

28
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:41,479
Speaker 0: every single one of them fell over had some sort of accent along the way except me and I started to realize this literally just my skis are that much better, and I should have bought better skis a long time ago.

29
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:44,428
Speaker 1: Money buys things.

30
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:51,703
Speaker 1: yup if I buy a more expensive car It'll go faster, but at the same time if I buy a better video card I'll get more frame.

31
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:54,292
Speaker 0: you shouldn't buy the better thing unless you know why.

32
00:02:54,312 --> 00:03:01,060
Speaker 0: you're buying a case in point a 1080 right like that's The best video card, but if you spend more money you get one of those quadro cards.

33
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,748
Speaker 1: No, you know what's not for gaming.

34
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:03,692
Speaker 1: You know what's not true?

35
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,260
Speaker 1: the more expensive anime.

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,037
Speaker 0: So speaking of anime it's anime day, and there's actually some really good news coming out.

37
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:16,964
Speaker 1: so for one It's anime season.

38
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:18,732
Speaker 1: like suddenly all these animes are coming out.

39
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:19,335
Speaker 1: It's time to watch.

40
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:22,110
Speaker 0: There's lots of good anime We got to catch up on like you're on ice.

41
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,096
Speaker 0: We know is great.

42
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:27,020
Speaker 0: There's a My hero academia or whatever is supposed to be super good.

43
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:39,073
Speaker 0: I've been watching anime again But little witch academia which you may recall was a 30-minute short that was made by studio trigger And then they kick-started another one, but I kick-started it, but I didn't see it.

44
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:39,876
Speaker 0: I kick-started it.

45
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:40,960
Speaker 0: never watched it as well.

46
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,817
Speaker 0: I only ever have seen so far the first original 30-minute special.

47
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:46,366
Speaker 0: Yes was Amazing.

48
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,479
Speaker 0: like it was a anime by itself.

49
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:49,623
Speaker 0: It was brilliant.

50
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:53,876
Speaker 0: the new the the kick-started one which was an hour long was according to everyone.

51
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,444
Speaker 0: I know who has seen it Equally amazing.

52
00:03:56,464 --> 00:04:01,880
Speaker 1: a studio trigger ever made something that was not even good at least good.

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,989
Speaker 0: I think B+ is the lowest they've ever gone.

54
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,179
Speaker 0: like B+ and up with these guys.

55
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:08,346
Speaker 0: So little.

56
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:18,430
Speaker 0: witch academia was getting a TV series Which is now airing in Japan and now we know something important the TV series Basically ignores the continuity.

57
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,180
Speaker 0: the two movies are in the same universe.

58
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:24,860
Speaker 0: These basically just reboot it same characters, but the movies didn't happen.

59
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:28,079
Speaker 1: That's good because it might be hard for you to get those movies to watch them.

60
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:36,043
Speaker 0: Well also more importantly those movies sort of took the main character through an entire arc and left her kind of being like you didn't See the second one.

61
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:36,565
Speaker 1: How do you know that?

62
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,237
Speaker 0: I know from what the first one and some stuff I'm reading in this article about the second one that this is the case.

63
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:43,924
Speaker 0: Mmm So the series.

64
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:57,890
Speaker 0: it's kind of like the opposite of what used to happen in the old days with like Tenchi Muyo or El Hazard where you'd get like this really condensed pretty good OAV and then they would make a longer Rebooted parallel TV series.

65
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,695
Speaker 0: that was just bad.

66
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:05,420
Speaker 0: here It looks like they had made a really great OAV and now they're making rebooting a really great TV show.

67
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:09,202
Speaker 1: Another new anime series is coming out This season.

68
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:10,506
Speaker 1: is it already started?

69
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:14,118
Speaker 1: the first episode is already on the c-roll and that is your pedal.

70
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:15,202
Speaker 1: season 2.

71
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:18,111
Speaker 0: Oh, man, I didn't even watch one all the way more biking.

72
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:21,863
Speaker 1: So well, there was actually I actually think it's technically season 3 Maybe whatever.

73
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:23,067
Speaker 1: It's the new season of your pedal.

74
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:24,311
Speaker 0: There's more of it.

75
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:30,278
Speaker 1: All right, there were some compilation movies, but there was also another movie that told a story of like this one race.

76
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:39,617
Speaker 1: and Basically this first episode of the new season Sort of like makes it so you don't need to watch that movie.

77
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:39,999
Speaker 1: It's right.

78
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:56,911
Speaker 1: It's like the first half of the episode is really just sort of hurrying up and Tying all these loose ends together from the end of what you've already seen so that it's sort of like hurrying up so it can get to New season new race, you know new people new everything, right?

79
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:00,420
Speaker 1: So it wasn't really a strong first episode.

80
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:09,860
Speaker 1: I guess the second half of it was a little bit better but it's like it's almost like they're just doing their paperwork like oh We got to take care of all this bullshit before we can actually start doing more bike racing.

81
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,674
Speaker 1: And I wish they would have just said yeah, fuck it.

82
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:17,420
Speaker 1: Just start Just leave you hanging on that.

83
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,750
Speaker 0: It'd be like whole bunch of crap.

84
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:21,733
Speaker 0: Okay.

85
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:22,637
Speaker 0: Now there's a car race.

86
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:23,560
Speaker 0: Yes car race.

87
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:25,175
Speaker 1: I wish they would have just been like, all right, fuck it.

88
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:25,478
Speaker 1: Let's go.

89
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:29,660
Speaker 1: But they did it as fast as they could be like half an episode, right?

90
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,048
Speaker 0: And also At this point, I think we reviewed it.

91
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:37,302
Speaker 0: I assume we talked about dragon half on geek night Right.

92
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:39,960
Speaker 1: So dragon half if you don't know is his old anime.

93
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:49,313
Speaker 1: There's only got a couple episodes and the legend is that the person who made it went to jail for being a pedophile Which is surprisingly difficult to do in Japan where it's scarily.

94
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:51,160
Speaker 0: I am dubious of that story.

95
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:55,360
Speaker 0: It's scarily to the story that Luke Morgan kept telling everybody at the club.

96
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,166
Speaker 1: The point is dragon half did not complete.

97
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:58,591
Speaker 1: only a few episodes made and then it was.

98
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:01,040
Speaker 1: it just sort of ended without ending.

99
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:01,588
Speaker 1: It just sort of.

100
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,198
Speaker 1: there were no more.

101
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:06,040
Speaker 1: But there is a manga that this anime was based upon.

102
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:14,213
Speaker 1: it's never been available in English to my knowledge, but now it will be and It does not contain any such pedophile things.

103
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:21,197
Speaker 0: It is a now I can point out Thing that was like a rumor someone told at RIT.

104
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:22,663
Speaker 1: It was a rumor.

105
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:23,828
Speaker 1: someone told cuz.

106
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:26,216
Speaker 0: alright, so I have the internet in front of me.

107
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:30,733
Speaker 0: the mangaka Has never been in trouble as far as I can tell.

108
00:07:30,894 --> 00:07:35,633
Speaker 0: Alright, so Let's go to see who made who worked on the anime.

109
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:44,560
Speaker 1: The point is it's a cute funny Humorous fantasy series involving a girl who is half dragon her mom who is a whole dragon.

110
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:47,710
Speaker 1: This guy she's in love with was like a dragon Slayer.

111
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:55,203
Speaker 1: dragon slayers name is dick saucer and there's little slimes and It's cute and funny.

112
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:59,435
Speaker 0: Yeah, I cannot find my breathing fire-breathing dragons.

113
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:04,234
Speaker 0: I Cannot find anything like what you described.

114
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:05,238
Speaker 1: All right pop powder.

115
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:05,660
Speaker 1: funny funny.

116
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:11,220
Speaker 0: That one time I think that I think that you you have you have brought up nothing but slander here time ago.

117
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:18,680
Speaker 0: but anyway dragon half Was dumb and cute and it was just like a cult classic at a lot of anime clubs.

118
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:21,320
Speaker 0: I always really liked it cuz it was just there wasn't much.

119
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:28,391
Speaker 1: I think the fact that it has so few episodes is what makes it work cuz like if you kept going with it for a While, you know, it's sort of like all right.

120
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:34,580
Speaker 1: your cute funny fantasy isn't as good as Keep going with it because the manga has never come out in English.

121
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,513
Speaker 1: Also, look at that art for that manga looks way different than anime.

122
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:38,960
Speaker 0: It's all coming out.

123
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,149
Speaker 0: You're gonna get two three volumes for like 20 bucks each.

124
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:55,239
Speaker 0: That is the entirety of the dragon half manga And it looks like it's just gonna be make the dragon half girl goes on a quest to defeat the demon Lord as a to Death and get a potion that'll turn a human.

125
00:08:55,741 --> 00:09:02,864
Speaker 0: She can sex up dick saucer and we saw glimpses of that in the original anime and now we'll get to read about it in Full detail.

126
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:10,555
Speaker 0: Hey, I guess it was weird because I remember at RIT This had a mythological status partly just for the fact that it was like the anime.

127
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:18,640
Speaker 0: the rumor that I just talked about It was ridiculously popular and no one knew why it never like nothing ever got brought over in America.

128
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:20,585
Speaker 0: Now we're just gonna get to read it.

129
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:25,371
Speaker 1: which kind of excited about this one of those things people know about it know about it And everyone else doesn't know.

130
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:27,523
Speaker 0: I'm feeling dumb.

131
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,720
Speaker 0: light Fantasy esque stuff like you should link to the pop power.

132
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:35,620
Speaker 0: Like I kind of just watch all the slayers that's come out.

00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:08,034
Speaker 1: I can't imagine it was.

146
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:09,600
Speaker 1: maybe there's some super fan out there.

147
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:10,122
Speaker 0: Yep.

148
00:10:10,182 --> 00:10:10,504
Speaker 0: There we go.

149
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:12,875
Speaker 0: It looks a lot like the slayers SNES game.

150
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:24,644
Speaker 0: No, that's cute anyway, but anyway things Of the day.

151
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:25,606
Speaker 0: you got a thing of the day.

152
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,108
Speaker 1: It's sort of a thing a day.

153
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:34,757
Speaker 1: So, uh You know, I've been trying to not suck at photography for some years still suck.

154
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:45,480
Speaker 1: It's not easy But a lot of times it's like once you learn something and I learned it from YouTube mostly Which is a great place to learn about photography actually.

155
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:53,360
Speaker 1: But you know once you learn something and you see people who don't know it and it's just like ah But you can't teach them all of it every time, right?

156
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,514
Speaker 1: It's like you see someone not knowing and you try to you can't?

157
00:10:56,735 --> 00:11:04,498
Speaker 1: it's like you can't teach them Right and you get that feeling you get when someone dies in the first Goomba But you can't teach them how to play Mario because it would take too long and they don't want to hear that shit.

158
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:32,620
Speaker 1: But I also see a lot of people who do legitimately want to learn right and they don't necessarily want to learn it As much even as much as I've learned it which isn't much and they definitely don't want to learn it as much as like a professional But they want to learn it enough to her like, you know They can use their camera to help in their projects that they're you know doing whether it's because they had kids and they're taking photos Of them or taking photos of their arts or they're making videos for YouTube or whatever and they have to learn some amount.

159
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:40,909
Speaker 1: Well, you can learn for free from Harvard Harvard the best place learning on earth.

160
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,076
Speaker 1: There is a free online course.

161
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,428
Speaker 1: It's been there for years Digital photography.

162
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,860
Speaker 1: it is a 12 module course.

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,619
Speaker 1: It is a cost zero dollars to take this course and this will teach you everything in a structured non YouTube fashion.

164
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:07,010
Speaker 1: and While I know many of the things in this course like, you know The first like five modules like.

165
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,439
Speaker 1: there's a module on color that I don't know.

166
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:17,039
Speaker 1: I don't know any like I keep hearing things about color science, but I don't really know about color science, right?

167
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:22,400
Speaker 1: So even if you don't the whole thing is not useful to you because you know how to use a camera.

168
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:25,799
Speaker 1: There will be parts of this that are useful to you and free.

169
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:35,059
Speaker 1: So if you have a camera or even if you just want to take more pictures or whatever and you want to suck less You're not gonna get good because I'm still not good.

170
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:40,779
Speaker 1: But you know take this course and don't walk random YouTube videos because that takes way longer.

171
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:41,401
Speaker 1: Trust me I know.

172
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:43,130
Speaker 0: so speaking of random YouTube videos.

173
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,131
Speaker 0: This is just a short video of someone Cooking actual food like that.

178
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:07,499
Speaker 0: I think it's like a chemical burner in there.

179
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:17,269
Speaker 0: Okay And then on top of it use a little pan and like cooks the food in the tiny pan on the tiny Tweezer the little tiny cooking utensils.

Speaker 1: You don't have a tiny chicken.

186
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,553
Speaker 1: Tiny ingredients like a crumb is your loaf of bread.

187
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:30,960

233
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:43,000
Speaker 1: we started a new blank forum, which is now anything but blank.

234
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:43,923
Speaker 1: It's already.

235
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:45,048
Speaker 1: everyone's already moved over.

236
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:48,240
Speaker 0: there's already like this hundred post thread arguing about the ACLU.

237
00:15:48,742 --> 00:15:50,970
Speaker 1: Anyway, but the point is we got a brand new forum.

238
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,440
Speaker 1: It's everyone from the old ones brought on over.

239
00:15:53,581 --> 00:15:54,469
Speaker 1: It's fully active.

240
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:57,826

241
00:15:57,846 --> 00:16:00,555
Speaker 1: no more new posts there, but all of the content there.

242
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:04,788
Speaker 1: It will be there for all Time as long as the internet exists.

243
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:05,672
Speaker 1: and the web exists.

244
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:14,411
Speaker 0: Hopefully even longer than that I'll be able to save the data somewhere It will likely be able to outlive does Live us because we could make a trust that's pretty tiny.

245
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:15,636
Speaker 0: that could keep that going forever.

246
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:16,017
Speaker 1: Right?

247
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:19,053

Speaker 0: what you got to know is there are Sailor Scouts.

292
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:35,980
Speaker 0: They're the good guys.

293
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:41,650
Speaker 1: I know that yeah tuxedo mask The only thing that like the thing is in this movie.

294
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:51,265
Speaker 1: if you don't if you know not a lot about Sailor Scouts Like I don't like the only Sailor Scouts I know about our moon Mars Blue.

295
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:52,255
Speaker 0: what do you even know?

296
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:52,680
Speaker 0: mercury?

297
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:54,162
Speaker 0: Venus yet.

298
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:54,443
Speaker 0: Do you?

299
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:56,610
Speaker 1: well, I know that sailor V is.

300
00:18:56,731 --> 00:19:02,300
Speaker 1: obviously Venus doesn't join the show until pretty late I know but she hasn't joined the show in any part that I've watched.

301
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:06,696
Speaker 1: But sailor V is there from episode 1 right and they know that that sailor Venus.

302
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:07,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a minute.

303
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,007
Speaker 1: It's like duh, right.

304
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:11,640
Speaker 0: This is like no one will crack the code of who you really are.

305
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,781
Speaker 1: Yeah, the the mysterious superhero video game character It's

306
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:18,175
Speaker 0: cool when she shows up because Sailor Moon like didn't know anything like all the

307
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,922
Speaker 1: moon is stupid Yeah,

308
00:19:20,263 --> 00:19:29,308
Speaker 0: but all the Sailor Scouts like don't know what they're doing and then sailor V shows up and it's like yeah guys I've been doing this since uh forever ago and Yeah, let's talk.

309
00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:30,355
Speaker 0: you guys gotta learn some shit.

310
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:33,750
Speaker 1: Yeah But I think as I have I don't know about any of them.

311
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:35,659
Speaker 0: other say three other sailors come.

312
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:40,415
Speaker 1: well No, so sailor Jupiter is like I guess the green one and it thinks sailor Jupiter is.

313
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:42,000
Speaker 0: she comes like pretty early in the show.

314
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,367
Speaker 1: She's not in the show that I've seen.

315
00:19:43,427 --> 00:19:48,420
Speaker 1: but the point is is that you In this it's just a standalone movie, right?

316
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,443
Speaker 1: So you don't get any.

317
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:54,800
Speaker 1: any of the sailors other than moon don't really have any character action happening with them.

318
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,999
Speaker 1: They're not part of the story.

319
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:01,785
Speaker 1: They're just sort of there to do their special move and say hello just to be there though you do get this impression right away.

320
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:02,567
Speaker 0: so you don't know.

321
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:10,640
Speaker 1: you can already see that there's a bunch of regular Sailor Scouts as The other three are separate from them and they're older and they hang out not with them.

322
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,532
Speaker 1: Yeah, they act like adults is the middle school girls and then there's the adult one.

323
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:17,120
Speaker 0: So the adult ones are in high school.

324
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:25,240
Speaker 1: Okay, despite the fact that they're like The Sailor Moon and friends look like they're in high school and but they're actually middle school.

325
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,584
Speaker 1: So they're the other ones.

326
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,410
Speaker 1: look like adults, but they're in high school.

327
00:20:28,731 --> 00:20:31,220
Speaker 1: Yes, so it's either too young or too old?

328
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:31,638
Speaker 1: I don't know.

329
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:39,578
Speaker 0: So the funny thing about this movie the s movie is that this is where you see the other three Sailor Scouts like Uranus Neptune and Pluto.

330
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:46,060
Speaker 0: They're just so much better at being Sailor Scouts than everybody else.

331
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:48,660
Speaker 0: Their attacks are like a million times more powerful.

332
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,809
Speaker 0: They like have got their shit together.

333
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:57,180
Speaker 0: The Sailor Scouts like blah blah blah the cats in love or something I don't know and those three are like, well something's attacking the earth.

334
00:20:57,742 --> 00:21:02,140
Speaker 0: What should we do while we sit in this coffee shop being dramatic and adults?

335
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,873
Speaker 1: But the point is if you don't know these characters, you're not going to learn anything.

336
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:07,520
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get to know them, right?

337
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:11,286
Speaker 1: So, yeah, you definitely know.

338
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:15,000
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about friggin sailor tiny moon that she just fucked up.

339
00:21:15,362 --> 00:21:17,092
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, sure Chibi Uso, so she's.

340
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:18,420
Speaker 1: I know that there's like some deal.

341
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,051
Speaker 1: It's like she's sleeping with her mom and it's like no she's.

342
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:23,943
Speaker 0: she wants to bone her dad because she doesn't know that That's her dad.

343
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:25,048
Speaker 1: How did she not know?

344
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,560
Speaker 1: cuz she goes back in time, but she should know that.

345
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:28,485
Speaker 0: No, she goes back.

346
00:21:28,505 --> 00:21:32,450
Speaker 1: if I go back in time and see my mom when she's like in middle school I'll know it's my mom.

347
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:33,177
Speaker 0: What if you didn't?

348
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,366
Speaker 0: Cuz you're you know, you go back in time.

349
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:38,260
Speaker 1: The problem is the point is you're not gonna get this story from this movie.

350
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,239
Speaker 1: You're just gonna see this tiny Sailor Moon and be like what the fuck is up with her?

351
00:21:41,962 --> 00:21:44,291
Speaker 1: Right, and it's like like I was saying before.

352
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:50,114
Speaker 1: it's like I don't know anything about Sailor Jupiter But I get the feeling like maybe I should go back and watch until she appears.

353
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:51,360
Speaker 0: cuz she cuz she's green.

354
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:52,626
Speaker 1: So I think I might like her.

355
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,800
Speaker 0: you'll like her extra because when she becomes she's a green one.

356
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,892
Speaker 0: She doesn't use her powers because she's actually just super strong.

357
00:21:58,932 --> 00:22:01,060
Speaker 0: It just fucking punches people like she is.

358
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, she is dangerous on her own.

359
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:10,867
Speaker 1: The other thing if you watch this is like, you know, if you know anything about space There's no Sailor Earth and there's no Sailor.

360
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:11,810
Speaker 1: Sailor is tuxedo.

361
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:13,656
Speaker 0: Tuxedo mask is sailor.

362
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:14,800
Speaker 1: They don't tell you that in this movie.

363
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:17,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also you want to know where Sailor Saturn is.

364
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:24,340
Speaker 0: It's real complicated because the problem with this movie is that Sailor Moon s is the super serious Sailor Moon.

365
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:26,449
Speaker 0: They're like, it's the antenna like Sailor Moon.

366
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:26,951
Speaker 0: This is when you can.

367
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:28,920
Speaker 0: horror was like pushing his crazy nonsense.

368
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:43,210
Speaker 0: So it gets weird because it's hard to tell when this movie occurs Because the fact that you're just Neptune and Pluto are all alive and Sailor Moon has the Holy Grail.

369
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,607
Speaker 0: cuz she fucked her attack where she like, yeah She does Holy Grail attack.

370
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:48,571
Speaker 1: I was like damn son.

371
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:50,960
Speaker 0: That is the Holy Grail the whole plot.

372
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,114
Speaker 1: They're like, oh my god, you'll die if you use this special attack.

373
00:22:54,134 --> 00:23:00,976
Speaker 0: No, that's not the Holy Grail That's the silver crystal something that she also used sort of in the Sailor Moon our movie.

374
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,765
Speaker 0: Here's the plot of the Sailor Moon Our movie.

375
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,059
Speaker 0: Oh, no, we can't defeat the flower.

376
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,753
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon says I'll use the crystal whatever.

377
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:08,838
Speaker 0: no Sailor Moon.

378
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:10,405
Speaker 0: if you do that You'll die, but you didn't.

379
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:12,214
Speaker 0: but I have to and she does it.

380
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:16,571
Speaker 0: and then she dies And then she undies and the movie ends in this movie.

381
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:18,340
Speaker 1: She uses it and doesn't die doesn't die.

382
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:20,009
Speaker 1: So I guess it's okay to use it.

383
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:21,135
Speaker 1: It's not I guess.

384
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:22,040
Speaker 1: don't use it too often.

385
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:23,667
Speaker 0: I guess she powered it with her love.

386
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:26,660
Speaker 0: I mean remember slayers right like they're like don't use the Giga slave.

387
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:27,916
Speaker 0: It might destroy the universe.

388
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:33,100
Speaker 1: They did Well remember in real life when they said don't use that bomb you might incinerate the entire atmosphere.

389
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,666
Speaker 1: No But anyway I think it's just dangerous.

390
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:41,580
Speaker 0: cuz when the crystal heart like when that crystal heart is out The point is it's real vulnerable.

391
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,860
Speaker 1: If you don't know a lot about Sailor Moon, you're not going to get questions about fundamentals like who is sailing Saturn?

392
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,766
Speaker 1: Why is you know?

393
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:50,120
Speaker 1: and you're not gonna get that from here?

394
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,720
Speaker 1: What you're gonna get is you're gonna get a relatively standalone episode of Sailor Moon stretched into an hour.

395
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,925
Speaker 1: It could have been 20 minutes.

396
00:23:56,965 --> 00:24:02,306
Speaker 1: that is instead about an hour and is mostly about the cat and two NPCs that are gonna go After this movie's over.

397
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:07,544
Speaker 0: so my problems with these NPCs one that the professor guy Sucks at astronomy.

398
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:09,350
Speaker 0: Yeah sucks at life.

399
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:14,406
Speaker 1: like that guy is a really bad scientist who believes in nonsense Even though the nonsense is real.

400
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:15,551
Speaker 0: sort of he'd know.

401
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:17,700
Speaker 0: but the thing is the nonsense he believes in isn't even real.

402
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:21,980
Speaker 0: He believes that there's this magic princess on the moon and like yes tech there is true.

403
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:25,410
Speaker 0: But one the thing you think is the princess is not.

404
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:31,727
Speaker 0: and to the thing you think Sailor Moon is the princess on the moon In your childhood is nothing.

405
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:35,819
Speaker 0: you you just believe bullshit and there happen to be unrelated things.

406
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:43,216
Speaker 1: that Also, you're really lucky that that astronaut girlfriend likes you because damn she is like the awesomest.

407
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:44,780
Speaker 1: and how come she's not sailor something?

408
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, your first interaction.

409
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:46,706
Speaker 1: How come?

410
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:50,940
Speaker 1: yes, how come the smart scientist astronaut woman isn't sailor something?

411
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:56,040
Speaker 1: Cuz she's like she would just take care of everything and all these high school girls in middle school girls go back to school.

412
00:24:56,221 --> 00:25:06,925
Speaker 0: She's like, hey, I'm a character and he's like Why don't you believe my magic space moon nonsense that I believe my whole life because is bullshit and even better What is his reaction?

413
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:08,954
Speaker 0: He's looking in the sky, but he doesn't seem to.

414
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:10,380
Speaker 0: he's like, is that a comet right?

415
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,808
Speaker 0: And then he's like, oh shit it crashed into earth.

416
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:16,020
Speaker 0: and then he goes and finds a crystal that it that came out of it.

417
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:20,740
Speaker 0: And then he's like I saw a comet and she's like really I work at NASA.

418
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,245
Speaker 0: No one saw any comet.

419
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,092
Speaker 0: and he's like yeah hit the ground.

420
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:25,818
Speaker 0: and she's like comets don't hit the ground.

421
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,539
Speaker 1: if I come and hit The ground we'd be dead like everything you're saying makes no sense.

422
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:31,345
Speaker 1: You're an astronomer.

423
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,939
Speaker 1: You don't even see the comet in a meteor and a meteorite or any.

424
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,431
Speaker 0: What the fuck's wrong with you, dude?

425
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:37,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, why do I like you?

426
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,401
Speaker 1: I don't know.

427
00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:42,580
Speaker 1: It's anyway, the movies about the cat and the cat is usually an awesome character that I like a lot.

428
00:25:42,781 --> 00:25:44,027
Speaker 0: Yep, cut it head is awesome.

429
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:46,158
Speaker 1: But in this movie the cat is not so awesome.

430
00:25:46,198 --> 00:25:49,168
Speaker 0: So Full disclosure cat falls in love with the moron.

431
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:51,656
Speaker 0: we watched the dub.

432
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:52,840
Speaker 0: because why not?

433
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:54,688
Speaker 1: Because we should have watched the sub.

434
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,035
Speaker 0: That's why the sub is better.

435
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:57,140
Speaker 0: It was so bad.

436
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:59,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, the dub is extra bad bad dub.

437
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,033
Speaker 0: I forgot.

438
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:01,460
Speaker 0: I forgot how bad it is bad.

439
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,140
Speaker 0: What are the names of the characters?

440
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:16,491
Speaker 0: what you can do when they come for you and especially because the three outer sensei like They sound a lot more serious in the real Original Japanese and their voices are kind of bad.

441
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:19,460
Speaker 1: Okay, so here's my biggest problems with the dub number one.

442
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:21,286
Speaker 1: The cat has a stupid voice.

443
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:24,699
Speaker 0: She sounds like an old lady sounds like an old lady when really she's like a 20-something.

444
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:26,093
Speaker 1: That's really weird.

445
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:31,439
Speaker 1: Yeah Old lady cat to be in love with like this 20-something, dude.

446
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,753
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a moron and also Artemis all has a young man voice.

447
00:26:36,014 --> 00:26:38,020
Speaker 0: Why is Artemis so into this old lady cat?

448
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:47,049
Speaker 1: Well, another thing is I just sort of assumed from the beginning that those cats were together and then they tell you that they're not And it's like and then they are so basically Artemis.

449
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:48,634
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't the cats be together?

450
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,420
Speaker 0: That is yeah, why even racist?

451
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,650
Speaker 0: Why are you saying the cats got a date?

452
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:52,760
Speaker 1: cuz the cats got date?

453
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,305
Speaker 0: Why the cats got?

454
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:54,540
Speaker 0: you're like Cartman in that episode?

455
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,080
Speaker 1: Listen cats if it was a cat person and a human that'd be okay, but not a cat and a person's bestiality.

456
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:03,949
Speaker 0: But she'd well, she has a cat person technically.

457
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,835
Speaker 1: Why doesn't she just talk to the dude also?

458
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:07,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, she almost does.

459
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:13,460
Speaker 1: It's okay for these random NPCs to see Sailor Moon With a holy grail, but it's not okay for them to see a talking cat.

460
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:15,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that point just be like, okay.

461
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:17,720
Speaker 1: Listen, listen, like you've seen Sailor Moon, right?

462
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,688
Speaker 1: So talking cat should not be a problem for you.

463
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, this guy's just so dumb.

464
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,339
Speaker 1: I mean you already believe in Space Moon Princess.

465
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:27,200
Speaker 1: So talking cat should be just fine for you.

466
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:32,294
Speaker 0: But this can also be confusing because the dumb professor looks just like Sailor Uranus.

467
00:27:32,876 --> 00:27:33,337
Speaker 1: Oh, does he?

468
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:34,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, like save hair.

469
00:27:34,748 --> 00:27:41,250
Speaker 0: Basically Hair hair same face.

470
00:27:41,692 --> 00:27:43,740
Speaker 0: The eyes are just bigger here same hair.

471
00:27:44,382 --> 00:27:51,360
Speaker 0: Maybe also the professor looks just like Professor Tomoe from Sailor Moon s.

472
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:53,006
Speaker 1: Isn't this Sailor Moon s?

473
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:57,792
Speaker 0: Yes, but this is the movie which has nothing to do with the series except I guess it takes place around.

474
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:05,740
Speaker 1: like Is a name of a character and I know that name and I know it's a Sailor Moon character Sailor Saturn's ma dad.

475
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:10,874
Speaker 1: I've never seen Professor Tomoe and I don't know what he does or how he comes into the picture or anything.

476
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:14,345
Speaker 0: He is insane and Dangerous is a bad guy.

477
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:14,827
Speaker 0: Yes.

478
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,277
Speaker 0: Okay, but it's complicated.

479
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:21,169
Speaker 0: basically Your question in the beginning of where's the Sailor Saturn?

480
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,300
Speaker 0: That's kind of the whole plot of Sailor Moon s is where is Sailor Saturn?

481
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,577
Speaker 0: Alright cuz Sailor Saturn's power is we fucked up reset the entire universe and kill fucking everybody.

482
00:28:30,697 --> 00:28:31,639
Speaker 1: So why is it?

483
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,415
Speaker 1: Sailor Saturn that has this power and not like, you know Jupiter, which is way bigger.

484
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,683
Speaker 0: Well because it's not about bigger It's about mythology.

485
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:43,520
Speaker 0: or Mercury which is way closer has the power of stop time and time travel.

486
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:47,750
Speaker 1: Or why not Sailor Andromeda who has the power of entire galaxy?

487
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:49,897
Speaker 0: Well, there's other sailors to read the manga.

488
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:55,757
Speaker 0: but So Artemis who's derpy is in love with Luna forget the dub.

489
00:28:55,797 --> 00:28:56,740
Speaker 0: she doesn't seem derpy.

490
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,449
Speaker 1: He seems like totally chill and smart.

491
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,896
Speaker 0: So he is per surprise.

492
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:00,600
Speaker 1: He doesn't do more.

493
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,966
Speaker 1: He just sort of does nothing in this movie.

494
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:03,030
Speaker 0: that is so he is.

495
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:08,452
Speaker 0: he is basically he is the Luna to sailor V Mmm, so like how come the other sailors don't have?

496
00:29:08,472 --> 00:29:09,275
Speaker 0: because fuck them.

497
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:10,660
Speaker 1: I don't know not cat worthy.

498
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:12,097
Speaker 0: I don't know why they're those two.

499
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,191
Speaker 0: The manga probably has some reason for it.

500
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:19,044
Speaker 0: Shouldn't there be a cat per sailor spoilers in Stars?

501
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:25,260
Speaker 0: when people come back from the future There's a Diana who's a tiny pink cat and Diana is the child of Artemis and Luna.

502
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:28,860
Speaker 1: So Artemis Luna find out so it's minikat sailor minikat.

503
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they find out that they're gonna bone and make a baby at least one baby before they started dating.

504
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:36,005
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, so they're not dating yet.

505
00:29:36,547 --> 00:29:37,851
Speaker 0: Not really even a thing.

506
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:40,934
Speaker 0: and then their future child comes down and says hey mom and dad Okay.

507
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:48,850
Speaker 1: So if I'm sitting with someone I've never met before Like someone I'm only friends and kid from the future comes And it's totally and they prove it.

508
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:51,358
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't we start boning like right away?

509
00:29:51,378 --> 00:29:52,100
Speaker 1: It's like we're gonna bone.

510
00:29:52,120 --> 00:30:06,900
Speaker 0: Anyway, so at the very end of Sailor Moon, right the very very end of stars Artemis Basically, the last thing he says in the entire show is like dumb throwaway line and a dumb throwaway scene.

511
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,903
Speaker 0: You just never see him again.

512
00:30:07,984 --> 00:30:08,525
Speaker 0: cuz fuck him.

513
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:12,278
Speaker 0: No, there's a theme throughout the entire show of yeah, we just gotta forget.

514
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:14,847
Speaker 0: he exists Occasionally we remember.

515
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,254
Speaker 1: Oh, but he seems good though.

516
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:17,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, he really totally wasted.

517
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:21,560
Speaker 0: He's the nice guy who really wants to date Luna, but Luna's like cats don't fall in love.

518
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:24,520
Speaker 1: Wow, except in this movie, which is about cats falling in love.

519
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,280
Speaker 0: Well Luna's weird cuz she's like cats don't fall in love and they're just not a thing for us.

520
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:34,199
Speaker 0: And then she falls in love with this human like immediately the cat behind my apartment would beg to differ.

521
00:30:38,723 --> 00:30:45,594
Speaker 1: The other thing that sucks about this dub besides we we went a long time talking about old lady cat voice *weird noises*.

522
00:30:46,502 --> 00:30:51,940
Speaker 1: Right, so that the bad guy is the generic space ice queen who's somehow really powerful.

523
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,660
Speaker 0: So her characterization is I have existed since the beginning of time.

524
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,880
Speaker 1: I'm an evil ice space queen and then later Artemis.

525
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:04,283
Speaker 0: I've decided to attack earth because because I want to add it to my collection All right.

526
00:31:04,343 --> 00:31:06,774
Speaker 0: I tried to attack earth once and was foiled somehow.

527
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:07,738
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try.

528
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:12,600
Speaker 0: I'm basically Galactus only an ice queen but she is as old as time.

529
00:31:13,468 --> 00:31:21,413
Speaker 0: Sure She is she is like a super mega boss as we know because when she comes in the movie She beats all the Sailor Scouts.

530
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:22,700
Speaker 0: even the Holy Grail can't stop her.

531
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:30,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's way strong But she doesn't really have any character other than I'm the bad guy and I want to collect the earth and I was foiled in The past.

532
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:38,020
Speaker 1: and most of her attacks she attacks by sending out these ice minion Women banshee things and they make in the dub.

533
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:39,928
Speaker 1: I don't know what noises they make in the sub.

534
00:31:39,968 --> 00:31:42,237
Speaker 0: they make us say the same noise in the sub.

535
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:43,990
Speaker 1: in the dub They make a noise.

536
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:55,760
Speaker 1: That's basically basically high-pitched Zoidberg and You spend about 25% of the movie listening to that whooping noise and watching character transformations and special attacks.

537
00:31:56,121 --> 00:32:10,588
Speaker 0: All of the Sailor Moon movies are primarily excuses to show the highest quality Transformation and at least one move usually two of every character and because you get a bunch of the characters in this one just transformation It would be a 20-minute episode.

538
00:32:10,668 --> 00:32:21,060
Speaker 1: But the reason it's an hour long is because whooping noises Transformations special attacks and then like maybe 10 minutes of exposition with cats falling in love.

539
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:23,374
Speaker 1: So other than that, it's an episode of Sailor Moon.

540
00:32:23,394 --> 00:32:24,159
Speaker 1: Not really a movie.

541
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:36,740
Speaker 0: well The other the only interesting thing is that the villain of the episode because remember this takes place in the middle of Sailor Moon Which is like the holy grail end of the world like Pharaohs coming to take over earth.

542
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,161
Speaker 1: Is that?

543
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:37,422
Speaker 1: is that?

544
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:38,766
Speaker 1: wait but this is Sailor Moon s.

545
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:43,060
Speaker 0: after that comes Sailor Moon super s candy candy monsters and the circus.

546
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,430
Speaker 1: But I mean, that's the end of Sailor Moon.

547
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,253
Speaker 1: is the super answer.

548
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:46,474
Speaker 0: Nope.

549
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:47,137
Speaker 0: The end is stars.

550
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:50,770
Speaker 1: Okay stars is where there's a so it's Sailor Moon.

551
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,813
Speaker 1: then what RS?

552
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:53,137
Speaker 1: super s star.

553
00:32:53,157 --> 00:32:53,920
Speaker 0: Yes star.

554
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,411
Speaker 0: So super s is the dead the dead moon.

555
00:32:57,451 --> 00:32:58,815
Speaker 0: and all this like dream shit happens.

556
00:32:59,176 --> 00:32:59,939
Speaker 0: stars is yeah.

557
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,189
Speaker 0: Well while the entirety of Sailor Moon up to this point was happening.

558
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:06,700
Speaker 0: That's all constrained to this one solar system, right?

559
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:14,735
Speaker 0: There's a galactic war that's been going on that whole time And meanwhile the entire rest of the universe is fucked by this war.

560
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:21,517
Speaker 0: and now the war Comes to earth because this is like the last solar system that hasn't been dragged into the war.

561
00:33:21,537 --> 00:33:22,159
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

562
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:30,945
Speaker 0: So it's like all the sailors of all the other solar systems like all this nonsense isn't happening and it's like if World War 2 was happening For decades

563
00:33:31,126 --> 00:33:32,171
Speaker 1: and you were in Switzerland and

564
00:33:32,191 --> 00:33:38,920
Speaker 0: you were in the US and the US just didn't know Like literally like the US had the Civil War just going and going and going and the Civil War ends.

565
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,007
Speaker 0: You're like, ah, thank God that war is over.

566
00:33:41,027 --> 00:33:44,480
Speaker 0: and then like this boat goes by New York and you're like, what's that boat?

567
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:47,011
Speaker 0: That's what stars is.

568
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:47,617
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

569
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:54,659
Speaker 0: so the the baddies of s are like super dangerous and that's what they're actually fighting.

570
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:01,999
Speaker 0: and in the middle of all that This shit happens, which is just as dangerous and is resolved in the course of like one day

571
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:02,924
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

572
00:34:03,527 --> 00:34:14,849
Speaker 0: so it's just interesting to see that in perspective you can figure out Based on who's alive and whether or not the fact that Sailor Moon has the Holy Grail Exactly where in s this occurs.

573
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:16,755
Speaker 1: I'm sure you just look it up too on Wikipedia.

574
00:34:16,775 --> 00:34:20,781
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah I found someone said it's episode 122 or 123.

575
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:35,172
Speaker 1: So you could really just take all the episodes after that increase their number by one and stick this right in there as episode Whatever which is horrifying because then it's like this long crazy drama building toward this like mega enemy Mistress 9 and Pharaoh and all that nonsense.

576
00:34:35,454 --> 00:34:36,739
Speaker 1: Pharaoh like the Egyptian Pharaoh.

577
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,190
Speaker 0: Yeah Pharaoh's coming home like Pharaoh.

578
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,347
Speaker 1: let my people go Pharaoh is basically the Moses.

579
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:48,449
Speaker 0: remember that the bad guy in the fifth element Yeah, Pharaoh's basically that but that's a shitty villain.

580
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:50,436
Speaker 0: No the thing from space not the dude.

581
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:56,909
Speaker 0: Oh Professor Tomoe is the dude And Pharaoh is the thing.

582
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,917
Speaker 1: Oh is is uh, serious.

583
00:34:58,937 --> 00:34:59,922
Speaker 0: It's got if you don't watch Are you?

587
00:35:23,129 --> 00:35:25,140

589
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:29,680
Speaker 0: that was so good.

590
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,308
Speaker 0: That was tight the a-plus.

591
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,520
Speaker 1: that I mean, I've seen other Ruby rods in the past.

592
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:36,469
Speaker 1: That is not only the best Ruby rod cosplay.

593
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:37,211
Speaker 1: I've seen in my life.

594
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:42,322
Speaker 1: There's the best as cosplay of 2016 Period.

595
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:46,057

596
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,569
Speaker 1: I mean It was so great.

597
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:49,498
Speaker 0: I don't even know what to say.

598
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:56,884
Speaker 0: So Anyway back from that Ruby rod cosplay if you're gonna watch any Sailor Moon like Sailor Moon I'm gonna Google.

599
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:57,186
Speaker 1: It's even.

600
00:35:57,227 --> 00:35:57,751
Speaker 1: it took a photo.

601
00:35:57,932 --> 00:36:05,290
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon s is like Everything you would like about Sailor Moon But anyway, this movie takes place in the middle of it.

602
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:14,960
Speaker 0: So in the middle of that gigantic horrible plot, that's serious one of the villains of the day happens to be a villain for the beginning of beginning of time.

603
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,165
Speaker 0: similarly galactic threat And they just deal with it and move on.

604
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:28,593
Speaker 0: and it's just kind of weird to see that transition there like oh the holy grail That's the whole plot of Sailor Moon s. Yeah, it doesn't even fucking work.

605
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:30,500
Speaker 0: That's how powerful the Snow Queen is.

606
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:35,191
Speaker 0: Uh, I mean the plot gets resolved kind of stupidly.

607
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:37,199
Speaker 0: it's just like oh the power of love or whatever.

608
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:39,776
Speaker 0: yeah, you can watch the movie if you really care.

609
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:42,397
Speaker 0: and What else happens?

610
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:45,395
Speaker 0: This movie is just like you can watch it.

611
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,259
Speaker 0: I guess I Used to think of it as the best of the Sailor Moon movies.

612
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:52,692
Speaker 0: Think it still might be the best of the Sailor Moon movies.

613
00:36:52,953 --> 00:36:54,400
Speaker 1: It's better than a candy one.

614
00:36:54,681 --> 00:37:00,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know how you'll take the our movie the gay space flower that comes to destroy the earth.

00:37:01,242 --> 00:37:03,519
Speaker 0: It's a lot like that one piece movie that we watched.
