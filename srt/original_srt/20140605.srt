1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,730
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, June 4th, 2014.

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,557
Speaker 0: I'm Rem, and this is Geek Nights.

3
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:18,425
Speaker 0: Tonight, Ghost in the Shell Arise.

4
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:21,115
Speaker 0: Or at least the first two episodes.

5
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:22,299
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,742 --> 00:00:31,600
Speaker 0: So we got to see Takashi Murakami's jellyfish eyes.

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,948
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically it was really weird.

8
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:37,308
Speaker 1: So if you don't know, there's two Murakamis and people get them confused.

9
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:37,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's the 1Q84.

10
00:00:39,262 --> 00:00:40,890
Speaker 1: The author Haruki Murakami.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,980
Speaker 0: But no, we're talking about super flat Murakami.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,200
Speaker 1: Right, the guy we went to see his art exhibit in Brooklyn some years ago.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,186
Speaker 0: Yep, that was when we learned that most of the people in the world that we know were slow walkers.

14
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:59,068
Speaker 1: Anyway, so he was coming to the city because he made a movie, and I was like, "Well, I don't care what that movie is, he made it and he's going to be there, so I want to go to

15
00:00:59,109 --> 00:00:59,310
Speaker 1: that.".

16
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:03,673
Speaker 1: I tried to buy tickets and their website basically didn't work because I said, "Oh well, I guess I didn't get

17
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:04,075
Speaker 1: tickets.".

18
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,327
Speaker 1: And then I checked my credit card statement at the end of the month and they charged me money, and I was like, "Hey, what the

19
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:09,629
Speaker 1: hell?".

20
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,911
Speaker 1: So I called the box office and was like, "You charged me money for a thing I didn't get tickets

21
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:14,072
Speaker 1: to.".

22
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:14,796
Speaker 1: They said, "You did get

23
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:15,198
Speaker 1: tickets.".

24
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:17,609
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Oh shit, this thing is in like two days.

25
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:18,954
Speaker 1: I'm glad I checked with

26
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:19,135
Speaker 1: you.".

27
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:21,126
Speaker 1: So we went to see it.

28
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:22,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was crazy sold out.

29
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:27,959
Speaker 0: There were like a hundred people hanging around hoping to get in on standby, and he was there.

30
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,379
Speaker 0: Like we walk in, Scott and our friends Phil and James do.

31
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:36,949
Speaker 1: I mostly wanted to go because I knew the movie Good or Bad was going to look crazy because he made it.

32
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:37,619
Speaker 0: And it did.

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,140
Speaker 1: And I knew that I wanted to see what this guy was like because his art is crazy.

34
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:47,847
Speaker 0: So we're not going to do too much of an in-depth review just because a movie like this, just go see it.

35
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:48,959
Speaker 1: Well, how are you going to see it?

36
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,240
Speaker 0: I'm sure there will be a way to see it at some point.

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,635
Speaker 1: It's going to be a while before you have a chance to see it.

38
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:55,404
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't think it's on the internet yet.

39
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:57,593
Speaker 0: But it is beautiful.

40
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:58,718
Speaker 0: I will say that.

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,271
Speaker 0: It is absolutely beautiful the way it's filmed.

42
00:02:01,552 --> 00:02:04,806
Speaker 0: The compositing is really good except for some of the weird fights at the end.

43
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:11,820
Speaker 0: The characters are actually really cute and weird except the one guy who just looks like a dude in a costume.

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,185
Speaker 1: You don't like Luxor?

45
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:19,129
Speaker 0: Well, Luxor's size is proportionate to the sadness and the heart of that little girl.

46
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:19,631
Speaker 0: Sure.

47
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:23,027
Speaker 1: I think Luxor might actually be the best one in my book.

48
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:24,455
Speaker 0: I don't know.

49
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,714
Speaker 0: The jellyfish dude was pretty cool because he was the most badass.

50
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:28,660
Speaker 0: What about Coco?

51
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:30,164
Speaker 1: The monkey?

52
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,007
Speaker 1: No.

53
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:33,679
Speaker 0: Coco was the fighting game girl.

54
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:37,360
Speaker 0: Oh, well that's- Co to the second power, Coco.

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,425
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.

56
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:42,753
Speaker 0: I guess that kid was sadder than the girl who had Luxor because he had like a million Pokemon.

57
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,000
Speaker 0: He was the hikikomori.

58
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,711
Speaker 0: Yeah.

59
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:44,958
Speaker 1: Yeah.

60
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:46,222
Speaker 0: I don't know.

61
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:49,955
Speaker 0: This movie, it started out like it was going to be ET.

62
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:55,820
Speaker 0: You know, kid finds a weird thing, hiding it from his parents, but then it immediately turns into Pokemon.

63
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,846
Speaker 1: And then it turns into Godzilla.

64
00:02:58,127 --> 00:02:58,950
Speaker 0: Yup, pretty much.

65
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:06,922
Speaker 0: And the good things I can say about it, it was beautiful and weird and I actually was surprised by it at a number of points.

66
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:11,657
Speaker 0: The bad things I can say about it, the child actors were kind of bad.

67
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:15,251
Speaker 0: The story was pretty dumb in the end.

68
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:17,843
Speaker 1: It was like a typical live action Japanese kids movie.

69
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:18,165
Speaker 0: Yup.

70
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:21,200
Speaker 0: It reminded me a lot of actually Juvenile.

71
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty similar.

72
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:27,589
Speaker 1: Except without the, this also had the Godzilla listening to this knows what the fuck Juvenile.

73
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,956
Speaker 0: Oh my God, Juvenile.

74
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:30,108
Speaker 0: We should do a show on that.

75
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:30,580
Speaker 0: Yeah.

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,586
Speaker 0: I'd have to watch it again.

77
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:33,340
Speaker 0: How'd we even fucking get that?

78
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:34,713
Speaker 1: It was on some random tape.

79
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:35,259
Speaker 0: Yup.

80
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,747
Speaker 1: In the anime club or some shit.

81
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,841
Speaker 0: We just saw this VHS tape and it was labeled Juvenile.

82
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:41,326
Speaker 0: We're like, what the fuck is that?

83
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,980
Speaker 0: It's actually just Japanese ET.

84
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:47,936
Speaker 1: Sure.

85
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:48,280
Speaker 0: Basically.

86
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:48,840
Speaker 0: Yup.

87
00:03:49,867 --> 00:04:06,441
Speaker 0: But yeah, this thing was just, it has kind of this ham fisted Fukushima sort of metaphor allegory about you have to have optimism and there's sadness and coming of age and there's a lot of ideas sort of just mishmash together into it.

88
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:17,856
Speaker 0: So I can't say that it was good, but it was definitely enjoyable, but you got to enjoy some parts of it from the perspective of why is that cultist so angry?

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,862
Speaker 0: He got what he wanted.

90
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:21,348
Speaker 0: None of the other cultists are angry.

91
00:04:21,368 --> 00:04:24,982
Speaker 1: Uh, I guess in other news, there's other news.

92
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:25,706
Speaker 0: Not really.

93
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:26,168
Speaker 1: There is.

94
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:33,169
Speaker 1: There's hardly any news, but I just wanted to remind people number one, saga volume three should be out now, right?

95
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:44,359
Speaker 1: And two, uh, at this as of like some days ago, maybe even a week ago, the last episode of Gundam UC unicorn is out.

96
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,888
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

97
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,054
Speaker 0: So this is pretty chill.

98
00:04:55,094 --> 00:05:05,556
Speaker 0: This is basically one of those things where it's two cultures that aren't United States slash English speaking Western world and commentary on each other, which is the kind of thing I always like.

99
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:19,224
Speaker 0: So it's the guy who's Malaysian, speaks Malaysian, speaks Japanese, and he's explaining mostly for the benefit of other people who aren't necessarily us about Japanese phrases and Japanese sayings.

100
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,812
Speaker 0: and Japanese people do like this.

101
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:23,765
Speaker 0: That's, this is, it's very different from how Malaysian people do.

102
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:32,574
Speaker 0: And the best of his videos, I'll link to both of them cause they're pretty great is how does, how to use high like a Japanese.

103
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:33,456
Speaker 0: Okay.

104
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:35,722
Speaker 0: And the four levels of the Japanese.

105
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:40,675
Speaker 0: Hey, Hey, Hey, it's really good.

106
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:41,657
Speaker 0: It's really good.

107
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:43,784
Speaker 0: Especially if you don't speak Japanese.

108
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:46,274
Speaker 0: that well, but you watch a lot of anime.

109
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,248
Speaker 0: If you watch these videos, you'll be like, ah, I get it.

110
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,555
Speaker 1: I think you sort of naturally get it.

111
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:55,966
Speaker 1: I feel like I already know the four levels of A.

112
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:56,989
Speaker 0: You'd think so.

113
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,363
Speaker 0: The more, uh, important or dangerous ones are actually shorter.

114
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:03,508
Speaker 0: All right.

115
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,934
Speaker 0: Hey has a profound theory.

116
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:09,182
Speaker 1: So you remember retro game master.

117
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:11,432
Speaker 0: Do I ever game center CX?

118
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:14,484
Speaker 1: Did you know that it was a retro game challenge too for the Nintendo DS?

119
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:15,447
Speaker 0: What?

120
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:16,371
Speaker 0: Why don't I own that?

121
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:20,126
Speaker 1: Because it never was and probably never will be released in English.

122
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:20,688
Speaker 0: Fuck.

123
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,632
Speaker 0: I'll just play it in Japanese.

124
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:21,994
Speaker 0: Whatever.

125
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:30,419
Speaker 1: Well, you might be excited to know some fans just came out a few days ago with a translation patch.

126
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:30,779
Speaker 0: Wow.

127
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:35,412
Speaker 1: Get your DS emulators or DS piracy cards all fixed up.

128
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:38,602
Speaker 1: Patch that ROM and play the game center.

129
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:39,907
Speaker 0: That takes me back.

130
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:47,131
Speaker 0: It takes me back to a day when I discovered final fantasy five and I had a ROM of it, but it was in Japanese.

131
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:53,571
Speaker 0: Then I found a patch that made that ROM in English and oh fuck did I play that game.

132
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:58,788
Speaker 0: and also fuck did the translation not just sort of Peter out about two thirds of the way through.

133
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:04,851
Speaker 0: It just that all the words got replaced with like sword icons and gibberish.

134
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:05,353
Speaker 1: Yep.

135
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:07,000
Speaker 0: So as a result, I never beat that game.

136
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,444
Speaker 0: Also fuck the shield dragon.

137
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:10,791
Speaker 1: Meta moments.

138
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,720
Speaker 0: Book Club book is identical for Lebowitz.

139
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,906
Speaker 1: I read like a chapter and then stop.

140
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:20,060
Speaker 0: precursor book, the proto culture book to all the like.

141
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,417
Speaker 0: post apocalypse survival in a place with a color system books we've read.

142
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:28,834
Speaker 1: If anyone knows an earlier store instance of that story, please tell it to us.

143
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:35,539
Speaker 0: Wikipedia lists a few, but I think this one is the beginning of the modern era of post apocalypse survival.

144
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,337
Speaker 1: Well, something I realized is even the idea of a manmade apocalypse, right?

145
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:41,461
Speaker 1: I mean, it's Noah's arc, right?

146
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:43,429
Speaker 1: But the idea wasn't made by man.

147
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,823
Speaker 1: No, as I'm saying is that apocalypse is in general Noah's arc, right?

148
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,152
Speaker 1: Or maybe even older than that, but right.

149
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:49,674
Speaker 1: Right.

150
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:52,805
Speaker 1: The idea of a manmade apocalypse, right?

151
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:59,913
Speaker 1: Didn't even, it wasn't even conceivable to people because we didn't have any things that could possibly do that.

152
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:00,958
Speaker 0: Well, imagine you're Roman.

153
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:03,348
Speaker 0: You're like, all right, what do we do?

154
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:06,140
Speaker 0: Just start stabbing the earth and keep stabbing it until it dies.

155
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,581
Speaker 1: Right?

156
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:10,217
Speaker 1: It's like other than something that comes from God or nature or whatever, right?

157
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,906
Speaker 1: I got a God or nature, whatever.

158
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:19,110
Speaker 1: the only, we couldn't even conceive of a manmade apocalypse until we invented nuclear weapons, right?

159
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:26,377
Speaker 1: So this kind of story didn't really exist until we invented nuclear weapons, which was less than a century ago.

160
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:31,297
Speaker 0: And funnily enough, most of the post-apocalypses in these stores are caused by nuclear weapons.

161
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:36,514
Speaker 0: You don't say occasionally get the biological weapon, the zombie, right?

162
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:42,221
Speaker 1: Well, the only, the only stories that are otherwise are stuff like cat's cradle where someone makes up something fictional, right?

163
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:42,904
Speaker 1: Like ice nine.

164
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:44,187
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

165
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:44,589
Speaker 0: Yep.

166
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:47,939
Speaker 0: In other news, you should join us at Connecticut.

167
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,851
Speaker 0: Second week of June and the weekend, I think it's the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th.

168
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:55,628
Speaker 0: Uh, Connecticut con is not better than packs prime.

169
00:08:55,969 --> 00:09:00,845
Speaker 0: No, it's not better than magfest unless you're into anything other than gaming.

170
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:01,307
Speaker 1: Yeah.

171
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,785
Speaker 0: And it's a better gaming con than almost every gaming con in the United States.

172
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:07,391
Speaker 0: All rolled into one.

173
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:11,768
Speaker 0: So as we've said before, you know, we, we run the panels and workshops department.

174
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,812
Speaker 0: So we scheduled a, I think a pretty bad ass schedule of panels and lectures and workshops and stuff.

175
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:17,375
Speaker 1: You know what?

176
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:21,070
Speaker 1: It might be the best panels and lectures period at any con.

177
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:31,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might be actually, I think, I think we pretty much, you know, our department, you know, not to be all self aggrandizing, but I think about the panels and lectures departments of other cons and their schedules.

178
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:36,357
Speaker 1: and it's like the big cons, mostly of industry panels, which are boring as hell.

179
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,335
Speaker 1: And the small cons just, you know, either they have rain bro dash, right?

180
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:46,576
Speaker 1: And then the other cons like anime Boston, like it's really good, but it's anime only Connecticut con.

181
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:50,149
Speaker 1: We got panels on everything of the highest quality.

182
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,824
Speaker 0: Absolutely everything except we don't have anything on the demo scenes.

183
00:09:54,904 --> 00:10:00,664
Speaker 1: So email us, uh, other meta things you should go and find us on the internet.

184
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:10,380
Speaker 1: I mean, if you're listening to this, you probably already have, but we have many places on the internet, Twitter, IRC, newsletter, forum, Facebook's got pluses.

185
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:11,144
Speaker 1: We have everything.

186
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:15,646
Speaker 0: I feel like we should put that part at the end and the closer as opposed to in the meta moment.

187
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:18,077
Speaker 1: No people probably turn off the podcast by then.

188
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:20,107
Speaker 0: So somebody listens for the first time though.

189
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:21,997
Speaker 0: might listen to that cause it's explained some stuff.

190
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,043
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't know.

191
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:23,988
Speaker 0: I don't know guys.

192
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:24,832
Speaker 0: I'll say this.

193
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,199
Speaker 0: I'm going to highlight one thing.

194
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:36,865
Speaker 0: If you're going to interact with us in any way, the best way to do that right now is to share our shit on Reddit because Reddit won't let you put your own stuff up and people are really weird about that on Reddit.

195
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,591
Speaker 0: So it's up to you.

196
00:10:39,193 --> 00:10:42,686
Speaker 0: The more popular you make our videos, the more videos we'll do.

197
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:43,048
Speaker 1: Right.

198
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:43,449
Speaker 1: Go.

199
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,285
Speaker 1: We need a people who like us to go and promote us because at least on Reddit.

200
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:47,727
Speaker 0: Yeah.

201
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,274
Speaker 1: It's hard to do otherwise.

202
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:51,805
Speaker 1: Maybe we should use our project wonderful money to buy some ads.

203
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:52,468
Speaker 1: I don't know.

204
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:56,724
Speaker 0: We just need someone to pay someone else to post our stuff on Reddit.

205
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:57,165
Speaker 1: Sure.

206
00:10:57,868 --> 00:10:59,674
Speaker 1: Make a new account, fake account, whatever.

207
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:00,357
Speaker 1: Yeah.

208
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:01,661
Speaker 0: Gig nights.

209
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:03,446
Speaker 0: Fuck.

210
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:04,208
Speaker 0: I already fucked it up.

211
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:04,569
Speaker 0: Yeah.

212
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:05,291
Speaker 1: Whatever.

213
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:12,772
Speaker 0: So pretty much since standalone complex second gig and then the, uh, pretty okay.

214
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:14,657
Speaker 0: Solid state society OAV came out.

215
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:16,884
Speaker 0: Uh, I've modicum magic.

216
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:17,406
Speaker 0: It was great.

217
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:24,716
Speaker 0: I really enjoyed Kill La Kill, but all I really want out of anime is more ghost in the shell standalone complex.

218
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:28,030
Speaker 1: Well, they're not going to get more of that, but you will get more ghosts in the shell.

219
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:28,934
Speaker 1: In fact, we just did.

220
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:29,818
Speaker 0: Yep.

221
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:35,097
Speaker 0: And it's the closest thing to standalone complex that has come out since standalone complex.

222
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,788
Speaker 1: It's the only ghost in the shell that's come out.

223
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:42,707
Speaker 0: Yes, but there have been no other anime that scratched that itch at all.

224
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,998
Speaker 0: This is the only anime that scratches that.

225
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:50,974
Speaker 1: Some people would make some animes or mangas in a ghost in the shell ish cyberpunk genre.

226
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:51,235
Speaker 0: Yeah.

227
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,526
Speaker 0: It's not a dystopia ghost in the show.

228
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:55,750
Speaker 0: It's not a utopia.

229
00:11:56,091 --> 00:12:01,468
Speaker 0: It's just kind of a realistic future of cyber tech and cyberspace and all that stuff.

230
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,080
Speaker 0: But at the same time, procedural police drama.

231
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:05,580
Speaker 1: Yep.

232
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:09,434
Speaker 0: So not going to spoil a million things.

233
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:12,907
Speaker 0: Let's spoil a few things because we didn't see all of a rise.

234
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:14,071
Speaker 1: It's not all out yet.

235
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:15,396
Speaker 1: Much like Gundam unicorn.

236
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:19,614
Speaker 1: I was originally going to wait until all of it was out and then watch it all at once.

237
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:20,277
Speaker 1: But you know what?

238
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,844
Speaker 1: They went and put episodes one and two, uh, in a theater in New York city and I'm like, well, might as well go see it.

239
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:28,331
Speaker 1: And I went to see it.

240
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:29,195
Speaker 0: And you know what?

241
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:32,810
Speaker 0: I'm glad we watched it on the big screen because it was really loud.

242
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,436
Speaker 0: It wasn't that loud.

243
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:44,703
Speaker 0: I've been in louder theaters where the plot of a ghost in the shell standalone complex season would encompass, you know, a certain thing.

244
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:45,828
Speaker 0: Like there's a politician.

245
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:46,892
Speaker 0: We finally bring him down.

246
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:56,305
Speaker 1: Every episode of this has about the same amount of plots, but there's also this sort of a overarching plot to the whole thing, right?

247
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:56,767
Speaker 1: Yeah.

248
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:58,734
Speaker 1: Formation of section nine and whatnot.

249
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:04,520
Speaker 0: Well, of course we know pretty much the gist of it, at least from all the other ghosts in the shell media.

250
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:04,861
Speaker 1: Right.

251
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:09,222
Speaker 1: But you're getting all these details that may or may not conflict with previous camera.

252
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:15,260
Speaker 0: It already conflicts a couple of times in tone with a standalone complexes backstories.

253
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:15,781
Speaker 1: Yeah.

254
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:16,967
Speaker 1: And some of the characters are different.

255
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:21,346
Speaker 1: Like Saito is pretty excitable, but complex is super serious.

256
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:24,098
Speaker 0: Excitable is probably the best way to describe it, right?

257
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:27,335
Speaker 1: But he's super serious in standalone complex and other ghosts in the shells.

258
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:28,943
Speaker 1: It's like, why did they change his personality?

259
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:31,796
Speaker 1: Or maybe he's just going to show us his personality changing.

260
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:38,243
Speaker 1: But no, because there was a flashback in standalone complex that showed him in the past being super serious.

261
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,308
Speaker 1: So it doesn't make sense.

262
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:39,830
Speaker 1: Right.

263
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:40,915
Speaker 1: That's just one example.

264
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:43,425
Speaker 1: But other things are perfectly match of the canon.

265
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:46,779
Speaker 1: Like Toga is a detective and he's getting noticed.

266
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,100
Speaker 1: Right.

267
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:49,832
Speaker 1: And probably, you know, that's probably going to match up really well.

268
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:53,829
Speaker 1: And, you know, bottles is a ranger and he seems pretty similar to.

269
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,291
Speaker 0: Yep.

270
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:58,427
Speaker 0: But everyone's definitely their younger self like they have more energy.

271
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:05,331
Speaker 0: They're they're surprisingly all kind of snarky with each other and they all mostly know who each other are.

272
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:10,107
Speaker 0: Like they're all kind of famous or infamous within their various spheres.

273
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:10,368
Speaker 1: Right.

274
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:14,343
Speaker 1: Well, it's like, you know, say John Carmack's walking down the road.

275
00:14:14,484 --> 00:14:15,834
Speaker 1: Most people are not going to know who he is.

276
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,366
Speaker 1: And if he opens his mouth, people are going to be like, oh, it's Professor Frank.

277
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,434
Speaker 1: Yeah, he talks.

278
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:26,119
Speaker 1: But if we see him walking down the road, I'd be like, whoa, it's a John Carmack over there in our industry.

279
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:26,340
Speaker 1: Right.

280
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,822
Speaker 1: So these people are all in, you know, the military, you know, law enforcement, you know, industry.

281
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,753
Speaker 1: So they know each other because they're all infamous badasses.

282
00:14:36,696 --> 00:14:46,695
Speaker 0: So the interesting thing, though, is that at least because every episode is pretty much standalone as a movie, even though it kind of reveals the greater world, you can't just go watch an episode.

283
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,748
Speaker 0: I wasn't going to say watch them out of order.

284
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,624
Speaker 0: I'm saying you can watch one episode and be totally satisfied.

285
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:53,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can do that.

286
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:56,019
Speaker 0: You don't need to wait for the next episode to come out.

287
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,024
Speaker 0: There are no cliffhangers.

288
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:58,109
Speaker 1: There's no cliffhangers.

289
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:58,390
Speaker 1: Right.

290
00:14:58,853 --> 00:14:59,074
Speaker 1: Yeah.

291
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:01,243
Speaker 1: It was each one is like a whole movie's worth.

292
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:01,725
Speaker 1: Right.

293
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:02,467
Speaker 1: It resolves.

294
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,374
Speaker 1: So, you know, there isn't.

295
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:08,229
Speaker 1: there isn't like, well, you know, continued in the next episode or anything like that.

296
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:20,172
Speaker 0: So if you're a fan of standalone complex, like the previous sets of Ghost in the Shell, what I would say is primarily different is that the world is much freer with crazy military technology.

297
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:30,663
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's to a greater point, like society is still a little lawless or there's still a lot of military hardware hanging around after the war.

298
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:39,228
Speaker 0: But I mean, in early episodes, bad guys have like military tanks and military shit and they're just blowing things up.

299
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,074
Speaker 0: Landmines everywhere.

300
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:43,704
Speaker 0: Oh, landmines look like prepubescent girls.

301
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:43,885
Speaker 1: Yeah.

302
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:50,114
Speaker 1: You know, maybe that could actually be a result of, you know, well, first of all, the political situation in the country at the time.

303
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:50,817
Speaker 1: Right.

304
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:53,872
Speaker 1: You know, they talk a bit about, you know, how things are kind of unstable.

305
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:57,892
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, the military is getting reorganized, which is like the backdrop for everything.

306
00:15:57,912 --> 00:15:58,374
Speaker 0: Right.

307
00:15:58,535 --> 00:16:01,126
Speaker 0: Every military group is basically trying to protect itself.

308
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:03,255
Speaker 0: A lot of people committed war crimes.

309
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:05,425
Speaker 0: It's shady shit during the actual war.

310
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:05,626
Speaker 0: Right.

311
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:17,997
Speaker 1: And you could almost, you know, say that, you know, all the difference in the world here in Arise versus the difference in standalone conflicts and other Ghost in the Shells is, you know, the results of the work of Section 9.

312
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:18,197
Speaker 1: Right.

313
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,503
Speaker 1: It's like they did a good job.

314
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:30,090
Speaker 1: Therefore, things became this way because watching this only then the cyber crimes they have to deal with are, you know, the only ones that are left are like super high level, amazing people hidden deep in the net.

315
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,410
Speaker 1: And all the things on the service level have sort of cleaned up, you know, by the major and team.

316
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:34,792
Speaker 0: Yeah.

317
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:41,275
Speaker 0: But it's interesting how pointed all of that is like the backdrop really fits with the way this show is working.

318
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:43,925
Speaker 0: Violence is the answer much more readily.

319
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:47,380
Speaker 0: And the plots are actually pretty straightforward because everyone's corrupt.

320
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:55,392
Speaker 0: I mean, when the major tricks the one politician in the car to spill in the beans, his beans are the smallest of beans.

321
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:57,560
Speaker 0: And it seems like everybody has a lot of beans.

322
00:16:58,641 --> 00:16:59,323
Speaker 0: Everybody.

323
00:16:59,343 --> 00:17:00,948
Speaker 0: Yeah.

324
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,238
Speaker 0: Granted, all they had to do was find the other coffin.

325
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:04,940
Speaker 0: They would have been good.

326
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,560
Speaker 1: Yeah.

327
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:07,267
Speaker 1: Well, it's not easy to find.

328
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:08,210
Speaker 1: It was right there.

329
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,319
Speaker 0: I carried this coffin around with me.

330
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:17,444
Speaker 0: I'm working on a meme mashup with that guy from Cowboy Bebop and this episode.

331
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,851
Speaker 1: How about also some Trigun in there?

332
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:20,773
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

333
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:27,400
Speaker 0: I could get to Mid Valley, not Mid Valley Horn Freak, Legato Blue Summers and carrying that coffin.

334
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:30,191
Speaker 0: Man, the Trigun manga is pretty fun.

335
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:35,633
Speaker 1: And you could also put in, maybe you could mix in the grave in Fist of the North Star.

336
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:37,240
Speaker 1: He's like, I dug this grave.

337
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,725
Speaker 1: He's going to make him fit in it.

338
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:42,296
Speaker 0: We'll see.

339
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:43,320
Speaker 0: I got to put that thing together.

340
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,181
Speaker 0: Yeah.

341
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:56,836
Speaker 0: The major is interesting in that she's still very recognizably her character, but she's a lot more openly surly and a lot more direct.

342
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,239
Speaker 0: She finds out a thing.

343
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:00,845
Speaker 0: She goes immediately straight at that thing.

344
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,053
Speaker 0: Also, she gets hacked.

345
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:05,176
Speaker 0: She's not 100% yet.

346
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,683
Speaker 0: She's not the goddess of hacking yet.

347
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:16,460
Speaker 1: Well, the body that she has here is not the body that she has for, I guess, the cyborg body that she has for most of the Ghost in the Shell story.

348
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,870
Speaker 0: Not the crazy military body.

349
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,152
Speaker 0: Right.

350
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:21,971
Speaker 1: It's not like she doesn't have the guns coming out of her arms and shit or anything like that.

351
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:22,332
Speaker 1: Right.

352
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:26,912
Speaker 1: It's just sort of a really good cyborg body she got from when she was in the military.

353
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:29,042
Speaker 1: And at the start, the military still owns it.

354
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:29,625
Speaker 1: Right.

355
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:30,168
Speaker 0: Yeah.

356
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,238
Speaker 0: In fact, the show makes a big deal about that too.

357
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:39,943
Speaker 0: They have all these nice subtle touches about how basically full body cyborgs are not really a thing outside of the military.

358
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,271
Speaker 0: People don't...

359
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,919
Speaker 1: Even in other Ghost in the Shells, it's like no one can afford that.

360
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,722
Speaker 1: Yeah.

361
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:46,827
Speaker 0: Ultra rich people can.

362
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:48,272
Speaker 0: It's out there.

363
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:52,008
Speaker 1: I mean, that's why you have people like even someone who owns a company like Jameson.

364
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,571
Speaker 1: Right.

365
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:54,480
Speaker 1: He's in a little tiny box because...

366
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,669
Speaker 0: Well, he prefers that body.

367
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,920
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, but that's the why.

368
00:18:58,023 --> 00:19:00,353
Speaker 1: If they do have a full body cyborg, they don't have a good one.

369
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:04,712
Speaker 1: It's not like the fact that the major is... That's true through all Ghost in the Shell.

370
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:04,953
Speaker 1: Right.

371
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:08,909
Speaker 1: That she basically always has the best possible cyborg body.

372
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,034
Speaker 1: that's a full cyborg body.

373
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:10,937
Speaker 1: No one could even tell.

374
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,846
Speaker 1: They'd be like, "Whoa, that's a full cyborg body.

375
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:13,228
Speaker 1: Holy

376
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:13,609
Speaker 1: shit.".

377
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:14,273
Speaker 1: Right?

378
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,384
Speaker 1: Because most full cyborg bodies are really crappy.

379
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:28,742
Speaker 0: But as a result, we get this interesting thing that actually fits with the old shows where they're really worried about personal freedom and personal attitude and the ability to fight for what they want and whatever and not being beholden to anyone except by consent.

380
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:34,215
Speaker 1: And control by being hacked because you have a computer.

381
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:44,905
Speaker 0: But in this one, there's all these characters want something and can't go after it because they work within an organization that's hobbled by bureaucracy.

382
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:58,388
Speaker 0: And basically, the story of Ghost in the Shell is, as it's always been, all the people who want justice and who are smart, band together to semi-legally pursue justice and do that via Batman.

383
00:19:58,408 --> 00:19:59,110
Speaker 0: Cyber Batman.

384
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:02,262
Speaker 0: Yes.

385
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,169
Speaker 0: That is the plot of Ghost in the Shell.

386
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,337
Speaker 0: But with a rise, it is open.

387
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:07,300
Speaker 0: It is out there.

388
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:09,485
Speaker 0: That is what they are doing.

389
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:10,748
Speaker 0: A hundred percent.

390
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:14,616
Speaker 0: The show is also ultra, ultra action.

391
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,160
Speaker 0: Very little.

392
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,799
Speaker 1: I think because it's an OAV, because you're getting so much time in there, right?

393
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,610
Speaker 1: It's like they got to fill it with awesome action scenes.

394
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:23,395
Speaker 1: You have a big budget.

395
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:24,040
Speaker 1: How do you blow it?

396
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,975
Speaker 0: And I think, apparently, in every episode, they're going to spend a lot of detail on one of the major's arms being blown off.

397
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:31,900
Speaker 1: That's how it goes.

398
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:33,474
Speaker 0: Two episodes in a row.

399
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:33,940
Speaker 0: Boom.

400
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,473
Speaker 0: But everyone's bodies get injured a lot.

401
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:43,020
Speaker 1: But when you have several bodies, that's something you can do that you couldn't do otherwise.

402
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,162
Speaker 1: So true.

403
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:50,927
Speaker 0: But in standalone complex, when someone needs to replace a part of their body, that's a big goddamn deal.

404
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:53,075
Speaker 0: And it kind of hobbles them for a while.

405
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:57,609
Speaker 0: And in this OAV, they pretty much are immediately fine.

406
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:14,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the major difference between this and the other Ghost in the Shells is that the, you know, the original Ghost in the Shell movie and even standalone complex, right, sort of has this really mysterious kind of thing like, ooh, what's going on in the net?

407
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:16,533
Speaker 1: Who's the laughing man?

408
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:22,676
Speaker 1: And it's like you'll get to the end of an episode and it won't be fully explained like what really happened there.

409
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:25,065
Speaker 1: We know most of it, but not all the details.

410
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:30,847
Speaker 1: And, you know, you got sort of like that cyber eeriness going on, right, where not everything's explained in this.

411
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:36,830
Speaker 1: Everything is literally and in plain text explained to you, except for the higher level meta.

412
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:37,453
Speaker 1: Right.

413
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,540
Speaker 1: Of course, they pretty much explain everything.

414
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,580
Speaker 1: Someone just says right out everything that happened in a given episode at some point.

415
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,102
Speaker 1: So nothing.

416
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:45,930
Speaker 1: It's not like what really happened.

417
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,042
Speaker 1: No, you just saw everything literally just happen, right?

418
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:53,395
Speaker 1: There's no eerie ness of like, hmm, what's what's going on?

419
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:54,980
Speaker 1: What's that guy up to?

420
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,505
Speaker 1: You know, there's no mystery whatsoever.

421
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:57,028
Speaker 1: Yep.

422
00:21:57,932 --> 00:22:03,113
Speaker 0: And coupled with the fact that there's no mystery, it doesn't read like it does a terrible secret of space either.

423
00:22:03,274 --> 00:22:13,850
Speaker 0: Well, other than the ones we already know about from other Ghost in the Shells or the sort of open questions of like what is going to happen in the future with this society?

424
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:21,513
Speaker 1: There's also very little that like you can see foreshadowing of things in other Ghost in the Shells.

425
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:21,714
Speaker 1: Right.

426
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:24,204
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, so there's these logic commas.

427
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:26,933
Speaker 1: Clearly they're touchy coma precursors.

428
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,422
Speaker 1: But it's only really blatant stuff like that.

429
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:36,849
Speaker 1: There's nothing else sort of like hinting at the laughing man or the puppeteer or any, you know, anything coming down the line.

430
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:40,884
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of reference to the puppeteer with a certain spy.

431
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:44,071
Speaker 1: I didn't notice any of the A.I.

432
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:46,236
Speaker 1: Maybe a little bit.

433
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:47,178
Speaker 1: Yeah.

434
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:47,759
Speaker 1: Yeah.

435
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:48,301
Speaker 1: I don't know that.

436
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:49,285
Speaker 0: That was definitely.

437
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:52,818
Speaker 0: But notice how that was inconceivable to them at that point.

438
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:53,180
Speaker 1: Sure.

439
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:54,421
Speaker 1: No.

440
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:55,064
Speaker 0: Yeah.

441
00:22:55,886 --> 00:22:57,571
Speaker 0: But it's interesting to watch the show.

442
00:22:57,592 --> 00:22:58,755
Speaker 0: I like it a lot.

443
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:07,168
Speaker 0: I don't like it as much as I liked actual standalone complex because it's missing a lot of the key elements that make standalone complex a standalone complex.

444
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:16,000
Speaker 0: It's not directed by Kenji Kamiyama, the new one, and the music in the new one is not the same kind of music as every other Ghost in the Shell.

445
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,420
Speaker 1: Yeah.

446
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,348
Speaker 1: The music's not that exciting.

447
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:22,745
Speaker 1: The music is very a lot like the Akira soundtrack where it's sort of like boom, boom, boom.

448
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:23,548
Speaker 1: Right.

449
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,692
Speaker 0: Which has its place.

450
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:25,936
Speaker 1: Chanting and some noises.

451
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:26,398
Speaker 1: Right.

452
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,150
Speaker 0: Mostly it's the opener is just really kind of milk toast.

453
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:34,887
Speaker 0: The opener to both standalone complexes just drives you crazy.

454
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:37,660
Speaker 0: Like you are pumped up and ready to jump off of buildings backwards.

455
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:38,581
Speaker 0: Yeah.

456
00:23:38,722 --> 00:23:46,608
Speaker 0: But then you watch this opener and you're like, can we just cyber butt past this opener and get back to the fighting in the show?

457
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:46,689
Speaker 0: Yep.

458
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,816
Speaker 0: Really like to get back to that.

459
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:52,628
Speaker 0: So I don't know much about the guy who directs this new one.

460
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:59,992
Speaker 0: I haven't really done much research on this yet because we're going to do a real review after we see the whole thing.

461
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:06,636
Speaker 0: I mean, if we reviewed standalone complex after a couple episodes, it's just a completely standalone procedural police drama.

462
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,539
Speaker 0: Yep.

463
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,342
Speaker 0: Which is awesome.

464
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:09,969
Speaker 1: You know, another seat, right?

465
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:11,093
Speaker 1: Stuff happens.

466
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:11,696
Speaker 1: So who knows?

467
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,691
Speaker 1: Maybe like the next episode will say to be continued or something like that.

468
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:15,093
Speaker 1: You don't know.

469
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:15,636
Speaker 1: Yeah.

470
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:16,320
Speaker 0: We don't know at all.

471
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:16,802
Speaker 0: Right.

472
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:22,770
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean, if you like Ghost in the Shell, you'll still like this and want to watch it after you've watched all the other Ghost in the Shells.

473
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:23,192
Speaker 0: Yep.

474
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:26,828
Speaker 0: But now I really just want to go back and watch standalone complex.

475
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,217
Speaker 0: I have this real urge to just watch.

476
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:30,482
Speaker 0: In fact, I watched an episode.

477
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:32,974
Speaker 0: Most of it's on YouTube for free legally, as far as I can tell.

478
00:24:32,994 --> 00:24:33,858
Speaker 1: How about that?

479
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:34,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

480
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,341
Speaker 1: Okay.

481
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,309
Speaker 1: Maybe this will be one day.

482
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,360
Speaker 0: If you're a fan of Ghost in the Shell, watch this however you can.

483
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:41,042
Speaker 0: It's up.

484
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:42,007
Speaker 0: It's in your wheelhouse.

485
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:43,695
Speaker 0: There's no other anime for you to watch.

486
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:44,640
Speaker 0: Kill La Kill is done.

487
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,047
Speaker 0: Monica was done a long time ago.

488
00:24:47,067 --> 00:24:49,377
Speaker 0: Attack on Titan has got a long time before.

489
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,623
Speaker 0: anything new is coming out with that.

490
00:24:50,663 --> 00:24:52,612
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon will be there for a long time.

491
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:53,496
Speaker 1: It's not going anywhere.

492
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:54,038
Speaker 0: Yep.

493
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:59,382
Speaker 0: Of course, if you don't watch it as it's trickling out, it might be hard to bite down on that 200 episode monster.

494
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:01,552
Speaker 1: I watched all of Fist of the North Star after it was all out.

495
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:02,035
Speaker 0: True.

496
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:07,238
Speaker 0: And then there's the new Sailor Moon, which that I'm going to watch as it comes out.

497
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:07,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.

498
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,791
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

499
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:20,993
