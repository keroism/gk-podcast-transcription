1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,133
Speaker 0: It's Monday April 3rd 2017.

2
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:12,936
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:15,705
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:16,106 --> 00:00:17,290
Speaker 0: build versus buy.

5
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:21,217
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:30,029
Speaker 1: Today is April 3rd Slash 3. it's big.

7
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:30,852
Speaker 1: It's a big day.

8
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:32,377
Speaker 1: First of all, it's 4/3 day.

9
00:00:35,382 --> 00:00:40,260
Speaker 1: So 4/3 day every year the micro 4/3 consortium has a contest.

10
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:49,892
Speaker 1: you take pictures on 4/3 day with a 4/3 camera and lens and Which I have and then you can submit it somehow and win something.

11
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:50,654
Speaker 1: I don't know.

12
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:51,617
Speaker 1: they just do this every year.

13
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:52,560
Speaker 1: All right, whatever.

14
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:55,909
Speaker 1: So that's the thing if you're a camera person.

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,920
Speaker 0: It's a. it's an inferior and obsolete aspect ratio.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,320
Speaker 1: I mean you can take a non 4/3 aspect ratio photo.

17
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:07,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just inferior for television.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,439
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah as an aspect ratio for watching things like this monitor is 16 by 10 for a reason.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,081
Speaker 1: Yeah No, it's.

20
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:16,269
Speaker 1: no we're not talking about video and TV.

21
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:17,493
Speaker 0: We're talking about 4/3 in all its forms.

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,986
Speaker 0: I guess there before colon 3.

23
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:23,799
Speaker 1: what's wrong with the 4/3 shape photograph versus it?

24
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:26,749
Speaker 1: You know, you know, you're a 16 by 9 photographs.

25
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:27,372
Speaker 1: really weird.

26
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:29,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, like one by one for photographs these days.

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure, but I mean different photographs are used for different kinds of different aspect photography different aspect ratios just for different compositions.

28
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:37,362
Speaker 1: It's not like.

29
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:48,940
Speaker 1: yeah, if you got a monitor that you're using to compute, you know a 1610 is useful But if you're watching video you want a 16 9 or even wider right for the which you would hate for using on your computer.

30
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe anyway.

31
00:01:51,141 --> 00:02:01,653
Speaker 1: Also today, I think technically the first day of baseball in 2017 was yesterday, but Mets baseball started today And seasons over we won six nothing.

32
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:06,018
Speaker 1: So if the season's over this fucking great Because that's not gonna last very long.

33
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:08,752
Speaker 1: So there's that.

34
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:12,636
Speaker 0: That's game I think I can go see a Mets game.

35
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,180
Speaker 1: It's real cheap.

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,580
Speaker 1: We can go whenever it is as long as we sit up high and we're waiting till it's warmer.

37
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't want to pay to sit down low.

38
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:29,055
Speaker 1: if we go on like a Wednesday afternoon You could go like like almost nothing Like, you know you sit in the outfield like zero dollars almost used to be back in the day.

39
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:29,356
Speaker 1: you could.

40
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:37,919
Speaker 1: in Shea Stadium They had like the Pepsi porch or whatever Perhaps know the Pepsi picnic area and you could bring like a can of Pepsi and just get in.

41
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:41,515
Speaker 0: When I was a kid Tiger Stadium had a very similar thing.

42
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:47,480
Speaker 0: where you could you could bring Various implements depending on who was sponsoring that stuff and get in for free or for a nickel.

43
00:02:48,063 --> 00:02:55,400
Speaker 1: I mean this was also cuz you know Shea Stadium had way more seats than Citi Field So they couldn't really fill it in except for you know, once the meds were not good.

44
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:07,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I'd been there in like the late 80s early 90s when it would fill but it didn't fill towards the late 90s 2000s, I don't think it filled and I don't think I saw it full at that point.

45
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:11,779
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'll also just recently I mean the Rangers clinched their.

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,169
Speaker 0: They declinched they.

47
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:24,436
Speaker 0: they clinched the non Participation of a hated team in the Stanley Cup playoffs and now nothing they do for the season matters.

48
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:28,234
Speaker 1: three meaningless hockey games And then the most real hockey game.

49
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:32,246
Speaker 1: Yeah Also hockey can.

50
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:40,220
Speaker 0: NHL confirmed it will not take a break during the Olympics Which is you know, I hate to say this but and it's Stanley Cup's a little more important than the Olympic hockey.

51
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,776
Speaker 0: I think Olympic hockey is the best though, but format of Olympic hockey is the best.

52
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:50,258
Speaker 1: with the wide Drinks players, I think players just gonna run away and go we'll say even while games are happening.

53
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:55,651
Speaker 1: They're just gonna go Definitely go and I don't think they could stop him.

54
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:57,520
Speaker 1: They just be like, why aren't you here at the game?

55
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,116
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are you gonna fire him?

56
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:00,703
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Mean you could just not.

57
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:03,215
Speaker 1: you could not pay him or suspend him and whatnot.

58
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:04,079
Speaker 1: He's like, I don't give a fuck.

59
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:11,974
Speaker 1: And Russia will probably win because they have KHL players Yeah, and the other countries all their players will be stuck in the NHL.

60
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:16,152
Speaker 0: Oh So you got any news and it's a. it's a Monday.

61
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,077
Speaker 1: I do have a news.

62
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:17,680
Speaker 1: it's tech news.

63
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,406
Speaker 1: So check this out.

64
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:24,292
Speaker 1: They announced there's the Consortium that decides things about RAM which I didn't even know existed.

65
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:26,880
Speaker 1: I didn't really understand how this worked until very recently.

66
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:33,000
Speaker 0: Oh, I I knew more about this but that was because I did a lot of research about it many years ago.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,315
Speaker 1: Like I never really thought about like who invents new kinds of RAM?

68
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:37,380
Speaker 1: who comes up with them, right?

69
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,071
Speaker 1: You need so many people to agree on this.

70
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:40,540
Speaker 1: It's obviously a consortium, right?

71
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,260
Speaker 1: You've got the motherboard makers the memory the RAM makers Intel, you know, everyone's got to get in on this.

72
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:49,760
Speaker 1: They make the same RAM work and all these different PCs.

73
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:53,015
Speaker 0: wasn't the thing with RAM bus and that already ran that they like.

74
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:58,180
Speaker 0: they had a Patent on something that was part of a consortium standard and something weird happened there.

75
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:15,954
Speaker 1: But anyway, the group that decides things about RAM has unveiled DDR 5 which is gonna be like way better than DDR 4 Way better, but you're probably not gonna see like if the final thing until like next year 2018 And you're not gonna be able to buy it on Newegg and put it in your computer.

76
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,501
Speaker 1: It's so probably 2019.

77
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:22,387
Speaker 0: This does more like 2020, you know in the main day We're not talking about building computers like this is.

78
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:24,153
Speaker 0: we're talking about everything but computers really.

79
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:40,026
Speaker 0: but in terms of Buying computers or building computers for the last many years There's this problem where every time you think I'll buy a computer because we're at a plateau If you look at websites like this, you're gonna say oh if I just wait one more generation I'm gonna get the crazy RAM.

80
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:41,954
Speaker 0: if I just wait one more generation.

81
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,279
Speaker 0: I'll get the crazy video card.

82
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:48,820
Speaker 0: Actually right now it's probably a real good time to buy because this shit you can get a crazy m2 drive right now.

83
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:52,937
Speaker 0: Yeah But this stuff is not gonna come out until next year or no.

84
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,389
Speaker 1: This probably won't come out for like two three years in.

85
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,360
Speaker 1: you know for your dude for you to buy.

86
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:03,623
Speaker 0: Yeah, but now is actually a real good plateau to buy a high-end computer For example.

87
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,053
Speaker 1: DDR4 was finalized in 2012.

88
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:08,322
Speaker 1: You couldn't put it in computer till 2015.

89
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:15,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's anyway, but yeah the organization that decides this is called JEDEC J E D E C. I didn't know that until today.

90
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,012
Speaker 1: But what's other interesting news that Intel has these obtained?

91
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:21,700
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there's like the cash drives, right?

92
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,059
Speaker 1: So these obtained things are basically somewhere between a RAM and an SSD.

93
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:38,820
Speaker 0: so it's like I Where they'd have like an SSD or some RAM or something in the drive and then they'd have a spinning disk for the bulk store.

94
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,204
Speaker 1: Right, but there's no spinning disk no more.

95
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:41,729
Speaker 1: So basically these obtained drives.

96
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:45,600
Speaker 1: They're slower than RAM, but they're not that slower than RAM.

97
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,891
Speaker 1: They're like ten times slower, but RAM is so fast.

98
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:57,520
Speaker 1: It's still ridiculous speed and The idea is that well, you know for a lot of stuff like that's fast enough and it doesn't erase because it's solid state.

99
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:59,472
Speaker 1: So like, you know, it's crazy fast.

100
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:06,960
Speaker 1: ish not as RAM fast But fast and it doesn't clear when you turn the computer off like RAM does because the way RAM works people don't realize this.

101
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:10,112
Speaker 0: It's basic capacitors and you keep going.

102
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:11,056
Speaker 0: Hey, don't forget.

103
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:11,618
Speaker 0: Don't forget.

104
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,392
Speaker 1: Don't forget No, it's their capacitors that are like charged up right.

105
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:17,459
Speaker 1: and then now that's that's how you hold a one in there.

106
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,331
Speaker 1: But and then you know, you don't keep electricity going into it.

107
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:22,274
Speaker 1: It drains out.

108
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,400
Speaker 1: That's what a capacitor does, right?

109
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,640
Speaker 1: It's sort of like a battery that only doesn't last forever, right?

110
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,923
Speaker 1: It didn't you?

111
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:36,099
Speaker 1: so a RAM is just a huge grid of capacitors Whereas solid-state is actually a thing that switches and stays switched.

112
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,300
Speaker 1: But that'll be really interesting.

113
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:46,834
Speaker 1: Like if you could maybe these obtained things like you could suspend your computer and like turn it on But like everything's already in RAM, so it turns on.

114
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:51,675
Speaker 0: even it turns on like a TV Computer already boots in under three seconds.

115
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:52,980
Speaker 1: We're talking like it doesn't even boot.

116
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,483
Speaker 1: It's like you.

117
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:56,157
Speaker 1: you you think you just turned your monitor on like boom.

118
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:56,599
Speaker 1: There it is.

119
00:07:57,322 --> 00:08:00,110
Speaker 1: But actually no your computer was off and is now on.

120
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:11,492
Speaker 0: like I'm saying it's it's a hell of a time for computers because already now Super fast like m.2 form factor SSDs are actually really affordable like if you're buying a fancy computer like.

121
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:12,439
Speaker 0: there's a reason I bought a.

122
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:23,372
Speaker 1: Maybe like if you had RAM and an optane drive and the optane drive was so big you could just like have your Applications just like every like you don't install applications you like.

123
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:28,689
Speaker 1: you just load them and they're just always loaded I'm sure in applications.

124
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:31,300
Speaker 1: They're just every application on your whole computer is always open.

125
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:48,640
Speaker 0: Well, I'm pretty sure that the optane right now the ones that consumers are going to be getting as they like launch aren't the super High-capacity like I don't know because I have a. you can get a two terabyte SSD from Samsung like today if you want it sure, but I'm saying like that's normal people don't need that.

126
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,366
Speaker 1: This is the road.

127
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:50,455
Speaker 1: We could be going down.

128
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:52,044
Speaker 0: This is a road We're gonna be going down.

129
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:52,446
Speaker 0: come on.

130
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,691
Speaker 0: years are about computers.

131
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:54,354
Speaker 0: keep getting in the 2020s.

132
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,043
Speaker 1: That's the kind of computer you're gonna be looking at something where it's just like You know.

133
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:00,705
Speaker 1: like you'll.

134
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:04,140
Speaker 1: you'll be looking at the SSD the way we look at like the spinning does now.

135
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:05,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just like.

136
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:10,893
Speaker 1: no my computer's like a hundred percent RAM and is a wafer thin And I mean we don't throw away some of this stuff like.

137
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,022
Speaker 0: I mean I still haven't spinning discs But they serve.

138
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:24,288
Speaker 0: they've replaced NASA's for me sure anyway, so in some other news This I don't know if anyone cares about this But you always complains got about.

139
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:26,538
Speaker 0: most of what we talk about is business news and not tech news.

140
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:26,880
Speaker 1: That's right.

141
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,150
Speaker 1: I just heard about actual tech news technologies.

142
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,440
Speaker 0: This is some legitimate tech news.

143
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:42,419
Speaker 0: Firefox is Dropping or has dropped also support, so if you use also In the raw or this is only a Linux issue by the way anyone listening is know what the hell's going on.

144
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:43,546
Speaker 0: Well, I did that poll.

145
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:51,000
Speaker 0: I was like pulse audio Also, Jack D for some reason or what the fuck rim and what the fuck rim won by a lot.

146
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically you know if you have windows.

147
00:09:53,148 --> 00:09:54,233
Speaker 1: You don't or Mac.

148
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:56,120
Speaker 1: You don't think about like the sound system.

149
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,600
Speaker 1: It's just like there's sound sound plays.

150
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:06,351
Speaker 0: It works like if you if you have a complicated computer you think oh I have weird sound devices And I have to set a priority order for which one.

151
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:08,040
Speaker 1: but like you just open the mixer or whatever.

152
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,100
Speaker 1: But you don't think about the sound system itself like how that's coded.

153
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:13,128
Speaker 1: But in Linux you know that's.

154
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:16,780
Speaker 1: you have to choose one and like install it and set it up And there's different choices.

155
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:18,546
Speaker 0: You know who thinks about this a lot.

156
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:22,019
Speaker 1: we taught it listen to the oldest possible geek night like OSS.

157
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,919
Speaker 1: I know and you'll hear talk about this stuff wasn't it OSS?

158
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:33,020
Speaker 1: And then also was like they used to be open sound system Yeah, and then there was also and now this pulse audio is like the new the relatively new hotness.

159
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,176
Speaker 0: But yet I was pretty sure that pulse audio was based on or relied on all.

160
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:39,846
Speaker 1: since I'm no I I don't know because I haven't used it.

161
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:41,673
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm still not super clear on this.

162
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:46,832
Speaker 0: meanwhile when I had a Gentoo box I'd use Jack because I was running real.

163
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:48,538
Speaker 0: I was running our door and resound.

164
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,332
Speaker 0: I needed a real-time system.

165
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:55,934
Speaker 0: to this day I cannot really understand how to use any of the functionality of Jack.

166
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:56,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't understand any.

167
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:57,960
Speaker 0: I never understood it.

168
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:58,473
Speaker 0: It makes no sense.

169
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:06,786
Speaker 0: I installed a bunch of stuff and I kept fucking with configuration files until eventually our door and resound both worked And then I never touched it again.

170
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:10,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you want to write a computer program that plays sound.

171
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,105
Speaker 1: Right it's like you.

172
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:17,440
Speaker 1: pretty much just get a library that handles it for you like DirectX cuz comes with direct sound.

173
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:24,300
Speaker 1: The case SDL has a sound thingy that lets you play sounds, you know, but generally you're just playing wav files.

174
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,771
Speaker 1: You're saying wav file send.

175
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:26,537
Speaker 1: Okay, it played.

176
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:26,900
Speaker 1: I'm good.

177
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,743
Speaker 0: There is a place.

178
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:34,946
Speaker 1: even even really fancy programs like say counter-strike our program pretty much that way where they Have wav files and they send them.

179
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:39,360
Speaker 0: So what I was getting at is actually most like bigger-tier modern gaming.

180
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:47,360
Speaker 0: There's been a shift over the last many years toward using Dedicated proprietary audio middleware in game design instead of playing sounds directly, right?

181
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,600
Speaker 1: But the point is imagine having to write that dedicated audio middleware.

182
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:50,821
Speaker 1: That's.

183
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:51,363
Speaker 1: that's.

184
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,993
Speaker 1: that's what this pulse audio also stuff is.

185
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:55,940
Speaker 1: is that kind of that level of code?

186
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,762
Speaker 0: That is also.

187
00:11:56,842 --> 00:12:03,740
Speaker 0: what the main bit is going to be about is whether or not you should write all this complicated shit to play In layer audio files in a game anyway.

188
00:12:04,503 --> 00:12:09,100
Speaker 1: So Firefox is removing support for also for they're only gonna use pulse audio.

189
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:18,192
Speaker 1: So if you have a desktop Linux and you want to use Firefox and you want to hear sound when you're say watching a YouTube Video your Fox you have to use pulse audio or you're gonna hear nothing.

190
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:20,300
Speaker 1: You have no choice pulse audio or bust.

191
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:31,830
Speaker 0: So as far as I can tell the only people on earth who are complaining about this are the people in this slash-dot thread And it's amazing that there are people who are so mad

192
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:38,660
Speaker 1: because if you were writing Firefox it for Linux something which doesn't have You know a ridiculous number of users, but it has enough where they got to keep doing it.

193
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,016
Speaker 1: Yeah is are like such a pain in the ass is also shit.

194
00:12:42,056 --> 00:12:42,920
Speaker 1: Let's just stick to one.

195
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:44,259
Speaker 1: Okay, we can actually do this.

196
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:52,736
Speaker 0: The best part is this jerk here is like all you need to do is the dash dash enable also configure option and then the Immediate response is actually no that's the thing that's going away.

197
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,498
Speaker 1: Yep That's the thing that's going away.

198
00:12:54,961 --> 00:13:03,629
Speaker 0: But call but quote with pulse audio being criminally broken case in point doesn't work on the box I sit my butt at right now.

199
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,916
Speaker 0: at the moment what you got?

200
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:07,766
Speaker 0: some like Special gen 2 build.

201
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:08,450
Speaker 0: you're running there.

202
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,492
Speaker 0: I don't know but the point is sound Gen 2 won't notice if you're running gen 2 the e-bill.

203
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:14,075
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever.

204
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:15,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I already don't care.

205
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,731
Speaker 1: The point is sound in Linux has always sucked.

206
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,260
Speaker 1: It sucked since I wrote about surround sound not working.

207
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,587
Speaker 1: There's a blog post I wrote somewhere about surround sound and Linux not working.

208
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,674
Speaker 1: and like still 2000 something early 2000 and guess what?

209
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,871
Speaker 1: She still don't work.

210
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:44,880
Speaker 0: Yep So that's why and like I was driven away to Linux on the desktop from Windows for a lot of reasons I use Linux on the desktop for a long time but Windows and OS X are the only modern desktop operating systems.

211
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,933
Speaker 1: The thing is even among Windows and OS X sound has a lot of issues Yeah, but at least it you can get it to work.

212
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:53,563
Speaker 1: on Linux a lot of times You're just like rough.

213
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:54,447
Speaker 1: I can't do it.

214
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:57,200
Speaker 1: But on Windows, it's like it sucks, but you can make it happen.

215
00:13:57,783 --> 00:14:02,302
Speaker 0: well, the thing is the only things you can't make happen on Windows are Complicated things.

216
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:02,924
Speaker 0: where again?

217
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:04,529
Speaker 1: No, there's a very simple thing.

218
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:07,860
Speaker 1: You can't do which is play one sound thing out of two out holes.

219
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:11,304
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, if I have two sound cards I just want to play the same.

220
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:15,599
Speaker 1: I want to open up iTunes play music and have it go to both sound cards out at the same time.

221
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:17,666
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons why that would.

222
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:24,987
Speaker 1: unless those two sound cards have a unified timing mechanism Which they put if I don't care if they're in sync I just want the sound to just go out both holes.

223
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:26,553
Speaker 0: that why do so?

224
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:28,319
Speaker 0: why would you want to do that?

225
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,789
Speaker 1: There's a lot of reasons.

226
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:36,260
Speaker 1: maybe I got you know I said his speakers in one room instead of speakers another room and using that's where you use and your audio splitter.

227
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:39,782
Speaker 1: I'm just saying there's a Amplifier.

228
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:40,927
Speaker 1: there are legit reasons.

229
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:41,810
Speaker 1: Don't want to do this.

230
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,080
Speaker 1: Yes, there are there a lot of you know, you can't do it.

231
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,960
Speaker 0: There's no legit reason you would want to do that.

232
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,868
Speaker 1: I want to send it to my headphones and also speak.

233
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:48,490
Speaker 0: now.

234
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:54,600
Speaker 0: I can do that on my computer right now Because I'm using a giant mixer right here.

235
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,100
Speaker 1: So you send your sound out of your computer through one hole the mixer and then on your mixer you have multiple holes.

236
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:01,029
Speaker 1: That's cheap.

237
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:02,100
Speaker 1: That's no different than a splitter.

238
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:07,697
Speaker 0: But I can have audio from the mixer coming back into the computer and back out of other holes.

239
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:10,186
Speaker 0: so I can in effect Have playaway file.

240
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:14,503
Speaker 0: have it go out like ten different places analog and digital Plus.

241
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:17,860
Speaker 1: it would get out of saying the windows is still only sending out the same reason.

242
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,703
Speaker 1: I think it's only.

243
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,678
Speaker 1: Windows itself is still only sending the audio from one application to one hole.

244
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:23,180
Speaker 0: now.

245
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:32,715
Speaker 0: Also you as far as Windows knows that the reason that things don't let you do that is the same reason why you can't record In any application from two different sound cards at the same time.

246
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:34,764
Speaker 0: Ah, yep There's reasons for that.

247
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:36,149
Speaker 0: that she won't work in Linux either.

248
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,615
Speaker 1: Did you just let you do it?

249
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,825
Speaker 0: No good now Not.

250
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:40,754
Speaker 0: let people do that.

251
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,279
Speaker 1: Let it do it.

252
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:47,000
Speaker 0: Also don't cater to the edge case because it'll just make your application harder to use for the vast majority of humans.

253
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:47,964
Speaker 0: Fuck the edge case.

254
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:49,048
Speaker 0: They can buy their own software.

255
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:49,790
Speaker 0: They can write their own.

256
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,035
Speaker 1: Here's an example, right?

257
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:52,360
Speaker 1: I got winamp open.

258
00:15:52,905 --> 00:16:02,596
Speaker 1: I want to play a music in winamp But I also want the winamp music to be sent out a different hole to someone I'm skyping Can't do it.

259
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:05,300
Speaker 0: Just tell Skype to take the input.

260
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:10,440
Speaker 0: That is the output of your winamp if you're using some sort of but then I can't hear the Skype on my speaker.

261
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:12,178
Speaker 1: Well, I also want to send it to my store again.

262
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:15,159
Speaker 0: If you're the edge case, I can just do that.

263
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:18,170
Speaker 1: I'm just saying but you can do that but Windows doesn't do it.

264
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:18,772
Speaker 1: You wouldn't?

265
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:20,860
Speaker 0: there's no reason windows have to do that.

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,660
Speaker 1: Buy a multi-thousand dollar piece of equipment to do that.

267
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:30,990
Speaker 0: repeating of People who use windows do not need to do the.

268
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:35,218
Speaker 1: there are actually people selling like weird Unshady software is to do this.

269
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,471
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that shady software sucks ass is also probably full of malware.

270
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:43,767
Speaker 0: if there was a legitimate use case Cases would sell that software.

271
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:45,373
Speaker 1: legitimate use case want to do that.

272
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:47,080
Speaker 1: don't want to spend a bunch of money on hardware.

273
00:16:48,143 --> 00:16:50,508
Speaker 0: Actually wanted to do that any time when.

274
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:54,398
Speaker 0: many times when give me our use case you actually these case.

275
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:55,000
Speaker 0: you.

276
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,687
Speaker 0: yeah I doubt your use cases or something.

277
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:58,295
Speaker 0: You've actually wanted to do in the real world.

278
00:16:58,395 --> 00:16:59,420
Speaker 1: I just use these case.

279
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,400
Speaker 1: I wanted to have a music play send it to Skype and also would you send music to Skype?

280
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,890
Speaker 1: I want to play music for somebody would know you don't.

281
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,243
Speaker 1: I want to play music in counter-strike to harass people But also listen to it.

282
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:11,709
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, you know what?

283
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:14,397
Speaker 0: in that case you buy this troll app that I've seen.

284
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:16,499
Speaker 1: No bitcoins no.

285
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:31,553
Speaker 0: actually when we were playing the old days with our NS I used a set of scripts and what those scripts would do is take away files and route them as Audio from a fake microphone interface and I got banned from a bunch of servers.

286
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,395
Speaker 0: then I stopped using it.

287
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,347
Speaker 1: I Got three Apple twos and I want to.

288
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:43,740
Speaker 1: I don't have a cassette tape recorder and I want to play the same You know data file to all three at the same audio splitter.

289
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:54,239
Speaker 1: I'm just saying the answer to almost any one of them has an optical in and the other one has an analog optical in on your Apple - I'm sure someone does.

290
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:11,230
Speaker 1: You should see this shit people guy I seen Apple twos running Wolfenstein 3d but anyway things Of the day, what do you got?

291
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:15,150
Speaker 1: So, I don't know who set this up or where they got their data from but it exists.

292
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:18,625
Speaker 1: And even though it's you might think it's an anime day thing.

293
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:19,610
Speaker 1: It's a technology thing.

294
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:28,530
Speaker 1: So what this is, I guess instead of setting up a website that was like Studio Ghibli database They just set up an API so they didn't have to make a website.

295
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:35,370
Speaker 1: So if you use you know, it's a restful API that sends back JSON and they have a database full of Ghibli information.

296
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:40,287
Speaker 1: You know, I'm sure this information is on IMDB, but whatever so interesting because I'm just.

297
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,418
Speaker 0: I'm literally right now Because I'm doing a lot.

298
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:44,010
Speaker 0: I'm architecting a lot of big projects.

299
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:52,050
Speaker 0: So I'm reading this book on like the current state-of-the-art best practices for restful like interfaces for website stuff.

300
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:53,874
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm this seems to follow pretty.

301
00:18:53,894 --> 00:19:01,508
Speaker 0: this looks like the kind of thing that I would write if I were trying to like make sure that I know how this stuff works by reading that book and then making a good rest.

302
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:14,488
Speaker 1: so not only is this a Very useful API if you want to know about Ghibli things or maybe write some kind of app that needs Ghibli data But also a really example of a well-designed standard.

303
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:17,196
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's actually well-designed.

304
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:17,838
Speaker 1: Well, it's.

305
00:19:17,978 --> 00:19:22,230
Speaker 1: it's a pretty easy to make this kind of API because it's only forgetting data, right?

306
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,049
Speaker 1: It's not an API where you have to like post or submit anything.

307
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:29,370
Speaker 1: It's real simple to make one of these because every call is a hundred percent independent.

308
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:31,758
Speaker 1: All your it's just selects it just selecting from.

309
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:40,367
Speaker 1: they have a database of Ghibli stuff and you select from it and effectively Just instead of sending them SQL you send them HTTP because instead of them sending you SQL results.

310
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:47,630
Speaker 0: They send you JSON strings and a Book is basically like as soon as you start doing more complicated stuff.

311
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:55,219
Speaker 0: Most things that say they're a rest interface don't actually follow restful principles No And are actually basically just garbage old like it's.

312
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,204
Speaker 1: cuz restful principles are like don't?

313
00:19:57,344 --> 00:20:02,020
Speaker 1: you don't exactly match You know designs of modern applications.

314
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,330
Speaker 1: You can't really can't follow them necessarily.

315
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,730
Speaker 0: You're kind of limited by the fact that we're still using HTTP, right?

316
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,907
Speaker 1: I mean if you if you make something that follows because HD I'm not gonna talk about HTTP.

317
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:12,609
Speaker 1: That's a different show.

318
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:26,468
Speaker 1: But yeah If you make something on that if you make something and you're if your application matches the sort of design for the original You know Tim Berners-Lee HTTP, then restful is gonna work really well for you.

319
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:42,070
Speaker 1: But if your application sort of like a normal kind of like a Twitter thing, you know, it's like yeah restful Mostly matches up but it's like, you know, all you have is put post delete, you know And some of the weird new ones that might not work.

320
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can give get put post and delete and none of those are login.

321
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:49,290
Speaker 1: You're gonna use post for login, even though that's not what post is, right?

322
00:20:49,951 --> 00:21:01,041
Speaker 0: For example, so but yeah If you're an aspiring programmer Poking at an API like this and trying to make it like trying to take the data into a little application And do something with it or like display it on a web page.

323
00:21:01,422 --> 00:21:07,430
Speaker 0: That's like the best way to learn this stuff Because someone else did the annoying work of make a useful set of data.

324
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:10,710
Speaker 0: All you have to do is be like I'm gonna make a website where I type a word.

325
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,903
Speaker 0: It shows me all the Ghibli movies that appears in like.

326
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:21,288
Speaker 1: this would be really useful if for example, you wanted to make like a Automatic Ghibli trivia generator or yeah something like that.

327
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,579
Speaker 0: Name Baron Humperd von Gekengen.

328
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,826
Speaker 0: gender male hair color yellow eye color green.

329
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:28,070
Speaker 1: Is that from Forco Rosso?

330
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:29,557
Speaker 0: Or is that the?

331
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,130
Speaker 1: is that the guy from Lapada?

332
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:35,930
Speaker 0: I think it's a guy from Lapada, but I don't remember any of the names of any of those people.

333
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,593
Speaker 1: I don't know anything.

334
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:37,938
Speaker 0: All right, you know who?

335
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,810
Speaker 0: Ronaldo moon aka moon aka Muta.

336
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,309
Speaker 0: male beige hair white eyes.

337
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:48,036
Speaker 0: No, you know who Gigi is.

338
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,567
Speaker 0: or cat bus cat bus, you know, I know a cat buses.

339
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:52,390
Speaker 0: hair color brown.

340
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,498
Speaker 0: I feel like actually how cat bus has multiple.

341
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:57,309
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I'm not gonna quibble about the data set.

342
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:08,503
Speaker 0: So When I was young I like most nerds who played Dungeons & Dragons Thought oh I have all these pewter or relitium.

343
00:22:08,523 --> 00:22:10,128
Speaker 0: I guess no one has relitium anymore.

344
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:10,750
Speaker 0: miniatures.

345
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:12,723
Speaker 0: I didn't have miniatures.

346
00:22:12,744 --> 00:22:19,370
Speaker 0: I Well, I did but also our game master like painted them legit and one thing he did that was super cool.

347
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,094
Speaker 0: It's him and his brother.

348
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:22,930
Speaker 1: Did he actually paint him legit or were you just young?

349
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,317
Speaker 1: He didn't know what it was.

350
00:22:24,337 --> 00:22:25,323
Speaker 0: He was real good at this shit.

351
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:31,097
Speaker 1: It's like I used to see miniatures I thought were good like in the game store and then you go online and then the ones in the game store on the shelf Look like crap.

352
00:22:31,178 --> 00:22:40,890
Speaker 0: These were legit good He was limited only by the fact that these were the tiny like one-inch scale ones, but they look real fucking good Mm-hmm, and he painted all our main characters for those super long campaigns.

353
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:46,550
Speaker 0: So I thought I'm gonna totally get into this hobby and I tried to paint miniatures and they looked like god.

354
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,590
Speaker 1: I always want to do the free paint and take it packs.

355
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:59,342
Speaker 0: I've had 21 opportunities to do so and I've done it zero times Yep, so then I read a whole bunch of tutorials in dragon magazine And then I tried again and they were still garbage.

356
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:01,050
Speaker 0: and then I read a whole bunch more tutorials.

357
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:06,570
Speaker 0: They were still garbage and I watched him do it and I tried to do what he did and still look like garbage.

358
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,722
Speaker 1: I thought about painting Gundam models and then I gave up.

359
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:11,250
Speaker 0: the moral is don't paint your miniatures You're gonna suck at it forever.

360
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:19,255
Speaker 0: But if you insist on painting them or if you're good at it if you insist on doing this Thin your paints.

361
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:21,823
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, if you do not thin your paints.

362
00:23:22,446 --> 00:23:23,549
Speaker 0: This is what happens.

363
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:28,345
Speaker 1: And also you're gonna paint that they sell is not thin enough.

364
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:31,530
Speaker 1: when they sell it to you You must make it thinner with paint thinner.

365
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:34,810
Speaker 0: There are reasons you might want to use thicker paints in certain situations.

366
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:38,590
Speaker 0: None of those reasons apply to you and you're wrong if you think otherwise.

367
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:42,570
Speaker 1: Also, if you're using an airbrush, you need to get it thinner or it'll gob up the airbrush.

368
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:46,070
Speaker 1: They make it's like mandatory to thin it to go in the airbrush.

369
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:49,130
Speaker 0: This is a public service announcement about why you need to thin your paints.

370
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:51,320
Speaker 0: But more importantly I have a piece of advice.

371
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:52,345
Speaker 0: is not in this video.

372
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:57,410
Speaker 0: piece of advice number two If you somehow start painting the paint, yeah, that's number three.

373
00:23:58,531 --> 00:24:01,730
Speaker 0: Also on number four most of those old miniatures are made out of lead.

374
00:24:02,352 --> 00:24:03,677
Speaker 1: So don't eat the miniature.

375
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:07,230
Speaker 0: be aware of that, especially if you're handling them playing D&D and eating your Cheetos.

376
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:10,466
Speaker 0: That's why they had relitium which doesn't have lead in it, but sucks.

377
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:13,074
Speaker 1: get plastic It's just fine.

378
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:13,455
Speaker 0: Yeah.

379
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:18,010
Speaker 1: Well, I like the pewter like heavy miniatures get a plastic one with a weight in the middle of it.

380
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:27,819
Speaker 0: But my second most important piece of advice is if you get even the most minuscule amount into this hobby and start painting miniatures Someone at some point is gonna say yo dog.

381
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:33,261
Speaker 0: You got an ink to make stuff look real good You're going to fail and inking is super hard.

382
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:34,907
Speaker 0: Don't even do not try to ink.

383
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:38,409
Speaker 0: you're gonna take What is a perfectly serviceable miniature and ruin it?

384
00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:47,512
Speaker 0: They're gonna try to get that ink off of there and you're gonna make it even worse Mm-hmm, and then your hand is gonna be black for like a month and your fingernails gonna have black ink under it for the rest Of your life.

385
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,402
Speaker 0: That is my experience with inking.

386
00:24:49,644 --> 00:24:57,665
Speaker 0: do not ink your miniatures In the moment the book club book is Frank Gerberts do not do like a sand dune.

387
00:24:57,685 --> 00:25:01,076
Speaker 0: Yep Spice and such.

388
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:02,081
Speaker 0: we're gonna read it at some point.

389
00:25:02,122 --> 00:25:03,590
Speaker 0: I kind of has been busy playing Zelda.

390
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:09,682
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'll read it when I finish playing Zelda Just when I'm gonna do everything else in my life when I finish playing.

391
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:15,060
Speaker 0: so as long as we're on the same boat here Because I'm not gonna stop playing Zelda anytime soon.

392
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:25,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if I have free time the geek nights video game Yeah side geek fight, you know, you're not allowed to play Breath of the Wild unless you play Zelda 1 first.

393
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:27,113
Speaker 1: cuz I say so You know what?

394
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:29,079
Speaker 0: If you play Zelda 1 first, you're.

395
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,450
Speaker 0: there's some areas of Breath of the Wild that are shockingly reminiscent.

396
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:38,829
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a rectangular island that sort of you got to get to with a raft and the northern east of the map.

397
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:43,333
Speaker 1: in both Games, it's also based on some Spectacle rock.

398
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:46,221
Speaker 1: in both games is the old man who wears red.

399
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:50,332
Speaker 0: in both games wand of Gamelon appears to be canon Really?

400
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:55,466
Speaker 0: There's there's a big skeleton in a wand of Gamelon of this thing like in a desert area.

401
00:25:55,486 --> 00:25:57,674
Speaker 1: the same skeleton I just I just saw.

402
00:25:57,694 --> 00:26:00,750
Speaker 0: that's going and the same landscape is in Breath of the Wild.

403
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:06,528
Speaker 0: So danger for the CGI Zelda's being canon.

404
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:08,662
Speaker 0: maybe There's no way.

405
00:26:08,682 --> 00:26:11,156
Speaker 0: it's a coincidence Cuz it's too close.

406
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:13,870
Speaker 0: But otherwise the previous book club was Rebecca.

407
00:26:14,812 --> 00:26:15,314
Speaker 0: We got no cuz.

408
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:18,470
Speaker 0: I guess I'm gonna be a Zenkai Khan at the end of the month doing some panels.

409
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:20,197
Speaker 0: I don't know what but I'm doing panels.

410
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:22,949
Speaker 0: I assume they're Saturday and Sunday because I didn't take Friday off work.

411
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:27,870
Speaker 0: Then we got PAX West, PAX Unplugged, PAX Australia.

412
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:31,460
Speaker 0: Geek nights will be at all of them.

413
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,604
Speaker 1: Sure.

414
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:34,189
Speaker 0: All of them is happening.

415
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,499
Speaker 0: and Yeah, I don't know.

416
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,470
Speaker 0: follow our YouTube channels.

417
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:42,246
Speaker 0: If you guys double the number of YouTube subscribers on either of our channels.

418
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:46,160
Speaker 1: if you get me above 10,000 I don't know how many I have them.

419
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:46,522
Speaker 0: I have.

420
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:47,728
Speaker 0: no I don't know how many you have either.

421
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:54,489
Speaker 0: right now YouTube slash a French you have.

422
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:57,406
Speaker 0: The problem is we're using our separate YouTube channels.

423
00:26:57,748 --> 00:27:01,219
Speaker 1: You have 1438 so 2,800 would be double.

424
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,785
Speaker 0: so you need you need 10,000.

425
00:27:02,785 --> 00:27:04,392
Speaker 1: surprised to have that many You have.

426
00:27:04,412 --> 00:27:07,203
Speaker 0: you have a good YouTube channel your pot your most popular of those.

427
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:08,930
Speaker 0: still two pony things.

428
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:11,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, my most popular.

429
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,369
Speaker 1: No, I thought bike commuting was my most popular bike.

430
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:19,209
Speaker 0: Nope Oh my gosh is a little bit more is an order of magnitude more popular Than either of them.

431
00:27:20,511 --> 00:27:27,870
Speaker 0: My gosh, my number one video is my Kanye pony video to this day All right, and my number two video is that Game of Thrones goonies mashup?

432
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,729
Speaker 0: I made mmm, but it gave me above 10,000 and I can get some shit out of YouTube.

433
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,119
Speaker 1: It used to be one of those silver play buttons.

434
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,070
Speaker 0: I think I need I don't know what I need for the silver play button.

435
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,157
Speaker 0: I think you need a hundred thousand.

436
00:27:41,177 --> 00:27:42,523
Speaker 1: You just want the silver play button.

437
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:43,749
Speaker 0: I bet I could just buy one.

438
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,763
Speaker 0: Let's see, I need a hundred thousand to get the silver play button.

439
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:49,405
Speaker 1: Okay.

440
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:50,610
Speaker 0: Wonder if I could just buy one.

441
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:54,176
Speaker 1: Let's see on eBay It won't have your channel name on it.

442
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:55,622
Speaker 1: It'll be like for some other channel.

443
00:27:55,702 --> 00:27:59,794
Speaker 0: I'll get it to say Chester Pocklington YouTube play button.

444
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:00,316
Speaker 1: Yeah.

445
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:02,966
Speaker 1: Oh, so yeah, there was a cooking contest.

446
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:03,990
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's making fake ones.

447
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, people are making bootleg ones.

448
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:05,899
Speaker 1: Nice.

449
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,541
Speaker 0: Yeah.

450
00:28:06,682 --> 00:28:07,566
Speaker 1: Anyway game.

451
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:12,424
Speaker 1: so There's a cooking contest I had to make a video for.

452
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:15,515
Speaker 1: so we made the video On Sunday Saturday.

453
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:16,418
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

454
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,703
Speaker 0: We made a cooking video.

455
00:28:17,723 --> 00:28:18,325
Speaker 0: Scott cooked.

456
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:19,890
Speaker 1: It's due on Wednesday.

457
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:20,935
Speaker 1: The contest closes.

458
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:22,865
Speaker 1: so I get it completely edited.

459
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:24,596
Speaker 1: morning or Wednesday midnight I don't know but I have to.

460
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:34,625
Speaker 1: I'm gonna finish the whole thing tonight Editing and I'm gonna upload it to YouTube when I wake up tomorrow and this I'll be cooking with Scott episode one Even if I don't win the contest, which I don't expect to do.

461
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:35,590
Speaker 1: so, I'm gonna be honest.

462
00:28:35,891 --> 00:28:39,850
Speaker 1: I was planning on doing cooking with Scott anyway, but the contest sort of forced me to do it.

463
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:44,144
Speaker 0: Legit honest because I had to stand there silently working the handcam when Scott.

464
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:47,360
Speaker 0: we had a couple other cameras set up and basically like Well, you know manage all that crap.

465
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:48,610
Speaker 0: Keep an eye on the levels.

466
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:55,950
Speaker 0: It was legit entertaining to watch Scott cook even without editing out all the parts where we just stood there We're gonna edit out a lot of weight.

467
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,844
Speaker 1: There's a lot of times you're just waiting for stuff to cook.

468
00:28:57,864 --> 00:28:58,690
Speaker 1: we're gonna edit all that out.

469
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,739
Speaker 0: But there's also a lot of parts where you're legit funny.

470
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:03,049
Speaker 0: And also the recipe was pretty good.

471
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:04,997
Speaker 1: It was mad delicious.

472
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:07,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like what cooking was gonna be a thing.

473
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:08,209
Speaker 1: There was some.

474
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:12,987
Speaker 1: Basically what the story behind the contest is that we get the Blue Apron not promoting them.

475
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:13,550
Speaker 1: They don't pay us.

476
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,201
Speaker 0: We pay them like Emily's cooking a Blue Apron right now.

477
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:17,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't.

478
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:20,870
Speaker 1: actually I'm gonna tell you You probably don't want to become a Blue Apron customer.

479
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:21,310
Speaker 0: It's good.

480
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,255
Speaker 0: If you have I will.

481
00:29:22,457 --> 00:29:24,830
Speaker 0: I have between two and four people in your household.

482
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,814
Speaker 0: It is great.

483
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:27,542
Speaker 0: If you have one it's a little bit.

484
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:27,943
Speaker 1: Okay.

485
00:29:28,204 --> 00:29:29,490
Speaker 1: I mean we can talk about the benefit.

486
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:30,801
Speaker 0: You should do a Thursday show on it.

487
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:31,910
Speaker 0: We should review it, right?

488
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,928
Speaker 1: But the point is you probably don't want to sign up for it.

489
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:38,810
Speaker 1: If you are thinking about it talk to us because we can just give you a free meal and then you can cancel right away.

490
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:41,783
Speaker 1: A free box actually with three meals in it.

491
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:42,789
Speaker 1: then you can cancel right away.

492
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:51,003
Speaker 1: But basically there was a TV show of cooking one of those reality cooking contest shows Which are actually game shows in my opinion not reality shows.

493
00:29:51,385 --> 00:29:56,363
Speaker 1: and the person who won made a recipe very similar to the one that they gave me in the box.

494
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:58,269
Speaker 1: and so I was making that recipe.

495
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:04,141
Speaker 1: and the prize for the contest is Cooking lessons with the person who won the cooking TV show.

496
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:09,525
Speaker 1: and even if it's some lowbrow cooking TV show That person is still probably amazing at fucking cooking.

497
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:13,790
Speaker 1: their meal was delicious And I they definitely know more about cooking than I do and can teach me a lot.

498
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:14,673
Speaker 1: So I wouldn't.

499
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:15,596
Speaker 1: I want that prize.

500
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:23,154
Speaker 1: the prize also includes like six months of free blue apron Which is a fortune of money that shit's expensive Which is why you shouldn't get it.

501
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:27,910
Speaker 1: and also the prize includes a trip to New York, which is completely useless fart noise.

502
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:34,868
Speaker 0: so Whatever I'll be like, all right, you got to fly me round-trip to New York from Seattle.

503
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:38,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, fly me from go to Seattle.

504
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,950
Speaker 1: I want the helicopter ride from LaGuardia to the cooking lesson.

505
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:41,833
Speaker 0: You know what?

506
00:30:41,854 --> 00:30:42,998
Speaker 0: I'll bet you could convince him of that.

507
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,525
Speaker 0: You're like just helicopter me once.

508
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:45,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, just helicopter me.

509
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:46,847
Speaker 1: It's cheaper than the flight, right?

510
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,238
Speaker 1: Only like 500 bucks for the helicopter.

511
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:51,530
Speaker 0: I'll fly to Seattle hang out with like rowing Jeremy.

512
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:56,390
Speaker 0: Then I'll make them fly me to New York and back to Seattle and then I'll hang out with them again.

513
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:02,249
Speaker 0: But then you're still buying a flight to Seattle, yeah, but I basically get to be in Seattle twice, I don't know.

514
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:03,277
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.

515
00:31:03,337 --> 00:31:08,556
Speaker 1: I'm going to be in Paris Back home.

516
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,624
Speaker 1: I'm saving halfway.

517
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:15,566
Speaker 1: I'm a Buy me a round-trip ticket and I'll find some Parisian person who can then go back home for free.

518
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:20,470
Speaker 0: No But yeah, this was legit entertaining and stay tuned for all that.

519
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:25,090
Speaker 0: Also, I've mentioned this on the Patriot a bunch, but I guess I haven't mentioned like in the main part of the show.

520
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:27,681
Speaker 0: Yes, the you tennis show is continuing.

521
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:29,630
Speaker 0: In fact, I've actually we've never stopped it.

522
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:41,006
Speaker 0: we just don't have a set schedule for making it and and when I got the new computer one of the things that I vowed to do was make a pipeline for it because You might have noticed I'm cranking out those geek nights board game videos, right?

523
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:41,770
Speaker 1: Those are much easier.

524
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:42,408
Speaker 1: They don't have video.

525
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:44,716
Speaker 0: but also I took a lot of time.

526
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:52,930
Speaker 0: the first three of those took a ton of time to make because most of my effort was making A pipeline so that now I have a process I can follow that just cranks the videos out.

527
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:55,309
Speaker 0: I'm doing the same thing for the you tennis show.

528
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:59,244
Speaker 0: It just took a while because that's a very complex show to make so stay tuned.

529
00:31:59,264 --> 00:32:02,652
Speaker 0: The you tennis show is coming back Relatively soon.

530
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:03,895
Speaker 0: We'll be recording the next episode.

531
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:09,310
Speaker 0: So this is actually a Monday show that is relevant to both of our careers.

532
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,744
Speaker 1: I think we may have talked about this before but it's impossible to search for.

533
00:32:12,804 --> 00:32:16,358
Speaker 1: and if we did talk about it before it was probably in 2005 over like 12 years ago or

534
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:26,022
Speaker 0: We've probably talked about this concept because it looks like a lot of people in the chat for the live stream thought That we were gonna be talking about building computer versus buying computer.

535
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:27,868
Speaker 0: That's now what we're talking about at all.

536
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:29,715
Speaker 0: We're talking about the general case.

537
00:32:29,755 --> 00:32:37,240
Speaker 0: So the idea is you are a person or a company You're an entity of some kind and you're making something.

538
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:44,070
Speaker 1: Yep, usually software, but not necessarily software, but Regardless of whether you're making software you need soft.

539
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:45,793
Speaker 1: Yes maybe Maybe you're.

540
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:51,130
Speaker 1: you could be a dentist and you need like a database to store all your x-rays and patient data.

541
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:57,490
Speaker 1: Or maybe you're a software company and you're gonna make a search engine, but you also need analytics stuff.

542
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:04,177
Speaker 0: You're a podcaster and you're making videos and you need something to manage the copyright of all the assets You're using in the thing.

543
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:05,947
Speaker 1: You need something to edit videos with.

544
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:12,990
Speaker 1: yeah All right, this software that whatever your business is whether it's a personal business or a real business you need software.

545
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,016
Speaker 1: You also need hardware, but whatever.

546
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:19,990
Speaker 1: but you know, should you buy a software with money?

547
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:23,522
Speaker 1: That already does what you do, which is the effect?

548
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:25,690
Speaker 1: or pay zero for an open source that already does.

549
00:33:26,232 --> 00:33:27,478
Speaker 0: I was actually gonna break that into.

550
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:32,320
Speaker 0: well, it's billed by Cobble together from open source, right?

551
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,075
Speaker 1: But even by me cobbling, you know, it doesn't Acquiring right?

552
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:38,730
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter whether it's zero dollars or a million dollars, right?

553
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:46,762
Speaker 1: I think you take an already existing software and use it even though it might not exactly match what you need But it gets it done.

554
00:33:46,823 --> 00:33:55,030
Speaker 1: hopefully Should you make a software that is exactly what you need rather than using something else?

555
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,662
Speaker 1: Yep, so a lot of times this decision is obvious, right?

556
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:02,289
Speaker 1: If you're an artist, you don't make a Photoshop You just buy fucking Photoshop.

557
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:08,889
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz to make Photoshop would obviously be so time-consuming so expensive and never as good as the original deal.

558
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:19,663
Speaker 0: Well also we know that if you try to cobble together from open source or if you build it yourself without all the expertise and Institutional domain knowledge that Adobe has at best.

559
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:20,467
Speaker 0: You're gonna make the gimp.

560
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:23,484
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Sure, but I mean and there are other obvious situations, right?

561
00:34:23,504 --> 00:34:24,429
Speaker 1: You're making a website.

562
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:27,829
Speaker 1: Should you a website even if you're coding the website itself?

563
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:29,675
Speaker 1: You need a database.

564
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,261
Speaker 1: You're gonna use MySQL or Postgres.

565
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:33,088
Speaker 1: You are not going to make a database.

566
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:34,014
Speaker 1: Yep It's not.

567
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:38,559
Speaker 1: it's obvious at situations but non obvious situations.

568
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,050
Speaker 1: should you make a website by coding or Should you just install WordPress?

569
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:49,164
Speaker 1: That's not necessarily that obvious because coding up a website isn't that did?

570
00:34:49,184 --> 00:34:51,150
Speaker 1: you can do it and you do better than web?

571
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,949
Speaker 1: Press depending on your WordPress based on your website, maybe and then there's also in this middle area.

572
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,556
Speaker 0: So you're gonna make your own website.

573
00:34:57,576 --> 00:34:59,383
Speaker 0: Let's say so you decide that's what you want to do.

574
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:00,729
Speaker 0: Do you?

575
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,994
Speaker 0: Code it up from scratch.

576
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:05,403
Speaker 0: Do you use a minimal framework?

577
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:07,350
Speaker 0: Do you use a full-on framework?

578
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:15,903
Speaker 0: There's a lot of degrees of build-it-yourself from literally writing assembly right all the way up to Download Django and then start throwing some stuff at it.

579
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:16,990
Speaker 1: You're gonna make a video game.

580
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,974
Speaker 1: Do you make an engine?

581
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:22,190
Speaker 1: or to use Unreal Engine or unity or like we talked about just before audio middleware?

582
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:29,455
Speaker 0: And this is the problem where a lot of people who are making the build versus buy decision don't actually know What already exists.

583
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:30,518
Speaker 0: there's a lot of.

584
00:35:30,538 --> 00:35:32,304
Speaker 1: sometimes it's hard to find what already exists.

585
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:35,863
Speaker 1: you google around and you can't find anything But then it actually did exist.

586
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:36,649
Speaker 1: You just couldn't find it.

587
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:42,410
Speaker 0: I only learned that audio middleware was a mature market where you could just get middleware to do this stuff.

588
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:55,550
Speaker 0: less than five years ago at a pecs dev when someone on a panel was like blah blah blah blah blah wasted all this time trying to code this audio shit and then we use this middleware instead and I looked At that middleware and I was like, oh shit

589
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:56,632
Speaker 1: Yes Someone did it

590
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:57,335
Speaker 0: like.

591
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,078
Speaker 0: you might not know.

592
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:06,733
Speaker 1: even if you're in an industry and even if you search and do your research It's hard to find some of these things that are out there and then there's kind of this you might be searching for the a lot Of times.

593
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:08,290
Speaker 1: it's you don't know the word for the thing.

594
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,201
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I need an audio system for my games.

595
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:13,470
Speaker 1: you type typing into Google a game audio system.

596
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:15,838
Speaker 1: You never type in audio middleware so you don't find it.

597
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,102
Speaker 0: Oh, so even worse.

598
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:19,290
Speaker 0: This is someone from my real from my day job.

599
00:36:19,771 --> 00:36:30,330
Speaker 0: so But one of the products that my real company makes is something called a fix engine Which is basically there's the fix protocol for finance shit and we make some software that is like the middleware to manage that.

600
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:33,682
Speaker 0: So like it connects to all these fixed protocol sessions.

601
00:36:33,743 --> 00:36:34,726
Speaker 1: Are you the first search as well?

602
00:36:34,747 --> 00:36:35,509
Speaker 1: You'd be searching fix it.

603
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,254
Speaker 0: No, this is actually.

604
00:36:37,274 --> 00:36:37,896
Speaker 0: that's a point of.

605
00:36:38,598 --> 00:36:43,210
Speaker 0: that's a point of contention and I haven't asked repeatedly to make us higher.

606
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,930
Speaker 0: There's nothing you can do about that or on the first page but sure anyway.

607
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:54,990
Speaker 0: the problem is if You don't already have enough inside baseball to know that that industry calls that thing a fix engine.

608
00:36:55,533 --> 00:37:01,221
Speaker 0: Like if you didn't work in finance and you look up the fixed protocol, you'd be like, alright I guess I need some middleware that speaks fix.

609
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:06,504
Speaker 0: and if you start typing to fix middleware You're gonna mostly find results on how to fix problems with other people's middleware.

610
00:37:06,545 --> 00:37:07,127
Speaker 1: Also the word.

611
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,390
Speaker 1: Yeah the word fix Yeah, not the fixed protocol.

612
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:20,946
Speaker 0: so if you search for a fix engine you're gonna see all this stuff about fixed engines, but you also find all this shit about fixing car engines and Trouble and you're gonna find all these vendors and it might not be clear.

613
00:37:20,986 --> 00:37:31,830
Speaker 0: if there's open source stuff And you don't really know where to look and also most of the kinds of things that you buy as opposed to build Especially if it's enterprise or if it's corporate or anything like that.

614
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:37,629
Speaker 0: There might not be any way to evaluate which one is better than another one, right?

615
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,610
Speaker 1: So let's not so buying right?

616
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:41,903
Speaker 1: so the reasons you would buy something is.

617
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:48,906
Speaker 1: we already talked about a. It's so complicated to make that you could never make it and it just distracts you from doing the thing You actually want to do, right?

618
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,070
Speaker 1: You would never get around to doing the thing you wanted because you're too busy building.

619
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:55,605
Speaker 1: You can't make draw the picture you want it because you're busy making Photoshop.

620
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:56,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get that right.

621
00:37:58,172 --> 00:38:07,190
Speaker 1: B you would buy something Because just you know the time savings right even if it doesn't do exactly what you want, you know, you could do better.

622
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,174
Speaker 1: It's not that good.

623
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:09,077
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just.

624
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:12,250
Speaker 1: it's still mostly done and gets you far along.

625
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:17,476
Speaker 0: You see like case in point time to market if you make it a new website Like you start a tiny game studio.

626
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:21,070
Speaker 0: You need a website the most minimum the quickest time to market every website.

627
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,895
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna like square some squares face Be like click a button.

628
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:26,361
Speaker 0: website appears type stuff in.

629
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:30,550
Speaker 1: it won't be the perfect website, but it's up now Which is better than no website?

630
00:38:30,731 --> 00:38:37,661
Speaker 1: Oh and no website is what you would have if you sat around trying to make one for a month And even then most people who quote-unquote make a website.

631
00:38:37,922 --> 00:38:39,770
Speaker 0: they still use WordPress as the back end.

632
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,659
Speaker 0: They just heavily customize the front end of it.

633
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,790
Speaker 1: Sure, but you still you know, it's still thing you had to do.

634
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,222
Speaker 1: You could also, you know buy as a temporary measure while you build.

635
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:47,704
Speaker 0: Yep,

636
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:48,648
Speaker 1: right things like that

637
00:38:50,331 --> 00:39:12,890
Speaker 0: But yeah, so but the other reasons you'll buy are highly specialized like middleware corporate nonsense mark, you know, I'm thinking mostly like finance or hospitals or Factories where the thing you need Is a thing that other companies that do the same kind of thing need and no one outside of that tiny world will ever need It.

638
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:13,412
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

639
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:16,123
Speaker 0: Unless you think you can make money by selling that thing.

640
00:39:16,163 --> 00:39:18,010
Speaker 0: You definitely do not want to write that thing, right?

641
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:25,585
Speaker 1: so there'll be some sort of thing that's like an industry standard and If you make your own custom thing and don't use it everyone else is using.

642
00:39:25,806 --> 00:39:26,670
Speaker 1: how do you hire people?

643
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,790
Speaker 1: Right people won't know how to use your custom thing.

644
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,324
Speaker 1: It'll sell and people who won't work for you won't be able to go anywhere else.

645
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:37,243
Speaker 1: So it's like oh, yes And all right, let's say you manage to make a Photoshop and it's just as good.

646
00:39:37,263 --> 00:39:42,410
Speaker 1: that's not gonna pretend you did that Right you try to hire artists and they make them use this other thing.

647
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:47,750
Speaker 1: That's not Photoshop because you're not paying for Adobe because you made a thing as good as Photoshop, but it's not Photoshop.

648
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:49,108
Speaker 1: So they have no idea how the hell to use it.

649
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,860
Speaker 1: yep, and anyone who does know how to use it can't use that.

650
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:52,824
Speaker 1: they go somewhere else.

651
00:39:52,844 --> 00:39:54,892
Speaker 1: so they use Photoshop and they don't understand What's going on.

652
00:39:55,214 --> 00:39:57,764
Speaker 1: and you can't share, you know, PSD files with anybody.

653
00:39:57,784 --> 00:39:59,350
Speaker 1: All right, they send you PSD's.

654
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,373
Speaker 1: You're like I can't use these.

655
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:02,439
Speaker 1: we have our special own Scott shop here.

656
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:03,422
Speaker 1: Yeah.

657
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,725
Speaker 1: Here's some SSD files.

658
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:06,250
Speaker 1: Just Scott shop documents.

659
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:14,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know I ran into someone who was using God, you know, I use InDesign for like all Printed design that I ever do.

660
00:40:14,365 --> 00:40:14,728
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

661
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:22,944
Speaker 0: And occasionally I get files that are not from InDesign that are from something else, but you can probably open them Usually not because it's old crap.

662
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:23,689
Speaker 1: What the hell are they from?

663
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:25,955
Speaker 0: Old crap.

664
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:26,457
Speaker 1: Yeah.

665
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but it's like there's some industry standard.

666
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:32,550
Speaker 1: But even if you don't have that there are other reasons you want to use industry standards, right?

667
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,990
Speaker 1: Maybe you know, you got a fix engine there, right?

668
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,081
Speaker 1: Well, maybe you roll your own fix engine and you know the fix protocol.

669
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:40,210
Speaker 1: there is a pretty well documented protocol.

670
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,278
Speaker 0: You can follow it, but it's a super.

671
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:43,542
Speaker 0: there's hundreds of pages of.

672
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:45,630
Speaker 0: here's how I should behave in all these situations.

673
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:46,254
Speaker 0: So what?

674
00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:48,950
Speaker 0: if so, you might not it's not it would be difficult.

675
00:40:49,890 --> 00:41:00,649
Speaker 0: there's a. there's a lot of fiddly stuff that all the existing fixed engines just kind of do around like how to resend messages in particular race conditions and they all Kind of behave the same way.

676
00:41:00,994 --> 00:41:06,710
Speaker 0: But if you just read the spec It might not necessarily be clear because they're not doing it that way based on the spec.

677
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,370
Speaker 0: They're doing it that way because they all already do it.

678
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:09,895
Speaker 1: But that's also like.

679
00:41:09,936 --> 00:41:10,678
Speaker 1: that's pretty good.

680
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:18,990
Speaker 1: as far as like there's a lot of things out there where it's like if you don't use The industry standard thing you can't talk to any other computers that are using the industry standard thing.

681
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:25,083
Speaker 0: Right, especially with binary protocols Anything that uses binary streaming protocols.

682
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:32,930
Speaker 0: you would better be 100% in lockstep with that spec or you are F right like you need your computer to talk to someone else's computer.

683
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,384
Speaker 1: You know You better use the same software they're using and it is guaranteed that it works.

684
00:41:37,424 --> 00:41:40,058
Speaker 1: if you try to make something Yeah might not you?

685
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,947
Speaker 1: it's gonna take you a Ridiculous amount of effort to make your computer talk to a different piece of software and have it work properly.

686
00:41:46,068 --> 00:42:01,910
Speaker 0: Yeah So in terms of building I feel like there are only two reasons you should ever build your own tool Partly because we're in a world right now where there are programmers There are programmers who also know something else and there are people who only know something else.

687
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:07,587
Speaker 0: We're not at that future where everyone's a programmer even though we probably need to be just the way society is going.

688
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:12,805
Speaker 0: No, so Not every company is going to have programmers if you don't have programmers.

689
00:42:12,845 --> 00:42:13,789
Speaker 0: Don't try to build shit.

690
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:16,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean what you got to start hiring them, right?

691
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:23,390
Speaker 0: Yes, but you have to hire them and keep so Hire programmers to build you something custom and then walk away, right?

692
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:29,368
Speaker 1: So that is like the worst case scenario because now you have a piece of software that someone made that person's not gonna help you or talk to you anymore.

693
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:32,873
Speaker 1: and now That you don't have anyone who knows what's going on That's bad.

694
00:42:33,014 --> 00:42:37,750
Speaker 1: But if you would say bought something if you'd bought Photoshop and the person leaves who knows how to Photoshop?

695
00:42:37,832 --> 00:42:38,607
Speaker 1: You can get someone else.

696
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:43,587
Speaker 0: Yep Or if the software stops working because you bought some software you call whoever made this offer and be like yo dog.

697
00:42:43,748 --> 00:42:49,570
Speaker 1: you build a Thing when there is really nothing out there that comes close enough to what you need.

698
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,296
Speaker 1: That's affordable.

699
00:42:51,317 --> 00:42:52,341
Speaker 1: or you build the thing.

700
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,826
Speaker 1: That is your business.

701
00:42:54,007 --> 00:43:01,155
Speaker 1: Yep, right Even if there are competitors to you if the thing is your business Well, that's the business you're in.

702
00:43:01,175 --> 00:43:02,280
Speaker 1: you're competing with those things.

703
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,365
Speaker 1: Don't buy one from them.

704
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:04,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna beat them.

705
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,814
Speaker 1: You're gonna do something better right?

706
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:11,350
Speaker 1: if you're make if your company makes an office suite, you don't buy Microsoft Office.

707
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,630
Speaker 1: You can hear how you use the the opposite you're making because you're gonna beat Microsoft Office.

708
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:27,815
Speaker 1: But you know if you just need an office suite in order to do your business, which is making something That's not an office suite Don't waste your time building why it's a Microsoft Office because you still need fucking Excel to do spreadsheets Corollary there around.

709
00:43:28,478 --> 00:43:35,508
Speaker 0: if if the majority of what you're doing is Custom to you, then you definitely need to build it.

710
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:48,067
Speaker 0: If you need super specialized custom stuff because you have some secret sauce like it's your business model You should probably build it because if you can buy that thing Your business model is not as special as you might have thought it was.

711
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:48,570
Speaker 1: that's right.

712
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:58,230
Speaker 1: There are other times even though the software you might not be in the software business But you still might need to build something to get it done right if your business is unique enough.

713
00:43:58,411 --> 00:44:04,236
Speaker 1: So for example, if you were a professional sport, right, you know Do you need a scorekeeping app?

714
00:44:04,357 --> 00:44:05,321
Speaker 1: right things like this?

715
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:07,510
Speaker 1: that right but that's custom to your sport.

716
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:14,715
Speaker 1: So if you make up invent a new sport out of nowhere, and it's actually people are into it say, you know There's a lot of small sports.

717
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:17,830
Speaker 1: Imagine like when they started the arena football league.

718
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,253
Speaker 1: That was.

719
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:20,970
Speaker 1: that wasn't that long ago and it's not that popular, right?

720
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:27,100
Speaker 1: You know, there was no software for like keeping score of arena Roller.

721
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,850
Speaker 0: derby is way different from a lot of sports.

722
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:30,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's been around a while.

723
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:32,745
Speaker 1: other rules actually changed but the point is right.

724
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:35,353
Speaker 1: they had to you know Their business was roller derby.

725
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:43,407
Speaker 1: their business wasn't software, but there was probably I imagine no existing Roller derby score keeping software that existed, right?

726
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:50,589
Speaker 1: So they either didn't have any or maybe they don't have any or someone made some right because you couldn't buy any.

727
00:44:50,629 --> 00:44:51,271
Speaker 1: there was Nanda.

728
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:55,401
Speaker 0: by now there is a weird Twilight area of build and buy.

729
00:44:55,421 --> 00:45:01,919
Speaker 0: this mostly only exists if you fuck up Because it hit like remedy BMC.

730
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:11,350
Speaker 0: rent like that kind of software the kind of software where you buy a big old Application from some enterprise company and it lets you configure everything inside of itself.

731
00:45:11,651 --> 00:45:14,060
Speaker 1: Well, there are also things that like have plugins, right?

732
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:32,290
Speaker 1: You might buy some sort of like AutoCAD But then it's like oh but we're you know The architectural plugins don't help us because we're not architects and the machining stuff plugins don't help us because we're not making machines Right, we make weird stuff, but we still need AutoCAD because it's too like, you know doing industrial manufacturing.

733
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:37,570
Speaker 1: But the things the things we make there's no existing tool set and AutoCAD for helping us draw them better.

734
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,097
Speaker 0: I think you're gonna contract the plug.

735
00:45:39,118 --> 00:45:45,750
Speaker 1: Oh, well, they're gonna make a plug-in or we're gonna you know We're gonna build, you know an add-on thingy the plug-in model.

736
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:54,770
Speaker 0: It seems to be the best bang for your buck or the best way to go because it basically means you're using Standard platforms and tools to be like the scaffold of whatever it is you're doing.

737
00:45:55,392 --> 00:46:00,406
Speaker 0: But then the parts that are that make you special you're making yourself because that's the whole like.

738
00:46:00,446 --> 00:46:01,610
Speaker 0: that's what makes you special.

739
00:46:02,112 --> 00:46:06,250
Speaker 0: So like if you use WordPress to run your website cuz like everybody uses WordPress, it's fine, right?

740
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:10,450
Speaker 1: If you're doing e-commerce like everyone does e-commerce you can find e-commerce stuff.

741
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:14,630
Speaker 1: But there's something special about your website something that no one else is doing.

742
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:17,970
Speaker 1: It's a. it's a VR podcast, right?

743
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:18,591
Speaker 1: And you need us.

744
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:21,942
Speaker 1: you need some special this thing to distribute it right.

745
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:32,195
Speaker 0: a word press doesn't exist because you're the only VR podcast In town, yeah write a plug-in for WordPress that sits in your WordPress like right in alongside all your other stuff and it connects to the API of Whatever your like backend.

746
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:33,502
Speaker 0: magic is so like.

747
00:46:33,643 --> 00:46:34,447
Speaker 1: we actually like.

748
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:42,378
Speaker 1: so geek nights We started off with WordPress and then I made something and sometimes I regret I'm like I wish we just still had WordPress now.

749
00:46:42,478 --> 00:46:47,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, but sometimes I'm like, no if we went back to WordPress Nothing is exactly what we do.

750
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:49,262
Speaker 1: Yeah geek nights.

751
00:46:49,362 --> 00:46:55,209
Speaker 0: It wouldn't work like nothing on this page is perfect But it is exactly what we wanted it to be when we made this.

752
00:46:55,712 --> 00:47:05,730
Speaker 1: And the only reason it would be just fine if I actually worked on it and updated it cuz I don't have anyone to work On it and update it for me You know, but yeah, it's like cuz we do weird stuff, right?

753
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,190
Speaker 1: We have like different shows like really that's the thing.

754
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:08,955
Speaker 1: It's like there were plenty.

755
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:12,409
Speaker 1: if we were just doing a normal podcast with episodes It would have been just fine.

756
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:22,310
Speaker 1: But because we needed a thing we're like we had the four feeds of Monday Tuesday Wednesday Website had to generate the RSS and all the other pieces, right?

757
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:36,046
Speaker 1: It's like I could have written a bunch of WordPress plugins But it's actually easier to just write a new website than to write WordPress plugins cuz they suck and it's just easier to write HTML from scratch than write WordPress templates because they suck now.

758
00:47:36,107 --> 00:47:40,422
Speaker 0: also part of that Is that when we started podcasting there were not many podcasts

759
00:47:40,462 --> 00:47:55,486
Speaker 1: and I was adding I had to add in all these features like auto Tweet and video and different behaviors to different ones and the plug-in like this plugins for WordPress to auto tweet But they didn't do everything exactly right the way we wanted, you know, and there was.

760
00:47:55,526 --> 00:47:58,496
Speaker 1: no they had configuration options but they didn't have the configurations.

761
00:47:58,536 --> 00:48:05,350
Speaker 1: obviously we needed and something we've been doing for 10 years and I have I'm already a programmer so we had a programmer already.

762
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's really the half of the way.

763
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,013
Speaker 0: reason geek nights has done as well as it has is because we were both already Technologists.

764
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:13,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could do both.

765
00:48:13,378 --> 00:48:15,185
Speaker 1: and we if neither of us are programmers.

766
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,470
Speaker 1: We should not have made a website.

767
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:21,650
Speaker 0: We should have used the WordPress forever But like back then there weren't services to buy.

768
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:33,970
Speaker 1: That's also true is when we started like if we had started now I could probably find something that would do it Geek nights directly in the lips in shit maybe but when we started that stuff did not exist.

769
00:48:34,352 --> 00:48:36,344
Speaker 0: So we have to read like we still do this.

770
00:48:36,364 --> 00:48:50,963
Speaker 0: they have to like Upload manually through the website like it sends our fee audio to the back end of lips in it We don't use any of their front-end stuff and then we like publish back out to our own website ourselves Which that might not be ideal but they get.

771
00:48:50,983 --> 00:48:51,869
Speaker 0: that's the you know.

772
00:48:52,050 --> 00:49:01,784
Speaker 0: The the problem with build is that then you have to maintain and if the thing you build is Not the primary thing you're doing because the primary thing we're doing is just making this happen.

773
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:12,509
Speaker 0: The website just lets you see this Then you will probably not continue to keep all that stuff you built on The leading edge of what other people will eventually do.

774
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:25,010
Speaker 0: So now other people have caught up and surpassed what we built but yet we have a lot of invested Momentum in the thing we built to where moving would be a bigger pain in the ass than keeping the status quo.

775
00:49:26,455 --> 00:49:27,991
Speaker 0: We're not gonna hire a programmer Mm-hmm.

776
00:49:29,074 --> 00:49:33,466
Speaker 1: So yeah, you know the next time you sit down you're about to code something.

777
00:49:33,907 --> 00:49:34,810
Speaker 1: think real hard.

778
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,008
Speaker 1: It's something you could just buy.

779
00:49:38,074 --> 00:49:43,587
Speaker 1: Also when you go shopping for software think real hard, you know, should I just make this?

780
00:49:43,928 --> 00:49:47,610
Speaker 1: and there's a lot of people You know that we linked like not invented here.

781
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:53,110
Speaker 1: There's a lot of companies especially software companies that have this not invented here syndrome, right?

782
00:49:53,511 --> 00:49:57,061
Speaker 1: Where basically, you know anything that wasn't made by them.

783
00:49:57,081 --> 00:50:00,430
Speaker 1: It's like no we got to make it, you know weird software people.

784
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,839
Speaker 1: Why should we buy any software?

785
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:06,150
Speaker 1: Look I was like it can be really bad If you're a place like Google or Microsoft or on Wall Street.

786
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:11,349
Speaker 0: This is the worst because every Wall Street firm has a giant army of developers because like that's how the business is.

787
00:50:11,871 --> 00:50:13,977
Speaker 0: So they always think we can build literally everything in-house.

788
00:50:14,138 --> 00:50:18,210
Speaker 0: I've seen people build like entire content management systems internally.

789
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:22,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you're especially if you're a Google or Microsoft or Facebook this kind of place.

790
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:26,103
Speaker 1: You know if I can, you know buy anything you just make everything.

791
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:27,890
Speaker 1: It's like why should we buy some, you know?

792
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,757
Speaker 1: They don't like wait, there's a there's.

793
00:50:29,778 --> 00:50:32,570
Speaker 1: sometimes you might buy another company and buy.

794
00:50:33,132 --> 00:50:37,870
Speaker 0: You can buy the company that makes the thing you want and force that right customize.

795
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:43,425
Speaker 1: It's like it's like Yahoo bought flicker, but Google made Google Photos, right?

796
00:50:43,465 --> 00:50:44,227
Speaker 1: I think it actually was.

797
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:45,330
Speaker 1: no it was Picasa first.

798
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:46,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, they bought it too.

799
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:48,350
Speaker 0: Did they buy that or did they make Picasa?

800
00:50:48,932 --> 00:50:51,278
Speaker 1: Facebook made their photo thing on their own right?

801
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:52,361
Speaker 0: I lose track.

802
00:50:52,902 --> 00:50:55,930
Speaker 1: The point is, you know, they don't they're not they don't consider.

803
00:50:56,512 --> 00:51:00,569
Speaker 1: You never see a situation where Google just like he's paying some other company.

804
00:51:00,851 --> 00:51:01,514
Speaker 1: They either Google.

805
00:51:01,554 --> 00:51:05,230
Speaker 0: in June in 2004 Google acquired Picasa from a life scape, right?

806
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:05,550
Speaker 1: You.

807
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:07,819
Speaker 1: they either buy the company or make it themselves.

808
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:08,101
Speaker 1: They don't.

809
00:51:08,141 --> 00:51:10,490
Speaker 1: they're not a customer of anyone else for software.

810
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,313
Speaker 1: They don't do that.

811
00:51:11,854 --> 00:51:13,179
Speaker 1: I'm sure they do it somewhere.

812
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:26,630
Speaker 0: someone will find an example, but they don't do it often, but I guess Only build software or anything really if You have the expertise to do so and the thing you're building is the important thing anything that isn't the important thing.

813
00:51:27,071 --> 00:51:34,832
Speaker 0: Someone else probably did it better and you'll either cobble something together from open source stuff or just pay Adobe to use stupid Audition.

814
00:51:34,873 --> 00:51:38,506
Speaker 1: the main thing you have to get over is that when you buy something it won't.

815
00:51:38,526 --> 00:51:41,516
Speaker 1: it will never be perfect even if you're the smallest kind of job.

816
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:47,121
Speaker 1: if you're just making like a blog for one person and you use WordPress and Like that's what WordPress does.

817
00:51:47,181 --> 00:51:48,349
Speaker 1: it shouldn't be perfect, right?

818
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:49,153
Speaker 1: It'll be.

819
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:51,710
Speaker 1: they'll be like one or two things that like niggle you like.

820
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:52,878
Speaker 0: Oh, I want to customize this.

821
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,478
Speaker 0: the one thing that you can't customize I want to come even for.

822
00:51:55,518 --> 00:52:01,570
Speaker 1: like your most basic blog You're gonna have that one thing like for your restaurant or your whatever you're blogging about.

823
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:06,130
Speaker 1: That's like this is slightly wrong and you try to fix it and you just can't get it a hundred percent, right?

824
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:07,355
Speaker 1: It'll be 99% right.

825
00:52:07,937 --> 00:52:09,002
Speaker 1: That's not a reason to go.

826
00:52:09,062 --> 00:52:10,970
Speaker 1: make your own blog just to fix the one thing.

827
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:13,136
Speaker 1: If that one just you got to suffer with it.

828
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:20,970
Speaker 0: if that 1% thing matters that much then you probably grossly Misunderstand what it is that you're actually doing.

829
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:26,588
Speaker 1: Yeah But that's a lot of times you'll see people build something because it's not the thing they buy isn't 100% perfect.

830
00:52:27,371 --> 00:52:34,550
Speaker 0: And then they build something that's not even close to 100% Because they forget about all the boring crap like people vote like especially with web stuff.

831
00:52:34,891 --> 00:52:39,109
Speaker 0: People forget about how to actually make like secure user logins if you try to roll to your own.

832
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:41,281
Speaker 0: That's not a trivial problem.

833
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:41,803
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't do that.

834
00:52:41,823 --> 00:52:42,728
Speaker 0: Like you think you know SSL?

835
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:45,997
Speaker 0: You don't actually really know SSL.

836
00:52:46,017 --> 00:52:47,040
Speaker 0: No, there's this.

837
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,687
Speaker 1: encryption is definitely a thing that you should never make yourself.

838
00:52:49,828 --> 00:52:52,416
Speaker 0: ever ever Nope, never never never never never.

839
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:54,464
Speaker 1: do not make anything that has to do with encryption.

840
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,250
Speaker 1: Just use someone else's good stuff.

841
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,002
Speaker 0: That's the thing you're trying to do with.

842
00:52:58,062 --> 00:52:59,150
Speaker 0: encryption doesn't exist.

843
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,842
Speaker 0: You are probably already making a terrible mistake.

844
00:53:02,464 --> 00:53:04,931
Speaker 1: or if you're not a cryptographer Don't do it.

845
00:53:10,657 --> 00:53:13,200
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
