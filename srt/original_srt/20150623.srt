1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,920
Speaker 0: So this is actually a very special episode of Geek Nights.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:15,780
Speaker 0: So we talked about it on Thursday, but suffice it to say, the episode got messed up due to a crazy timing issue between the sound card and the wazapi drivers and whatever.

3
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:17,740
Speaker 0: So super corrupted audio.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,980
Speaker 0: This was very close to being a lost episode of Geek Nights.

5
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:39,979
Speaker 0: In the 10 years and 1100 or so episodes we've done, we've lost maybe four or five episodes total, but if any of you do entertainment, let me tell you, it is really, really fucking hard to redo an hour of banter that you've just done on the same topic.

6
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:56,660
Speaker 0: However, thanks to Tracy for doing a wonderful job of helping me write a script that would remove the null samples from the messed up corrupted audio, and then following up an audition with a bunch of filters, I was able to un-lose this episode.

7
00:00:57,502 --> 00:01:08,839
Speaker 0: The quality is not the typical Geek Nights quality, so if you listen to the following episode, and it does not sound as silky smooth as I do right now, this is the only episode of Geek Nights that will ever sound like this.

8
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,160
Speaker 0: We have since put in place measures to make sure that this sort of thing can never happen again.

9
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,980
Speaker 0: So this episode, which was lost forever, has been recovered and you can now listen to it.

10
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:29,260
Speaker 0: This is something that, but for technology and perseverance, would never have been heard by any human in the entire world, except myself and Scott.

11
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:40,399
Speaker 0: So stay tuned for future episodes that will sound good again, and if you think this episode sounds bad, this is as good as it could have been made given the technology we have today.

12
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:56,310
Speaker 0: And without further ado, it's Tuesday, June 23rd, 2015.

13
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,847
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

14
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,250
Speaker 1: - I'm Scott.

15
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,968
Speaker 0: - And this is Geek Nights.

16
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:08,264
Speaker 0: Tonight we're talking about one of the newer Wolfenstein games, 'cause Scott played it, but he didn't seem to remember which one he played, so we'll see what the show's about.

17
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,126
Speaker 1: - Let's do this.

18
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,909
Speaker 0: - 'Cause I tried to play the game that he told me to play, which you say.

19
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,710
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you've tried to play it this morning before work.

20
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,670
Speaker 0: - No, no, no, yesterday, so yesterday, it was Wolfenstein New Orders, the one you said you played.

21
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,622
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

22
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:22,790
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

23
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,027
Speaker 0: So I was like, oh whatever, I'll just, like I bought it 'cause I own every game on Steam, I just don't play them.

24
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:37,829
Speaker 0: So I right clicked on it, like yesterday, and I was like, install, and then it was like can't, and I'm like, oh, and I back up, and then I look, and I'm like, oh right, it's a modern AAA game, it's like 40 gigabytes of shit.

25
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:46,390
Speaker 0: So I put it on my fast SSD that I use for like, the few games I play that matter to me, and just, you know, I figure that game would like, the performance of that drive.

26
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:55,850
Speaker 0: And then I just forgot about it, and then that night, I thought, all right, I'll play this game now for a few hours, and then I'll be good to go, and then I look, and it's 80% installed, and I said, well, I went to bed.

27
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,710
Speaker 1: - Wait, wait, wait 'til the last second.

28
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,810
Speaker 0: - Yep, well, we only decided to do the show like two days ago, so, to be fair.

29
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,490
Speaker 1: - We could've done it on something else, we can still change it right now, and stop recording.

30
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,490
Speaker 0: - We could still change it right now.

31
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,349
Speaker 0: - I don't know, Muzdah?

32
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,870
Speaker 1: - No, I didn't hear you played Muzdah 1.

33
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,413
Speaker 0: - Oh no, I've never played Muzdah 1.

34
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:16,490
Speaker 0: I can talk a lot about Advance Wars.

35
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:16,865
Speaker 1: - Great.

36
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:30,930
Speaker 0: - But yeah, so what I've been working on instead is actually, if you might've noticed, my YouTube channel and Scott's YouTube channel have both been rocking, 'cause Scott's been doing the streaming, and I've been vastly, rapidly working through our massive archive of old footage.

37
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,828
Speaker 0: Which we didn't do anything with.

38
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:49,390
Speaker 0: So, panels from PAX South, Expo Hall from PAX South, that video about race walking from the panel from PAX South, where we should all have a race walking, where there's some super butter race walker in my YouTube comments, getting increasingly angry at my dismissal of her entire world, apparently.

39
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,808
Speaker 0: So, you can follow that in my YouTube comments, because that's the only place this little adventure will exist.

40
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:00,329
Speaker 0: So, I guess in terms of gaming news.

41
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:06,528
Speaker 1: There's only one news that we care about, that is big enough that we should, well, I guess there's all this Nintendo E3 news, but I really don't care.

42
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,710
Speaker 1: Until that shit comes out, it's like, whatever.

43
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:19,329
Speaker 0: - There's a lot of E3 news that I'm interested in, in the sense of that's a game I'll play, but there's nothing I'll say that you're not gonna read on whatever blog aggregator is gonna tell you.

44
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:20,569
Speaker 0: Like, oh, this game came out.

45
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,027
Speaker 0: I don't know any more than you do.

46
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:26,849
Speaker 0: I know everything that people who are at E3 know, and you also know all of that.

47
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:28,330
Speaker 0: I don't have anything new to add.

48
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,428
Speaker 1: - But in the world of board gaming, there is a huge to-do.

49
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,130
Speaker 0: - So, you know, Wil Wheaton's show, TableTop, which, to be honest, is kind of shitty.

50
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,970
Speaker 1: - Well, it's also kind of a big deal, despite being kind of shitty.

51
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:45,910
Speaker 1: The production value is high, and it has semi, you know, the famous nerds, famous among nerds people are on there, promoting TableTop games.

52
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,490
Speaker 0: - And it's a show where they play TableTop games together.

53
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,990
Speaker 0: Like, that's a perfect storm of awesome, right?

54
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,930
Speaker 1: - The target audience is people who aren't super into, who are nerdy, but maybe aren't into super TableTop games as much, right?

55
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,650
Speaker 1: It's not for competitive board gaming.

56
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,547
Speaker 1: It's not for us, right?

57
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:03,828
Speaker 1: It's for people who don't know about TableTop games, or maybe you're only into them a little bit, 'cause they're kind of nerdy.

58
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,170
Speaker 0: - Like, oh, I heard there's a game where you can have, like, skeletons running around.

59
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:27,570
Speaker 1: - Right, you're in the nerd community, you know who these people are, you maybe played Settlers once or twice, and now these people are gonna introduce you to all kinds of good, you know, other games, and, you know, that's not a bad, you know, it's a good thing for that to exist, and for those people to want to promote TableTop games with, like, no relatively little compensation for doing so, simply because they want to promote TableTop gaming as a thing, that's good.

60
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,509
Speaker 0: - Yeah, however, the problem is, which isn't the biggest problem in the world in and of itself, but they pretty much always get the rules wrong.

61
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,389
Speaker 1: - Well, specifically, they got the rules wrong, like, a little bit the first season.

62
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:45,150
Speaker 1: I think in the first season, they were playing games that, like, they knew and loved, so they knew the rules better, - But even then, like, they were still making some mistakes.

63
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:56,530
Speaker 1: - Yes, they were still making mistakes, and season two, which is the one that they kickstarted, which means that people paid for it, they got the rules wrong a lot, and in the Kingdom Builders episode, they got it way wrong, like, big time wrong.

64
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:05,090
Speaker 0: - Now, that could've been the news in and of itself, like, that could've been us doing our typical, like, the grognard, like, ugh, this movie is about hacking, and then it's cool kids skateboarding.

65
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,970
Speaker 1: - I wouldn't have even known about this if it weren't for the Streisand effect of Wil Wheaton coming out and saying something about this.

66
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,568
Speaker 0: - Now, I'm gonna quote Wil Wheaton, I'm gonna paraphrase what he said right now.

67
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:18,290
Speaker 0: I'm actually a dick, and I'm throwing my friend under a bus.

68
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:29,889
Speaker 1: - Right, so, A, he admitted that they fucked up the rules, which is good, he at least said that he's taking responsibility, which is, I guess, correct, you should say that, to, well, whatever, I'm not gonna number this.

69
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:38,089
Speaker 1: He said that, yes, it's a problem that they got the rules wrong, and it's an even bigger problem, because he messed up these episodes that people paid for that were Kickstarted, right?

70
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:56,530
Speaker 1: So, he recognized that that was bad, and that he's gonna fix it if they ever make any more, which is good, but most of the post he made, he was pretty much blaming it on this one producer, and he basically says, yeah, I gave this one producer the job of learning the rules to all the games, and that producer fucked it up, you know, I trusted them, they messed it up.

71
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:03,050
Speaker 1: It's like, whoa, you just said you're taking responsibility, you can't say you take responsibility in the same paragraph that you blame someone else, that's not how that works.

72
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,890
Speaker 1: I can't say, yes, I take full responsibility for Rym totally fucking up and breaking this whole podcast.

73
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:13,489
Speaker 1: (laughing) I mean, you said the word's taking responsibility, but you didn't actually do it.

74
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,409
Speaker 0: - Now, there's definitely a, like, Wheaton's Law is extra--

75
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:31,589
Speaker 1: - It's funny that it's called Wheaton's Law, don't be a dick, because here he is being a dick, and there are many people now who are coming out with their stories of him being a dick, perhaps it should be called Wheaton's Law because he's a dick, and not because you shouldn't be like him, as opposed to you should be like him.

76
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,708
Speaker 0: - I am often a dick, I can tell, like, too often.

77
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,149
Speaker 1: - I'm not claiming to obey Wheaton's Law, but Wheaton's Law isn't Scott's Law, is it?

78
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,535
Speaker 0: - Exactly.

79
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,470
Speaker 1: (laughing) - It isn't Scott's Law.

80
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,190
Speaker 0: - Rym's Law is be a dick a lot of the time.

81
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,170
Speaker 1: - Be a dick to the race-walking person who deserves it.

82
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,310
Speaker 0: - Oh my God, that race-walker is so funny.

83
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,750
Speaker 1: - So anyway, but there's a broader issue here, - There's a lot of issues that you can get out of this post.

84
00:07:51,950 --> 00:08:06,749
Speaker 0: - So let's back up first to the broader issue, because one of the, we don't know if we're doing this lecture at PAX Prime, but we have a new lecture we've been working on called Learning Games, because this problem, pretend this wasn't tabletop, pretend this was a guy and a bunch of his friends played a game, and then they realized they got the rules wrong.

85
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,070
Speaker 1: - Happens all the goddamn time.

86
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,010
Speaker 0: - Oh, it happens to us, and we're pro, like, we're pros at this.

87
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,128
Speaker 1: - We're as pro as you can be.

88
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,108
Speaker 0: - And we've, like, we fucked.

89
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:13,210
Speaker 1: up--.

90
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,270
Speaker 1: - As anyone can expect.

91
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:22,529
Speaker 0: - We fucked up the rules to Amun-Re for over a year, and then we corrected them, we found out, like, a couple months later, we were still fucking 'em up.

92
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,670
Speaker 0: So this happens to everyone, but it's endemic in tabletop gaming, because it's always the same story.

93
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,909
Speaker 0: Nobody wants to learn the rules to a new game.

94
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,910
Speaker 1: - Nobody wants to read the rules, 'cause it sucks.

95
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:35,330
Speaker 1: B, the people who write the rules fuck up at writing them.

96
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,149
Speaker 1: C, people, even if they do read the rules, fuck up at reading them.

97
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,770
Speaker 0: - And then four, nobody questions the rules effectively in the course of learning or playing the game.

98
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:49,750
Speaker 1: - If you learn the rules from someone else, 'cause you're the vast majority of people who doesn't wanna read the rules, you just send someone to teach you the game, right?

99
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:55,188
Speaker 1: He just wants this producer to read the rules and teach it to him.

100
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:06,550
Speaker 1: You can 100% trust that that person is telling you everything correctly, and any mistake they make is now passed on to a whole bunch more people, and then mistakes, specifically in tabletop games, rules mistakes spread like wildfire.

101
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,130
Speaker 0: - So our entire friend group-- -

102
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:20,088
Speaker 1: And one person reads a rule book, and 100 people learn it by word of mouth, because apparently they wanna go back to the Stone Age, where you can only pass stories down verbally through oral tradition, and not through the magic of written

103
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:20,189
Speaker 0: text.

104
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,969
Speaker 0: - If you didn't go for writing, and you went for horses instead, then maybe I could understand that.

105
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,748
Speaker 1: - Well, I mean, yeah.

106
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,450
Speaker 1: - Oral tradition-- - If there's horses in your starting area next to your settler, why would you build writing first?

107
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:33,710
Speaker 1: Are you fucking stupid?

108
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,568
Speaker 1: You can just steal the stone tablets from Gandhi next to you.

109
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:38,008
Speaker 1: He's got 'em.

110
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:41,709
Speaker 1: If you got a horse, his elephant ain't gonna catch up to you.

111
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,250
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but, so, here's an example of that.

112
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,750
Speaker 0: Glory to Rome, kind of a complex game to learn, because it doesn't follow a lot of typical patterns of games.

113
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,228
Speaker 0: - Our entire friend group, except us, found the game, and a few of our friends found it first, taught everyone but us.

114
00:09:59,091 --> 00:09:59,710
Speaker 0: Then we played it.

115
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,483
Speaker 0: We're like, "Oh, this is a pretty good

116
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:00,585
Speaker 0: game.".

117
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:05,189
Speaker 0: And then after we played it once, I bought it, and I immediately took the rules and wrote 'em cover to cover.

118
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,629
Speaker 1: I went back to our friend-- - Something that most people do not do.

119
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,549
Speaker 1: They'll buy a board game and throw the rules out.

120
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,962
Speaker 0: - And then I could probably find the forum post where I told all our friends, "Guys, you've been playing this game 100% wrong.

121
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:13,795
Speaker 0: "What the

122
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:14,063
Speaker 0: fuck?".

123
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,689
Speaker 1: - Yep.

124
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:25,509
Speaker 0: - So, the problem, and this is, we see it in D&D, too, in a different sense, of once someone's the dungeon master, they're the dungeon master forever, but every gaming group in tabletop has the rules, bitch.

125
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:45,170
Speaker 0: The person who actually knows the rules to all the games and ends up having this annoying duty of every game you play ends up being a teaching game where you are 100% responsible, because if I teach a bunch of people at a table at a con a game, and I mess up a rule, I ruin the experience for them, and they're gonna blame me for their bad experience.

126
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,490
Speaker 1: - Right, well, if someone teaches me a game, I always ask for the rule book and start checking what they're saying, right?

127
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,970
Speaker 1: Always, me or Rym, you'll see, whenever anyone teaches our group a game, either me or Rym will have the instruction book.

128
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,730
Speaker 0: - One of us is listening.

129
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,890
Speaker 1: - 'Cause no one else can be trusted.

130
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,990
Speaker 1: - One of us is listening, one of us is reading, and even-- - And even if Rym is doing the reading, I'm basically constantly like, "Hey, Rym, check that.

131
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:03,844
Speaker 1: "Hey, Rym, is this

132
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:04,089
Speaker 1: right?".

133
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,370
Speaker 1: I'm asking him the questions, 'cause he's got the rule book.

134
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,250
Speaker 1: I'm not asking the questions of the person teaching the game.

135
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,423
Speaker 0: - Yep.

136
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,109
Speaker 1: - I'm asking Rym, holding the rule book, "Hey, check on this.

137
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:12,243
Speaker 1: "Hey, what if this

138
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:12,569
Speaker 1: happens?".

139
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,690
Speaker 0: - There is an easy solution, but it involves any way.

140
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,830
Speaker 0: If you care about tabletop games, it's--.

141
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,509
Speaker 1: - Right, so that's the obvious question that comes up.

142
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,730
Speaker 1: It's like, Wil Wheaton and other people on tabletop and all board gamers in general.

143
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:26,310
Speaker 1: If you like board games so much, why don't you like reading the rules?

144
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,250
Speaker 0: - Now, maybe we answered that question before.

145
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:38,989
Speaker 0: Board games today, especially American board games, and especially, especially Kickstarted board games, have the worst written rules.

146
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:48,330
Speaker 1: - Even Netrunner, the game that I play more than any other game, has so many rules-writing problems on the cards, it is like the number one problem with that game.

147
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,870
Speaker 1: It is heinous.

148
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,248
Speaker 1: A guy came, here's a story, right?

149
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,130
Speaker 1: This guy comes to the Netrunner meetup.

150
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,289
Speaker 1: He had been playing Netrunner alone.

151
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,030
Speaker 1: You know, we're with his friend, I guess, right?

152
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,789
Speaker 1: He hadn't really played with people in the public anymore.

153
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,670
Speaker 1: - He hadn't been to tournaments or anything like that.

154
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,970
Speaker 1: You know, he works in New York Public Library.

155
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,828
Speaker 1: He was a totally cool dude.

156
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,470
Speaker 1: He comes to our Netrunner meetup.

157
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,469
Speaker 1: He's like, "Hey, I found your meetup.

158
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,002
Speaker 1: "Wanna play some

159
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:05,270
Speaker 1: Netrunner?".

160
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:06,510
Speaker 1: I'm like, "That is the best thing ever.

161
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,366
Speaker 1: "Come and play Netrunner with

162
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:07,489
Speaker 1: me.".

163
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:08,609
Speaker 1: So I played Netrunner with him.

164
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:15,630
Speaker 1: And then he puts a card on another card, and immediately I see he's trying to do something very clever, very clever indeed.

165
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:19,189
Speaker 1: And if it had worked and was not against the rules, it would have been quite strong.

166
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:34,910
Speaker 1: However, I also immediately recognized, oh crap, that if you read the text on those two cards, the way they interact, any reasonable human being with a grasp of the English language would assume that the thing that he was doing would be a perfectly acceptable and legal play.

167
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:44,590
Speaker 1: But me, because I am engaged in the online community and the competitive community, and I read the FAQ and I read Twitter and I read all these things, knew that the thing that he was about to do was against the rules.

168
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,629
Speaker 1: And I was like, I was basically apologizing to him.

169
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:51,189
Speaker 1: Like, it was like I was the bad guy for in giving him the bad news.

170
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:54,329
Speaker 1: That like, sorry, that doesn't work.

171
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:58,830
Speaker 1: And your entire deck concept doesn't work because you got the rule wrong.

172
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:00,870
Speaker 1: It's the people who make the games fall.

173
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,508
Speaker 1: But imagine if-- - They suck that badly.

174
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:09,349
Speaker 0: - But think about the people who don't read the rule books and talk to other people in these situations where the rule books are not great.

175
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:20,569
Speaker 0: Then, and we run into this often, especially when we play Kickstarted games, where two intelligent humans will read a rule book cover to cover who understand games and disagree about how the game works.

176
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:27,179
Speaker 0: And unless there's a canonical answer, like the game designer says this is the way, the game is fucked.

177
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,310
Speaker 1: - Go back and listen to our ancient review of Hellas.

178
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:31,750
Speaker 0: - Oh my God.

179
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,530
Speaker 1: - The game with the rules that were not answered on BoardGameGeek in a proper fashion.

180
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,990
Speaker 1: So even though we shouldn't, you should never have to go online 'cause apparently like most people don't.

181
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,490
Speaker 1: Like the guy at the Netrunner meetup, he didn't go online to find the rules.

182
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,830
Speaker 1: He only checked the fact after I said something to him and then discovered that I was right.

183
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,670
Speaker 0: - Now it's not like this is impossible, especially like German games that were released, like Puerto Rico, Tigris, New Freighties.

184
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:57,970
Speaker 0: Like there was a bunch of games that came out within a span of time that they basically are written as best you can write rules.

185
00:13:58,251 --> 00:13:59,269
Speaker 0: They should be like an RFC.

186
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:02,070
Speaker 0: Rules should be very explicit and very clear in their language.

187
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,650
Speaker 1: - There should be no ambiguity whatsoever.

188
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,129
Speaker 0: - May not do this, must do this, after doing this.

189
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:15,450
Speaker 1: - And there should be no scenario or combination, there should be no game state which is unexplained or undefined, right?

190
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,968
Speaker 1: Unlike say the C programming language, there are certain undefined states.

191
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,689
Speaker 0: - What does that lead to?

192
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,790
Speaker 1: - For a board game there should be none.

193
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,429
Speaker 0: - That leads to an exception and then a crash?

194
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:23,889
Speaker 0: Like board games can crash.

195
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,010
Speaker 0: Hellas crashed and we had to stop playing.

196
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,928
Speaker 0: Well we did a stack, I used to try to figure out.

197
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,390
Speaker 1: - So there's a lot, there's so much going on in this news, we can make it the only news, right?

198
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,150
Speaker 1: Why do people not want to read rule books?

199
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,430
Speaker 1: Why are people bad at reading rule books?

200
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,289
Speaker 1: Why are they bad at writing them?

201
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,450
Speaker 0: - So if we do that panel of facts.

202
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,390
Speaker 1: - Why is Will Wheaton a dick?

203
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:42,869
Speaker 1: It's like there's so much going on here.

204
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:50,470
Speaker 0: - So another aspect of it is that in terms of people teaching games or wanting to play games, we found this phenomenon a lot, even with a lot of our friends.

205
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,129
Speaker 0: We know people who love board games and will play the fuck out of them.

206
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,768
Speaker 1: - The storm is here.

207
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,670
Speaker 0: - But there's a huge thunderstorm going on.

208
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,550
Speaker 1: - It went from nothing to shh in about a fraction of a minute.

209
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,390
Speaker 0: - So on Sunday, right, me and Emily are out biking.

210
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,189
Speaker 0: We're gonna go to Radagast and have salsa's dinner.

211
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:08,189
Speaker 0: And it's sunny and clear, and then in the distance we see this thin thunderstorm.

212
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,150
Speaker 0: So we're like okay, so we're biking, biking, biking.

213
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:13,809
Speaker 0: And then suddenly Emily says, "Is that a wall of rain fast approaching

214
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:13,910
Speaker 0: us?".

215
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,649
Speaker 0: And sure enough, there is a wall of rain, thick to the point that buildings were disappearing in front of us.

216
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:20,789
Speaker 0: It was like a magic spell coming to our doom.

217
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,190
Speaker 0: It hit us like a brick, it was amazing.

218
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:26,550
Speaker 0: Anyway, so clearly forgot my tan, whatever.

219
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,290
Speaker 0: All right, so people don't like the process of learning games, but some-- - People don't like to learn.

220
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,410
Speaker 1: People try to avoid learning.

221
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,269
Speaker 1: That's why they don't use VIM.

222
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,310
Speaker 1: They don't want to learn something, even though it's better once you learn it.

223
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,870
Speaker 0: - And part of that, I think, is that most people who teach games-- - They're anti-intellectual if you don't like learning.

224
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,350
Speaker 0: - Even if, let's say it's like us.

225
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:46,687
Speaker 1: We learn the games, so we take the time-- - I don't want to bike with gears, then have to learn how to use them.

226
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,279
Speaker 0: - But we learn the games,

227
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,582
Speaker 1: and

228
00:15:48,703 --> 00:16:00,530
Speaker 0: we teach the games, even though I don't necessarily want to be, because I know that if I teach someone, and they learn the game from me, they're gonna play it right, unless it's Amun-Re, and then it'll be good, and I just kind of spread the right, you know, there's a lot of reasons why I do this.

229
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,570
Speaker 0: The same reason your friend who hates DMing is always your dungeon master.

230
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,189
Speaker 1: - 'Cause it'll be a shitty game if you do it.

231
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:12,830
Speaker 0: - But most people teaching board games do a terrible job of it, even if they do know the rules.

232
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:17,570
Speaker 0: So there's a whole separate discussion, even beyond everything, of how do you teach rules?

233
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,550
Speaker 1: - You're bad at teaching, bad at reading, bad at writing, bad at everything having to do with the rules.

234
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:29,910
Speaker 0: - Actually, I was on a panel at PAX last year with, I think, Donna Prior and Luke Crane, everyone were talking about that, and some people, you know, like learning, people learn different ways.

235
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:43,949
Speaker 0: Some people learn better, where you play the game one, say, look, this is a teaching game, we'll just play, I'll explain each rule as it comes up, but then everyone has to understand that, yeah, because you didn't learn the game fully before you played it, your strategy might literally ruin you, and you have to expect the fact that you're gonna lose horribly.

236
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,039
Speaker 0: A lot of people--.

237
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,829
Speaker 1: - Luke Crane should not be talking about writing rules properly, 'cause he'll put the same rule in his book three different places.

238
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,290
Speaker 0: - He's slightly so in every play.

239
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,050
Speaker 1: - Crook's slightly slow each time, worded a slightly different way.

240
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,800
Speaker 1: - The biggest ambiguity

241
00:16:54,901 --> 00:17:14,079
Speaker 0: in his rules that bothers me a lot is, there's a situation in Dwarven Greed that says one thing that leaves an ambiguity, most people interpret that ambiguity one way, then gives an example that gives a categorical number for the thing that was ambiguous, that is the opposite of what most people interpret the rule to be, 'cause they forget about that sentence.

242
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:14,829
Speaker 0: that was an example.

243
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:17,409
Speaker 0: But I digress, I love you, Luke.

244
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,589
Speaker 0: - If you wanna hire me, I'll rewrite Burning Reel, I'll edit Burning Reel's rules.

245
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,730
Speaker 1: - We'll hate it, 'cause we'll put Oxford Commas in.

246
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:31,770
Speaker 0: - I would be willing to leave the Oxford Comma out, however it would double my fee, because there's some suffering that would go on.

247
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,987
Speaker 0: That would be, that's hard, that's a very difficult thing you ask of me.

248
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:43,690
Speaker 0: So outside of all that, tabletop is a great idea for a show, but no one's making it except these guys.

249
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,250
Speaker 1: - Well, production value's very high, and they have famous people.

250
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,388
Speaker 1: - They do.

251
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:54,210
Speaker 1: - I feel like without the famous people, it doesn't work, because then how do you attract in the nerds who aren't into tabletops a whole bunch already?

252
00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:03,023
Speaker 0: - Yep, well the problem is, if you make the show that is more for the tabletop people, who are good at and care about tabletop, those people are already in, so you're not really getting them into more.

253
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,230
Speaker 1: - Right, it's a different audience, that would be, you know.

254
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:09,770
Speaker 0: - That audience is more like, I'm gonna watch a bunch of people be funny, and I'm gonna learn this game.

255
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:20,270
Speaker 1: - Right, the only way to do it without famous people would be to have people who are just really likable characters, either acting or actually likable people, so that people could identify with them and, you know.

256
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,549
Speaker 0: - So why don't we write the show, and we'll get Dave and Joel to play us in the show.

257
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,389
Speaker 1: - Let's not do this.

258
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:46,473
Speaker 0: - But I was thinking about this a lot, and I kinda wanna like, you know, I don't wanna do the whole production value thing, but I feel like we could just do two player games, so Scott and I have enough equipment to fully deck that out with pretty high production values, if it's only two players, and I feel like we should just try to make this show with a slightly different format, 'cause I realized the format that they need to avoid.

259
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:52,999
Speaker 0: this rules problem is one, everyone in the show is gonna have to read all the rules, or have a rules coach or something.

260
00:18:53,020 --> 00:19:00,550
Speaker 1: - Right, so that's the other thing I wanted to talk about, the last thing I wanted to talk about that I didn't, right, where the solutions to this problem, it's like, whoa, okay, so you didn't wanna read the rules.

261
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,049
Speaker 1: First of all, you should read the rules.

262
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:07,490
Speaker 1: Second of all, you had this one producer read the rules for you, the person you threw under the bus.

263
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,570
Speaker 0: - Nobody else at any point.

264
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:14,269
Speaker 1: - It's like, if I'm doing a show, and I'm a big, they're a big fucking deal, right, you know, famous, famous people.

265
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,345
Speaker 1: - Yeah, Wil Wheaton could've asked--.

266
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:36,150
Speaker 1: - You could get the designer of the game to come when you record, you can get a representative from the publisher of the game to come when you record the show, you can go on BoardGameGeek and find a nerd who lives locally, and even if that nerd is not suitable for television, you could have that nerd consult from off-screen, and who's an expert at the game, you have me playing, and I guarantee that rules layer nerd, they will make sure that you get every rule correct, Mr.

267
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:40,830
Speaker 1: Wheaton, no, no, no, you can't roll that dice over there, that's not the time yet.

268
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,570
Speaker 0: - In fact, you make it a shtick, like Pee-wee's Playhouse, where someone's about to make a wrong move, and aah!

269
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,990
Speaker 1: - Well, you don't even need, you can just edit that part out, you don't even need to see the nerd.

270
00:19:48,230 --> 00:20:02,790
Speaker 1: Finally, you could have just somebody watch your episode before you upload it and make it public on YouTube, 'cause it's a, it's not a live show, not live at all, and they could say, hey, you got these rules wrong here, and then you could put notes in the episode, or edit the episode to conceal the parts where you got the rules wrong.

271
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,150
Speaker 0: - Even the notes would be fine, in fact-- - You could tug over it and get the rules right.

272
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,870
Speaker 0: - The format I would use is actually a little more subtle.

273
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:17,229
Speaker 0: I'd have the teaching section that I could upload separately, that's also part of the episode, where it's like, the gaming group that's in the show, learning the game, like being taught it, however that is.

274
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:26,730
Speaker 0: And then the part of the show, or the show, like part two, where they're playing it, maybe someone starts to mess up a rule, and that's part of the interaction, like oh, Scott, you're fucking that up, right there.

275
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:26,970
Speaker 0: - Maybe.

276
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:39,627
Speaker 0: - Or, oh guys, we messed this up, because shows like this also, by plowing through and ignoring rules ambiguities, because when normal gamers play a game, there's always that moment where someone-- - Everyone stops, you gotta check the rules, and we're all sitting around going, eh.

277
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,710
Speaker 0: - Or, you're all playing, and Scott's doing his turn, and then I just say, hey, Pete, can I see the rule book?

278
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:46,570
Speaker 0: And Scott's like, why do you wanna see the rule book?

279
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,509
Speaker 0: I'm like, I just wanna see the rule book.

280
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,610
Speaker 0: I just wanna look at something.

281
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:50,130
Speaker 0: Keep taking your turn, I'm just looking.

282
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:52,530
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no, you can't attack me in Umbria.

283
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,266
Speaker 1: - Ha ha, actually I can't.

284
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:55,808
Speaker 1: You can't stop me.

285
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:04,650
Speaker 0: - But make that part of the show, either script it, like if there's a commonly messed up rule, you script it where Felicia or someone messes up that part of the rule, and then you guys fix it in game.

286
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,348
Speaker 0: There are some games, like Puerto Rico has a rule, where if you fuck up the ship, there's a rule for what to do.

287
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,527
Speaker 0: In Fury of Dracula, if you fuck up Dracula, there's a rule you follow to fix it.

288
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,710
Speaker 0: Like, make that part of the show, 'cause the reality is, rules fuck up.

289
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,690
Speaker 1: - That's what actual tabletop gaming is like when you're playing a game for the first time.

290
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,310
Speaker 0: - Yeah, or even, you know, four years after you start playing a game, even when you're a pro, Amun-Re.

291
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:30,329
Speaker 0: If any of you are playing Amun-Re, let me know, and I'll make sure, 'cause I'll bet you're messing these rules up, too.

292
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,830
Speaker 1: - Yeah, make sure you give the gods the correct sacrifice.

293
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:41,410
Speaker 0: - Yeah, ha ha ha, you don't get goodies from the gods if you also steal from the temple, and the extra farmers can go fucking anywhere.

294
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:43,142
Speaker 0: Anywhere.

295
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,470
Speaker 1: - Even where there isn't a farm, they can go in, what's the place with no farms, Dokla?

296
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:47,889
Speaker 0: - Dokla.

297
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,989
Speaker 1: - They can go to Dokla.

298
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,630
Speaker 0: - Yeah, suddenly Dokla's pretty awesome, if you got three of those things in your hand, bam, bam, bam, yeah, anyway.

299
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:53,889
Speaker 0: Well, one per turn.

300
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,030
Speaker 1: - That's fine.

301
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,650
Speaker 0: - There's a couple other rules that we also, but anyway.

302
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:07,126
Speaker 0: So yeah, people should try to make the show better, maybe, or we'll just, I don't know, this is really easy for you to fix for your show, and--.

303
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,790
Speaker 1: - If you ever make any more.

304
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,803
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but you kinda--.

305
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:17,750
Speaker 1: - Also, I'm surprised to find out their show wasn't publisher game developer sponsored, like they were just picking games they wanted and being funded by Kickstarter money.

306
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:29,430
Speaker 1: Hey, game publishers, send us a copy of your game, and also some money, and I will produce a show playing your game, but my review will be 100% honest, if your game is garbage, I'm gonna say so, so deal with it.

307
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,909
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we'll even do a whole tabletop-y kind of episode thing.

308
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,150
Speaker 1: - If you want me to say your game is amazing, no matter even how garbage it is, - Give us enough to retire.

309
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,309
Speaker 1: - Give me enough money to go to the beach, and not come back.

310
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,089
Speaker 0: - So we're here in Monaco on our eighth week of vacation playing Munchkin now.

311
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,769
Speaker 1: - Why would I be playing Munchkin, watching the Grand Prix from our yacht?

312
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,588
Speaker 0: - Is the Grand Prix of games, I highly recommend it, just like I recommend this caviar as a champagne.

313
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,550
Speaker 1: - Yes, if you see, whoa, Kimi's coming out the tunnel.

314
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:01,868
Speaker 1: What level are you in the Munchkin, I don't know, three, whatever.

315
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:11,888
Speaker 0: - So yeah, there's a lot more to be said, but most of it will involve, hopefully will be us in a panel at either PAX or somewhere else, if we decide to do this one instead of the other one, on sports.

316
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:19,519
Speaker 0: Things of the Day.

317
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:25,080
Speaker 0: This is a YouTube video that, it asks a question where the answer is not obvious.

318
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,400
Speaker 1: - I don't know the answer yet.

319
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:38,760
Speaker 0: - And you might even think, oh duh, but then when you think about it, it doesn't make sense, and then it goes beyond that, so the question is, and it's a Vsauce episode, these guys are good, why do we have two nostrils as opposed to one big one?

320
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:53,414
Speaker 1: - Right, wouldn't there at some point in the history of genetics, there would have been some genetic variation to where some creature had one nostril, and why did that one nostril creature somehow have a disadvantage at life and surviving, compared to the two nostril creatures?

321
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:57,380
Speaker 1: that resulted in every creature that has a nose having two nostrils?

322
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,080
Speaker 0: - Now the guess I had was it's like a screen door to keep bigger things from getting into it, like a big bug.

323
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,019
Speaker 1: - No, that's what the hairs are for.

324
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,540
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but also I get this one line down the middle.

325
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:12,108
Speaker 0: Two, I wondered if it was something around the nose, like if something covers your face and blocks it up, because you got the little ridge that kind of sticks out past the players.

326
00:24:12,128 --> 00:24:14,300
Speaker 1: - Yeah, maybe if it's stuck in one nostril, you can survive with the other one.

327
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,739
Speaker 0: - Yep, but the answer is not what you think.

328
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,959
Speaker 0: And then it answers another question that you probably didn't realize you had until just now.

329
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,359
Speaker 0: You ever notice how sometimes one of your nostrils seems like it's way more open and flowing than the other one?

330
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:25,917
Speaker 0: - Yes.

331
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,360
Speaker 0: - That's all the time.

332
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:36,980
Speaker 0: You always have one primary or fast, and one secondary or slow nostril, and your body shifts stuff to change which one it is at different times during the day.

333
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,420
Speaker 1: - Fucking body, why don't you just keep both of them fast all the time?

334
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,140
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you know what, the answer to that is kind of amazing.

335
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,559
Speaker 1: - I should just get a surgery to make that happen.

336
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,139
Speaker 0: - No, you'd be fucked if that happened.

337
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,451
Speaker 0: - Why?

338
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,620
Speaker 0: - Because you wouldn't be able to smell some things anymore.

339
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:51,039
Speaker 0: The slow nostril smells different things from the fast nostril.

340
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,980
Speaker 0: - What the fuck?

341
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,860
Speaker 0: - This video blew my mind in nine minutes and 22 seconds, so I now know why we have two nostrils.

342
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,760
Speaker 0: - Are you sure this is true?

343
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,080
Speaker 0: - Yes, actually.

344
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,600
Speaker 1: - This YouTube video can be trusted.

345
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,059
Speaker 0: - So right now, my left one's slow and my right one's fast.

346
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,559
Speaker 1: - Same.

347
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:05,980
Speaker 0: - Yep.

348
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:07,820
Speaker 0: This video was amazing.

349
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,000
Speaker 0: Also, Vsauce is amazing, so you should just follow them.

350
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,040
Speaker 1: - All right, so I was gonna use another thing of the day, but there was this better thing of the day, so the other one's gonna wait.

351
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:25,039
Speaker 1: So I'm sure maybe some people have seen this, but I've seen a lot of the old, original Japanese TV commercials for Famicom games that were made back in the day, like the live-action Zelda one and whatnot.

352
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,632
Speaker 1: Apparently, there was a TV commercial for Mother, also known as the original Earthbound, right?

353
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,580
Speaker 1: 'Cause Earthbound was Mother 2 for the SNES.

354
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,860
Speaker 1: This is Earthbound for the NES, or Mother for the NES.

355
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:40,260
Speaker 1: The original TV commercial in Japan.

356
00:25:41,222 --> 00:25:42,400
Speaker 1: Oh my God, this commercial.

357
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,858
Speaker 1: It's short, but holy shit, that's a fucking commercial right there.

358
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,680
Speaker 0: - I know that it is perfectly accurate to the game despite displaying no gameplay footage whatsoever.

359
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,899
Speaker 1: - It's like, any game that had that commercial, how could you not buy?

360
00:25:57,281 --> 00:25:58,299
Speaker 1: How could you not buy?

361
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,400
Speaker 0: - It would be interesting.

362
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:05,918
Speaker 0: 3D model the actors in that, and then make a remake of the game where it just looks like that the whole time.

363
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,158
Speaker 1: - You don't need that.

364
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,740
Speaker 0: - That would be, anyway.

365
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:10,240
Speaker 0: This commercial is pretty amazing.

366
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,555
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

367
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,900
Speaker 0: - In the meantime, the book is the first of all those Wheel of Time books, which I actually, I'm like 12 chapters in now.

368
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,818
Speaker 1: - All right, you're about as far as me.

369
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,879
Speaker 0: - They made it over the river.

370
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,180
Speaker 1: - Oh, okay.

371
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:20,958
Speaker 1: - The big river.

372
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:23,140
Speaker 0: In the ferry, did you get the ferry boat?

373
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:25,358
Speaker 0: Am I already past you?

374
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:25,658
Speaker 1: - Maybe.

375
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,639
Speaker 0: - Did a dragon thing attack them?

376
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,140
Speaker 1: - A dragon thing.

377
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,099
Speaker 1: No, troll dudes.

378
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Speaker 0: - Did they, yeah, which time?

379
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,559
Speaker 1: - They burned the village down.

380
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,639
Speaker 0: - Okay, I'm quite a bit past that.

381
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,520
Speaker 1: - I haven't read it in a while 'cause I've been busy.

382
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,320
Speaker 0: - The village is a distant memory, and they just fucked some--.

383
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,920
Speaker 1: - I'm at the part where they're about to leave the village.

384
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,100
Speaker 0: - Okay, they are long past the village.

385
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,300
Speaker 1: - I figured that's gonna happen.

386
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:48,957
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

387
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:50,999
Speaker 0: You know what?

388
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,920
Speaker 1: - It's a fantasy novel?

389
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,680
Speaker 0: - It's a fantasy novel.

390
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,378
Speaker 1: - Isn't that what I said?

391
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,599
Speaker 0: - It's exactly what you said, and now when I was trying to prod you for more, but I don't know what else I could say.

392
00:26:59,123 --> 00:26:59,860
Speaker 0: It's a fantasy novel.

393
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,499
Speaker 1: - It's a fantasy novel.

394
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,438
Speaker 0: - What I find interesting is that it has the same pace as Dumas in The Count of Monte Cristo.

395
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:25,340
Speaker 0: In that, the action, the writing, the words, things that happen per page is constant, and it never zooms out, it never zooms in, it never speeds up, it never slows down, it never fucking skips anything.

396
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,179
Speaker 1: - That's true.

397
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,138
Speaker 0: - And I'm not saying that's bad.

398
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,164
Speaker 1: - Mr.

399
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:30,080
Speaker 1: Dumas lover over there.

400
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,300
Speaker 0: - Nor am I saying that's good, but this is a fantasy novel.

401
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,700
Speaker 1: - This is a fantasy novel.

402
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,780
Speaker 0: - And it is better than most fantasy novels.

403
00:27:37,384 --> 00:27:38,499
Speaker 0: I will already give it that.

404
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,660
Speaker 1: - Well, you don't get to be ultra famous with being complete garbage.

405
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:41,961
Speaker 1: -

406
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:53,100
Speaker 0: I'm starting to see why some of our friends who were really into these books when they were younger are the way they are today, if this was their formative fantasy book, and why I'm the way I am today, 'cause my formative fantasy after Lord of the Rings Hobbit

407
00:27:53,523 --> 00:27:54,308
Speaker 1: was

408
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:57,957
Speaker 0: pretty much all the like Elphie, Elphie, forgotten

409
00:27:57,997 --> 00:27:58,200
Speaker 1: of Adams.

410
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,460
Speaker 1: - Of all the nerd media someone consumes, the fantasy novels they consume, define them the most?

411
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,496
Speaker 0: - In terms of their fantasy and role-playing tastes, I think.

412
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:12,680
Speaker 0: I'll bet you could predict what classes people play in D&D when they're in their 20s, based on the first 10 fantasy books they read.

413
00:28:14,322 --> 00:28:16,119
Speaker 0: That would be a study I would like to see.

414
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:18,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

415
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:33,717
Speaker 0: Anyway, otherwise, we uploaded a ton of videos of stuff that I'll link to, our bad games panel is up on YouTube, and very, very soon, I will have uploaded, remember we did that walkthrough, like PAX Prime Expo Hall Live as an experiment, and it was pretty good.

416
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,120
Speaker 1: - Yeah, people seem to like it from whatever it is.

417
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:47,500
Speaker 0: - Like we fucked up a bunch of stuff, 'cause we just kinda made it and it was fine, so this is our second attempt from PAX South, because that's how far behind I am in video, but it's not twice as good as that old one, so continuous improvement.

418
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,454
Speaker 0: Scott's got video of the Netrunner Championships he was just at.

419
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,458
Speaker 1: - Yep.

420
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,280
Speaker 0: - And otherwise, we're gonna be at Kineticon in a few weeks, in Hartford, Connecticut.

421
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,319
Speaker 1: - Very soon.

422
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:07,140
Speaker 1: - And like we've said-- - If you are a nerdy person of any kind, which you are, 'cause you're listening to this, if you are within driving distance of Hartford, Connecticut, you should be at Kineticon.

423
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,420
Speaker 1: If you're farther away, maybe not worth it unless you're really rich and got nothing better to do.

424
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,780
Speaker 0: - Like I would say, we'll fly to PAX Australia and PAX South from here, you don't necessarily need to do all those same things.

425
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,600
Speaker 1: if I can go to the coral reef this time.

426
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:25,140
Speaker 0: - Nah, maybe we'll take turns, maybe I'll skip it, you go to this one, and then Geek Nights has been to every PAX since 2008.

427
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,239
Speaker 1: - Go to the coral reef without you.

428
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:30,980
Speaker 1: - Yeah, 'cause the worst thing is, - You wanna buy me an underwater camera thingy or just bring GoPro?

429
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,660
Speaker 1: - If I went to the coral reef, I'd probably buy the newer, I'm waiting, the new GoPro should be out later this year, I guess it'll be GoPro 5?

430
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,700
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I'm glad I held out, 'cause I haven't used mine that much except skiing, really.

431
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,660
Speaker 1: - I used mine for biking, but yeah, I mean, the one I have now only does 1080p 30, the current one I think does 4K 30.

432
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,795
Speaker 0: - It does some crazy shit, the thing is, forget the 4K, you wanna--.

433
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,396
Speaker 1: - The newer ones gotta do 4K 60, right?

434
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,400
Speaker 0: - No, you stay down at like the 720 and 180p, but then you have the ridiculous frame rate.

435
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,880
Speaker 1: - You don't need the ridiculous frame rate.

436
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:57,960
Speaker 0: - For skiing, ridiculous frame rate.

437
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,599
Speaker 1: - That means you can do the slow-mos, but I don't need the ridiculous frame rate for the fishies.

438
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,779
Speaker 0: - No, not for the fishies.

439
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,554
Speaker 1: - I wanna see the fishies in 4K.

440
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,254
Speaker 0: - Huh?

441
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, for the fishies, I'd use the 4K.

442
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,079
Speaker 0: - 4K fishies, anyway.

443
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,740
Speaker 0: - Plus high frame rate, low light, anyway.

444
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:19,460
Speaker 1: - Okay, so, during the Steam sale which just happened, there were many games available, and one of them was Wolfenstein, The New Order, also Wolfenstein The Old Blood, which I guess is some sort of extra game.

445
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:32,120
Speaker 1: They're basically newer, I guess, remakes of, not remakes at all, actually, just new Wolfenstein games, 'cause it is the original Wolfenstein, the 2D, then there's Wolfenstein-- - Which was made before we were born.

446
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,937
Speaker 1: - Then there's Wolfenstein 3D, the real first Wolfenstein, you know.

447
00:30:36,603 --> 00:30:37,900
Speaker 1: Brian Lavin, that one, right?

448
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:44,318
Speaker 1: Then there was those ones sorta in the Quake III era, that I think they were actually using the Quake III engine, and no, I didn't really care about those at all.

449
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:48,760
Speaker 1: And now there's these new ones, and I was just sorta in the mood for a single-player FPS.

450
00:30:48,942 --> 00:30:50,659
Speaker 1: I just wanna walk around, shoot guys, whatevs.

451
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:52,836
Speaker 1: Hey, Wolfenstein, I like Wolfenstein 3D.

452
00:30:53,461 --> 00:30:55,600
Speaker 1: I wonder how much Wolfenstein is in this Wolfenstein.

453
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,759
Speaker 1: And I can tell you there's a lot more Wolfenstein in it than there was in those Quake III era ones.

454
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:07,739
Speaker 1: But basically, it's a single-player FPS, and it's super, triple-A, generic in terms of its structure, right?

455
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,619
Speaker 1: It's like, do some stuff, watch an FMV, do some stuff, watch an FMV, plot, plot, plot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

456
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,540
Speaker 1: The shooting isn't that particularly exciting, right?

457
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,399
Speaker 1: It's not like there's anything special about the shooting part.

458
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,700
Speaker 0: - So what game is it most like?

459
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,400
Speaker 0: 'Cause honestly, the last triple-A-- - Every FPS that's genero.

460
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,380
Speaker 0: - So iron sights?

461
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,760
Speaker 1: - Uh, sort of, right?

462
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:35,432
Speaker 1: I mean, some of the weapons have different sights, but yeah, I mean, usually you'll, it's not, it's like, when you right-click to, 'cause I love default controls, you right-click to aim.

463
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:40,259
Speaker 1: If the gun has iron sights, the gun will come up, but it's right in the middle of the screen.

464
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:53,300
Speaker 1: So it's not like, it's not like, you know, it's not like, you know, the iron sight part matters, really, plus when you're not, when you don't have, when you're not holding the gun up to aim, there's on-screen sights.

465
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,279
Speaker 1: It's not only iron sights.

466
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,820
Speaker 1: There's, you know, it's like Counter-Strike.

467
00:31:56,181 --> 00:32:03,620
Speaker 0: - So I'm not gonna lie, the last single-player, triple-A, first-person game that I played all the way through was Deus Ex Human Revolution.

468
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,700
Speaker 1: - So Deus Ex, I wasn't into that game.

469
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,840
Speaker 0: - I'm super into that game.

470
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:13,879
Speaker 1: - But I can tell you the shooting part of that game is a million times superior to the shooting part of the Wolfenstein game, 'cause it wasn't genero.

471
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:16,020
Speaker 1: You could actually do stuff in that.

472
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,220
Speaker 1: You know, you had different aspects of shooting it.

473
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:21,140
Speaker 1: This is just literally, walk around, shoot some guys.

474
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:35,319
Speaker 1: I beat every area using my basic strategy, which is find cover, hide behind that cover, picking guys off until there are no more guys, move only when there are no more guys, go and find the remaining guys if there are any and eliminate them, and I did that every single part of the game, and it worked.

475
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,100
Speaker 0: - Huh, it's kind of a shame.

476
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,498
Speaker 0: Was there any, like, tactics to the shooting, or was it just--?

477
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,059
Speaker 1: - No, the shooting was the most boring.

478
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:56,579
Speaker 1: I mean, it was like, I got what I wanted, which was go around shooting guys, but there was nothing particularly exciting about the shooting part, other than you could, if a grenade was thrown at you, if you could aim at the grenade and push E, you could throw the grenade back, which is kind of cool.

479
00:32:57,341 --> 00:32:59,218
Speaker 1: That was like their clever mechanic, or just throw a grenade back.

480
00:33:00,222 --> 00:33:01,800
Speaker 1: You could do some stealthiness if you wanted.

481
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,377
Speaker 1: It was kind of easy to do.

482
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:20,079
Speaker 1: You know, you can get up behind a guy and middle click to sort of kill him with a knife quietly, or use the silenced pistol to kill a guy quietly, and there were certain areas where, clearly they wanted you to do that, and you could do it, you know, to get away with progressing a little more quickly instead of, you know, attracting the attention of every Nazi in the area.

483
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:20,651
Speaker 0: - Nah.

484
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:29,040
Speaker 0: So in terms of, 'cause like, Wolfenstein 3D, like, when I think of Wolfenstein, I always think about, it's Explorer Maze, and the shooting and everything is kind of ancillary.

485
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:40,440
Speaker 1: - So, the shooting wasn't ancillary in this one, but there were a lot, you know, they really did try to make it a lot like Wolfenstein 3D in ways such as there are a lot of secrets to find, right?

486
00:33:40,843 --> 00:33:56,478
Speaker 1: You can really go through every area looking for secrets, and secret areas, and all that kind of stuff, just like the original Wolfenstein 3D, and that part, I like that part, because some of the secrets are pretty well hidden, you know, vents, and things you could destroy, and, you know, a little bit of platforming, a little bit of pushing here and there.

487
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,680
Speaker 0: - I don't know, it's hard to sell me on vent-based gameplay.

488
00:33:58,861 --> 00:34:01,360
Speaker 0: if I played Deus Ex, 'cause Deus Ex is the vent game.

489
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,099
Speaker 1: - This, I mean, this has the same amount of vents that, you know, an FPS is expected to have.

490
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,280
Speaker 0: - Okay, it's not like the Deus Ex of like, there is guaranteed to be a vent everywhere.

491
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,268
Speaker 1: - No, no, no, no.

492
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:10,496
Speaker 1: Not at all.

493
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,199
Speaker 1: You know, but it wasn't very maze-like.

494
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,560
Speaker 1: It's pretty much go, you know, figure out how to get to the next area, right?

495
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:17,498
Speaker 1: Kind of stuff.

496
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,899
Speaker 1: It wasn't, you didn't have to like, you know, search.

497
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,860
Speaker 1: But I guess Wolfenstein 3D, even though it was a maze, we sort of were just sort of also going ahead, right?

498
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,900
Speaker 1: Get the key, open the door, go to the next area, whatnot.

499
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:28,918
Speaker 1: So, whatever.

500
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:40,639
Speaker 1: The things that stood about this game were, the plot is, the plot had some positive aspects, but was mostly a ridiculous stereotypical triple-A game plot that was so groan-inducing.

501
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,859
Speaker 0: - Oh, no.

502
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,560
Speaker 1: - Right?

503
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:45,442
Speaker 1: So, you have the good parts of the plot where that.

504
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:50,878
Speaker 1: basically, it tries to explain the ridiculousness that was present in Wolfenstein 3D.

505
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,139
Speaker 1: Like, why are people holding, why is there a ridiculous Nazi in like, a robot suit?

506
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,000
Speaker 1: And why are there ridiculous Nazi Frankenstein?

507
00:34:57,801 --> 00:35:00,520
Speaker 0: - No, no, in a way, that sort of retcon, like, Adventure Time does that.

508
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,440
Speaker 0: Like, hey, what was the deal with that thing way back in season one?

509
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,360
Speaker 1: - Right, so basically, the story here is basically the story of Captain America.

510
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:05,808
Speaker 1: B.J.

511
00:35:05,828 --> 00:35:06,300
Speaker 1: Blazkowicz.

512
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,437
Speaker 0: (laughing) - I faked my dude.

513
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,880
Speaker 0: - He basically-- - Oh, he has his own Wikipedia article.

514
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:18,073
Speaker 1: - Yeah, he takes some damage, basically, and is holed up in an asylum for a long-ass time, from the '40s all the way to the '60s.

515
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:25,054
Speaker 1: And then in the '60s, the Nazis come and shut down the asylum, and he wakes up from his vegetative state, and is B.J.

516
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:25,920
Speaker 1: Blazkowicz again.

517
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:34,758
Speaker 1: But the Nazis have won, and they have all sorts of ridiculous technologies, including, I'm gonna spoil the fuck out of this, 'cause who gives a shit, right?

518
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,980
Speaker 0: - Yep, so that's fine.

519
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,879
Speaker 1: - Including Nazi moon base that you go to in one of the last levels.

520
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,420
Speaker 0: - That's kind of expected.

521
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:46,741
Speaker 1: - And after he escapes, at the beginning of the game, the plot is actually sort of reasonable, and based in, you know-- -

522
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:53,779
Speaker 0: They should've made it on Mars, and then they could've made it be a UAC facility, and then it turns out that UAC was just a Nazi science program, and linked it to Doom.

523
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,476
Speaker 1: - They could've.

524
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,240
Speaker 0: - If you're gonna go crazy, that's the only advice I have, I'll let you continue.

525
00:35:57,681 --> 00:35:59,940
Speaker 0: If you're gonna go crazy, just go all the way crazy.

526
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,060
Speaker 1: - They did go all the way-- - Go Metal Gear.

527
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,020
Speaker 1: - They went all the way crazy.

528
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:04,777
Speaker 1: Basically, you hook up with the Resistance again, right?

529
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:14,380
Speaker 1: As soon as you hook up with the Resistance, shit is insane, because the Resistance is the most ridiculous band of characters that only someone who likes AAA game plots could love.

530
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:53,320
Speaker 1: You've got the ex-Nazi who's taking care of the giant dude with brain damage who's still a child at heart, and has toys in his room, and the tough old lady who's in a wheelchair 'cause her legs are smashed up, who's in charge of things, and your girlfriend who's the smart girl who you escaped from the asylum with, and she was the nurse who took care of you when you were a vegetable, and the crazy math girl who's totally insane, and you choose one of two people to rescue at the beginning of the game, and the Nazis kill the other one, so you can either go with the English Scottish friend guy who's a veteran, or the young, promising Private Wyatt.

531
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,851
Speaker 1: I chose the old dude, and then there's a scene where he's like, "You should've picked Private Wyatt," and it's like, "Oh, come on, bro,

532
00:36:58,993 --> 00:36:59,315
Speaker 1: whatever.".

533
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,779
Speaker 1: If I choose you, I looked it up online, right?

534
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,500
Speaker 1: If I choose you, I get health upgrades throughout the game.

535
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:04,779
Speaker 1: Private Wyatt doesn't do Jack.

536
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,227
Speaker 1: Yeah.

537
00:37:06,248 --> 00:37:06,480
Speaker 1: - Really?

538
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,520
Speaker 1: - The game is only slightly different based on that choice.

539
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,059
Speaker 1: The ending is basically the same goddamn thing.

540
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,760
Speaker 0: - Yeah, well, the endings, I mean, even "Day of Sex,".

541
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,575
Speaker 0: the end was literally, "Here are four

542
00:37:14,615 --> 00:37:14,978
Speaker 0: buttons.".

543
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,140
Speaker 1: - Right, and then they tried to explain where all the Nazi technology comes from.

544
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:42,279
Speaker 1: Basically, there was a group of Jews called Dat Yechud who developed all the secret technology simply for the sake of it, because inventing things is their religion, and they keep all the secret technology hidden away, and you rescue, basically, one of the Jews who's like the old Jewish guy from Independence Day, basically, from a concentration camp, and he hooks you up with the crazy technology of awesomeness.

545
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,555
Speaker 0: - Oh, see, also "Doom

546
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:43,760
Speaker 0: Guy.".

547
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,440
Speaker 0: "Doom Guy" also has his own Wikipedia.

548
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,980
Speaker 1: - Right, and it's just, the plot is so crazy.

549
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:49,712
Speaker 1: It's just like, "Oh, my God,

550
00:37:49,732 --> 00:37:50,056
Speaker 1: really?".

551
00:37:50,481 --> 00:38:35,339
Speaker 1: It's like, every time, the more crazier the plot got, I was just like, and then, so there's all these gratuitous sex scenes between you and the girl you escaped from the asylum with that were unnecessary, and this gratuitous violent scenes for no reason, and it's just like, and then it's like they get to a point where it's like everything is chapter-based, so you'll go on a mission, it's like, go to the prison, you bust everyone out, then you'll be back at the, you know, the base of normal people doing some fetch quests inside your base, fetch quests in an FPS, then you go out on another mission, and then some more fetch quests back at the base, and then another mission, and then fetch quests back at the base, and then after the second to last mission, the base is destroyed, mission in the base, it's like, oh, the Nazis are in your base, shoot them, right, it's like, the base is on fire.

552
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,420
Speaker 0: - I feel like fetch quests were played out in about 1992.

553
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:45,436
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's like, find the secret places in the base where you can find the items and learn about the people in the base, it's like, I don't give a shit, just I wanna shoot Nazis.

554
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,473
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

555
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:46,677
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

556
00:38:47,240 --> 00:39:00,840
Speaker 1: So, I guess if you like, you know, stereotypical FPS plots that are really bad, and you don't find that groan-inducing, I guess it's a Patrick Rothfuss level of plot here, right?

557
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,324
Speaker 0: - Wait, so there's a bunch of girls that I could date, but I won't?

558
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:09,180
Speaker 1: - No, there's the one girl that you basically have sex with immediately, and then have sex with again, and whatever.

559
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,477
Speaker 0: - Can I choose not to have sex?

560
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,405
Speaker 0: - No, you can't.

561
00:39:11,426 --> 00:39:12,480
Speaker 0: - That's great, that's a shame.

562
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:12,764
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

563
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:17,158
Speaker 0: - I'm really, really feeling great about that 48 gigabyte download that I could just delete now.

564
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,393
Speaker 1: - I mean, and then you shoot a bunch of Nazis with the same weapon.

565
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:25,100
Speaker 0: - These are the shootings that I've seen, I could just play Day of Sex Human Revolution and pretend the enemies are Nazis, and I'll feel just as good.

566
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,740
Speaker 1: - So I started that, then I just started playing the other one, 'cause I paid for it, right?

567
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,838
Speaker 1: Why not shoot some more Nazis?

568
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:56,519
Speaker 1: Wolfenstein, The Old Blood, so Wolfenstein, The Old Blood actually takes place in the past, not in the future, you know, before, it's against a prequel, and so far, it's much better, because this less ridiculous plot, way less ridiculous plot, it's pretty much like, well, the Nazis are winning this war, go to Castle Wolfenstein and find this secret code or something, it's like, all right, it's just level one, you know, chapter one picks off or chapter two left off, there isn't this disjointedness of going back to base and having a completely different chapter.

569
00:39:56,822 --> 00:40:06,095
Speaker 1: that's, you know, so separated, it's pretty much just one big long mission in a big Nazi castle, I just save the game after I open the front gate, and I'm going in.

570
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,200
Speaker 0: - That's, we'll play that one first instead.

571
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,899
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, you really don't need to play the second one to understand, the actual first one to understand the prequel, right?

572
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,998
Speaker 0: - Maybe what I should actually do is just play Doom 2 again, but in a second monitor, watch Inglorious Basterds.

573
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:24,436
Speaker 1: - I guess you could do that.

574
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,940
Speaker 1: - I guess it sounds like-- - You can just play Wolfenstein 3D.

575
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,320
Speaker 0: - It sounds like I need two punctuated pornography scenes on a third monitor to fully replicate the experience.

576
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:45,580
Speaker 1: - Uh, oh, there's one more thing I say about this game is that there's one thing that it uses over and over and over again, and it's not quite a jump scare, it's maybe a subset of jump scare, right?

577
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:45,919
Speaker 1: - All right.

578
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,074
Speaker 1: - Even the old blood keeps reusing.

579
00:40:48,135 --> 00:40:57,040
Speaker 0: the same thing, the same sort of trope happens like 100 times in these games, which could be fun, like in Doom, the trope is, oh shit, the lights go out and you're surrounded by monsters.

580
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:04,719
Speaker 1: - Right, the trope worked the first time, and after that, the second time they did it, it's like, oh, I guess it's a trope, and then they kept doing it over and over and over again.

581
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:15,798
Speaker 1: And it's basically, for example, you'll see a vent, and you'll be like, well, that's the place to go, you'll climb up into the vent, and there's like one of the Nazi characters in there and grabs you, right?

582
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,100
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, I guess it's cutscene time, right?

583
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,360
Speaker 1: You've been captured by Nazis, you know?

584
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:27,878
Speaker 1: And it's like, you'll be walking down a hallway, and it's like, you'll have to open a door, so it's like, you'll open the door, and then the big Nazi comes out and grabs you.

585
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,100
Speaker 0: - See, that happened once in Metal Gear, and it was fine.

586
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:39,678
Speaker 1: - There was a part where it's like, well, I guess I have to do the speedy run jump to get over this broken catwalk, and you get to the other side, and around the corner comes a giant Nazi robot that grabs you.

587
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:53,720
Speaker 1: And it's like, you just keep getting captured by things that come around corners, out of vents, or whatever, to sort of end the section that you're in, and take you into the next cutscene plot part, where you're captured by Nazis or something.

588
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,120
Speaker 1: And this happens like a zillion fucking times.

589
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,760
Speaker 0: - I guess this reminds us why-- - So many times.

590
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,698
Speaker 0: - The number of, like, FPSs in particular, there are a lot of them, like AAA FPSs.

591
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:09,338
Speaker 0: Very few of them do anything interesting, or have any serious craft put into them, at least from a game design perspective.

592
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,379
Speaker 1: - It's like Half-Life 2 came out more than 10 years ago.

593
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,040
Speaker 1: We were in college.

594
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,780
Speaker 0: - Might be the best ever, still.

595
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,140
Speaker 1: - Right, it's like, why aren't you, like, you haven't learned any of the lessons, from Half-Life 2, have you?

596
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,639
Speaker 1: Half-Life 2 had no cutscenes.

597
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,860
Speaker 1: Everything was in the game engine at all times.

598
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,839
Speaker 1: There's no reason your game should not be doing that.

599
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:27,540
Speaker 1: They didn't stop and have a chapter, right?

600
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,600
Speaker 1: Gordon Freeman is going from place to place to place.

601
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,239
Speaker 1: There's never any question of like, well, how did he get from there to there, or anything like that.

602
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,920
Speaker 1: It's like, literally, he's 100% from beginning to end.

603
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,780
Speaker 1: Every step Gordon Freeman takes is a step you take, right?

604
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:49,600
Speaker 1: It's like, if I'm making an FPS, I'm starting at Half-Life 2 and progressing from there, not progressing backwards, right, to an older time before Half-Life 2 existed.

605
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,259
Speaker 1: Why would I do that?

606
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:58,120
Speaker 0: - Unless you're going to that older time to then take an element that was dropped and focus on it, like Serious Sam did for that Doom-style gameplay.

607
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,459
Speaker 1: - Right, of course, but that's not what this is.

608
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,800
Speaker 0: - That's not what this is, it sounds like.

609
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,060
Speaker 1: - This is a single-player plot FPS.

610
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:05,959
Speaker 1: You should at least do everything Half-Life 2 does, and more.

611
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,099
Speaker 1: You shouldn't be doing the cutscene nonsense and whatnot.

612
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,060
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean, it's surprising, though, how much Wolfenstein feel.

613
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:14,980
Speaker 1: They were able to get into this game.

614
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:17,060
Speaker 1: It's like a lot of homage to the old Wolfenstein.

615
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,819
Speaker 0: - I can take that.

616
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:35,635
Speaker 1: - And there's even a part where you go to bed, and then you go to a nightmare, which is the first level of Wolfenstein 3D, but you're controlling it like it's the new game with the new weapons, but the map is old Wolfenstein, the bad guys are old Wolfenstein, but you have the new weapons and the character control, right?

617
00:43:36,222 --> 00:43:40,832
Speaker 1: All the secrets are easy to find because when you walk up next to a wall that has a secret, the little thing highlights up, it says, "Press

618
00:43:40,933 --> 00:43:40,953
Speaker 1: E.".

619
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,589
Speaker 0: That's nice.

620
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,418
Speaker 1: - Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man.

621
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,700
Speaker 1: - Well, I didn't want to bother finding the stupid secrets.

622
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,340
Speaker 1: I mean, I knew where they were in that level, right?

623
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:57,518
Speaker 1: In the second one, I got to the part where you play the next level of Wolfenstein 3D, which is great.

624
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,020
Speaker 0: - You remember the Wolfenstein levels in Doom 2?

625
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,279
Speaker 1: - Yeah, at the end with Commander Keen.

626
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,279
Speaker 1: - Yep, yep.

627
00:44:02,401 --> 00:44:04,620
Speaker 1: - And the Cyberdemon or whatever.

628
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,459
Speaker 1: - Yep.

629
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,344
Speaker 1: - Anyway, the one other thing about this game is, you know how?

630
00:44:08,364 --> 00:44:12,320
Speaker 1: in Half-Life 2, there's a gravity gun, which is sort of like, there's always that one weapon that's not just a shooting weapon?

631
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,860
Speaker 1: - In this one, it's the laser craft work.

632
00:44:15,842 --> 00:44:23,919
Speaker 1: So at one point, you find a laser cutter and you can use the laser cutter to sort of cut open fences and cut chains and things like that to progress and get into secret areas.

633
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:31,080
Speaker 1: You have to recharge it by finding things on the wall that are basically power recharging stations and you press E and it recharges the laser cutter.

634
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,180
Speaker 1: Eventually, you find the laser craft work, which is like a super laser cutter that can cut even open better things, right?

635
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,480
Speaker 1: Thicker things, including certain--.

636
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,719
Speaker 0: - It can pick up the darker rocks.

637
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,479
Speaker 1: - Right, exactly.

638
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,579
Speaker 1: It can cut open crates you couldn't just smash open and whatnot.

639
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,673
Speaker 1: It can open secrets.

640
00:44:45,693 --> 00:44:47,740
Speaker 1: you couldn't just, it's also actually useful as a weapon.

641
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,158
Speaker 1: It has two modes, you can switch between weapon mode and cutting mode.

642
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:57,880
Speaker 1: And then you find all these upgrades for it, like a scope and like an auto shot and all these upgrades for it, so it gets crazy powerful.

643
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,940
Speaker 1: But when you use the scope method, it can like target multiple enemies at once.

644
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,899
Speaker 1: You fire once and it shoots all of them at one shot with like perfect aim, but then it uses all its energy in like one go.

645
00:45:08,321 --> 00:45:11,819
Speaker 1: But it's useful because if you run out of ammo for all the other guns, you can always use the laser craft work.

646
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:14,360
Speaker 0: - Well, just like the bug gun in Half-Life.

647
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,099
Speaker 1: - Right, and when you fight like the giant, giant robot near the end of the game, you have to use the laser craft work to mess with it, right, and whatnot.

648
00:45:20,682 --> 00:45:24,020
Speaker 1: So, you know, 'cause you're gonna run out of ammo if you try to shoot it with your other weapon.

649
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,899
Speaker 1: So there's some interesting things going on with that mechanic.

650
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:30,680
Speaker 1: It's not as good as the gravity gun, but I imagine it was a lot easier for them to program.

651
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,960
Speaker 1: And I guess it's more Nazi themed, you know, laser craft.

652
00:45:36,142 --> 00:45:41,260
Speaker 1: So if you wanna shoot some Nazis, maybe find some secrets, you're in the mood to shoot some AI controlled dudes.

653
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,680
Speaker 1: You know, this game was way cheap during the Steam sale.

654
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,055
Speaker 1: But if you--.

655
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,440
Speaker 0: - It's not cheap anymore, so I wouldn't buy it necessarily.

656
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,180
Speaker 1: - No, I got it for a ridiculous cheap Steam sale price.

657
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,680
Speaker 0: - Yeah, wait for it to be on sale again.

658
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,394
Speaker 1: - It will be.

659
00:45:54,463 --> 00:46:07,520
Speaker 1: And if you don't like a single player FPS, if you're bothered by a really bad plot with really wacky characters and nonsense, then you probably shouldn't, maybe you only want the plot with nonsense, you can probably watch it on YouTube, right?

660
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:12,080
Speaker 1: I guess it's all these collectibles, like find all the enigma codes and find all the golden bits.

661
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,160
Speaker 0: - Well, I care about that to a negative degree in all games.

662
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:20,559
Speaker 1: - The only other mechanic I haven't talked about is the perk mechanic, which is like the way to level up.

663
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,119
Speaker 0: - Is it like Dave's X?

664
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,780
Speaker 1: - I don't know what Dave's X is like, but it's basically--.

665
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:28,399
Speaker 0: - So you basically, you get like an upgrade point and then you have like a bunch of different areas you can spend it that have like trees.

666
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,278
Speaker 1: - It's not like that.

667
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,279
Speaker 1: So for example, it'll be like, oh, you want the knife upgrade, huh, to where you can hold more throwing knives?

668
00:46:34,663 --> 00:46:40,308
Speaker 1: Well, get this achievement of, kill X guys with throwing knives, and then it'll unlock.

669
00:46:40,348 --> 00:46:45,240
Speaker 1: the hold more throwing knives, and then it'll unlock more achievements you can accomplish, which will unlock more upgrades.

670
00:46:45,581 --> 00:46:48,200
Speaker 1: I basically completely ignored them and had no problems beating the game whatsoever.

671
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,160
Speaker 0: - That's fine, maybe I'll just try it on a harder difficulty.

672
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:57,160
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, I played on Bring 'Em On, the only things above that are Hurt Me Plenty, or I guess Hurt Me Plenty's after that, right?

673
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:57,918
Speaker 1: And then Uber?

674
00:46:59,040 --> 00:46:59,356
Speaker 1: - Uber?

675
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,750
Speaker 1: - Oh no, it was.

676
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:03,259
Speaker 1: I Am Death incarnate, and then they added Uber after that.

677
00:47:03,886 --> 00:47:04,837
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played Bring 'Em On.

678
00:47:12,074 --> 00:47:14,300
Speaker 0: - This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

679
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,440
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
