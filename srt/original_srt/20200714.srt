1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,428
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday July 14th 2020.

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,516
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,320
Speaker 1: We were talking about console modding.

4
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,338
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:22,900
Speaker 1: So, uh, you know, I'm pretty particular about my phones my smartphones.

6
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:31,585
Speaker 1: I like them to be small but still full-featured like there are tiny Android phones, but those tiny Android phones are like Garbage phones.

7
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:42,826
Speaker 1: Yep, and there were small Android phones But the last one that anyone made as far as I can find that was worth a damn is the Sony Xperia zx1 or xz1.

8
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:44,471
Speaker 1: I just forget the order of those two letters.

9
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:47,660
Speaker 0: comes that is that is that running an unmodified Android?

10
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,246
Speaker 1: While it is not unmodified Android.

11
00:00:50,346 --> 00:01:00,580
Speaker 1: the weird thing about Sony unlike all the other phone manufacturers that put their bullshit on there The Sony Android is 99% regular Android and stays up to date.

12
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:04,299
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's that you have the newest possible Android whatever the one that is.

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,808
Speaker 1: Yep, I'm very I'm very clear.

14
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:07,559
Speaker 1: I have Android 9 something right now.

15
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:09,400
Speaker 0: What's the newest Andrew?

16
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,325
Speaker 1: I don't know what the newest one is offhand.

17
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:15,196
Speaker 1: actually cuz I was just checking this stuff out.

18
00:01:15,196 --> 00:01:16,720
Speaker 0: 11 your two versions behind.

19
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:17,145
Speaker 0: That's fine.

20
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,263
Speaker 1: I can live with that But does it not have 11?

21
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:24,461
Speaker 1: I think I can get it to 11.

22
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:24,740
Speaker 1: I'm fun.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,580
Speaker 1: So the reason this comes up is my phone is multi multiple years old and finally running out of steam.

24
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:34,749
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, like the battery is starting to not last that long.

25
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,260
Speaker 1: but way back I bought a second copy of this phone.

26
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:47,356
Speaker 1: Yep, just in case to hold out and I'm pretty sure once that second one dies I'm just gonna go iPhone because there are no Android phones worth a shit after this.

27
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:57,120
Speaker 1: and in fact Sony their compact phones are now like So much bigger than this phone that it like they're bigger than an iPhone like that's their compact phone.

28
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:59,031
Speaker 1: Also, they have a weird bulbous back.

29
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,339
Speaker 1: So I'm a little annoyed by that.

30
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:02,689
Speaker 1: But here's the weird thing that happened.

31
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:03,975
Speaker 1: I got this other phone out.

32
00:02:04,377 --> 00:02:05,100
Speaker 1: I start setting it up.

33
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:17,540
Speaker 1: It's obviously running like fucking Android 6 something and I got to run through a million upgrades and it's been churning and upgrading all day, but then I go to doubt to Restore my backup from my current phone to the second one.

34
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,434
Speaker 1: So I can have two phones that are basically identical and it won't see my backup.

35
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:23,139
Speaker 1: and I'm like, alright, what's going on?

36
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:28,060
Speaker 1: So then I just start setting it up without the backup because I don't there's nothing on my phone to back up.

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,692
Speaker 1: Everything's backed up like independently of the phone backup.

38
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:33,283
Speaker 1: I don't need data from my apps Yep.

39
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:33,764
Speaker 0: Yep.

40
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:44,220
Speaker 1: So I just started setting it up and it says swipe your fingerprint and I'm like There's no fingerprint sensor in this phone because my phone does not have a functional fingerprint sensor.

41
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:52,445
Speaker 1: When they release this phone the European models as far as I could tell had a fingerprint sensor But we're missing some LTE bands.

42
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:58,040
Speaker 1: the US specific version of the phone had all the LTE bands, but no fingerprint sensor.

43
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,662
Speaker 1: No one would explain why.

44
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,767
Speaker 1: the best anyone's guess is which I think is very plausible.

45
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:13,659
Speaker 1: Is that there is a patent on hiding the fingerprint sensor like inside of the power button and That patent seems to only matter in the US.

46
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:20,439
Speaker 1: So they basically released a version of the phone without the fingerprint sensor Only in the US and the whole rest of the world got the fingerprint sensor.

47
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:27,840
Speaker 1: Okay Turns out I have the second phone I bought is the European version of the phone and it has the fingerprint sensor.

48
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:30,578
Speaker 0: oops, so your backup phone is not a.

49
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:40,299
Speaker 1: But as far as I can tell it does have the bands that when I researched these models It said it wasn't supposed to have.

50
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:42,597
Speaker 1: So I dug into it a little deeper.

51
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:47,020
Speaker 1: My US phone also has a fingerprint sensor.

52
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:54,100
Speaker 1: There is US specific firmware that turns off the fingerprint sensor and hides it from the OS.

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,304
Speaker 1: Aha It's been in there the whole time.

54
00:03:58,345 --> 00:03:59,047
Speaker 1: the hardware is there.

55
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:04,028
Speaker 1: that button that I thought was just a button for like four years is Actually a fingerprint sensor.

56
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,054
Speaker 0: How about that?

57
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:13,290
Speaker 1: So I wiped it because I'm just fucking with my phone anyway, and I put With the utility for me and I put the European firmware on.

58
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,096
Speaker 1: that fingerprint sensor works.

59
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:22,740
Speaker 1: Of course I can't tell if the missing LTE bands are working or not though, and I don't have a good way to test that.

60
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:28,000
Speaker 0: So yeah, see this is this is part of the like unseen advantages of iPhone, right?

61
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, like iPhone 6s 6s from like four years ago gets the newest updates.

62
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:36,382
Speaker 0: the updates come automatically Right.

63
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,292
Speaker 0: everyone has with an iPhone has the newest version.

64
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,660
Speaker 0: You don't have to worry about any not having the newest one.

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is zero bullshit from carriers on the phone.

66
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:56,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, and because everyone's got an iPhone When it is necessary for like carrier firmware updates to happen to like adjust the radios They just show up automatically like once in a blue moon.

67
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:59,960
Speaker 0: They'll be like a message like there's a carrier update from Verizon push.

68
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:12,032
Speaker 0: Yes, I'll be like, yes, and then something happens and it's like okay and you can go into settings and check it Right and see what carrier, you know firmwares are in there whatever but you know That's how it is.

69
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:19,179
Speaker 1: Yep So right now both phones are cycling and like bit by bit after updating themselves back to the latest latest version of Android.

70
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:24,328
Speaker 0: and Since I'm in the house and I don't go outside that much It's like the phone is actually.

71
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:26,840
Speaker 0: it's like I was gonna buy the new iPhone.

72
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:31,460
Speaker 0: Presumably I was gonna consider it at least based on what had you know, what it contains?

73
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,197
Speaker 0: Yeah in September when this new I've I got hiccup suddenly.

74
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:42,460
Speaker 0: Yeah There's gonna be new iPhones in September I was considering upgrading cuz I got iPhone 7 where there's nothing wrong with it, but it is old, right?

75
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,930
Speaker 0: and It's like well now I barely use the phone.

76
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,975
Speaker 0: I'm inside all the time.

77
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:49,020
Speaker 0: I just use tablet.

78
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:52,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, or you know consider part of the reason I was thinking about upgrading it like.

79
00:05:53,036 --> 00:06:01,800
Speaker 1: maybe I could wait till Reason I got the old phone out is because the new phone and the old phone not just cuz the batteries going low.

80
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:06,973
Speaker 1: It's not that I need it that much It's that I don't need to like have a SIM card in both phones.

81
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:12,045
Speaker 1: if I'm always in my apartment if I just want to Look at my phone like randomly around the house I could use either phone.

82
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:16,343
Speaker 1: the SIM card doesn't do anything for me unless I leave Wi-Fi mmm.

83
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:19,335
Speaker 1: Anyway, yep, so we'll see.

84
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,018
Speaker 1: now I'll just have two phones.

85
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:29,295
Speaker 1: But the clever thing I'm gonna do that's I've seen other people do I can get both of the phones to have the same totp for my Google stuff.

86
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,067
Speaker 1: So they can be backups for each other.

87
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:35,639
Speaker 1: I just scan the same barcode twice with two different phones when I set it up.

88
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:37,393
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you can do that.

89
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:42,580
Speaker 0: Yep, so My strategy has been to print out the piece of paper with the backup codes on it.

90
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,065
Speaker 1: I do that as well.

91
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:46,794
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I have a YubiKey for some things.

92
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:48,380
Speaker 1: But yeah, that was my phone Odyssey.

93
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:58,247
Speaker 1: I'm trying to figure out if there are any actual hardware differences between these two phones or if it's literally just they fucked up the firmware specifically in the US Probably the firmware.

94
00:06:58,408 --> 00:06:58,730
Speaker 1: Yep.

95
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:10,220
Speaker 1: So in some gaming news Microsoft flight simulator on one I see some people who are like going crazy about this announcement and I see other people Who are this one's the last time there's been a Microsoft lights?

96
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I see a lot of other people especially a lot of younger gamers not understanding why people are going crazy about this update.

97
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:22,660
Speaker 0: Well, you got so in the 90s, right when people were first starting to get more powerful computers in their home.

98
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:37,391
Speaker 0: 386 is 486 is yeah Was like there was a lot of software That existed for PCs that tried to make PCs look powerful and impressive Sometimes by cheating and sometimes not by cheating right.

99
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,680
Speaker 0: so mist is like to see the biggest criminal.

100
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,846
Speaker 0: People don't know everything in.

101
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,272
Speaker 0: mist was pre-rendered.

102
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:45,060
Speaker 0: So they had big fancy computers.

103
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,180
Speaker 0: We're at the developers of mist right?

104
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:58,475
Speaker 0: They rendered all these 3d graphics and they created videos and they just put the videos on the CD-ROM Which had enough storage to hold the videos, right and then you would play mist.

105
00:07:58,515 --> 00:07:59,057
Speaker 0: you'd like whoa.

106
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:00,080
Speaker 0: this game looks amazing.

107
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:01,047
Speaker 0: It's like your computer.

108
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:02,720
Speaker 0: graphics card isn't rendering shit.

109
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,890
Speaker 0: You're just watching videos that are look amazing.

110
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,900
Speaker 1: Well, wait, wait, wait, you just said graphics card.

111
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,609
Speaker 1: We didn't have graphics cards back then.

112
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:09,755
Speaker 0: Some people did.

113
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:10,800
Speaker 0: you could have had a voodoo card.

114
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,190
Speaker 1: My friend can got a voodoo card like early.

115
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,500
Speaker 1: I later I got a creative graphics blaster extreme.

116
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had the TNT too was.

117
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,858
Speaker 0: but anyway, the point is is that?

118
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,166
Speaker 0: Microsoft flight simulator right actually was Real-time rendering with your computer, right?

119
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:39,738
Speaker 0: It was basically a combination like tech demo to like sell PCs Right in the 90s along with being an actual flight simulator like but for consumers not for pilots.

120
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:52,689
Speaker 0: It was sort of like this in-between space right where it was more advanced than like incredibly basic, you know like it was Shockingly realistic and accurate for it wasn't?

121
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,140
Speaker 0: it wasn't like the kind that you could use act for actual pilot training.

122
00:08:57,722 --> 00:09:05,485
Speaker 0: But if you it would sort of get you a lot of the way there right like if you played Microsoft flight simulator Seriously, right?

123
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:07,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, you you could.

124
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,973
Speaker 0: actually if you were to then go to pilot school, you would know some stuff You wouldn't feel like you couldn't skip as well.

125
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,580
Speaker 1: I actually have an anecdote there.

126
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:26,052
Speaker 1: I've really practiced flight simulator to learn like how to fly a Cessna around and then I went and flew a Cessna and That actually like taught me most of what I needed to know.

127
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:33,440
Speaker 1: it didn't really teach me take off landing But it taught me like what all the instruments do and they were accurate and like how to do different kinds of turns and how?

128
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,136
Speaker 1: To use the control surfaces, right exactly.

129
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:55,960
Speaker 0: So They haven't made microsite flight simulator in a long time because you know tech demos aren't how you sell PCs anymore and People who care about flight simulating software isn't a large market necessarily and that software Especially in modern times is difficult and expensive to develop, right?

130
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:04,211
Speaker 0: so why would you make an expensive expensive software flight simulator and Sell it to not too many people, but they're doing it.

131
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:09,452
Speaker 0: So here it comes Like I said flight simulator a new version the first version.

132
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:17,924
Speaker 0: since I don't know when the previous version was I want to say there was all version in like I Gonna google it while you talk.

133
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:27,355
Speaker 1: Microsoft released a new simulator in February of 2012 called Microsoft flight designed to replace Microsoft flight simulator aimed at drawing new users in the flight sim walk.

134
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:31,227
Speaker 1: It was simpler and Incompatible with the old flight simulator in 2014.

135
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:43,698
Speaker 0: There was a Somebody else dovetail games made Microsoft flight simulator X steam edition Like someone else made it.

136
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:46,292
Speaker 0: You can write in prep.

137
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:50,640
Speaker 0: our 3d Microsoft flight simulator X was in 2006.

138
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,548
Speaker 1: We gotta read up on this because I was not expecting to ever talk about Microsoft flight simulator again in my life Except maybe in a panel on like the history of gaming.

139
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, the point is it's a big deal and it's come back.

140
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:08,951
Speaker 1: So yeah now they even if you don't care because as a kid, I love Microsoft flight simulator But I was a kid.

141
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:15,516
Speaker 1: I had nothing better to do I'd be perfectly happy to like fly for an hour just in a normal plane.

142
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:16,560
Speaker 1: Not really doing much.

143
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,233
Speaker 0: Yeah.

144
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:25,708
Speaker 0: Also, I think a lot of the people today who are very serious about flight simulating right Microsoft has been out of the game for So long, I don't know what they're.

145
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:30,327
Speaker 0: the last time I looked into this scene, which is admittedly many years ago I think people playing X plane.

146
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:30,548
Speaker 0: right.

147
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:31,513
Speaker 0: X plane was the thing.

148
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,924
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Right.

149
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:34,988
Speaker 0: It's like there's already.

150
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:38,260
Speaker 0: yeah X plane 11 flight simulator, right?

151
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:38,822
Speaker 0: It's like.

152
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:40,610
Speaker 0: that's what I think the nerds are playing.

153
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:42,700
Speaker 0: and it's like some people fly the planes.

154
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:46,330
Speaker 0: Some people pretend to be the air traffic controllers, right?

155
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:49,560
Speaker 0: It's like they basically have a whole flight network going on of nerds.

156
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:55,742
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the listener pointed out the last proper full world version was flight simulator 2006.

157
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:56,992
Speaker 1: Okay, that was the last Microsoft one 2006.

158
00:11:56,992 --> 00:12:00,666
Speaker 1: God 14 years it is.

159
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:09,680
Speaker 1: it is a big news that they're doing it again after that If you don't care at all about flight simulators, here's why this is still really big news for you.

160
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:23,339
Speaker 1: It brings hot ass back to the table Because we were just talking about this in light of the Star Wars free-space shooter that's coming out from EA that we're cautiously Optimistic for it's EA so cautious is capitalized there.

161
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:28,259
Speaker 1: But there haven't been good joysticks except for very niche purposes for a long time.

162
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:32,086
Speaker 0: Well, they have been but it's Very niche purposes.

163
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:36,400
Speaker 1: most joysticks like ten years ago go want to buy a joystick online.

164
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:42,500
Speaker 1: Madcat's had some barely functional ones that fell apart or there were really expensive semi custom ones.

165
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,028
Speaker 1: There weren't a lot of good joysticks.

166
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:47,725
Speaker 1: unless you're willing to spend a lot of money and a lot of so I mean, I think there weren't there.

167
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:51,880
Speaker 0: they're good fight sticks for fighting fight sticks not flight sticks, right?

168
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,603
Speaker 0: It's like the.

169
00:12:52,723 --> 00:13:01,277
Speaker 0: all the games the video the major video games where people would go out of their way to buy a controller For right are all mouse and keyboard gamepad or fighting stick.

170
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:05,780
Speaker 1: Yeah It was a weird nerd would have a hot ass setup, right?

171
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,802
Speaker 0: It's only.

172
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:08,488
Speaker 0: it's like a really niche.

173
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:14,580
Speaker 0: people who are willing to spend a lot of money are the only people who've been buying those For the past quite many so many years, right?

174
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:19,220
Speaker 1: Yep, but basically what I hot ass stands for hands-on throttle and stick.

175
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,924
Speaker 1: It's basically if you're flying a plane or something like especially a fighter jet or say a tie fighter You want bait.

176
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:30,900
Speaker 1: we have one hand on a joystick to control the plane and another hand on a throttle to control the throttle.

177
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:38,550
Speaker 1: like it's a very intuitive good user experience for controlling that kind of vehicle a Flying vehicle is.

178
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:39,880
Speaker 0: that is how you want to control it?

179
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,210
Speaker 0: Yep

180
00:13:40,842 --> 00:14:00,380
Speaker 1: So if Microsoft flight simulator is coming out again for the first time in forever coupled with the Star Wars game coming I feel like it's time for there to be a mid range of hot ass or at least high-end Joysticks instead of just having the elite bespoke and on the other end literal garbage that falls apart immediately.

181
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:11,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean logitech which I think owns or bought sci-tech at some point has somewhat recently Updated like the the the top-end Hot ass they have like the x56 or something.

182
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:19,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got this shitty old like One yes thrust master which makes the sort of like military accurate ones.

183
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:23,402
Speaker 0: They're still in business so you can still shell out and get like flight stick.

184
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:27,255
Speaker 0: that looks exact and feels exactly like the ones in a real f-15 right.

185
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:28,318
Speaker 0: you can get those if you want.

186
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:45,719
Speaker 1: I If that Star Wars game is good I probably will get something like this but don't like a Thrust master hot ass that looks like that acts like an AC 10 warthogs controls like it's the same control surface or the same control 550 bucks yeah without the pedals

187
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:47,627
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm yep,

188
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:56,588
Speaker 1: but I'm kind of excited about this too Because if this kind of if this area starts to exist and that Star Wars game is good This is some of my favorite kinds of gaming.

189
00:14:56,969 --> 00:15:11,420
Speaker 1: it also means that these peripherals like I want I always wanted to get foot pads like pedals, but the last few times I looked they either were crappy or Didn't really work with the kinds of games that like a lot of the games I wanted to use them with couldn't accept input for multiple devices.

190
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:17,460
Speaker 1: Like a lot of those problems have been solved over the years I think also the people being trapped inside around the world.

191
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:23,317
Speaker 0: I've seen a somewhat a resurgence as well in people buying a home like you know.

192
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:26,569
Speaker 0: virtual racing setups You know steering wheel like the penny arcade.

193
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:29,060
Speaker 1: guys are like deep into that racing now, right?

194
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,599
Speaker 0: It's like you know it's and it even because you know the real sport people have to are doing it that way.

195
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:34,365
Speaker 0: also Right is.

196
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:38,628
Speaker 0: they're all you know Some of the actual really Airbus now.

197
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:39,671
Speaker 1: They're not just making fighter jets.

198
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:42,199
Speaker 1: They released a an Airbus control scheme.

199
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:48,555
Speaker 0: Now if you want to do some commercial simulation, I mean Microsoft flight simulator Yeah, sure.

200
00:15:50,122 --> 00:15:51,430
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's like the the home.

201
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,304
Speaker 0: You know people have enough space in their home Who are trapped there all the time.

202
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:59,560
Speaker 0: you know simulating the large vehicles that you cannot go out and ride for real?

203
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,437
Speaker 1: Which is extra fun because those are the kinds of things that were the realm of the arcade like.

204
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:05,260
Speaker 1: that was the main reason I?

205
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,947
Speaker 1: Still went to arcades once I had PCs and good consoles because there were Peripherals and controls in the arcade.

206
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:15,380
Speaker 0: I could not get at home right, but no one wants to buy an arcade.

207
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,180
Speaker 0: You know you some people want to buy an arcade.

208
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:24,482
Speaker 0: I do like the cost of an arcade machine that plays exactly one game and putting it in your house right versus Right.

209
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:33,442
Speaker 0: if you buy like a racing setup right with a wheel and pedals and three monitors right up there right and like something like that You can.

210
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:35,389
Speaker 1: actually there's more than one game.

211
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:36,272
Speaker 1: You might play with that.

212
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:41,714
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can play several racing dude And it's cheaper, it's cheaper right.

213
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:45,388
Speaker 1: I watch someone playing Overwatch with one of those rigs.

214
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:49,280
Speaker 1: they were tracer, and they were just strafing and fighting with the wheel.

215
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:53,473
Speaker 0: Yep, they did terribly I'm sure they did.

216
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:56,795
Speaker 1: So uh yeah, I the problem is now.

217
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:57,680
Speaker 1: I still gotta wait till October.

218
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,636
Speaker 1: I'm not buying as much as I want like to buy a hot ass.

219
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:09,157
Speaker 1: I'm waiting until October like 20th because Star Wars squadrons comes out October 2nd And then we need to wait and see if it is worth it.

220
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, only if we play I'm gonna play Star Wars squadrons.

221
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:13,700
Speaker 0: if we I even play it at all.

222
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:22,771
Speaker 0: I'm gonna play it with mouse and keyboard and if we play it with a group consistently frequently the game stays alive And it's like becomes a serious regular thing.

223
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:24,698
Speaker 0: then I will consider buying.

224
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:27,407
Speaker 1: yeah I'm gonna use my mad cats v1 to try it out.

225
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,120
Speaker 0: I'll use a mouse and keyboard which drifts ever slowly to the bottom left.

226
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:32,260
Speaker 1: I realized when I tried to play.

227
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:34,787
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can adjust it.

228
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:35,750
Speaker 1: Uh no.

229
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,231
Speaker 1: I can't.

230
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:36,772
Speaker 1: this thing is.

231
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:39,360
Speaker 1: this thing is pretty old and pretty crap alright.

232
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:43,473
Speaker 1: So in some other news you're stuck inside right.

233
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:45,040
Speaker 1: well SGDQ is coming.

234
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,448
Speaker 1: They published this schedule starting Sunday August 16.

235
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:54,688
Speaker 0: SGDQ is usually held around 4th of July, but This year it's held a little later obviously and it's whole.

236
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:55,911
Speaker 0: It's all online.

237
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:59,380
Speaker 0: They're not going to congregate in a single location.

238
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:14,700
Speaker 0: But the good news is that while the event will be diminished in that way it will actually Oppositely be enriched because since the participants the speedrunners don't need to travel there.

239
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:15,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

240
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:16,773
Speaker 1: I see some names.

241
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,819
Speaker 1: I haven't seen before.

242
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:29,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, that opens the door to a lot of excellent speedrunners who otherwise would not be able to be at GDQ because they would Have to travel there, which is a pain in the ass now.

243
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,780
Speaker 0: They can have speedrunners from anywhere in the world.

244
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,130
Speaker 0: There's a lot of people who are like oh, it's online.

245
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,520
Speaker 0: I guess I can submit my run now, right.

246
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:39,891
Speaker 0: And so if you look at the schedule that was just released.

247
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,080
Speaker 0: There's a lot of good shit on there.

248
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,608
Speaker 0: It's like virtual boy Wario land.

249
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:47,177
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, this is like one of the best schedules.

250
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:50,910
Speaker 1: You know Elf on the Sega Master System.

251
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:52,680
Speaker 1: I love some awful games.

252
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:56,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, those are my favorite speakers also a big fan of mine.

253
00:18:56,852 --> 00:19:03,691
Speaker 1: talk about this in a minute - quest for glory 1 But the VGA version not the unwatchable unplayable EGA version.

254
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:06,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you're into the if you like to watch GDQ.

255
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:09,952
Speaker 0: You're gonna have a good time next month.

256
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:10,920
Speaker 1: power blade.

257
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:13,284
Speaker 1: I'm just scrolling through again.

258
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:14,368
Speaker 1: I keep miss power blades.

259
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:14,969
Speaker 1: nanny s game.

260
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:15,692
Speaker 1: That was pretty good.

261
00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:16,915
Speaker 0: Never heard of it.

262
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:21,067
Speaker 1: Really Wow Can't believe you never played power blade.

263
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,312
Speaker 1: put it in emulator.

264
00:19:22,352 --> 00:19:24,300
Speaker 1: It's worth you ten minutes of that.

265
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,714
Speaker 1: You'll see what the deal is and you'll probably like it.

266
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:26,922
Speaker 0: Okay Mm-hmm.

267
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:42,055
Speaker 1: So in some other news shantay, uh, you know that the series of games I just realized there are more of those games than I thought there were but the gameboy color Version is getting re-released on a repro cart, but also on the switch.

268
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:44,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I haven't.

269
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:53,464
Speaker 0: actually I've never actually played a shantay game But what I know about them is like it's a series of platforming games that sort of has like this Underground popularity.

270
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:55,990
Speaker 0: it's like supposedly and I believe it.

271
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:03,940
Speaker 0: They're like really good platformers that just don't get the hype Proportional to their quality because they're just platforming game.

272
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,940
Speaker 0: I guess he constant low and have mostly right and have mostly been released on handheld platforms, right?

273
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:19,296
Speaker 0: So similar to like Golden Sun being a crazy good JRPG But not getting the attention of like a Final Fantasy because it's in the handheld realm, right?

274
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:20,540
Speaker 0: Even though it's sort of dead now.

275
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:23,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, has it had a new one released in forever, right?

276
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:34,459
Speaker 0: so but shantay is like they keep making more of them and they're releasing a new one soon and Along with this release of the new one They're re-releasing a lot of the old ones.

277
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:43,459
Speaker 0: So if you have it if you're like platforming games and you haven't been in the shantay scene I'm probably gonna go and check them out because I've heard so much about them.

278
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:46,646
Speaker 1: Yeah in another brief news.

279
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:47,609
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna highlight this.

280
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,540
Speaker 1: Like I said, I'm really big into the little quest for glory games.

281
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,017
Speaker 1: These are some of my favorite games of all time.

282
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,448
Speaker 1: I never noticed because I have them.

283
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:57,500
Speaker 1: I think I bought them somewhere a long time ago and I can play them in DOSBox.

284
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:03,836
Speaker 1: There's a package on Steam that packages all up and they just work with all the patches and bug fixes.

285
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:14,730
Speaker 1: The games are as Fully patched and playable as they possibly could have been on earth and it even supports the import and exporting of characters Between games because that required floppies.

286
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,200
Speaker 1: It was kind of a pain to make that work in DOSBox.

287
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:21,360
Speaker 1: They've made a launcher that makes that work to import and export characters between the games.

288
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,879
Speaker 0: So if you want to bring the key to you, I know that the standard pattern was similar to Actually golden Sun.

289
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:35,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, where you would beat you would beat quest for glory one then bring your character to two then beat the game and breeding It's a three.

290
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, could you go backwards and forward?

291
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:42,370
Speaker 0: Because the games take place in chronological order as you go Could you go forwards before you beat the game?

292
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,139
Speaker 0: Like can I play half of one and go to two?

293
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,850
Speaker 1: Nope, you beat one and eat.

294
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:51,059
Speaker 1: the end of each game Transports you or otherwise gives you access to the next place.

295
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:54,400
Speaker 0: Okay, so it's only the next place the game and go to the next one.

296
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,306
Speaker 0: You can't anything else.

297
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:57,540
Speaker 1: but there was a clever thing too where there's three classes.

298
00:21:57,681 --> 00:21:58,444
Speaker 1: Like the game is baby.

299
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:00,171
Speaker 1: Each game is basically three games like the.

300
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:07,014
Speaker 1: if you pick fighter thief or wizard There's completely different things you can do like completely different stories.

301
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,800
Speaker 0: You change classes when you switch games.

302
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:16,200
Speaker 1: Uh, yes, but more importantly if you beat any of the games as a fight I can play one is wizard and play two is fighter.

303
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,866
Speaker 0: Transferring my character over.

304
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:21,666
Speaker 1: my favorite way to go is I'd start press for glory one as a thief But I you can.

305
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:21,988
Speaker 1: you have.

306
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:22,371
Speaker 1: you've set.

307
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:23,076
Speaker 1: you had skill points.

308
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:28,920
Speaker 1: in the beginning I gave myself magic like I open skills that you can open them at character creation, but not during the game.

309
00:22:29,322 --> 00:22:35,736
Speaker 1: So I gave myself magic and some fighting skills so I could do everything And I just leveled myself up along the way.

310
00:22:35,797 --> 00:22:36,240
Speaker 1: it took longer.

311
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,799
Speaker 1: I had to grind a little bit but I could literally do anything so I could do the thief quest But cast the open spell instead of picking the lock.

312
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Speaker 1: Okay, but if you beat the game as a fighter You had the option to go through a trial in each of the games to become a paladin.

313
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:54,299
Speaker 1: See I had to play at least two of the games to be able to be the fourth class.

314
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:10,340
Speaker 0: Okay, these games are just like very different from all the other adventure games from that era like those scum games or Well, I guess I think they combined the sort of RPG freedom of like a Baldur's Gate or a JRPG.

315
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but along with the point-and-click adventure puzzle solving of a monkey's island.

316
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:19,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, because a monkey island like there's one solution to the puzzle like those kinds of literally just a puzzle.

317
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,338
Speaker 0: This is puzzle plus RPG sort of like a step building visual novel kind of situation.

318
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:25,900
Speaker 0: exactly.

319
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:31,419
Speaker 1: It's a relatively unexplored genre still because not many games like it have ever been made even now.

320
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:33,088
Speaker 0: Well a lot of the step building.

321
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:35,020
Speaker 0: visual novels are straight-up visual novel.

322
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,267
Speaker 0: They don't have the.

323
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,780
Speaker 0: you know the point-and-click kind of thing exactly.

324
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:42,969
Speaker 1: So some blast little news Death Stranding.

325
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:48,538
Speaker 1: if you needed a reason to not have to buy a Playstation It's just on Steam now, you can just play it on a PC.

326
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:53,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyone who bought some console just to play some Hideo Kojima game well look at that.

327
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,417
Speaker 0: You could have just waited until today or what I got.

328
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:56,720
Speaker 0: I guess it.

329
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,293
Speaker 0: I don't know if today was the day or if it was yesterday or what it was recent.

330
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:02,268
Speaker 1: cuz people I saw I forgot This game cuz I wanted to play.

331
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:02,911
Speaker 0: it's like well.

332
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:03,855
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

333
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:04,498
Speaker 0: you know this.

334
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,967
Speaker 0: This you know I understand this.

335
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:10,920
Speaker 0: exclusive games that people want to play all right, but there's so few of them.

336
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:16,280
Speaker 0: There's so few and if you just wait they eventually almost all make it to PC.

337
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,373
Speaker 0: And if they don't make it to PC you can emulate them eventually right it's like.

338
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:21,376
Speaker 0: so it's like.

339
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:27,980
Speaker 0: I don't see any Reason to buy a Playstation or Xbox right no matter.

340
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,421
Speaker 0: It's like.

341
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:33,556

342
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:37,939
Speaker 0: right it's like Okay, you don't need to play the game right now.

343
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:39,165
Speaker 0: You can wait and see.

344
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,575
Speaker 0: and if five ten years down the line.

345
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:42,660
Speaker 0: It still hasn't been ported.

346
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,644
Speaker 0: That's the only way to play it.

347
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:44,407
Speaker 0: well guess what now?

348
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:46,274

Speaker 0: You can play that game.

350
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:52,510
Speaker 0: No problem Why would you pay $500 whatever it cost to buy a PlayStation?

351
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:54,817
Speaker 0: because you need to play that game today immediately.

Speaker 0: Oh, I was not aware of that.

357
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,480

Speaker 0: oh yeah, so you know it's being at home, right?

377
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,500
Speaker 0: You know you get a lot more time to listen to music or whatever.

378
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:00,403
Speaker 0: So I've been.

379
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:06,000
Speaker 0: you know what I've been doing is not just you know eventually even Spotify you're right out of things to listen to Kind of right.

380
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:10,975
Speaker 0: so you know you go on twitch or whatever YouTube, and you know you find some DJs.

381
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:16,864
Speaker 0: and DJs are great because DJs are people who know a lot of music and They just play it.

382
00:26:16,904 --> 00:26:19,780
Speaker 0: for you don't have to think you don't have to search you just push play.

383
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:22,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, you minimize them, and you're it's you get some great tune.

384
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:28,367
Speaker 1: I mean I've been doing that too just with like lo-fi beats or with There's a bunch of good future funk channels.

385
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:28,748
Speaker 1: that they're.

386
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:34,164
Speaker 0: they're semi live or they get you getting in the future fun game now Future funk.

387
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:37,060
Speaker 1: okay, I'm a little more fan of lo-fi beats.

388
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:41,990
Speaker 0: the point is You know just being a curious nerd.

389
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:44,739
Speaker 0: I've always been curious like hey You know all these DJs.

390
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:47,911
Speaker 0: They all have you know two or two tables and a microphone or they had.

391
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:54,360
Speaker 0: there was a time period where I know DJs recently Like Serato where they would have turntables, but it was like a magical digital record.

392
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:56,563
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were at Katsu count in the DJ I remember.

393
00:26:56,583 --> 00:27:00,205
Speaker 1: he was explaining to us how it worked and it was really cool And we both got really interested in it.

394
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:01,749
Speaker 0: nowadays people just have.

395
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:05,440
Speaker 0: nowadays people just have DJ controllers, which are just plastic.

396
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:09,959
Speaker 0: There's just basically you know beat mania Right and then the computer does all the work.

397
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,500
Speaker 0: But the you still have a controller that looks like two turntables and a microphone and a mixer right?

398
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:29,873
Speaker 0: And I've always wondered just curious like I have no plans to ever be a DJ right I know that that is not a road I will go down if I were to purchase even an inexpensive DJ thing from some other Aspiring failed DJ who bought the stuff and decided not to use it and sell it.

399
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:30,235
Speaker 0: that

400
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,643
Speaker 1: is the best way to get most audio Equipment by the way

401
00:27:32,804 --> 00:27:44,180
Speaker 0: that I would then also end up being the person that I purchased it from and be in selling it Right and not DJing anything, so I'm not going down that road, but I'm still curious How do you if you if I were to be DJ?

402
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:46,419
Speaker 0: How do you use that thing like what all those buttons do?

403
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,206
Speaker 0: What all those buttons do I?

404
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:53,157
Speaker 0: obviously I know that some of them do right just obvious I mean some of it's just a mixer like right.

405
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:54,347
Speaker 0: obviously I know all that.

406
00:27:54,387 --> 00:27:57,267
Speaker 0: you know a lot of the parts But it's like if you were to be a DJ.

407
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:59,416
Speaker 0: like what buttons do you press what?

408
00:27:59,476 --> 00:28:00,279
Speaker 0: how does it work right?

409
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:07,660
Speaker 0: So I went on YouTube and I tried to watch videos like how to DJ and a lot of the videos were crappy.

410
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,584
Speaker 0: Obviously right they were.

411
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:13,676
Speaker 0: they were the professors who were attempting to teach the way to DJ.

412
00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:15,000
Speaker 0: We're not doing a very good job.

413
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,653
Speaker 0: I was able to learn a bit, but they did not go into detail right.

414
00:28:18,693 --> 00:28:21,725
Speaker 0: I did not feel as if I've Learned how to do this.

415
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,529
Speaker 0: I could do it like.

416
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:28,580
Speaker 1: I feel like a lot of those people will say like Things like bead matching, but they never actually explain how the fuck you do that?

417
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:30,083
Speaker 0: Yeah They don't expect it.

418
00:28:30,203 --> 00:28:38,172
Speaker 0: really explain in detail not leaving anything out right not telling you exactly what each button did When you would use them and why right.

419
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:39,679
Speaker 0: and then I found this guy.

420
00:28:40,643 --> 00:28:42,830
Speaker 0: This YouTube channel is club ready DJ.

421
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:43,733
Speaker 0: I think right.

422
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:44,555
Speaker 0: and this guy.

423
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:45,859
Speaker 0: I don't know his name.

424
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:48,298
Speaker 1: He is selling his club ready DJ.

425
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,593
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's selling classes that he teaches you know so you could learn how to be.

426
00:28:53,873 --> 00:29:02,900
Speaker 0: his focus is on obviously getting people Not just to learn how to DJ But it's like be good enough at DJing that you can go and work in the club right because that's the way to get good.

427
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,408
Speaker 1: Get low to your gigs in the area like that right.

428
00:29:05,428 --> 00:29:05,870
Speaker 0: so you're.

429
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:14,500
Speaker 0: so his lesson plan is get you ready to go to the Club just like his name club ready DJ, and he sells classes that will help you learn this.

430
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:19,380
Speaker 0: But he has this YouTube channel, and I feel like wow this YouTube channel is so good.

431
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:21,990
Speaker 0: Why would you pay for the classes you learned?

432
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,120
Speaker 0: I learned everything for these free YouTube videos.

433
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:30,478
Speaker 0: Right and it's like these are the best DJ teaching videos, and I still have no plans to DJ.

434
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:45,239
Speaker 0: But now I feel like if I were had a gun to my head and someone threw a DJ controller in front of me Right that I would remember this guy, and he taught me well enough in a YouTube video so good at teaching That I could maybe not get shot.

435
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:53,180
Speaker 0: So if you are interested in DJing or are just curious how DJ stuff works like I was this is a great YouTube channel.

436
00:29:54,043 --> 00:30:05,051
Speaker 0: Club ready DJ is an excellent YouTube teacher And if you want to teach something else and you want to make other instructional YouTube videos about some other topic You should learn from club ready DJ.

437
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,200
Speaker 0: I had to do that because he's great.

438
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:10,615
Speaker 1: All right, so y'all familiar with Rocket League.

439
00:30:10,635 --> 00:30:11,419
Speaker 1: It's popular game.

440
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:13,524
Speaker 0: It's still alive.

441
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:14,367
Speaker 0: people still play it.

442
00:30:14,427 --> 00:30:17,980
Speaker 1: from what I gather just I had some unrelated conversation with people.

443
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:25,732
Speaker 1: It seems to be pretty well agreed that Rocket League might have the most toxic player community on earth Apparently people I mean.

444
00:30:25,752 --> 00:30:28,405
Speaker 0: when I played it it Sort of I mean it.

445
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:34,680
Speaker 0: there was toxicity when I played it when it was new in its first year of You know competitive play or whatever.

446
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:39,900
Speaker 0: But the toxicity mostly came at least when I was playing it.

447
00:30:40,903 --> 00:30:42,731
Speaker 1: Who thought they were good, but they weren't right.

448
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:44,196
Speaker 0: yeah, or like you know.

449
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:48,070
Speaker 0: it's like yeah You'd be stuck in these low tier matches, and that'd be like some.

450
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:50,539
Speaker 0: you know the typical stuff right.

451
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,692
Speaker 1: oh I'm not bronze here I'm not brought here.

452
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:54,320
Speaker 1: as he descended

453
00:30:54,561 --> 00:31:09,420
Speaker 0: I was I was under I was under the impression that over time since the game isn't so new anymore the only people still playing It which are still a lot of people right Where people who really cared about it and were good at it right and all the other people had sort of left for other games.

454
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:19,871
Speaker 0: And thus I had believed perhaps falsely the toxicity had decreased because it was pretty much like yeah The only people still playing Rocket League are pros who care about Rocket League.

455
00:31:20,252 --> 00:31:20,613
Speaker 1: course you know.

456
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:31,619
Speaker 1: it's interesting if that happened though I don't know how Rocket League's tearing works, but in most like matchmaking tearing It's based more on a curve so that if it's all great players someone's still gonna be bronzed here.

457
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:34,206
Speaker 0: Maybe who knows.

458
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:57,119
Speaker 1: but anyway Rocket League Kind of already existed a long long time ago, and I have this video that is people in 1927 driving early shitty little cars that look kind of like Rocket League cars Driving around pushing a giant ball literally just playing Rocket League with real cars.

459
00:31:58,161 --> 00:32:04,780
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm it was push ball was a game that people were playing and in fact people still play today.

460
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:10,940
Speaker 1: I found a website with a bunch of photos of a group that plays push ball with cars like this today.

461
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,452
Speaker 0: Okay, like RC cars or no full-size cars.

462
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:25,020
Speaker 1: They're in these full-size really old looking cars Driving it around in a field model T. Yeah like model T. Looking cars with little cages around them, but no one's playing.

463
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,949
Speaker 0: They don't know it's doing it with like Toyota Corolla or whatever.

464
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:28,791
Speaker 1: that would be great.

465
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:39,080
Speaker 1: these do not look safe at all Okay, and they're driving them around at speed just trying to ram this ball into a net on either side of a field.

466
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,054
Speaker 0: I guess they don't have rockets though.

467
00:32:41,134 --> 00:32:41,799
Speaker 0: They don't have rockets.

468
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:49,871
Speaker 1: No, I don't know what happens if you kill the other player because I know Rocket League has rules about that but there's video from people in 19 from 1927 people playing this.

469
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:56,714
Speaker 1: I Have to imagine that at least four people died anytime this game got played.

470
00:32:56,794 --> 00:33:03,671
Speaker 1: this does not look cool Okay, but the reason I found this video is almost more fascinating.

471
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:14,327
Speaker 1: someone tweeted something and it was talking about sports being played like a hundred years ago, and it mentioned horse push ball and I was like what's horse push ball see now.

472
00:33:14,428 --> 00:33:22,100
Speaker 0: so now this is interesting that you mentioned horse push ball because I Imagine that if there's a horse version of a sport the car version came later.

473
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,178
Speaker 0: Yeah So why is why would it be?

474
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,945
Speaker 0: Pushball and horse push ball?

475
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:33,548
Speaker 0: if there was a horse version shouldn't have the horse version be push ball and the car version would be car Push ball, so I went even deeper.

476
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:38,779
Speaker 1: the original game was just push ball in the late 1800s And it was humans imagine soccer.

477
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:46,119
Speaker 1: But there's one giant ball that's taller than any human and people just fucking have a fistfight over it until they push it into one of the goals.

478
00:33:47,021 --> 00:33:48,348
Speaker 0: Alright, that's a sport.

479
00:33:48,388 --> 00:33:49,152
Speaker 1: It's a real thing.

480
00:33:49,313 --> 00:33:50,599
Speaker 1: It was popular.

481
00:33:51,500 --> 00:34:15,737
Speaker 1: Apparently Yale University had their own variant called bladder ball Which was such a problem on campus that the police got involved and riots occurred on a regular basis Where basically every now and then someone would bring out the bladder this giant beach ball looking thing And then the students will just riot over like trying to steal it and push it into their own dorm or whatever like it was a thing.

482
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:18,268
Speaker 1: So yeah push ball was a human sport.

483
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:25,277
Speaker 1: people started playing it with horses Which does not look super safe, and then they started playing it in the 20s and 30s with cars.

484
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:30,380
Speaker 1: It seems like today the human version and the car version are the only versions that are still played.

485
00:34:31,681 --> 00:34:32,666
Speaker 0: That's probably for the best.

486
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:35,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz the horse version looks.

487
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:39,695
Speaker 1: I don't know how well they cared for the horses, but I worry a little bit about it.

488
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:42,621
Speaker 1: based on some of the footage I found Mmm.

489
00:34:43,024 --> 00:34:46,295
Speaker 0: I do not ever want to worry about any animal in usage in sports.

490
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:47,199
Speaker 1: Yeah pretty much.

491
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:54,938
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you want to go play push ball It looks like there are people who are more than willing to endanger you for that purpose.

492
00:34:56,983 --> 00:34:57,826
Speaker 1: Okay in the meta moment.

493
00:34:58,528 --> 00:35:00,235
Speaker 1: We're stuck at home like we've been.

494
00:35:00,717 --> 00:35:01,640
Speaker 1: nothing's really changed.

495
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,320
Speaker 1: I don't really have a significant update since the last time we talked.

496
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, PAX online is the next convention.

497
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:20,819
Speaker 1: There will be no PAX's this year because the state of Pennsylvania basically said nothing's happening this year, so no PAX unplugged which Obviously there wasn't gonna be a PAX unplugged Yeah, but now it's official.

498
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, PAX unplugged hasn't said it's official, but the state of Pennsylvania has made the point moot, right?

499
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are no events for the next six months.

500
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:29,331
Speaker 0: Well.

501
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:32,608
Speaker 1: That's that and based on how things are going in, Texas I'm pretty I am not.

502
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:35,060
Speaker 1: I'm a hundred percent sure there will not be a PAX South.

503
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:36,965
Speaker 0: There won't be.

504
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:39,134
Speaker 0: there could be a magfest online.

505
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:40,078
Speaker 0: that might be interesting.

506
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,182
Speaker 1: yeah We'll see.

507
00:35:41,423 --> 00:35:52,961
Speaker 0: maybe some maybe some other conventions that we have not gone to because There were you know physical this I think online Connecticut like already just happened like a tank came too quick for me to get ready for It.

508
00:35:53,724 --> 00:35:57,080
Speaker 0: yeah, I don't know how many people watched it even a lot of online cops.

509
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,240
Speaker 1: They're not getting a lot of traction.

510
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:10,083
Speaker 1: But there's a few that are coming together that look like they're gonna put on a good show that we're gonna be at PAX online Virtual packs and we're gonna be at the virtual crunchyroll expo And we're trying to figure out what other online cons We want to do.

511
00:36:10,444 --> 00:36:14,119
Speaker 1: if there is a virtual con that you want us at like email us.

512
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:15,021
Speaker 1: Like.

513
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:15,603
Speaker 1: email me.

514
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:21,660
Speaker 1: remember for recruit calm because I'm actively currently sorting out our virtual convention schedule for the rest of the year.

515
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:29,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, also in terms of online cons That I will attend but not be a speaker just be an attendee all right.

516
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:31,485
Speaker 1: Sing game devs of color.

517
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:34,033
Speaker 0: yeah the game devs of color is going online.

518
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:36,060
Speaker 0: They're usually in the summer around this time.

519
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,595
Speaker 0: I think if it was still scheduled submissions closed relatively recently.

520
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:42,160
Speaker 1: you press on me tweeting about it a whole bunch.

521
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:45,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it was like if there hasn't been a pandemic.

522
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:47,980
Speaker 0: it would have been like last week or a couple weeks ago.

523
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:52,440
Speaker 0: It would have been recent right or it would have been very close to this time.

524
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,540
Speaker 0: But I think they're making it in September or something the online version.

525
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,893
Speaker 1: I'm trying to fight because the Google likes to point at their old website here.

526
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:01,916
Speaker 1: We are 2020 expo September 19th online.

527
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,155
Speaker 0: Right.

528
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:06,849
Speaker 0: so yeah It's gonna be around isn't that close to packs online time?

529
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:09,480
Speaker 1: it is close to packs online and also close to crunchyroll expo.

530
00:37:09,621 --> 00:37:10,508
Speaker 1: Everyone's doing September.

531
00:37:11,073 --> 00:37:13,846
Speaker 1: That's all right I don't know yet as far as I can see.

532
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:19,865
Speaker 0: of course you also mentioned as GDQ which is gonna be August some yep But it's also been devs of color.

533
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:23,033
Speaker 1: expo is notable in that the way every time we've gone.

534
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:25,420
Speaker 1: the panel content is fantastic.

535
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:30,949
Speaker 0: I mean in terms of the Quality to quantity ratio of panel content.

536
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,480
Speaker 0: I'd say it is probably the best of any con period.

537
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:36,420
Speaker 1: It's better than packs in terms of quality.

538
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:39,780
Speaker 0: Even if you go to magfest right we have like your mages content.

539
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:44,614
Speaker 0: You've got it diluted by so much You know not all the other not all not all the non mages.

540
00:37:44,654 --> 00:37:48,563
Speaker 0: content at magfest is meh Yeah, this is a mess stuff But it's not come.

541
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:54,120
Speaker 1: but like these the talks at gdoc tend to be like the a-tier talks you see from other gaming cons.

542
00:37:54,261 --> 00:37:57,097
Speaker 0: Exactly right whereas you know you go to say packs.

543
00:37:57,157 --> 00:38:04,480
Speaker 0: It's like yeah There's a lot of industry garbage filling up the schedule all right, but game devs of color expo literally every talk is terrific.

544
00:38:05,003 --> 00:38:06,007
Speaker 0: That's the whole schedule.

545
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:07,133
Speaker 0: There's like nothing to skip.

546
00:38:07,153 --> 00:38:08,359
Speaker 0: you could just sit in there all day.

547
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:10,769
Speaker 0: Just the one two panel rooms.

548
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:11,392
Speaker 0: Just sit there.

549
00:38:11,553 --> 00:38:15,509
Speaker 1: You don't got to do nothing else Alright, so I think we should get right into it.

550
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:19,955
Speaker 1: modding consoles is a thing Less of a thing for us than it used to be.

551
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:23,100
Speaker 1: at least it was Something that I didn't think I'd ever revisit again in my life.

552
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:26,228
Speaker 1: But as Scott's gonna talk about now.

553
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:32,866
Speaker 1: We have a lot of old gaming hardware that can actually just be made better With modern technology.

554
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:39,168
Speaker 0: so someone posted you know cold guy posted in our forum listener cold guy And he posted this video.

555
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:40,855
Speaker 0: we could link to the video.

556
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:41,779
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I'll pull it up.

557
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:46,564
Speaker 0: I think the video was an advertisement in disguise, but I guess it worked Recognized.

558
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:54,740
Speaker 0: I recognized it was an advertisement But basically they took it was about upgrading a Gameboy Advance right.

559
00:38:55,442 --> 00:39:14,549
Speaker 0: Someone who makes Gameboy Advance retro modding products right sent all their products to this guy who has a YouTube channel And he made the YouTube guy made a video about upgrading his Gameboy Advance with all the products, and I said wow that's amazing I would like to do that as well, so I purchased all the same exact products And I upgraded my Gameboy.

560
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:16,700
Speaker 0: I had a Gameboy Advance sitting there unused.

561
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:18,927
Speaker 0: It's my original Gameboy Advance the very.

562
00:39:19,168 --> 00:39:22,859
Speaker 0: I bought it on release day, but now it is no more it is now.

563
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:38,920
Speaker 0: It's motherboard has now been inserted into this other case right with a different screen attached and The battery is changed and a tiny tiny amplifier has been placed in between the motherboard and a replacement speaker.

564
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:39,907
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, didn't you put?

565
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:41,518
Speaker 1: did you put the his filter in it, too?

566
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,279
Speaker 0: There's no real hissing noises.

567
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like this is something that only all like some people really care about it and no one else.

568
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,884
Speaker 0: No, I haven't really.

569
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:53,029
Speaker 0: I haven't really heard in.

570
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,073
Speaker 0: the audio is just.

571
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:55,560
Speaker 0: it sounds loud, and it sounds great.

572
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:56,183
Speaker 0: So I don't really.

573
00:39:56,203 --> 00:39:57,691
Speaker 0: I haven't actually have to try the headphone hole.

574
00:39:57,832 --> 00:39:59,280
Speaker 0: I'll do that after the show probably.

575
00:39:59,922 --> 00:40:04,280
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like I upgraded this Gameboy Advance to now the screen is an IPS screen.

576
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:10,440
Speaker 0: It's like any we're talking a screen as good as not a retina screen, but like think of an iPhone pre retina.

577
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:13,391
Speaker 0: That's the kind of screen that this Gameboy Advance has right.

578
00:40:13,772 --> 00:40:16,000
Speaker 0: the brightness and the colors are just outstanding.

579
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:19,065
Speaker 0: You can actually control the brightness Which you couldn't do right.

580
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:22,877
Speaker 0: the volume because of the amplifier can go way louder out of the speaker.

581
00:40:22,998 --> 00:40:23,519
Speaker 0: Which is great.

582
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:32,779
Speaker 0: And the battery has been replaced a rechargeable lithium ion battery with USB C. So no more double A's Just plug it into the wall.

583
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:34,605
Speaker 1: That's pretty exciting that part.

584
00:40:35,026 --> 00:40:36,511
Speaker 0: and it's like it's a Gameboy Advance.

585
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:46,924
Speaker 0: so it can play GBA games and Gameboy color games and Gameboy Games, and if you get a flash cart, you know it can also play like NES games with an emulator Flash card.

586
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,673
Speaker 1: that everyone's just backing up games not pirating them.

587
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:50,395
Speaker 1: Just backing them up.

588
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:51,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

589
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:55,474
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's like I had a DS light.

590
00:40:55,555 --> 00:41:02,155
Speaker 0: and a DS light You know has a backlit screen has two screens and that can also play with a flash cart.

591
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:08,199
Speaker 0: right you know Gameboy Gameboy color NES and GBA games and DS games.

592
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:12,652
Speaker 0: Obviously this could do everything that the DS light can do except the DS games.

593
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:18,059
Speaker 0: right and the DS light could do SNES games and sort of Genesis games.

594
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:20,928
Speaker 0: But the resolution of the screen was too low.

595
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:24,860
Speaker 0: so it would like it would either stretch or cut off part of the SNES games.

596
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:39,454
Speaker 0: It wasn't great, and you know a DS has two screens But one screen of a DS is where you'd be playing most of these games and those screens would be One DS screen is smaller than one GBA screen physically right and the form factor is not as great.

597
00:41:39,494 --> 00:41:44,899
Speaker 0: so like this upgraded GBA is Actually other than not being able to play DS games.

598
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:49,497
Speaker 0: Yeah, Super Nintendo games is like the best handheld right.

599
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:50,341
Speaker 0: it's like a mate You know.

600
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,330
Speaker 0: incredible right and if I could play it.

601
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:58,839
Speaker 0: if there's a game that I could play on this I'd rather play it on this than on a DS or through even 3ds if right.

602
00:42:00,923 --> 00:42:02,252
Speaker 0: So that's pretty awesome, and you know.

603
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:03,500
Speaker 0: so I had to do some electronics.

604
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,620
Speaker 0: You know soldering and whatnot, but it was actually very forgiving right?

605
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:16,140
Speaker 0: I did a real shitty job of soldering and it still worked perfectly on the first try And also I didn't need to need to do the soldering right if you don't want the amplifier.

606
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,707
Speaker 0: That's actually the hardest part.

607
00:42:18,129 --> 00:42:21,645
Speaker 0: you don't have to solder that you could just not do the amplifier Just keep the speaker.

608
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:24,380
Speaker 0: that came with the GBA the upgraded screen.

609
00:42:24,781 --> 00:42:29,020
Speaker 0: You don't have to do any soldering unless you want the brightness controls, which is just three wires.

610
00:42:29,123 --> 00:42:35,700
Speaker 0: It was very easy You know and putting it into the case the battery doesn't require any soldering at all.

611
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:39,620
Speaker 0: And putting it into the case is actually the hardest part.

612
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:47,113
Speaker 0: It's just a matter of screwdriver right, but it was a little tricky to get all the buttons and stuff You know lined up, especially the L&R buttons.

613
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:51,731
Speaker 0: They were a huge pain in the ass All right, but I did manage it and now I'm never opening this again.

614
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:56,006
Speaker 0: Yep, if it breaks well Well, it's funny.

615
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:57,820
Speaker 1: that's one difference between like mod.

616
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,281
Speaker 1: There's like.

617
00:42:58,883 --> 00:43:17,720
Speaker 1: there's different levels of risk for modding because when I was really young we had a game gear and there was a mod That I'd read about on a BBS that people had talked about Where you would futz with the way the batteries work to give it a lot longer battery life Something to do with the fact that the LCD Only used like one or two of the batteries and all the rest of the batteries powered the rest of the machine.

618
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:23,840
Speaker 1: But the LCD batteries would burn out the fastest because of that backlight because that was ancient LCD technology.

619
00:43:24,488 --> 00:43:24,720
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

620
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:31,159
Speaker 1: And there was a mod of like soldering and moving stuff around to get to put more batteries in just for the LCD.

621
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:40,438
Speaker 1: And if you did it that if you did that the whole thing would last like five or six hours on one set of batteries instead of like one or two, but I was a kid.

622
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:44,088
Speaker 1: I Theoretically could have made this mod based on these instructions.

623
00:43:44,148 --> 00:43:46,275
Speaker 1: I downloaded from a BBS that I dialed into.

624
00:43:46,535 --> 00:43:59,460
Speaker 1: however, I Could not afford to buy a new game gear if I fucked it up And if I told my parents that I cracked open the game gear and took a soldering iron to it and now it's broken They definitely would not have bought me a new one.

625
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:06,660
Speaker 1: The risk was so high compared to the reward that I was willing to just keep buying double-a batteries my entire childhood.

626
00:44:07,621 --> 00:44:19,896
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean what it comes down to is, you know, we have these pieces of hardware right computers game consoles, right and Even though time has gone on it's right is it's you know?

627
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:23,606
Speaker 0: newer hardware Doesn't run that old software.

628
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:27,736
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you later get this but they're not perfect.

629
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:29,019
Speaker 0: No, they're not.

630
00:44:30,562 --> 00:44:34,136
Speaker 0: And there are like clone consoles you can get which are pretty cool.

631
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:35,240
Speaker 0: right that exists.

632
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,905
Speaker 0: But even so it's like okay.

633
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:42,476
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna buy basically a modern NES clone machine, right?

634
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:43,980
Speaker 0: It's like I have an NES right here.

635
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:45,579
Speaker 0: Why would I do that, right?

636
00:44:46,782 --> 00:44:49,257
Speaker 0: It's like hey this NES is still perfectly good, right?

637
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,940
Speaker 0: But the problem is I can't hook it up to my TV because it doesn't have HDMI, right?

638
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:54,882
Speaker 0: Well, guess what?

639
00:44:55,304 --> 00:44:58,500
Speaker 0: We have people make things so you can add HDMI to an NES.

640
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:00,969
Speaker 0: Why not go for it, right?

641
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:04,281
Speaker 0: You know, it's like oh you got a Commodore 64.

642
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:06,027
Speaker 0: Add HDMI output to it.

643
00:45:06,047 --> 00:45:09,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know some kind of audio output that is easier to use.

644
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:16,986
Speaker 1: Well, you know speaking of the cold guy again way back Pat actually gave me and the Atari 2600 with the Video out mod.

645
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:17,488
Speaker 1: So it doesn't.

646
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,733
Speaker 0: yes the s-video out.

647
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:21,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it doesn't need RF Anything.

648
00:45:22,184 --> 00:45:30,980
Speaker 1: so to this day like well, I guess now I can't have a party But we occasionally just turn on the 2600 and play outlaw on a modern TV with the actual hardware.

649
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:34,493
Speaker 0: Right when these things were new they were state-of-the-art technology.

650
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:36,440
Speaker 0: There was no upgrading to be done to it, right?

651
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,080
Speaker 0: It's like what are you gonna upgrade on your Nintendo switch, right?

652
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:47,052
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like people change the plastic shells on them and stuff like that Like the old the original Game Boy, you can't see that screen for shit.

653
00:45:47,754 --> 00:45:48,977
Speaker 1: No backlight in there.

654
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:49,799
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

655
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,600
Speaker 1: No, that's why it lasted so long compared to the game gear.

656
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:55,832
Speaker 0: Right, but it's like there's nothing to upgrade on a switch.

657
00:45:55,852 --> 00:45:57,400
Speaker 0: You could just you could style it, right?

658
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,212
Speaker 0: You could maybe make controllers that are that are better if you need.

659
00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:03,700
Speaker 0: maybe accessibility reasons or comfort reasons.

660
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,104
Speaker 1: Most people see style reasons.

661
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:07,653
Speaker 1: Most people seem to do on their switches cosmetic mods, like.

662
00:46:07,673 --> 00:46:09,860
Speaker 1: they'll get custom controllers that look cool.

663
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:15,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you want to go out and say upgrade the screen on your switch It's like what screen are you gonna get?

664
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:17,015
Speaker 0: There's no better screen.

665
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:17,878
Speaker 0: You can go buy.

666
00:46:17,898 --> 00:46:20,446
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not like there's nothing that it's using.

667
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,575
Speaker 0: the best screen available for a Nintendo switch is already in the switch.

668
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,300
Speaker 0: right HDMI output.

669
00:46:25,401 --> 00:46:26,728
Speaker 0: It's like it has HDMI output.

670
00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:27,634
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do to it?

671
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:28,680
Speaker 0: It's like come on.

672
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:36,880
Speaker 0: But these older consoles not only can you upgrade a lot of especially the input output parts of them, right?

673
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:43,999
Speaker 0: You don't really you know You can also Was I said the input output parts.

674
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:45,985
Speaker 0: Yeah I are definitely the inter.

675
00:46:46,005 --> 00:46:52,033
Speaker 1: you can also solve problems that were caused by the limitations of the state-of-the-art Technology of the time like the game gear.

676
00:46:52,315 --> 00:46:56,074
Speaker 1: I've seen some mods But they seem a lot harder to pull off because that's older hardware.

677
00:46:56,134 --> 00:46:57,260
Speaker 1: like way older hardware.

678
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:01,815
Speaker 1: You can replace the LCD with a new modern LCD display.

679
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:03,260
Speaker 1: that just works way better

680
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:18,759
Speaker 0: Yep, but what I was trying to say was Not only can you upgrade you know the input output parts with more modern stuff But when that technology was new when a game boy was new right if you opened it up That was actually complicated shit in there for the day.

681
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,162
Speaker 0: right.

682
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:25,926
Speaker 0: nowadays you open up a game boy and It's the inside is pedestrian.

683
00:47:25,966 --> 00:47:30,560
Speaker 1: It's like you can look at the board and like see the traces and understand what's going on.

684
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,499
Speaker 1: There's not right.

685
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:37,034
Speaker 0: It's like it's not actually a complicated piece of electronics like when I open up this GBA.

686
00:47:37,194 --> 00:47:45,259
Speaker 0: even the inside looked like an Electronics other than a few CPUs that had like you know some tiny surface mount stuff that like a machine might have to do.

687
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,129
Speaker 0: It's like the vast majority of the motherboard was like.

688
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:53,857
Speaker 0: oh that looks like an electronics project kit that I would do You know buy online and do for fun, right?

689
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:00,278
Speaker 1: You know the funniest was when I the only the console I modded first in my life when I actually was willing to do it was that ps1.

690
00:48:00,882 --> 00:48:03,273
Speaker 1: I bought a ps1 and I want to put a mod chip in it.

691
00:48:03,595 --> 00:48:04,660
Speaker 1: I remember I cracked it open.

692
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:07,020
Speaker 1: I was so worried like how I'm gonna get this mod chip in here.

693
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:21,300
Speaker 1: What if I fuck it up, but when I actually cracked it open, you know who's in there just like one really cheap looking green like but breadboard With some like really shoddy looking solders on it and a bunch of solid-state components and chips.

694
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:21,882
Speaker 1: And that was it.

695
00:48:21,943 --> 00:48:23,670
Speaker 1: like it was just one little board.

696
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,880
Speaker 1: It was so simple that I almost laughed.

697
00:48:26,602 --> 00:48:34,025
Speaker 0: Right, it's like the older stuff is simple enough to be worked on by an amateur, you know Hobbyist at home.

698
00:48:34,467 --> 00:48:35,390
Speaker 0: right the new stuff.

699
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:36,553
Speaker 0: It's like a piece.

700
00:48:36,593 --> 00:48:38,680
Speaker 0: I guess even you know PC motherboards.

701
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,159
Speaker 0: I guess even pretty much any x86 motherboard is too complicated to mess.

702
00:48:43,179 --> 00:48:47,212
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm not gonna solder anything to my motherboard to overclock though.

703
00:48:47,513 --> 00:48:53,380
Speaker 1: There were things people would do Along those lines to overclock chips back in the day, right?

704
00:48:53,862 --> 00:49:00,042
Speaker 1: But I think the combination drawing the contact trace to remove the FSB limiter on an Athlon Yep.

705
00:49:00,403 --> 00:49:06,238
Speaker 0: Yeah a combination of you know, the simplicity of the older devices relative to modern times, right.

706
00:49:06,258 --> 00:49:14,132
Speaker 0: the the possibility of upgrading due to availability of superior components Right and also financially right.

707
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:22,844
Speaker 0: you can buy a pile of broken GBAs Right, like how many I bet you could go on eBay and probably buy GBAs with broken screens Right, oh, yeah cheap.

708
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:31,214
Speaker 0: deploy these mods and then just resell them and then just replace the screens on it with brand new amazing screens That you bought right and it's like, you know, it's actually.

709
00:49:31,255 --> 00:49:33,705
Speaker 0: it's not that cheap though That's the thing you have to understand right?

710
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:37,960
Speaker 0: It's like okay, you know, you're buying a brand new amazing IPS screen.

711
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,926
Speaker 0: It's like that's not a cheap thing.

712
00:49:39,946 --> 00:49:43,235
Speaker 0: It's like it's a brand new awesome part, right?

713
00:49:43,717 --> 00:49:44,780
Speaker 0: So it's like the upgrading.

714
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:49,500
Speaker 0: It's not necessarily inexpensive You know, but it totally it totally works.

715
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:54,580
Speaker 1: What's cool is it can preserve some aspects of the experience of using old technology?

716
00:49:54,901 --> 00:50:00,320
Speaker 1: Well at the same time modernizing or discarding some of the more negative aspects of that old technology.

717
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:09,260
Speaker 0: So it's still true to the game, but like the experience is better Yeah, we don't have to use a little worm lights on our GBAs, right if we all get awesome screens in them.

718
00:50:09,643 --> 00:50:11,740
Speaker 1: I remember trying to play multi don't have to have batteries.

719
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:19,239
Speaker 1: I had the worm light and then I had the link cable plugged into the back of the worm light and it You'd even looked at it the wrong way the game would crash.

720
00:50:19,701 --> 00:50:23,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't have to have batteries dying because I put a lithium-ion battery in the double-a slot.

721
00:50:23,978 --> 00:50:26,127
Speaker 0: Yeah All that kind of stuff.

722
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:29,726
Speaker 1: now that PlayStation mod I'm gonna admit fully at.

723
00:50:29,746 --> 00:50:38,440
Speaker 0: the sole reason I put that PlayStation mod in was to pirate games like yeah See, that's the thing where I see even though the PlayStation at the time was a brand new PlayStation, right?

724
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,180
Speaker 0: Something that and it was you know, a modern technology at the time.

725
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,532
Speaker 0: I guess it was somewhat modern cuz ps2 was out already.

726
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:44,898
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the ps1.

727
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,140
Speaker 1: So it was the re-release of the original PlayStation with the small form factor, right?

728
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,527
Speaker 0: But you know still that wasn't.

729
00:50:51,728 --> 00:50:54,819
Speaker 0: as you know, you don't want a mod at the day at the time.

730
00:50:54,879 --> 00:51:00,340
Speaker 0: nowadays You'd be like whatever right but back in the day modding that wasn't as careless as upgrading a GBA.

731
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,780
Speaker 0: Like if I broke this GBA, I'd be like, oh no, I'd buy another.

732
00:51:03,544 --> 00:51:05,272
Speaker 1: I could not have afforded to buy another one.

733
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:06,277
Speaker 1: I did not have money, right?

734
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,740
Speaker 0: I have friends with who have just have spare GBAs lying around unused just like I do.

735
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,433
Speaker 0: I could have gotten more GBAs probably for next to nothing.

736
00:51:13,835 --> 00:51:14,619
Speaker 0: right to try again.

737
00:51:15,403 --> 00:51:25,200
Speaker 0: But yeah messing up that ps1 would have been not great But it made economic sense because the piracy possibilities made up for the risk of the mod ship.

738
00:51:25,704 --> 00:51:27,840
Speaker 0: No, I remember my friend in high school.

739
00:51:28,181 --> 00:51:35,969
Speaker 0: He had a PlayStation one that with a mod ship that he put in there and he would go to blockbuster rent games Copy him with his two blank CDs.

740
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and then return him and he was getting played.

741
00:51:38,802 --> 00:51:45,000
Speaker 0: He basically had a huge binder in 1997 or 8 just like full of like hundreds of places.

742
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:54,700
Speaker 0: I knew a kid like that and that is partly why cuz he had a he was getting these games that cost 50 60 bucks For you know, three four dollars for a blockbuster rental.

743
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:56,225
Speaker 1: The thing is I'd never.

744
00:51:56,426 --> 00:52:00,820
Speaker 1: when I got the ps1 my sole actual goal was to play dance dance revolution.

745
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,011
Speaker 0: You know nothing else.

746
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:06,392
Speaker 1: I needed a mod chip Even if I didn't want to pirate them because they were not released in the US.

747
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:14,660
Speaker 1: so I had to get Japanese Games that were region locked on the ps1 the mod chip would have also removed the region locking.

748
00:52:15,071 --> 00:52:19,877
Speaker 1: however I then could not actually get a hold of legitimate copies of these games.

749
00:52:20,299 --> 00:52:22,112
Speaker 1: not just But I could.

750
00:52:22,132 --> 00:52:24,880
Speaker 0: yeah, they were very expensive even if you could find them.

751
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:34,150
Speaker 1: But right around then is when red octane came on the scene and did Netflix of PlayStation games and they had every international game.

752
00:52:34,532 --> 00:52:47,682
Speaker 1: so we signed up for an account and Every week a DDR game came I copied it like I ripped the ISO out I mailed it back that day and I just got as many games I could for one month and I canceled red octane Mm-hmm.

753
00:52:47,702 --> 00:52:54,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's there's whole scenes of people out there now who are modding Various consoles for various purposes, right?

754
00:52:54,673 --> 00:53:01,260
Speaker 0: There are people modding Consoles to help with speed running so they can like debug the console to see what's going on in there.

755
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

756
00:53:02,464 --> 00:53:06,942
Speaker 0: You've got people who are modding consoles for chiptunes purposes Right.

757
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:17,591
Speaker 0: so they can like, you know get their Gameboy to do better at you know Get some extra access to the synthesizer or whatever that kind of stuff You know, but basically that's just like people are getting.

758
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,740
Speaker 0: you know that the possibilities are out there.

759
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,873
Speaker 0: The stuff is available cheap and the technologies are available.

760
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:26,003
Speaker 0: Just like there's the the scene is Really cool.

761
00:53:26,525 --> 00:53:34,233
Speaker 0: And if you have any interest in electronics, it's like, you know Like your game consoles as if you're a nerd or like your number one.

762
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:36,060
Speaker 0: They're like top tier electronics, right?

763
00:53:36,261 --> 00:53:41,400
Speaker 0: So it's like you and you're doing like your little electronics projects right making like an LED blink.

764
00:53:41,824 --> 00:53:47,280
Speaker 0: It's like that's not very exciting Right, but like dude upgrading a GBA suddenly is like whoa.

765
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:54,080
Speaker 0: That's like a whole new world like you're take your wet straight from crappy hobbyist electronics project with your soldering iron.

766
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:59,160
Speaker 0: Oh, I made an accumulator Right, and then you start doing game console shit.

767
00:53:59,241 --> 00:54:02,544
Speaker 0: It's like now you can see you know The real the real biz.

768
00:54:02,665 --> 00:54:12,956
Speaker 1: but I also think right now is a golden age for this that will never come again because we're at this point where All the consoles before that came before us.

769
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:19,557
Speaker 1: not all of them But like many of them like up to like the Gameboys Gameboy advances some of the Playstations like up to the ps2.

770
00:54:19,758 --> 00:54:25,074
Speaker 1: maybe The electronics are simple enough for us to mess with pretty easily.

771
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:29,419
Speaker 1: the newer ones that are coming out I think are going to be a lot more difficult to mod effectively.

772
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:35,591
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that even when even when you know The switch is really old like.

773
00:54:35,652 --> 00:54:37,480
Speaker 1: I don't think we're gonna be modding the switch there.

774
00:54:37,681 --> 00:54:40,914
Speaker 0: I think even right even a 3ds right.

775
00:54:40,974 --> 00:54:46,167
Speaker 0: I think it's like okay on a 3ds You could probably swap out the screen, but you think about Right.

776
00:54:46,207 --> 00:54:48,240
Speaker 0: it's like you think about phones these days, right?

777
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,260
Speaker 0: It's like you know when it comes to cell phones cuz 3ds is about cell phone.

778
00:54:52,582 --> 00:55:02,591
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna mod my old palm Smartphone so I can write a Nintendo switch is definitely cell phone level tech right in terms of you know Miniaturization level right touch.

779
00:55:02,631 --> 00:55:03,537
Speaker 0: It's got a touchscreen.

780
00:55:03,557 --> 00:55:08,182
Speaker 0: You know whatever is that the Peripherals?

781
00:55:08,262 --> 00:55:09,164
Speaker 0: I think can still.

782
00:55:09,586 --> 00:55:19,508
Speaker 0: there's still things to be done there replacing screens and messing with the audio messing with the inputs Right and the outputs yeah, but I think it'll be more Preservation and less for upgrade.

783
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:25,150
Speaker 0: the actual motherboards themselves like to mess with a switch Motherboard to mess with an iPhone motherboard.

784
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:29,087
Speaker 0: like people can fix your screen on your iPhone They can replace the battery on your iPhone.

785
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:32,500
Speaker 0: you can put a different speaker, or you know fix the camera.

786
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:40,686
Speaker 0: Maybe on your iPhone you can maybe mess with that right, but it's like you know to actually mess with anything on the board It's like that is too much.

787
00:55:40,746 --> 00:55:45,742
Speaker 0: I think for anyone without some serious equipment and skills right It's.

788
00:55:45,863 --> 00:55:49,012
Speaker 0: you know you're better off just making a new phone Doing that.

789
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:49,660
Speaker 1: but it's like that.

790
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:59,580
Speaker 1: we're just in this sweet spot now of the price versus availability versus access versus risk of messing with like These earlier eras of consoles in cool fun ways.

791
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:15,580
Speaker 0: And I think what's actually gonna happen as time goes on right like I said the newer The newer devices 3ds kind of forward are too complicated to mess with in a significant way Right and they don't have these glaring flaws that need to be improved either right that the older devices have.

792
00:56:17,137 --> 00:56:26,477
Speaker 0: And What's gonna happen is even though now we can mod the old ones I think what will happen as time goes on is the old ones will become rarer Right they're gonna become rare and more expensive.

793
00:56:26,497 --> 00:56:34,408
Speaker 0: so right now You could go and load up on game boys game boy colors game boy advances right all this sort of stuff And mod to your hearts can imagine

794
00:56:34,448 --> 00:56:40,720
Speaker 1: being the person like 20 years from now Who rolls into like a mag fest and is like sets up the room of all right?

795
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,560
Speaker 1: Here's a room with 20 chairs and 20 of these ancient game boy advances that still work right?

796
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,643
Speaker 0: 20 years from now?

797
00:56:46,723 --> 00:56:52,039
Speaker 0: how hard will it unless Nintendo or someone decides to remake them right which I think you know.

798
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:55,375
Speaker 0: that though There will be right is like there's a lot of people remaking old.

799
00:56:55,757 --> 00:56:58,309
Speaker 0: like I said You know you can buy like clones of an NES of.

800
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:14,640
Speaker 0: you know a modern machine that plays NES cartridges right they make those, but you know to get an actual game boy 20 years from now I don't know how many how easy that'll be to get one right Considering it how many will be broken lost or modded right?

801
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:25,551
Speaker 0: So there are however people who are doing things such as like the raspberry like pi zero game boys Yeah, or basically you instead of buying it old game boy.

802
00:57:26,112 --> 00:57:29,284
Speaker 0: What you do is you get a raspberry pi zero Which it's a

803
00:57:29,304 --> 00:57:31,700
Speaker 1: lot like making a main cabinet, but making a main portable

804
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:40,960
Speaker 0: Exactly as you just make a game boy out of a different computer entirely with emulators on it right And that's also a road to go down.

805
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,886
Speaker 0: I don't think that will ever really go away.

806
00:57:43,307 --> 00:57:49,996
Speaker 0: that actually only become easier as smaller computers get faster and more powerful, so That's I think the alternative.

807
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:51,945
Speaker 1: yeah So now's the time.

808
00:57:51,985 --> 00:57:57,220
Speaker 1: if you want to like now is the time both because the pandemic and you're stuck inside and because of the availability.

809
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:06,020
Speaker 1: You'll want to try this out like do it now because much like PC overclocking The window where that made sense and was easy to do and worth it to do was pretty brief.

810
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:10,700
Speaker 0: And there's a lot if you're looking to not be creative and just sort of do existing stuff.

811
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:18,680
Speaker 0: There's lots of companies who are making all these upgrade products and selling them and making tricking people into making ads for them on their YouTube channels.

812
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:30,223
Speaker 1: but they come with like really good instructions like if you've never Soldered before like prac like poking some solder a little bit And then you probably be able to pull this off all over YouTube and all the websites that sell the products They want.

813
00:58:30,243 --> 00:58:30,565
Speaker 0: they're not?

814
00:58:30,585 --> 00:58:31,813
Speaker 0: they realize they can't sell it.

815
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:40,551
Speaker 0: you a screen Replacement for your GBA if they're not also giving you Instructions that make you feel like you're confident enough that you can install it yourself.

816
00:58:40,611 --> 00:58:46,872
Speaker 0: right so and some of them are selling pre-modded ones But they charge an arm and a leg for that as they should.

817
00:58:47,395 --> 00:58:48,560
Speaker 0: so go out there.

818
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,025
Speaker 0: And you know these companies.

819
00:58:50,085 --> 00:58:52,272
Speaker 0: they have very limited runs on these products.

820
00:58:52,593 --> 00:58:57,149
Speaker 0: It's like they'll make these things sell them They'll sell out then maybe they'll make some more.

821
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,253
Speaker 0: Maybe not right.

822
00:58:58,294 --> 00:58:59,920
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll something better will come out.

823
00:59:00,442 --> 00:59:05,885
Speaker 0: So you sort of have to stay on top of it and like order stuff as it becomes available And watch.

824
00:59:06,006 --> 00:59:06,812
Speaker 0: you know these companies.

825
00:59:06,832 --> 00:59:07,980
Speaker 0: I think they exist now.

826
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,980
Speaker 0: I think they're gonna eventually like the market for this stuff will go away.

827
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:14,089
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like you have to go.

828
00:59:14,129 --> 00:59:17,010
Speaker 0: if you want to be a customer of any of these companies you got to go Find them now.

829
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:21,030
Speaker 0: So yeah use your use your Google skills you can find them.

830
00:59:21,914 --> 00:59:22,978
Speaker 1: I think that's a fine show.

831
00:59:26,273 --> 00:59:28,810
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
