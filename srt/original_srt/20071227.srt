1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,625
Speaker 1: Well, it's that time again.

2
00:00:01,906 --> 00:00:06,140
Speaker 1: We way back at some point in the past did a week of questions.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,286
Speaker 1: You asked your questions, we answered them.

4
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:11,076
Speaker 1: And it went really well.

5
00:00:11,216 --> 00:00:12,320
Speaker 1: We got a lot of feedback.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,524
Speaker 1: People seemed to really enjoy that.

7
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:20,800
Speaker 1: But another interesting thing was that we got way more questions than we could answer in about an hour for every single day.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:31,614
Speaker 0: And rather than filter out some of the questions, we just decided to answer a lot of them at some point in the future and then save those up for other episodes.

9
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:35,747
Speaker 0: This way, answering questions is basically a piece of cake.

10
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:40,463
Speaker 0: So making more than one episode, hey, less work for us.

11
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:46,131
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, every time we appear on someone else's show or we get interviewed by anyone, it's super fun.

12
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:52,099
Speaker 1: And I guess basically our ulterior motive was we tricked all of you into interviewing us.

13
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:53,041
Speaker 0: Yep.

14
00:00:53,965 --> 00:01:02,380
Speaker 0: So, yeah, just so anyone knows, if this is the first time listening to Geek Nights, I don't know if you might be entertained by this episode, but it's not our typical format.

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:09,140
Speaker 0: Try listening to a different show and you will hear the news and the things of the day and all the other things we usually put in an episode when we don't cop out.

16
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:11,565
Speaker 1: This is totally a cop out.

17
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:14,654
Speaker 1: We're recording this on a very sad day.

18
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:17,944
Speaker 1: If you knew what night we were recording this.

19
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:25,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically we're just going to read these questions and then answer them in any way we feel like.

20
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:28,127
Speaker 0: We can also opt not to answer them or do whatever the hell we want.

21
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:33,975
Speaker 0: We're not going to give anyone credit for asking the questions, because if you ask the question, you know who you are.

22
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:37,638
Speaker 0: And if you didn't ask the question, you don't care who asked it because not you.

23
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:44,160
Speaker 1: So the only final thing I'll say is that we didn't look at these questions ahead of time.

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,215
Speaker 1: So we have no idea what's coming here and we have no sort of research ready.

25
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,861
Speaker 1: So here we go.

26
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:51,105
Speaker 0: As the first question.

27
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:51,687
Speaker 1: All right.

28
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,376
Speaker 1: You have a one shot time machine.

29
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:55,239
Speaker 1: Great.

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,027
Speaker 1: It will irreparably break once used.

31
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,592
Speaker 1: When will you go?

32
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:00,916
Speaker 1: If any time?

33
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:02,420
Speaker 0: now I got the answer.

34
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:03,767
Speaker 1: I have a very clever answer.

35
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:04,390
Speaker 0: I have the most.

36
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:06,179
Speaker 0: I have the same maybe the same answer as you.

37
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:07,323
Speaker 1: is your answer.

38
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:11,838
Speaker 1: I would go back in time exactly one year and win a million lotteries.

39
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:11,898
Speaker 1: No.

40
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,342
Speaker 1: OK.

41
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:14,084
Speaker 0: Is that your answer?

42
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:14,485
Speaker 0: Yes.

43
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,454
Speaker 0: My answer is go into the future to wear.

44
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:21,487
Speaker 0: non one shot time machines exist so I can get the hell back.

45
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,954
Speaker 0: Because if a one shot time machine is.

46
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:27,104
Speaker 0: Oh, that's fine.

47
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:28,392
Speaker 1: And how are you going to buy it?

48
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:29,659
Speaker 1: You don't have any future money.

49
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,084
Speaker 1: You don't have any space dollars.

50
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:37,647
Speaker 0: Well, no, I have this antique first ever one shot time machine I can sell to a museum.

51
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:38,512
Speaker 1: And you know what they'll say?

52
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:39,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got a million of these.

53
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:40,742
Speaker 1: Everyone had the same idea.

54
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:41,584
Speaker 1: Yeah.

55
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:43,369
Speaker 0: The four other hundred scots that showed up.

56
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:43,730
Speaker 0: But you know what?

57
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,643
Speaker 1: That would be horrible future.

58
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:56,167
Speaker 1: There is zero risk with my option, which is become infinitely wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.

59
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,444
Speaker 1: Be the count of Monte Cristo, but not have to engage in horrible revenge.

60
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:01,649
Speaker 0: I don't know.

61
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:22,628
Speaker 0: I guess I just feel like going to the future, even though there's a risk of a horrible future, the benefits, if it works out, are so much better than the boring known past, because most of the interesting interesting things in life are discovering previously unknown things or new experiences in the past holds far less new things than the future.

62
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:24,233
Speaker 1: Well, but the immediate.

63
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:29,497
Speaker 1: basically, instead of traveling through time, what you do is travel through money on the money scale.

64
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:38,917
Speaker 1: You become more money and then you can use that money to do great things in your normal life and you can hang out with yourself in the past and cause some sort of paradise.

65
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:42,455
Speaker 0: See all the money in the world doesn't help me if all the cell phones suck.

66
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:48,158
Speaker 0: If I go one hundred years in the future to when we have brain phones, I'll just get a normal job and a brain phone.

67
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,708
Speaker 0: I'll actually be better off because think about it.

68
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:56,650
Speaker 0: Us in this current time with our normal amount of money are just about.

69
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,671
Speaker 0: I mean, we're maybe not as comfortable as the Roman emperor was more comfortable than many wealthy Romans were.

70
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:09,817
Speaker 0: So going into the future, I could probably be have an average income, but live better than Bill Gates does now are.

71
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:12,286
Speaker 1: The only problem is that you don't have any resources.

72
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:14,696
Speaker 1: You'll basically be like a job.

73
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,533
Speaker 1: How you'll be like the Terminator when he came back in time, naked and alone.

74
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:20,683
Speaker 0: The Terminator did pretty well for himself.

75
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:21,004
Speaker 1: Yeah.

76
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:23,814
Speaker 1: After he killed that guy, I got to have a job.

77
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:25,340
Speaker 0: Your job is assassinating.

78
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,189
Speaker 0: My job would be guy from the past at the freak show.

79
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:28,851
Speaker 1: Clothes.

80
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:29,895
Speaker 1: Give them to me.

81
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,038
Speaker 0: Exactly.

82
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:32,101
Speaker 0: All right.

83
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:33,786
Speaker 1: So what do you think about this next question?

84
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:42,708
Speaker 0: Oh, what do I think about the next professional Korean Starcraft league?

85
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,777
Speaker 0: I guess if you really like Starcraft, it's cool.

86
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:53,022
Speaker 1: I foresee a future where video games are pretty much considered the same as sports are now in popular culture.

87
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:55,070
Speaker 1: I just foresee that being a long ways out.

88
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,451
Speaker 1: Yeah.

89
00:04:55,572 --> 00:05:00,467
Speaker 0: I like how they respect video games as a worthwhile endeavor.

90
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:08,251
Speaker 0: that and how they you know, they can show the video games can be a good spectator activity as well as a player activity.

91
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:13,549
Speaker 0: But personally, I'm just not interested in Starcraft or real time strategy games in general.

92
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:17,201
Speaker 0: So I'm not all into it, but I respect it.

93
00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:22,282
Speaker 1: I'm very interested in RTS is the problem is I don't think anyone has made a truly good one yet.

94
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:23,569
Speaker 0: That's that's what I mean.

95
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:23,931
Speaker 0: Yeah.

96
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:25,740
Speaker 1: Now you might say, oh, but such and such is good.

97
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,079
Speaker 1: And yeah, it is good, but it's not at that level where it would be something transcendent.

98
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:30,521
Speaker 1: It's not.

99
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:32,428
Speaker 1: RTS is of a long way to go.

100
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:43,787
Speaker 0: I think also personally, like, well, I do think there is some video games where spectating is awesome, as is verified by watching, like, you know, people, videos of people playing video games on YouTube.

101
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:44,429
Speaker 0: And it's awesome.

102
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,717
Speaker 0: I personally don't.

103
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:49,825
Speaker 0: I tried to watch like like a championship round.

104
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,470
Speaker 1: It was a Starcraft game.

105
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:59,575
Speaker 0: I watched like two Korean champions play Starcraft in the championship round on YouTube at some tournament.

106
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:02,468
Speaker 0: And I didn't get the hell what was going on at all.

107
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:03,573
Speaker 0: And it made no sense to me.

108
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:04,739
Speaker 0: And it was not interesting.

109
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,850
Speaker 0: But if I understood Starcraft, it might be a lot more interesting.

110
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:12,466
Speaker 1: Oh, you mentioned you do audio filters on your podcast.

111
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:13,831
Speaker 1: Which do you use?

112
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:17,685
Speaker 1: How does the script that you use to publish your podcast look like?

113
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:19,492
Speaker 0: That was how does it look?

114
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,121
Speaker 0: It doesn't have eyes, so it doesn't look like anything.

115
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:25,852
Speaker 0: It looks a lot like a car does not at all.

116
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:35,220
Speaker 1: It's it's funny that we got this question now, because, you see, up until about three nights ago, we recorded the show a certain way.

117
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:44,377
Speaker 1: And now that I have this brand new mixer and all this new equipment and I'm doing everything completely differently, I can answer this kind of briefly and vaguely.

118
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:49,841
Speaker 1: The thing is, every time people ask me this, I give an answer and then they say, no, but specifically, what settings do you use?

119
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:56,645
Speaker 1: So I have to preface this by saying that telling anyone what specific settings you use is not going to help anyone.

120
00:06:56,846 --> 00:07:03,471
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone's like, you know, they want to say, OK, they want us to tell them set this knob at one point five.

121
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:09,833
Speaker 0: Now said this knob at two point five, like there's some sort of magic setting where everything will sound great.

122
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:10,575
Speaker 0: Listen up.

123
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:19,009
Speaker 0: If there was some magic setting where you could I could tell you set this knob at this is knob at that and it'll sound great, then we wouldn't need the knobs.

124
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,716
Speaker 0: They would just sell a little box where audio crap audio comes in and great audio comes out and the knob settings already be set.

125
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:30,213
Speaker 0: The reason there are knobs is because everyone needs to put the knobs in a different place.

126
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:37,460
Speaker 0: So you need to learn what the knobs do and learn how to figure out where to put the knobs and what to set the settings at.

127
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,047
Speaker 0: It's different for everybody.

128
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:43,890
Speaker 1: Wow, Scott, you suddenly have a lot more knob respect than you did before when you were yelling at me for fiddling with knobs.

129
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:51,364
Speaker 0: OK, but you should not sit there yelling late into the night into your microphone at the top of your voice, fiddling with knobs while people are trying to sleep.

130
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,414
Speaker 1: Your light was on.

131
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:54,800
Speaker 1: You were definitely not trying to sleep.

132
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:58,389
Speaker 0: I would have read a lot less comics if you were yelling less.

133
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:04,669
Speaker 1: But basically we record geek nights through our microphones and pre amplifiers and all that.

134
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:08,727
Speaker 1: And then actually, I'm just going to tell you how we do it now with the new set up.

135
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:09,410
Speaker 1: All right.

136
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:14,713
Speaker 1: So then through the inserts that goes through a compressor, Scott and I each have our own noise gate and compressor.

137
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:20,280
Speaker 1: that right now are set the same, but I'm going to tweak them over time as I get more data as to how to make it sound better.

138
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,940
Speaker 1: And then it pretty much just gets recorded by our USB sound card into Audacity now instead of Resound.

139
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:28,183
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

140
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:33,905
Speaker 1: I feel bad about that because Resound is a thousand times the program Audacity will ever even pretend to be.

141
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:37,559
Speaker 1: But at the same time, Resound doesn't fucking work half the time.

142
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:38,361
Speaker 1: Yeah.

143
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:39,346
Speaker 0: What can we do?

144
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:43,499
Speaker 1: Mainly it's that Resound can't deal with most kinds of audio input.

145
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:48,159
Speaker 1: But regardless, I take the audio and I open it up in Resound after I've recorded it.

146
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:55,987
Speaker 1: And basically Resound has this facility that lets you make the equivalent of like the macros you used to make in the windows three one days.

147
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,196
Speaker 1: So I tell it, you know, I have.

148
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:01,262
Speaker 1: first I open all the files.

149
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:08,048
Speaker 1: So all the music, intro, exit bits, everything, the opener, the closer, the thing, everything we recorded by a script.

150
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:17,342
Speaker 1: And then I run another script that takes all these WAV files, puts them together exactly as they need to go in the right order, and then runs all the right filters on them.

151
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:19,769
Speaker 1: The filters are as follows.

152
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:33,376
Speaker 1: First, I use a low pass filter, sorry, a low cut filter, which gets rid of, you know, bumps and clicks and some breathing noise and any sort of hum or anything like that noise that no human voice is making.

153
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:34,320
Speaker 1: So you're not missing anything.

154
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like human voices are between this frequency and that frequency.

155
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:43,035
Speaker 0: So if you remove all noise below the low frequency, there's no there.

156
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:45,826
Speaker 0: if there's noise down there, it can't possibly be human voice.

157
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:46,971
Speaker 0: So it's just gone.

158
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:50,146
Speaker 0: And it, you know, if there's happens to be a bad noise down there, it's good.

159
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:51,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

160
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,990
Speaker 1: Now I'm experimenting, experimenting with hardware low cut instead of software.

161
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,120
Speaker 1: But anyway, just to do it before the compressor and everything.

162
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,246
Speaker 1: Then I run a low pass filter, which gets rid of the high end hissy stuff that you wouldn't hear again or care about anyway.

163
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:06,310
Speaker 0: Same thing, only high up.

164
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:08,780
Speaker 0: As long as no one goes, it'll be fine.

165
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,486
Speaker 1: Then I run another compressor.

166
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:14,385
Speaker 1: The compressor on the recording is just to keep the peaks down so I can record a really hot signal.

167
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:18,582
Speaker 1: I run a second gentler compressor just to kind of even out the volume.

168
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:24,426
Speaker 1: So if I get a little quieter or louder or Scott gets a little quieter or louder or we yell, the volume is all kind of the same.

169
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:28,044
Speaker 1: So it's not like some podcast where you just can't hear what people are saying

170
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:36,446
Speaker 0: or some podcast where the music is really loud and then you get to turn the volume up and it's changed the volume all the time while you listen to the show and this podcast, you set your volume once and you're all good.

171
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:37,489
Speaker 0: Yep.

172
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:56,299
Speaker 1: And then after that, I run my make room and Scott sound smarter filter, which I've explained this before, but basically it just goes through the audio and removes very tiny amounts of silence between words and phrases in just a little bit to make it sound like we're a lot more on top of things than we otherwise might be.

173
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:57,946
Speaker 1: It's very, very subtle.

174
00:10:57,987 --> 00:11:00,116
Speaker 1: You'd be hard pressed to tell if I ran it or not.

175
00:11:00,297 --> 00:11:05,999
Speaker 0: I think it really helps to keep the attention of all those YouTube generation audience people.

176
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:15,583
Speaker 1: You know, what it really helps for is when we interview people, because people who aren't used to being on the radio are not often the best at just keeping their train of thought going and that sort of filter.

177
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:22,006
Speaker 1: As Jeff to Terryk said to me after we interviewed him, wow, I sounded a lot smarter in that show than I do in real life.

178
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:22,447
Speaker 1: Yep.

179
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:23,712
Speaker 0: All right.

180
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:24,013
Speaker 0: We're done.

181
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:24,836
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

182
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:25,840
Speaker 1: Beyond that, whatever.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,542
Speaker 1: You don't care.

184
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:28,711
Speaker 0: What bands and music do you listen to?

185
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:29,374
Speaker 0: Lots.

186
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,382
Speaker 1: I think there's an easier way to answer this.

187
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:32,525
Speaker 0: What don't we listen to?

188
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:37,299
Speaker 1: I don't like a lot of modern gangsta style hip hop.

189
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:45,706
Speaker 0: I like hip hop and rap and such, but most of the modern, you know, gangsta stuff that you see on MTV and whatever I do not like.

190
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:48,354
Speaker 1: However, I like French gangster rap.

191
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:51,686
Speaker 1: I do maybe because I don't understand all of what they're saying.

192
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,559
Speaker 0: I do not like country music, but I like Western music.

193
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,552
Speaker 1: I really like Western music, but I don't dislike country music.

194
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:57,953
Speaker 0: Yeah.

195
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:00,082
Speaker 1: I'm also, I don't think you like folk.

196
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:03,293
Speaker 0: No, not really a fan of folk, but I like some.

197
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:06,082
Speaker 0: I like folk rock, but I don't like folk so much.

198
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:12,842
Speaker 0: Uh, and I guess I'm not really the biggest fan of like old contemporary kind of stuff.

199
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:13,988
Speaker 0: But other than that, what do you mean?

200
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,994
Speaker 1: old contemporary?

201
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:15,899
Speaker 1: That doesn't mean anything.

202
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,082
Speaker 0: Like if you turn on, you know, this is the oldies station, but nowadays the oldies station plays the Beatles.

203
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:23,736
Speaker 0: If you put on the double oldies station, which plays Elvis, right.

204
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:24,700
Speaker 0: That's okay.

205
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:29,059
Speaker 0: If you put in the triple oldies station that my grandma listens to that I do not like.

206
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:31,348
Speaker 1: Well, how much is that doggy in the window?

207
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,806
Speaker 0: Well, a little after that, but before Sinatra, sort of that in between stuff.

208
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:36,409
Speaker 1: I don't know.

209
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:38,639
Speaker 1: That didn't really describe a genre of music to me.

210
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,377
Speaker 0: I know it's, it's, it, I don't know what to call it except contemporary.

211
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:43,281
Speaker 0: Cause that's what it's called.

212
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:48,703
Speaker 1: I really like most classical and I really, really like Baroque music and I fugues anything with organs.

213
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:49,345
Speaker 1: I just love.

214
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:49,607
Speaker 0: Yeah.

215
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:57,314
Speaker 0: I don't know the different genres of the classical musics, like the, the Baroques and the, I can tell you this classical music is a sub genre, not a genre.

216
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:02,908
Speaker 0: I romanticism impressionism impressionisms.

217
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:05,337
Speaker 0: I'm not sure which ones I like.

218
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:09,186
Speaker 0: tone poems like Franz Liszt, but I like lots of them.

219
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,009
Speaker 0: I like Dvorak.

220
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:11,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, no.

221
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:12,933
Speaker 0: And I like Tchaikovsky.

222
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,651
Speaker 1: What about, what about my man Rimsky-Korsakov?

223
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:20,455
Speaker 0: I don't know who that is.

224
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:23,027
Speaker 0: I like Bach, the, the famous one, not the other one.

225
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,635
Speaker 1: The other one's also famous.

226
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:26,122
Speaker 1: The third and fourth ones aren't famous.

227
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:26,523
Speaker 0: I know.

228
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:29,051
Speaker 0: And, uh, I like the Choppin.

229
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:29,974
Speaker 0: I like the Choppin.

230
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:32,562
Speaker 1: And some S. Kargatne Chablis.

231
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:32,903
Speaker 1: Yes.

232
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:35,071
Speaker 0: The Choppin and you know, all those guys.

233
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:36,275
Speaker 0: I like lots of music.

234
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:37,921
Speaker 1: What about, uh, what's his name?

235
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:38,584
Speaker 1: Mussorgsky?

236
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:39,608
Speaker 0: I don't know.

237
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,560
Speaker 1: He did, uh, I think you know, I think you know him quite well.

238
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:51,228
Speaker 0: I guess if you really want to see the music I listen to like a percentage wise, just go to last.fm and look at what I listen to.

239
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:55,022
Speaker 1: I mean, right now, what I listen to, I listen to a lot of Ska.

240
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,657
Speaker 1: I've been listening to a lot of seventies disco because I really like disco.

241
00:13:59,018 --> 00:13:59,701
Speaker 0: I like disco too.

242
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:02,594
Speaker 1: I got some Boney M. I've been rocking it up with Boney M.

243
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:03,036
Speaker 0: Lately.

244
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:07,672
Speaker 0: I've been listening to the Who and the Beastie Boys lately.

245
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:08,073
Speaker 0: Yeah.

246
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,740
Speaker 1: I've also been listening to a lot of Queen.

247
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:10,701
Speaker 0: Yeah.

248
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:12,128
Speaker 0: It's hard not to listen to Queen.

249
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,941
Speaker 1: And the Ghost in the Shell soundtrack just because it's great.

250
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:16,065
Speaker 0: Oh, it's really great.

251
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:16,788
Speaker 0: Okay.

252
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,550
Speaker 1: All right.

253
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:19,918
Speaker 1: Can you pick a favorite song of all time?

254
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,507
Speaker 0: No, I can pick a favorite song of like the moment.

255
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:28,403
Speaker 1: I really, really, really like Fly High by Ayumi Hamasaki.

256
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:29,427
Speaker 1: Yeah.

257
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:34,067
Speaker 0: Some of her songs I like a lot too, but I don't think any of them would be even close to favorite status.

258
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:41,884
Speaker 1: That one in particular, it's one of those rare songs where the lyrics, I mean, the song's really good, but then I read the lyrics and they were actually surprisingly kind of meaningful.

259
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:42,768
Speaker 0: Yeah.

260
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:44,999
Speaker 0: It's weird because there's a lot of, there's no song.

261
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:57,202
Speaker 0: I mean, this is a few songs, but Stairway, you know, but it's like, you know, you listen to songs and there's certain parts of the song that make you go like, yeah, but some parts of some songs don't make you go.

262
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:57,925
Speaker 0: Yeah.

263
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:58,407
Speaker 0: You know?

264
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:00,516
Speaker 0: And it seems like all those yes.

265
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:02,882
Speaker 0: It's sort of equally maximize.

266
00:15:02,942 --> 00:15:06,213
Speaker 0: So the best song ever would just be all those amazing parts.

267
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:06,735
Speaker 1: Yeah.

268
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:10,309
Speaker 1: The thing is, we're not saying best song, we're saying our favorites.

269
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:10,852
Speaker 1: Yeah.

270
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:12,239
Speaker 1: I guess we get the songs.

271
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,967
Speaker 1: We really like painted black.

272
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:14,489
Speaker 0: Yeah.

273
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,858
Speaker 0: I mean, like for me to make a favorite song thing to be like, if I had a top 100 list, it would be a hundred songs all tied for number one.

274
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,179
Speaker 0: Yeah.

275
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:21,701
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

276
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:22,002
Speaker 0: Yeah.

277
00:15:22,564 --> 00:15:22,784
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

278
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:23,988
Speaker 1: All right.

279
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:28,200
Speaker 1: If you wrote a novel song, play movie, what would be the theme?

280
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,724
Speaker 0: What would be the theme?

281
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:30,828
Speaker 1: All right.

282
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,367
Speaker 1: I think they meant theme and in some sort of colloquial sense, but I'm gonna use theme in a more literary sense.

283
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,066
Speaker 1: I would probably make something that shows the dangers of anti-intellectualism.

284
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:45,073
Speaker 0: Oh, you stole my idea.

285
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:53,159
Speaker 1: I would just pick something that I was like, you know, or something along the lines of one man can walk forward on his own two legs.

286
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:53,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

287
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,117
Speaker 0: Something like I would just pick something that was like bothering me lately and then try to get that message across and then make some and then something else bothering me.

288
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:02,166
Speaker 0: I try to get that message across and so on.

289
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:05,459
Speaker 1: I thought I've always I have a couple ideas for stories.

290
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:09,400
Speaker 1: I've thought about a lot of times and every time I sit down to write him, I decide I can't write and I give up.

291
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,182
Speaker 0: I can't write.

292
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:13,112
Speaker 1: Oh, speaking of which, this next one's kind of relevant.

293
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:14,156
Speaker 0: All right.

294
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:17,586
Speaker 0: What do you think a fan fiction ever write?

295
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:17,887
Speaker 0: one?

296
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:20,734
Speaker 1: Well, to the latter, no, actually.

297
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:21,997
Speaker 0: Oh, huh.

298
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:22,980
Speaker 1: Ready for this?

299
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,682
Speaker 1: I'm ready.

300
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:25,106
Speaker 0: When I was like a kid, right?

301
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:29,139
Speaker 0: Like way kid, like, I don't know, 12, maybe.

302
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,042
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

303
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:31,186
Speaker 0: Maybe 10.

304
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:31,587
Speaker 1: Yeah.

305
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:32,089
Speaker 1: 10 months ago.

306
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,618
Speaker 0: I think that's 10 years when I was 10 years old.

307
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:35,642
Speaker 0: So like 1992.

308
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:35,842
Speaker 0: Wow.

309
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,467
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

310
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:40,175
Speaker 0: But anyway, I like.

311
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:41,338
Speaker 0: I didn't even understand.

312
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:44,328
Speaker 0: I didn't even realize fan fiction existed or was a thing.

313
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:44,689
Speaker 0: Right.

314
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:54,503
Speaker 0: But I had like school supplies and I like school supplies and I like using them, you know, so I had some paper and had a binder and I thought I kind of wanted to use it.

315
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:55,567
Speaker 0: I had a nice new pen.

316
00:16:55,587 --> 00:16:56,109
Speaker 0: Right.

317
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:58,017
Speaker 0: So I'm like, all right, something.

318
00:16:58,037 --> 00:17:03,095
Speaker 0: And since I can't write, you know, whatever, I said, oh, I have a genius idea.

319
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:06,424
Speaker 0: I'll write a story about the Transformers.

320
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:09,792
Speaker 1: But this I did not know.

321
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:12,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, this has been hidden secret for many years.

322
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,126
Speaker 0: It's not like a secret or anything.

323
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:17,819
Speaker 0: Well, anyway, it's a secret to everyone to make it even funnier.

324
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,223
Speaker 0: Right.

325
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:23,459
Speaker 0: I I hadn't even like seen Transformers in like eight years at that point.

326
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:26,791
Speaker 0: So I barely remembered anything except like Megatron was a god.

327
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:27,374
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

328
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:28,156
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

329
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:32,252
Speaker 1: So you were 10 and you hadn't seen Transformers in like eight years.

330
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:32,673
Speaker 1: Yep.

331
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:35,062
Speaker 1: So you had watched Transformers when you were two.

332
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:39,718
Speaker 0: And I must say, I watched it long enough ago that I didn't remember.

333
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,813
Speaker 0: OK, at that time, I remember it more now than I remember that.

334
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:48,676
Speaker 1: And if that's I'm just doing some police work here to figure out when this actually happened, I was to check it out.

335
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:56,045
Speaker 0: So like one day I was sitting there and I wrote like two pages and it was basically like there was an evil secret lab.

336
00:17:56,607 --> 00:18:00,000
Speaker 0: Megatron told the scientists to make something evil, but he didn't want to.

337
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,807
Speaker 0: But then he did that.

338
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,449
Speaker 0: Then I stopped.

339
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:03,212
Speaker 0: And then that was it.

340
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:04,477
Speaker 1: That's kind of saga.

341
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think saga.

342
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:07,226
Speaker 0: Yeah.

343
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,879
Speaker 0: And then I stopped writing and then I never started doing it again.

344
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:11,704
Speaker 0: because what do you mean?

345
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:12,568
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know.

346
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:13,432
Speaker 0: I didn't want to.

347
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,237
Speaker 0: And I sucked at writing.

348
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:14,779
Speaker 0: I didn't care.

349
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,387
Speaker 0: I didn't remember anything about Transformers.

350
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,452
Speaker 0: I friend.

351
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:24,464
Speaker 0: And then later when fan fiction came around, I thought back to that and said, oh, I was not an original idea to use someone else's make a story.

352
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,955
Speaker 1: See, frankly, fan fiction doesn't bother me at all.

353
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:29,848
Speaker 1: I mean, it's easy to make fun of, but people can do whatever they want.

354
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:30,350
Speaker 0: It's cool.

355
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:30,912
Speaker 0: It's cool.

356
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:32,740
Speaker 0: You can it's creative endeavors.

357
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,867
Speaker 0: You're just borrowing someone's characters.

358
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:36,312
Speaker 0: It's like doujinshi.

359
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:36,975
Speaker 0: It's cool.

360
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:38,781
Speaker 0: I think she has drawing also.

361
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:47,549
Speaker 1: The reason fan fiction is so maligned is that to be perfectly blunt, ninety nine percent of it is is so vile.

362
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:51,741
Speaker 1: And I'm not even talking about the erotic fan fiction, just beyond the tail.

363
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,025
Speaker 1: I can't.

364
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,820
Speaker 0: Well, it's not so much the content, right, that it happens to be sexual or violent.

365
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,687
Speaker 1: Oh, it's written poorly.

366
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,112
Speaker 0: Oh, and that it's written poorly.

367
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:09,579
Speaker 0: The thing that bothers me the most about most fan fiction is that it's not actually someone trying to write a story to entertain others.

368
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:19,008
Speaker 0: It's someone else who has some sort of fantasy about fictional characters like living out their fantasy and putting a dot on paper for the world to see.

369
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,834
Speaker 0: And I guess I don't know.

370
00:19:20,854 --> 00:19:22,680
Speaker 0: It's sort of disturbing.

371
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,571
Speaker 0: It's it's like, why are you showing me your horrible fantasy?

372
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:28,103
Speaker 0: And then why is your fantasy horrible?

373
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,409
Speaker 0: Why isn't your fantasy nice?

374
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:31,259
Speaker 1: See, now, that doesn't bother me either.

375
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:32,302
Speaker 1: I mean, people.

376
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:35,256
Speaker 1: I think it's cool that people have that, you know, have things like that.

377
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:42,075
Speaker 1: I think the only problem with fan fiction is that most fan fiction isn't really fan fiction like.

378
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:47,515
Speaker 1: it'll have cloud and Sephiroth in it, but they don't act like cloud or Sephiroth.

379
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:48,820
Speaker 1: They have nothing to do with fun.

380
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:51,834
Speaker 1: It might as well be two other people with different names.

381
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:57,135
Speaker 1: It's like they write a story that has nothing to do with the thing they're so supposedly writing a fan work about.

382
00:19:57,838 --> 00:20:00,267
Speaker 1: And then they say it's about this fan work.

383
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:05,465
Speaker 1: It's it's like, why not just write your own story if it has nothing to do with your source material to begin with?

384
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:06,106
Speaker 0: Yeah.

385
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:07,430
Speaker 1: All right.

386
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,836
Speaker 1: Anyway, moving on.

387
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,377
Speaker 1: You might have already talked about this in passing episodes, so I can't that blah, blah, blah.

388
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:16,621
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a long question.

389
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:28,392
Speaker 1: In your opinions, at what point does a work move from being derivative to something being in the same genre of something, i.e.

390
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:35,588
Speaker 1: when does something stop being a clone of Lensman, Lord of the Rings, Resident Evil and start being space opera sort of?

391
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:37,472
Speaker 1: Is it shameless copy?

392
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:43,853
Speaker 0: I'm saying, you know, because you have two pieces of art, right?

393
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:45,360
Speaker 0: And they have things in common.

394
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:48,587
Speaker 1: I can actually I can answer this pretty simply.

395
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:58,032
Speaker 1: When a genre is defined by a work, do other works become derivative or are they in that genre?

396
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:01,002
Speaker 1: I think that's a better question to answer.

397
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,214
Speaker 0: I think that is a better question than the question he asked.

398
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:04,400
Speaker 0: The thing is this right.

399
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:13,621
Speaker 0: The fundamental problem here is you have works of art and certain works of art have things in common and usually when they have things in common, if you like one, you might like the other.

400
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:23,461
Speaker 0: So what we do is we put labels on these things and like we say these are fantasy and you can be pretty sure if you like one, there's a good chance you like others because they're in the same genre.

401
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:29,302
Speaker 0: They have a lot in common, be it settings or, you know, the narrative themes and such and such and such.

402
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:29,563
Speaker 0: Right.

403
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:37,112
Speaker 0: The thing is, sometimes someone comes along and creates a work of art that doesn't have a lot in common with other works of art.

404
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:37,514
Speaker 0: Right.

405
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:41,092
Speaker 0: And of course, everything anyone ever makes borrows things from other things.

406
00:21:41,152 --> 00:21:42,740
Speaker 0: It's pretty much nothing is original.

407
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,221
Speaker 0: Nothing.

408
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:43,662
Speaker 0: All right.

409
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:47,940
Speaker 0: Sometimes someone just copies something else, like someone just writes a story.

410
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,327
Speaker 0: It's exactly the same as Star Wars.

411
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:50,695
Speaker 0: And they change the names of the characters.

412
00:21:51,318 --> 00:21:52,162
Speaker 0: That's derivative.

413
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:55,956
Speaker 0: Sometimes someone writes something that has some similarities.

414
00:21:56,097 --> 00:22:01,031
Speaker 0: And this is giant grayscale from exactly the same to not the same at all.

415
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,203
Speaker 0: And some everything is somewhere on that grayscale.

416
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:13,134
Speaker 0: And if you want to label something as derivative instead of just being in the same genre or whatever, well, that's it's up to you, whatever you want.

417
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:13,937
Speaker 1: Yeah.

418
00:22:13,997 --> 00:22:23,023
Speaker 1: Plus, I mean, it is tricky when something like Cowboy Bebop basically made a new genre of show it by borrowing something from everything.

419
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:27,478
Speaker 0: It there's nothing you can really put in the same genre as Cowboy Bebop.

420
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:29,627
Speaker 0: It has not a lot in common with anything.

421
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,555
Speaker 0: So I guess it borrows from anything.

422
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:37,276
Speaker 1: But because it defined the genre by definition, everything that is in that genre will be derivative.

423
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:43,878
Speaker 1: that not so much for any useful demarcation, just simply because the genre is defined by that.

424
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:46,690
Speaker 0: I mean, it doesn't even mean that they're copying Cowboy Bebop.

425
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,053
Speaker 0: Someone could, by chance, create a work of art that is in the same genre as Cowboy Bebop and has many similarities to it.

426
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,547
Speaker 0: Yet they might have never even seen Cowboy Bebop or known it existed.

427
00:22:56,229 --> 00:23:00,443
Speaker 0: But, you know, so you just sort of have to investigate and figure out.

428
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:06,967
Speaker 0: And it's it's really not hard to tell when someone just copied something else or when someone actually created something new.

429
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:08,894
Speaker 0: All right.

430
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:10,279
Speaker 1: I guess you can ask the next one.

431
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,147
Speaker 0: Top five movies of all time.

432
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:17,344
Speaker 0: Most of these people, they've tried to ask these questions like, pick your favorite song.

433
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:18,167
Speaker 0: It's not possible.

434
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:25,572
Speaker 1: Well, maybe they want, you know, best movies, top five, maybe the movies that are best done overall.

435
00:23:25,913 --> 00:23:43,985
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, the sort of it's sort of tough because if you want if you ask me what my favorite movies are, I'll probably be like Star Wars, Such and Such, Matrix, I don't know, Miyazaki movies of some kind, some Satoshi Kann's got to be up there somewhere.

436
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:44,266
Speaker 0: Right.

437
00:23:44,948 --> 00:23:51,348
Speaker 0: But if you ask me what the best star, I'll probably be like Citizen Kane, City of God.

438
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:53,313
Speaker 1: Oh, City of God.

439
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,937
Speaker 1: I want to watch that again right now.

440
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:55,980
Speaker 0: City of God.

441
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:04,196
Speaker 0: That movie, Reservoir Dogs, maybe Godfather, definitely.

442
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:05,238
Speaker 0: Yeah.

443
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,140
Speaker 0: The first one, at least.

444
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,521
Speaker 1: I don't know.

445
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:12,185
Speaker 0: We could just randomly name movies we like, but that I'm sort of doing that already, but it's sort of lame.

446
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:15,423
Speaker 0: That's why I tried to avoid doing that in the favorite song question, because it's lame.

447
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:15,945
Speaker 1: All right.

448
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:16,588
Speaker 1: Let's just move on.

449
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:16,890
Speaker 1: Yep.

450
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:20,064
Speaker 1: You have from a practical standpoint, unlimited money.

451
00:24:20,145 --> 00:24:22,173
Speaker 1: I think you were misappraised as to how much money I have.

452
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:25,785
Speaker 1: Anyway, what do you buy?

453
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:26,828
Speaker 1: Commission create.

454
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,896
Speaker 1: Don't give me investing crap.

455
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,983
Speaker 1: You already have more De Niro than you can possibly spend.

456
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:34,133
Speaker 1: I think the answer is pretty obvious.

457
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:34,936
Speaker 0: You see.

458
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:37,003
Speaker 0: Oh, let's see how obvious your answer is.

459
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:43,264
Speaker 1: I met a traveler from an antique land who said two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert.

460
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:50,105
Speaker 1: near them on the sand, have sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown and snare of cold command.

461
00:24:50,145 --> 00:24:50,768
Speaker 1: Did you bring this?

462
00:24:50,828 --> 00:24:52,012
Speaker 1: Did you let it sculptor?

463
00:24:52,373 --> 00:25:01,469
Speaker 1: Well, those passions read, which gets survived, stamped on these lifeless things, the hand that mocked them in the heart that fed and on one pedestal, these words appear.

464
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:04,820
Speaker 1: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings.

465
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,688
Speaker 1: Look upon my work, see mighty and despair.

466
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,575
Speaker 0: All right.

467
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,544
Speaker 1: I read the question while you were answering the previous one.

468
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:16,973
Speaker 1: And there is only one answer I could give to that.

469
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:22,514
Speaker 0: Well, I'd have to say, actually, my clever answer to that is not as clever as Rem's answer.

470
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:36,363
Speaker 0: But basically, if I had from a practical standpoint, unlimited money, I would buy commission and create very little because I don't want to ruin the world's economy with horrible inflation because I'm not that dumb.

471
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:41,666
Speaker 0: If I started spending my money like a nutcase, the world would probably fall to shit and the money wouldn't be worth anything.

472
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:49,474
Speaker 1: Now, if it were simply the matter that I have a lot of power in the world to commission great works, then look mighty.

473
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:53,183
Speaker 1: Well, seriously, I don't know.

474
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,975
Speaker 1: I do great things, change the world, that sort of thing.

475
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:56,376
Speaker 0: Yeah.

476
00:25:56,497 --> 00:25:58,303
Speaker 0: Trains, buildings.

477
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:01,855
Speaker 1: Oh, I think the next question will answer this.

478
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,644
Speaker 1: The next question is secret moon base or secret volcano layer.

479
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:11,423
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't have any other choices because I really like secret undersea city.

480
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:12,365
Speaker 0: Yeah.

481
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:13,989
Speaker 1: Full of Chrysler buildings.

482
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:14,490
Speaker 1: Yeah.

483
00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:18,840
Speaker 0: But a floating castle in the sky.

484
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:27,224
Speaker 0: I really don't like moon base or volcano layer because volcano layer has a stupid lava all the time and moon base.

485
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:28,067
Speaker 0: Where am I going to eat?

486
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:28,709
Speaker 0: Right.

487
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:34,191
Speaker 0: So it is a pain in the ass of maintaining the moon base and the volcano layer is too dangerous.

488
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:35,034
Speaker 0: So I like.

489
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:35,316
Speaker 0: I like.

490
00:26:35,336 --> 00:26:35,517
Speaker 0: Yes.

491
00:26:35,718 --> 00:26:39,853
Speaker 1: The volcano layer is so much more dangerous than the moon.

492
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:41,158
Speaker 0: They're both dangerous.

493
00:26:41,178 --> 00:26:42,442
Speaker 0: That's why I don't like either one.

494
00:26:42,482 --> 00:26:43,406
Speaker 0: They're both bad.

495
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,533
Speaker 1: Why can't I position?

496
00:26:45,694 --> 00:26:49,908
Speaker 1: Why can't my secret base just be all Batman style just under my mansion?

497
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:51,675
Speaker 0: See, that's a nice defensible position.

498
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:54,366
Speaker 0: A volcano and the moon are not defensible.

499
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:55,934
Speaker 1: Well, the moon is very defensible.

500
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:57,582
Speaker 1: You've got the biggest fucking mode in the world.

501
00:26:57,662 --> 00:26:58,827
Speaker 0: I'm cheating on this question.

502
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:00,272
Speaker 0: Floating castle in the sky.

503
00:27:00,293 --> 00:27:00,594
Speaker 0: I win.

504
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:03,663
Speaker 0: La, la, la, la, la.

505
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:04,646
Speaker 1: We know that.

506
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:06,170
Speaker 0: Yeah.

507
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:06,952
Speaker 0: But it's still cool.

508
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:08,917
Speaker 1: If you could this is a tough one.

509
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:14,993
Speaker 1: If you could choose to have the ability to never need sleep again, would you?

510
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:17,621
Speaker 1: You could not sleep even if you wanted to.

511
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:22,416
Speaker 1: You would never feel sleepy or tired and everyone else would sleep as normal.

512
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:25,366
Speaker 0: Oh, if I never felt sleepy or tired.

513
00:27:25,407 --> 00:27:26,671
Speaker 0: Well, here's the problem.

514
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:31,007
Speaker 0: It's, you know, sleepy and tiredness is sort of this gradual thing.

515
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:31,328
Speaker 0: Right.

516
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:34,621
Speaker 0: So, I mean, you could feel really energized and really go get them.

517
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:37,410
Speaker 0: You could also feel kind of a right.

518
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:40,720
Speaker 0: And sometimes I'm kind of a but not really tired.

519
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:41,963
Speaker 0: I might want to sleep.

520
00:27:42,184 --> 00:27:43,126
Speaker 1: I'll just masturbate.

521
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:44,068
Speaker 0: That's true.

522
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:45,111
Speaker 0: But that makes me sleepy.

523
00:27:45,191 --> 00:27:56,410
Speaker 0: If I could stay kind of energized, like if Red Bull wouldn't destroy my heart or anything like that, you know, I could really feel like go get them all the time.

524
00:27:56,932 --> 00:28:00,807
Speaker 0: You know, like I could actually be really productive being awake all the time.

525
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,516
Speaker 0: Then, yes, I would not want to sleep.

526
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:09,160
Speaker 0: But if there were going to be times where I'd feel and just kind of sit there bored, then no, I'd probably rather sleep.

527
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:15,707
Speaker 1: Well, you see, this is the reason I think this is an interesting question is that it's basically as it's transhumanism.

528
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:20,002
Speaker 1: It's asking if given the opportunity, would you give up your humanity?

529
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:25,260
Speaker 1: Because part of being human is that we're these biological organisms and we have.

530
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:27,326
Speaker 1: there's only so much we can do in a day.

531
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:32,904
Speaker 1: And philosophically, you have to decide what kind of being you are.

532
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:37,763
Speaker 1: Do you what is more important to you, your human happiness or the ability to do great things?

533
00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:41,619
Speaker 1: I mean, by giving up sleep, you're giving up something that makes you human.

534
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,128
Speaker 1: I mean, I really enjoy sleep.

535
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,890
Speaker 1: Sleep.

536
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,737
Speaker 1: Being tired is part of the human experience.

537
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:48,244
Speaker 1: And you're falling asleep and waking up.

538
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:52,607
Speaker 0: Even in Ghost in the Shell, you always see the cyborgs like going to sleep and stuff, even if they don't have to.

539
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:56,002
Speaker 1: It's just or like Batos lifting the weights, even though he doesn't have to.

540
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:56,223
Speaker 1: And.

541
00:28:56,303 --> 00:28:57,147
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

542
00:28:57,408 --> 00:28:58,131
Speaker 1: But it's kind of this.

543
00:28:58,452 --> 00:28:59,396
Speaker 1: sleep is wonderful.

544
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,564
Speaker 1: It's this kind of I like sleeping.

545
00:29:01,604 --> 00:29:02,226
Speaker 1: I like dreaming.

546
00:29:02,246 --> 00:29:07,284
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I feel like I could do a lot for this world if I only had more time.

547
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:07,946
Speaker 1: Yep.

548
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:17,058
Speaker 1: And I think in the end, I would probably give up my humanity in order to accomplish more great work, I think, and then say into the world that lucky might.

549
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:18,102
Speaker 0: I think a lot of works.

550
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:27,360
Speaker 0: I think a lot of the problems with these questions is that I basically I need to guarantee that when I give up my humanity, I'm actually making a step forward and not a step backwards.

551
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:38,698
Speaker 0: For example, if I could stay up all night, but then if I still if I died earlier because I was I only had so many waking hours in my life and then I died, then it's not a step forward.

552
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:40,365
Speaker 0: It's really sort of a step backwards.

553
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:45,786
Speaker 1: But if you died earlier, but you got to live all of your life in your prime youth.

554
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:47,253
Speaker 0: I know it's it's a tough question.

555
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:52,034
Speaker 0: I need basically I need a guarantee that I'm actually, you know, it's actually going to be better.

556
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:58,062
Speaker 0: if it's if I can't guarantee that I'm actually doing better than I was doing before, then I'm not going to make a permanent decision like this.

557
00:29:59,046 --> 00:29:59,307
Speaker 0: All right.

558
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:02,218
Speaker 0: Why is the show called Rim and Scott and not Scott and Rim?

559
00:30:02,238 --> 00:30:03,463
Speaker 0: Because Rim and Scott sounds better.

560
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:04,769
Speaker 1: We tried them both.

561
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,754
Speaker 1: One sounded better.

562
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:06,859
Speaker 1: It was totally arbitrary.

563
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:07,019
Speaker 0: Yeah.

564
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,450
Speaker 0: Why is Scott known as my screen?

565
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:11,273
Speaker 0: Right.

566
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:13,600
Speaker 0: So have I told the story of the show before?

567
00:30:14,442 --> 00:30:14,804
Speaker 1: I don't know.

568
00:30:14,824 --> 00:30:17,298
Speaker 0: I guess I'll tell it again, even if I have told it before.

569
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:17,740
Speaker 0: Whatever.

570
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,694
Speaker 0: So it's put yourself back in time to nineteen ninety seven or eight.

571
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:25,336
Speaker 0: Right.

572
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,260
Speaker 0: AOL, AOL days.

573
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:27,581
Speaker 0: Right.

574
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,126
Speaker 0: I need an AOL account.

575
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:30,229
Speaker 0: I need a screen name.

576
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:34,262
Speaker 0: I chose Taser and AOL decided to put three one four six.

577
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:42,798
Speaker 0: So at the end of that, because someone else already had Taser and I chose Taser because there was an old DOS game where you couldn't actually type in your own name.

578
00:30:42,818 --> 00:30:44,790
Speaker 0: You had to choose one of the names from a list.

579
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,982
Speaker 0: And I always chose Taser from the list because that one was green.

580
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:50,635
Speaker 0: So I used Taser and someone else put numbers at the end of it.

581
00:30:50,675 --> 00:30:53,809
Speaker 0: So on AOL, there was a game called Gemstone three.

582
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:54,371
Speaker 0: It was a mud.

583
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:57,687
Speaker 0: I didn't know was a mud at the time, but it was a mud and it was pretty good mud.

584
00:30:58,028 --> 00:31:01,402
Speaker 0: And now then they eventually charged money for it instead of making it free.

585
00:31:01,663 --> 00:31:02,346
Speaker 0: So I stopped playing.

586
00:31:02,848 --> 00:31:08,833
Speaker 0: But when I did play Gemstone three, the first mod I ever played, not knowing it was a mud, I need a screen name for that.

587
00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:10,180
Speaker 0: That was separate from my AOL name.

588
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,712
Speaker 0: So I tried Taser and he wanted it wouldn't work.

589
00:31:12,993 --> 00:31:15,525
Speaker 0: And I didn't want to put numbers at the end of this role playing name.

590
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:17,615
Speaker 0: You know, I wanted to have it just be a name like everyone else.

591
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:18,961
Speaker 0: So that didn't work.

592
00:31:19,442 --> 00:31:31,855
Speaker 0: So I started trying names like Frodo, Gandalf, Luke Skywalker, Vader, all sorts of Lord of the Rings, Star Wars names, Transformers names, Thundercats names.

593
00:31:32,277 --> 00:31:33,000
Speaker 0: None of the names work.

594
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,722
Speaker 0: They were all taken.

595
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:36,250
Speaker 0: Of course, I was a naive 13 year old kid.

596
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:36,992
Speaker 0: What do I know?

597
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,200
Speaker 0: So what do I do?

598
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,784
Speaker 0: I tried.

599
00:31:40,804 --> 00:31:44,761
Speaker 0: I was thinking because I just came back from summer camp recently and we did the Apache relay.

600
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,247
Speaker 0: So I'm like, oh, Apache is not too bad.

601
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:48,355
Speaker 0: So try Apache taken.

602
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:52,370
Speaker 0: I accidentally misspelled Apache slightly and it totally works.

603
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,377
Speaker 0: And I had a name that looked like a name.

604
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:56,906
Speaker 0: that was a fantasy kind of name that worked.

605
00:31:57,308 --> 00:31:58,633
Speaker 0: Didn't need any numbers at the end of it.

606
00:31:59,054 --> 00:32:04,680
Speaker 0: Wasn't a real word in any language that I could find or nor a conjugation of any word that I could find on the Internet.

607
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,766
Speaker 0: Search for it on Altavista.

608
00:32:06,786 --> 00:32:07,408
Speaker 0: Nothing came up.

609
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:10,820
Speaker 0: And I said, hey, I sort of have this like unique name.

610
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:12,207
Speaker 0: Who knows how to pronounce it?

611
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:12,952
Speaker 0: Who cares?

612
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,299
Speaker 0: Because I was only ever going to type it.

613
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,576
Speaker 0: And to this day, I think I'm the only one using that name and it works.

614
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,089
Speaker 0: I get this name I want on every website and I don't need to put numbers at the end.

615
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:27,463
Speaker 0: And it it's just a practical username on the Internet.

616
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:29,873
Speaker 0: And I don't go by the name like some people.

617
00:32:30,636 --> 00:32:31,761
Speaker 0: And I don't know how to pronounce it.

618
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:32,223
Speaker 0: It's up to you.

619
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:33,668
Speaker 0: And nor do I care.

620
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:35,697
Speaker 0: People know what you're talking about.

621
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:36,460
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

622
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:45,249
Speaker 1: I mean, my first Internet name was origins, and that's because I was sitting there and I had to log into Prodigy Classic for the first time.

623
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:46,393
Speaker 1: I'm all excited.

624
00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:51,169
Speaker 1: I needed a screen name and I look up there's a big old copy of Origin of Species.

625
00:32:51,931 --> 00:32:52,453
Speaker 0: Ah, good one.

626
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:53,416
Speaker 1: Yep.

627
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:54,680
Speaker 0: All right.

628
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,520
Speaker 0: Raymond Scott, if I have a project I want to do, how do I best go about planning and executing it?

629
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,711
Speaker 1: Well, first you plan it and then you do it.

630
00:33:02,193 --> 00:33:03,580
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

631
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:08,496
Speaker 1: I think we did a show on how to not suck at doing things way, way back.

632
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:10,263
Speaker 0: I don't know.

633
00:33:10,544 --> 00:33:11,771
Speaker 0: Let's skip this stupid question.

634
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:13,861
Speaker 1: It's a good question, but that would be a whole show.

635
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:15,044
Speaker 0: So it's so generic.

636
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:17,631
Speaker 1: It's basically how do you live?

637
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:19,877
Speaker 0: How do you do things?

638
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:21,180
Speaker 0: You set a goal.

639
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:22,925
Speaker 0: You make a plan.

640
00:33:23,227 --> 00:33:25,073
Speaker 0: You do research.

641
00:33:25,114 --> 00:33:25,776
Speaker 1: I'll tell you this.

642
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:26,860
Speaker 1: I got a good piece of advice.

643
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:39,141
Speaker 1: Whenever you try really hard, whenever you get motivated, planning to do something and especially if other people rely on you, you've got to think from the perspective of what if everything goes wrong?

644
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:40,707
Speaker 1: What is my contingency plan?

645
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:43,196
Speaker 1: If for every possible thing I can think of.

646
00:33:43,537 --> 00:33:46,006
Speaker 1: So you're ready whenever anything happens.

647
00:33:46,548 --> 00:33:46,768
Speaker 0: Yep.

648
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:48,133
Speaker 0: Think of every possibility.

649
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:50,461
Speaker 1: And yeah, like you're going on a trip.

650
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:51,124
Speaker 1: All right.

651
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:51,867
Speaker 0: Do everything.

652
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:53,453
Speaker 0: I got the whole power into it.

653
00:33:53,594 --> 00:33:54,297
Speaker 1: I got the hotel.

654
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:55,663
Speaker 1: I called the hotel the night before.

655
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:56,729
Speaker 1: They said they have the reservation.

656
00:33:57,091 --> 00:33:59,967
Speaker 1: What will I do if I get there and they still don't have the reservation?

657
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:02,340
Speaker 1: What do I do if I get there and I don't have my wallet anymore?

658
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,484
Speaker 1: What if my car breaks down?

659
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:07,259
Speaker 1: And a lot of these plans are generic and multipurpose.

660
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,795
Speaker 1: So once you have them, much like the US, you don't need to update them until things change.

661
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:15,552
Speaker 1: I mean, we didn't need to change our Canada invasion plans until cars were invented.

662
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:16,234
Speaker 1: Yep.

663
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:17,096
Speaker 1: All right.

664
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:18,882
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a tough one.

665
00:34:18,902 --> 00:34:20,027
Speaker 0: All right.

666
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:35,530
Speaker 1: If you were trapped in a small town in the middle of the desert, would your chances of survival be greater if, A, you were being hunted by a gang of 10 vampires flying, vulnerable to stakes, fire, sunlight and silver?

667
00:34:36,472 --> 00:34:38,918
Speaker 1: only turn you into one if they want to?

668
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:45,474
Speaker 1: Or if you were one of 10 people left alive in a town full of zombies.

669
00:34:45,514 --> 00:34:50,329
Speaker 1: These are slow, mindless, flesh hungry, turn you into one once bitten zombies.

670
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:53,018
Speaker 1: Assume average man on the street.

671
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:56,051
Speaker 1: intelligence for all other sentient individuals involved.

672
00:34:56,272 --> 00:34:58,522
Speaker 1: Well, I'm fucked because normal people can't deal with this.

673
00:34:58,582 --> 00:34:59,205
Speaker 0: That's right.

674
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:00,411
Speaker 0: So what do you much kill?

675
00:35:00,491 --> 00:35:01,275
Speaker 1: all the other people?

676
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,422
Speaker 1: And then I can survive both situations.

677
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:10,097
Speaker 0: It depends on because he doesn't make any suggestion indication.

678
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:12,143
Speaker 0: Small town in the middle of the desert.

679
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:15,215
Speaker 0: But I mean, I mean, is this like a ghost town?

680
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:17,404
Speaker 0: Just a few wooden buildings that are full of nothing.

681
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:21,920
Speaker 0: It depends a lot on the tools I have because he says vulnerable to stakes.

682
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,949
Speaker 0: So I can probably get some stakes, right?

683
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:27,606
Speaker 1: The stakes aren't going to help because they can kill you when they're awake.

684
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:29,475
Speaker 0: It says they're vulnerable to fire, though.

685
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:30,137
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

686
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:30,258
Speaker 1: Right.

687
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:34,051
Speaker 0: And actually, no, I'm picking the vampires and here's why.

688
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:34,593
Speaker 0: Why?

689
00:35:34,914 --> 00:35:36,399
Speaker 0: Okay, here is why.

690
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,363
Speaker 1: Alright, it's daylight.

691
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:38,507
Speaker 1: Exactly.

692
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:39,291
Speaker 0: It's daylight.

693
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:39,913
Speaker 1: Where are they?

694
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:40,495
Speaker 1: You don't know.

695
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:42,222
Speaker 1: Didn't you ever see the Lost Boys?

696
00:35:42,242 --> 00:35:44,248
Speaker 1: They got to find the vampires first.

697
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:49,644
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter because with the vampires, there's no other.

698
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:54,606
Speaker 0: See, with the zombies, there's 10 people left alive in the town with me who are going to cause me shit with the vampires.

699
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:55,209
Speaker 0: There aren't.

700
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:59,710
Speaker 0: And with the vampires, if I can survive until daylight, I can just get the fuck out of there.

701
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:04,190
Speaker 1: Alright, let's assume that you are more than a day's drive from the next civilization center.

702
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:07,362
Speaker 1: Or even if you get somewhere, you're being hunted.

703
00:36:07,422 --> 00:36:09,329
Speaker 1: That means that the vampires are going to follow you.

704
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:14,468
Speaker 0: even so, even so the vampires are vulnerable to fire and silver.

705
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:17,940
Speaker 0: So it's really easy to get lots of fire and lots of silver.

706
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,447
Speaker 0: I can just set the town on fire.

707
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:21,276
Speaker 0: I'll just burn the whole place down.

708
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:22,623
Speaker 0: Then what the vampire is going to fucking do?

709
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:25,000
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't get their coffins probably because they're not stupid.

710
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,324
Speaker 0: That doesn't matter.

711
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:27,671
Speaker 0: The whole place is on fire.

712
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:29,419
Speaker 0: I can survive for a fucking long time.

713
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,687
Speaker 0: Those vampires aren't coming anywhere near.

714
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,218
Speaker 1: The fire goes out in a couple of hours.

715
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:33,927
Speaker 0: And then it's daylight and I get the hell out of there.

716
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:37,525
Speaker 1: Alright, and then you go to sleep in a hotel the next night and then the vampires kill you.

717
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:40,778
Speaker 0: It says the vampires are in the small town.

718
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:42,003
Speaker 1: Obviously, you're being hunted.

719
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:43,309
Speaker 1: They'll follow you out of the town.

720
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,640
Speaker 0: I can get to somewhere safer, like a city.

721
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,969
Speaker 1: Nowhere is safe from vampires.

722
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:50,080
Speaker 1: It's not like vampires can't go into Manhattan.

723
00:36:51,081 --> 00:37:01,742
Speaker 0: I can get, if I can get out of the small town in the middle of the desert to a real civilization where there's lots of people and lots of things, I can take on pretty much any vampires or zombies or whatever.

724
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:02,507
Speaker 1: I don't think you could.

725
00:37:02,728 --> 00:37:05,964
Speaker 0: The only reason it's dangerous is because it's a small town in the desert.

726
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:09,739
Speaker 1: The thing is, I'll bet I could reason with the vampires a lot better.

727
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:10,543
Speaker 0: That's also true.

728
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:14,278
Speaker 1: Then I could reason with the 10 non-zombies in the zombie town.

729
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:14,780
Speaker 0: That's true.

730
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:29,241
Speaker 0: Even if I couldn't get away from the vampires, if I had the fire and the silver and the stakes, the silver would be easy to come by, but the fire, the sunlight and the stakes and the whatnot, I could probably have some sort of reasoning with the vampires, maybe get them to turn me into a vampire.

731
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:29,984
Speaker 0: Then I'd be all set.

732
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:31,871
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, you could always just turn.

733
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:38,682
Speaker 1: See, that's why Scott Johnson always says that if it's ever discovered that dark powers exist, he's probably going to come and kill us.

734
00:37:38,763 --> 00:37:41,634
Speaker 1: because you just said, "All right, I could just become a

735
00:37:41,654 --> 00:37:42,177
Speaker 1: vampire.".

736
00:37:42,237 --> 00:37:44,949
Speaker 1: I have often said, "Well, I could always use evil to fight

737
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:45,070
Speaker 1: evil.".

738
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,236
Speaker 0: Becoming a zombie sucks.

739
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:47,321
Speaker 0: Becoming a vampire is great.

740
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:47,943
Speaker 1: Yeah.

741
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:48,745
Speaker 0: All right.

742
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:49,448
Speaker 1: All right.

743
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:52,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll just leave that one at that.

744
00:37:52,056 --> 00:37:52,898
Speaker 1: Okay.

745
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:58,200
Speaker 1: So what's the worst injury, pain-wise, after-effect-wise, et cetera, either of you has ever received?

746
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:02,851
Speaker 1: Pain-wise, number one was when I got food poisoning.

747
00:38:03,674 --> 00:38:05,580
Speaker 0: I never really had such a pain.

748
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:08,729
Speaker 1: Number two was when I cut my finger off.

749
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:09,492
Speaker 0: Yep.

750
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,483
Speaker 1: Number three was when I had that bicycle spoke go through my leg.

751
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:13,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty bad.

752
00:38:13,347 --> 00:38:15,075
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

753
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:24,341
Speaker 0: Let's see, the only injuries I've had... I guess the worst injury I've had is when I fell on the side of my face when I had braces and one of the braces went into my lip and I had to go and get stitches in the lip.

754
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:30,026
Speaker 1: Oh wait, there was that time when I was a little kid and I got punched in the balls by fucking Steve.

755
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:35,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, stitches in the lip, that pretty much that whole experience I'd say was sort of the worst.

756
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:37,033
Speaker 0: I still have a lump there in my lip.

757
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:37,858
Speaker 0: You can feel it in there.

758
00:38:37,878 --> 00:38:40,229
Speaker 1: When I had that bicycle spoke go through, I only got two stitches.

759
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,098
Speaker 0: Yeah, my lip was much worse than that.

760
00:38:42,118 --> 00:38:45,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, the worst pain I've ever experienced in my whole life was when I got food poisoning.

761
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:53,282
Speaker 0: Yep, and I guess the only other time I really hurt myself was when I fell off the swing set and broke my collarbone, but that was just eh.

762
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:55,129
Speaker 0: I didn't even really bother me at all.

763
00:38:56,112 --> 00:38:56,674
Speaker 0: It was eh.

764
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:58,822
Speaker 0: I never really had much pain in my life.

765
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:07,528
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess I've had pretty bad pains from occasional stomach bugs, which are pretty painful and vomiting and such.

766
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:11,841
Speaker 0: It's not really painful, but it's unpleasant and that's really it.

767
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:14,329
Speaker 1: Ah, the next one is kind of related.

768
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:14,991
Speaker 0: Okay.

769
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:18,081
Speaker 0: What's the closest to dying that either of you have been?

770
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:20,350
Speaker 0: Well, I'm pretty sure, right?

771
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,763
Speaker 0: There was this one time I was on an airplane and usually I'm flying.

772
00:39:23,803 --> 00:39:24,787
Speaker 0: I'm just fine, whatever.

773
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:26,093
Speaker 0: I'm not afraid of flying.

774
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:34,946
Speaker 0: I don't get, you know, sick of the turbulence or anything, but just I was on this plane and I think it was a JetBlue plane to Rochester or Florida.

775
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:36,009
Speaker 0: I think it was to Florida.

776
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:39,659
Speaker 0: I don't remember, but I was on it alone.

777
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,285
Speaker 0: No one else I knew was with me.

778
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:41,546
Speaker 0: Right.

779
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:48,370
Speaker 0: And I just felt really, really shitty, like horribly shitty, shittier than ever felt in my life, like passing out shitty.

780
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:51,644
Speaker 0: And I was just randomly, I don't know why I felt this way.

781
00:39:51,685 --> 00:39:54,015
Speaker 0: I was thinking, you know, and I felt so shitty.

782
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:54,738
Speaker 0: I just didn't care.

783
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:58,273
Speaker 0: I was like, if someone's poison gassing the plane, I just don't care anymore.

784
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:00,261
Speaker 0: And I felt really, really shitty.

785
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:06,583
Speaker 0: And then the plane landed in like five, about a few minutes later, I recomposed myself and I was fine.

786
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:17,240
Speaker 0: And I didn't really know what the hell that was, but I assume I was pretty close to dying because even if I wasn't actually going to die, I had maybe given up on life almost.

787
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,323
Speaker 1: I know that feeling.

788
00:40:18,363 --> 00:40:26,273
Speaker 1: There was a time where I had Lyme disease way back and I didn't know I had Lyme disease and doctors are kind of stupid about Lyme disease.

789
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,719
Speaker 1: So I went to the doctor.

790
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,624
Speaker 1: He was like, yeah, take some aspirin, come back in a week.

791
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:37,164
Speaker 1: And then when I came back in a week, I came back to a go home and take this.

792
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:44,912
Speaker 1: But in that interim, I remember one time I had a fever kind of going the whole week and I woke up and I'm, I'm alone.

793
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:48,483
Speaker 1: I'm living in someone's condo in Poughkeepsie working at IBM on co-op.

794
00:40:49,425 --> 00:40:57,904
Speaker 1: And I woke up and I had like 104 fever and I had like, and I was kind of delirious from the fever.

795
00:40:57,924 --> 00:41:04,846
Speaker 1: So I'm laying there and I've got like this damp cloth that I don't remember getting, but it was on me.

796
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:05,809
Speaker 1: It was on my forehead.

797
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:17,691
Speaker 1: and I'm laying there thinking, I wonder if I'm going to die before the sun comes up and I go to the doctor and my brain couldn't get to the point of maybe you should just call an ambulance now.

798
00:41:18,594 --> 00:41:20,000
Speaker 1: That would save you no matter what.

799
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:23,613
Speaker 1: No, my brain just thought, well, probably going to die.

800
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:27,649
Speaker 0: It's like that guy said, he was talking about, you know, uh, patient autonomy.

801
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:33,391
Speaker 0: And he's like this person who may not be in the best position to make a decision is forced to make a decision.

802
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,897
Speaker 1: Fever dreams are weird in that way.

803
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:47,651
Speaker 1: Uh, there's also the time there's a long story as to the lead up to this, but I was driving a friend back from Long Island to Rochester and I was going about 90 give or take.

804
00:41:48,813 --> 00:41:55,793
Speaker 1: And my rear left wheel exploded and she was asleep at the time.

805
00:41:56,075 --> 00:42:02,588
Speaker 1: So basically car comes to stops on the side of the road.

806
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,297
Speaker 1: I miraculously avoided hitting anything.

807
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:07,646
Speaker 1: And right about then is when she woke up screaming.

808
00:42:07,968 --> 00:42:10,217
Speaker 1: No, but yeah, I didn't hit anything.

809
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:10,900
Speaker 1: I survived.

810
00:42:12,142 --> 00:42:12,503
Speaker 0: All right.

811
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:13,910
Speaker 0: Have you ever gotten caught?

812
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:14,895
Speaker 0: Could be doing anything.

813
00:42:14,915 --> 00:42:15,960
Speaker 0: Not yet.

814
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:23,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, uh, I had some close calls, but the police have never actually physically gotten.

815
00:42:23,604 --> 00:42:25,432
Speaker 0: I guess I've gotten caught speeding.

816
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:26,436
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

817
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:27,220
Speaker 1: A couple of times.

818
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:32,519
Speaker 1: Uh, you have to, yeah, I've only ever gotten two speeding tickets in my whole life.

819
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,082
Speaker 1: Yeah.

820
00:42:33,122 --> 00:42:33,947
Speaker 1: Three, three, three.

821
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:34,530
Speaker 1: I forgot about.

822
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,093
Speaker 0: So we're tied.

823
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:37,646
Speaker 0: I guess I've been pulled over like 12 times though.

824
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:38,349
Speaker 0: I've never been.

825
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:39,433
Speaker 0: I've all, uh, all right.

826
00:42:39,453 --> 00:42:39,714
Speaker 0: That's it.

827
00:42:40,076 --> 00:42:44,899
Speaker 1: Well, I've run away from the police a lot in various instances where the statute of limitations is clearly up.

828
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:45,742
Speaker 0: Yeah.

829
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:46,164
Speaker 0: Yeah.

830
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:46,907
Speaker 0: All right.

831
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:49,839
Speaker 0: Did Scott ever find a pair of shoes to match a sundress?

832
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,225
Speaker 0: Well, I don't have a sundress.

833
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:54,240
Speaker 1: That's why he's having so much trouble finding a pair of shoes to match it.

834
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:57,274
Speaker 1: Why we took so long to get out of that stupid mall in Baltimore.

835
00:42:57,294 --> 00:42:57,656
Speaker 0: All right.

836
00:42:57,757 --> 00:42:59,884
Speaker 0: What are some of your favorite comedians?

837
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:02,091
Speaker 1: Louis black, Stephen, right.

838
00:43:02,753 --> 00:43:05,781
Speaker 1: Uh, George Carlin before he got extra angry and old.

839
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,083
Speaker 1: I like Seinfeld a lot.

840
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:09,407
Speaker 0: Uh, uh, Dennis Leary.

841
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:10,088
Speaker 0: Yeah.

842
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:14,656
Speaker 1: Um, uh, you know, it's weird.

843
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:18,503
Speaker 1: I Eddie Izzard.

844
00:43:18,604 --> 00:43:19,066
Speaker 1: Yeah.

845
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:19,789
Speaker 0: Monty Python.

846
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:20,291
Speaker 0: The whole group.

847
00:43:20,492 --> 00:43:20,632
Speaker 0: Yeah.

848
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:22,138
Speaker 1: Eddie Izzard is particularly great.

849
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:22,520
Speaker 0: Yep.

850
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:23,822
Speaker 1: I don't know.

851
00:43:23,842 --> 00:43:25,250
Speaker 1: I like a lot of standup comedians.

852
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:25,994
Speaker 1: It's really hard.

853
00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:31,277
Speaker 0: It's hard to find a bad, I mean, you know, pretty much anyone that's famous is probably funny.

854
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:33,102
Speaker 0: Otherwise they wouldn't have gotten famous.

855
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:34,365
Speaker 1: Yeah.

856
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:38,032
Speaker 0: Uh, all right.

857
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:42,764
Speaker 0: Uh, what do you think about long distance relationships?

858
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:43,467
Speaker 0: I don't know.

859
00:43:43,547 --> 00:43:44,371
Speaker 0: Thing isn't a verb.

860
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:45,054
Speaker 0: This is very hard.

861
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:45,637
Speaker 1: Yeah.

862
00:43:45,878 --> 00:43:47,042
Speaker 1: I don't think we can answer that one.

863
00:43:48,707 --> 00:43:49,108
Speaker 1: I don't know.

864
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:53,922
Speaker 1: I've seen some people who are in really stupid ones and I often wondered why.

865
00:43:53,942 --> 00:43:59,504
Speaker 1: sometimes I ask these people why, but at the same time I was in one off and on for a while and you know what?

866
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:00,911
Speaker 1: It worked out pretty well in the end.

867
00:44:01,253 --> 00:44:07,744
Speaker 0: I mean, I see some people and it's just sort of like they meet someone on the internet or something and they decide they're in a relationship.

868
00:44:07,804 --> 00:44:10,417
Speaker 0: I guess on paper they say, yeah, that's my girlfriend.

869
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:10,940
Speaker 0: That's my boyfriend.

870
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,413
Speaker 1: That's just like when you're in second grade and yeah, we're dating now.

871
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:13,997
Speaker 1: We're go.

872
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:20,447
Speaker 1: or in middle school when people didn't go on dates, but they went out, which meant they were dating, but they don't actually go on dates.

873
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:22,740
Speaker 0: They just went out, but they don't have a real relationship.

874
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:35,711
Speaker 0: So, but I see other people where they do have a real relationship and then eventually like they come together or maybe they were together and now they're apart, but they use long distance to sort of keep it together and then they come back together again.

875
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:41,215
Speaker 0: I guess it's like long distance is okay as long as it's not long distance forever, you know?

876
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:42,983
Speaker 0: Cause it's like a long distance relationship.

877
00:44:43,123 --> 00:44:51,480
Speaker 0: Either if it starts long distance, it's probably just going to end long distance, but I feel like if it starts together or ends together, then it's, it's okay.

878
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:54,337
Speaker 1: I do have one piece of advice for all our listeners out there.

879
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:55,743
Speaker 1: I know we have a lot of high school listeners.

880
00:44:56,666 --> 00:45:04,134
Speaker 1: Um, if you go to college, first of all, you're high school, you can't really pick your friends because you're limited to the geographic area.

881
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:14,614
Speaker 1: Part of the reason you go to college is that now you have kind of self-selected a great, you have a group of people who are self-selected to have somewhat similar interests to be at the same school.

882
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:20,815
Speaker 1: And you're more likely to meet people you're actually going to want to be in a relationship with.

883
00:45:21,316 --> 00:45:31,395
Speaker 1: So my general advice to everyone out there is if you're dating someone in high school, long distance or short, and you go to college, do not try to hold onto that relationship.

884
00:45:31,455 --> 00:45:32,539
Speaker 1: It's totally not worth it.

885
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:33,443
Speaker 1: It's not going to work.

886
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:52,023
Speaker 0: Well, I guess what I'm trying to say is you, maybe your relationship can still work depending, but whatever you do, do not pick a college to go to or pick, just don't make a decision about what you're going to do with the rest of your life based on the relationship you may have in high school.

887
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:58,512
Speaker 0: Like for example, if the person you're in a relationship with says they're going to school X, don't go to school X because they're going there.

888
00:45:58,994 --> 00:46:03,012
Speaker 0: Don't even take them into consideration when deciding what you're going to do with the rest of your life.

889
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:04,560
Speaker 0: That's what you have to do.

890
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:06,547
Speaker 0: The relationship might work.

891
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:12,169
Speaker 0: Plenty of people are married happily to their high school sweethearts or whatever because it worked out that way.

892
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,237
Speaker 0: But don't decide your college.

893
00:46:14,277 --> 00:46:15,381
Speaker 0: Don't decide your job.

894
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:19,153
Speaker 0: Don't bet your future on your high school girlfriend or boyfriend.

895
00:46:20,116 --> 00:46:32,258
Speaker 1: Now, right along those lines, if you go to college and you were dating someone who stayed in your hometown or went somewhere else, odds are you're going to meet better people in your college.

896
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:36,492
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not 100% true, but I'm just giving, I'm warning you, you're going to meet better people.

897
00:46:37,957 --> 00:46:44,623
Speaker 1: Don't forgo what you might, what might be better for you for a lame high school relationship that's going to end poorly anyway.

898
00:46:44,964 --> 00:46:45,145
Speaker 0: Yep.

899
00:46:45,165 --> 00:46:45,968
Speaker 0: All right.

900
00:46:45,988 --> 00:46:46,991
Speaker 1: You want to read this next one?

901
00:46:47,352 --> 00:46:47,794
Speaker 0: Good God.

902
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:48,316
Speaker 0: Okay.

903
00:46:48,496 --> 00:46:48,878
Speaker 1: Skip it.

904
00:46:49,219 --> 00:46:50,323
Speaker 0: How about this German Scott?

905
00:46:50,384 --> 00:46:54,400
Speaker 0: Why are you so abnormal to unable to enjoy a damn grilled cheese sandwich?

906
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,428
Speaker 0: Why do you have your fancy cheeses?

907
00:46:56,448 --> 00:46:58,257
Speaker 0: Why do you throw fruity as herbs on them?

908
00:46:58,297 --> 00:47:00,669
Speaker 0: Why can't be normal people enjoy grilled cheese sandwich?

909
00:47:00,749 --> 00:47:01,653
Speaker 0: It's American classic.

910
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,940
Speaker 0: Why do you hate America so much?

911
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,036
Speaker 0: Why can't you eat a regular grilled cheese sandwich and can be happy?

912
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:07,840
Speaker 0: What the hell people?

913
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,436
Speaker 0: Well, I just want to say rim is the one who can't eat a plain grilled cheese sandwich.

914
00:47:11,536 --> 00:47:13,225
Speaker 0: I prefer the plain grilled cheese sandwich.

915
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:14,291
Speaker 0: See, here's the thing.

916
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:15,980
Speaker 0: As long as it's nicely toasted and buttered.

917
00:47:16,361 --> 00:47:22,869
Speaker 1: If I'm making a grilled cheese sandwich and I know how to make it better and taste better, why not make it taste better?

918
00:47:22,889 --> 00:47:25,544
Speaker 0: Because you're making it taste different, not better, but it tastes better.

919
00:47:25,585 --> 00:47:26,047
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

920
00:47:26,227 --> 00:47:28,076
Speaker 1: It's got people like different things.

921
00:47:28,317 --> 00:47:28,678
Speaker 0: Yeah.

922
00:47:28,718 --> 00:47:29,521
Speaker 0: Some people are bad.

923
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:30,846
Speaker 1: Okay.

924
00:47:31,347 --> 00:47:31,648
Speaker 0: Okay.

925
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:32,391
Speaker 0: It's a bad taste.

926
00:47:32,752 --> 00:47:33,936
Speaker 1: I mean, I just I like.

927
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:38,370
Speaker 1: why would I make a grilled cheese sandwich with American cheese if I can have some moderate jack?

928
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:42,284
Speaker 0: Uh, because it does not good for grilled cheese.

929
00:47:42,384 --> 00:47:45,299
Speaker 1: Actually, moderate jack is probably the best cheese for grilled cheese sandwich.

930
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,883
Speaker 1: It melts the exact right amount.

931
00:47:47,404 --> 00:47:55,403
Speaker 0: Anyway, mostly messing with you, but honestly, why can't you enjoy just fine?

932
00:47:55,443 --> 00:47:55,805
Speaker 0: Rim can't.

933
00:47:56,366 --> 00:47:57,049
Speaker 1: Uh, I can.

934
00:47:57,069 --> 00:47:58,213
Speaker 1: It's just some things taste better.

935
00:47:58,514 --> 00:48:06,142
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember when I went to this hors d'oeuvre thing at the yacht club with Emily in the city, and I saw a bunch of cheese.

936
00:48:06,323 --> 00:48:08,254
Speaker 1: and I look and I go, Oh, I know all those cheeses.

937
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:09,481
Speaker 1: Then I get over there and I eat one.

938
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,092
Speaker 1: It tastes really good, like better than I expected.

939
00:48:12,112 --> 00:48:17,055
Speaker 1: Then I look and there's a little sign and it says the name of the cheese, and it's not the name I expected.

940
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:18,040
Speaker 1: It was some different cheese.

941
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:24,057
Speaker 1: Then I learned that every kind of cheese has a richer, better equivalent.

942
00:48:24,077 --> 00:48:25,020
Speaker 1: that does taste better.

943
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,533
Speaker 1: However, however, while it did taste better, I ate this cheese.

944
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:33,849
Speaker 1: I thought, wow, this tastes 10 times better than the normal equivalent of this kind of cheese.

945
00:48:34,914 --> 00:48:36,260
Speaker 1: I know how much that cheese costs.

946
00:48:37,021 --> 00:48:40,152
Speaker 1: It is not worth that much money for me to eat that cheese.

947
00:48:40,213 --> 00:48:45,974
Speaker 1: I would never buy that cheese because it's way too much money for what little better it is, but it is better.

948
00:48:46,074 --> 00:48:50,651
Speaker 1: So if someone gives it to me, I'm going to eat it in general.

949
00:48:50,852 --> 00:48:54,849
Speaker 0: I think that, you know, there are things in this world and it's all about perception.

950
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:57,099
Speaker 0: It's like some things are perceived to be fancified.

951
00:48:57,139 --> 00:49:02,583
Speaker 0: I mean, what if, you know, Jack cheese was like the default cheese instead of American cheese being the default cheese.

952
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:11,478
Speaker 0: It's only a matter of, you know, human perception, marketing, culture and society that dictates, you know, what's stupidly fancified and what's not.

953
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:17,661
Speaker 1: If you're in the poor part of Ethiopia, a plain grilled cheese sandwich is like hoity toity food that you're not going to get.

954
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:30,526
Speaker 0: And, you know, in reality, stuff that costs more like the fancy cheeses at that place, you know, at the yacht club, they probably taste better on average is the reason they're so expensive and sought after.

955
00:49:30,586 --> 00:49:33,602
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's for bullshit reasons, but sometimes it's for real reasons.

956
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:42,320
Speaker 0: And in general, some things are stupidly fancified because there's a reason for it, because they actually are better and rare and more difficult and more expensive, like foie gras.

957
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:44,988
Speaker 0: And it tastes really good.

958
00:49:45,088 --> 00:49:50,306
Speaker 0: And some things are stupidly fancified, but they don't actually taste very good at all.

959
00:49:50,366 --> 00:49:51,409
Speaker 0: Like champagne.

960
00:49:51,911 --> 00:49:52,814
Speaker 1: Well, I'll put it this way.

961
00:49:53,415 --> 00:49:56,771
Speaker 1: Very expensive champagne is very good.

962
00:49:57,913 --> 00:50:02,358
Speaker 1: Very cheap champagne is also very good.

963
00:50:02,578 --> 00:50:07,434
Speaker 1: You want to avoid moderately priced champagne and you never want to buy expensive champagne.

964
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:09,183
Speaker 1: You want it to be given to you by someone else.

965
00:50:09,564 --> 00:50:11,212
Speaker 1: Never turn down fancy champagne.

966
00:50:11,253 --> 00:50:14,665
Speaker 1: But if you're buying champagne for your wedding, cheaper will taste better.

967
00:50:14,685 --> 00:50:15,409
Speaker 1: No one will know.

968
00:50:15,469 --> 00:50:17,117
Speaker 1: Get the cheapest champagne you can.

969
00:50:17,197 --> 00:50:18,423
Speaker 1: It'll taste so much better.

970
00:50:18,543 --> 00:50:19,729
Speaker 0: And a bottle will explode better.

971
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:20,111
Speaker 0: Go poof.

972
00:50:20,673 --> 00:50:22,441
Speaker 1: Actually, if it explodes, then you did it wrong.

973
00:50:22,803 --> 00:50:23,064
Speaker 0: I know.

974
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:26,360
Speaker 0: But if you're supposed to party, you're supposed to make it explode for fun.

975
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,081
Speaker 1: Damn.

976
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:29,325
Speaker 1: Now I'm hungry again.

977
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:31,593
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to go eat some Chinese.

978
00:50:31,673 --> 00:50:33,680
Speaker 1: That is not a question.

979
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:34,642
Speaker 1: All right.

980
00:50:34,682 --> 00:50:36,069
Speaker 1: We've gone on for about an hour.

981
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:39,629
Speaker 1: I think we should answer one or two more and you don't want to do the whole thing.

982
00:50:39,649 --> 00:50:41,260
Speaker 0: I thought we were gonna do the whole thing and just split it up.

983
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:42,244
Speaker 0: All right.

984
00:50:42,264 --> 00:50:42,987
Speaker 0: Let's do one more then.

985
00:50:43,649 --> 00:50:45,415
Speaker 0: Where is the forum thread for Episode 071011?

986
00:50:45,415 --> 00:50:51,356
Speaker 0: Well, it requires extra effort to make the forum threads for those episodes.

987
00:50:51,376 --> 00:50:54,350
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, some things are automatic and some things are manual labor.

988
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:57,967
Speaker 0: So sometimes you don't do the manual labor and a forum thread doesn't happen.

989
00:50:58,007 --> 00:50:59,754
Speaker 0: If you want one, go make one.

990
00:51:00,055 --> 00:51:00,778
Speaker 0: No one's stopping you.

991
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,541
Speaker 1: All right.

992
00:51:01,581 --> 00:51:01,942
Speaker 1: Great.

993
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:04,148
Speaker 1: And we'll end on that anticlimax.

994
00:51:04,288 --> 00:51:04,569
Speaker 0: Yes.

995
00:51:05,572 --> 00:51:14,641
Speaker 1: Luckily, we have another hour or so of these questions left, so there will probably be a third questions day at some point in the future.

996
00:51:16,928 --> 00:51:18,933
Speaker 1: I enjoy doing this, so I'm not really going to complain.

997
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:21,200
Speaker 0: No, but it's almost interminable.

998
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,688
Speaker 1: I see some questions in the future.

999
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:26,348
Speaker 0: By the time the three questions episodes will be out, we'll be taking new questions next year.

1000
00:51:26,368 --> 00:51:28,799
Speaker 1: I see a bunch of interesting questions coming up.

1001
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,261
Speaker 1: All right.

1002
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:30,643
Speaker 1: We'll have to save those for the future.

1003
00:51:30,884 --> 00:51:31,184
Speaker 0: Okay.

1004
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,843
