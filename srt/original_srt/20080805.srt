1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,124
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, August 5th.

2
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:11,966
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:12,828
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:14,491
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:18,539
Speaker 0: Tonight, DS, Homebrews, and ROMS.

6
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,800
Speaker 1: Well, hello, Kineticon, or at least all the people who came to the Geek Nights fold after seeing us at Kineticon.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, Kineticon wasn't that big.

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,500
Speaker 0: I guess it had more people than last year, at least it felt like it did.

10
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:49,760
Speaker 1: It's hard to say because Friday was real weak, but then Saturday busted out more so than I would have imagined.

11
00:00:50,801 --> 00:01:03,120
Speaker 0: But this Kineticon, more so than any con before, really felt like we had a big connection with our existing listeners, as well as people who became fans of us at the con, or at least as far as I could tell.

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,407
Speaker 1: Well, I think what happened was, I mean, a lot of you probably came to that 8 a.m.

13
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:22,680
Speaker 1: match game and discovered- Yeah, but because we didn't actually run the match game, well, we did, kind of, but we basically just kind of hung out at the front of the room for two hours.

14
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:27,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they're not going to give us celebrity guests.

15
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,320
Speaker 0: A match game can only be an hour, really.

16
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,900
Speaker 1: Granted, had we known we weren't going to have guests, we might have had something more ready to go than we did.

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,804
Speaker 0: Well, I would have rescheduled.

18
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:38,647
Speaker 0: I would have changed it.

19
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:40,012
Speaker 0: I would have had it not be a match game.

20
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,320
Speaker 0: I would have done something else, and I would have only done it for an hour.

21
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:53,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I can say one thing, it must have worked well, because pretty much every panel throughout the day had a bunch of people who went to the previous panel, and then some new people.

22
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:05,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, at every panel I announced what our remaining panels were, and people seemed to actually pay attention, and I guess they wrote it down or circled it on their schedules or something, because I saw the same faces many times throughout the day.

23
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:10,995
Speaker 1: Now, before we go any further, I do want to point out, because I'm sure many of you, you know, you went home, you went, "Oh yeah, that Geek Nights thing,".

24
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,000
Speaker 1: and now you're listening to this, the most recent episode.

25
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,486
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is four nights a week, and this is Geek Nights Tuesdays.

26
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:25,880
Speaker 1: So, you know, Mondays, Science Tech, Tuesday, gaming, which a lot of you are probably here for the gaming after the Burning Wheel events.

27
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:26,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was great.

28
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:34,760
Speaker 1: But many of you are probably here for Geek Nights Wednesdays, Anime Manga Comics, so stay tuned tomorrow night when we'll have our actual coverage of Kineticon.

29
00:02:36,443 --> 00:02:38,254
Speaker 1: And Geek Nights Thursdays, we talk about whatever.

30
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:39,200
Speaker 1: That's kind of the fun time.

31
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:45,500
Speaker 0: It's kind of weird, though, to do the Kineticon coverage tomorrow, because most of the con was gaming action.

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,100
Speaker 1: I know.

33
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:57,580
Speaker 1: But anyway, the other thing is that Geek Nights is four nights a week, but this summer we're currently on our sabbatical schedule, so we're actually doing, like, one week Monday-Wednesday, the other week Tuesday-Thursday.

34
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:01,208
Speaker 1: So basically, it's four separate shows, and they update.

35
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,753
Speaker 1: You can look at the feeds on the website, figure them all out.

36
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:06,760
Speaker 1: If you got this far, you probably know how podcasts work.

37
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this week we're going to do a Tuesday-Wednesday, just a little bit weird, because the way the conventions are.

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,160
Speaker 0: Yes, also- After, in September, things should return to normal.

39
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:16,702
Speaker 0: Yes.

40
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:23,040
Speaker 1: Now, these might be slightly atypical episodes, too, just tonight and tomorrow, because one, we were at Kineticon last weekend.

41
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:31,540
Speaker 1: Two, tomorrow night we were packing up, and then Thursday morning we're driving to Baltimore for Oticon, where we were doing another five panels.

42
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:45,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you want to listen to some more typical, run-of-the-mill Geek Nights episodes, go back a few weeks, a few months, maybe go on the site and search for a topic that interests you, or check the categories on the left.

43
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,664
Speaker 0: Maybe you'll find something you like.

44
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:53,000
Speaker 0: Listen to a show about something that you already enjoy, and then you'll know if this is a show you want to listen to.

45
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:09,520
Speaker 1: But to not continually tick off all the existing listeners with every time we go to Oticon, we talk about- Yeah, and granted, at least from what I saw at Kineticon, it was surprising that- It's like making a guy who's beaten the game sit through the tutorial.

46
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,180
Speaker 1: But I got to say, an anime you should see, that's usually an event where we don't expect our existing listeners to go to it, because they know what we're going to say.

47
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,365
Speaker 1: But there were a lot of you in that audience.

48
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:28,180
Speaker 1: I guess we've done big con things, but we haven't done big con things as Geek Nights.

49
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,844
Speaker 1: We've kind of been doing these panels.

50
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:31,147
Speaker 1: that's just, "Yeah, we do this panel,".

51
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:36,080
Speaker 1: but this time, the first time, we were like, "Hey, we are Geek Nights," and there's a lot of you out there.

52
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,520
Speaker 1: It's kind of scary to see that many fans in one place.

53
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like some people are forum listeners, but there are people who just listen, and they went to the con.

54
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,260
Speaker 0: In fact, almost everyone- They never went in the forum or emailed us or anything.

55
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,115
Speaker 1: Almost every person who came up to us was like, "Oh my god, I listen.

56
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:52,778
Speaker 1: I've been listening for

57
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:53,160
Speaker 1: years.".

58
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:54,468
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Yeah, so who are you in the

59
00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:54,729
Speaker 1: forum?".

60
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:56,017
Speaker 1: They're like, "Uh, I don't post in the

61
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:56,339
Speaker 1: forum.".

62
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:57,005
Speaker 0: Yeah.

63
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:58,340
Speaker 0: Oh, anyway.

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:13,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the one thing I got to say is it was something else to be- it's our last panel of the night, the Beyond Dungeons and Dragons, which, by the way, for all you new listeners, we are doing that exact same panel, only for real, at the Penny Arcade Expo.

65
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Speaker 0: I don't see how the one we didn't do wasn't real.

66
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:18,360
Speaker 0: Well, it'll be- And the one we did already wasn't real.

67
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,519
Speaker 1: It'll be for a much larger audience, I guess.

68
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, other than that, it'll be mostly the same.

69
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:23,642
Speaker 1: Mostly the same.

70
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:28,414
Speaker 1: I'm going to have a better example than a hammer and a nail versus a hammer and a bust.

71
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,397
Speaker 1: that's Seinfeld.

72
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:30,540
Speaker 1: I don't know where I was going with that.

73
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,765
Speaker 1: But, yeah, we're doing that at the Penny Arcade Expo.

74
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:42,320
Speaker 1: I highly recommend, if you happen to be going to the Penny Arcade Expo at the end of the month, or I guess the beginning of next month, the end of the month.

75
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's Labor Day weekend.

76
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,561
Speaker 0: Yes.

77
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:52,693
Speaker 1: And Saturday, August 30th, from 6 to 7 in Satellite Theater Room 307.

78
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:56,840
Speaker 1: Anyway, but it was something to, you know, the panel before us is running out of the lake.

79
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,784
Speaker 0: I hope that, if it's Saturday night, I hope it doesn't conflict.

80
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:06,180
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm going to this con and I'm doing one panel, so really, most of the other time there, I'm going to be trying to enjoy the con, and I got some things I want to do.

81
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,023
Speaker 0: I want to go to the opening keynote.

82
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:09,806
Speaker 0: I want to go to the concert.

83
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:13,812
Speaker 0: I want to go to, you know, Gabe Draws, Hot Dog Fairy.

84
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:16,196
Speaker 0: Maybe I want to see the Omega-thon final.

85
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,820
Speaker 0: You know, there are certain things that happen at PAX that I want to do.

86
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,875
Speaker 0: I hope Saturday night that our panel doesn't conflict with, say, a concert or something.

87
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,420
Speaker 0: That would suck the ass.

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,114
Speaker 1: I haven't looked at all, but anyway, it was, you know, we go in the room and the person before us is going a little long, and we're, you know, in the room like, "All right, what are we doing?

89
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:32,896
Speaker 1: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

90
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:33,858
Speaker 1: Laptop out, getting

91
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:34,159
Speaker 1: ready.".

92
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:41,020
Speaker 1: And then we walk outside the room to see the situation and to see all of you people lined up all the way down the hallway.

93
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like we had a line and the panel that was in there had five people, and they were giving us guff.

94
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,693
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Look, we got like a hundred people.

95
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:47,736
Speaker 0: You got like five people.

96
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:49,199
Speaker 0: You can just stop your panel.

97
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:49,380
Speaker 0: No

98
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,480
Speaker 0: one.".

99
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:56,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the other shout out I want to give is that, you know, Alex was doing Birding Wheel demos for pretty much the entire time.

100
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,542
Speaker 0: And he got mad bored.

101
00:06:57,602 --> 00:07:02,073
Speaker 0: Well, he didn't get mad bored, but he was a little, "Eh," because he only brought the sword.

102
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:03,556
Speaker 0: He didn't bring any other scenarios.

103
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,100
Speaker 0: He was doing the same thing over and over again.

104
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,800
Speaker 1: But at the same time, every sword went completely different.

105
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:09,186
Speaker 0: I ran a sword.

106
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:10,311
Speaker 0: Everyone was amicable.

107
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:11,296
Speaker 0: I was like, "What the fuck?

108
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:11,717
Speaker 0: Why are we

109
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,200
Speaker 0: amicable?".

110
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,300
Speaker 1: He ran one at the same time, and like everyone drew swords within about 30 seconds.

111
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:20,160
Speaker 0: I got some plans the next time I played the sword.

112
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,740
Speaker 1: I got to say, though, the elf was doing surprisingly well overall.

113
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:25,922
Speaker 0: I don't know.

114
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:28,520
Speaker 0: I thought I heard that like all the elves got chumped except for one.

115
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,711
Speaker 1: Well, one elf went out in a blaze of glory.

116
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:32,440
Speaker 0: I think that counts.

117
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,080
Speaker 0: Well, there was a rat that got set on fire, right?

118
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,864
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was also a blaze of glory.

119
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:47,179
Speaker 1: But to all of you who played Birding Wheel games at Kineticon because you saw our panel or you heard us talking about it, I hope you're listening because we talk about Burning Wheel kind of often now.

120
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,319
Speaker 0: Go to burningwheel.com.

121
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also, Luke Crane, just in case, he's going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo.

122
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,760
Speaker 0: Is he really?

123
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,240
Speaker 0: Yes.

124
00:07:55,922 --> 00:08:02,714
Speaker 1: In fact, we're probably going to take the crowd, if we can, from the Beyond Dungeons & Dragons panel directly to Mr.

125
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:05,839
Speaker 1: Luke Crane, who will probably run a demo.

126
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,900
Speaker 0: So he did confirm he was going to be there?

127
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,281
Speaker 0: Yes.

128
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:12,119
Speaker 1: I told him, "Yeah, Kineticon, blah, blah, blah, panel," and he basically said, "Hot

129
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:12,300
Speaker 1: shit.".

130
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,340
Speaker 0: All right.

131
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,219
Speaker 1: So, yeah, Kineticon coverage will be tomorrow night.

132
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,658
Speaker 0: Dun, dun, dun.

133
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,219
Speaker 1: Dun, dun, dun, dun.

134
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,080
Speaker 1: So, yeah, we got any video game news here?

135
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,949
Speaker 0: You want to go News Time?

136
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,678
Speaker 0: All right, here we go.

137
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,323
Speaker 0: Check this out.

138
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:32,360
Speaker 0: So people have been talking, you know, the Virtual Console has been a little weak lately.

139
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:36,198
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of companies said, "Oh, yeah, our games are coming out of the Virtual

140
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:36,500
Speaker 0: Console.".

141
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,020
Speaker 0: You know what came out of the Virtual Console?

142
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,200
Speaker 1: What came out of the Virtual Console?

143
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,515
Speaker 0: I think it was like Splatterhouse 2.

144
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:42,220
Speaker 0: Not too bad.

145
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,059
Speaker 1: Hey, Splatterhouse 3 is where it's at.

146
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,521
Speaker 0: It might have been 3.

147
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:44,943
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

148
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:50,540
Speaker 0: One of the Splatterhouses and the Sega Master System Sonic the Hedgehog.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,105
Speaker 1: Whoa.

150
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:52,337
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty bad.

151
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,900
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's been pretty weak over there.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,223
Speaker 0: And then, like, the WiiWare.

153
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:59,412
Speaker 0: I mean, some of the WiiWares were good, like, you know, the Dr.

154
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:02,420
Speaker 0: Mario and the Lost Winds, you know.

155
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,240
Speaker 0: But they put out a lot of their heavy hitters right away, and now they're bringing out the weak sauce.

156
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:16,300
Speaker 0: But next week, the word on the street is that the WiiWare game is going to be Strong Bad.

157
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:18,502
Speaker 1: Ah.

158
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:26,400
Speaker 1: Now, I imagine that this is going to be much like the Penny Arcade game, where the game will probably be alright, but it'll be carried primarily by theme.

159
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,721
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

160
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:36,020
Speaker 0: But, I mean, the thing is, even when, you know, the Homestar guys were doing their vid-electrics, making, like, the Trogdor game and such.

161
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:39,480
Speaker 0: Those games that they made were actually not bad.

162
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,480
Speaker 1: You know, they were better than the average Flash game you play online for five minutes.

163
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,863
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

164
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:51,820
Speaker 0: So, if they make a whole, if they put their resources into making an entire game worth, this could be something worth paying.

165
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,408
Speaker 0: I mean, I haven't paid attention to Homestar in years, you know.

166
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,180
Speaker 0: It sort of became the same joke over and over and lost its funny.

167
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,120
Speaker 1: Kind of like, or at least to us, kind of like the, uh, the Ask A Ninja.

168
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like that's- I almost said the Ninja Consultant.

169
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:04,873
Speaker 1: I'm like, "No, that's not it.

170
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:05,658
Speaker 1: That's completely

171
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:05,980
Speaker 1: different.".

172
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,595
Speaker 0: No, but Ask A Ninja, you know, it's like, "I look forward to killing you

173
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:09,199
Speaker 0: soon.".

174
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:17,000
Speaker 0: And it's like, okay, it was funny a whole bunch of times, but then, eventually, it's sort of the same thing over and over again, and I no longer laughed at it.

175
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,288
Speaker 0: And Homestar was the same way, but maybe I'll check this out.

176
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:23,536
Speaker 0: I think it's going to be on PC also, so maybe I'll check the PC action.

177
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:23,877
Speaker 0: I don't know.

178
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:24,699
Speaker 0: I'll think about it.

179
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:32,800
Speaker 0: But yeah, you should, if you got WiiWare, you might be wanting to consider getting this, even if you're not a Homestar fan.

180
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:35,027
Speaker 1: I remember the time I got WiiWare.

181
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,580
Speaker 1: It all started when I drank 48 glasses of marinade.

182
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,300
Speaker 0: Because if you don't, your Wii might lie dormant for quite a while.

183
00:10:44,400 --> 00:11:01,500
Speaker 1: You know, I love the Wii, and the thing is, though, the DS has been my primary console pretty much since it came out, and nothing- The only thing that distracted me from the DS for any length of time was when I got Civ 4, and for the two days after Team Fortress 2 came out before I solved it.

184
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:04,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I said it before on the show, I'll say it again.

185
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:10,820
Speaker 0: It's like, I read comics, I read books, I watch anime, now my iPhone, right?

186
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:14,830
Speaker 0: I play Wii, I do all sorts of geeky things.

187
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,014
Speaker 0: I have a queue of geeky things.

188
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:18,140
Speaker 0: I program stuff, right, on my laptop.

189
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:24,513
Speaker 0: If there's a DS game that's good, everything else takes a back burner.

190
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:37,380
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is about the DS, but it's just- My brain will always have me go for an unplayed, good DS game before anything else, and you're gonna see why that tendency is incredibly dangerous when we get to the real part of the show.

191
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:47,880
Speaker 1: Well, you see, I think what that is, I think that is misplaced game desire from the fa- I mean, back before we were in the real world, you know, when we were in college.

192
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,376
Speaker 1: As in, infinite free time, zero responsibility, no money, so we couldn't go anywhere anyway.

193
00:11:54,396 --> 00:11:55,620
Speaker 1: It's not like I commuted.

194
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,784
Speaker 1: So, I'd wanna play games.

195
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,394
Speaker 1: I would just sit down in front of a console in our house and play games.

196
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:06,340
Speaker 1: I would sit down and play a game, like, all the way through.

197
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,026
Speaker 1: But now I don't have time for that.

198
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:10,880
Speaker 1: I mean, I get home and I gotta do the podcast, I gotta, you know, eat.

199
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:19,320
Speaker 0: See, it's weird, 'cause if a really good Wii game comes out, like a Twilight Princess or a Metroid or something like that, I do sit down and play the whole thing.

200
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:22,310
Speaker 0: It happens, you know, I come home every day and play it.

201
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,300
Speaker 0: But there hasn't been a game like that, really.

202
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:33,700
Speaker 1: Well, see, the other thing is, you get home, your schedule's a little different from mine, and getting up at like 4.30 in the morning really puts a damper on playing games at home when I could be outside.

203
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,960
Speaker 1: Of course, you know, it is also summer.

204
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,973
Speaker 0: It is summer, but you know what, we always say, "Oh, in winter we're gonna play so many

205
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:40,274
Speaker 0: games.".

206
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:41,680
Speaker 0: Then in winter we don't play any games.

207
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:43,626
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were reasons for that.

208
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:47,220
Speaker 1: I mean, we were, the show, we were really kinda doing a lot of Geek Night's work last winter.

209
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:49,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, alright, we'll see what happens.

210
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,680
Speaker 1: It's alright.

211
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:57,740
Speaker 1: I feel as though it is not the DS that is causing the desire to play games, the exclusion of all else.

212
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:06,140
Speaker 1: It is the fact that because we, in particular, have a long commute and aren't home that often, the DS is always there and there's nothing else to distract.

213
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,780
Speaker 1: I mean, think, when you're on the train, I got my laptop.

214
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Speaker 0: But I mean, even if I get a new DS game, like when I got Professor Layton, right?

215
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:17,940
Speaker 0: I would wake up, get on the train, not even listen to my typical morning podcast and play Professor Layton.

216
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:19,503
Speaker 0: I would get to work.

217
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:24,640
Speaker 0: As soon as I walked out the office door, I'd turn it on and play it on my way to the subway, on the subway, on the train.

218
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,420
Speaker 1: But see, it's the same thing for me.

219
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,200
Speaker 0: I got home, I would get home, we would do the show, I would get in bed and play Professor Layton until it was beaten.

220
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,140
Speaker 0: As soon as it was beaten, I put it down.

221
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,582
Speaker 1: But wait, wait, wait.

222
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:34,771
Speaker 1: For me, it's the same thing with anything I get into.

223
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,800
Speaker 1: that's good that I can do portably.

224
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,385
Speaker 1: So when I was watching Bocorato, you know, right?

225
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:46,740
Speaker 1: I would pretty much get off of work, run to the train, sit down, start watching, skipping openers and closers, watch as much as I could.

226
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,667
Speaker 0: But I only really do it for DS games.

227
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,640
Speaker 0: I guess I did it for The Prince of Nothing also, but I only really do it for DS games.

228
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,820
Speaker 0: Like, even if I have an amazing anime, I won't do it.

229
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,700
Speaker 1: You said not a few days ago you were doing it a little bit for Evangelion when you were relaunching it.

230
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I wasn't watching Evangelion at home.

231
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:05,928
Speaker 0: It was only on the train only.

232
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,112
Speaker 0: Not home.

233
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:10,160
Speaker 0: It wasn't as strong as a DS game is.

234
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:16,300
Speaker 1: Plus, you don't have the ultra immersion of Civ 4 destroying your life like I do right now.

235
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,860
Speaker 0: I was playing the Civ Revelation Revolutions.

236
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, Civ Revolutions is a different game.

237
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:21,900
Speaker 0: It is a different game.

238
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,724
Speaker 1: I'd say it's a completely different game.

239
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:30,240
Speaker 1: Now, they're very similar, and I'm not saying that one is more fun than the other one, but Civ 4 is definitely not the same game.

240
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,859
Speaker 0: No, I didn't say they were the same game.

241
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:35,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I actually have been feeling the Civ 4 drive madly.

242
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,027
Speaker 1: But I gotta talk a little bit about it.

243
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,260
Speaker 1: Now, we talked not too long ago about this.

244
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,400
Speaker 1: Diablo 3 is coming out, and all the fans of Diablo, basically...

245
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,930
Speaker 0: You're not doing the news we have to do?

246
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,319
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have to do another news.

247
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,783
Speaker 1: Oh no, we'll get to that.

248
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:56,260
Speaker 1: I gotta talk about this, because there's some screenshots, and this epitomizes everything I hate about the internet.

249
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:07,599
Speaker 1: So people saw what Diablo 3 is gonna look like, and people who have never played Diablo before, because they're either younger than us, or smarter than everyone who played Diablo back when it came out...

250
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:10,148
Speaker 0: Well, they're not smart.

251
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,680
Speaker 0: I mean, never having played Diablo doesn't make you smart.

252
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,539
Speaker 1: I think it does.

253
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,559
Speaker 0: Never going to play Diablo makes you smart.

254
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,446
Speaker 1: But they saw, "Oh, Diablo.

255
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:19,752
Speaker 1: Oh, it's based on some old game.

256
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:21,037
Speaker 1: Oh, it looks like, wow, the

257
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:21,278
Speaker 1: end.".

258
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,576
Speaker 1: But people who had played the old Diablos looked at it and said, "Wow, those graphics are way too good.

259
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:27,138
Speaker 1: Fuck

260
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:27,378
Speaker 1: them.".

261
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:28,379
Speaker 1: Yeah.

262
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,320
Speaker 1: And that bothers me a lot, but here's the deal.

263
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:41,840
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm usually the kind of person who says graphics don't matter, that gameplay is more important as long as the graphics uphold the game.

264
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,940
Speaker 1: But I tend to disagree a little bit in that very good atmosphere and very good graphic and immersion design can cover for a lot of gameplay design.

265
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's mostly the design, not the image quality.

266
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:53,754
Speaker 0: There's the two very different things.

267
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,382
Speaker 1: But there's a line.

268
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:03,580
Speaker 1: Eternal Darkness was an okay game that was made much, much better just because of the style and everything.

269
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,220
Speaker 1: But if the graphics had been too much worse than it was, they couldn't have pulled off the style in the first place.

270
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,500
Speaker 0: It would have looked like those old walk around with tank controls games and polygons.

271
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:14,923
Speaker 0: You know what?

272
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:16,859
Speaker 0: When you played those games way back in the day...

273
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,040
Speaker 1: They weren't immersive at all.

274
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:18,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were.

275
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,579
Speaker 1: I guess if you were stupid.

276
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,061
Speaker 0: No.

277
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:22,361
Speaker 0: Like Half-Life 1, just as immersive as Half-Life 2.

278
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:26,559
Speaker 1: Half-Life 1, I don't think you understand the level of bad graphics I'm talking about.

279
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,800
Speaker 1: I'm talking about third person view of an 8 polygon man in a 16 polygon world.

280
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,280
Speaker 0: Okay, that's a little different.

281
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,380
Speaker 1: Anyway, so a bunch of fans decided to put together screenshots of what the game should look like.

282
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:41,811
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

283
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,030
Speaker 1: And on the left, one, this is shit grammar.

284
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:49,419
Speaker 1: How it looks like, how it should look like.

285
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:50,340
Speaker 0: Great.

286
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,079
Speaker 1: That is bad.

287
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:57,120
Speaker 1: But on the left, I see a game that looks incredibly polished and it looks kind of like "wow" and it looks really, really good.

288
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:05,440
Speaker 1: On the right, I see it looks like they just turned the saturation of the colors down, turned the contrast down, made it dark.

289
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,664
Speaker 0: Well, because that's the thing.

290
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:11,240
Speaker 0: They're not complaining about the image quality of the graphics.

291
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,223
Speaker 1: They were a little.

292
00:17:12,486 --> 00:17:14,380
Speaker 1: One of the complaints was there's colors.

293
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:14,881
Speaker 0: Right.

294
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:15,663
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing.

295
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:20,917
Speaker 0: is that Diablo, if you play Diablo 2, Diablo 2 is the only one I've played.

296
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:21,560
Speaker 0: I've never played one.

297
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,228
Speaker 1: By the way, it's a terrible game.

298
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:25,420
Speaker 1: It was a terrible game when it came out.

299
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,450
Speaker 0: Click, click, click, click, click.

300
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:27,420
Speaker 0: We're done with that.

301
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:28,879
Speaker 0: The first level.

302
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,129
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

303
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,500
Speaker 1: No, it was a great game.

304
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:37,420
Speaker 1: It was the perfect implementation of Ground Pound Down, I guess.

305
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:49,740
Speaker 0: So, the first level is a city, is a little village at night with the surrounding woodsy grassland, you know, towns and caves that are all dark and evil.

306
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,059
Speaker 0: And there's evil people all about.

307
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:56,816
Speaker 0: Level 2, I think, was a dark, evil-like rainforest where it rained.

308
00:17:56,897 --> 00:17:57,860
Speaker 0: I don't remember exactly.

309
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,100
Speaker 0: Then, you know, the final level was hell where it was dark and fiery.

310
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:08,260
Speaker 0: And every level was, you know, nighttime, dark, raining, hell, fire, brimstone, everything evil and dark.

311
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,927
Speaker 0: And the game had that kind of mood.

312
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:15,720
Speaker 0: And if you add colors to it, they're not complaining it looks too good.

313
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,323
Speaker 1: They're complaining.

314
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:23,460
Speaker 0: it doesn't look, it doesn't have the same dark and evil all the time feeling that the old Diablo had.

315
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,540
Speaker 1: See, at the same time, that feeling came mostly for the fact, you know, just design limitations that they had.

316
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,040
Speaker 1: Not so much as...

317
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,377
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but they, you know, that's...

318
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,258
Speaker 1: And two, I mean, a lot of the complaints, like, people were, like, the things people were complaining about basically did boil down to.

319
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:38,080
Speaker 1: it looks too good.

320
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,540
Speaker 1: A lot of people were complaining that it was anti-aliased and that it looked smooth and that the animations were, like, smooth and didn't chop.

321
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, that's, well, that is, you know, someone saying it's too good.

322
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,090
Speaker 0: But it seems like the majority of the people are saying, "Why are there bright colors?

323
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:56,020
Speaker 0: Diablo should be dark and evil and look like hell and bad things all the

324
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,120
Speaker 0: time.".

325
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,160
Speaker 1: Now, the game designer and a lot of smarter people came back and said, "One, these are mostly still screenshots.

326
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,380
Speaker 1: And if you played the game the way it looks in these fan-made screenshots, it would basically be unplayable.

327
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,220
Speaker 1: And the game, the way they designed it is that way because that way you can actually play it.

328
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,999
Speaker 1: And it's a fun game and it might be slightly

329
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:15,180
Speaker 1: more.".

330
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,332
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, how is it a fun game?

331
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:18,920
Speaker 0: It's still going to be... Well, that's what they're claiming.

332
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:20,360
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

333
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,618
Speaker 1: It's not going to be a fun game.

334
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,260
Speaker 0: A lot of people will think it's a fun game.

335
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,874
Speaker 0: They like, wow, they like Diablo.

336
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:25,600
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

337
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,412
Speaker 0: It's like they made Diablo 3.

338
00:19:28,412 --> 00:19:30,240
Speaker 0: I'm going to guarantee you this right now.

339
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:38,760
Speaker 0: It's basically going to be, right, a set of, you know, wow instances that you could play single player or multiplayer without a wow account.

340
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,200
Speaker 0: And it's going to be the most incredibly polished wow instances to ever exist.

341
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:45,198
Speaker 0: And that's all it's going to be.

342
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:52,040
Speaker 0: So if you like doing a wow raid or whatever, Diablo 3 is going to be the most polished wow raids in the universe.

343
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:53,287
Speaker 0: That's all it's going to be.

344
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:55,380
Speaker 0: It's going to be click, click, click on the bad guys and eventually you win.

345
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:02,979
Speaker 1: You know, I can't think if there's any other video game or board game or role playing game news.

346
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:09,135
Speaker 1: I mean, nothing else really happened except for the fact that PAX is coming to the East Coast in 2010.

347
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:09,497
Speaker 1: Oh my fuck.

348
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,142
Speaker 1: Oh my fuck.

349
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:18,880
Speaker 0: I mean, this is a news we kind of knew already, sort of, because they said it at MIT and they said it at some other places.

350
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,191
Speaker 0: But I got to talk about this.

351
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:20,798
Speaker 0: Oh my fuck.

352
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,523
Speaker 0: They're dropping.

353
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:23,936
Speaker 0: But now they're like, OK, official announcement.

354
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:24,800
Speaker 0: Fine.

355
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,486
Speaker 1: Yeah.

356
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:27,993
Speaker 1: They haven't said where yet.

357
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,159
Speaker 1: However, I have an educated one.

358
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,120
Speaker 1: It's been they're having it run by Reed Exhibitions, the people who did, you know, the New York Comic Con, the New York Anime Festival.

359
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,553
Speaker 0: And oh, comics, anime, gaming.

360
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:38,539
Speaker 0: They got a trifecta.

361
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:46,640
Speaker 1: The reason behind that is pretty much they don't have the time, the resources, the energy or any of that to deal with doing another PAX on the East Coast.

362
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,320
Speaker 0: Kevin, could you run two cons of that size a year on your own news?

363
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,620
Speaker 0: People have a hard enough time running Otacon once a year.

364
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,880
Speaker 0: Maybe a little hard enough time running KatsuCon once a year.

365
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,323
Speaker 0: You know what?

366
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,319
Speaker 1: If I didn't have a day job, I think I could.

367
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:07,360
Speaker 0: If I didn't have a day job, which is exactly why Reed Exhibitions is a good help, because their day job is run the conventions.

368
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:15,659
Speaker 0: Gabe and Tyco still have to make a comic every day, make merch, do the child's play, do the PAX one, do everything else they do.

369
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:19,340
Speaker 0: So they don't really have time to do two conventions.

370
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:26,078
Speaker 1: Because we found out about this for real at Kineticon, so of course at every panel we did, we're like, "By the way, PAX East

371
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:26,399
Speaker 1: Coast.".

372
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:28,720
Speaker 0: Thanks to my iPhone, I found out about it.

373
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,878
Speaker 1: And everyone kept asking us, "So where's it going to

374
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:30,959
Speaker 1: be?".

375
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:45,500
Speaker 1: So in case anyone hasn't figured this out or is smart enough to look around and do some research, or if you're just not familiar with the East Coast, there are really only three, at most four places it could conceivably be.

376
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,993
Speaker 0: Well that's assuming Northeast.

377
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:47,719
Speaker 0: If you went...

378
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,481
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

379
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:49,884
Speaker 1: I'm assuming all.

380
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:57,140
Speaker 1: Because Northeast, or at least Middle North, like the middle of the East Coast, are the only viable places.

381
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,340
Speaker 1: If it's further south, most people aren't going to bother.

382
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you can go to North Carolina area.

383
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:05,260
Speaker 0: That's about as south as you can go.

384
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:14,500
Speaker 0: If you go more south than that, you pretty much have to go down to Atlanta or Orlando to get a convention center.

385
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:19,160
Speaker 1: Because most of these people coming to those counties, even in the south, are coming from the north anyway.

386
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,581
Speaker 1: But here's the deal.

387
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:26,973
Speaker 1: In my professional opinion, it can only be in either D.C.

388
00:22:27,074 --> 00:22:29,999
Speaker 1: and their convention center, Baltimore at the BCC...

389
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,579
Speaker 0: Which is the place where Otakont is.

390
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,460
Speaker 1: It could conceivably be in Hartford, Connecticut, which wouldn't be the worst place.

391
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,360
Speaker 0: That's not big enough.

392
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:38,058
Speaker 1: No, it isn't.

393
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,838
Speaker 0: Not even close.

394
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,520
Speaker 1: That's why that's like the fourth string.

395
00:22:41,322 --> 00:22:43,540
Speaker 0: It could be in Boston before it was in Hartford.

396
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,840
Speaker 1: No, they'd probably go for Hartford before Boston.

397
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,637
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

398
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:50,136
Speaker 1: I'm talking about based on how far people are willing to travel.

399
00:22:50,156 --> 00:22:50,619
Speaker 1: Because remember...

400
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm talking about the space.

401
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,207
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about all the factors.

402
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:55,291
Speaker 1: Because there are other factors.

403
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:57,880
Speaker 1: I mean, how many people do they actually expect to attend?

404
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:00,237
Speaker 0: I think there's going to be 30,000 plus people.

405
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,625
Speaker 1: Scott, you're not letting me finish.

406
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:02,288
Speaker 1: I do too.

407
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,400
Speaker 1: I don't think they're going to expect that many people.

408
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:06,039
Speaker 0: I think they know how many people are going to come.

409
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:13,720
Speaker 1: No, I do not think that they expect that the East Coast Packs would, in its inaugural year, have more people than the West Coast Packs.

410
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,060
Speaker 0: I think that they must expect that the East Coast Packs will have more than the West Coast Packs.

411
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,045
Speaker 1: Now, why would they?

412
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,900
Speaker 1: I don't think that they know anything about East Coast inventions.

413
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,359
Speaker 0: Because they have Reed Exhibitions doing, helping them out.

414
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,537
Speaker 1: But they just announced... They probably said, "Reed, do our

415
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:30,060
Speaker 1: convention.".

416
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:30,543
Speaker 1: Reed said,

417
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:30,946
Speaker 1: "Okay.".

418
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:32,436
Speaker 1: And Reed's doing the... They don't care.

419
00:23:32,497 --> 00:23:32,859
Speaker 1: They don't know.

420
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,540
Speaker 0: No, they seem to say that they had a lot of say in what's going on and Reed is just doing the logistics for them.

421
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,529
Speaker 1: Yes, but at the same time, they wouldn't know.

422
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,440
Speaker 1: And Reed doesn't even really know.

423
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,140
Speaker 1: Because Reed, they're probably going to want it to be in the Javits, which is probably the worst possible place it could be.

424
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,267
Speaker 0: That's a really bad idea to put in the Javits.

425
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:54,460
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess it has enough floor space for the exhibition hall.

426
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,187
Speaker 1: No, there's no hotels for people to stay in.

427
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:57,854
Speaker 1: There's no easy way to get to the Javits.

428
00:23:58,135 --> 00:23:59,380
Speaker 1: It would be a shitty con.

429
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:00,979
Speaker 0: It would be a very shitty con.

430
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:05,192
Speaker 1: But the thing is, that's probably one of the few places it could be.

431
00:24:05,554 --> 00:24:07,379
Speaker 1: And there's a decent chance that's where it might end up.

432
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,140
Speaker 0: Just because Reed Exhibitions is in love with that building.

433
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,989
Speaker 1: But seriously, it can only really be in

434
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:13,551
Speaker 1: D.C.,

435
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:16,000
Speaker 1: Baltimore, or New York City.

436
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:20,340
Speaker 1: And honestly, if I were them, I would put it in the Baltimore Convention Center.

437
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,263
Speaker 0: I also would.

438
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:25,617
Speaker 0: Because Otacon takes up that whole building and they have almost 30,000 people.

439
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:32,937
Speaker 1: Plus, by 2010, the giant expansion to the BCC will be done, which is going to allow Otacon to expand to 30,000+ easily.

440
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think PAX could definitely use that entire building.

441
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:42,700
Speaker 0: If you look, instead of the dealer's room, they would have the exhibition room that could fit in there.

442
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:44,900
Speaker 0: Plus, plenty of room for everything else.

443
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,227
Speaker 1: Forget all the logistics and everything.

444
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,193
Speaker 1: The D.C.

445
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:48,440
Speaker 1: Convention Center is big enough.

446
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,860
Speaker 1: But it's also, for the kinds of cons that these are, a really bad layout.

447
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:56,674
Speaker 1: The Javits is almost as bad, but the D.C.

448
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:57,720
Speaker 1: Convention Center just wouldn't cut it.

449
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,540
Speaker 0: Because the Javits is really only designed for the one big room kind of con.

450
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,680
Speaker 0: If you have the auto show, it's a big room with big displays.

451
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,923
Speaker 1: Well, there's more to it than that.

452
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:12,220
Speaker 1: I mean, anime and gaming cons have a lot of hotel to convention back and forth traffic.

453
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,712
Speaker 1: They have a lot more internal foot traffic.

454
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,180
Speaker 1: They have a lot of bursts of traffic.

455
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,739
Speaker 1: They have a lot of people hanging out in hallways.

456
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,140
Speaker 1: It's a totally different thing from every other kind of convention in the world.

457
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,040
Speaker 1: And the BCC is one of the few convention centers that really, really deals with it well.

458
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:33,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, just because it has so many, you know, it's wide, it's got hallways, it's got lots of separate rooms.

459
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,180
Speaker 1: It's got multiple paths to get to most places.

460
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's got, you know, hotels are across the street directly.

461
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,900
Speaker 1: Also, the BCC's escalators hold out better than any con center I've ever seen.

462
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:47,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can walk to a place to eat.

463
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:49,279
Speaker 1: Well, that's starting to change.

464
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:53,190
Speaker 0: It is, but actually I was reading that some new places opened up.

465
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,780
Speaker 0: There's apparently a Chipotle next to the Hard Rock.

466
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:58,700
Speaker 1: Ah, but there's no Fuddruckers anymore.

467
00:25:58,942 --> 00:25:59,200
Speaker 1: Nope.

468
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,880
Speaker 1: May it rest, may it burn in hell.

469
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,698
Speaker 0: I'm going to eat at that Chipotle at least once.

470
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:06,095
Speaker 1: But yeah, PEX, 2010, East Coast.

471
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:12,280
Speaker 1: We work with Reed Exhibitions a bit because, you know, New York Comic Con, New York Anime Festival.

472
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:14,680
Speaker 1: So, we'll see if we can get some sort of scoop.

473
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:16,980
Speaker 0: Oh, we're going to be scooping it up, there's no doubt.

474
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:24,420
Speaker 1: I'm also going to try to talk to everyone involved and at least make my opinion known because, seriously, I think Baltimore is the best choice.

475
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,560
Speaker 1: And I think that the Javits would really fundamentally hurt PAX East Coast.

476
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,239
Speaker 0: I think if they had it in the Javits, it would bomb and then they might not do it again.

477
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,924
Speaker 1: But here's my prediction.

478
00:26:34,165 --> 00:26:38,740
Speaker 1: If it were in the Baltimore Convention Center in, say, May, that's probably the best time.

479
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely you want to do it April/May because that way it won't conflict with pretty much anything.

480
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:46,810
Speaker 0: Don't put it in August with the other cons.

481
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,600
Speaker 0: That's just making a mess of everything conflicting.

482
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,980
Speaker 0: Go May when there's no other conventions going down.

483
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,680
Speaker 0: Sure, the kids are still in school a little bit, but it's on the East Coast so they don't have to go very far.

484
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,771
Speaker 1: I would wager it would get 28,000 people.

485
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:03,220
Speaker 1: That is like the number I would put out as my number.

486
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,381
Speaker 0: I'd say it could be as high as 35.

487
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:06,407
Speaker 1: It could be, but I'm guessing 28,000.

488
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:07,111
Speaker 1: That is my absolute guess.

489
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:10,440
Speaker 1: It could be higher.

490
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,200
Speaker 0: I'm guessing actually 30+ definitely.

491
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:13,938
Speaker 1: I don't know.

492
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:21,500
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand how many people on the East Coast are like, they hunger for the petty arcade action and they haven't gotten any.

493
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,519
Speaker 1: I know, I know, but I also know there are people who will wait a year.

494
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:26,755
Speaker 0: Maybe.

495
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:33,080
Speaker 1: Plus remember, the East Coast was burned by the first New York Comic Con in a big way.

496
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,045
Speaker 0: But that was a Comic Con.

497
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:36,620
Speaker 0: This is gaming, video gaming on the East Coast.

498
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:46,120
Speaker 0: There hasn't been a gaming convention over here ever and there are lots and lots of video gamers and they hunger, seriously.

499
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,506
Speaker 0: So this is like a brand new thing.

500
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:48,592
Speaker 0: They're going to be like, "Holy

501
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:48,874
Speaker 0: shit!"

502
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:50,060
Speaker 0: and poop their pants and go.

503
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,759
Speaker 1: Run, coward, run, run, run.

504
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:59,500
Speaker 1: The other thing is that there is someone out here that they could tap in a big way if they're down in DC or Baltimore.

505
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,024
Speaker 1: Me?

506
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:01,738
Speaker 1: Other than us.

507
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,459
Speaker 1: It's the dude who supplies the classic arcade cabinets.

508
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,200
Speaker 1: To Katsucon.

509
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,860
Speaker 1: Every year, we hang out in the video game room in Katsucon, we're staffed there, we do shows, it's a big deal.

510
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,760
Speaker 1: They have an arcade and the arcade has like, root beer tapper and zookeeper.

511
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:24,677
Speaker 0: That video-topia guy, Pax, could actually afford to probably get him to bring every game he has to Pax.

512
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,140
Speaker 0: The thing is, he would need to hire guys to temporarily repair all the machines.

513
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,680
Speaker 1: Pax could cover that.

514
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:31,177
Speaker 0: They could.

515
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:32,560
Speaker 1: That guy's not that expensive.

516
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,400
Speaker 0: He's not, but it would be crazy awesome.

517
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:35,420
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

518
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:37,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have to talk.

519
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,139
Speaker 0: If he could set up all his machines at once.

520
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, listen.

521
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:48,033
Speaker 1: So, all of you out there, if you happen to know Monsieurs Gabe and Tycho, not to say, "Listen to us, listen to us,".

522
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:51,620
Speaker 1: but we kind of know all the business about running an East Coast convention.

523
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,619
Speaker 1: We could probably help in a big way.

524
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:02,269
Speaker 1: Anyway, things of the day.

525
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,430
Speaker 1: Again, all you new listeners.

526
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,309
Speaker 1: Things of the day is a little bit we do.

527
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,190
Speaker 1: You know it's a late show.

528
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,269
Speaker 1: Late shows have to have bits.

529
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:13,824
Speaker 1: We basically just talk about the funniest, coolest, weirdest, or whatever thing we've seen in the last day or so.

530
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:16,350
Speaker 1: that might be at least somewhat related to the topic of the night.

531
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:17,440
Speaker 0: Yep.

532
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:17,860
Speaker 0: Yep.

533
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,470
Speaker 0: So, should I go first?

534
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:20,389
Speaker 1: I think you should.

535
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:30,370
Speaker 0: This isn't really gaming related, but that doesn't ... Well, unless you're talking about the game of life or the game of don't go to jail or I guess get out of jail free.

536
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,930
Speaker 1: I'm real good at that first game.

537
00:29:33,753 --> 00:29:35,169
Speaker 0: So, this is a video of this.

538
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,570
Speaker 0: Pretty much he's like a defense lawyer, professor.

539
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,630
Speaker 0: I'm not really sure, but he's definitely a defense lawyer type person.

540
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,650
Speaker 0: And he basically gives this ... He talks really fast and I really ... I don't think I like his personality.

541
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,530
Speaker 0: At least the personality, the idea I get of his personality.

542
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:50,659
Speaker 0: Why?

543
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,610
Speaker 1: Do you get the impression that he's a little sleazy?

544
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,290
Speaker 0: I get the impression that he's sort of a fast talking sort of kind of guy.

545
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,908
Speaker 1: He's a lawyer.

546
00:29:58,552 --> 00:29:58,829
Speaker 1: Yeah.

547
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,829
Speaker 1: No offense to all our lawyer friends.

548
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:01,346
Speaker 0: No.

549
00:30:02,132 --> 00:30:05,750
Speaker 0: He definitely seems like he has ... I agree with everything he's saying.

550
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,630
Speaker 0: It's just his personality is a little bit grating.

551
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:18,029
Speaker 0: But anyway, the points he's making are great, which is he pretty much says, "Don't talk to the police under any circumstances, whether you're innocent, whether you're guilty, no matter what

552
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:18,690
Speaker 0: happens.".

553
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,669
Speaker 1: Well, there's one exception though that I do want to bring up, just in case.

554
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,630
Speaker 1: If you're witnessing a crime, you probably want to tell the police what you saw, as long as you're not a suspect.

555
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:31,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he's pretty much saying, "Use the Fifth Amendment whenever

556
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:31,800
Speaker 0: possible.".

557
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:39,050
Speaker 0: If you have Fifth Amendment rights, exercise them to the fullest extent, no matter the circumstances.

558
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,370
Speaker 0: Don't say anything unless you have to say something.

559
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,910
Speaker 0: Get a lawyer before you open your mouth about anything, and then talk only to the lawyer.

560
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,930
Speaker 0: And then he goes through a whole bunch of points of exactly why.

561
00:30:50,070 --> 00:31:00,490
Speaker 0: The most interesting point he brought up, actually, that really freaked me out, was we know that a lot of the people on death row, right, were pretty much they didn't do it.

562
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,030
Speaker 0: And then they were later proven to be not guilty by DNA evidence, right?

563
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:21,810
Speaker 0: 25% of those people who were found out later, not just death row, but 25% of the people who were exonerated after the fact because of DNA evidence, were people who confessed because they talked.

564
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,750
Speaker 0: They basically didn't use the Fifth Amendment.

565
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:30,430
Speaker 0: If they had used the Fifth Amendment, they wouldn't have been in jail, and they wouldn't have had to be exonerated by DNA evidence later.

566
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:35,510
Speaker 0: And they could have avoided jail, and their lives could have been great, but they didn't use the Fifth Amendment, so they got fucked.

567
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:47,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically it's just that you kind of have to protect your own rights, and because you can't be sure of a police officer in a situation, and because of the way the system is, you really, you've got to hold on to your right.

568
00:31:47,770 --> 00:32:00,110
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, the case in point, the good example of if a police officer wants to search your car, and you say no, you don't consent, and he doesn't have probable cause, but he decides to search it anyway, or demands that you open the trunk, or he's going to shoot it open, or whatever.

569
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:05,728
Speaker 1: You've got to just keep saying, "I'm not going to resist because blah, blah, blah, but I still do not consent to this

570
00:32:05,748 --> 00:32:06,089
Speaker 1: search.".

571
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:06,610
Speaker 0: Yep.

572
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:20,470
Speaker 0: But anyway, the best part of the video, right, is actually, you know, he talks really, I think maybe he's talking really fast, not just because he's a fast talker, but because he doesn't have a lot of time, and he's trying to give this other guy enough time to talk.

573
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:32,789
Speaker 0: And the other guy is actually a policeman, basically, but he's also, he said they don't like the word interrogation, they use the word interview, but he's interrogated.

574
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:43,430
Speaker 0: He says thousands of people, at least hundreds, lots of people, right, or interviewed hundreds or thousands of people over his years, you know, 20 plus years as a police officer.

575
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:50,825
Speaker 0: And he pretty much comes up, and you expect him to be like, you know, disagreeing with the guy who just talked, saying, "Don't talk to the police.

576
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,809
Speaker 0: Well, here's the police to argue with

577
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:52,929
Speaker 0: me.".

578
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:58,680
Speaker 0: And the guy, the cop comes up, and he says, "Everything that the defense lawyer said is absolutely correct.

579
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,063
Speaker 0: Don't say a thing.

580
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:03,309
Speaker 0: Here is how we turn what you say against

581
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:03,470
Speaker 0: you.".

582
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,139
Speaker 0: Because remember, anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.

583
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,466
Speaker 0: There is no way anything you say can help you.

584
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:14,948
Speaker 0: It can only hurt you.

585
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:16,090
Speaker 0: So don't say anything.

586
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,251
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing.

587
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:18,633
Speaker 1: You want a good example?

588
00:33:18,673 --> 00:33:20,076
Speaker 1: Remember that movie, My Cousin Vinny?

589
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:21,278
Speaker 1: Good movie?

590
00:33:21,718 --> 00:33:22,159
Speaker 1: Remember how?

591
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:29,110
Speaker 1: one of the reasons they convict him is they sit him down, the police officers, and he doesn't know that they're trying to get him for murder.

592
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,874
Speaker 1: He thinks that they sped or something.

593
00:33:30,914 --> 00:33:33,399
Speaker 1: He has no idea why he's in the police office.

594
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,405
Speaker 1: And then the cop's like, "You killed the

595
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:36,765
Speaker 1: clerk.".

596
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:38,349
Speaker 1: And he's like, "I killed the

597
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:38,769
Speaker 1: clerk?".

598
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:42,378
Speaker 1: And then in the courtroom, they read his confession.

599
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:44,243
Speaker 1: It's like, "I said again, you killed the

600
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:44,584
Speaker 1: clerk."

601
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:46,548
Speaker 1: To which he responded, "I killed the

602
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:46,849
Speaker 1: clerk.".

603
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,771
Speaker 0: Yep.

604
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:49,394
Speaker 0: Exactly.

605
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:58,209
Speaker 0: So you should watch these two videos, and I don't know if anyone who's smart enough to be a Geek Nights listener will have too many run-ins with the police, other than maybe some traffic tickets.

606
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,893
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, traffic tickets.

607
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:07,209
Speaker 1: We should do a show on how to get out of a traffic ticket, because I've gotten out of about 60% of the ones I've been pulled over for.

608
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:13,004
Speaker 0: The first thing this cop says when he gets up, he says, "People ask me, 'How do I get out of a speeding

609
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:13,304
Speaker 0: ticket?'".

610
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:14,286
Speaker 0: He says, "Don't

611
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:14,708
Speaker 0: speed.".

612
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:27,690
Speaker 0: So yeah, watch these two videos, and in your life, if it ever becomes necessary, hopefully it won't, but if it does, keep your mouth shut and get a lawyer.

613
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:28,436
Speaker 1: Here's the difference.

614
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,507
Speaker 1: Unless you did it.

615
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:30,931
Speaker 0: Well, no.

616
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:33,757
Speaker 0: He says, "Whether you did it or didn't do it, keep your mouth

617
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:33,938
Speaker 0: shut.".

618
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:37,045
Speaker 0: Because look, if you talk to the police, right?

619
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,750
Speaker 0: This is why this video is so great.

620
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,014
Speaker 0: He says, "Look, let's say you did it, right?

621
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:47,148
Speaker 0: Of course you want to plead guilty to get a lesser sentence, because you're not going to get out of it without Johnnie Cochran, right?

622
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:47,829
Speaker 0: If there's a mountain of

623
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:48,210
Speaker 0: evidence.".

624
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,030
Speaker 1: But they won't give you the real plea bargain unless you actually talk to a lawyer who does all the business.

625
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,051
Speaker 0: Right, right.

626
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:57,679
Speaker 0: If you just talk before your lawyer gets there, they're just going to run you through.

627
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:04,090
Speaker 0: If you just keep your mouth shut until your lawyer gets there, then you're going to get to bargain and get your better deal.

628
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,736
Speaker 1: That is game theory for the South.

629
00:35:07,378 --> 00:35:12,290
Speaker 1: But for society, if you did it, confess, asshole.

630
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:13,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, just not right away.

631
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,210
Speaker 0: Wait until the lawyer gets there.

632
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,590
Speaker 1: Do I know how to avoid having run-ins with the police?

633
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,030
Speaker 0: Don't commit any crimes?

634
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,310
Speaker 0: Of course, the thing is...

635
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,466
Speaker 1: Or don't film police officers doing their duty.

636
00:35:22,506 --> 00:35:22,970
Speaker 1: They hate that.

637
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:36,730
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, right, Rim, you know how we always talk about how basically there are so many laws that pretty much everything is illegal, and if a cop looks at you long enough or drives behind you long enough, they can always find a reason to pull you over no matter what.

638
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:42,965
Speaker 1: I mean, if I, I don't know, murdered a bunch of... Well, I guess if I murdered a bunch of people, I'm crazy, so I'm not going to confess anyway.

639
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:44,730
Speaker 1: I don't really have a good example.

640
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:50,286
Speaker 0: These guys actually talk about how there are so many laws that we can't count them.

641
00:35:50,306 --> 00:35:51,710
Speaker 0: We don't know how many laws there are.

642
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:58,150
Speaker 0: And if you talk, they will go over everything you said, and they will find something illegal every time.

643
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:04,510
Speaker 0: Like, he was talking about people who they got because they had, where they were in possession of lobsters.

644
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:12,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, because pretty much everything is, they can always find something illegal no matter what.

645
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:21,090
Speaker 0: So don't say anything, and you won't incriminate yourself for anything because they don't decide, you know, it's not like you go in and they're like, "We're only looking for robbery if you say you did

646
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,290
Speaker 0: something.".

647
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,599
Speaker 0: No, they're looking for anything.

648
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,969
Speaker 0: If you broke any law, they got you.

649
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:27,789
Speaker 1: So, I have a vidya game-related thing of the day.

650
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,350
Speaker 1: Tribes 2 is like the best...

651
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,089
Speaker 0: Is it the bees?

652
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:32,649
Speaker 1: No, not the bees.

653
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:33,729
Speaker 0: It's not the bees.

654
00:36:33,832 --> 00:36:34,289
Speaker 1: Not the bees.

655
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,250
Speaker 0: So it's not the bees.

656
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,013
Speaker 1: It's not the bees.

657
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:36,958
Speaker 1: Oh my god, what is it?

658
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,165
Speaker 1: Oh my god, what is it?

659
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:38,648
Speaker 1: What is that?

660
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:39,030
Speaker 1: What is it?

661
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:39,848
Speaker 0: It's not the bees.

662
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:40,650
Speaker 1: Okay.

663
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:48,110
Speaker 1: So Tribes 2 is pretty much the best for Team... Stateless... never mind, I'm not going to go into that again.

664
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,344
Speaker 1: Tribes 2 is like the best Team FPS ever made.

665
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:51,950
Speaker 0: It is the best to ever exist.

666
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,890
Speaker 1: It is the best team-based multiplayer stateless capture the flag FPS.

667
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:03,129
Speaker 0: Well, it is all those things, but what non-stateless, non-team-based multiplayer FPS is better?

668
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:03,330
Speaker 0: Nothing.

669
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,669
Speaker 1: Well, I also said capture the flag.

670
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:08,230
Speaker 0: What capture the flag is... What capture the flag FPS is better than...

671
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm saying not because it's a non-capture the flag game.

672
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:11,330
Speaker 1: I don't want to...

673
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:12,350
Speaker 0: It is all those things, but...

674
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,456
Speaker 1: I don't want to compare apples to oranges.

675
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:18,228
Speaker 1: That's like saying, "The Godfather is the best movie or video game ever

676
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:18,549
Speaker 1: made.".

677
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:20,690
Speaker 0: Well, there is a Godfather video game, I'm saying.

678
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,229
Speaker 1: Not the best video game ever made.

679
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:27,860
Speaker 0: No, but Tribes 2 is the best multiplayer FPS compared to all other varieties of multiplayer FPS.

680
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,055
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

681
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:30,427
Speaker 1: NS is up there, but anyway...

682
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,689
Speaker 0: NS is the second best multiplayer FPS.

683
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,988
Speaker 1: Anyway, Tribes 2 was great, and this video basically shows... You know, the game had vehicles and everything.

684
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:38,450
Speaker 1: I'm not going to talk.

685
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,132
Speaker 1: Just watch it.

686
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:45,230
Speaker 1: if you thought Tribes 2 was awesome, and this shows you a dude who is one of the better Shrike pilots I've ever seen.

687
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,290
Speaker 1: Now, the thing to remember, if you're not too familiar with Tribes 2...

688
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,764
Speaker 0: Go try to pilot the Shrike.

689
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:50,370
Speaker 0: It sucks.

690
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:52,090
Speaker 0: The thing just crashes all over the place.

691
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,654
Speaker 1: Yeah, Tribes 2 could have been made better.

692
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:58,590
Speaker 1: Halo and a lot of games have learned how to do vehicles a lot better, but Tribes 2 did it first.

693
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,723
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't the first game to ever have vehicles.

694
00:38:01,743 --> 00:38:03,270
Speaker 0: I mean, Half-Life 1 had vehicles.

695
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,477
Speaker 1: Those were not vehicles.

696
00:38:04,517 --> 00:38:06,550
Speaker 1: Those were basically suicide machines.

697
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,470
Speaker 0: They were vehicles.

698
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:16,310
Speaker 1: However, I contend that the vehicles in Counter-Strike in particular were more fun than the vehicles in any FPS today.

699
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,141
Speaker 0: Jeep-a-thon 2K!

700
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,130
Speaker 1: That was like the best map ever.

701
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:20,587
Speaker 0: She gets some of that going on, but anyway...

702
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,790
Speaker 1: Nothing was more fun than being in a Jeep with six other guys, Paris...

703
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,508
Speaker 0: Three other guys.

704
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:36,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, saw a number of guys driving past another Jeep with an equal number of guys all with Paris, shooting at each other, having a ride as time, and then suddenly one of the Jeeps flips over and kills everyone in it randomly.

705
00:38:37,011 --> 00:38:49,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, the point is that Tribes 2, as great as it was, it's an old game from 2000-2001, and the vehicles were busted because that was the best they could do in those days, and they were very hard to pilot.

706
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:54,550
Speaker 0: And here's a video of a guy piloting them like his car.

707
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:05,610
Speaker 1: Now, the other cool thing is that if you're not familiar with Tribes, keep in mind that while these guys are piloting these vehicles all up, they're just dudes around the map fighting on foot at the same time.

708
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:06,147
Speaker 0: Yep.

709
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:08,450
Speaker 1: Anyway, I thought that was pretty cool.

710
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:14,110
Speaker 1: So, we're going to go kind of short because it's late, it's Tuesday, tomorrow night we got a pack for Otacon.

711
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,969
Speaker 0: Yep, so check this out.

712
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:20,850
Speaker 0: I've been looking in the, you know, the DS Homebrew scene for a while, right?

713
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:33,028
Speaker 0: There's all this huge hullabaloo, especially on the other side of the Pacific Ocean about the R4 and these things, but basically... Yeah.

714
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:36,030
Speaker 1: You said hullabaloo, I don't know what the hell you were thinking.

715
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:36,828
Speaker 0: That's fine.

716
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,850
Speaker 0: So, but basically the deal is, is that people know how the DS works.

717
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,610
Speaker 0: The DS is not a complicated piece of hardware, right?

718
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:45,586
Speaker 0: The Nintendo DS.

719
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:49,150
Speaker 0: And it didn't take hackers a very long time.

720
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,849
Speaker 0: I mean, this technology has been around for years.

721
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:59,910
Speaker 0: Basically what they do is they have this card that goes in, it looks like a DS cartridge, but you put a normal microSD memory card in it.

722
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:04,130
Speaker 0: And you put that in your DS and it boots on your DS.

723
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:10,830
Speaker 0: And then your DS can, you can run any software you want in your DS, not just games you buy at the store.

724
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:16,489
Speaker 0: So this includes, you know, technically people write their own software and run it on the DS.

725
00:40:17,353 --> 00:40:18,750
Speaker 0: You can make your own DS games.

726
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,409
Speaker 0: People were doing this in GBA days too.

727
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,650
Speaker 0: They're making their own GBA games and putting them on, you know, flashcards.

728
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:30,510
Speaker 0: They, you can go and download, you know, NES and SNES ROMs and ROMs for other systems too.

729
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:36,330
Speaker 0: Like I guess, you know, Sega Genesis and Master System and I guess maybe Commodore 64, who knows?

730
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:39,189
Speaker 0: And you have emulators that they wrote for the DS.

731
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:44,710
Speaker 0: And then you run these ROMs in the emulator on the DS and it lets you take your NES and SNES games portable.

732
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:53,410
Speaker 0: And also what you can do is you can just put Nintendo DS or Game Boy ROMs on this, on the memory card.

733
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:56,389
Speaker 0: And then just play them on your DS without actually buying them.

734
00:40:57,671 --> 00:41:03,130
Speaker 0: And so I've been curious about these things for a while, but the thing was, is that there were always trouble.

735
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:05,630
Speaker 0: You had to buy like a bunch of separate pieces.

736
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:08,910
Speaker 0: You had to flash your firmware on your DS.

737
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,850
Speaker 0: It was a whole bunch of trouble.

738
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,147
Speaker 0: I didn't want to brick my DS.

739
00:41:12,572 --> 00:41:14,110
Speaker 0: You know, it was a little risky.

740
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:19,529
Speaker 0: I was waiting for sort of the perfect solution, you know, something that didn't stick out the top of the DS.

741
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,928
Speaker 0: Something that didn't cost a fortune.

742
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,570
Speaker 1: Something that didn't completely eat the battery in like 10 minutes.

743
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:24,849
Speaker 0: Well, I'll get to that.

744
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,371
Speaker 1: Yeah.

745
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:32,110
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the answer to the begged question is that now you didn't find a perfect one, not even close.

746
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,090
Speaker 0: Well, it's all going to tell you.

747
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,030
Speaker 0: So at Kineticon, I finally broke down and I bought the M3DS Reel.

748
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,730
Speaker 0: I bought sort of like the ultimate one.

749
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,370
Speaker 0: It came with a little micro SD USB reader.

750
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:45,234
Speaker 0: It came with a rumble pack.

751
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:51,830
Speaker 0: It came with a GBA expansion slot and it came with the M3DS, the actual card itself.

752
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:52,172
Speaker 0: Right.

753
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,610
Speaker 0: And the guy was talking it up.

754
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,970
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, it's all just drag and drop all the stuff onto the memory card.

755
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,269
Speaker 0: And it works is mostly true.

756
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:03,367
Speaker 0: So I get home.

757
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:03,610
Speaker 0: Right.

758
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,510
Speaker 0: Here's what you got to know about these M3DS Reels or I guess the R4 or any of the other things.

759
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:08,915
Speaker 0: Right.

760
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:09,727
Speaker 0: You get it.

761
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:12,090
Speaker 0: You got to have an SD memory card.

762
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:12,451
Speaker 0: Right.

763
00:42:12,492 --> 00:42:13,790
Speaker 0: I suggest getting a big one.

764
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,266
Speaker 0: I ordered a four gig micro SD because DS games are like 256 megs.

765
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,650
Speaker 0: So if you want to have more than one on there, you're going to need a lot of space.

766
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,870
Speaker 1: Luckily, that sort of memory is getting cheaper and cheaper.

767
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,281
Speaker 1: So these.

768
00:42:25,302 --> 00:42:25,405
Speaker 1: Yeah.

769
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:33,850
Speaker 0: I ordered a four gig micro SDHC from Newegg for, I think, like fourteen dollars, maybe seventeen dollars.

770
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:35,310
Speaker 0: So it's basically nothing.

771
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:36,414
Speaker 0: All right.

772
00:42:36,474 --> 00:42:38,930
Speaker 0: So you get you put the memory card in there.

773
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:39,391
Speaker 0: Right.

774
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:45,470
Speaker 0: And you put it in the DS and it says, you know, well, first, if you don't put a memory card in, it says no memory card.

775
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:46,213
Speaker 0: All right.

776
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:49,970
Speaker 0: So you put the memory card and it says no system files found.

777
00:42:50,532 --> 00:42:54,370
Speaker 0: You have to go online and get the system files and put them on the memory card.

778
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:55,153
Speaker 1: Why?

779
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,570
Speaker 0: That's how it works still.

780
00:42:58,631 --> 00:42:58,832
Speaker 0: All right.

781
00:42:58,852 --> 00:43:02,870
Speaker 0: So you get these system files and you drag this folder onto your SD memory card.

782
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:07,450
Speaker 0: Now the system starts up and the system has a bunch of built in software.

783
00:43:07,991 --> 00:43:16,230
Speaker 0: It has a built in NES emulator, SNES emulator and has media playing stuff or playing music and movies that are converted to the right format.

784
00:43:17,033 --> 00:43:19,650
Speaker 0: It can play and and Nintendo DS and GBA games.

785
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:20,573
Speaker 0: Right.

786
00:43:20,594 --> 00:43:21,782
Speaker 0: But it plays those natively.

787
00:43:21,822 --> 00:43:22,930
Speaker 0: It doesn't emulate them or anything.

788
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:30,670
Speaker 0: It just sort of loads them into the memory of your DS and runs them as if you actually had the cartridge and PDA stuff in there, whatever.

789
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:33,049
Speaker 0: And I tried out all these things.

790
00:43:33,431 --> 00:43:39,470
Speaker 0: You know, I even installed like alternative SNES emulators because really I wanted to sort of get some SNES on the go.

791
00:43:40,511 --> 00:43:44,150
Speaker 0: And while they work, they don't work well.

792
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:50,910
Speaker 0: It really reminds me of sort of the DOS days, not super DOS days because there's a GUI going on and it's a little bit easier than that.

793
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:54,287
Speaker 0: But everything is sort of hackish or not very polished.

794
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,630
Speaker 1: The original GUI interface to Nesticle.

795
00:43:58,191 --> 00:43:59,236
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know it's it's it is.

796
00:43:59,296 --> 00:44:02,750
Speaker 0: it's a lot like the old Nesticle, like the emulators don't work perfectly.

797
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:10,130
Speaker 0: Like in Super Metroid, I had to keep adjusting like the layers of sprites and backgrounds and which ones were on top of which other ones.

798
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:15,110
Speaker 0: Because like Sam, everything would look fine, but then I'd go in a door and Sam was to be on top of the door.

799
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,922
Speaker 0: I'd be like, no, Sam is supposed to be in the door.

800
00:44:17,144 --> 00:44:17,949
Speaker 0: So something's wrong.

801
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:20,161
Speaker 1: So that's even worse than the DOS days.

802
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:21,810
Speaker 1: I didn't really have problems like that often.

803
00:44:21,991 --> 00:44:22,273
Speaker 0: I know.

804
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:24,710
Speaker 1: So except for like like a really crazy Rob.

805
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:25,332
Speaker 1: You know what?

806
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:26,841
Speaker 1: StarTropics.

807
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:28,490
Speaker 1: There's no way that's working now.

808
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:35,190
Speaker 0: But basically, the limitations of the DS hardware make a lot of these homebrew apps less than polished.

809
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,114
Speaker 0: They're not perfect.

810
00:44:36,194 --> 00:44:39,090
Speaker 0: You know, like the PDA stuff and the media playing stuff.

811
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:44,230
Speaker 0: I mean, because I have an iPod and iPhone, actually, that stuff is pretty much useless.

812
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:50,750
Speaker 0: But I could imagine if I was a high school kid and I didn't have an iPhone or an iPod or anything, that wouldn't be too bad.

813
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:51,031
Speaker 0: It would.

814
00:44:51,111 --> 00:44:57,010
Speaker 0: you know, it would be worth my trouble and time to get that working, you know, especially especially if I had a big old SD card.

815
00:44:57,851 --> 00:45:01,321
Speaker 0: But as it is, it's basically subpar.

816
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:04,410
Speaker 0: It's sort of like the Internet on the Wii with the Opera browser.

817
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:10,590
Speaker 0: It's like if you have a computer plugged into your TV, why would you ever use the Wii Opera browser?

818
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:22,270
Speaker 0: But if the Wii is the only thing plugged into your TV and you don't have a computer plugged into your TV, which I imagine is actually the case for most people, even though, you know, you're geeks, you should have a computer plugged into your TV at this point.

819
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:30,210
Speaker 0: The Wii Opera browser becomes sort of useful if you want to watch, look at a web thing, you know, or I guess you can watch YouTube on it, right?

820
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,465
Speaker 0: Does that work now or does it not?

821
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:31,890
Speaker 0: I don't know.

822
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,849
Speaker 1: I haven't even checked.

823
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:34,835
Speaker 0: I haven't used it in forever.

824
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:36,820
Speaker 0: But, you know, that sort of thing.

825
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,610
Speaker 0: It does, you know, if you want to do that, then that's a good way to go.

826
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:43,856
Speaker 0: So it has this PDA and media playing functionality.

827
00:45:44,337 --> 00:45:50,749
Speaker 0: It's really only good if that's the only poor PDA media playing functionality that you have.

828
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,290
Speaker 0: that's portable.

829
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,676
Speaker 0: If you have an iPod, it's useless.

830
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,346
Speaker 0: So the emulating is sort of hackish.

831
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:56,130
Speaker 0: I already said that.

832
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,859
Speaker 0: Another problem with it is that the battery life, it sort of sucks.

833
00:46:00,919 --> 00:46:05,390
Speaker 0: I mean, DS, if you're playing off a real DS cartridge, the battery lasts for like fucking ever.

834
00:46:05,611 --> 00:46:05,752
Speaker 1: Yeah.

835
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:07,342
Speaker 1: Like I'll go days and days and days.

836
00:46:07,402 --> 00:46:08,670
Speaker 1: Then suddenly, oh, my battery.

837
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:09,111
Speaker 0: Yeah.

838
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,180
Speaker 0: I had a fully charged DS this morning.

839
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:13,690
Speaker 0: I played a game for about half the train ride.

840
00:46:14,092 --> 00:46:16,965
Speaker 0: I played it for a little while at work because no one's at work now.

841
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:18,030
Speaker 0: They all went to North Carolina.

842
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,499
Speaker 0: They saw the other tech guys and then I played it on the way home.

843
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:25,590
Speaker 0: And while the battery didn't die, the light was red all the way home.

844
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:26,273
Speaker 0: It was not.

845
00:46:26,514 --> 00:46:27,136
Speaker 0: it was not good.

846
00:46:27,156 --> 00:46:30,310
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm used to having the light green throughout the entire day.

847
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:33,258
Speaker 0: So that that didn't please me very much.

848
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:36,650
Speaker 0: But it did play the game, you know, for as long as I wanted to play it.

849
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,155
Speaker 0: So I guess that that wasn't a problem.

850
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:41,990
Speaker 0: So really, you know, they justify this.

851
00:46:42,311 --> 00:46:48,230
Speaker 0: These, you know, DS homebrew cards saying, oh, we're making homebrew apps, which I can fully support.

852
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:53,646
Speaker 0: And they say, you know, oh, we're taking games that aren't portable, making them portable.

853
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:54,710
Speaker 0: that, you know, we own them.

854
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:55,656
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, that's not.

855
00:46:55,677 --> 00:46:57,470
Speaker 0: that's justifiable in some way.

856
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,429
Speaker 1: Back in the day, I wanted nothing more than to be able to carry an SNES game around with me.

857
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:01,971
Speaker 0: Yeah.

858
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:07,510
Speaker 0: And this is a lot better than getting one of those guys who took an SNES and put it in a different box that's smaller.

859
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,014
Speaker 0: You know, that's that's unpractical.

860
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:14,270
Speaker 0: So I can sort of support that even though the software that does it is pretty shitty.

861
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:21,450
Speaker 0: The thing is, the only thing this card does well is play DS and GBA ROMs.

862
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,654
Speaker 0: And it does it.

863
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:27,450
Speaker 0: it does it perfectly because it's just taking the software and running it natively.

864
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:31,684
Speaker 0: Like you put a GBA ROM in there and it's as if you had the cartridge.

865
00:47:31,705 --> 00:47:33,210
Speaker 0: You put a Nintendo DS ROM in there.

866
00:47:33,571 --> 00:47:35,179
Speaker 0: It's as if you had the cartridge.

867
00:47:35,279 --> 00:47:37,490
Speaker 0: It is absolutely perfect, except for the battery life.

868
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:39,038
Speaker 0: And it just works.

869
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:40,588
Speaker 0: And yeah.

870
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:48,589
Speaker 0: So on the one hand, I sort of because I've bought a lot of DS games in my day, a lot.

871
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:52,929
Speaker 0: So now that I don't have to buy any DS games because they're basically all free.

872
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,830
Speaker 1: Oh, so you're just going to start pirating everything?

873
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:55,672
Speaker 0: I don't know.

874
00:47:55,692 --> 00:48:01,890
Speaker 0: I'm sort of torn on this situation because on the one hand, it's like, well, I've always been able to afford DS games.

875
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,418
Speaker 0: You know why?

876
00:48:03,438 --> 00:48:05,430
Speaker 0: There's no reason for me to stop buying them now.

877
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:11,990
Speaker 0: And plus, if you buy them, you get the better battery life and the club Nintendo and the club Nintendo and many other things.

878
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,770
Speaker 1: And the box, which you keep an eye long ago, sort of thrown away.

879
00:48:14,971 --> 00:48:15,917
Speaker 0: Yeah.

880
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,669
Speaker 0: There's many reasons to buy this, you know.

881
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:23,950
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, there's a lot of DS games that I sort of glanced at and never bought.

882
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:27,810
Speaker 0: Like I sort of maybe wanted them, but I didn't really want them.

883
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:29,313
Speaker 0: And DS rental.

884
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:37,170
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess, you know, game fly sort of does that and some other places do it, but not really so much.

885
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,490
Speaker 0: I guess you can rent it from Blockbuster, but not really.

886
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:44,289
Speaker 0: So there's some DS games where I kind of thought about buying them and but didn't.

887
00:48:44,731 --> 00:48:48,290
Speaker 0: And there's some DS games where I did buy them and I sort of regret it a little bit.

888
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:49,394
Speaker 0: You know, like dodgeball.

889
00:48:49,414 --> 00:48:50,979
Speaker 0: I mean, we talked about dodgeball.

890
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:53,949
Speaker 0: We did a whole show about it, but we haven't really played it since.

891
00:48:54,572 --> 00:48:55,901
Speaker 0: It hasn't been getting much play.

892
00:48:55,922 --> 00:48:56,888
Speaker 0: I sort of feel like maybe.

893
00:48:57,472 --> 00:49:01,110
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, the single player game, like any dodgeball, there's no single player.

894
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,570
Speaker 1: And while I want to play a multiplayer, there aren't that many people to play with.

895
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:05,354
Speaker 0: Exactly.

896
00:49:05,394 --> 00:49:07,610
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like I probably shouldn't have bought that.

897
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:12,430
Speaker 0: It was, you know, I didn't have to, you know, and there's some other games I want to try out before I buy.

898
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,610
Speaker 0: And this sort of fills that purpose.

899
00:49:14,811 --> 00:49:17,789
Speaker 0: You know, it's like there's the good and the other thing.

900
00:49:18,351 --> 00:49:19,903
Speaker 0: Here's the real thing about this.

901
00:49:19,943 --> 00:49:20,850
Speaker 0: I'm going to get to in a minute.

902
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:26,430
Speaker 0: Like first I went is a game that's out now called Etrian Odyssey two.

903
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,470
Speaker 0: There was an Etrian Odyssey one for DS that I sort of missed.

904
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,809
Speaker 0: I sort of didn't find out about it until the sequel came out.

905
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:34,970
Speaker 0: And this is sort of a, this game is a double edged sword.

906
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:42,210
Speaker 0: On the one hand, it's this awesome game where you have this giant labyrinth, but you have to draw the map on the touch screen.

907
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,779
Speaker 0: That's fucking awesome.

908
00:49:44,001 --> 00:49:45,190
Speaker 0: So awesome, right?

909
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:46,892
Speaker 0: Problem.

910
00:49:46,913 --> 00:49:51,090
Speaker 0: It's a typical JRPG level up kind of game at the same time.

911
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:52,629
Speaker 0: Not awesome.

912
00:49:52,891 --> 00:49:54,343
Speaker 1: Now we're not going to do a full review of that.

913
00:49:54,363 --> 00:49:55,150
Speaker 1: I got to play it first.

914
00:49:56,091 --> 00:50:01,510
Speaker 0: But Alex actually bought the game and he was playing it and he sort of said basically what I thought.

915
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:07,170
Speaker 0: Which is the maze thing is pretty cool, but there is this dungeon crawling bit.

916
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,649
Speaker 0: But the dungeon, the monsters are actually really hard.

917
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:15,090
Speaker 0: So when I got this little homebrew card for the DS, I went and I got this game.

918
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:20,770
Speaker 0: And actually I'm kind of digging it even though it's got this level up bit because the maze bit sort of outshines it.

919
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:27,090
Speaker 1: I really, I mean the thing I love is the idea that the bosses are not, the bosses aren't like normal bosses.

920
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,669
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into it, but I think it's really cool.

921
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,290
Speaker 0: The bosses are just really annoying.

922
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:30,770
Speaker 0: Really?

923
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:31,122
Speaker 0: But yeah.

924
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,570
Speaker 1: The way Alex described them, I thought they were awesome.

925
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:34,568
Speaker 0: Well, you'll see.

926
00:50:37,572 --> 00:50:41,110
Speaker 0: But basically, you know, I sort of was able to learn that I kind of like this game.

927
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:50,230
Speaker 0: And the reason that I can tolerate this game is because the dungeon crawly bit is less of, there are random encounters.

928
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:55,150
Speaker 0: But it's more a resource management thing and less a grind thing.

929
00:50:55,592 --> 00:50:57,630
Speaker 0: You know, it's like you don't have so much gold.

930
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,110
Speaker 0: You never have enough gold ever.

931
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:00,869
Speaker 0: You never have enough health ever.

932
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:02,490
Speaker 0: You never have enough anything.

933
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:06,089
Speaker 0: So you're basically, you're not trying to beat the monsters to level up.

934
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:11,490
Speaker 0: You're just trying to survive and see as much of the maze as you can.

935
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:14,130
Speaker 0: And the monsters are draining your resources.

936
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:18,490
Speaker 0: And the fights are actually ways to sort of manage.

937
00:51:19,012 --> 00:51:23,150
Speaker 0: You know, you're not trying to beat the monsters effectively, even though it's not a bad way to go.

938
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:31,150
Speaker 0: You're trying to get through and get through the maze and accomplish the quests and things and discover as much labyrinth as you can without running out of resources.

939
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:36,790
Speaker 0: And I was able to learn all this, that I kind of like this game from pirating it, basically.

940
00:51:38,531 --> 00:51:44,830
Speaker 0: The other thing about this that I think is far more justifiable than, you know, straight up piracy of DS games, right?

941
00:51:46,892 --> 00:51:53,490
Speaker 0: Is if you live in the US, you can just go online and download Japanese DS roms and vice versa.

942
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:54,650
Speaker 1: So have you touched any witches?

943
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:57,350
Speaker 0: So of course, I go online.

944
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:58,710
Speaker 1: How do you get the witch touching game?

945
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,830
Speaker 0: I'm like, I got to get me a Japanese DS game.

946
00:52:02,092 --> 00:52:02,569
Speaker 0: A witch to touch.

947
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:10,790
Speaker 0: And of course, the first one that I sort of come across, I don't know why, but of course, obviously, if I'm going to get a Japanese DS game.

948
00:52:11,012 --> 00:52:11,970
Speaker 1: It's going to be a witch touching game.

949
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:15,829
Speaker 0: It's going to be Doki Doki Maho Shinpan 2 Witch Touching.

950
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,810
Speaker 1: So did you touch any witches?

951
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:25,450
Speaker 0: You know, Doki Doki Maho Shinpan, playing it was a lot like playing sort of a Tokimeki without the school sim.

952
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,659
Speaker 0: I walk around, characters talk to me.

953
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:29,810
Speaker 0: There's a whole lot of Japanese text I can't read.

954
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,270
Speaker 1: You did not answer my question.

955
00:52:31,392 --> 00:52:32,010
Speaker 0: I'm not done.

956
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:32,990
Speaker 1: Did you touch any witches?

957
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:33,688
Speaker 0: I'll let you know.

958
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,730
Speaker 0: This is the only thing you all want to know.

959
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:37,729
Speaker 0: Well, you're not going to find out unless you let me tell the whole story.

960
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:46,490
Speaker 0: So I'm playing and you talk to people and there's a whole lot of Japanese text and you watch characters reactions on the screen.

961
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,217
Speaker 0: And, you know, it's all right.

962
00:52:48,277 --> 00:52:49,041
Speaker 0: You're going through.

963
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:51,030
Speaker 0: You don't know what's going on because I don't speak Japanese.

964
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,890
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of kanji in there anyway.

965
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,930
Speaker 0: I can't even not that I can read the hiragana.

966
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,870
Speaker 0: And occasionally they'll give you a choice of three things to say.

967
00:52:59,971 --> 00:53:01,343
Speaker 0: And I'll just pick one randomly.

968
00:53:01,363 --> 00:53:02,069
Speaker 0: that looks cool.

969
00:53:02,674 --> 00:53:03,830
Speaker 0: And the characters will react.

970
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,490
Speaker 0: And I keep going around and it's like I go to school.

971
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:09,290
Speaker 0: I touch things, you know, like I look behind things.

972
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,023
Speaker 0: Well, I look behind the blackboard.

973
00:53:11,064 --> 00:53:11,709
Speaker 0: I find a clue.

974
00:53:12,253 --> 00:53:13,870
Speaker 0: It's an investigation game actually.

975
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,790
Speaker 0: You're going around trying to get clues similar to Phoenix, right?

976
00:53:16,932 --> 00:53:18,129
Speaker 0: But not so similar.

977
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:23,147
Speaker 0: And the thing is, I never, I played the game for like a good 30 minutes.

978
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:26,030
Speaker 0: Didn't touch a single witch.

979
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,570
Speaker 0: There was not a single opportunity for witch touching.

980
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:32,190
Speaker 0: So even though this is the witch touching game, you got to play a lot.

981
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,510
Speaker 0: I guess maybe knowing Japanese, I might have been able to touch witches sooner.

982
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:39,670
Speaker 0: But I did not arrive at a single witch touching situation.

983
00:53:40,271 --> 00:53:41,570
Speaker 0: It was all investigation.

984
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:45,510
Speaker 1: That's a little sad, but at the same time it's oddly comforting.

985
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,229
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's sort of like a porno.

986
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:51,568
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you get this plot the whole time and there's a sex scene at the end.

987
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:54,129
Speaker 1: But all you want to do is touch a witch.

988
00:53:54,792 --> 00:53:56,830
Speaker 0: I didn't want to actually play this game.

989
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,240
Speaker 0: I can't understand it or anything.

990
00:53:58,261 --> 00:53:59,490
Speaker 0: I'm getting nothing out of playing it.

991
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:04,630
Speaker 0: The only reason I got the game was to basically see what the witch touching was all about.

992
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:05,677
Speaker 0: So I could comment on it.

993
00:54:05,697 --> 00:54:07,450
Speaker 0: But I have no idea what it's like to touch a witch.

994
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,220
Speaker 1: I can tell you exactly what it's like.

995
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,449
Speaker 1: You touch a witch.

996
00:54:11,137 --> 00:54:11,222
Speaker 0: Yeah.

997
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:12,210
Speaker 1: It is witch touching.

998
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:12,851
Speaker 0: Right.

999
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:13,276
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

1000
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,610
Speaker 0: So, I don't know what the final verdict is.

1001
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:22,930
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm sort of torn about the justifiability of just pirating DS and GBA games.

1002
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,810
Speaker 0: I mean, for some of the games I feel it's okay because it's hard to get the games.

1003
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:27,795
Speaker 0: Maybe they're out of print.

1004
00:54:27,815 --> 00:54:30,210
Speaker 0: Maybe they're old GBA games that aren't around anymore.

1005
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:32,470
Speaker 0: You know, it's a little bit more justifiable.

1006
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:36,268
Speaker 0: Just getting Etrian Odyssey 2, beating it and not playing it.

1007
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:37,836
Speaker 0: Feel a little bad.

1008
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:38,862
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll go buy it.

1009
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:40,330
Speaker 0: I'm thinking because I really like it.

1010
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:44,210
Speaker 0: And I sort of, I'm thinking about starting over in the beginning anyway because I sort of fucked up.

1011
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:47,149
Speaker 0: And I didn't know what I was doing early on and I died a lot.

1012
00:54:47,711 --> 00:54:48,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, no manual.

1013
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:49,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, no manual.

1014
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:50,710
Speaker 0: It kind of sucks.

1015
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:59,709
Speaker 0: So, you know, if you have a DS and you're like a high school kid, you should probably totally get one of these things, whichever one you can get your hands on.

1016
00:55:00,472 --> 00:55:12,550
Speaker 0: If you have money, man, you have an iPod, you don't really need one of these things, but you could get it to sort of test the waters of DS and GBA games you're thinking about getting, maybe.

1017
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:14,389
Speaker 0: You know, just sort of test them out.

1018
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:20,507
Speaker 0: If you want to save a lot of money because you're poor, you should probably get one of these and you could have mad fun on your DS.

1019
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:26,370
Speaker 0: I mean, sure, sort of hard to justify the piracy, but whatever, you're poor.

1020
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:32,150
Speaker 1: The real point is there's very little use for these things other than piracy, so don't kid yourself.

1021
00:55:32,571 --> 00:55:33,377
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

1022
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,330
Speaker 0: It's a pirating machine.

1023
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:42,890
Speaker 0: The only things it does well are play DS and GBA games sort of natively, ROMs of DS and GBA games natively.

1024
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:44,479
Speaker 0: It does a lot of other things.

1025
00:55:44,901 --> 00:55:46,450
Speaker 0: It doesn't do them well.

1026
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:51,430
Speaker 0: It does them half acid and hackily, which a high schooler could tolerate.

1027
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:55,470
Speaker 0: Maybe someone without a lot of money could tolerate, someone with an iPod could tolerate.

1028
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:57,174
Speaker 0: I can't tolerate it.

1029
00:55:57,716 --> 00:56:01,870
Speaker 0: I pretty much, you know, I played with it, used every feature on it.

1030
00:56:02,912 --> 00:56:05,510
Speaker 0: I'm pretty much only ever going to use it for DS and GBA games.

1031
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:17,930
Speaker 0: And actually what I did is I went and I downloaded a bunch of old GBA games that are not easily available and I've been trying to play those, you know, games that I would never pay money for and just want to see, like play them for 30 seconds.

1032
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,769
Speaker 0: Like I played Mario Pinball for 30 seconds.

1033
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:20,990
Speaker 1: That's about all that was worth.

1034
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,485
Speaker 0: I played Pokémon Pinball for 30 seconds.

1035
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,009
Speaker 1: I'll bet that was worth the same 30 seconds.

1036
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, I played Yu-Gi-Oh, one of the Yu-Gi-Oh games.

1037
00:56:28,186 --> 00:56:28,670
Speaker 0: Bad.

1038
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,149
Speaker 0: You know, that sort of thing, just to see what the deal is.

1039
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:36,130
Speaker 0: And I think it's, you know, it was worth buying the price I paid for it.

1040
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,235
Speaker 0: I think I paid 80 bucks.

1041
00:56:37,295 --> 00:56:37,577
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1042
00:56:37,597 --> 00:56:38,461
Speaker 0: Maybe I got ripped off.

1043
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:39,365
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter.

1044
00:56:39,406 --> 00:56:40,210
Speaker 0: I could afford it.

1045
00:56:40,491 --> 00:56:40,732
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1046
00:56:41,216 --> 00:56:42,546
Speaker 1: I'm glad I didn't buy it at the con.

1047
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,050
Speaker 1: I'll hold out.

1048
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,949
Speaker 1: I'm going to hold out until the technology gets better, until I can actually use it.

1049
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,870
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing is that this has been the same technology for a couple of years now.

1050
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,202
Speaker 0: It's not really going anywhere.

1051
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:51,050
Speaker 0: It's sort of leveled out.

1052
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:51,672
Speaker 0: You know what?

1053
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:56,070
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll just install Nesticle or, well, I guess modern emulators.

1054
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:57,286
Speaker 0: Well, what you can do is you can go get...

1055
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,375
Speaker 1: On my laptop.

1056
00:56:58,797 --> 00:57:00,810
Speaker 1: And I'll just play ROMs on my laptop.

1057
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:08,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can just totally get a GBA or DS emulator for your computer and plug in a controller and go at it if you don't want to.

1058
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,209
Speaker 0: The only reason to do this is for the...

1059
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:10,690
Speaker 1: Is to touch witches.

1060
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,109
Speaker 0: Is for the DS-ness and the touch screen-iness.

1061
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,290
Speaker 1: And the touching of witches.

1062
00:57:14,637 --> 00:57:14,850
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1063
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:15,795
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

1064
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:17,990
Speaker 1: Tomorrow night, coverage of Kinetic Con.

1065
00:57:18,512 --> 00:57:18,753
Speaker 0: Yep.

1066
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:23,489
Speaker 0: I'm going to try the Wii homebrew soon and I'll give you a report on that after I play with it.

1067
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,349
Speaker 1: You mean a witch.

1068
00:57:25,673 --> 00:57:25,790
Speaker 1: Right.

1069
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,869
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any witch touching on the Wii.

1070
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,719
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rem and Scott.

1071
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,360
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1073
00:57:51,882 --> 00:57:57,540

1074
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,619
Speaker 1: Mondays are science and technology.

1075
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,200
Speaker 1: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1076
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,820
Speaker 1: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights.

1077
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,159
Speaker 1: And Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1078

Speaker 0: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com.

Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1086
00:58:46,962 --> 00:58:50,080
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
