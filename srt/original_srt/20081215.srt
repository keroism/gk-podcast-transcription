1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,567
Speaker 1: It's Monday December 15th.

2
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:12,249
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,696
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:15,800
Speaker 1: portable words.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:33,692
Speaker 0: You know I'm pretty good with the with the softwares.

7
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:35,658
Speaker 0: You know it's that's sort of what I do.

8
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:39,240
Speaker 0: You know make softwares, but for many moons.

9
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:42,556
Speaker 0: You know the physical bits the electronics have sort of.

10
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:43,500
Speaker 0: you know mystified.

11
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:49,167
Speaker 0: You know it's like I can stick a video card in an AGP slot And I can understand.

12
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:52,580
Speaker 0: you know the abstracted metaphors for how these technologies work.

13
00:00:53,224 --> 00:01:03,084
Speaker 0: And now when I understand on a fundamental level that there You know pins and electricity and the electricity goes on and it goes off, and there's like these square waves You know if it's at five volts It's one.

14
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,959
Speaker 0: if it's zero volts at zero, but it'll thing.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,900
Speaker 1: But I'm guessing if someone handed you a pile of resistors and such and with said without Google make a flip-flop.

16
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:12,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

17
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:22,458
Speaker 0: I know PV equals nRT But if you give me a calculator that even though I know that it won't help me for shit cuz I don't know I only know what the V is I?

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,127
Speaker 0: Don't know what the n RT or P's are.

19
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:32,084
Speaker 1: the problem is what will stop most people is the lost art of looking at a resistor And knowing the resistance.

20
00:01:32,104 --> 00:01:38,184
Speaker 0: see I know that there are colors and that they mean something right and I know that those colors match up With a number of ohms.

21
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:45,127
Speaker 0: I could not tell you which one of those letters in the in the equation is the ohms so That I'm sort of lost.

22
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:47,959
Speaker 1: I almost feel worse because I was kind of a hobbyist.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm when I say hobbyist I'm like I can make a circuit like I know the electricity goes from the.

24
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:54,376
Speaker 0: you know the positive to the ground.

25
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:58,253
Speaker 1: well well No, the electrons come out of the negative.

26
00:01:58,574 --> 00:01:59,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know you connect it.

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,402
Speaker 0: This is circuit.

28
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:01,225
Speaker 0: it goes in a circle.

29
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:04,897
Speaker 0: I know how it works right, but it you know I don't.

30
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,065
Speaker 0: I Can't actually do it.

31
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:07,668
Speaker 0: You know even though.

32
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:10,740
Speaker 0: I worked with like James who does this for a living for like you know?

33
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,160
Speaker 0: I guess 20 weeks, and I didn't learn enough.

34
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,700
Speaker 0: I mean I learned but not enough to actually do anything.

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,589
Speaker 0: But basically the extent of my electronics was you know I?

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:30,600
Speaker 0: Wrote some C code that turned one pin on the motherboard like on and I connected a thing to it so I could detect Like I could detect if it was a one or a zero, but that's as basically software.

37
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,333
Speaker 0: I didn't actually do any electronics all right.

38
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:33,300
Speaker 0: everyone else did all that.

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:46,807
Speaker 1: No, I feel like I'm kind of in a worse situation because I used to be really into that like in middle school elementary school I was soldering stuff all over the place and inside Stuff at summer camp Completely forgot how to do it like.

40
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:48,174
Speaker 1: I made a really like.

41
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:49,540
Speaker 1: I made an alarm system for my bed.

42
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:51,679
Speaker 0: I also made an alarm system with two buttons.

43
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:53,286
Speaker 1: Oh see mine wasn't buttons.

44
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:56,540
Speaker 1: mine actually was if the circuit was broken it went off.

45
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,986
Speaker 0: Well the button was broken.

46
00:02:58,027 --> 00:02:59,433
Speaker 0: the circuit was broken by a button.

47
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:00,317
Speaker 1: see mine was just.

48
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:00,900
Speaker 1: I had a wire.

49
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,573
Speaker 1: I wired it into the door frame.

50
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:03,540
Speaker 0: well see mine.

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,966
Speaker 0: I made it and it was sort of loose.

52
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,980
Speaker 0: so right and one button was sort of like the arming button.

53
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,099
Speaker 0: It was one of those clicky ones like it locks in.

54
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:14,242
Speaker 0: So if you lock that button in then it was armed and if you unlocked it It was off.

55
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:17,960
Speaker 0: there's also a power switch right and then there was a very loose button.

56
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,668
Speaker 0: It was like one of those silent sort of.

57
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:20,251
Speaker 0: you know you could.

58
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:22,200
Speaker 0: it would get pushed if you like tapped it a little bit.

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,733
Speaker 0: Yeah, yep, and so if it got pushed past a certain point It would cut it and then in the alarm was set.

60
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:31,632
Speaker 1: so there was basically a current Going across where the door is and the window.

61
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:33,340
Speaker 1: and if the voltage?

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I could have done the same exact thing.

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,663
Speaker 0: Just you know by taking the wires off getting longer wires and putting different switches on instead of using switches I set it up to where.

64
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:45,480
Speaker 1: if the voltage dropped across that whole why could he just use like magnet switches?

65
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:49,667
Speaker 0: You know what the magnets are closed to each other, but then when they move up that cuts it, and that's it You know.

66
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:54,800
Speaker 1: yeah But do you remember how to make a circuit where if you lose signal on one wire the other wire?

67
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,219
Speaker 0: I know when I made this thing I was in summer camp But I had a little chart.

68
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:07,166
Speaker 0: And you know even though we even made the boards there like we drew on the boards of the magic marker And they were just copper and then they put him in acid for us And they came out.

69
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:08,535
Speaker 0: and then you know the tree.

70
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:09,340
Speaker 1: we didn't get to do that.

71
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,119
Speaker 1: I just had piles of bread boards that I periodically broke.

72
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:15,494
Speaker 0: See I could use a bread board to practice some soldering on.

73
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:18,630
Speaker 1: so I remember very specifically I was saying it's soldering.

74
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:20,060
Speaker 0: I got taught by an Australian guy.

75
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:29,897
Speaker 1: I was in like third grade and then I forgot I was soldering something together And I was following this diagram and the the friendly gnome I knew who taught me how to solder and taught me how to do all this stuff.

76
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,519
Speaker 1: no But this this man was the closest thing to a gnome that the real world has ever seen.

77
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,632
Speaker 1: Him and his whole family were gnomes.

78
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:42,080
Speaker 1: they lived in a house That was nothing more than a giant engineering project lived in a tree.

79
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:47,640
Speaker 1: They were all and they rode on a. him and his wife and his daughter red triangle hat.

80
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:51,590
Speaker 1: Him his wife and his daughter were all engineers for a living.

81
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,195
Speaker 1: they both had him and his wife.

82
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,800
Speaker 1: both had doctorates in engineering.

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,304
Speaker 1: I forget what.

84
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:56,999
Speaker 0: David the gnome rode around on fuck.

85
00:04:57,742 --> 00:05:02,660
Speaker 1: This is the guy who would hand me two wires and say you may feel a shock don't.

86
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:08,369
Speaker 1: But I remember I was in soldering something together.

87
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,413
Speaker 1: he's like can you read a schematic?

88
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:10,156
Speaker 1: and I'm like.

89
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,727
Speaker 1: yes Yes, I can.

90
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,074
Speaker 1: and he's like really.

91
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,907
Speaker 1: so he shows me a schematic He's like does this look like?

92
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,635
Speaker 1: what you think a schematic is now is like.

93
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:23,289
Speaker 1: no No, I'm using this and he's like that's a diagram.

94
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,215
Speaker 1: This is a schematic sit down boy, and you're going to learn ha electronics actually work, so

95
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:41,138
Speaker 0: I went and There's this Arduino thing right which is basically like this open-source Board and there are plenty of other plenty of other like boards and chips you can get that you can program stuff on.

96
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:47,648
Speaker 0: there's like There's like basic stamps and all these other things right there basically Chips that are really easy to program.

97
00:05:47,668 --> 00:06:06,780
Speaker 0: you connect it to your computer with a serial port you write some software You push a button the software goes over to the chip and then the chip is connected to a board and then there's like some pins on the board and you can program whether they go on or off and then there's some other ones That are input so you can detect whether the in what's coming in is on or off and then you can make things happen.

98
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,101
Speaker 0: Right.

99
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:10,813
Speaker 0: so this Arduino one is like these super open-source one.

100
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:15,020
Speaker 0: You know it's not like super powerful It's not like the best thing ever.

101
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,539
Speaker 0: It's you know it's limited, but it's super open-source and super everything like that and works with USB.

102
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:30,944
Speaker 0: So I went to like to make magazine store And I bought like the whole thing and then I went to some other places And I bought all the other stuff, and I pretty much have everything now except I actually need some solder.

103
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:32,309
Speaker 0: I got to go to some Radio Shack.

104
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:33,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know it's solder.

105
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:42,316
Speaker 1: right yeah, but I got Okay, as long as you admit that it is actually solder, which you just did, but I'm Australian now.

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,125
Speaker 1: Oh Are you?

107
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:45,597
Speaker 0: yes, I got a solder.

108
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:52,260
Speaker 1: So the circuits what's the capital of Australia, Melbourne, okay, yeah anyway?

109
00:06:55,904 --> 00:06:58,420
Speaker 0: Right so I got all this stuff, and I can learn how to use it.

110
00:06:58,582 --> 00:06:59,560
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be all dangerous.

111
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:09,719
Speaker 0: And then maybe one day I will make something that will you know sort of appear on all the websites like oh my god guy Makes you know small version of something.

112
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:13,411
Speaker 0: Guy makes this piece of technology.

113
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:15,100
Speaker 0: talk to this other piece of technology.

114
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,979
Speaker 0: There's another.

115
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:24,480
Speaker 1: It really depends which website you get on because the article headline might be guy solders finger to other finger found dead.

116
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,216
Speaker 0: I thought that's gonna happen.

117
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:36,133
Speaker 1: I can say one thing I did once drip hot solder Into my thumbnail once like between the nail and the finger mmm.

118
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,820
Speaker 1: That was possibly the worst experience of my life.

119
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:43,027
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not gonna happen But I have to.

120
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:50,020
Speaker 0: I need to get like it like a. I think I'm just gonna take some of the old things we have Lying around that's that are crappy and try to practice the soldering on them.

121
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:50,764
Speaker 1: You know you can do.

122
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,634
Speaker 1: I got that old motherboard with all the busted caps.

123
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:54,124
Speaker 1: you should take them all off and put them back On.

124
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,339
Speaker 0: I could try that.

125
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:04,396
Speaker 0: The thing is that all the soldering I have to do is through the hole and a lot of stuff on modern Technology is surface mount and surface mount is like very hard and also.

126
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,858
Speaker 0: I'm never gonna do anything I'm only gonna do through the hole, so I don't know.

127
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,920
Speaker 1: Anyway, well I can say one thing if you're not worried about it actually working you can treat all those as through the hole.

128
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:15,348
Speaker 0: I guess that's true.

129
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:17,260
Speaker 0: I just poke holes in it.

130
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,089
Speaker 1: No There are things because they're not the little Tiny goings that are on the side or surface mount.

131
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,220
Speaker 1: the big ones on my old a bit motherboard are through the hole effective really.

132
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,487
Speaker 0: So I could like in the hole.

133
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know through the hole you could do it.

134
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:31,852
Speaker 0: anyway I got a you know what.

135
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,383
Speaker 1: well I got.

136
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:40,337
Speaker 0: go buy like a pack of resistors that are like you know less than a cent each And they're just like sold to the mall to a thing full of holes.

137
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:48,760
Speaker 1: just to practice You know I like the idea of what you know getting a house and all that and then trying to make the whole house Super awesomely automated like a lot of yeah, but it's a lot.

138
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:51,140
Speaker 0: You know that you know it's much easier.

139
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,136
Speaker 0: Just buy something that does that rather than try to make all.

140
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:56,840
Speaker 1: yes to a point But you buy the things that do the basic things.

141
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,943
Speaker 1: But if you want to do the one complicated thing for which no one made a simple thing That's true.

142
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,088
Speaker 1: Then you got to do this.

143
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,418
Speaker 0: actually I was thinking of one thing that might be cool.

144
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:05,699
Speaker 0: right?

145
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:13,900
Speaker 0: is You get a Wi-Fi thing right and you get the chip and a battery or you connect it to the wall or whatever right?

146
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:33,314
Speaker 0: and basically have a switch like physical switches for all the people who live in your house right like maybe three-way switches and then LEDs and then you just write their name on it And then you flick a switch and it will like connect to the jabber and be like so when you leave the house you could Just be like away with a switch.

147
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:38,597
Speaker 0: Huh when you come back call me be like home and it will just change it.

148
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,072
Speaker 1: by that logic Why don't you just have an app on your iPhone?

149
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,260
Speaker 0: that that's what I'm saying.

150
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,978
Speaker 1: You know a series of presets like left the house or even better the night tie it to the GPS.

151
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:51,396
Speaker 1: the main problem When you get home, it just says rims.

152
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:52,847
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I thought of that.

153
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:57,971
Speaker 0: you know what the problem is because the iPhone doesn't have any sort of multitasking or background tasking.

154
00:09:58,172 --> 00:10:09,460
Speaker 0: you would actually have to go turn on the iPhone Go to the app push the buttons while this internet around and then like, you know Turn off the iPhone and like you have to wait for the GPS to get your location.

155
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:11,207
Speaker 0: It's like you have to do all this stuff.

156
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:13,055
Speaker 0: There's a lot more work than flicking us away.

157
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,160
Speaker 1: So, you know, this is the problem.

158
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,920
Speaker 1: We're so close to having all the things I've wanted my whole life.

159
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,783
Speaker 1: Did she want?

160
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,374
Speaker 0: yeah get the get the g1 from t-mobile, you know what?

161
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,760
Speaker 0: the battery doesn't last all day.

162
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:26,192
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it sits there all day doing all that shit that you wanted to do.

163
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:27,737
Speaker 1: That's why I just gotta wait.

164
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,955
Speaker 0: Yep Maybe the zinc air batteries that they're talking about will help you.

165
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:33,938
Speaker 1: We'll see.

166
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,866
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright, so check this out, right?

167
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:38,331
Speaker 0: There's a the.

168
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,060
Speaker 0: there's been a recent hub of mostly today.

169
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:45,120
Speaker 0: It's sort of been like the comeback of net neutrality as an issue, right?

170
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:55,019
Speaker 0: and basically what's happened here is the Wall Street Journal and some other people have sort of Not understood what net neutrality means.

171
00:10:56,482 --> 00:11:01,237
Speaker 0: So I feel I have to re-explain this to everyone to make sure that it's clear right.

172
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:06,232
Speaker 0: so Originally, this is where net neutrality first became an issue.

173
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:07,236
Speaker 0: was this right?

174
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:14,780
Speaker 0: I Go to someone who sells internet internet service provider, maybe the cable company the phone company someone else, right?

175
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,403
Speaker 0: I get a connection.

176
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:18,390
Speaker 0: It's a t1 whatever right?

177
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,658
Speaker 0: It's so many megabits per second.

178
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,200
Speaker 0: Okay?

179
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:25,255
Speaker 0: They I pay for the t1.

180
00:11:26,182 --> 00:11:27,286
Speaker 0: That's all I pay for.

181
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:32,590
Speaker 0: if I use it a lot or if I use it a little bit I pay The same right?

182
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:33,233
Speaker 0: It doesn't.

183
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:34,360
Speaker 0: it doesn't change, right?

184
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:48,660
Speaker 0: What they wanted to do was what what some of the internet service providers want to do is They wanted to say hey look right, you know on the other end of the internet service, right?

185
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,005
Speaker 0: So I'm on this end with my t1.

186
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:58,253
Speaker 0: on the other end is Google, right if I visit Google Right, then Google's data is going over their line.

187
00:11:58,313 --> 00:12:00,500
Speaker 0: So they feel like they should be able to charge Google.

188
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:08,363
Speaker 0: They are charging Google Google's paying for internet connections on its side to some you know to someone else and then it's just this big Network.

189
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:10,519
Speaker 1: everyone pretty much just boils down to that.

190
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:23,540
Speaker 1: pretty much everyone who knows about the technology agrees that the ISPs and the high-level providers and the internet itself Should be completely agnostic to the content and the originator of the content.

191
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:30,593
Speaker 0: Yes, so what they wanted to do is they wanted to say, all right, look, you know Google You should pay us, you know more because you're using more of our bandwidth.

192
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:35,860
Speaker 0: or they were gonna say, all right, look Everyone we're still gonna let all the traffic go through.

193
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,200
Speaker 0: So if you visit Google, it'll still make it to the other side.

194
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:43,694
Speaker 0: But if Google pays us money Then it'll be faster for you people to visit Google.

195
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,060
Speaker 0: then it'll be for you to visit.

196
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:48,311
Speaker 0: You know say Yahoo, right unless Yahoo also pays us money.

197
00:12:48,692 --> 00:13:04,160
Speaker 0: So what that would be is actually It's not net neutral because different things you are visiting are getting like You know preferential treatment and the other things that you are visiting are getting sort of demoted, right?

198
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,479
Speaker 0: So the actual what is going over the lines is being discriminated against right?

199
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,086
Speaker 0: Basically what happened here right?

200
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:13,631
Speaker 0: is Google said hey look here.

201
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:17,344
Speaker 0: We got a plan here called open edge I think is there.

202
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,131
Speaker 0: is there a profit?

203
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:28,720
Speaker 0: the name of their plan here and The idea For Google's thing was that they were gonna put servers.

204
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:36,120
Speaker 0: They wanted to pay ISPs to put their Google servers, you know co-locate them at the ISP.

205
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:39,880
Speaker 0: So I use we have Cablevision here right Optima online.

206
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:45,300
Speaker 0: So instead of Google getting preferential treatment on the networking side, right?

207
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,660
Speaker 0: What would happen is Google would just put a server at Cablevision and then they wouldn't get any preferential treatment.

208
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:58,020
Speaker 0: But it would just be faster because Google has the server right there instead of it going all the way to you know Mountain View, California, or wherever it is, right?

209
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,679
Speaker 0: So that's perfectly net neutral as long as anyone who can afford it is also allowed to.

210
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:05,958
Speaker 0: you know Put servers there.

211
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:16,140
Speaker 0: so What happened is, you know, Google came out with this and you know, Larry Lessig Who's a who's a net neutrality supporter came out and said that was cool.

212
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:21,660
Speaker 0: But all these other people who misunderstood it were like, oh, you know, I thought you guys are for net neutrality.

213
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,643
Speaker 0: Now you're against it.

214
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:27,320
Speaker 0: given Google preferential treatment, you know, you know, why should Google be faster?

215
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:29,447
Speaker 0: It's like it's not.

216
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,852
Speaker 0: it is net neutral.

217
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:32,860
Speaker 0: They're putting up servers in a different place.

218
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,120
Speaker 0: We're not modifying the network to make Google packets go faster and other people's packets go slower.

219
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:44,191
Speaker 0: We're just putting Google servers out there And as long as anyone who can afford it can do the same thing.

220
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:49,990
Speaker 1: because at the same time ISPs do have the discretion to.

221
00:14:50,131 --> 00:15:03,140
Speaker 1: if you're gonna host a server to Refuse to do business with people on various reasons Like for example, if someone's the known spammer lost ISPs if they find out we'll say look No, you can't use our service and all the spammers then up on those shady ISPs.

222
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:12,408
Speaker 0: Oh you want to see that there's a difference between Spamming and putting out viruses where you're sort of violating You know the the terms of service and whatnot.

223
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:24,856
Speaker 1: and as opposed to just what I'm putting out a podcast that they don't like What if I just make a terms of service that I update every time I get a customer I like that says I only offer this to these specific companies and no one else.

224
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:25,940
Speaker 0: that's not net neutral.

225
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,727
Speaker 0: It's not cool.

226
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,080
Speaker 1: But what's the specific line?

227
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:28,622
Speaker 1: What?

228
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,250
Speaker 1: what am I allowed to discriminate against?

229
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,400
Speaker 1: and what am I not allowed to discriminate against?

230
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,873
Speaker 0: You're allowed to discriminate against spam and illegal things not like.

231
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:39,680
Speaker 1: what is what is spam?

232
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,780
Speaker 0: Unsolicited emails.

233
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:45,965
Speaker 1: Alright, so how do you know for sure?

234
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,929
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

235
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:47,872
Speaker 0: How do I know for sure?

236
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:48,836
Speaker 0: It's obvious.

237
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:49,960
Speaker 1: Is it really though?

238
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, a new company.

239
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,800
Speaker 1: They have you you know, they their name isn't Google anywhere.

240
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:56,559
Speaker 1: They're a fresh new company and they want to buy hosting with you.

241
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,387
Speaker 1: All right, they're actually spammers.

242
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:00,210
Speaker 1: they start spamming.

243
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:03,220
Speaker 0: I look at the emails which are perfectly visible.

244
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:04,369
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

245
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:05,055
Speaker 1: you look at the emails?

246
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:05,640
Speaker 1: What do you look for?

247
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,963
Speaker 0: Viagra's OG.

248
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:17,539
Speaker 0: I wonder or hey, look, I'm getting a bunch of emails to abuse at me and they all say hey I'm getting fucking spam from you bitches.

249
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:22,780
Speaker 1: All right, but spam in many cases is not actually illegal if it's done in certain ways.

250
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,269
Speaker 1: So where are you gonna draw the line?

251
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,940
Speaker 0: because Eddie legal spam?

252
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:36,776
Speaker 1: Okay, so the only way the only thing you can possibly discriminate against if you're an ISP is If the thing that they want to do is actually directly illegal.

253
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:40,819
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright, what if you don't you ran out of rack space?

254
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,699
Speaker 1: We mean somebody one more person wants to buy a service and you don't have any more rack space.

255
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:48,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know more.

256
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:56,116
Speaker 0: it's that's like if someone wants to buy a banana and I'm the girls All the bananas so I may I buy I have one you of rack space.

257
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:57,079
Speaker 1: I sell it to Google's.

258
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,722
Speaker 1: now I'm full.

259
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,610
Speaker 1: All right, is that okay?

260
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,900
Speaker 0: You sell it to first come first serve.

261
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:06,160
Speaker 1: I open I make the rack space for Google and then I don't make any more.

262
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:09,671
Speaker 0: See, but we're not talking about making rack space for people.

263
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:10,935
Speaker 0: We're talking about co-location.

264
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:12,382
Speaker 1: Yes co-location So they co.

265
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:19,019
Speaker 1: look I allow Google to co-locate in the one cubby hole that I have free for co-location And now it's full that no one else can do it.

266
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,440
Speaker 0: That's fine because you're not doing anything on the network side.

267
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:32,379
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what I was saying because it sounded like you were saying that if I offer a service to anyone as an ISP I have to offer it to everyone no matter what unless it's illegal, but it sounds like now that's not the case.

268
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,150
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's just you know, I was just talking to.

269
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,538
Speaker 0: but net neutrality is about the network.

270
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:39,190
Speaker 1: Yes That's not what I'm trying to make.

271
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:44,071
Speaker 0: it's not about you know Who puts servers where anyone could put servers anywhere they want to.

272
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:45,074
Speaker 0: it's about the network.

273
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:46,860
Speaker 0: You shouldn't filter packets.

274
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:51,440
Speaker 0: You shouldn't you know make some packets slower in some packets faster.

275
00:17:52,042 --> 00:18:01,732
Speaker 0: All the packets are just treated as faceless packets headed towards their destination and they get sent to their destination With you know, the best possible service available.

276
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:03,620
Speaker 1: So how do I do QoS though?

277
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,652
Speaker 1: What if what if my network gets saturated and not everything's gonna get through?

278
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,780
Speaker 0: am I allowed to you just do it evenly?

279
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:11,520
Speaker 1: What do you mean evenly though?

280
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:21,587
Speaker 1: That doesn't really work so well because UDP versus TCP taking it evenly from TCP will greatly affect performance while taking it evenly from UDP, especially if it's like streaming video.

281
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:22,551
Speaker 0: Yes, but you are.

282
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:28,714
Speaker 0: if you're doing a TCP versus UDP thing Then you're doing a fair and even thing across.

283
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:32,187
Speaker 0: you're not discriminating by Content or by who it is.

284
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:35,740
Speaker 0: So the line emanating by it's all TCP and all UDP.

285
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:44,031
Speaker 1: So it's okay to discriminate at layer three or four but not layer five or layer Based on people or content.

286
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:46,018
Speaker 0: you're just you know, it's just across the board.

287
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:46,520
Speaker 1: It's the content.

288
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:48,780
Speaker 1: It's the content of the layer two packet.

289
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,790
Speaker 0: But it's not the what they're doing.

290
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,220
Speaker 0: It's not Skype versus eBay versus Google.

291
00:18:54,461 --> 00:18:57,772
Speaker 0: It's you know, it it's just you know, it's all.

292
00:18:57,893 --> 00:18:59,980
Speaker 0: UDP needs to slow down because we don't have any more.

293
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:08,343
Speaker 1: Alright, so I just completely throttled UDP Which will screw up a lot of the a lot of these shady peer-to-peer things and Happens to.

294
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:10,374
Speaker 0: but it's all UDP and it's you're not.

295
00:19:10,414 --> 00:19:11,319
Speaker 0: you're not cutting it.

296
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:13,366
Speaker 1: You're Equally, so I'm just here.

297
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:15,419
Speaker 1: I'm allowed to discriminate against all UDP.

298
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,604
Speaker 0: Am I allowed to?

299
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:27,280
Speaker 0: you can't do it, but if you you know, if you're if you're net where you got to manage your network Yes, so am I allowed to discriminate against all port 9008?

300
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,726
Speaker 1: Regardless of content, I'm just see.

301
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:29,590
Speaker 1: here's here's the point.

302
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,775
Speaker 1: I'm trying to make no.

303
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:36,110
Speaker 1: net neutrality Is very difficult to define from a legal perspective.

304
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,314
Speaker 1: This is the biggest issue.

305
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:39,400
Speaker 1: Is that how do you specify in?

306
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,598
Speaker 1: legalese in an unambiguous way what is allowed and what is not?

307
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:46,555
Speaker 1: because Technologists like I can look at it and say that's neutral.

308
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:47,520
Speaker 1: That's not that's neutral.

309
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,080
Speaker 1: That's not and it's obvious to me and most text would agree with me, but that doesn't really fly in a court of law.

310
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,204
Speaker 1: I mean the whole.

311
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:55,709
Speaker 1: is it pornography?

312
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,816
Speaker 1: Well, I know it when I see it.

313
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:58,779
Speaker 1: That's BS.

314
00:20:00,423 --> 00:20:02,220
Speaker 1: That does that works even less for technology.

315
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:09,519
Speaker 1: So, how can we fight for net neutrality if we can't define what it truly is on a very specific logical unambiguous level?

316
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:24,520
Speaker 0: Is true in a way But the point is is people need to understand, you know, what exactly like when these issues come up, you know Like you got to really pay attention and you know, think about what's being said and what's going on.

317
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:30,200
Speaker 0: You know, it's really common sense once you understand even like a little bit what you know.

318
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,440
Speaker 0: The issue the current issue is like what's fair and what's not fair, you know, and what would be okay?

319
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,664
Speaker 0: And what would not be okay?

320
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:41,860
Speaker 0: It's like is it okay for Google to pay someone to put a server somewhere?

321
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:49,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, is it okay for someone to make Google go faster and to make something else go slower, you know, Yahoo goes slower.

322
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,008
Speaker 1: What's the line between like?

323
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:56,238
Speaker 1: do you do based on like one layer of ISP versus another layer?

324
00:20:56,258 --> 00:21:01,180
Speaker 1: and what if I Buy a t1 for myself and I sell it to my two neighbors and it's just our little network?

325
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:04,620
Speaker 1: Am I allowed to discriminate against their stuff even though they're paying me?

326
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:08,528
Speaker 0: It's a tough question exactly.

327
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:08,789
Speaker 0: I guess.

328
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:15,260
Speaker 0: if you're a company you can definitely do it and It depends on what your agreement is with your neighbors, but an ISP is just a company.

329
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:24,099
Speaker 1: So all the all the customers who sign up for ISPs the agreement just says yeah, if you use peer-to-peer We'll I would are you I would agree with that.

330
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,147
Speaker 0: Possibly that right.

331
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:27,351
Speaker 0: the problem with that.

332
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,478
Speaker 1: So, you know the problem with that is twofold.

333
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:32,660
Speaker 1: number one I'll get to a false advertising of the I.

334
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:37,440
Speaker 0: Wait, no, there's the other issue the monopoly of the ISPs.

335
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:41,235
Speaker 0: you often do not have a choice in broadband ISP.

336
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:47,714
Speaker 0: if I could choose between FiOS cable vision whatever then maybe it would be okay for them to.

337
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:54,398
Speaker 0: you know start doing shit, but Because I have no other choice You know, that's reasonable, you know, we can't be.

338
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:59,500
Speaker 0: you know It needs to be treated like utility and not treated like that's it because it's not just false advertising.

339
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,060
Speaker 0: That's why you know, the phone system is so heavily regulated because in 99% of places you don't have a choice.

340
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,578
Speaker 0: It's you get Verizon because you live here, but it's not just.

341
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:13,560
Speaker 1: I mean Looking at the false advertising perspective Even if it's not technically false advertising.

342
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:19,260
Speaker 1: The fact is that every ISP basically makes their terms of service say that they can do anything at any time for any reason.

343
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:21,797
Speaker 1: Yep, but then again, how do we stop that?

344
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,559
Speaker 1: Of course the easy way to stop that is to allow competition in some way.

345
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:31,097
Speaker 0: I mean our ISP started doing the stupid DNS thing and they also started doing.

346
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:35,774
Speaker 0: they've always blocked I think port 25 unless you pay for the business thing, but that's all they do.

347
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,419
Speaker 0: Otherwise, they're cool for now.

348
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:43,925
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the only reason we haven't had issues is that as far as I can tell none of our neighbors really are internet People.

349
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:55,720
Speaker 0: no, not really Far more bandwidth and we should be getting yeah, the real the real thing that goes on here right is that You know you the the ISP gets an internet connection from someone else, right?

350
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,870
Speaker 0: They buy an OC 3 let's say right and then they want to sell that to everyone in town.

351
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,926
Speaker 0: now Yeah, let's say the OC 3.

352
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:06,098
Speaker 0: I don't know how much bandwidth does it have like a hundred two hundred something like that.

353
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,230
Speaker 0: a lot Right, but they've got a hundred customers.

354
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,138
Speaker 0: They if they give each customer one, right?

355
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,691
Speaker 0: That's only a hundred customers for an OS.

356
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:18,393
Speaker 0: for one OC 3 That means each customer has to pay hundreds of dollars a month.

357
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:19,357
Speaker 0: not gonna happen.

358
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:22,978
Speaker 0: No, no No, and the thing is even if they do that, right?

359
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:25,886
Speaker 0: They're not gonna use all of the OC 3.

360
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:33,462
Speaker 0: I mean Every single customer would have to bit tour it full on at the exact same time for the OC 3 to be used up Snake.

361
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:41,634
Speaker 0: and the way to make money on this right is if you just if you actually have enough bandwidth to Support every customer going full-on all the time.

362
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:45,187
Speaker 0: You're losing money You're not or your customers are paying way too much.

363
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:50,187
Speaker 1: See the problem is everyone always advertises unlimited internet with a tiny asterisk Yep.

364
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:57,489
Speaker 0: So what you have to do is you have to buy a hundred megabits of bandwidth and then sell More than a hundred megabits of bandwidth.

365
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:57,931
Speaker 0: you to sell.

366
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:02,112
Speaker 0: it's like a thousand customers giving them ten each But at the same time percent of the time.

367
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:03,380
Speaker 0: it'll be just fine.

368
00:24:03,446 --> 00:24:10,860
Speaker 1: No but the problem is that as our society is more technological more people are Utilizing the resource that is given to them in the manner that they expect.

369
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:19,423
Speaker 0: But they're not using it a hundred percent and it's economically infeasible to actually be forced to be able to handle a hundred percent Capacity.

370
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:22,420
Speaker 1: Yes, but at the same time, what do we do when we're basically?

371
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:31,749
Speaker 1: The there's no way to handle this situation because no one is willing to pay what it actually costs and yet at the same time There's the monopolies.

372
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,020
Speaker 1: You don't have any choice regardless.

373
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:34,372
Speaker 1: What do we do?

374
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:37,072
Speaker 0: You gotta?

375
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:52,139
Speaker 0: basically the thing that John C Dvorak is actually kind of right and even though people think he's crazy is that He says there should be metering and not net, you know net neutral metering It's just yo you pay for how much bandwidth you use.

376
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,863
Speaker 0: The problem

377
00:24:52,923 --> 00:25:05,472
Speaker 1: is they can't sell metered bandwidth in the US because people are so used to seeing Unlimited with the tiny asterisk that if they see a per hour or per kilobit or whatever charge They're gonna freak out and think it's the days of AOL all over again, but

378
00:25:05,532 --> 00:25:08,020
Speaker 0: the price is reasonable then it's all good.

379
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,320
Speaker 0: You know, the thing is this everyone who you know argues against this is always like oh the price is gonna be crazy.

380
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:16,203
Speaker 1: The thing is the prices are unreasonable I know.

381
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:22,216
Speaker 0: but if the price is reasonable, I would be totally cool with you know Being metered as long as it meant I could.

382
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:24,800
Speaker 0: you know I could do as much as I want if I do more.

383
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:36,780
Speaker 1: The other issue is I get this impression that if like a cent per megabyte if all the ISPs decided to start Metering they wouldn't like lower their prices and then just meter accordingly to cover the cost.

384
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:41,540
Speaker 1: They would simply keep their current prices and charge more for anyone who goes above a certain amount.

385
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,886
Speaker 0: Yeah, see that's the thing is like.

386
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:52,365
Speaker 0: it's basically saying yes metering would be cool If you if the person doing the metering was not a dick, but the people who are running this Metering would be cool.

387
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:57,200
Speaker 1: If the person doing it, even if they are a dick was regulated in some way They don't have to be regulated.

388
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,156
Speaker 0: It doesn't mean not a dick charge people to a fair correct price, but of a fraction not a cent.

389
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:03,260
Speaker 1: That's impossible.

390
00:26:03,524 --> 00:26:06,825
Speaker 1: So we need to regulate it Because there's not impossible.

391
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:10,276
Speaker 1: it is because the way you still have to have a physical wire.

392
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:15,174
Speaker 0: go to everyone's house And yes You have a flat fee for the wire and that maintains that wire.

393
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:27,360
Speaker 1: because the people who maintain the wire Don't they want to have the monopoly people who pay their what they maintain the wire now Yes, the people who actually also sell you the bandwidth in many cases or they lease it from the local like telco.

394
00:26:28,162 --> 00:26:28,464
Speaker 0: It just.

395
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:32,860
Speaker 0: it needs to be a utility just like phone and electricity and water and then it'll be done.

396
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,544
Speaker 1: Yes, it does.

397
00:26:33,684 --> 00:26:37,163
Speaker 1: if it was treated like utility as opposed to this I mean it is.

398
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:37,484
Speaker 1: I mean

399
00:26:37,504 --> 00:26:41,540
Speaker 0: I think about every other utility though is metered electricity is metered water is better

400
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:57,957
Speaker 1: But at the same time there are a lot of laws like for example We get our electricity and our gas but by law Even though the what the pipes and wires that come to our house are owned by one company We have the right to buy our gas and electricity from anyone else out there within.

401
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:09,266
Speaker 1: there's certain limitation but we can buy it from other people and The people who own the wires to our house are forced by law to accommodate that and they are forced to charge us a certain Minimal regulated amount.

402
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,678
Speaker 1: and they can't charge us extra because they have a monopoly on the wire.

403
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,840
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I mean it's it's possible for people to do this without having the government tell them to but it's never been never happened.

404
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,545
Speaker 1: So we have to have been telling what to do.

405
00:27:20,565 --> 00:27:25,220
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I mean as much as I'm an advocate of deregulation and libertarianism.

406
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,407
Speaker 1: History has shown that deregulation ends in ruin.

407
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:29,209
Speaker 0: Yeah.

408
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:34,685
Speaker 0: Oh if we ever get some sort of ymax wireless meshy network We don't need these bastards anymore.

409
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:38,279
Speaker 0: Anyway, cuz unlike water and electricity we can push it over the sky.

410
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:45,990
Speaker 0: and Even is actually strongly considering, you know Allocating some spectrum to free Internet's even better.

411
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:54,840
Speaker 1: that allows all the crazy things to happen because then Nerds can make mesh networks that are entirely independent of any possible government control or interference.

412
00:27:55,181 --> 00:28:00,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's absolutely no way for the government to do any government in any part of the world to do anything about it.

413
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:08,154
Speaker 0: Which means two things well short of technological jamming and you know, all those Aurelian things You know, it would be it would be a war that the government would lose.

414
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:09,680
Speaker 0: any government would lose.

415
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,297
Speaker 1: Well, the government even the Chinese government could win by going one step further and cutting the tall trees.

416
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:18,225
Speaker 0: I Guess that's the only way that's the only way.

417
00:28:18,706 --> 00:28:20,551
Speaker 1: but but I that happened.

418
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:27,409
Speaker 0: you don't get a. you would a nerd awesomeness everywhere and be Child porn would be all over the place.

419
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:31,488
Speaker 1: Well, if you got if they had to cut the tall trees situation I think you'd run into the member.

420
00:28:31,528 --> 00:28:37,614
Speaker 1: that article we talked about a long time ago about how Engineers think like terrorists and or terrorists think like engineers.

421
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:41,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't want to piss Like engineers, it's well.

422
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:44,020
Speaker 1: now the good terrorists think like engineers.

423
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,212
Speaker 0: Again anyone every engineer right?

424
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:55,425
Speaker 0: I mean look at like this some of the stuff that like What's the Bruce Schneier rice?

425
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:58,255
Speaker 0: He's like the foremost security expert in the world, right?

426
00:28:58,495 --> 00:28:59,840
Speaker 0: He's like, oh, this is so easy.

427
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,107
Speaker 0: Look how you can get through the airport.

428
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:02,032
Speaker 0: Look how you can do this.

429
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:02,856
Speaker 0: Look how you can do that.

430
00:29:02,897 --> 00:29:03,500
Speaker 0: It's so simple.

431
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:09,760
Speaker 0: It's like if I wanted to make a knife on an airplane I would go and get some like iron epoxy at Home Depot and a piece of cardboard.

432
00:29:10,222 --> 00:29:12,915
Speaker 0: Bring it on the plane, you know, I fold the piece of cardboard.

433
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:14,020
Speaker 0: I put in the iron epoxy.

434
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,206
Speaker 0: I hold it there now.

435
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:16,734
Speaker 0: I have a sharp knife on the plane.

436
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:17,699
Speaker 0: Tada, right?

437
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,734
Speaker 0: Nope engineers think like this and they come up with these things all the time.

438
00:29:21,754 --> 00:29:23,160
Speaker 0: I come up with these things all the time.

439
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:35,858
Speaker 0: It's trivially easy to ruin the world if you have an engineering brain but anyone who is smart enough to think of these things and be an engineer is Not a terrorist because smart people aren't evil That's it.

440
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,221
Speaker 0: There's just.

441
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:36,422
Speaker 0: that's.

442
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:39,916
Speaker 0: the reason that the world is still in one piece is because no smart people are evil.

443
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:44,559
Speaker 0: if there was even one Engineer who was an ass and wanted to kill everyone we would all be dead.

444
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:59,874
Speaker 1: Anyway, before we talk too much more about that I'd like to read for you a a quote from an article that this is kind of my news bit and You're gonna feel a lot of righteous indignation, but

445
00:30:00,335 --> 00:30:01,640
Speaker 0: I'm not indignant or fat

446
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:03,646
Speaker 1: Maybe not you but the rest of you.

447
00:30:03,947 --> 00:30:08,240
Speaker 1: you're gonna feel some sort of bristle perhaps and I'm gonna read the whole thing.

448
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:09,868
Speaker 1: I'll let you mull over it for a second.

449
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:12,239
Speaker 1: Then we'll talk about what what actually was going on there.

450
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:15,583
Speaker 1: quote Mr.

451
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:23,695
Speaker 1: Starks, I'm sure you strongly believe in what you're doing But I cannot either support your efforts or allow them to happen in my classroom.

452
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:27,871
Speaker 1: at this point I am not sure what you are doing is legal.

453
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:33,108
Speaker 1: No software is free and Spreading that misconception is harmful.

454
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:41,680
Speaker 1: This is a world where Windows runs on virtually every computer and Putting on a carnival show for an operating system is not helping these children at all.

455
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:52,058
Speaker 1: I am sure if you contacted Microsoft They would be more than happy to supply you with copies of an older version of Windows and that way Your computers would actually be of service to those receiving them.

456
00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:59,560
Speaker 1: The story here was basically that you can read the articles.

457
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:09,237
Speaker 0: I don't really want to parrot like explain the whole situation and make sure that you read the article Written by the guy that he wrote sort of after it exploded so you can get the real story.

458
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:20,099
Speaker 0: basically Dude shown off open source teacher who I'm not just any dude He's a dude that like puts together like junky old computers He gives them the people who can't afford computers and he puts Linux on him.

459
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,500
Speaker 1: Yes, but uh teacher sees this going on has no understanding of technology.

460
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,472
Speaker 0: She sees like kids in a class with computers right looking at something.

461
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:32,100
Speaker 0: They're all gathered around obviously up to mischief, right?

462
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,010
Speaker 0: They got some CDs.

463
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:39,272
Speaker 0: they got from some guy Running on computers, you know and the teacher doesn't know anything.

464
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:41,560
Speaker 0: She's not technologically literate or anything.

465
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,028
Speaker 0: You know, she's a Windows world like 90% of people.

466
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:57,586
Speaker 1: and of course freaks out and leads to this guy writes an article article gets read by people who then paraphrase article full of righteous indignation gets crazier and crazier and crazier and Makes a little internet explosion.

467
00:31:57,987 --> 00:32:02,384
Speaker 1: and then there's a whole follow-up article where the guy who wrote the article was like, dude Yes, she was wrong.

468
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:03,307
Speaker 1: And yes, she was dumb.

469
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:07,460
Speaker 1: But seriously you people are overreacting times a million.

470
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, he like he found out that the school system actually even though they run Windows has like shit tons open-source.

471
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,752
Speaker 0: They got the open office and the Firefox and the whole, you know, it's just.

472
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:17,500
Speaker 0: there's one teacher who didn't know.

473
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:20,171
Speaker 0: She saw some kids in her class up to mischief.

474
00:32:20,412 --> 00:32:22,039
Speaker 0: She was not technologically literate.

475
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,945
Speaker 0: So she said some things and you know from her, you know Understanding or whatever.

476
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:30,416
Speaker 0: and then she learned a lesson that oh my god Linux open source.

477
00:32:30,456 --> 00:32:32,889
Speaker 1: I didn't know but The the point.

478
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:33,191
Speaker 1: I want him.

479
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:38,132
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about the article I don't want to talk about the oh my god, the internet overreacted.

480
00:32:38,153 --> 00:32:39,658
Speaker 1: Yeah.

481
00:32:40,320 --> 00:33:03,428
Speaker 1: Oh shit but this brings up a lot of really important issues that we have all as technologists run into and first off the fact that if you're in school and the authority figures that are Responsible for your education appear to know less about the things you know about than you You are not going to respect them.

482
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:25,830
Speaker 1: and one of them one of the biggest problems I've seen Among smart kids especially kids who were smart in technology in schools in public high schools in public middle schools Is that because of the curriculum and because you'll often have teachers who while they are very knowledgeable in their subjects or whatever At the same time they are completely Unknowledgeable in the things that the students are knowledgeable about?

483
00:33:26,513 --> 00:33:37,718
Speaker 1: it's very easy for teachers to lose all Respect and in fact gain the contempt of the best and brightest students in their classes Simply by the fact that on the surface they appear to be completely ignorant and illiterate.

484
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:38,180
Speaker 1: effectively.

485
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:42,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean back and that you've always had a problem of students disrespecting teachers.

486
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:43,264
Speaker 0: This is nothing new.

487
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:45,494
Speaker 0: and students thinking they're smarter than teachers.

488
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:46,780
Speaker 0: That is nothing new either, right?

489
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,908
Speaker 1: I'm sure you all think you're smarter than your teachers.

490
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:49,731
Speaker 1: Yes, I did too.

491
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:51,740
Speaker 1: The only difference between you and me and that I was right.

492
00:33:53,584 --> 00:34:01,180
Speaker 0: But Nowadays right you have this compounding problem of the kids basically live in a completely separate world.

493
00:34:01,502 --> 00:34:10,159
Speaker 0: Then the teachers do except for the very young teachers, you know It's like these are I mean like in the 50s even in like when I was in school, right me and my teachers.

494
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,226
Speaker 0: We lived in the same world.

495
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,454
Speaker 0: We had you know, it's like we understood.

496
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:16,320
Speaker 0: everything was sort of an even understanding.

497
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,540
Speaker 0: I might have known about more than them in computers, but it's like they knew more about George, Washington.

498
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:27,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, there weren't like this huge gap between the generations, right?

499
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,902
Speaker 0: but now there's always a generation gap, but now the generation gap is Ginormous.

500
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:34,366
Speaker 1: I mean look here's here's an example.

501
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,369
Speaker 1: when I was in high school.

502
00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:38,760
Speaker 1: I watched the Simpsons when it was on TV.

503
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:40,907
Speaker 1: I watched it as it came out on TV.

504
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,359
Speaker 1: All my friends watched it and all my teachers watched it.

505
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:48,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we there like we all knew there was a common shared culture.

506
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:54,319
Speaker 1: But now a kid in high school now, he he watches like a YouTube poop and that is what he is into.

507
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:57,076
Speaker 1: The teacher doesn't know it doesn't even know what that is.

508
00:34:58,123 --> 00:35:00,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, they wouldn't even understand it if you showed it to him.

509
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:03,454
Speaker 0: I mean like think about think about this right in the 50s.

510
00:35:03,474 --> 00:35:04,600
Speaker 0: You'd have a problem, right?

511
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,009
Speaker 0: The problem would be kids got a playboy in class, right?

512
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,800
Speaker 0: But the teacher understands Playboy magazine, right?

513
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:13,954
Speaker 0: Understand the student.

514
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:16,400
Speaker 0: the student understands Playboy magazine.

515
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:19,037
Speaker 0: They have a common understanding and they and they know shit.

516
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,320
Speaker 0: I better hide this shit from the teacher and shit you in trouble mister, right?

517
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,117
Speaker 0: There was this common understanding even if there was a lack of respect or a generation gap.

518
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:34,353
Speaker 0: nowadays There is actually that it's difficult to communicate because the gap has widened.

519
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:38,226
Speaker 0: something that has always been a problem is now a Tremendous problem.

520
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:47,943
Speaker 0: the teacher sees a student like, you know Doesn't understand that Wikipedia is actually kind of good kind of bad kind of not in between, you know I mean like.

521
00:35:47,983 --> 00:35:48,725
Speaker 0: how long was it?

522
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:54,381
Speaker 0: Like don't cite any websites in your paper because it's not it's like dude It's.

523
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:54,722
Speaker 0: it's.

524
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:56,831
Speaker 0: that's not how the world works anymore.

525
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, just cuz it's in a book versus a website.

526
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,089
Speaker 0: There's nothing inherent about the medium that says this is right.

527
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:02,771
Speaker 0: This is wrong.

528
00:36:02,832 --> 00:36:05,379
Speaker 0: All right, you know, it's just so huge.

529
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:08,320
Speaker 0: My problems like this will happen now.

530
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,573
Speaker 1: I don't think this is the fact that part of the gap is just the.

531
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:16,284
Speaker 1: the fact that the modern world requires Technological literacy.

532
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:37,091
Speaker 1: and yet be a lot of teachers and people who are in positions of authority over children Do not have technological literacy and while they can still get about their lives and while they are extremely Knows about fucking history never used a computer.

533
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:47,680
Speaker 1: He knows the Peloponnesian Wars He will go to great lengths of explaining about themistically is in democracy And I'll write you a hundred page book about it on his typewriter.

534
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,346
Speaker 1: But maybe you know, he's never.

535
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:51,655
Speaker 1: he doesn't use a computer and you see this a lot.

536
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:52,940
Speaker 1: There are teachers that don't use computers.

537
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,344
Speaker 1: They don't really understand them.

538
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:58,033
Speaker 1: There's that recent South Park or butters was a vampire where mr.

539
00:36:58,074 --> 00:37:01,885
Speaker 1: Garrison's at the front like now click on the Thing.

540
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:03,720
Speaker 0: Oh, that was the perfect illustration.

541
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:04,584
Speaker 0: What's going on?

542
00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:06,092
Speaker 0: Every single student's playing like.

543
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:10,628
Speaker 0: so I'm like it was one of those, you know FPS war games like the Call of Duty's or something like one of those.

544
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and mr.

545
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,459
Speaker 0: Garrison's like.

546
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:15,272
Speaker 0: No, I know.

547
00:37:16,462 --> 00:37:19,540
Speaker 1: But the student who I mean imagine it.

548
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:26,040
Speaker 1: It's the equivalent of in the 1900s where I'm in school and my teacher is illiterate and yet I know how to read.

549
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:32,580
Speaker 1: And that is the way someone who's technologically illiterate comes across to a young student in a school.

550
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,380
Speaker 1: They see a teacher who has trouble making PowerPoint go and they they look at that teacher as though that teacher is completely illiterate.

551
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:44,253
Speaker 0: Yep So I remember this actually reminds me of some time when I was at RIT.

552
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:46,020
Speaker 0: I was taking this computer security class.

553
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,040
Speaker 0: It was a pretty cool class, you know with this cool guy.

554
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,139
Speaker 0: I won't get into that now.

555
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,142
Speaker 0: But you know there was some time in the class is spent talking about open source and such right and there was a person in The class.

556
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:59,320
Speaker 0: it was an older woman, you know, she wasn't like a college student age.

557
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,258
Speaker 0: She was someone who went back to college which is totally cool.

558
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:04,420
Speaker 0: But you know, she didn't really understand the open source.

559
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:10,640
Speaker 0: She was like why why would you make something and then that was so great and then give it away for free?

560
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,845
Speaker 0: You could you could make money.

561
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:27,520
Speaker 0: I just don't get it Right and I bet at the time what I said was because we're not assholes, right but upon later thinking about it Here's here's the correct answer to this question right of why would you do open source and such, you know?

562
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,950
Speaker 0: Because people just don't understand it and that's one of the fundamental miss.

563
00:38:31,071 --> 00:38:32,335
Speaker 0: it's just misunderstanding.

564
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:33,237
Speaker 0: this lady had right.

565
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:34,020
Speaker 0: why?

566
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,645
Speaker 0: No, software is free.

567
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:37,433
Speaker 0: who would possibly create something for free.

568
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:38,980
Speaker 0: That's that doesn't make any sense, right?

569
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:43,280
Speaker 0: Here's the answer to that question and it ties into what we were just talking about the illiteracy, right?

570
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:48,259
Speaker 0: Okay, we talked about why would you do something if you weren't getting compensated for it?

571
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:58,626
Speaker 0: Well, if you actually saw like a hobbling old lady who is sick, you know, not a homeless lady But just a regular, you know who is you know, sick and crazy And you give her an Ubuntu CD.

572
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:02,080
Speaker 0: No, no, and she's actually having a problem, you know.

573
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,297
Speaker 0: Let's say an old lady like falls over in the street.

574
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:09,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, are you gonna require conversation to call 9-1-1 and you know help her out and such?

575
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:10,800
Speaker 0: No, you just do it, right?

576
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,437
Speaker 0: Well from a technological person looking at most of the world, right?

577
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,620
Speaker 0: Everyone is old ladies falling over in the street with heart attacks.

578
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,852
Speaker 0: That's how stupid the vast majority people are when it comes technology.

579
00:39:24,174 --> 00:39:28,040
Speaker 0: So open source is Calling 9-1-1 for the old ladies.

580
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:33,377
Speaker 0: We're doing it for free because you were fucking going to die because you understand this shit.

581
00:39:33,397 --> 00:39:35,880
Speaker 0: You're that stupid You're that screwed.

582
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:44,820
Speaker 0: So the read, you know It's like why could we charge you to call the ambulance and rescue you from your insane technological stupidity?

583
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,939
Speaker 0: I think that's what open source is.

584
00:39:47,020 --> 00:40:06,700
Speaker 1: But there's another factor there with open source the fact that I don't think a lot of people in previous generations other than of course people are hip to technology and Really have understood the fact that in the modern world many hobbies while they're hobbies And they're enjoyable to the people doing them produce valuable fruitful works.

585
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:14,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like in the olden days I mean there were a few hobbies that produced few fruitful works like ham radio sort of produced fruitful works.

586
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:18,220
Speaker 0: And I guess you know some people like photographers and that's produced.

587
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:20,790
Speaker 1: Some people think of hobbies like.

588
00:40:20,811 --> 00:40:30,728
Speaker 1: they think making a ship in the bottle and that doesn't help anyone Anyone except your mantle, but I guess nowadays like kids today our ship in a bottle is the YouTube poop Which I guess doesn't add anything to society either.

589
00:40:30,748 --> 00:40:30,788
Speaker 1: or.

590
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:45,496
Speaker 0: but some people ship in a bottle is like, you know me foes Which is a software program that allows you know Banks in all sorts of you know poverty stricken places to manage micro load

591
00:40:45,596 --> 00:40:49,876
Speaker 1: or say geek nights Which provides entertainment to at least dozens of people

592
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:50,298
Speaker 0: at least

593
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:50,519
Speaker 1: dozens

594
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:53,350
Speaker 0: Dozens of possible human beings.

595
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:55,260
Speaker 1: I always like how it's all politics.

596
00:40:55,421 --> 00:41:04,858
Speaker 1: I mean they're very widely listened to but they all whenever they talk about the listener They always refer to the listener, and I hope the listener enjoys the show.

597
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:07,444
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

598
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,212
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd steal that if it wasn't stealing.

599
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:13,426
Speaker 1: Yes like we got a letter from the listener today So they ever named the listener now.

600
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:14,610
Speaker 0: It's always the same one.

601
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:14,891
Speaker 0: Yes.

602
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:15,673
Speaker 0: Oh, that's great.

603
00:41:15,693 --> 00:41:16,376
Speaker 0: I like that.

604
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:17,540
Speaker 1: I like that show.

605
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:19,278
Speaker 0: Let's move on.

606
00:41:26,522 --> 00:41:28,515
Speaker 1: Anyway things of the day.

607
00:41:28,716 --> 00:41:29,260
Speaker 1: was that okay?

608
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,263
Speaker 1: Should I say it that way?

609
00:41:30,303 --> 00:41:34,619
Speaker 0: should I say it to consider ever you want because it's whatever all right check this out.

610
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:37,420
Speaker 0: MSI which is a motherboard maker mostly.

611
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,580
Speaker 0: But they are they're making netbooks now like most people are and they got this one called the MSI wind.

612
00:41:42,922 --> 00:41:44,876
Speaker 0: Pretty popular pretty popular the MSI wind.

613
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:45,118
Speaker 0: right.

614
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:51,487
Speaker 0: apparently the MSI wind is Almost exactly identical to a Mac.

615
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,580
Speaker 0: You know hardware wise you know it comes running XP or Linux or whatever.

616
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:59,020
Speaker 0: Right now it was missing something though.

617
00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:02,151
Speaker 0: They didn't have the driver for the wireless.

618
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:12,811
Speaker 0: so if you installed the OXX on it, right You know you just need a little hacked version of OS X and you're good to go, but You didn't need any hardware mods or any firmware updates or anything like that.

619
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:17,587
Speaker 0: all you needed was a hacked version of the OS X Software on a DVD and you're good to go.

620
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:21,840
Speaker 0: right the problem was that there was no driver for the wireless, right?

621
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:25,279
Speaker 0: So you wouldn't be able to do any wireless if you saw the OS X. otherwise it'd be just fine.

622
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:28,565
Speaker 0: There was a. there was a little leak.

623
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:34,579
Speaker 0: well will possibly almost guaranteed intentional leak with a wink wink from the MSI people.

624
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:38,335
Speaker 0: So now you can install OS X and the MSI wind.

625
00:42:38,697 --> 00:42:40,143
Speaker 0: oh snap And that's that's.

626
00:42:40,364 --> 00:42:41,287
Speaker 0: that's my thing of the day.

627
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:45,220
Speaker 0: cuz that's just so awesome that there was one of those wink wink leaks.

628
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:49,223
Speaker 0: Yeah, intentionally releasing the Wi-Fi The drivers.

629
00:42:49,243 --> 00:42:57,068
Speaker 0: you know I can install OS X on a non Mac because the thing is having OS X for like a TV PC plus.

630
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,720
Speaker 0: you're not gonna be paying for this copy OS X. you're gonna get a hacked one.

631
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:06,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like right now we have we have the oldest slowest like the very first Mac mini like the first one.

632
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,887
Speaker 0: Oh, we have the very first Intel one.

633
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:11,356
Speaker 1: I'm going to consider that the very first Mac.

634
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:19,552
Speaker 1: There was a g4 one Yes, but that does not count right, but anyway It's old and slow, but for being a TV PC.

635
00:43:19,692 --> 00:43:20,594
Speaker 1: It's fantastic.

636
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:21,517
Speaker 0: That's okay.

637
00:43:21,938 --> 00:43:30,888
Speaker 0: It's not perfect No, it's not, but while we lose a few things like easy emulation It'd be better if you had an HD TV would be better but that is that's true for any plugged into the.

638
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:39,380
Speaker 1: I could perhaps foresee buying one of these motherboards and taking the OS X we have hacking it and Putting it on the second TV in the house.

639
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,915
Speaker 0: Oh, you would need the newer OS X the one that we don't have.

640
00:43:42,157 --> 00:43:45,379
Speaker 0: ah crap Yeah, because you have the tiger we would need the leopard which is one newer.

641
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would actually consider, you know, if we had a new house and whatever, you know first we need to get newer TV.

642
00:43:52,721 --> 00:43:55,072
Speaker 1: God, yes, but I'll be I'm done with CRT.

643
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,900
Speaker 0: CRT's belong in basements Yeah, but they belong in the trash.

644
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:12,988
Speaker 0: But anyway after we're after we're done with that I could foresee eventually buying like, you know If they ever come out with a newer Mac mini we just get like the newer better one that way like, you know Wouldn't have trouble like Decoding videos sometimes

645
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:18,369
Speaker 1: because the the benefits of having like Linux or building it ourselves are somewhat mitigated by the fact that

646
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:20,216
Speaker 0: you get that little remote control

647
00:44:20,236 --> 00:44:23,003
Speaker 1: and the fact that the 99%

648
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:25,051
Speaker 0: of the time all you want to do is watch a video.

649
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:28,208
Speaker 0: and even though we can't run an emulator on it very easily Who cares?

650
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,139
Speaker 1: plus this the guys?

651
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,056
Speaker 1: The fact that that thing is a tiny silent box.

652
00:44:33,096 --> 00:44:33,800
Speaker 0: Yeah a lot.

653
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,520
Speaker 0: It's like I could go and build the most amazing like, you know Home theater PC HD PC, but it would be loud.

654
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:47,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, even if you like you water cool like you went the craziness it still have that little And it's big.

655
00:44:48,422 --> 00:45:00,059
Speaker 0: So the smallness and the quietness and the limited functionality of the Mac Mini is worth it because it still achieves 99% of the functionality we want even though it's not a hundred percent.

656
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:04,758
Speaker 0: and It you know that quietness and smallness outweighs the lack of functionality.

657
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:09,820
Speaker 1: So so I'm going to teach you all a word and I hope that you will start using.

658
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,794
Speaker 0: I think we've discussed this on geek nights before we may have.

659
00:45:12,814 --> 00:45:15,727
Speaker 1: it might have been a long time ago And there's definitely a wicked long time.

660
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:16,711
Speaker 0: It was pretty interesting.

661
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:20,780
Speaker 1: But just so you all are aware I'd forgotten about this word.

662
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:28,492
Speaker 1: But today I was setting up some Apache stuff at work and I had a reference because I don't have all the Apache Directives and things memorized.

663
00:45:28,774 --> 00:45:29,258
Speaker 0: No one does.

664
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:32,166
Speaker 1: I was Maybe one person does.

665
00:45:32,186 --> 00:45:34,013
Speaker 1: no, there's something.

666
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:35,960
Speaker 1: there's got to be some guy whose whole life is a patch.

667
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,865
Speaker 1: He's like the Rain Man.

668
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,780
Speaker 0: No, even though even like the Apache Foundation people don't fucking know.

669
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:42,353
Speaker 1: No, not those people, but there's got to be an Apache Rain Man.

670
00:45:42,675 --> 00:45:42,997
Speaker 0: I don't know.

671
00:45:43,258 --> 00:45:52,019
Speaker 1: anyway long story short One way to refer to the hash sign or the pound sign is the Octo Thorpe.

672
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,926
Speaker 0: Yep See I knew there was a word.

673
00:45:54,026 --> 00:45:57,701
Speaker 0: Octo Thorpe and rim said it and I go I've heard that word and then it say he's Like.

674
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:58,585
Speaker 0: oh, it's the pound sign.

675
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:03,156
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh I knew that it's like, you know hate it when you know something But you can't recall it at the moment.

676
00:46:03,196 --> 00:46:03,459
Speaker 0: It's like.

677
00:46:04,284 --> 00:46:07,579
Speaker 0: You knew it, but you couldn't come up with a pointer in the leaves.

678
00:46:07,881 --> 00:46:08,282
Speaker 1: You know it.

679
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:12,115
Speaker 1: the pointer in the relational database that is your brain is pointing that like it's.

680
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:15,586
Speaker 1: there's a pointer pointing at it But you can't find that pointer.

681
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:21,182
Speaker 1: you find all these other pointers that get close, but there's like a link missing and You know.

682
00:46:21,222 --> 00:46:27,024
Speaker 1: that happens when you're trying to remember something and like you're thinking like, you know, you know it but you don't know What's the word.

683
00:46:27,044 --> 00:46:32,905
Speaker 0: and then as soon as you're reminded suddenly you're like, oh I did know that but there's no way to prove You're like you could be lying.

684
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:33,708
Speaker 0: Dr.

685
00:46:33,848 --> 00:46:35,132
Speaker 1: Pachto Octo Thorpe.

686
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:44,935
Speaker 1: like it comes suddenly when you get to the right pointer, but yeah This is an article talking about the etymology of the word Octo Thorpe and all the different theories of where it really came from.

687
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:48,044
Speaker 1: if you're a tech or You listen to geek nights.

688
00:46:48,064 --> 00:46:51,899
Speaker 1: They're the kind of person who would like to have an affected way of saying Octo Thorpe.

689
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:55,780
Speaker 1: To give a little quote just you you know, see where this article is going.

690
00:46:56,844 --> 00:47:08,209
Speaker 1: He says that it was a joke term originally Octo Thorpe Invented by two friends John C Shaq and Hubert T Outhlaut Who deliberately included the th sound.

691
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:17,000
Speaker 1: knowing that it would be difficult for speakers of certain languages to say No, they then went on to quietly introduce it into various documents until it was too late to retract it.

692
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:18,923
Speaker 0: Let's see about that.

693
00:47:19,224 --> 00:47:23,616
Speaker 1: Yeah, the articles fun and hopefully we'll get some affectations going here.

694
00:47:23,937 --> 00:47:32,197
Speaker 0: affectations are good All right, so today we decided we were having a hard time coming to the tech topic But I thought it might be interesting to talk about.

695
00:47:32,297 --> 00:47:37,380
Speaker 0: you know The the ebooks the e-paper ebook readers that sort of thing, right?

696
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:44,853
Speaker 1: Especially because today I carried a very heavy and large book to work and then home from work And I didn't even have my bag.

697
00:47:44,873 --> 00:47:50,413
Speaker 1: and let me tell you I'm getting real sick of carrying gigantic books around and then spilling things on.

698
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:56,680
Speaker 0: I think my strategy right now is I'm not gonna buy any more Non comic books that are on dead tree, right?

699
00:47:57,221 --> 00:48:17,660
Speaker 0: And then when I finish all the ones I've got that are on dead tree Then I will go and buy the Kindle 2 or whatever it is and then go for that because you know what my one of the Major things I've been had about the Kindle that I don't like is that the selection is not as strong as it is with the dead Tree, right, you know you can get any book on dead tree, but you can't get any book on Kindle.

700
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,243
Speaker 0: But you know what.

701
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,900
Speaker 0: you can get enough books on Kindle more than you're gonna read in your whole life.

702
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,950
Speaker 0: So does it really matter?

703
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,040
Speaker 0: does it really?

704
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,065
Speaker 0: So I think that's my plan.

705
00:48:26,145 --> 00:48:28,033
Speaker 0: But even though that's my plan.

706
00:48:28,053 --> 00:48:35,316
Speaker 0: It's not everyone's plan and I think people, you know, they have a hard time, you know sort of understanding.

707
00:48:35,396 --> 00:48:39,389
Speaker 0: what sort of holding Ebooks back what's holding e-paper back?

708
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,735
Speaker 0: Why is the Kindle the way it is?

709
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:41,880
Speaker 0: Why isn't it there yet?

710
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,589
Speaker 0: You know, why is all this other technology like crazy?

711
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:47,620
Speaker 0: Why can we do a 3d game, but we can't do a freaking ebook?

712
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:48,651
Speaker 0: It should be the simplest thing.

713
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:49,499
Speaker 0: It's just text, right?

714
00:48:50,603 --> 00:48:53,542
Speaker 1: Well, the short answer is displays Batteries.

715
00:48:53,803 --> 00:48:56,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, the RN let let's talk about the displays, right?

716
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:03,680
Speaker 0: Unlike, you know your LCD screen on your computer an e-book reader has, you know different needs, right?

717
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,133
Speaker 0: I mean, it's only displaying text hopefully and only.

718
00:49:07,193 --> 00:49:10,932
Speaker 0: you know, we'd like to get more colors But right now we can't even get black and white.

719
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:12,180
Speaker 0: So let's just stick with that for now.

720
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean in the long run what like?

721
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:23,120
Speaker 1: I'm reading this book on advanced skiing techniques And it consists half of text and half of pictures of guys doing the ski techniques and showing how to do them.

722
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that really wouldn't work out on the Kindle.

723
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:26,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, no Kindle for that.

724
00:49:26,981 --> 00:49:29,469
Speaker 0: But you know for most books like a sci-fi novel.

725
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:29,870
Speaker 0: it's not.

726
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:34,607
Speaker 0: it's just text right and even if there's a few illustrations They're mostly black and white.

727
00:49:34,647 --> 00:49:35,250
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's a pain.

728
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,878
Speaker 0: It's a you know, mass-market trade paperback.

729
00:49:36,918 --> 00:49:39,810
Speaker 0: You're all good Right and you could do those right?

730
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:45,972
Speaker 0: So you it's not anyway, but In the long run new on color right now black and white.

731
00:49:46,494 --> 00:49:48,160
Speaker 0: why can't we make a black and white screen?

732
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:48,521
Speaker 0: That's good.

733
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:49,123
Speaker 0: Number one.

734
00:49:49,465 --> 00:49:52,115
Speaker 0: We need to make a screen that doesn't hurt.

735
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:55,679
Speaker 0: when you look at it for a long time You look at a book for a long time.

736
00:49:56,101 --> 00:49:59,276
Speaker 0: If you look at an even a good LCD look at it for a long time.

737
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:05,274
Speaker 0: It's bright It's shining light at you and it you get some eye strains, you know, it's.

738
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:07,320
Speaker 1: it's tricky business because you want to.

739
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:22,420
Speaker 1: One philosophy is to emulate as much as possible what actual printed paper looks like because you have been reading that for a long time and I think that's the best way to Go right now because it'll if we perfect that we'll get to an acceptable point.

740
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:32,745
Speaker 1: but at the same time We really need to go beyond that because the printed paper while it's great for a lot of things at the same time It does have its limitations Can't read in the dark.

741
00:50:33,127 --> 00:50:36,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was just gonna say all right, you can't read printed paper in the dark.

742
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:42,860
Speaker 0: Well, okay, so we don't need the light behind the screen anymore because you can't read the Kindle in the dark either.

743
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,500
Speaker 0: We'll make it sort of like the original GBA screen where the light came from outside and bounced off.

744
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,236
Speaker 1: But now do you want to have a book light on your Kindle?

745
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,713
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean seriously a book light on the Kindle.

746
00:50:52,773 --> 00:50:53,640
Speaker 0: Is that really necessary?

747
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,715
Speaker 0: You could have a switch that turns on a light behind the screen.

748
00:50:57,017 --> 00:50:59,548
Speaker 0: that could work But even then that drains the batteries.

749
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:00,211
Speaker 0: no light.

750
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:02,139
Speaker 1: be also light behind the screen.

751
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:07,797
Speaker 1: Lightning the light The background behind the text is going to increase the eye string.

752
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:09,640
Speaker 1: cuz now again You've got this direct.

753
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:12,035
Speaker 0: Well, it can be like the ever see those Timex watches.

754
00:51:12,096 --> 00:51:12,760
Speaker 0: you push the button.

755
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,068
Speaker 0: It sort of has this greenish light.

756
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:20,220
Speaker 1: that doesn't you know, it's pretty cool You do something like that, but at the same time that color might be really fatiguing in the long run.

757
00:51:20,341 --> 00:51:20,782
Speaker 0: It could be.

758
00:51:21,003 --> 00:51:23,755
Speaker 0: it really you gotta really you got to figure these things out that I.

759
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:31,080
Speaker 1: this is a part where we need to Do a lot of like just research of you know testing humans and looking at their physiological reactions to reading things.

760
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:35,913
Speaker 0: So LCD screens right as we have them for our computers and TVs and whatnot.

761
00:51:36,214 --> 00:51:38,600
Speaker 0: and plasmas also use too much electricity.

762
00:51:38,964 --> 00:51:42,428
Speaker 0: they're too bright and You know, they're actually too thick.

763
00:51:42,488 --> 00:51:43,392
Speaker 0: I mean an e-book.

764
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:44,738
Speaker 0: readers got to be small or else.

765
00:51:44,778 --> 00:51:45,220
Speaker 0: What's the point?

766
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,880
Speaker 0: I might as well carry the freaking book, you know, it's got to be small and light and last a long time.

767
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,033
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I'm just gonna take the book with me.

768
00:51:52,053 --> 00:51:53,260
Speaker 0: There's no point right plus.

769
00:51:53,421 --> 00:51:54,528
Speaker 0: I also got to be cheap.

770
00:51:55,132 --> 00:51:56,139
Speaker 1: and I mean look at the display.

771
00:51:56,862 --> 00:52:01,300
Speaker 1: Part of the problem with LCDs and the technology we have is that they constantly have to be refreshed.

772
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:08,480
Speaker 1: There's a refresh rate and unless your refresh rate is super high, even if you can't physically see it It causes eye strain eventually.

773
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:14,380
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean look your computer monitor most likely is completely redrawing itself as in blank.

774
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:21,080
Speaker 0: Draw everything again like 75 times a second, you know, it's it's constantly redrawing itself, right?

775
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,413
Speaker 0: And that's you know, that's not when you talk about like FPS in games.

776
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,980
Speaker 0: You think about vertical sync, right?

777
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:30,854
Speaker 0: So it's like if you have a you're playing counter-strike and your monitor is 75 Hertz.

778
00:52:31,034 --> 00:52:33,000
Speaker 0: it redraws itself 75 times a second.

779
00:52:33,662 --> 00:52:36,349
Speaker 0: What's the point of having counter-strike do 100 FPS?

780
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:37,894
Speaker 0: You're only seeing 75 of them.

781
00:52:38,315 --> 00:52:46,460
Speaker 0: So vertical sync says hey counter-strike Yeah, just make 75 FPS and I'll see all the 75 and it'll be locked in, you know, and it'll be totally cool.

782
00:52:46,781 --> 00:52:47,684
Speaker 0: That's a vertical sync.

783
00:52:47,784 --> 00:53:03,590
Speaker 0: is now if I'm reading a book if you refresh the screen at all Even if it's really fast, right number one that's using electricity to you know redraw and I'm usually looking at one Unmoving thing for a long time a page.

784
00:53:03,992 --> 00:53:06,140
Speaker 0: It's not like a game where it's moving all over the place.

785
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,463
Speaker 1: It's actually a page of text very specifically because this is you know It's.

786
00:53:09,564 --> 00:53:10,840
Speaker 1: not only is it one unmoving thing?

787
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:17,431
Speaker 1: But the biggest deal-breaker in the world for me and I feel like this Even if people haven't thought of it is the biggest deal-breaker for anyone.

788
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:21,264
Speaker 1: there can't be any scrolling No, right or up down.

789
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:28,382
Speaker 1: scrolling as opposed to page flipping is perhaps because even if people like especially people who are used to Reading books.

790
00:53:28,724 --> 00:53:32,619
Speaker 1: I feel like they're like I can read long documents on my monitor because I'm kind of used to it.

791
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,463
Speaker 1: But if you're not used to that Have it.

792
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:39,900
Speaker 1: scrolling and having text move and your eyes following it is gonna tire you out so quick.

793
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of the things just flip pages, you know, they don't really.

794
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:50,880
Speaker 1: I've never seen an e-book reader with scrolling But I see people having to zoom in and scroll just because or zoom in and then flip pages more often.

795
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:55,520
Speaker 1: But that's just the side effect that a lot of people's eyes are really bad and they can't read the smaller fonts.

796
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,745
Speaker 0: Yeah, handling fonts.

797
00:53:56,785 --> 00:53:57,950
Speaker 0: That's a software issue though.

798
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,055
Speaker 0: That's not the hardware issue.

799
00:53:59,115 --> 00:54:00,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it is an issue.

800
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:06,496
Speaker 1: Yep And but the display has to be high enough resolution to support a reasonable amount of text on page.

801
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:07,800
Speaker 1: also big enough size to where?

802
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,722
Speaker 1: I can turn the pages at a reasonable pace without scrolling or without having to turn the page constantly That's true.

803
00:54:13,742 --> 00:54:18,518
Speaker 0: If you have insufficient resolution, you know, you're gonna have to either move the text around or something.

804
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:24,860
Speaker 1: It's also insufficient resolution means less capability for anti aliasing and all those things that make you look good.

805
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:27,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, better looking fonts makes it a lot easier to read.

806
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,085
Speaker 0: I mean you ever look at like.

807
00:54:29,105 --> 00:54:35,914
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not gonna lie here right you look at a computer running OS X. Right, all the fonts look really great and all like.

808
00:54:35,934 --> 00:54:37,200
Speaker 0: the windows are really smooth.

809
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:40,373
Speaker 0: It's not anything the Mac does in the hardware.

810
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:41,820
Speaker 0: It's just got the same Nvidia chips.

811
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,743
Speaker 0: Everything else has.

812
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:44,548
Speaker 0: it's not anything special at the monitor.

813
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,494
Speaker 0: They're just LCD monitors, right?

814
00:54:46,975 --> 00:54:49,422
Speaker 0: It's the rendering algorithms They use.

815
00:54:49,823 --> 00:54:50,044
Speaker 0: right.

816
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:55,740
Speaker 0: everything you see in OS X is actually based on postscript or PDF or something similar to that.

817
00:54:55,841 --> 00:55:02,620
Speaker 0: you know the rendering system and Steve Jobs is always super anal about font rendering and all that shit and that's why everything's super smooth.

818
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:15,075
Speaker 0: If you VNC to a Mac and on your PC everything in the Mac window will be super smooth All right, so and it makes you know, there's no lie It makes things a lot easier to read and it's a lot more comfortable.

819
00:55:15,135 --> 00:55:18,368
Speaker 0: and it does make you know Good typography makes a significant difference.

820
00:55:18,669 --> 00:55:27,135
Speaker 0: So you need a high resolution screen to get that on the e-book You know to to really make it a much more enjoyable thing and not have you go.

821
00:55:27,196 --> 00:55:27,657
Speaker 0: I fuck this.

822
00:55:27,677 --> 00:55:35,100
Speaker 0: I'm reading a paper book All right, so we got a. you know, you got to have a screen that when you push the button right now.

823
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,520
Speaker 0: I just said we don't want the refresh rate, right?

824
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:41,797
Speaker 0: We want the screen to not refresh right when you're just looking at one page.

825
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:49,320
Speaker 0: that way it doesn't use any battery when you're looking at one page not doing anything and You're not gonna hurt your eyes because the screens redrawing itself.

826
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:54,080
Speaker 0: But when I push the button to go to next page the next page has to be there instantly.

827
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:56,589
Speaker 0: So it's like you need a really quick redrawing.

828
00:55:56,669 --> 00:55:59,760
Speaker 0: Otherwise the page would be like I'm turning the page.

829
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:04,960
Speaker 0: Okay, you know you need to have it like click new page immediately.

830
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:09,736
Speaker 0: So it's gonna have a quick refresh but has to not do it unless you push the button.

831
00:56:10,217 --> 00:56:11,060
Speaker 0: That's very very tricky.

832
00:56:11,283 --> 00:56:12,560
Speaker 0: We can't seem to manage that now.

833
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:19,918
Speaker 1: Of course in terms of just other hardware and this is tied into the display because a lot of display technology either uses a lot of power or sucks.

834
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,545
Speaker 1: Batteries also still suck.

835
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:28,020
Speaker 1: Yes things gotta last an entire transatlantic flight without me having to swap batteries.

836
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:34,905
Speaker 0: Exactly, I mean even swap or recharge or anything like that, you know, I mean Basically, I don't want to.

837
00:56:34,985 --> 00:56:38,380
Speaker 0: you know, if they want this is like there's a power outage, right?

838
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:44,635
Speaker 0: I can read a book with like a candle or some shit, right but My Kindle runs out of batteries in the power outage.

839
00:56:45,097 --> 00:56:45,640
Speaker 0: It's not good.

840
00:56:47,763 --> 00:57:02,877
Speaker 0: Now I'm bookless so The battery's got to last a long time and as you know people, you know There's always advances in battery technology getting more electricity per battery and less less weight in the battery and and all this stuff less expensive.

841
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:06,593
Speaker 0: but People seem to forget and you know rim points aside all the time.

842
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:09,260
Speaker 1: to is one of my favorite things to point out But I'll let you do it this time.

843
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, is that a battery?

844
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,433
Speaker 0: is energy in a brick basically?

845
00:57:13,453 --> 00:57:15,520
Speaker 0: or energy in a tube or something like that?

846
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,980
Speaker 1: It's a controlled hand grenade.

847
00:57:17,181 --> 00:57:22,460
Speaker 0: Yes, if you want a battery that lasts longer laws of physics get in your way.

848
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,262
Speaker 0: You have to.

849
00:57:23,282 --> 00:57:27,533
Speaker 0: you have to put more energy in a smaller space.

850
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:31,561
Speaker 0: if you want it to be lighter and last longer and Etc.

851
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:33,827
Speaker 0: You're gonna need to be more energy and less space.

852
00:57:34,168 --> 00:57:37,277
Speaker 0: more energy and less space means explode II right?

853
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:38,520
Speaker 0: There's no way around this.

854
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:39,519
Speaker 0: It's the laws of physics.

855
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:47,685
Speaker 0: There's no way you can put a whole shit ton of energy in a very small space then, you know and not have it be dangerous It's gonna have.

856
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:51,960
Speaker 0: it's no way around that and in a lot of ways that is holding us back.

857
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:56,505
Speaker 0: There are in existence Batteries that are really freaking great.

858
00:57:56,826 --> 00:57:58,810
Speaker 0: They're just fucking really dangerous.

859
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:00,595
Speaker 0: And that's why you don't have them in your laptop.

860
00:58:00,615 --> 00:58:04,191
Speaker 1: I Don't I'd be willing to accept.

861
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:08,412
Speaker 1: actually personally I'm willing to accept the danger and even the way.

862
00:58:08,472 --> 00:58:12,329
Speaker 0: the danger isn't even like you Gonna hurt yourself with the mean.

863
00:58:12,349 --> 00:58:16,866
Speaker 0: we're already having problems like cell phone setting on fire Turns it into a bomb.

864
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:20,500
Speaker 0: right that there's no danger to just if you use it normally and appropriately.

865
00:58:20,982 --> 00:58:28,460
Speaker 0: The danger is only if you're stupid or if you buy a poorly made Chinese junk battery and it sets on fire at the gas station.

866
00:58:28,962 --> 00:58:30,165
Speaker 0: There's no danger in.

867
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:39,895
Speaker 0: you know, a well-made battery being used normally at all No, but you know, even if you put a lot of energy in there I guess too much energy could be a problem, but we could work that out.

868
00:58:39,935 --> 00:58:40,900
Speaker 0: That's a solvable problem.

869
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:54,580
Speaker 1: even more I'm getting the point where size matters to me more than weight and I would actually be willing to accept a Very much more heavy small laptop or a very much more heavy Kindle If the battery just lasted twice as long.

870
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,610
Speaker 1: like add a couple pounds to it, but make it dense.

871
00:58:57,091 --> 00:58:58,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, just if it's.

872
00:58:58,255 --> 00:58:58,536
Speaker 0: if it's.

873
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,399
Speaker 0: you know, it doesn't.

874
00:58:59,419 --> 00:59:01,767
Speaker 0: I mean I already I put two batteries in my laptop.

875
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:02,550
Speaker 0: that ain't significant.

876
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,080
Speaker 0: That's pretty much all the weight.

877
00:59:04,402 --> 00:59:07,878
Speaker 0: if I take both batteries out It weighs almost nothing like like.

878
00:59:08,019 --> 00:59:10,850
Speaker 0: it weighs like maybe the weight of two pieces of paper.

879
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:11,575
Speaker 0: It's that light.

880
00:59:11,836 --> 00:59:13,185
Speaker 0: the batteries are all the weight.

881
00:59:13,648 --> 00:59:21,030
Speaker 0: So Really if I'm putting two batteries if I'm putting two batteries in it, I'll put two heavier batteries in it.

882
00:59:21,352 --> 00:59:25,376
Speaker 0: It's still the same size You know, it's not any bigger.

883
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:31,896
Speaker 0: It's just more battery life and like an extra pound or two, whatever It's not gonna hurt my shoulder.

884
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:33,143
Speaker 0: It's already light enough.

885
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:34,128
Speaker 0: big big deal.

886
00:59:34,148 --> 00:59:34,610
Speaker 0: Go for it.

887
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:39,766
Speaker 0: No, actually, I guess like 10 pounds would bother me or five but not one.

888
00:59:39,927 --> 00:59:40,870
Speaker 1: but it would be like Dragon Ball.

889
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:42,395
Speaker 1: It trains you it makes you strong.

890
00:59:42,897 --> 00:59:44,402
Speaker 0: Oh, yes my shoulder great.

891
00:59:44,502 --> 00:59:46,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll have one big beefy shoulder.

892
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,629
Speaker 0: Yeah But I was a big beefy lap.

893
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:57,754
Speaker 1: I guess the third point like in terms of DRM honestly that is not as much of a concern to me as you'd think because a Lot of the things I want to read.

894
00:59:57,835 --> 01:00:07,341
Speaker 1: one of the reasons I want a device like this is that more and more there are long textual things Online that are free that I want to read at my leisure.

895
01:00:07,421 --> 01:00:11,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, like project Gutenberg, but I don't want to read them On my monitor.

896
01:00:11,856 --> 01:00:18,950
Speaker 0: Yeah project Gutenberg has like all these files I want to read but to read them on my monitor is painful, especially when they're too long.

897
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:19,594
Speaker 0: I mean or plus.

898
01:00:19,634 --> 01:00:20,621
Speaker 1: I want to read them on the trains.

899
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:22,030
Speaker 1: All right, I copy them to my laptop.

900
01:00:22,171 --> 01:00:24,320
Speaker 1: I got all these text files on my laptop.

901
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:31,470
Speaker 0: I got to remember my spot, you know Even if I have a program that's made to help me read project Gutenberg files, you know.

902
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:34,264
Speaker 0: And I turned down the brightness on the monitor and I'll adjust all that.

903
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:35,570
Speaker 0: It's still not good enough.

904
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,990
Speaker 0: I still have to scroll, you know, it's just it's not gonna work out.

905
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:48,172
Speaker 1: But honestly, I'm willing to think it's too much money and I'm willing to pay what I pay for a paperback book for a DRM DB book.

906
01:00:48,293 --> 01:00:49,635
Speaker 0: see that's just the thing right?

907
01:00:49,715 --> 01:01:00,930
Speaker 0: It's weird because it's like I'm not willing to pay for Music, even though the digital music is cheap and DRM free but somehow I'm willing to pay for the digital book.

908
01:01:01,452 --> 01:01:01,974
Speaker 1: You know why.

909
01:01:01,994 --> 01:01:06,130
Speaker 1: what a reason I think is that with music they still haven't done what I want them to do.

910
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,715
Speaker 1: Which is the you want?

911
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:12,050
Speaker 1: every song the Beatles ever did organized hundred bucks fifty bucks.

912
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,306
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I think that's really what it is.

913
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:19,502
Speaker 0: Is that Everything I buy in some way, you know, that's that's like media.

914
01:01:19,722 --> 01:01:21,206
Speaker 0: right is a lot.

915
01:01:21,266 --> 01:01:26,321
Speaker 0: for a little I buy a DVD Box set 30 bucks all of cowboy bebop, right?

916
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:29,230
Speaker 0: I don't buy like some single DVD junk anymore, right?

917
01:01:30,052 --> 01:01:32,721
Speaker 0: Very rarely, I guess once in a blue moon, right?

918
01:01:32,741 --> 01:01:37,898
Speaker 0: I don't buy no, you know, like Comic book for four dollars.

919
01:01:38,019 --> 01:01:40,170
Speaker 0: I buy like, you know the omnibus.

920
01:01:40,391 --> 01:01:47,270
Speaker 0: It's like 20 bucks for like 30 comics, you know, and that's that's the way to get money for stuff these days.

921
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,597
Speaker 0: So music they're not selling.

922
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:58,542
Speaker 0: every song Beatles have ever done with the correct id3 tags in high quality For 20 bucks, they're selling one song for a dollar.

923
01:01:58,702 --> 01:02:00,829
Speaker 1: It's not even just that even if it's DRM free.

924
01:02:00,869 --> 01:02:01,310
Speaker 0: fuck that.

925
01:02:01,632 --> 01:02:04,185
Speaker 1: It's not even just the deal the Scott Johnson syndrome.

926
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:09,125
Speaker 1: for me It's very simply the metadata is worth more to me than the data.

927
01:02:09,446 --> 01:02:10,550
Speaker 1: I can get the data for free.

928
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:13,204
Speaker 1: I can pirate anything I want from anywhere at any time.

929
01:02:13,486 --> 01:02:14,290
Speaker 1: That's not the concern.

930
01:02:14,512 --> 01:02:16,429
Speaker 1: It's trivial for me to get any music I want.

931
01:02:17,312 --> 01:02:20,990
Speaker 1: What I want is the metadata and I'm willing to pay a lot for the metadata.

932
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:21,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, why?

933
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:28,490
Speaker 0: if the music is organized and is high quality and I don't have to sit there sorting it that's worth money.

934
01:02:28,631 --> 01:02:37,266
Speaker 0: I have so many unsorted mp3s and actually the fact that they are so disorganized is Preventing me from listening to a lot of download torrents.

935
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:46,022
Speaker 1: like a while ago I downloaded a torrent of every rom Stein song ever including like Thousands of bootleg recordings from live concerts.

936
01:02:46,122 --> 01:02:52,610
Speaker 1: Yep, and you know what it is Practically useless to me in the form that I have it because it's so unorganized.

937
01:02:52,731 --> 01:03:02,210
Speaker 1: You can't figure out what to listen to what's what or even if it is organized It's always organized differently and in to make it conform to the way I already organized my music is impossible.

938
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:09,762
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like this guy organizes his stuff by genre artist album and this guy Organizes by just artist album no genre.

939
01:03:09,782 --> 01:03:18,090
Speaker 0: and this guy does like, you know Just albums and this guy does like, you know by year and then by album.

940
01:03:18,612 --> 01:03:22,242
Speaker 1: This way even though I don't like iTunes very much.

941
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:29,040
Speaker 1: Like I really don't like it just in general if Whoever offers what I want first will get my money.

942
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:31,770
Speaker 1: if Apple was like, hey, we're doing this now.

943
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:36,928
Speaker 1: You want every rock mononoff piano concerto ever performed by like these five people.

944
01:03:36,968 --> 01:03:37,470
Speaker 1: hundred bucks.

945
01:03:38,274 --> 01:03:41,110
Speaker 1: I will probably give more money to Apple than you could possibly.

946
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:53,341
Speaker 0: I mean if someone actually did this I would pretty much sit for like an hour making a list of all the artists That I wanted and then go buy the complete collection of every single artist Even if it was like two thousand dollars or something like that.

947
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:54,124
Speaker 0: and I'd be like.

948
01:03:54,165 --> 01:03:55,109
Speaker 0: and then I delete every mp3.

949
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,615
Speaker 0: I had just boop gone.

950
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:07,948
Speaker 1: Well, well, I would keep as long as I wear this I can Simultaneously, oh my god, I got to start distributing that mp3.

951
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:13,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know any any any mp3 that was you know a record label whatever, you know.

952
01:04:13,974 --> 01:04:15,142
Speaker 0: But yeah with books, right?

953
01:04:15,202 --> 01:04:16,410
Speaker 0: I'm buying books now.

954
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:19,290
Speaker 0: So as far as I'm concerned right now books are a good deal.

955
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:25,630
Speaker 0: You got a whole shit ton of pages a big freaking book full of words, right and they're relatively cheap.

956
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:29,224
Speaker 0: It's like five maybe bucks for a book on Amazon, right?

957
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:30,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you get a whole book.

958
01:04:31,131 --> 01:04:34,905
Speaker 0: It's like hours and hours and hours of reading and it's high quality.

959
01:04:34,965 --> 01:04:40,653
Speaker 0: right on the Kindle The books are like one dollar and it's just as much reading Plus.

960
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:55,110
Speaker 1: I actually really look forward to the kind of the rise of digital publishing of books because There is a barrier to entry to the mass market to small-time authors because getting a wide publication deal is very expensive.

961
01:04:55,673 --> 01:05:00,718
Speaker 1: publishing online with a DRM thing Cost you nothing.

962
01:05:00,738 --> 01:05:02,625
Speaker 0: Yeah me think about how many people.

963
01:05:02,685 --> 01:05:04,090
Speaker 0: you have written novels, right?

964
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:06,130
Speaker 0: And then no publisher would say yes to them.

965
01:05:07,034 --> 01:05:16,250
Speaker 0: Most likely their book is crap, right, but even though their book is crap It might be the one that you like, you know, it's like there are only ten people in the world who would enjoy this book.

966
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:17,057
Speaker 0: We're not publishing it.

967
01:05:17,077 --> 01:05:18,490
Speaker 0: Well, what if you're one of those ten people?

968
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:25,664
Speaker 0: Well, if that guy puts that book out as an e-book and you got an e-reader hot damn You're gonna get that book and it's gonna be awesome.

969
01:05:25,824 --> 01:05:26,789
Speaker 1: when we get to the point where?

970
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:37,249
Speaker 1: Someone publishes their book and then the technic or dutifully buys exactly one copy Yeah, yeah, I just this whole time I've been thinking about Martin Solanas and his books.

971
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:42,705
Speaker 0: But yeah, think about you know, something like audible also right which has the DRM.

972
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:44,250
Speaker 0: Why don't I do audible?

973
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,533
Speaker 0: Well, number one, I don't.

974
01:05:45,634 --> 01:05:48,242
Speaker 0: I don't enjoy the audiobooks as much as the paper books.

975
01:05:48,383 --> 01:05:50,550
Speaker 1: I don't very specific circumstance.

976
01:05:50,635 --> 01:06:00,143
Speaker 1: Yes they gotta get the right person reading it and it has to be a book that does not benefit from the Phrasing and like the literary the word part on the page.

977
01:06:00,163 --> 01:06:01,870
Speaker 1: Yep as opposed to the idea part.

978
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,196
Speaker 0: That also also.

979
01:06:03,296 --> 01:06:04,120
Speaker 0: I think that you know.

980
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:11,530
Speaker 0: reading on the page is a more Significant intellectual activity that works the brain in a far better and different way than listening.

981
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:15,690
Speaker 1: Well, my primary use for audiobooks are when I'm driving.

982
01:06:16,032 --> 01:06:19,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I just use podcasts for that and I don't need an audiobook.

983
01:06:19,111 --> 01:06:20,849
Speaker 0: But even if I didn't need an audiobook, right?

984
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,859
Speaker 0: I'd say I had no podcast and I want it.

985
01:06:22,939 --> 01:06:25,050
Speaker 0: I was had a drive a commute, you know.

986
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,249
Speaker 0: That would be a good reason to get an audiobook.

987
01:06:27,953 --> 01:06:31,770
Speaker 0: Why don't I do audible even without the DRM excuse of not doing audible?

988
01:06:32,776 --> 01:06:34,714
Speaker 0: there is so expensive.

989
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:40,522
Speaker 0: it's like $15 for a book on audible For like five bucks.

990
01:06:40,562 --> 01:06:41,249
Speaker 0: I can just get the book.

991
01:06:42,034 --> 01:06:44,930
Speaker 0: I can get three books to the price of one audio, but you're not paying for the book.

992
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:48,129
Speaker 1: You're paying for like James Earl Jones to read it to you.

993
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:52,001
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I you know, it's as far as I'm concerned though.

994
01:06:52,683 --> 01:06:54,770
Speaker 0: It's the same, you know, it's the same thing.

995
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:57,358
Speaker 0: You're not gonna do read the book and listen to the audiobook.

996
01:06:57,799 --> 01:06:59,444
Speaker 0: So why it's like?

997
01:07:00,046 --> 01:07:01,090
Speaker 0: why would I do that?

998
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:05,622
Speaker 0: There's no reason to Unless James Earl Jones came to my house and read it.

999
01:07:05,763 --> 01:07:06,668
Speaker 0: That would that would be okay.

1000
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:08,388
Speaker 1: I think Cook me a little dinner.

1001
01:07:10,552 --> 01:07:12,923
Speaker 1: I don't know if someone comes over to my house and reads to me.

1002
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:14,409
Speaker 1: I kind of want them to cook for me, too.

1003
01:07:14,971 --> 01:07:15,753
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

1004
01:07:16,355 --> 01:07:16,996
Speaker 0: I'll read to you.

1005
01:07:17,016 --> 01:07:17,799
Speaker 0: Will you cook for me?

1006
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,984
Speaker 1: But I mean there are things.

1007
01:07:20,004 --> 01:07:27,070
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk about the Kindle itself, but There are a lot of little things that I want that aren't necessarily deal-breakers like for one.

1008
01:07:27,774 --> 01:07:28,740
Speaker 1: I want the ability to.

1009
01:07:29,364 --> 01:07:42,320
Speaker 1: I want it to be a touchscreen so I can take a little stylus or something is built into it and Highlight a bunch of text and hit a button and it saves that text with an MLA and APA Citation and then we'll send it over the internet to my computer.

1010
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,126
Speaker 1: That'd be pretty cool uploaded somewhere.

1011
01:07:44,146 --> 01:07:44,868
Speaker 0: That's a real good one.

1012
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:45,853
Speaker 0: I like that.

1013
01:07:46,255 --> 01:07:48,848
Speaker 1: that that is something I've wanted for most of my life.

1014
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:54,368
Speaker 0: man If you did that the researchers would be like and students would be all over that You could just put all the textbooks on there.

1015
01:07:54,811 --> 01:08:01,950
Speaker 1: The ripoff college textbook, I remember what like the biggest paper I ever wrote at RIT was this long like treatise on political communication.

1016
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:03,877
Speaker 1: There was like 15 pages.

1017
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:06,710
Speaker 0: You should have written a paper about citations with many citations in it.

1018
01:08:07,395 --> 01:08:08,970
Speaker 1: The paper was 15 pages long.

1019
01:08:09,612 --> 01:08:15,390
Speaker 1: It took me two hours to properly format and double-check all my citations.

1020
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,301
Speaker 1: I could have written like a five page paper in that time.

1021
01:08:18,322 --> 01:08:18,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know right?

1022
01:08:18,984 --> 01:08:21,435
Speaker 1: I Want the Kindle to be able to do that.

1023
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:29,109
Speaker 1: plus I realize how much more often I would quote things And they're people set up like delicious like things or they would share quotations.

1024
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:31,879
Speaker 0: Why don't we make a Firefox plug-in that does citations?

1025
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:32,461
Speaker 1: Let's do that.

1026
01:08:32,501 --> 01:08:33,505
Speaker 1: That's really easy to make.

1027
01:08:33,765 --> 01:08:35,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really easy.

1028
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,093
Speaker 1: No, not just that though.

1029
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:40,227
Speaker 1: You need to have a server where you can share citations and tag them.

1030
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:42,957
Speaker 0: Oh Oh wait, I found something.

1031
01:08:42,977 --> 01:08:44,001
Speaker 0: tations and quotes though.

1032
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,390
Speaker 0: Itro is easy to use Firefox extension.

1033
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,819
Speaker 0: How do you collect manage and cite your research sources?

1034
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,490
Speaker 0: It lives right where you do your work in the web browser itself.

1035
01:08:51,671 --> 01:08:52,273
Speaker 1: I will check it out.

1036
01:08:52,332 --> 01:08:54,863
Speaker 1: However, the Kindle needs to do that or I'm not that interested.

1037
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:55,484
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1038
01:08:55,886 --> 01:08:56,689
Speaker 0: Oh something exists.

1039
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:57,635
Speaker 0: Someone beat us to it.

1040
01:08:57,895 --> 01:08:58,620
Speaker 0: I wonder if it's good.

1041
01:08:58,841 --> 01:09:00,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm kind of dubious.

1042
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:02,962
Speaker 1: I feel like we could do it better whatever it is, but I don't know.

1043
01:09:03,002 --> 01:09:03,506
Speaker 1: I'll check it out.

1044
01:09:03,546 --> 01:09:04,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's got screencast.

1045
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,995
Speaker 0: We'll be all right.

1046
01:09:05,236 --> 01:09:07,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also looking free and cool anyway.

1047
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:09,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

1048
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:18,741
Speaker 0: also, you know like the user interface on these thing I mean the Kindle's got it right with the directly downloading wherever you are as long as this Wi-Fi going on Apple Taking take note.

1049
01:09:19,106 --> 01:09:26,126
Speaker 0: Yeah Podcasts downloading a little weak actually Sony, you know Sony's ebook reader supposedly has a better screen.

1050
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,529
Speaker 0: the Kindle and I think that is true.

1051
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,402
Speaker 0: But also Sony's got a new like Walkman that actually does the podcast.

1052
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:34,810
Speaker 0: downloading properly doesn't have much else going for it.

1053
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:35,968
Speaker 0: It needs to be a phone.

1054
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:38,035
Speaker 0: But you know, they.

1055
01:09:38,055 --> 01:09:40,684
Speaker 0: finally there is a device at the proper podcast support.

1056
01:09:41,066 --> 01:09:43,537
Speaker 0: Hooray Took long enough.

1057
01:09:43,818 --> 01:09:45,307
Speaker 1: I mean beyond that there's a lot of little things.

1058
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:48,279
Speaker 1: That would be cool Like some you know, Netflix has the.

1059
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:51,170
Speaker 1: you rate things you read and you can recommend things to other people.

1060
01:09:51,912 --> 01:09:54,182
Speaker 1: I'd like a built-in network for that like the Kindle could.

1061
01:09:54,202 --> 01:09:55,970
Speaker 0: probably Amazon reviews are on there.

1062
01:09:56,362 --> 01:10:06,830
Speaker 1: Yeah but I use the Kindle and I feel like it could be done in a better way to encourage people to Review books quickly and recommend books to their friends and you could subscribe to the right.

1063
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:20,367
Speaker 0: Amazon reviews is not as slick as Netflix with their reviewing and recommending and sharing and suggesting plus that Amazon mostly Amazon suggestion engine is more because remember Netflix doesn't care about which ones you pick.

1064
01:10:20,407 --> 01:10:21,330
Speaker 0: they get your money anyway.

1065
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:25,425
Speaker 0: Right, so they want you to help find things that you'll like that way.

1066
01:10:25,445 --> 01:10:26,368
Speaker 0: You'll stay subscribed.

1067
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:29,216
Speaker 0: Amazon Right wants you to buy shit.

1068
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:30,540
Speaker 0: So there's subscription.

1069
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:40,350
Speaker 0: their recommender is trying to find things that you are likely to buy Not things that your friends like or things like that, you know, because that's not gonna make you buy more.

1070
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:45,784
Speaker 0: well, it might but you know Have we exhausted this topic possibly?

1071
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:53,570
Speaker 1: All right My plan is I'm probably gonna wait and wait until the Kindle 2 is out and I can hold one.

1072
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,868
Speaker 0: I hope they make sort of like a Kindle mini as in.

1073
01:10:55,888 --> 01:11:01,671
Speaker 0: you know I pod many because I've always been more a fan of the mini nano type things than like the big ones, you know Like.

1074
01:11:02,436 --> 01:11:05,053
Speaker 0: so if there was like I got a 4-inch screen like no like.

1075
01:11:05,093 --> 01:11:12,669
Speaker 0: I want it to be the size right like the screen should be the size of a You know mass-market trade paperback, you know the runs they have.

1076
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:18,210
Speaker 0: now The page is almost as big as like the page in a normal hardcover book, you know, it's kind of big.

1077
01:11:18,672 --> 01:11:21,945
Speaker 0: I'd rather have a smaller one, you know, that's like, you know, you know this size.

1078
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:30,022
Speaker 0: No one can see this Like, you know the size of like a piece of paper from the Hyperion book, you know That size is how big I want it to be that way.

1079
01:11:30,063 --> 01:11:31,168
Speaker 0: I can just sort of toss it in.

1080
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:34,590
Speaker 0: You know, I mean the Kindle is pretty small, but you can go smaller people.

1081
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:38,327
Speaker 1: Of course, it has to be as indestructible as a Nintendo product.

1082
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:39,713
Speaker 0: Oh, of course I mean like books.

1083
01:11:39,853 --> 01:11:44,209
Speaker 0: riggin beat the shit out of them all over the place and they they just keep keep on trucking.

1084
01:11:44,735 --> 01:11:46,733
Speaker 0: Oh, that's another thing though Right is I?

1085
01:11:47,115 --> 01:11:51,310
Speaker 1: the one thing with the DRM that does bother me can't just give books to other people when you're done with.

1086
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,495
Speaker 1: It's no secondary market.

1087
01:11:52,555 --> 01:11:54,382
Speaker 0: You can't lend right?

1088
01:11:54,402 --> 01:11:55,828
Speaker 0: I mean right now I buy a book.

1089
01:11:56,169 --> 01:12:00,121
Speaker 0: everyone I know can read that book but with the DRM not so much.

1090
01:12:00,201 --> 01:12:03,110
Speaker 0: so there needs to be something to do with that, right?

1091
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,929
Speaker 0: You know, I should be able to pass a book around.

1092
01:12:05,431 --> 01:12:07,197
Speaker 1: Well, that's the problem with DRM.

1093
01:12:07,237 --> 01:12:25,441
Speaker 1: is that companies realize that as there's so much media out there the second hand sale problem is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with because I Don't buy new books that often anymore because I'll go to like the strand which has every book I want to read ever for like four bucks

1094
01:12:25,562 --> 01:12:27,190
Speaker 0: or more books than you can read ever.

1095
01:12:27,993 --> 01:12:39,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, but any book I want that was written other than books that just came out today I can buy for like nothing at a used bookstore pretty handily yep, and video games books music.

1096
01:12:39,338 --> 01:12:47,087
Speaker 1: everyone's having this problem and they're using the technological solution of digital distribution with DRM thus effectively.

1097
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:53,989
Speaker 1: in the end We're going to no longer have the right of first sale for any of our media And I don't know how I feel about that and I don't know what to do about it.

1098
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:56,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that's really they're putting.

1099
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:02,110
Speaker 0: what they are doing is they're putting in danger Right the the continued existence of culture.

1100
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:02,973
Speaker 0: I mean like is.

1101
01:13:03,013 --> 01:13:07,810
Speaker 0: a big problem is when you're researching old ancient shit, is that there are stone tablets?

1102
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:14,701
Speaker 0: They didn't really make it, you know, and their papyrus really fucking didn't make it, you know We don't had the papyrus and now we don't know about them.

1103
01:13:14,761 --> 01:13:15,425
Speaker 0: right there needs.

1104
01:13:15,445 --> 01:13:20,810
Speaker 0: well in the future Maybe our books will make it because we sort of put them in a safe place, you know.

1105
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:22,077
Speaker 0: Can we know how to preserve them?

1106
01:13:22,137 --> 01:13:24,489
Speaker 0: and maybe some other things will make it?

1107
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:29,530
Speaker 0: DRM stuff ain't gonna make it to tomorrow if fucking someone turns the DRM server off.

1108
01:13:29,991 --> 01:13:31,255
Speaker 0: So you're basically you put.

1109
01:13:31,356 --> 01:13:37,096
Speaker 0: if you put some you know some song out into the world and the only form it's in is This DRM form.

1110
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,634
Speaker 0: that song might not be here It's gonna be lost.

1111
01:13:40,956 --> 01:13:55,525
Speaker 1: make a requirement anything that will be distributed with digital rights management must be submitted to say the Library of Congress and Kept there in Such and then it will be released to the public the moment the copyright expires

1112
01:13:55,886 --> 01:13:56,930
Speaker 0: in a non DRM way

1113
01:13:57,031 --> 01:14:00,136
Speaker 1: Yes an archive there Otherwise forever and then

1114
01:14:00,196 --> 01:14:08,610
Speaker 0: the Library of Congress should just put every single piece of material It has that is not copyrighted just online for free for everyone in the US.

1115
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:09,573
Speaker 1: Of course you realize.

1116
01:14:09,593 --> 01:14:22,336
Speaker 1: what that will do is bring to full fruition the issue that I've been talking about for a long time that someday is going to destroy our current idea of the media market and the Competition of the past with the present.

1117
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:26,470
Speaker 0: Yep, if we actually that's the real I'm beginning to think that's the real reason.

1118
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:29,650
Speaker 0: They're extending copyright because it's not you know.

1119
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:35,005
Speaker 0: Oh, no Elvis will enter public domain and then we won't be able to make money off Elvis anymore.

1120
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,550
Speaker 0: It's oh shit.

1121
01:14:37,154 --> 01:14:39,329
Speaker 0: All the books from the 50s are now free.

1122
01:14:39,931 --> 01:14:45,268
Speaker 0: No one will have any reason to buy a new book because they can just read all the books from the 50s.

1123
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:49,070
Speaker 0: and now there Are enough books available and enough music available for free.

1124
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,236
Speaker 0: No one cares about new stuff anymore.

1125
01:14:51,297 --> 01:14:53,965
Speaker 0: And then the 60s stuff will be free.

1126
01:14:54,346 --> 01:14:54,847
Speaker 0: who cares?

1127
01:14:54,888 --> 01:14:55,670
Speaker 0: They don't care that.

1128
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:57,590
Speaker 0: They mean they're making a lot of money on Beatles music.

1129
01:14:57,690 --> 01:15:03,650
Speaker 0: But but it's a care more about the fact that oh shit now everyone just listens to Beatles music for free.

1130
01:15:03,972 --> 01:15:04,495
Speaker 0: I remember.

1131
01:15:04,515 --> 01:15:06,930
Speaker 0: no one cares about the new music it becomes.

1132
01:15:08,012 --> 01:15:11,064
Speaker 1: It gets bigger and bigger because more media is created.

1133
01:15:11,084 --> 01:15:12,710
Speaker 1: It keeps getting worse there.
