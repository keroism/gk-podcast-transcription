1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,052
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, June 13th, 2018.

2
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:12,574
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:14,740
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:17,640
Speaker 1: Uma, Musume a pretty derby.

5
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,657
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:32,259
Speaker 1: So as many of you know, we complain a lot about the city of Boston here on geek nights Because I've been playing about any city that's not in New York.

7
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:38,180
Speaker 0: Yeah But when we complain about most or as big or bigger than New York when we complain about most we don't go to those places.

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,304
Speaker 0: We complain that they're.

9
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,152
Speaker 1: they're not as big as New York.

10
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't get a bagel at like 5 a.m That's correct.

11
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:47,275
Speaker 0: But if I went even Tokyo, which is probably bigger than New York, I'd complain.

12
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:48,460
Speaker 0: the train stopped running at night.

13
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:52,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the train stopped running almost the train to be on time the rest of the day.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,685
Speaker 0: So I guess it evens out.

15
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:56,417
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it'd be just as crowded as the four.

16
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:59,199
Speaker 0: five More crowding depending on when you go.

17
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:03,776
Speaker 1: The seven is getting to the point where I need someone to help push everybody into the car.

18
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,951
Speaker 1: Come on, basically Yeah, I also got the bicycle.

19
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:08,340
Speaker 0: it's a good news today though it rain.

20
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:14,240
Speaker 0: I couldn't use it cuz I had to end my day at a different office And I didn't want to ride from one of us to the other on a bicycle.

21
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:21,545
Speaker 1: No, cuz I have to set up my shit if I want to park the bike at that other office every building like Independent of my company.

22
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:26,840
Speaker 1: the buildings have their own management companies and those are the people that actually have to follow that New York City law.

23
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,500
Speaker 1: So every building I have to comply with like that building's bike policy.

24
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:34,171
Speaker 1: So I can like register the bike and do all this bullshit.

25
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:36,059
Speaker 1: so I only did that for one building.

26
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:47,874
Speaker 1: but Boston we complain about for different reasons the specific things we complain about with Boston That are within the city of Boston's control because the third thing is that it's always too cold there.

27
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:49,519
Speaker 1: Is that one?

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,338
Speaker 1: But the city of Boston has in my personal opinion the worst drivers of any city on earth.

29
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:08,269
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Boston's to this day the only city I've ever been in where I've seen a person in a car drive Backwards up a one-way street the wrong way.

30
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,673
Speaker 1: more than once.

31
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:14,580
Speaker 1: I think I've seen that happen At the majority of patches I've been to in Boston.

32
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,270
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, it's it's right in Boston you have the problem of.

33
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,700
Speaker 0: the roads were designed in ancient colonial times.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,455
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like the very bottom of Manhattan with the colonial roads.

35
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:30,640
Speaker 0: before you go farther north There's the grid made in smarter, but you also have this weird social contract for people in Boston.

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,039
Speaker 0: Just don't respect the idea of following basic rules except that it's the whole city and not just one part.

37
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,491
Speaker 1: Yeah But even that like people I've.

38
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:40,180
Speaker 1: no I don't understand nowhere else on earth.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,335
Speaker 1: Just do people just suddenly start driving backwards long distances.

40
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:45,720
Speaker 1: Like where does that happen?

41
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:57,660
Speaker 1: I didn't even have to do that in fucking Istanbul confirmation, but uh Let's say let's keep an eye out for the next time we see that happen and I suspect we'll see it happen in Boston.

42
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:05,335
Speaker 1: But number two is Boston Forces all the conventions there the nerd conventions to have ridiculous fake security.

43
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:10,839
Speaker 1: and it's gone to the point like it's kind of why we stopped going to animate Boston because it's too much of a hassle to deal with.

44
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:16,820
Speaker 1: and If I had to stop going to a PAX PAX East in Boston is the one I would drop first.

45
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:26,140
Speaker 1: I would rather go to San Antonio than the one in Boston and there's an article about this because The city of Boston itself is having problems with the security.

46
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:30,211
Speaker 1: so the city both forces events to have this completely fake security.

47
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:38,380
Speaker 1: that causes huge problems, especially for nerd conventions and The security they have mandated is breaking their own rules.

48
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:43,320
Speaker 1: So there's this article in this like Universal Hub, which is like a local Boston thing.

49
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:45,621
Speaker 1: I think it's like Boston's Gothamist Like.

50
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:50,319
Speaker 1: I don't really know the deal with it, but I see people in Boston retweeted a lot and no one else talks about it.

51
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,007
Speaker 1: But it actually has an article about this situation.

52
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:58,984
Speaker 1: and basically during PAX East there were some doors that were locked that Can't bet.

53
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:03,240
Speaker 1: according to some rules in Boston cannot be locked when there are people in the convention center.

54
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:11,820
Speaker 1: But they were locked because people kept trying to walk in those doors Instead of going through the metal detectors that were only in like two or three places.

55
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:43,140
Speaker 1: now they shouldn't have any metal detectors and all those doors should be open, but Basically the city of Boston is now fighting with the city of Boston and it's a fight between like whoever makes that bullshit security happen and the BPD licensing detectives because apparently there's all these licensing rules around buildings having doors open or closed and They got involved because a bunch of cops noticed that at PAX East There was a huge crowd of people trying to get out a door that was not only locked but duct-taped shut

56
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:52,930
Speaker 0: Like how our country is so fucked up and yet we're spending courts and judges and lawyers time because someone didn't open a goddamn door Even though they definitely should have opened that door.

57
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,700
Speaker 1: But yep, that door should be open.

58
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,062
Speaker 1: That's the.

59
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:55,886
Speaker 1: that's the important part.

60
00:04:55,906 --> 00:04:58,320
Speaker 0: The point is look how small potatoes this is.

61
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,660
Speaker 0: This is such a small potato that like a baby you would make one french fry for the baby and they still be hungry.

62
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how small that potato is.

63
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:15,819
Speaker 1: so I Guess I hope the city of Boston loses and the metal detectors disappeared some point Even though I know that's gonna be the result.

64
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:21,413
Speaker 1: What I really hope for is that packs will someday just leave Boston and then I'll never have to go there for a nerd convention again.

65
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:23,927
Speaker 1: That's that's what I actually want.

66
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:37,955
Speaker 0: thing that is unrelated to nerdery almost entirely but you know, it only happens every four years, but people in the US at least might not be aware because The United States did not qualify for the World Cup which begins tomorrow.

67
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:44,780
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the World Cup Football people don't even know because we didn't qualify in this country and we don't care in this country.

68
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:46,959
Speaker 0: But it's kind of a big deal.

69
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,270
Speaker 1: So anyway in the actual anime and animation news.

70
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:53,120
Speaker 1: very briefly just because not everyone seems to be aware of it.

71
00:05:53,541 --> 00:06:03,160
Speaker 1: There is an anime con where we will probably go to it because it's in New York and we can literally take this Doing this in the news because I'm not announcing that we're doing anything at it.

72
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,420
Speaker 1: I'm saying that if you want an anime con That's probably the packs of anime cons based on the first one that happened.

73
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:15,740
Speaker 1: The second one is happening and it does not overlap with packs unplugged so you can actually go to it.

74
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:20,380
Speaker 1: It's November 16 17 18th in the Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

75
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:32,040
Speaker 0: So if you live near enough to New York City worth going otherwise, probably not Yep, but still probably worth going if you're close enough, but something interesting I noticed because there are cons that are bad where you shouldn't go even if they're right next door.

76
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:35,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the one trouble with having a nerd con in New York City.

77
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:45,298
Speaker 1: Like as much as I want packs to leave Boston I do not want them to get a New York City because a con in New York City is fucking awful Unless the only attendees are people who live in New York City.

78
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,300
Speaker 1: Like there aren't gonna be hotel blocks for people in New York that are affordable or anywhere near the convention.

79
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:53,440
Speaker 0: Yeah this time of year.

80
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,669
Speaker 0: Yeah hotels are not the cheapest.

81
00:06:54,729 --> 00:07:04,125
Speaker 0: if you want to have a convention in New York City The best time is February where hotel prices can go down from usuals of 500 to like 150 a night in places like downtown And such.

82
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:11,063
Speaker 0: but no one wants to come here in fucking February Because it's fucking cold and snowy and you'll get caught in a blizzard and your flight will get delayed and you won't get home on Time.

83
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:17,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why it's 150 a night As long as you're not staying in the touristy area where it's always 500 a night for a place with cockroaches.

84
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:20,287
Speaker 1: Yep, so it's happening.

85
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:21,149
Speaker 1: We'll probably be there.

86
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:28,950
Speaker 1: But the thing I noticed is that the panels cuz I always there's some panels and I haven't submitted anime panels anywhere in a while.

87
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,237
Speaker 1: Like I had to think about what anime panel or even do.

88
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:36,740
Speaker 1: but The panel slots are an hour long and there's no gaps.

89
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:41,440
Speaker 1: So the actual panel slots are actually 45 minutes long like by default.

90
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:46,280
Speaker 1: So all the panels at this con are actually like really short format.

91
00:07:46,982 --> 00:07:48,186
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a lot of panels.

92
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:57,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, which changes up my own methodology not like a short convention It's just when you make the panel slots 45 minutes with 15 minute breaks instead of one hour of 15 minute breaks.

93
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,329
Speaker 0: First of all, the schedule looks real nice.

94
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:04,311
Speaker 0: Yeah, but second of all You can cram in a lot of panels one per hour.

95
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,380
Speaker 1: I wonder like I don't know why they did this.

96
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,859
Speaker 1: I didn't even know this was the thing until like three days ago.

97
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:25,460
Speaker 1: but the 45 minute panel slot is interesting because Anime cons in particular though gaming cons largely have this problem now - most of the panels are Some industry person or panel is going to talk for five minutes and go straight to Q&A and then give away some swag.

98
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:31,424
Speaker 1: So you really lose nothing by making the panel slots shorter Like nothing is lost.

99
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,073
Speaker 1: by having them shorter the same amount of content will be provided.

100
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:42,360
Speaker 1: but for us it's interesting because Like everything we've ever done at a con we'd use the entire hours.

101
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:43,465
Speaker 1: I'd actually have to think of it.

102
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:46,358
Speaker 1: We might change the kinds of topics we talk about.

103
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:46,720
Speaker 1: We'll see.

104
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:55,098
Speaker 1: But anyways anime cons happening and in some other news being puppycat is getting its second season as mine is I Just said some other news.

105
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:57,647
Speaker 0: So the thing is right.

106
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:00,600
Speaker 0: is the the cartoon hangover with our Frederator?

107
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:12,299
Speaker 0: I'm not even sure what the difference is They seem to be one in the same as far as I can tell But they you know They make a lot of cool cartoons that we like like a Bravest Warriors and the being puppycat and a bunch of other stuff No one knows.

108
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:30,553
Speaker 0: At first they would post these things on YouTube and then I saw some of them because I kick-started and they would email me links To watch them on other sites and then eventually like they were posting like their YouTube channel Which I'm still subscribed to it wouldn't actually be posting full episodes And they'd be like links to some other site where you can watch them.

109
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:32,380
Speaker 0: and it was like it was very confusing.

110
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:43,957
Speaker 0: There was no easy and straightforward way to just watch all the new episodes of the shows We like as they come out in full and because of that I sort of fell off their bus because they made it too hard to stay on that bus.

111
00:09:44,439 --> 00:10:00,974
Speaker 0: So Another thing that really hurt them was that they didn't put out content consistently, which is understandable because they were making Animated TV, you know quality episodes as good as like, you know and an episode of Adventure Time yet They were just some little indie place that didn't have a TV network or anything.

112
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,200
Speaker 0: It was going straight to YouTube.

113
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,988
Speaker 1: Now if they were just on YouTube, that's fine.

114
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:14,425
Speaker 0: Like I'm already used to these sort of ad hoc schedules So it's understandable that they would not be putting out content super regularly, but they were putting it out Super irregularly.

115
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:17,019
Speaker 0: like when was the last Be In Public At episode over a year ago?

116
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,823
Speaker 1: Something like that.

117
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:20,580
Speaker 0: and people like paid money in Kickstarter for these things.

118
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,065
Speaker 0: It's like alright But now they've it's.

119
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:27,119
Speaker 0: this seems to be at least as set in stone as they can possibly be.

120
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:30,409
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a full season of Be In Public At.

121
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:31,552
Speaker 0: episodes that are made.

122
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:32,636
Speaker 0: they're coming.

123
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,040
Speaker 1: the episodes are going to here.

124
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,768
Speaker 1: There's important differences like changes.

125
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:40,406
Speaker 1: The episodes are gonna be half-hour full-length episodes now Yeah, but they're going to.

126
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:44,420
Speaker 0: it's still like the same creative team behind the story and stuff like that.

127
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, Natasha is actually there's a showrunner.

128
00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:49,619
Speaker 1: Natasha Leggery is actually favorite crazy person.

129
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:55,780
Speaker 1: We came to a shared understanding that we like a lot of the same things.

130
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:59,139
Speaker 1: Anything I like weird internet shit.

131
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:01,164
Speaker 0: well I can see the actual.

132
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:12,196
Speaker 0: you've got another think coming work and the animation of the show is going to be done by OLM which is Pokemon the studio that makes animates Pokemon.

133
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:12,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks like it.

134
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:20,957
Speaker 0: So, I mean if they can animate all those episodes of Pokemon reliably I'm sure they can animate episodes of Be In Public At reliably if they get paid which I assume they're gonna be paid.

135
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:23,487
Speaker 0: So Yep, so I wonder how much it costs.

136
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:27,000
Speaker 0: like how much do we have to save to make them animate what we want?

137
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:28,420
Speaker 1: I don't know.

138
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,360
Speaker 0: But what's interesting is so the crazy like how much would it cost to get them to animate one 30-minute episode of you guys?

139
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:33,841
Speaker 0: The anime.

140
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:39,180
Speaker 1: but apparently the creative team is actually gonna be living in Tokyo to work on the production of this season together with them.

141
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:40,060
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

142
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:48,072
Speaker 1: The only pretty only bad news here is I'm gonna read two sentences from the article that Can be waiting a long time between now and episode one.

143
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:50,140
Speaker 0: They should have just kept their mouth shut until they had her already.

144
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:51,185
Speaker 1: No, I could live with that.

145
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:52,773
Speaker 1: I think there's a trailer or something.

146
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:53,557
Speaker 1: But here's the problem.

147
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:53,980
Speaker 0: There is.

148
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:59,167
Speaker 1: The series will be available Through crunchyroll sounds good.

149
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:02,700
Speaker 1: parent company elations verve streaming platform.

150
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:04,566
Speaker 0: Okay, so gonna be in.

151
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,151
Speaker 1: it's not gonna be on crunchyroll.

152
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:07,235
Speaker 0: It's in the same place.

153
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,680
Speaker 0: It's hard to watch as all their other stuff.

154
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,564
Speaker 0: It's gonna be the place.

155
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:12,760
Speaker 0: I don't seem like two episodes of bravest warriors and haven't seen the rest.

156
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,560
Speaker 0: Yep, because I think I left off where the horse went of the dimension or something and that I think I saw it all.

157
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:21,529
Speaker 0: There was more stuff after that.

158
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:25,387
Speaker 0: that I'm pretty sure I haven't seen because it's on some weird website Probably this one you just mentioned.

159
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:25,487
Speaker 0: Yeah.

160
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:28,581
Speaker 1: I mean the ways I watch shows today are crunchyroll Netflix Like.

161
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,431
Speaker 1: I just have those subscriptions Amazon Prime.

162
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:31,195
Speaker 1: I just have that.

163
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:32,060
Speaker 1: that's how I like.

164
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,338
Speaker 1: I watch a lot of anime on Amazon cuz it's just there.

165
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,048
Speaker 1: Shows like venture brothers like the other kinds animation.

166
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:38,349
Speaker 1: I like.

167
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:40,637
Speaker 1: I just buy them on Amazon.

168
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:41,580
Speaker 0: How much does that cost?

169
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:42,788
Speaker 1: I don't know.

170
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:43,599
Speaker 1: like 20 bucks a season.

171
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,592
Speaker 0: So how many seasons of say like, you know of that show are there?

172
00:12:46,873 --> 00:12:47,777
Speaker 0: like seven.

173
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,063
Speaker 0: so he's paying $140 to watch seven.

174
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:58,485
Speaker 1: I used to pay $140 for one fucking season of anime and also More to the point.

175
00:12:58,686 --> 00:13:01,120
Speaker 1: I pirated the first season six seasons adventure brothers.

176
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,891
Speaker 1: So I felt like I can give them the 20 bucks.

177
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,035
Speaker 0: That sounds like a better plan.

178
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fair.

179
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:19,780
Speaker 1: Like I'm paying for the shows that I'm continuing to watch But if I could watch them on a platform that I actually used other than Amazon I would Yeah, and I just I wish shows like this would just be on YouTube or be on crunchyroll.

180
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,240
Speaker 1: I do not want there to be a lot of streaming platform.

181
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:23,679
Speaker 1: I think I'd be like four.

182
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:24,924
Speaker 0: I think that they like made.

183
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:29,280
Speaker 0: they made this deal with this other platform because they weren't making enough money on the youtubes.

184
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:30,468
Speaker 0: But it's like guys.

185
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:31,374
Speaker 0: that is a problem.

186
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:36,775
Speaker 0: Just go on YouTube take the pittance of YouTube money and then sell the merch.

187
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:38,000
Speaker 0: look how much you know.

188
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:43,760
Speaker 0: The we love finds got all those like cat bugs and puppy cat plushies and shit and you know what?

189
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:50,649
Speaker 0: I can't imagine that sales of those are going up because I see when I see that booth at cons It has less of those things at it than it used to.

190
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,251
Speaker 0: why?

191
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:55,939
Speaker 0: because you're not making a bunch of fans And you're not getting fans because no one can see your shit.

192
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:59,760
Speaker 0: You're better off making an army of fans and then making money later.

193
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:04,800
Speaker 0: Then you are trying to make money off the fans you got see less in comic books.

194
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:09,174
Speaker 1: So speaking of the monetization models of anime I want to.

195
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:15,200
Speaker 1: there's two issues Around something that has been creeping into my Twitter timeline called otaku coin.

196
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:23,885
Speaker 1: Luckily most of the people who run into otaku coin run into it in the context of someone else saying it's a scam and them Saying wait, what's this thing?

197
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:27,140
Speaker 1: But for those of you who are unaware, why are you even talking about this?

198
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,451
Speaker 0: You're you're making people aware of this when we should really.

199
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:32,960
Speaker 0: just if the more you talk about it the more you inflate it.

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,147
Speaker 0: He's not mention it so that goes away.

201
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:37,956
Speaker 1: you say that a lot, but there is no evidence.

202
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:39,060
Speaker 1: that is true in media.

203
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:56,462
Speaker 1: In fact, there's more evidence that Positive coverage from biased outlets coupled with lack of negative coverage from other people not talking about something is way more dangerous and that negative attention generally does not increase the scope of Adoption.

204
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:57,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz look you have.

205
00:14:57,907 --> 00:14:59,112
Speaker 0: you basically have people.

206
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:04,894
Speaker 0: even if there's one person saying oh my god otaku coins Oh my god, if everyone else just shuts up otaku will be a small thing.

207
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,360
Speaker 0: less people even know it exists.

208
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:13,300
Speaker 0: See you say The evidence is the opposite by everyone continuing to even mention its name.

209
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,691
Speaker 0: You know spread its name and everyone knows what the fuck it is.

210
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,620
Speaker 0: All right, that's not good.

211
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:22,580
Speaker 1: Well aside from the lack of evidence to back anything you just said the deal with otaku coin.

212
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:25,108
Speaker 1: Is that in my personal opinion?

213
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:26,211
Speaker 1: It's just a scam.

214
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:26,913
Speaker 0: It's everything.

215
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:27,375
Speaker 0: anything.

216
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:28,257
Speaker 0: coin is a scam.

217
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:29,080
Speaker 0: We know this already.

218
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,148
Speaker 1: We know this a lot of other people don't.

219
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:34,380
Speaker 0: how do you not don't go do any bullshit with fucking coins?

220
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,228
Speaker 1: God, dude the SEC made a website that was a fake coin.

221
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:47,054
Speaker 1: that was like obviously like the fakest shit and If you click to try to buy any it takes you to another SEC page.

222
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:49,200
Speaker 1: that is like yo, you just got tricked.

223
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,380
Speaker 1: Let me tell you how these things are scams.

224
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,043
Speaker 0: Yeah They should have.

225
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:56,634
Speaker 0: this is because people spread all this kept talking about bitcoins.

226
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:58,720
Speaker 0: people just shut up and ignored the Bitcoin.

227
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,902
Speaker 0: No What happened?

228
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:03,836
Speaker 1: if people who are critical of something just shut up then you've seen it all.

229
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,020
Speaker 1: ground to the grifters.

230
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:06,559
Speaker 0: You shouldn't shut what you know.

231
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:12,929
Speaker 0: It's not that you should shut up completely is you should not mention the name of the evil thing You should be like don't you know?

232
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,700
Speaker 0: saying don't do any coin bullshit.

233
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:19,780
Speaker 0: But when you have all these, you know news articles like Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin actually saying the name of the thing.

234
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,668
Speaker 0: It's like people can Beetlejuice, right?

235
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:24,419
Speaker 0: It's suddenly like the Google traffic on the thing goes up.

236
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:27,179
Speaker 0: I mean all the people on Facebook will start, you know.

237
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,260
Speaker 0: So if you believe that sky has a carry-on effect where all the marketers will try to get on top of it.

238
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,519
Speaker 0: You know and everything and people start writing articles about it because it's a big term.

239
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,600
Speaker 0: Right, don't say the word and then it won't become a big deal.

240
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,814
Speaker 1: Okay again aside from the fact that there's zero evidence to back up all your baseless assertions deal with otaku coin.

241
00:16:47,315 --> 00:17:05,460
Speaker 1: is that the scam here is That they want to get nerds to use these coins to choose like which anime get funded like it's supposed to be this Democratization of anime production that the coin is the currency to tell the anime industry what shows should be invested in.

242
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:07,627
Speaker 0: How do you get the coin?

243
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,579
Speaker 1: So that's the part I'm not gonna get into because it's all just a fucking scam.

244
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,042
Speaker 0: You just buy.

245
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,290
Speaker 0: you just buy them with real money.

246
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,064
Speaker 0: I don't even know Why don't you know you?

247
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:18,094
Speaker 0: what you could do is you could just say hey, here's a website.

248
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:19,780
Speaker 0: Here's a bunch of animes listed.

249
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,688
Speaker 0: Donate real money to the ones you want made.

250
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:24,796
Speaker 0: Why do you need these coins as an intermediary?

251
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:25,839
Speaker 0: What effect do they have?

252
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:31,480
Speaker 1: Wait, see donating money to corporations nakedly already runs into weird tax issues.

253
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:34,330
Speaker 0: So you're basically just using a coin to avoid taxes.

254
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,220
Speaker 1: No, it's way worse than that the real issue.

255
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:52,079
Speaker 1: So the real issue here the fundamental the the core premise coins aside is a problem and this is Increasingly becoming a problem in all fandoms like the Star Wars fandom is because total horseshit.

256
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,400
Speaker 1: now We're gonna talk about some horseshit anime in a second.

257
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:09,905
Speaker 1: But so the problem is that fans of anime and fans of movies and fans of things these days Feel like because they're a fan of something that they should have some agency and ownership around the production of the thing They're a fan of.

258
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,460
Speaker 0: and that's utterly wrong.

259
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:19,260
Speaker 1: And that is a big part of why there's such a horrible toxic community around pretty much every fandom these days.

260
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:26,300
Speaker 0: Well, that's because you know part of it is big just because nowadays the tools of production are democratized.

261
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyone can make stuff right.

262
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:32,060
Speaker 0: so in a world where anyone can make stuff, right?

263
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,799
Speaker 0: Even though you don't have the resources to make you know, something real.

264
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:36,768
Speaker 0: I mean you you guys.

265
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:47,759
Speaker 0: you could theoretically if you spent all fucking day sitting at your computer Learning everything and working crazy hard and somehow eating only ramen or whatever Eventually make a real legit movie, but good luck

266
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:53,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not just that it's that fans will like they'll get invested in like they think a character should be treated.

267
00:18:53,223 --> 00:19:01,286
Speaker 0: No But I say like because you can create stuff right and be in by creating stuff and usually creating fan works Utilizing other people's stuff.

268
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, right you.

269
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:04,697
Speaker 0: now you're not just conceiving.

270
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:09,052
Speaker 0: the people who are pure Consumers are no longer just pure consumers.

271
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:11,100
Speaker 0: You're writing your fan fictions of Harry Potter.

272
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:17,680
Speaker 0: You feel like you're part of the Harry Potter deal and you can't make your fan fictions contradict the cannon.

273
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if the cannon is messed up and it doesn't go with your fan fictions anymore Now you're mad and such and such right?

274
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:35,040
Speaker 0: So it's like you, you know, if we're all working, you know instead of having the Original creators used to have this status of I write everything and you consume and you don't make anything.

275
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:46,500
Speaker 0: All you do is consume whereas now they've been demoted to more of a you know Lead leader among the partners who create in the same world, even though they didn't say that people just do it.

276
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,980
Speaker 0: Anyway, they just do it because you can't stop them, right?

277
00:19:49,160 --> 00:20:04,448
Speaker 1: everyone's got a copy of Adobe Premiere and Photoshop and it and a word processor and also create on in and you can't stop or the Individual people involved in production are now more accessible to randos Like they might have a Twitter like you.

278
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:09,026
Speaker 1: look in the credits and look up someone's name and Google them and find their Facebook And start harassing them.

279
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:11,700
Speaker 1: and also your head cannon didn't reach out.

280
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,840
Speaker 0: Well, and also in the olden days, right if I read a book and the book doesn't jive with you.

281
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,797
Speaker 0: First of all, even if you complain no one can fucking hear you because you don't have the internet to complain on.

282
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:20,520
Speaker 0: right.

283
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:24,279
Speaker 0: But to that - that doesn't really disrupt your day, right?

284
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,030
Speaker 1: It's like someone in the chat was like we went from.

285
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,600
Speaker 1: the author is dead - we killed the author.

286
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:31,960
Speaker 0: It doesn't really mess with your day, right?

287
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,236
Speaker 0: Whereas consider say a video game especially right if you're playing a video game.

288
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:40,753
Speaker 0: that video game is like You know, especially an online video game and you're in the community of that game.

289
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,560
Speaker 0: You're playing it maybe even competitively.

290
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:43,907
Speaker 0: You're heavily involved.

291
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:47,927
Speaker 0: if they change the rules of the game, you know The author's the people who run the game.

292
00:20:47,987 --> 00:21:02,440
Speaker 0: if League of Legends adds a character removes a character changes a rule Makes a patch nerfs like someone nerfs a card in a card game, right that actually affects your day Because you're so involved in it, right which is different from back in the day where someone changed something.

293
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:06,600
Speaker 0: You know the old the creator changes something it affects your life none.

294
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:25,558
Speaker 1: so I my take on otaku coin is that it's trying to combine the ridiculous buzz around cryptocurrencies, which are mostly scams in my opinion with entirely fan desire to control the industry that makes the things they watch.

295
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:47,276
Speaker 1: and They they're basically feeding into two very powerful forces among people who live in basements and generally don't have many Prospects in life so that if they have no control over their lives and they're just involuntarily in their basement being sad watching hentai Or whatever they can take their special magic cryptocurrency and use that to get the anime titties.

296
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:48,680
Speaker 1: They want produce, right?

297
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,580
Speaker 0: What's gonna happen if you someone spends a zillion otaku coins to get a specific anime titty produced?

298
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,041
Speaker 0: I think.

299
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,248
Speaker 0: and then that anime titty is not produced.

300
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:59,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, or what if it's produced but it's the wrong anime titty?

301
00:22:00,264 --> 00:22:01,120
Speaker 0: It's three titties like.

302
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:02,932
Speaker 0: What are they gonna do then?

303
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:07,109
Speaker 1: so Do not engage with the otaku coin.

304
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:08,274
Speaker 1: if you know anyone.

305
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:22,052
Speaker 1: don't engage with any coin ever But except like actual real money just because it's a coin But because it feeds into this toxic idea that people who are fans of things Gain, some sort of inherent ownership in the things of which their fans.

306
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:24,098
Speaker 0: if anyone believes in coin, right?

307
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,166
Speaker 0: Tell them All right, you believe in coins.

308
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:27,069
Speaker 0: You think they have value?

309
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:27,370
Speaker 0: All right.

310
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,474
Speaker 0: I just made Scott coin.

311
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,120
Speaker 0: you work eight hours a day.

312
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,925
Speaker 0: It's your full-time job.

313
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:32,033
Speaker 0: I'll pay you in Scott coin.

314
00:22:32,053 --> 00:22:33,020
Speaker 0: Why don't we make Scott coin?

315
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,408
Speaker 0: I mean I could make it right now, but yeah, we could issue.

316
00:22:35,428 --> 00:22:38,079
Speaker 1: we could issue it to the bad the stream and the patreon.

317
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:41,610
Speaker 0: Sure, everyone you get a billion Scott coins.

318
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,313
Speaker 0: They're worth nothing.

319
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,120
Speaker 1: I'm saying we only issue like six of them.

320
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,369
Speaker 1: Just six why?

321
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,174
Speaker 1: I don't know.

322
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:57,639
Speaker 1: see what happens but anyway things of the day.

323
00:22:58,141 --> 00:23:03,378
Speaker 1: So I found this really cute comic and I think you've probably seen it around.

324
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:05,568
Speaker 0: people retweet it Hadn't until you tweeted it.

325
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:06,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

326
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:10,652
Speaker 1: uh, I Seen some of these comics before but now I see where it came from.

327
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:13,182
Speaker 1: It's just poorly drawn lines They don't.

328
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:14,588
Speaker 0: they seem not so poorly drawn.

329
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:16,355
Speaker 1: They're better drawn than anything I could ever draw.

330
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:18,821
Speaker 1: Sure, but I Don't know.

331
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:21,351
Speaker 1: This is my type of very simply humor.

332
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:23,480
Speaker 1: It's like Perry Bible Fellowship adjacent.

333
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,869
Speaker 1: Is how I described this type of humor?

334
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:28,436
Speaker 0: humor adjacent?

335
00:23:28,697 --> 00:23:32,631
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, just be a crab don't fuck this up.

336
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:35,060
Speaker 1: I really like this comic and I hope you do too.

337
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,127
Speaker 0: Somebody got.

338
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:40,855
Speaker 0: oh, so this thing happened like a little while ago.

339
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:46,453
Speaker 0: It's not the newest news But it's it's actually like continuing to snowball a bit.

340
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:48,159
Speaker 0: It didn't just stop when it hit its end.

341
00:23:48,862 --> 00:24:07,880
Speaker 0: So late last year some I think some girl somewhere She made his Twitter account called like weezer Africa and she basically just wanted weezer The rock band to cover the song Africa by Toto, you know the song That song so which is a meme ish song.

342
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:16,668
Speaker 1: well The song is these days the songs really like on the upswing in terms of being used in memes and it's been stuck in my Head for like a year now for some reason.

343
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:16,969
Speaker 1: Yeah.

344
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,810
Speaker 0: No, it's it's a big song in meme land along this day No one seems to live with like ocean man.

345
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:34,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, and a couple other and sandstorm Anyway, but this person really really really wanted weezer to cover the song and it started a Twitter account Weezer to cover this dedicated solely to this purpose.

346
00:24:36,162 --> 00:24:47,335
Speaker 0: And so and then they started cleverly tweeting they made really clever tweets Trying to encourage weezer to cover the song and then they got followers and then they got like wrecking.

347
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:52,209
Speaker 0: somehow people discovered this Twitter account that was dedicated to one purpose and one purpose only.

348
00:24:52,229 --> 00:25:02,089
Speaker 0: and Like, you know radio stations, I think some morning shows talked about it or it was written up in some You know local schmo papers and you know, I started to get attention, right?

349
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:07,067
Speaker 0: And then over time there's only it took like a few months right.

350
00:25:07,148 --> 00:25:16,186
Speaker 0: eventually Like it actually got noticed and weezer Hosted a cover on Spotify of a different song by Toto.

351
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:22,350
Speaker 1: That was not Africa That is a plus that responds.

352
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:25,538
Speaker 0: And then they actually did eventually cover.

353
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:28,687
Speaker 1: Africa looks like weezer finally bless the reins.

354
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:29,870
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly.

355
00:25:31,832 --> 00:25:33,617
Speaker 0: And now they're going even further.

356
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,930
Speaker 0: they're like performing it somewhere with the guy from Toto on Jimmy Kimmel apparently.

357
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's yesterday, right?

358
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,170
Speaker 0: It's it's like getting bigger and bigger all the time.

359
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:52,430
Speaker 0: So I didn't find out about it until like maybe a week before They actually did the cover and like I sort of put it out of my mind and it didn't become a thing of today.

360
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:56,150
Speaker 0: And then it happened and I saw that news and then I forgot about it.

361
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:00,009
Speaker 0: But the fact that it's still going and like I can't believe it's snowballing.

362
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:03,825
Speaker 0: It seems like the kind of thing that was like, ah, they covered it the end.

363
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,017
Speaker 0: No, it's not the end It's gonna keep going.

364
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,910
Speaker 0: What other song will they cover next?

365
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:16,789
Speaker 0: I feel like who else will attempt to make a Twitter account with one Small dedicated purpose and fail because this is the only person who can ever do it and have it be a thing.

366
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:26,828
Speaker 0: It'll hit the peak when Rick Astley maybe in like ten years someone else can try this again when everyone's forgotten about this and try to make someone do something with a one Twitter account or whatever it is.

367
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:27,229
Speaker 0: in ten years.

368
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:38,570
Speaker 1: The two possible peaks for this are either Rick Astley covers Africa or There is a world tour concert of a ton of famous acts and all they do is each cover Africa.

369
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:46,930
Speaker 0: We should have Toto cover Weezer Ooh Dara Day cover everything and then Dara Day covers everyone else and then everyone else does a sandstorm.

370
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:48,663
Speaker 1: Is Toto even like still around?

371
00:26:48,683 --> 00:26:49,530
Speaker 1: I guess they're still around.

372
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:50,184
Speaker 0: I don't know.

373
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:50,692
Speaker 1: Like.

374
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,990
Speaker 1: I don't know what bands are alive or dead or like.

375
00:26:53,010 --> 00:27:00,570
Speaker 0: If you live in New York City, meta moment All right, so into the meta moments All right.

378
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:17,449
Speaker 0: I can't believe they're still alive, which is why I just thought of it.

379
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:25,607
Speaker 0: Performers of such great hits as Celebrate Jungle Boogie What really?

380

Speaker 1: Geek Nights presents Utena.

390
00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:02,617
Speaker 1: We did put an episode out.

391
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:14,170
Speaker 1: I'm already doing pre-production for episode 17 Which is an actual non-nanami like good dual episode and Otherwise follow our YouTube stuff and join the Geek Nights forum.

392
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:22,910
Speaker 1: there's been a slight uptick in forum activity recently as a few people when I say a few like two people but

393
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:25,378
Speaker 0: Oh honest rim appeared what

394
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:31,783
Speaker 1: have both expressed that they're used because the Geek Nights forum We had it used to be way bigger and people kind of scattered to the line

395
00:28:31,803 --> 00:28:33,170
Speaker 0: goes up and down and up and down.

396
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:41,917
Speaker 0: Usually like what will happen is like a listener will come and hang out for a while when they make an account and then go away, yeah, but You're all fucking lurking.

397
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:44,249
Speaker 0: there's a shit ton of lurkers cuz I can see you.

398
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:46,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can see your numbers at least how many of you.

399
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:58,874
Speaker 0: there are a lot of you But the people there are people who have to get into the point where you make a habit of keeping it open in a tab And like constantly reloading it like once a day and once you get to that point That's when you're.

400
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:01,590
Speaker 0: and a lot of people have that habit, but they never post because they're lurkers.

401
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:10,203
Speaker 0: But then there's other people who have that same habit and also aren't afraid to type Yeah, and we need more of those people cuz that's like 10% of the people.

402
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:20,537
Speaker 1: one of my favorite things is when someone says something controversial or that might that could clearly cause an argument and you see a little icon that shows like eight people all Simultaneously type.

403
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:27,509
Speaker 0: it shows you when someone is typing Which is great because a lot of times I'll write a long post and then delete it.

404
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, not post it and people hold.

405
00:29:29,238 --> 00:29:31,048
Speaker 0: someone knew that I was typing something.

406
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:35,990
Speaker 0: Yeah They're waiting for it and I never got posted or I come back later and I write it again.

407
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:52,862
Speaker 1: But the forums getting at this slight uptick in activity and the sentiment seems to be that Other places people had gone to for their like fandom specific talk have gotten increasingly Toxic for all the same reasons.

408
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:53,950
Speaker 1: We just talked about what they're talking.

409
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:57,943
Speaker 0: I think I think this is a general effect and also a summer effect.

410
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,170
Speaker 0: Is that people who have kids around school?

411
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:02,729
Speaker 0: Well, it's like people who kids are at school.

412
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:08,130
Speaker 0: People in the summer are going out and doing stuff and not sitting home posting online, right?

413
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,960
Speaker 0: And just in general people who had people were good.

414
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,568
Speaker 0: people have better shit to do than post.

415
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:20,063
Speaker 0: That like posting an online communities tweeting Facebooking Instagramming.

416
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,350
Speaker 0: None of these things like necessities in life.

417
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:23,948
Speaker 0: You could just never do any of those things.

418
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:31,010
Speaker 0: Most people never do any of those things and the benefit of doing those things is actually not that great.

419
00:30:31,393 --> 00:30:33,109
Speaker 0: Well, I just do it because I like doing it.

420
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:34,908
Speaker 0: Yeah It's the same as well.

421
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,586
Speaker 1: You know the other thing that geek nights used to complain about a lot and we do less now that we live in the city Where these don't exist.

422
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:46,950
Speaker 1: Homeowners associations the people who run homeowners associations tend to be the worst people with the least to do, right?

423
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:50,489
Speaker 0: So the people who post online are the worst people who at the least to do.

424
00:30:51,354 --> 00:30:53,629
Speaker 0: And then the people who just really enjoy doing it like us.

425
00:30:53,931 --> 00:31:02,410
Speaker 1: but the fact course we're not the best people but the fact that the geek nights forum has a Higher barrier to entry than most other online community.

426
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:06,430
Speaker 1: Well, the reason is right is because if you're dumb you get run out of town on the horse.

427
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,378
Speaker 1: He rode in on right obvious reasons.

428
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,392
Speaker 0: number one to become a member you have to be Accepted right?

429
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:21,701
Speaker 0: you you put an application and you write down a reason for joining and a lot of people I think may have been Valid joiners, but their reason for joining wasn't like.

430
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:26,276
Speaker 0: some people have written stuff like want to talk about video games And that was probably a real person.

431
00:31:26,557 --> 00:31:27,340
Speaker 0: I've rejected that.

432
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:28,163
Speaker 0: I'm just like.

433
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:32,193
Speaker 0: first of all, I can't guarantee you're a real person Yeah and second of all That's not.

434
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:38,904
Speaker 0: you need to prove to me that like you're a geek nights listener who's actually interested in joining the community So at least a human being right.

435
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:41,419
Speaker 0: somebody, you know Someone wrote something as simple as like.

436
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,007
Speaker 0: I want to talk to other gig nights listeners.

437
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:43,430
Speaker 0: That's enough.

438
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:49,794
Speaker 0: I can tell that this is a real human being who wrote a complete set and Tell us you want to join the ivory tower.

439
00:31:49,814 --> 00:31:55,878
Speaker 0: right, you know something like that where I can tell aha, you know We've maintained a very high.

440
00:31:55,918 --> 00:31:57,284
Speaker 1: like the community like the.

441
00:31:57,345 --> 00:32:03,469
Speaker 1: the activity ebbs and flows But the community is pretty high bar Like you cannot get away with being a shithead in here.

442
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:07,950
Speaker 1: You get run out of town pretty quick and you get run out of town for by your own shame.

443
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:10,800
Speaker 1: Very few people have ever been banned from this forum.

444
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:11,182
Speaker 1: Yeah.

445
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:15,179
Speaker 0: No, it's it's usually just people who are The bad kind of person.

446
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:16,908
Speaker 0: it's not a comfortable place for them.

447
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:20,430
Speaker 0: Yeah It's the same way that like land is an uncomfortable place for a fish.

448
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:26,741
Speaker 1: Yeah, if if you need the if you need toxic misogyny to breathe you can have a lot of trouble breathing in the gig nights for us.

449
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:30,196
Speaker 1: So, uh, let's talk about Uma Musume.

450
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:36,375
Speaker 0: All right, so we saw this show first on when we did our judging anime by its cover Which we're gonna do it.

451
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:37,741
Speaker 0: We're gonna do it again soon.

452
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:38,303
Speaker 1: Yep.

453
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:39,790
Speaker 1: Now we've watched some of it.

454
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,721
Speaker 0: I watched one or two episodes that are remember.

455
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:43,290
Speaker 1: I watched one and a half episodes.

456
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:44,430
Speaker 1: I saw all I need to see right?

457
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:57,842
Speaker 0: So what the show is is basically what I thought it was gonna be was like a sports anime where the characters Happen to be girls, but they're horse girls not not like centaurs, but they're like cat girls But they have horse ears and horse tail now already.

458
00:32:57,882 --> 00:32:59,450
Speaker 1: I feel like that was a lost opportunity.

459
00:32:59,651 --> 00:33:07,123
Speaker 1: I was actually kind of disappointed that they were just girls with horse ears anyway And they participate in horse races like Kentucky Derby only Japan.

460
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:14,150
Speaker 0: Yep, whatever their horse racing equivalent is And they all they go to school for horse racing and that sort of thing.

461
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,070
Speaker 0: So I thought it was gonna be like a sports anime.

462
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,638
Speaker 0: I really like your pedal or high-q.

463
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:19,661
Speaker 1: I felt it was gonna like.

464
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:22,730
Speaker 1: I really love it was gonna follow the battle athletes template.

465
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:25,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought it was gonna be a sports anime.

466
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:27,207
Speaker 0: only it just happened to be.

467
00:33:27,227 --> 00:33:38,190
Speaker 0: you know The characters happen to be these, you know horse girls and I thought we would learn about horse racing And taking care of horses, but that that characters happen to be this way to appeal to otakus, right?

468
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:44,243
Speaker 0: And I watched it and I was 50% correct, I'd say at least 50% correct.

469
00:33:44,584 --> 00:33:49,418
Speaker 0: the thing I did not count on was That reveal in the second half of the first episode.

470
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:50,642
Speaker 1: Is that the show like?

471
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:53,270
Speaker 0: there's some perversion going on which totally saw that coming?

472
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get back to that.

473
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:54,996
Speaker 0: That's obvious.

474
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:55,939
Speaker 0: That's obvious.

475
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,470
Speaker 1: It's not the kind of perversion I expected and it's arguably way worse.

476
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:00,896
Speaker 1: Yes, but I expected.

477
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,689
Speaker 0: the thing I did not expect is that it would also be an idol show.

478
00:34:04,152 --> 00:34:05,609
Speaker 0: I dad did not know that at all.

479
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:16,349
Speaker 0: But apparently the deal is that when you if you win a horse race then you go that horse girl gets to go on stage and perform at their idol song or whatever.

480
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:27,219
Speaker 0: Even the really quiet horse who's the fastest girl ends up going on stage and singing like without any Cowardice at all.

481
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:39,134
Speaker 1: So on one hand you can make this like Metanarrative argument that the show is about the dehumanization of the idol like the process of creating idols in modern pop Music production.

482
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:42,344
Speaker 0: they compete and fight with each other in order for the chance to sing on stage.

483
00:34:42,364 --> 00:34:43,527
Speaker 1: They're commoditized.

484
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:48,543
Speaker 1: the reward They're given is just being more productive for the company that groomed.

485
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,510
Speaker 1: that like you can make this whole argument.

486
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:54,250
Speaker 0: But no, it's just for otaku fan service.

487
00:34:54,290 --> 00:35:00,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, this show is so people who want to see cute horse girls interacting in a semi moe.

488
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:06,330
Speaker 0: semi sports Like half moe is one horse is one horse girl for every different possible personality.

489
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:07,797
Speaker 0: So there's gonna be your favorite one.

490
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:10,810
Speaker 1: It's the harem show where there's no self insert character.

491
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,890
Speaker 1: It's just the harem interacting with itself, right?

492
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:18,830
Speaker 0: The plot is basically like the school has the elite horse racing team and then there's the joke horse racing team.

493
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,670
Speaker 0: And of course the joke one is gonna eventually become the super one.

494
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:31,961
Speaker 0: And the joke team is basically two joke girls the main character and the best horse racing girl who just Who's like the champion who just quit the good team for some reason.

495
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:34,570
Speaker 0: and you know when the the new girl is?

496
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:42,586
Speaker 0: oh my god, she came from the you know, the the What's it called the sticks and she took the train into the city of Tokyo for the first time.

497
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:48,890
Speaker 0: just like every other anime She doesn't know how to use the subway Transfer student and oh my god now she's moved to the big city.

498
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:51,870
Speaker 0: She's a horse from the country right obvious main character.

499
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,579
Speaker 0: but the the main What's it called?

500
00:35:58,755 --> 00:35:59,285
Speaker 0: Hey, whatever.

501
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:04,100
Speaker 0: No, the one is the super fast horse girl.

502
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:06,750
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah the one who's like the number one most popular horse.

503
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's like all super quiet this one.

504
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's like a mystery of why silent Suzuka, right?

505
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,890
Speaker 0: Why did she quit the super team to come to the joke team?

506
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,938
Speaker 1: There's probably a plot there.

507
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:27,198
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna watch much more of this But when it when the the main character comes to the city for the first time she randomly encounters some pervy, dude This is the part that bothers me the show.

508
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:30,710
Speaker 0: I mean she takes him in the face like a horse and he doesn't die though.

509
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looked like he did it first.

510
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:36,910
Speaker 0: Oh, she can run super fast cuz she's a horse, but it looks like a girl except for the tails and ear.

511
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:45,210
Speaker 1: Well, so we got to talk a little bit about the conceit of the show because the conceit of the show is our real life.

512
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:59,184
Speaker 1: Universe exists and the souls of horses from our universe get transferred Randomly as far as we can tell Into pregnant women in this other mirror universe.

513
00:36:59,224 --> 00:37:03,058
Speaker 1: that is the same as our universe Except all horses are just horse girls.

514
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:05,186
Speaker 0: I thought that it was there.

515
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:06,230
Speaker 0: My mom fucked a horse.

516
00:37:06,832 --> 00:37:07,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, didn't you watch the?

517
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:09,163
Speaker 1: the intro explains this?

518
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:10,630
Speaker 0: No, I did not.

519
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:15,084
Speaker 1: Yeah souls of horses end up from our world end up in this world like that's it.

520
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,790
Speaker 1: they just get right past that.

521
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:23,790
Speaker 0: Also the all the horse characters have names that are similar to the kinds of names that race horses have.

522
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:28,883
Speaker 1: I saw most actual names of race horses from really what's her name like special week.

523
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:37,567
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're all real horses, which means I Hope that both of these nuts is gonna show up be the real main character and like that isn't far.

524
00:37:37,587 --> 00:37:41,039
Speaker 0: both of these nuts Both of these nuts appears in a movie.

525
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,369
Speaker 0: somebody let me know and I will start watching again.

526
00:37:44,313 --> 00:37:59,269
Speaker 1: No, it does a lot of cute things right like when the girls use a phone They like hold the earpiece up to their real ear and then they like bring it down to talk like it solved the problem Of why is that cat girl holding a cell phone next to the side of her head instead of her ear?

527
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:10,717
Speaker 1: but What bothers me and the main reason I'm not gonna watch the rest of the show at all other than the fact that it's kind of just dumb yeah is that It wasn't perverted in the ways.

528
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:14,670
Speaker 1: I expected it wasn't just like that low-key fanservice you get from these.

529
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:18,690
Speaker 0: I think there is some horses with big boobs or yeah sexy legs or whatever.

530
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:24,294
Speaker 1: I kind of expected that to be the level of like creepy fanservice But it wasn't.

531
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:28,648
Speaker 1: the creepy part was that we're introduced to this character who's an important recurring character who?

532
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:40,268
Speaker 1: straight up assaults the main character in Episode one like multiple times and that is already normalized in the show as well.

533
00:38:40,288 --> 00:38:41,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a horse girl.

534
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,741
Speaker 1: You got to like check out her whatever.

535
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:55,249
Speaker 0: you got a groper legs yeah, see how strong she is and then person to me become is like the coach of the crappy team and Somehow is obviously some sort of genius who's gonna help them all win.

536
00:38:55,616 --> 00:39:01,104
Speaker 1: Yeah His strategies that character should not still be in the show and suddenly all the.

537
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:11,085
Speaker 0: but they totally trust him even though He just groped them yeah multiple times in the first episode Like the narrative around that character, and they don't resolve it in any way.

538
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:12,490
Speaker 0: It's just like what we trust him now.

539
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:13,510
Speaker 0: I guess he's our coach.

540
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,555
Speaker 0: He's gonna help us win.

541
00:39:14,876 --> 00:39:21,229
Speaker 1: if that scene in the first episode had instead been He died when he was kicked and we never hear of that again.

542
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:27,430
Speaker 1: That would have been fine, but the fact that he is an important character that his relationship with all these girls.

543
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,923
Speaker 1: That alone is actually a reason to just not watch this show as we agree.

544
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:35,741
Speaker 1: like I'm not gonna watch any more of the show I watched enough to be able to review it.

545
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:41,400
Speaker 1: It's light-hearted Generic anime high production value.

546
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:43,810
Speaker 1: look at all these girls that are acting in a school.

547
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:47,460
Speaker 0: There's also tons of like music because they sing whenever someone wins a race.

548
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:50,228
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really well animated like everything about.

549
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:50,850
Speaker 1: it's beautiful.

550
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,995
Speaker 0: It's really colorful because yeah I do appreciate like.

551
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:58,550
Speaker 1: it is really really colorful, and there's a lot of characters, and it's pretty typical anime.

552
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,918
Speaker 1: But I can't say that I recommend it to anyone to actually watch.

553
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:11,847
Speaker 0: if you're an otaku who likes idols and shit and doesn't mind Some you know all these girls getting groped by this dude, and oh you know only being mad once.

554
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:12,510
Speaker 0: yep

555
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:17,316
Speaker 1: Like I don't the fact that they just let that go and don't bring it up again Not cool, then

556
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:24,046
Speaker 0: you can watch this show if you're you know if you're the kind of otaku who will buy a body pillow unironically and have it in your bed and the shows the shows for you.

557
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:29,650
Speaker 1: or I guess if you're On the other side of the coin you can just watch Monstume or Sume and get like an actual centaur.

558
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:31,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, go full go.

559
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,440
Speaker 1: if you're gonna go horse anyway Why don't I go all the way just have like a giant centaur?

560
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:37,147
Speaker 0: if they were centaurs the show would be better.

561
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:42,762
Speaker 1: because yeah Well, then when she kicked that dude He would have actually died and that would have been the end of that stupid arc.

562
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:44,850
Speaker 0: if a horse kicks you you'll probably die.

563
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:51,844
Speaker 0: Yeah I Think that there's one nice scene where it's like.

564
00:40:51,865 --> 00:40:53,735
Speaker 0: she's at the train station And she's like one.

565
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:56,670
Speaker 0: she got off this train too early or late like a station away from her.

566
00:40:56,731 --> 00:41:02,050
Speaker 0: She's just like no I'll just run and she just runs to the next station faster than all the cars cuz she's a horse.

567
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:03,776
Speaker 1: that's one thing I do appreciate though.

568
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:14,775
Speaker 1: the show is very married to its core conceits and Little kind of like my little pony actually did this to very small details That relate to those things.

569
00:41:14,836 --> 00:41:19,353
Speaker 1: like their horses they run whatever are Appropriate and always right.

570
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:37,350
Speaker 1: like the consistency of the treatment of those little world details is extreme to the point that the Kanji for the word horse in the show is Basically the real kanji for the word horse except it removed like two of the legs Like little details like that.

571
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:48,729
Speaker 1: I really appreciate when a show has this almost slavish consistency on these really dumb minor points But otherwise, I don't think the show is actually worth watching and I don't think anyone should really bother watching it.

572
00:41:49,010 --> 00:42:07,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want to watch a sports show you can watch you a pedal where the last episode that I saw Basically, they spent the it was they were 50 minutes from the finish line of the second day of a three-day race and at the End of the episode they had still not crossed the finish line But they had done flashbacks of the three characters who could possibly cross that finish line first.

573
00:42:08,354 --> 00:42:10,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean initial D for all I love it.

574
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:15,290
Speaker 1: It's a bunch of non race episodes and then an episode that's getting ready for the race.

575
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:21,230
Speaker 0: Well the problem in initial D you're racing a bunch of different people in the separate races and your pedal It's pretty much there.

576
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:26,370
Speaker 0: There's all these other races, but they only care about this inter high race for every high school in Japan races against each other.

577
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,029
Speaker 0: They don't care about any other race.

578
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:29,195
Speaker 0: So it's pretty much.

579
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:40,885
Speaker 0: there'll be a few episodes like half a season of you know Characters developing and setting up and then the rest of the show for another season and a half is just the race and then They do it again three times cuz high school is three years.

580
00:42:41,368 --> 00:42:45,068
