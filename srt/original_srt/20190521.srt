1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,298
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, May 21st, 2019.

2
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:12,160
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:14,486
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:14,867
Speaker 0: 2p 2c.

5
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:18,829
Speaker 0: We're talking about two-player games.

6
00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:20,888
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:28,330
Speaker 0: So I got to play like risk of rain some other games so we can do some new game reviews.

8
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:36,040
Speaker 1: But I've been mostly a lot of video games and up until like a week or two ago and remember in planning He just was playing one game.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,738
Speaker 0: Well, I keep playing two-player board games Overwatch and some autochess.

10
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:47,071
Speaker 0: I'm basically just playing those games Over.

11
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:49,881
Speaker 0: I kind of got back into overwatch in a big way.

12
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:51,126
Speaker 0: I stopped a while ago.

13
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,170
Speaker 0: Remember I said fuck it.

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,615
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna worry about my rank.

15
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:55,943
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna always play competitive no matter what.

16
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:57,810
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna play competitive solo queue.

17
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,633
Speaker 0: Let's see what happens.

18
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:00,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't care about my rank in autochess.

19
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:05,776
Speaker 0: I just play and now that I've been doing that Kind of in that mode.

20
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:09,190
Speaker 0: I was in at RIT when we just played tribes 2 and literally nothing.

21
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:10,883
Speaker 1: There's no rank in tribes 2.

22
00:01:10,883 --> 00:01:11,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, but was there?

23
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:14,499
Speaker 0: No, we just joined a server.

24
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,343
Speaker 1: I forget it.

25
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:16,690
Speaker 1: There might have been some kind of ranking.

26
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,410
Speaker 0: There was the clan ranking system.

27
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:19,856
Speaker 1: It was something but we didn't.

28
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:24,917
Speaker 0: we formed that clan and then you and I were the only ones who kept playing the game Seriously, so we didn't actually bother using any of it.

29
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:26,543
Speaker 0: Anyway, god that game.

30
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:29,070
Speaker 0: we used to use it as almost a social network anyway.

31
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:40,650
Speaker 0: So yeah, I've played a lot of overwatch and I'm consistently surprised actually how Like non-toxic and chill almost everyone I play with in the range.

32
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:44,482
Speaker 1: Everyone else has already been kicked out or banned or went through a different game.

33
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:46,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're pretty aggressively banning the shitty people.

34
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:58,037
Speaker 0: I also found that all the really salty shitty people are in the low silvers and if you don't get whenever you're not down there anymore Everyone's just way nicer Like everyone's just more chill.

35
00:01:58,298 --> 00:02:00,990
Speaker 0: It's kind of like when you go hiking like if you're an angry person.

36
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:10,179
Speaker 0: You know, this is a correlation between like, you know being angry because I'm bad at over chat overwatch Right, I'm bad at overwatch because I'm angry.

37
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,773
Speaker 1: if you have like this, you know angry piece of shit I'll give you look.

38
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:17,650
Speaker 1: say like professional sports that you know where the people are more visible, right?

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,570
Speaker 1: It's like the number of people who are like at the top of their game.

40
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:23,928
Speaker 1: Who are angry mean?

41
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,918
Speaker 1: bastard Like disgusting people.

42
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:32,764
Speaker 1: it's like there are there's more than zero But it's like they're infamous and they know.

43
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:34,070
Speaker 1: everyone knows who they are.

44
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:40,630
Speaker 1: It's like a handful at any given time and they're everyone else in the whole rest of whatever League is like great person Yep.

45
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:48,070
Speaker 0: And then the bastard people tend to be like the shitty enforcer Like the fourth line grinder who sucks and is about to retire and hates his life.

46
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,370
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it's like people who are bad or like famous for being bad and everyone else is not bad.

47
00:02:54,202 --> 00:02:54,370
Speaker 0: Yeah.

48
00:02:56,354 --> 00:03:05,148
Speaker 0: So, uh, also we're playing some auto chess But I have not played with that new update that lets you actually Just lets you click on a dude then click on the board and not have to do any weird bullshit.

49
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:10,204
Speaker 0: Thanks Satan I do not need the skin of a MOBA around this game.

50
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:11,950
Speaker 0: I want the game to just be auto chess.

51
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,830
Speaker 1: They're trying hard with the quality of life improvements.

52
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:18,550
Speaker 1: Actually, I learned you know, cuz I play about like what one or two auto chess a day or whatever, right?

53
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,872
Speaker 1: No, I learned a bunch of info like game, you know Cuz I hate.

54
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:32,750
Speaker 1: it's something I still hate even about auto chess and every other game ever is Knowledge games meaning you're better at the game because you know stuff, right?

55
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,954
Speaker 1: I feel like if you read the rules and the rules should be public and in English for anyone to read for any game No matter how.

56
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:42,910
Speaker 1: come you know, even civilization is civil opedia, right?

57
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,098
Speaker 1: But even civilization even though you can just read the rules there.

58
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,904
Speaker 1: They are there's too much.

59
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:48,847
Speaker 0: No, there isn't.

60
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,391
Speaker 0: they're all really simple I don't know.

61
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:53,280
Speaker 1: Why can you tell me what every single building does?

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,830
Speaker 0: exact numbers show me the exact that you so one.

63
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,335
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

64
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:58,870
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do with that information?

65
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,290
Speaker 0: I'm just saying but I can tell you most of them all the ones that matter.

66
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:09,270
Speaker 1: I know exactly what I just say and that's like, you know in in overall Tells you an auto chat.

67
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:16,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got hurt, but it's like what if I don't have the guy on my screen right now and I'm like Oh, what is the what is enigma's power do?

68
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:17,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the problem.

69
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:23,410
Speaker 0: The problem is that auto chess as a real-time game means that you have to have this knowledge in your head.

70
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:24,394
Speaker 1: Definitely a word.

71
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:28,630
Speaker 1: knowledge is definitely a worse problem in real-time games than it is in non real-time game.

72
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:35,298
Speaker 0: Unless the games are primarily dexterity skill based or things like like overwatch You got to know what every character does.

73
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:38,350
Speaker 1: Street Fighter is dexterity based, but you have to know how to know all the moves.

74
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate.

75
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:40,737
Speaker 0: I know the hitbox.

76
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:41,480
Speaker 1: I don't like.

77
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,703
Speaker 1: and the price timing.

78
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,850
Speaker 1: I don't like testing knowledge.

79
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,495
Speaker 1: Right, cuz it's like.

80
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:51,410
Speaker 1: oh I actually would be better than this at you if I just like read a book, right?

81
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,121
Speaker 0: Okay, I do like games that do just test knowledge about a thing.

82
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:56,645
Speaker 0: Like I like quiz bowl.

83
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:57,749
Speaker 1: That's a trivia game.

84
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:58,836
Speaker 1: That's yeah That's different.

85
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm saying I like that kind of thing.

86
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,430
Speaker 1: But imagine like a game where it's like, okay, this game is testing to see who's faster.

87
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:09,548
Speaker 1: But if you don't know these ten arbitrary things, even if you're faster, you'll lose.

88
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:14,710
Speaker 0: Yep But every mile you've got to do a differential equation.

89
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:20,970
Speaker 1: So I learned some stuff that people who are you know, maybe dota or autochist players probably you're like, that's so obvious Scott.

90
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,896
Speaker 1: Why didn't you know?

91
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:24,230
Speaker 0: it's because because I don't read the documentation.

92
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:30,750
Speaker 0: I don't have time for that because autochist knowledge is a subset of like dota knowledge.

93
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:37,230
Speaker 1: It is so I've been able to learn over time just by playing a lot like the different item combinations.

94
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:46,159
Speaker 1: But Something I learned is that a there's this item called like the mask of madness And I knew that the mask of madness.

95
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:46,762
Speaker 1: to make it.

96
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,630
Speaker 1: you combine a mask and a quarter staff.

97
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:49,626
Speaker 1: Don't ask me how that works.

98
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:58,868
Speaker 1: And I knew what the mascot he hits yourself Like your attack speed and it's like really good item, but it silences you.

99
00:05:58,948 --> 00:05:59,910
Speaker 1: so I didn't know.

100
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:05,269
Speaker 1: It doesn't actually even say this even if you even if you hover over it just says silences whoever the hero who's wearing it.

101
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:06,816
Speaker 1: What does silence mean?

102
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:10,090
Speaker 1: it means that you don't use your your power.

103
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:14,106
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean that your race or class ability synergies are canceled.

104
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:15,190
Speaker 1: They're not right.

105
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,302
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean that any of your passive abilities are canceled.

106
00:06:19,523 --> 00:06:21,830
Speaker 1: It only means that your active ability is canceled.

107
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,104
Speaker 1: So if you put this on say kooka who shoots his big pirate ship, that's a bad idea.

108
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:27,730
Speaker 0: I don't know that character's name.

109
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:29,596
Speaker 1: It's the pirate ship guy.

110
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, I died.

111
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,346
Speaker 0: I know pirate ship guy, but that was Kooka.

112
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:37,030
Speaker 1: Okay, you nk It says right and the only reason I know the names because it shows them right there in the in the game.

113
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I thought that knowledge I do not have.

114
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,845
Speaker 1: it's the biggest word on the screen.

115
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,590
Speaker 1: the characters names in auto chess.

116
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,785
Speaker 0: I do not have proper noun permanence.

117
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:51,050
Speaker 1: anyway Pirate ship guy will only do will not do his pirate ship if you put that on him.

118
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,096
Speaker 0: So then why would you put it on?

119
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:53,443
Speaker 1: if you don't that's a bad idea.

120
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:53,685
Speaker 1: Yep.

121
00:06:54,248 --> 00:07:00,329
Speaker 1: Also Say for example Luna the the the night elf who rides the the lion.

122
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:01,914
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Remember that name for some reason.

123
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:04,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, her ability is passive.

124
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:06,850
Speaker 1: She throws the blades that bounce between guys.

125
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:07,949
Speaker 0: So you want to put it on her?

126
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:09,751
Speaker 1: Canceled.

127
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,897
Speaker 1: so it just makes her way awesome to put it on her.

128
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:21,298
Speaker 1: Yeah, but remembering that I still can't figure out which items Stack and which don't if I put two masks on the same, dude Do I get double or not?

129
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:22,384
Speaker 1: I don't know.

130
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:23,469
Speaker 1: I have to figure this out.

131
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:33,792
Speaker 1: But another thing I learned is that you know Guys do damage or take damage they get mana and when their mana bar fills up to a hundred that is when they will use Their ability.

132
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:39,270
Speaker 1: Yep, right and then they'll have no mana and then they'll build it up and use their ability again if they survive.

133
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:45,970
Speaker 0: That's why I use the things that make the mana build up faster on Specific dudes that have only want to use it and do to have a power.

134
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:53,061
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you were to say give a mana item to Luna It would do basically nothing because her mana doesn't even matter.

135
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:54,545
Speaker 1: Why does she even have mana?

136
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:55,930
Speaker 1: who the fuck made this game?

137
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:04,465
Speaker 1: Because remember this game is a mod of Dota, right, but it's like they shouldn't even let you put that item on there Because it does nothing.

138
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:07,697
Speaker 0: For think about where this came from.

139
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:12,029
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I know this kind of knowledge stuff is you know bullshit.

140
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:12,410
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

141
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,504
Speaker 0: It's not just not it's it's not.

142
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:15,410
Speaker 1: items don't stack.

143
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,443
Speaker 1: It should be like hey that person already has that item.

144
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,530
Speaker 1: putting it on them won't do anything.

145
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:29,873
Speaker 0: There is a also a difference between knowledge that is like intrinsic to the game itself Versus like knowledge of a cannon like some of these weird boards like Pax Pamir That game.

146
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:35,130
Speaker 0: if you know about that that area's history you will be better at the game.

147
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:40,150
Speaker 0: Hmm, but at the same time that game is arguably just like an exploration of that history.

148
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:46,657
Speaker 0: And but in a game like root if you read the rules of root, you know all the stuff you need to know to play Rude, but

149
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:48,229
Speaker 1: you know the cards a little bit

150
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:52,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, but but there's not that many and the cards are only in the context of the game.

151
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:59,050
Speaker 0: It's not like oh if you played boots back in the 90s, you'd know that this card is extra powerful, right?

152
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:00,130
Speaker 0: It's not like that.

153
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:09,350
Speaker 0: The problem here is that if you know how these heroes work because you play a shitload of dota a lot of things are more Intuitive to you, but they're also not explicitly stated.

154
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,221
Speaker 0: There's no there's no civil opedia in auto chess.

155
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:13,766
Speaker 0: that just explains all this.

156
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,329
Speaker 0: if I really want to know Yeah, I got a YouTube guy.

157
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:17,054
Speaker 1: I did so.

158
00:09:17,094 --> 00:09:19,730
Speaker 1: I did check out some YouTube guys and learn some stuff.

159
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,357
Speaker 0: I feel like I gotta check out YouTube guy.

160
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:22,321
Speaker 1: I also learn.

161
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:24,309
Speaker 1: I got to figure out which items stack and which don't.

162
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,236
Speaker 1: That's what I need to learn next.

163
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:27,722
Speaker 0: so in some news.

164
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:35,510
Speaker 0: You might have seen this but Unity posted a tweet unity the unity that makes the game a game engine good game engine.

165
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,770
Speaker 1: There's a lot of other unities out there.

166
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:44,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are a lot of unities out there, but the unity 3d game engine tweeted on May 17th So not that long ago.

167
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:49,896
Speaker 0: Oh Find the date here.

168
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,404
Speaker 0: they tweeted this.

169
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,068
Speaker 0: this doesn't say.

170
00:09:52,148 --> 00:10:02,662
Speaker 0: anyway They said and I quote we've recently delivered our first release of the year unity 2019.1 Which includes about 300 features, that's a lot of fucking features.

171
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:05,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they're probably counting really minor stuff.

172
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,050
Speaker 0: I mean when I release like an updated SDK like in the course of a quarter.

173
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:10,694
Speaker 0: We will be like.

174
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:11,943
Speaker 0: there are three features.

175
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:17,580
Speaker 0: We are adding yeah Many of which are especially helpful for developers.

176
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:19,566
Speaker 0: if they'd stop right there this would have been fine.

177
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:24,350
Speaker 1: in the game Every feature of a game engine necessarily be helpful for developers.

178
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:31,010
Speaker 0: There's no one other users that's the only user they have could be helpful to the monetization of the game engine itself.

179
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:33,381
Speaker 0: Yeah, we added a paywall sure.

180
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:47,010
Speaker 0: so basically unity announced The not thinking that this might be taken perhaps a different way from how they expected That they just released a shit ton of features that are helpful for game developers in the gambling industry.

181
00:10:47,211 --> 00:11:01,910
Speaker 1: I mean yeah, you go to any casino for years now like yeah If I was making a game going back like 10 20 years like I don't know I don't know when it started, but pretty much almost all modern slot machines are basically just fancy video game consoles.

182
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:03,227
Speaker 1: They're not that are really weak.

183
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:09,790
Speaker 1: They're like you know and are more secure than say an arcade machine, but the the slot machine is just a video game.

184
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,769
Speaker 1: That's like no shittier than the one on your phone.

185
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:21,075
Speaker 1: Yep You can actually go on your phone to any app store Google or iOS and there are plenty of apps that are literally just Slot machine, but no real money But just like the real slot machine.

186
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:23,283
Speaker 1: so I played one once to see.

187
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:30,350
Speaker 0: half the people who saw this tweet thought What loot boxes that shitty and that is not what they were talking about?

188
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,743
Speaker 0: But that is why the game industry is already having a problem with this.

189
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:36,890
Speaker 0: it was particularly poor timing for unity.

190
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:43,010
Speaker 0: But no this appears to be just features for the casino who wants to make a gambling video game.

191
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, unity is probably.

192
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,881
Speaker 1: you want to make a slot machine software.

193
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:47,146
Speaker 1: Unity is probably a good choice.

194
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,030
Speaker 1: You can make it look real fancy.

195
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's good slot machines.

196
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,910
Speaker 1: the programming of them is real simple.

197
00:11:52,050 --> 00:12:01,208
Speaker 1: It's randomize a number and then you that takes a fraction of a second right and then it's it's win or lose According to some odds, and then you're just like all right.

198
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:02,935
Speaker 1: well They they lost.

199
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:05,282
Speaker 1: what are we gonna show on the screen just to?

200
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:07,810
Speaker 1: that will equal that particular loss.

201
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,074
Speaker 1: Do we give them knobs?

202
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:10,659
Speaker 1: we fiddle and twiddle right?

203
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:11,081
Speaker 1: It's like.

204
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:11,803
Speaker 1: it's like let's.

205
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,910
Speaker 1: it's all about just showing a fancy animation.

206
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,967
Speaker 1: It's like you randomize you get a result, and then you need to show an a corresponding animation to that result.

207
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,796
Speaker 1: that will You know.

208
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:21,701
Speaker 1: it's all the art part.

209
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:25,937
Speaker 0: It's not if I made it as a toy It's just throwing pennies and quarters into a toilet.

210
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,181
Speaker 0: well simultaneously.

211
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:30,028
Speaker 0: There's like four fidget spinners attached to the toilet mmm.

212
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:33,742
Speaker 1: So I should make the instant slot machine.

213
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:44,490
Speaker 1: you put your money in It spins away it does max bet and spins away all your money according to the real odds as fast as possible.

214
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:45,415
Speaker 1: Right.

215
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:48,390
Speaker 1: so in a fraction of a second you put in like a thousand dollars, and it just goes.

216
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:51,755
Speaker 1: Here you go.

217
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:53,238
Speaker 1: your result is you lost everything?

218
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:59,316
Speaker 1: yeah, I spun and spun and spun until you either had zero or a jackpot Or a positive.

219
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:06,770
Speaker 1: if it's positive as soon as you go above your starting point We'll pause and let ask you if you want to continue, and if you hit zero will stop, huh?

220
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,655
Speaker 0: I feel like so effectively.

221
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:13,470
Speaker 1: you just do infinity spins with every press either stopping when you've made money or lost everything.

222
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:23,169
Speaker 0: I feel like there is an untapped and probably Immoral way to go with slot machines because slot machines are having a problem in that the only people use slot machines.

223
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:25,863
Speaker 1: It'll show you a print of all your individual spins.

224
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:27,230
Speaker 1: yeah along the way, that's it.

225
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,250
Speaker 0: That's the history that you need like that artifact?

226
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,594
Speaker 1: It doesn't but it is instantly like.

227
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:40,610
Speaker 0: but the only people use slot machines now are basically sad old people waiting for grim death to Finally take them so that the younger demographic is not going to Vegas to gamble.

228
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:47,850
Speaker 0: I feel like you could get a new Generation of people to sit in front of a slot machine and wait for grim death to give them sweet release.

229
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:55,590
Speaker 0: By making a progress quest style thing and like the UI make it not look like a shot slot machine.

230
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,178
Speaker 0: Make it look like an adventuring party fighting.

231
00:13:58,258 --> 00:13:59,642
Speaker 0: It's just progress quest.

232
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,347
Speaker 1: I mean, but there's plenty of idle games.

233
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:02,350
Speaker 1: They're all over at steam.

234
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:03,354
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't.

235
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:03,936
Speaker 0: quite a few.

236
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:07,710
Speaker 0: I would make physical high production value idle games.

237
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:09,175
Speaker 0: I'm actually slot machines.

238
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:10,580
Speaker 1: see you have a candy box.

239
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you only get more candy by putting money in.

240
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:14,734
Speaker 0: yeah It's a slot machine.

241
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:18,910
Speaker 0: it acts like it is the same payout odds over time as a slot machine.

242
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,180
Speaker 0: But the money you're putting in is basically just making the heroes be better.

243
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:26,130
Speaker 0: Uh-huh I feel like that is a did.

244
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,008
Speaker 1: Whether you win or lose the game is is there?

245
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:30,910
Speaker 1: your heroes are winning.

246
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:39,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, the heroes are always winning, but but you're losing money the whole time, but you could win them you might win Eventually you're gonna lose obviously.

247
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:42,869
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't know exactly how that's gonna work.

248
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:49,603
Speaker 0: I got an idea in my head actually so fun fact I actually met a dude who is like a game designer for casinos.

249
00:14:49,824 --> 00:15:02,647
Speaker 0: like dude is sounds like a scummy Dude head of a team that just designed slot machines straight up And he talked a lot about that Monopoly slot machine that we saw that one time meanwhile the fire emblem and also Animal Crossing mobile game.

250
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:09,728
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah They just got shut the fuck down down in Belgium because they're fucking gambling good and China's Seems like they're actually shutting down all the gambling games, too.

251
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:16,694
Speaker 0: So I don't want to go to do much deeper into the actual news, but unity Realized there was a problem.

252
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:32,770
Speaker 0: They deleted the tweet, and then they're really trying to back away from this and Based on your feedback where you moved a tweet and a blog post related to some upcoming 2019 features that are useful to craters They changed their framing to say real money game.

253
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,109
Speaker 1: So you basically just now you first you were like you admitted that you were going to.

254
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:49,029
Speaker 1: You wanted people who make slot machines to use unity and now you've admitted that the people who make you know iPhone games are basically making slot machines now in one hand.

255
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:51,870
Speaker 1: It's good because we all knew but now you've admitted even worse.

256
00:15:52,010 --> 00:16:01,263
Speaker 0: but it's good in one sense because it means that they recognize that uh Loot boxes are a bad look so they they're like.

257
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:05,483
Speaker 0: no no no we're just doing the unethical casinos We're not doing the unethical loot boxes.

258
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:06,409
Speaker 0: Don't worry about that.

259
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:17,030
Speaker 0: So we'll see how this all goes in the end because I Don't think unity is going to stop making features for casinos.

260
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:18,529
Speaker 1: Why would they yeah?

261
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:30,209
Speaker 0: I feel like that is going to be their bread and butter in the long run because the game industry is having a lot of problems monetizing and I feel like the casino industry is Really gonna push into this space as hard as possible.

262
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:34,159
Speaker 0: so we'll see where this all goes in the end.

263
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:37,827
Speaker 0: and In other news what do you got?

264
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:41,338
Speaker 1: so Uniqlo the the store the clothing store, right?

265
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:41,860
Speaker 0: I was just there.

266
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,211
Speaker 0: They got a good on Nintendo series.

267
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:43,837
Speaker 0: They got a really good.

268
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:45,845
Speaker 1: They upgrade other one.

269
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:46,608
Speaker 1: That's just a junior.

270
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:47,773
Speaker 1: I saw someone wearing it.

271
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:48,356
Speaker 0: I got that shirt.

272
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:48,898
Speaker 0: It's real good.

273
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:49,320
Speaker 1: You bought it.

274
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,400
Speaker 1: Okay, I was gonna tell you I saw someone wearing it and then of course you already bought.

275
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:54,788
Speaker 0: I also got a really good Bowser shirt.

276
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,719
Speaker 1: There's a boo shirt, but the lady who's your socks the ladies?

277
00:16:57,739 --> 00:16:58,060
Speaker 1: boo shirt.

278
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:00,213
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a. there's a man's version now if I saw it.

279
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:01,360
Speaker 1: It's just which one is it?

280
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,152
Speaker 0: It's the one where it's like it's a pocket shirt.

281
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:04,200
Speaker 1: No, not that one.

282
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:10,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem with the pocket shirt is that it looks good and the boo is good except they offset the boo.

283
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:15,704
Speaker 0: So he's like cut off on one side and then there's another like Opposite cut off boo on the other side.

284
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:20,760
Speaker 1: ladies shirt is a black shirt with white polka dots and some of the white dots are boos.

285
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:21,585
Speaker 0: Oh, I like that.

286
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:22,772
Speaker 0: Yes, you could pull that off.

287
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:23,739
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a lady sure.

288
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:25,960
Speaker 0: So I wear a lot of lady shirts anyway.

289
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,400
Speaker 0: A lot of my a lot of my t-shirts are actually fitted like women shirts anyway.

290
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:31,428
Speaker 1: So they had a contest.

291
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:34,600
Speaker 1: look up the shirt - you know for the Mario shirts, right?

292
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,307
Speaker 1: And now they had a contest for Pokemon shirts.

293
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,134
Speaker 1: people submitted their Pokemon shirt design.

294
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:39,600
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a different kind of lady's shirt.

295
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,508
Speaker 0: It's not a fitted lady's shirt.

296
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,295
Speaker 0: It's a. yeah, I can't pull this off.

297
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:44,440
Speaker 1: That's not the one.

298
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:47,599
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz this also looks good, but that's not the one.

299
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:56,140
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the People submitted their Pokemon t-shirt designs, right?

300
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:03,350
Speaker 1: And they chose some winners and the winner was sort of like this ancient style Gyrodos the three magic harps under it.

301
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,334
Speaker 1: kind of deal looks good.

302
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:04,736
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.

303
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:05,580
Speaker 1: it's not a bad design.

304
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,055
Speaker 1: It's not my favorite one, but it's a good one.

305
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:10,356
Speaker 1: You know, there was some other honorable mentions down under.

306
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:10,839
Speaker 1: I like better.

307
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:15,419
Speaker 1: There was like the one I like the most is a great wave with a bunch of magic carbs in it.

308
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:17,754
Speaker 1: Ooh, yeah, and there's also a Gengar one.

309
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:18,298
Speaker 1: That wasn't bad.

310
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:21,087
Speaker 1: Anyway, so it turns out.

311
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:23,994
Speaker 1: the person who made this shirt was it.

312
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:28,005
Speaker 1: they accused this person Li Wenpei of stealing the design.

313
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:37,437
Speaker 1: because they start people searched online and saw this design being used on lots of other things and They're like, hey this person just saw this design online and submitted it.

314
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:41,390
Speaker 1: That's a bunch of bullshit right now.

315
00:18:41,631 --> 00:18:43,938
Speaker 1: Normally that that would seem like a thing that normally happens.

316
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:44,620
Speaker 1: Yep, right?

317
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:54,409
Speaker 1: but actually Li Wenpei had an excuse so original that I believe it All right tracks.

318
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:04,444
Speaker 1: Li Wenpei's excuse was Yes, I put the design and made a few cell phone covers Before submitting it.

319
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:06,390
Speaker 1: He's like I made the design.

320
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:12,714
Speaker 1: I made some cell phone, you know cases with the design on it Before submitting it to the contest.

321
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:20,959
Speaker 1: I only made a few Right, and then some other people saw my design Ripped it off and made a bunch of other garbage.

322
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,993
Speaker 1: Right now they saw my cell phone cases.

323
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:25,520
Speaker 1: It's my design.

324
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:28,409
Speaker 1: Right, I believe that that's a like.

325
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,297
Speaker 1: you wouldn't say that if you were actually stole the design, right?

326
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:31,999
Speaker 1: That sounds legit.

327
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:46,036
Speaker 0: or That is a brilliant excuse in a copyright lax environment where it's very difficult to prove who actually originally designed it regardless Li Wenpei still up Schitt's Creek because Meanwhile him first place in the contest.

328
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:52,179
Speaker 1: Yeah The terms of the contest are you have not published this design anywhere ever before.

329
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:56,579
Speaker 1: Why?

330
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:00,509
Speaker 1: While making an excuse perhaps a true one.

331
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:01,010
Speaker 1: I believe it.

332
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:09,091
Speaker 1: Anyway - of saying no, I did not break rule 1 Breaking rule 2 so I think that's pretty hilarious.

333
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:10,916
Speaker 1: That's also part of why I believe it.

334
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:21,860
Speaker 0: Yeah Looks like he took that message down Yes, and and at the time of this article like a $10,000 payout for winning this thing, right?

335
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,455
Speaker 1: So we're gonna see what happens.

336
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:27,050
Speaker 0: Neither Uniqlo nor the Pokemon company will comment.

337
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see what.

338
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,924
Speaker 1: if this shirt ends up in the store or not It's gonna be interesting.

339
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:32,505
Speaker 0: Yep.

340
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:37,819
Speaker 0: Apparently the last news we have is that I think he said he's talking to Uniqlo.

341
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,260
Speaker 0: That's good.

342
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, that goes.

343
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:41,951
Speaker 1: I hope you can prove.

344
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,060
Speaker 0: you made the design so in some other news, there's some others review out.

345
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,099
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna link to this here.

346
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:55,200
Speaker 0: But as you know, I got an oculus rift and it's it's great But it's still like niche technology like it's still a heavy thing on the front of your face, which is fine.

347
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:56,328
Speaker 1: It's not it's not fun.

348
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,000
Speaker 0: I don't know why you're so down on it.

349
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,480
Speaker 1: I'm down on giant heavy thing on my face like the night.

350
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,240
Speaker 0: The only annoying thing about the oculus rift is that you do neck pain three now.

351
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:07,445
Speaker 0: You've never even worn it.

352
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:08,931
Speaker 0: you have no idea what it feels like.

353
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:11,020
Speaker 0: it doesn't in any way bother.

354
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,025
Speaker 1: How much does it weigh?

355
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:12,809
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

356
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:14,880
Speaker 1: you don't even notice it on a scale once you wear it.

357
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,387
Speaker 1: You don't even know more than my sunglasses.

358
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:18,356
Speaker 0: I mean, yes, that's too much.

359
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:27,060
Speaker 0: Okay Anyway, so the only annoying thing about the oculus is that it requires basically three sensors around the room.

360
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:31,386
Speaker 0: So I got a. you got to plug it into the computer to write that yeah But that doesn't get in the way either.

361
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:32,231
Speaker 1: Well, you got cables.

362
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:33,136
Speaker 1: You're stuck to a computer.

363
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:34,619
Speaker 1: You can't run around You can't do nothing.

364
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz that's what we need.

365
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:41,920
Speaker 0: that VR room scale or seated scale is already enough for a lot of really interesting experiences.

366
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:48,120
Speaker 0: Yeah The cable from the headset is actually not a problem like it never gets in the way Partly because most games are designed.

367
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:52,220
Speaker 1: Not convincing me a head cables not gonna get in the way.

368
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,650
Speaker 0: I don't know how your mouse cable gets in the way.

369
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,277
Speaker 0: I would never use a wireless mouse.

370
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,869
Speaker 0: Hey cables I do not use wireless things.

371
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:01,060
Speaker 1: generally even the longest cable in the world is no good.

372
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,509
Speaker 0: Also, you can buy a thing that'll make the oculus wireless.

373
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:04,232
Speaker 0: It's just expensive.

374
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:05,597
Speaker 1: It sounds like a bad idea.

375
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:07,389
Speaker 0: totally works It's just.

376
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,391
Speaker 0: it's basically wireless HDMI.

377
00:22:10,472 --> 00:22:13,263
Speaker 1: effectively Introduce lag them.

378
00:22:13,605 --> 00:22:14,930
Speaker 0: No, we're not noticeable leg.

379
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,400
Speaker 0: The only problem with it is it's very expensive.

380
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,927
Speaker 0: Okay, and it needs a lot of power.

381
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,632
Speaker 0: Is he gonna wear like a battery backpack?

382
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:22,494
Speaker 1: sounds dangerous.

383
00:22:22,936 --> 00:22:24,480
Speaker 0: Probably not dangerous just expensive.

384
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:26,205
Speaker 0: I don't think I will buy it.

385
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:33,359
Speaker 1: But anyway, I Gotta like yeah, like what the fuck is this a wiimote?

386
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,314
Speaker 0: I gotta put him in particular places.

387
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:37,880
Speaker 0: once they're set up It's fine.

388
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,954
Speaker 0: and because I mounted on the walls not really a problem.

389
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:46,647
Speaker 0: but it means Say I want to use the oculus in another room or I want to rearrange this room or do anything I gotta fudge with all that again.

390
00:22:46,707 --> 00:22:49,740
Speaker 1: is it interesting how the we needed that little sensor bar with like lights?

391
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,139
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't a sensor bar was just lights, but the switch does not need those.

392
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:58,080
Speaker 0: Well, the switch also depends on what you're doing.

393
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,554
Speaker 0: The switch does primarily accelerometer tracking which is extremely inaccurate for most use cases.

394
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:08,399
Speaker 1: saying you could play Wii bowling with a Switch, you know, whatever they call them.

395
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:16,640
Speaker 0: Yeah you could and it would be just fine partly because the Actual controls of that game are not that sensitive and kind of just make it work.

396
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,812
Speaker 1: But if you want to play it on the Wii, you got to have the lights.

397
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:20,139
Speaker 1: Yeah in the stick.

398
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:31,916
Speaker 0: so the RIT the oculus quest and the oculus rift s have now are now out and they are Basically version 2. so the existing oculus is gone and you can no longer buy it.

399
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:35,527
Speaker 0: and if you buy a regular oculus Yeah, it's the same size.

400
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:44,557
Speaker 0: All they've changed is that instead of Outside in tracking where the sensors are watching where you are and providing data.

401
00:23:44,577 --> 00:23:47,039
Speaker 1: They put cameras in it It has inside out tracking.

402
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:49,220
Speaker 0: Not really.

403
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:52,856
Speaker 0: so inside out tracking means that you don't need any external sensors.

404
00:23:53,379 --> 00:24:02,488
Speaker 0: the Headset itself will just use the environments to do the tracking and the hand Controllers are configured slightly differently.

405
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:06,460
Speaker 0: So the headset tracks the hands using that same technology.

406
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,489
Speaker 1: I'm not looking at my hands.

407
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,154
Speaker 1: I'm gonna look up.

408
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:08,780
Speaker 1: my hands are down.

409
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,314
Speaker 0: It still works for a lot of reasons that I don't want to get into because I'm so.

410
00:24:12,474 --> 00:24:20,039
Speaker 0: you don't seem to care and if I talk about any details, you'll probably just fall asleep, but it's highly effective and It looks pretty good.

411
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:31,672
Speaker 0: The only difference between the oculus s and the oculus quest is that the s is just like the current oculus you plug it Into a computer and then it can play any VR game.

412
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:36,260
Speaker 0: Okay with a slightly higher resolution But otherwise, it's pretty much the same experience.

413
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:41,720
Speaker 0: Just you don't need these sensors and the inside out tracking just makes everything a lot easier to set up.

414
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,559
Speaker 1: So basically there's no reason to buy the old one.

415
00:24:44,063 --> 00:24:46,060
Speaker 1: If you're gonna buy one you should buy this new one.

416
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,939
Speaker 1: Just better because you don't need shit around your room.

417
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,789
Speaker 0: But it's not that much better if you already have a good.

418
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,040
Speaker 1: not having shit around your room is I think significantly better.

419
00:24:55,241 --> 00:25:06,940
Speaker 0: So well still not good enough, but significantly better But because I already it is but because I already have it set up I would I if I upgrade all it would mean is I reclaim three USB three ports on my computer.

420
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,643
Speaker 1: I guess that's true.

421
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:09,933
Speaker 1: If you've already got the old one, it's not better enough.

422
00:25:09,993 --> 00:25:13,443
Speaker 1: It's sort of like iPhone 7s 7. you're good.

423
00:25:13,584 --> 00:25:16,332
Speaker 0: It's a slightly lower refresh rate, but not enough to matter.

424
00:25:16,393 --> 00:25:18,720
Speaker 0: but the resolution is higher but not that much higher.

425
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:21,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll see I might get it.

426
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,188
Speaker 1: What about the other one the oculus quest?

427
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:26,320
Speaker 0: actually you might be more interested in because the oculus quest?

428
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,171
Speaker 0: Just works without a computer at all.

429
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:30,592
Speaker 1: So it's a.

430
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,676
Speaker 0: it's just a headset.

431
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:32,780
Speaker 0: so they hand the controller.

432
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,950
Speaker 1: So they just put a phone inside the headset.

433
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,200
Speaker 0: They basically put everything you need in the headset.

434
00:25:37,423 --> 00:25:38,293
Speaker 1: So it's a. it's a phone.

435
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:43,140
Speaker 0: It's not just a phone though because there is a third oculus that's been out for a while the oculus go.

436
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:45,027
Speaker 0: That's basically just a phone.

437
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:50,234
Speaker 0: it can only play a curated limited set of games It's not so it's more powerful than a phone.

438
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:51,120
Speaker 0: oculus cool.

439
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:54,428
Speaker 1: So it's a laptop and a monitor strapped to your face.

440
00:25:54,609 --> 00:26:00,127
Speaker 0: oculus quest can play a shit ton of first-class games Like all the games.

441
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:01,778
Speaker 1: so it's a laptop strapped to your face.

442
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, how heavy is it with the chips in there?

443
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,236
Speaker 0: not that heavy like it's comfortable.

444
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,440
Speaker 1: it's got like a battery in there.

445
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,607
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of shit going on.

446
00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:11,191
Speaker 0: That's comfortable.

447
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:15,380
Speaker 0: It just works and It is probably going to push.

448
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:20,320
Speaker 0: I think the oculus quest based on all these reviews now that people are actually I mean at least you're not so it but it's not.

449
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,506
Speaker 1: You're not connected to anything.

450
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:21,988
Speaker 1: So that's huge.

451
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,220
Speaker 1: Well, it means it doesn't need shit around the room either.

452
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:26,160
Speaker 0: Uh, no because it's inside out track.

453
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:29,060
Speaker 1: So now they've only got one thing left to do which is make it not heaviest.

454
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,140
Speaker 0: But it can't play like weird indie games or games that need like a lot of horsepower.

455
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,164
Speaker 1: Well, that makes sense.

456
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:45,000
Speaker 0: You want to strap a 1080 your face, but it'll not lay Almost every game that matters right now and it's easy enough to use and a high quality of experience.

457
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:57,119
Speaker 0: This is the first VR headset that is likely to make the jump from a niche market to an extended market meaning Not everyone is gonna buy one of these but everyone who has some money and wants VR.

458
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:01,116
Speaker 0: This is accessible to a huge group of people.

459
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:07,536
Speaker 1: I think that Still may because it's still not there, but it's got the not there you're talking about.

460
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:08,700
Speaker 0: It's probably 20 years away.

461
00:27:08,822 --> 00:27:09,519
Speaker 1: Oh, then I don't give a shit.

462
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,689
Speaker 1: But the point is that is actually huge.

463
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:24,368
Speaker 1: for the thing that I see VR being used for the most which is kiosks demos All that kind of stuff is gonna be way better served With the oculus quest.

464
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:26,780
Speaker 1: that has the computer in it and no wires or nothing.

465
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,039
Speaker 1: Then the old school where you got a computer and a cable and shit in the room.

466
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:32,419
Speaker 0: But that's not what they're going for.

467
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,540
Speaker 1: I imagine if you're setting up a kiosk for your like demo whatever and which one are you gonna go with right?

468
00:27:39,202 --> 00:27:40,859
Speaker 0: Well, there are other VR headsets.

469
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,739
Speaker 0: There's that valve one that I'm not gonna touch with a 10-foot pole and I'm mad by it and try it out.

470
00:27:44,961 --> 00:27:53,080
Speaker 1: I think clearly that right now there is only what if you're gonna do a VR There is clearly a winner and some non winners, right?

471
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:59,570
Speaker 1: It's sort of a situation like back in the day where there was a Game Boy And then there was a Game Gear and a turbo graphics thing.

472
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:03,384
Speaker 1: and so the girl and it's like you look at those other ones And they're like, we're better.

473
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:04,107
Speaker 1: We got color.

474
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:04,589
Speaker 1: We're better.

475
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:09,912
Speaker 1: It's like clearly the Game Boy one is very well You know, I would argue the oculus is the Game Boy.

476
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:19,360
Speaker 0: I would argue the Game Gear Was superior except Sega did not foster a wide enough third-party network of games early enough for it.

477
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:22,126
Speaker 1: PSP was superior to uh-huh.

478
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:22,668
Speaker 1: Okay.

479
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:26,420
Speaker 0: The PSP's got some some points in his in his court.

480
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:32,320
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, the real tragedy in that era was the Sega Nomad was woefully under a Sega Nomad.

481
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,780
Speaker 1: It was not a. people don't know about this.

482
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,540
Speaker 1: Maybe the Sega Nomad was not a different console like the Game Boy.

483
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,964
Speaker 1: All right It was just a second.

484
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:42,796
Speaker 1: just a Sega Genesis that you could carry around with.

485
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:43,880
Speaker 1: it was kind of amazing.

486
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:52,572
Speaker 1: Like mostly you'd want to plug it into something into full-size Sega Genesis cartridge and shoved it in the top And it was just a screen and some batteries and a Genesis.

487
00:28:52,632 --> 00:28:53,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know who's?

488
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:54,780
Speaker 0: for you're at your grandma's house.

489
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:56,200
Speaker 0: You've got your Sega with you.

490
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:05,519
Speaker 1: It was literally just a portable television and a Sega Genesis in a plastic case where the cartridge slot on top Yep, and that was it and some battery holes.

491
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:18,440
Speaker 0: so if you were on them if you want like the nerd VR experience where you're gonna plug it into a computer and do The kind of stuff that I'm doing Get the oculus s. Yeah, it's gonna make it like four times easier.

492
00:29:19,043 --> 00:29:20,108
Speaker 0: You know how you set up the room.

493
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:25,979
Speaker 0: like now bit literally I got to stand in the middle of the room Take one of the handsets and like outline do a dance space.

494
00:29:26,457 --> 00:29:31,779
Speaker 0: No You outline the safe space and that way if your head or your hands get close the walls like up here in VR.

495
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:33,587
Speaker 0: So, you know where the walls are.

496
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:44,819
Speaker 0: you don't smack into them without riff with the rift s. You put it on and then it shows you the world Walking around through the cameras and you draw the safe space by just walking around your house.

497
00:29:45,523 --> 00:29:46,892
Speaker 0: Okay, and it just saves it.

498
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:50,092
Speaker 0: it's really cool Cables though.

499
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,079
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't need a computer.

500
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:54,785
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, you have a cable.

501
00:29:54,986 --> 00:29:59,646
Speaker 0: you walk around your room if it's a rift s. if the oculus go you just walk around Whatever space you're using.

502
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:09,306
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm probably gonna get this Just because I'd like to be able to set up the living room or this room depending on what I'm doing And that'd be really easy to do.

503
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:17,567
Speaker 0: Well, whereas now I'd have to move all three of these sensors So if any of our friends want a discounted Just as good but you have to do more.

504
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:19,334
Speaker 0: setup oculus rift.

505
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:23,460
Speaker 0: I've already had two of you ask I'll probably sell it to you at a discount because I'm just gonna upgrade.

506
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:36,463
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the day what he got, okay, so We live in the year 2019.

507
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:37,949
Speaker 0: I like I had to think about that for a second.

508
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:43,388
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we go to Rome in Italy There's some ancient biz there right?

509
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:46,316
Speaker 0: Yep, not as ancient as say Istanbul but still some ancient biz.

510
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:47,600
Speaker 1: there's like a calcium there.

511
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, you know, there's some good shit right old shit, but a lot of the most of the old shit ain't there anymore.

512
00:30:54,941 --> 00:31:00,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's been smashed replaced by modern buildings decayed Whatever.

513
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,648
Speaker 1: So you wonder right?

514
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:07,554
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you're standing in Rome anywhere in Rome You stand even let's say you're at a restaurant your pizza restaurant in Rome.

515
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,560
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's one there, right?

516
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:21,415
Speaker 1: Right eating some pizza in Rome in a sort of modern kitchen is there, you know, whatever where you are sitting Thousands of years ago in the times of the Caesars in that exact spot.

517
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:23,100
Speaker 1: There was something else there.

518
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:29,020
Speaker 1: There was like I don't know a bathhouse or a forum or a fucking you know peasants house.

519
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,153
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know some soldier house.

520
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:34,990
Speaker 1: It's a palace Something aqueduct right.

521
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:42,930
Speaker 1: there was something there no matter where you are in Rome There was some ancient Rome thing in that spot Right the same way that in the spot where you're standing right now.

522
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:44,957
Speaker 1: There was some Native American shit in this spot.

523
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:45,659
Speaker 1: Yep, right.

524
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:53,764
Speaker 1: So if you go to Rome, which you know is newer than you know that, you know Times of cavemen.

525
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:57,157
Speaker 1: It was actually civilization and interesting stuff right now.

526
00:31:57,177 --> 00:32:05,700
Speaker 1: Just like a tree Wouldn't it be cool to know exactly what was where right, you know, what was the layout of the old Rome?

527
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,744
Speaker 1: What buildings were there?

528
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:07,687
Speaker 1: Where were they?

529
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:08,269
Speaker 1: Right?

530
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,176
Speaker 1: What if you could walk around the old Rome?

531
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:13,701
Speaker 1: just you know Even though you're living in 2019?

532
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:18,277
Speaker 1: Well, it's a good thing that you live in 2019 because some Roman scholars at what's what school is this?

533
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:21,093
Speaker 1: it is Just scroll the top.

534
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:22,841
Speaker 0: Dr.

535
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:23,944
Speaker 0: Bernard Fisher, dr.

536
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:27,053
Speaker 1: Steven Zucker doesn't see what school they're from.

537
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:27,575
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

538
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:29,320
Speaker 1: it's on like a Smithsonian website, right?

539
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,405
Speaker 0: It's on smart history.org.

540
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:37,749
Speaker 1: Okay, whatever the point is these professors from school that we forget the the name of Forget.

541
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:38,578
Speaker 0: we didn't know it.

542
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:47,832
Speaker 1: they created a complete Computer, it's not like the highest quality like video game graphics, right?

543
00:32:48,113 --> 00:32:50,379
Speaker 1: It looks more like AutoCAD from the 90s.

544
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

545
00:32:51,944 --> 00:32:54,553
Speaker 0: It looks like a missed knockoff game.

546
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:58,607
Speaker 1: Yes, but it's Completely accurate.

547
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:07,508
Speaker 1: as for to the extent of human knowledge CG 3d replica of Ancient Rome you can fly around look around walk around.

548
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,594
Speaker 0: I really want to walk around this in VR.

549
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:12,789
Speaker 1: You can see exactly where stuff was Right.

550
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:13,820
Speaker 1: What was where?

551
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,744
Speaker 1: What things looked like?

552
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:17,810
Speaker 1: they got some fake people walking around.

553
00:33:17,851 --> 00:33:20,840
Speaker 1: you can see the sizes of things which is really important.

554
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,839
Speaker 1: Right how big was shit, right?

555
00:33:24,221 --> 00:33:33,820
Speaker 1: And you this video that is on the page that I'm linking to is extra great because not only Do you get to they fly around Rome?

556
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:49,083
Speaker 1: But they tell you about all this stuff as if you were in a helicopter getting a free tour of Rome from some extra Knowledgeable people saying like oh, yeah That is the thing that was made for Emperor so-and-so to celebrate the victory in such and such a place You know.

557
00:33:49,124 --> 00:33:53,280
Speaker 1: and that was an arch made for this a reason and that was a public bathhouse.

558
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:54,986
Speaker 1: And that was a public bathhouse.

559
00:33:55,247 --> 00:34:00,443
Speaker 1: and this area is where Nero built a bunch of shit and the later Emperor's Un-neuroed it.

560
00:34:00,825 --> 00:34:04,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're like, yeah see that statue that used to be a Nero statue.

561
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:07,314
Speaker 1: Then they chopped its head off and put a godhead on it instead.

562
00:34:07,535 --> 00:34:11,130
Speaker 1: because fuck Nero So there's a lot of good you're like.

563
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,340
Speaker 1: this is the circus Maximus.

564
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:21,580
Speaker 1: You can see this is where the the Caesars Palace connects directly to the circus the box Right, so you can walk from the inside of his palace to his box to see the chariot race.

565
00:34:22,905 --> 00:34:27,100
Speaker 0: If you go to the Istanbul, you can actually walk through some of those things because a lot more of that is still there.

566
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:29,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're like, oh, yeah See, this is where the circus Maximus.

567
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:36,572
Speaker 1: this is a picture of where the circus Maximus was today And it's like a field with some obvious sort of run down.

568
00:34:36,853 --> 00:34:41,188
Speaker 0: and circus Maximus is like plus five Global happiness and said five.

569
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,678
Speaker 1: Oh, look at your memory knowledge base games bringing it back.

570
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:48,391
Speaker 0: So My video.

571
00:34:48,532 --> 00:34:49,500
Speaker 0: this was making the rounds.

572
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:52,130
Speaker 0: It's not a GDQ, but it's an adjacent event.

573
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:54,280
Speaker 0: and yet the video explains it all in detail.

574
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,246
Speaker 0: This is a test bot run.

575
00:34:56,328 --> 00:35:02,833
Speaker 0: So it's a tool assisted Final Fantasy one speed run For white mages for white mages.

576
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:03,757
Speaker 1: How do you do any damage?

577
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,786
Speaker 1: Ah Like you get amazing.

578
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:11,129
Speaker 1: you could hold out a really long time by constantly healing yourself But you'd be doing such low DPS.

579
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,880
Speaker 1: So every combat would take forever once they got hard.

580
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:15,584
Speaker 0: So one.

581
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:24,952
Speaker 0: this belies your knowledge of Final Fantasy because Final Fantasy one white mages can do some fucking hella Damage, well, it's the guys that are weak to healing you can bad guys.

582
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:25,775
Speaker 1: You can heal the dam.

583
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:28,496
Speaker 0: Scott Thor's hammer mage staff.

584
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:30,429
Speaker 1: Any of these ring a bell?

585
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,099
Speaker 0: No, really Zeus gauntlet.

586
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,467
Speaker 1: Look at rim with the knowledge base games again.

587
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:38,580
Speaker 0: You realize in Final Fantasy one the white mages wielded hammers.

588
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:43,700
Speaker 0: Yeah hammers do fucking damage, okay also a lot of the hammers.

589
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:45,540
Speaker 1: Why are the three white dead white mages though?

590
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,036
Speaker 0: Because he only does that he kills three of them right away and does the whole run.

591
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:49,860
Speaker 0: was just one white mage.

592
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:50,662
Speaker 1: What the?

593
00:35:50,722 --> 00:35:54,013
Speaker 0: because it's faster that way because frame timing.

594
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:56,340
Speaker 0: This is a tool assisted run.

595
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:59,268
Speaker 0: Okay, wait, but here's why this is my thing of the day.

596
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,240
Speaker 0: It's not just an emulator tool assisted run or anything like that.

597
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:13,113
Speaker 0: This is a tool assisted run being played back by Taz bot on an actual physical fucking cartridge such as my works Yes, and has to stay in sync or else it gets said.

598
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:13,836
Speaker 0: Yep.

599
00:36:14,097 --> 00:36:19,315
Speaker 0: Once they get it started They're like nobody walked near this one static shock and that cable will ruin the entire run.

600
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:24,862
Speaker 0: That's right, but to the commentary is a Plus.

601
00:36:25,364 --> 00:36:30,820
Speaker 0: the commentary talks about tool assisted runs about Final Fantasy about how they pulled this off.

602
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:33,380
Speaker 0: How they beat chaos at the end is amazing.

603
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:37,652
Speaker 0: I knew the chaos trick, but this one actually they use the trick.

604
00:36:38,134 --> 00:36:39,559
Speaker 0: which trick do you which trick you thinking of?

605
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,748
Speaker 1: I'm not thinking of a trick.

606
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:41,679
Speaker 1: I'm just saying they use the trick.

607
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:45,039
Speaker 0: There's multiple ways to kill chaos kind of instantly that are really funny.

608
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:46,102
Speaker 0: They do.

609
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:51,197
Speaker 0: one of the myriad ways to ruin chaos actually do legit just fight.

610
00:36:51,438 --> 00:36:52,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not as fight.

611
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:55,627
Speaker 0: They get chaos to run away from the fight.

612
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:56,108
Speaker 0: So they win.

613
00:36:56,128 --> 00:36:59,360
Speaker 0: Okay, you can get chaos to run away by using a certain spell.

614
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:01,758
Speaker 1: Okay, it's pretty good I should do that.

615
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,589
Speaker 1: No I can play.

616
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:09,563
Speaker 0: and then Anyway, if the bad part is this kind of made me want to play Final Fantasy 1 again have a lot of nostalgia for this Game.

617
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:10,170
Speaker 0: I go for it.

618
00:37:10,392 --> 00:37:16,213
Speaker 1: I might Play the Final Fantasy 3 real Final Fantasy 3.

619
00:37:16,213 --> 00:37:17,457
Speaker 0: I've played it a bad one.

620
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:18,060
Speaker 0: I played it.

621
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:19,874
Speaker 0: I didn't beat it, but I got pretty far.

622
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:21,923
Speaker 0: I also played fun Jobs and stuff.

623
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:24,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, I played Final Fantasy 2 most of the way.

624
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:26,080
Speaker 1: I'll play that piece of garbage game.

625
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:27,419
Speaker 0: I've played those games.

626
00:37:27,961 --> 00:37:30,327
Speaker 0: That's what actually my favorite or I like.

627
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:31,671
Speaker 0: RPG speed runs in general.

628
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:37,224
Speaker 0: My favorite one ever is still Final Fantasy legend 2 At a GDQ.

629
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:39,651
Speaker 0: That's a real fun one in the moment.

630
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:42,580
Speaker 0: The book club book is the painful pages of pain by Troy Denning.

631
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:46,234
Speaker 1: I'm almost 80% done, but I haven't read in like a week because I'm not.

632
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:47,880
Speaker 1: I'm not riding trains anymore.

633
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:52,560
Speaker 0: I'm in about the same spot because I stopped reading at the same point Scott did when it got sunny out.

634
00:37:54,345 --> 00:38:00,420
Speaker 0: At least now I'm not saying good or bad But I think you have hit the point in the book where it goes off the rails.

635
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:04,920
Speaker 1: It's been off the rails pretty much the whole time, but it goes further and further off.

636
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:11,660
Speaker 0: It's like oh the whole books gonna be in these mazes - Oh people just swapping limbs foot for a leg.

637
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck it.

638
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:12,964
Speaker 0: Let's go.

639
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:13,807
Speaker 0: Let's roll.

640
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:15,694
Speaker 1: I already saw the foot for a leg.

641
00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:16,216
Speaker 0: Yep.

642
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:17,480
Speaker 1: Oh that hand for a foot.

643
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:22,446
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah the hand for a foot Carfoot the best goddamn character.

644
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:24,572
Speaker 0: I love car foot that dude.

645
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:26,999
Speaker 0: You don't even know the full extent of his depredations.

646
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:35,644
Speaker 0: yet The book goes surreal and off the rails and that is why I remember this book being different from every other Dungeons & Dragons book.

647
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:40,360
Speaker 0: every other D&D book is just fantasy novel happens, and then it stops happening.

648
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:43,228
Speaker 0: This one is like here's some fucked up shit.

649
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:47,679
Speaker 0: That's actually kind of disturbing and we're not even at the tip of the iceberg yet, okay?

650
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,935
Speaker 0: Dear I wonder what you're gonna think about the ending now that we're in the trippy shit.

651
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:52,860
Speaker 1: Well I have to find out.

652
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:54,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not even gonna spoil where it goes.

653
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:55,654
Speaker 0: I'm curious though.

654
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:56,820
Speaker 0: What do you think's gonna happen?

655
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,780
Speaker 0: Do you think anyone makes it out of the mazes?

656
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:06,020
Speaker 1: You know usually when I read or interact in any story in any medium right I can definitely think what's gonna happen.

657
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:15,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Wheel of Time book one You know the final confrontation is gonna be the main dude who becomes the old dragon dude But like it's the other dude for this one.

658
00:39:15,472 --> 00:39:20,070
Speaker 1: I honestly have no Like like no idea at all.

659
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,420
Speaker 1: like of any you know I guess the most likely thing to happen.

660
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:30,650
Speaker 0: I'm really curious cuz I Having read it twice when I was young The ending all around when it ended.

661
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:34,605
Speaker 0: I thought all I could think was wow So I can only sort of like.

662
00:39:34,646 --> 00:39:46,200
Speaker 1: I can't you know pinpoint exactly what's gonna happen, but I can say you know things turn out well for Lady of pain yeah, maybe demon dude things turn out poorly.

663
00:39:47,003 --> 00:39:50,760
Speaker 1: Everyone else yeah, and beside that's all I can say that's all much.

664
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,462
Speaker 1: That's the only.

665
00:39:51,603 --> 00:39:53,931
Speaker 1: that's as close as to guessing what will happen as I can get.

666
00:39:54,292 --> 00:40:00,197
Speaker 1: I just imagine like the real Which characters get things turn out good and which things turn.

667
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:00,880
Speaker 0: the only thing?

668
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,499
Speaker 0: I regret is that this book needed an epilogue and the epilogue literally should have just been.

669
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,480
Speaker 1: Poseidon gets but he's angry.

670
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:20,979
Speaker 0: Two options either Poseidon is just in his temple sitting on his throne Something like ah shit didn't work no, and then he just thinks to himself wonder whatever happened to that threson guy.

671
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:28,040
Speaker 0: Or option B the lady of pain shows up in his house and fucking stabs, how can she get there?

672
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,809
Speaker 0: I don't read your book.

673
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,019
Speaker 1: I don't think she can get there.

674
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:38,079
Speaker 0: uh I would say that things cannot turn out well for the lady of pain because Well for the lady of pain still sucks for the lady of pain.

675
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:44,822
Speaker 0: I Guess this book is canon though, so I guess this is the lady of pains deal Is it?

676
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:49,255
Speaker 1: I guess isn't only the things in like like D&D book.

677
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:50,800
Speaker 1: What's a branded D&D book book?

678
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,707
Speaker 1: No, I mean like you know game books.

679
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

680
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:57,410
Speaker 0: I'm gonna Spate this for you a book club show.

681
00:40:57,652 --> 00:40:58,558
Speaker 0: anyway two player games.

682
00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:00,928
Speaker 1: All right, this was my idea.

683
00:41:00,948 --> 00:41:03,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, so oh I got a thing up here.

684
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,013
Speaker 0: Let me pull up a two player games, so we've done talks about this before.

685
00:41:07,053 --> 00:41:15,847
Speaker 0: like we bring this up whenever we talk about board games We'll start with board games like into video games, but two player games Are a very like interesting into.

686
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:19,959
Speaker 0: well, I guess two player games are like a unique difficult and interesting space.

687
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:27,980
Speaker 0: Three player games are their own like hellish can of worms and then end player games are like normal games.

688
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's weird right.

689
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:32,340
Speaker 1: so for mathematically speaking right?

690
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,369
Speaker 1: It's like there's one player no player.

691
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:42,008
Speaker 1: three player and anything bigger than three is Effectively sort of mathematically similar.

692
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:46,139
Speaker 1: it becomes like they're like they're like three is a little bit political right.

693
00:41:46,159 --> 00:42:00,679
Speaker 0: well I'd say three is Political, but three is special because three is hyper political in the sense of almost any three player game That is not a race or solitaire ends up being one player gets fucked and the other two players play the game right.

694
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:04,470
Speaker 1: it ends Up being basically a to a political game that becomes a two player game.

695
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:09,508
Speaker 1: Yep, anything instantly anything more than three is Normal political game.

696
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:11,200
Speaker 1: doesn't matter four or five six a hundred.

697
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,840
Speaker 1: There's article games right and then a two player game is a two player game and a one player game is a puzzle.

698
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:27,717
Speaker 0: Yep, but a two player game is interesting because let's talk about just board games You can't really make them have staying power unless you make them go or chess.

699
00:42:28,098 --> 00:42:28,700
Speaker 1: yeah, so right.

700
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,932
Speaker 1: So there's basically the two player games available are coin toss.

701
00:42:33,113 --> 00:42:35,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, we randomly decide who wins right?

702
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:42,182
Speaker 1: Rock paper scissor, it's we we decide things their decisions, but it is literally arbitrary.

703
00:42:42,282 --> 00:42:53,460
Speaker 0: winner is arbitrary though it is theoretically possible as we know from that bot to Figure out someone else's poor decision-making in those completely arbitrary.

704
00:42:54,165 --> 00:42:56,160
Speaker 1: But that's an edge case right anyway.

705
00:42:57,302 --> 00:43:07,903
Speaker 1: And then most two player games right you know accounting for all the other factors right perfect information Or not or random or not They end up.

706
00:43:08,144 --> 00:43:11,314
Speaker 1: You know since you're always acting in your best interest.

707
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:13,440
Speaker 1: You're just always making the optimal move every turn.

708
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,082
Speaker 1: That's all you're doing.

709
00:43:14,102 --> 00:43:15,447
Speaker 1: There's no reason to do anything else.

710
00:43:15,949 --> 00:43:19,240
Speaker 1: There's no third players or things to consider right?

711
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,440
Speaker 1: You're just trying to make your optimal move and your opponent is trying to make their optimal move.

712
00:43:24,326 --> 00:43:27,324
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter it ends up being tic-tac-toe Right.

713
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:33,327
Speaker 1: the only difference is that you make it more complex than tic-tac-toe And it's no longer obvious what the turn should be.

714
00:43:33,688 --> 00:43:38,001
Speaker 1: so it ends up being who is better at solving this puzzle against this other Person.

715
00:43:38,162 --> 00:43:50,250
Speaker 0: yep, but that's where it gets weird because two-player games like you know Emily I live together and our friends Chris and Anthony like we have a lot of friends who there are two people who want to play games in the Western society tend to live in twos.

716
00:43:50,430 --> 00:44:02,411
Speaker 0: yep, so if you get a two-player game and You play it like you would often because there's two of you You're gonna do the thing to that game as fast as possible.

717
00:44:02,712 --> 00:44:05,540
Speaker 0: that Scott and I and the front row crew do to every game.

718
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:10,240
Speaker 0: You play it enough times to where you completely solve it and ruin it and have no reason never play it again.

719
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:11,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I've played.

720
00:44:11,827 --> 00:44:20,978
Speaker 1: you know what two-player patchwork like a whole bunch of times It's like well now I pretty much you know whether I win or lose just comes down to the order of the tiles and who goes first.

721
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,610
Speaker 0: yep So like a town is a good example.

722
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:25,178
Speaker 0: It's a game that we reviewed a while ago.

723
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:25,580
Speaker 0: Good game.

724
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,497
Speaker 0: It's a real good game two-player game.

725
00:44:28,801 --> 00:44:36,311
Speaker 0: But German board game feel like it's a pretty complex two-player game and Completely fair and completely symmetric.

726
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:50,500
Speaker 0: and yet even in this situation Scott and I played it against each other like five times five or six times and By the sixth time we were literally making the exact same decisions based on our hands.

727
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:53,569
Speaker 0: No matter what the game was always a perfect tie.

728
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,816
Speaker 0: everything came down to tiebreakers.

729
00:44:56,137 --> 00:44:57,240
Speaker 0: tiebreakers upon tiebreakers.

730
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:02,740
Speaker 0: Like the game just lost all meaning and replayability.

731
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:06,144
Speaker 0: within six plays You can.

732
00:45:06,184 --> 00:45:11,659
Speaker 0: it's very difficult to make a two-player game that doesn't have that happen unless it is just chess or go right.

733
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:12,585
Speaker 1: well So right.

734
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:19,739
Speaker 1: so I mean when rim says just chess or go he just means it's so complex that you can't possibly right make out some more moves because they just so.

735
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:24,260
Speaker 0: the Decision space is just enormous and it's right and then way if you make a game like that.

736
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,928
Speaker 0: There's only two ways to go with that big decision space either.

737
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,276
Speaker 0: The game is over complicated.

738
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:30,560
Speaker 1: the Duke is big big decision.

739
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:38,210
Speaker 0: Yes, right, but it could be over complicated in a non fun way like Twilight Struggle where the complication just slows down actual play.

740
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:49,699
Speaker 0: complicated in a fun way like the Duke yep, or You can just make it entirely abstract like go and then the heuristics become Abstract heuristics that you have to develop independently, right?

741
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:53,050
Speaker 1: This is other ways to make interesting two-player games, right.

742
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:58,048
Speaker 1: so you can include some sort of dexterity element Yeah, or some sort of a sport element.

743
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,920
Speaker 0: That's why two-player video games are really easy to make right?

744
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,260
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know any fighting game, but also like sports, right?

745
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,832
Speaker 1: It's like I you know, you could do just a race you can do boxing.

746
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:08,053
Speaker 0: Yep.

747
00:46:08,154 --> 00:46:09,940
Speaker 0: One-on-one basketball is super fun, right?

748
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,484
Speaker 1: It's all.

749
00:46:10,585 --> 00:46:21,060
Speaker 1: once you incorporate some sort of other measurable Analog ability suddenly a two-player competition that isn't just numbers is now more meaningful and interesting.

750
00:46:21,221 --> 00:46:24,960
Speaker 1: Also, you can make a game even if it is a boring game, you know.

751
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,680
Speaker 1: Like tic-tac-toe you could just do two teams because two team game is effectively the same as a two-player game.

752
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:37,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there's no politics and the main reason people seek these two-player games with teams is to avoid politics.

753
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:43,145
Speaker 0: So the it's a pure test of skill as opposed to well Everybody banged up on rim.

754
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:52,754
Speaker 1: in round one you get the benefit of eliminating politics, but you get the also the benefit of Cooperating with another person and having the game, you know be more meaningful.

755
00:46:52,774 --> 00:46:54,580
Speaker 1: So the the best example of that is bridge.

756
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:55,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

757
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:57,800
Speaker 1: So bridge is a two team game, right?

758
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,360
Speaker 1: You can't communicate with the other person, but you still have the fun of playing with someone.

759
00:47:02,601 --> 00:47:05,611
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Euchre does the same thing, right, but you're still.

760
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:08,320
Speaker 1: you know, see yeah, you get the idea.

761
00:47:08,721 --> 00:47:10,385
Speaker 0: So it's interesting.

762
00:47:10,405 --> 00:47:30,557
Speaker 0: the like a lot like a ton is the kind of German board game that if a game like that like you play one a similar game that has more than two players the game ends up having a lot more replayability and a lot more difficulty in reaching that solution largely because of the politics and the unpredictability of the other players.

763
00:47:30,898 --> 00:47:48,680
Speaker 0: like Four people will take longer to converge on set strategies in a game than two players Because the like there's more total possibility of what other people might do Even if you ignore the cut the possibility that those people will do stupid things like when our group of friends plays Tigger's New Freighties.

764
00:47:49,582 --> 00:47:55,720
Speaker 0: Even though we should have solved this game the game ends up still being a very fulfilling experience.

765
00:47:56,062 --> 00:48:00,047
Speaker 0: But if Tigger's New Freighties were somehow a two-player game I know the rules.

766
00:48:00,107 --> 00:48:02,460
Speaker 0: like one of the printings actually says you can play a two-player.

767
00:48:03,043 --> 00:48:06,320
Speaker 0: It is deeply unsatisfying and no fun things happen at any point.

768
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:18,448
Speaker 1: There's lots and lots of games that are n-plus player games and the instructions either say yeah You can play two-player probably just to increase sales to people who only have one friend or they have special rules Like if you're playing two-player do this.

769
00:48:18,468 --> 00:48:20,480
Speaker 0: Like Hansa Toytotica has a two-player variant.

770
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,710
Speaker 0: It's garbage, but it adds this extra crap and you can just.

771
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:34,446
Speaker 1: those are a great illustration though of how Significantly different a two-player game is from any other number of game and just how different again It's like a completely different.

772
00:48:34,467 --> 00:48:42,499
Speaker 1: you take the same game in the same box almost the same rules You just go down to two players and suddenly it's nothing like what it is when there's three or four plus players.

773
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:45,568
Speaker 0: Yep So the game that seems the two-player game.

774
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:53,740
Speaker 0: that is not a video game not a sport as no dexterity component That seems to like seems like it's gonna have the most staying power.

775
00:48:54,561 --> 00:48:56,467
Speaker 0: Might actually be Fox in the Forest.

776
00:48:57,029 --> 00:48:57,250
Speaker 1: Hmm.

777
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,875
Speaker 0: It's okay cuz family I've been playing it.

778
00:48:58,955 --> 00:49:11,653
Speaker 0: So I've been thinking about it a lot and The nature of the way its rules are written or why it's the case because it ends up focusing on Card counting and bluffing with just enough randomness.

779
00:49:12,135 --> 00:49:16,700
Speaker 0: We've reviewed the game not gonna get to the mechanics But the fact that you're not just trying to get the most tricks.

780
00:49:17,202 --> 00:49:23,785
Speaker 1: You're trying to get the right number of tricks because if you get right, there's an odd number of tricks So you can't tie.

781
00:49:23,865 --> 00:49:26,093
Speaker 1: it's impossible even though it's two players.

782
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:26,715
Speaker 1: That's the first.

783
00:49:26,835 --> 00:49:28,200
Speaker 1: that's the first genius mechanic.

784
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,931
Speaker 1: Right is like, alright, you're gonna play a game.

785
00:49:31,112 --> 00:49:32,136
Speaker 1: They're what?

786
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:41,340
Speaker 1: 13 points, I guess Yeah, so if you have two players and all the points will be scored then Someone's gonna have more than the other person and you're trying to get more.

787
00:49:41,822 --> 00:49:46,100
Speaker 0: But if you take too many you get no points and the other person gets a ton of points.

788
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:53,459
Speaker 0: Yep so Emily when we were playing actually the other day Emily completely wrecked me on that because I had a pretty good hand and I Thought I can probably take enough.

789
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:59,179
Speaker 0: So I took a bunch of tricks really early to like set myself and then I thought I could just like throw the rest away And be fine.

790
00:50:00,443 --> 00:50:01,148
Speaker 0: It was a trap.

791
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:16,840
Speaker 0: I ended up taking every trick And that give-and-take like that Mechanic alone makes Fox in the forest like really powerful and has a lot of staying power Because you can bluff in a two-player game without politics.

792
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:24,123
Speaker 0: and then the fact that the cards give you abilities to rotate Trump and to like influence the play space and So the game.

793
00:50:24,143 --> 00:50:33,645
Speaker 0: you even looking at your hand, like I go I play wizard and I got a hand I can have a pretty good heuristic as to what tricks I could take or not take and Managing the politics of the table.

794
00:50:34,087 --> 00:50:40,694
Speaker 0: in a two-player game where Trump can change based on actions It's a lot harder to have that set strategy.

795
00:50:41,075 --> 00:50:47,880
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I'm trying to get other games that seem like they are like avoiding the this two-player game problem.

796
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,180
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know longer patchwork is maybe one of the best two-player games.

797
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:56,489
Speaker 1: There is yep, but you know its main Replayability is due to the randomness of the order.

798
00:50:56,549 --> 00:50:57,673
Speaker 1: the tiles come out, right?

799
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,447
Speaker 1: So it You know that I don't know.

800
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:11,400
Speaker 1: Well the other two-player games that I think have survived definitely I think what it is is that with the with patchwork if you're pro You're gonna sort of play it out faster.

801
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:16,392
Speaker 1: I think for a lot of people they would just never play patchwork out and just love it forever Even if they played it a ton.

802
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:24,485
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, like spring meadow and games that are races games that are more like I am trying to do my solitaire Oh, you're doing the solitaire.

803
00:51:24,787 --> 00:51:27,400
Speaker 0: two player is not different than three player or four player.

804
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:29,328
Speaker 0: So I guess those all sort of get a pass.

805
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:31,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a Yahtzee you can play Yahtzee two-player like.

806
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:32,360
Speaker 1: what's the point?

807
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they're all effectively one player like you don't interact with each other in any meaningful way, right?

808
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:41,160
Speaker 1: But actually if you played say that's pretty clever Ganshin clever.

809
00:51:41,381 --> 00:51:53,760
Speaker 1: it matters a lot to player that you know actually is pretty interesting because Now, you know, it's not actually a polyp There's no politics in it because you can't really you know vote for the other players in any meaningful way.

810
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:56,660
Speaker 1: But your actions do affect the other players.

811
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,339
Speaker 1: But when there's a lot of players, it's hard to pay attention all of them.

812
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:02,960
Speaker 1: But with only one person to pay attention to you can focus and back.

813
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,487
Speaker 1: I what did they need and deny them.

814
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:10,000
Speaker 1: so it takes less brainpower to get to the advanced level, right?

815
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,462
Speaker 1: It's not like.

816
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,587
Speaker 1: it's actually a different game.

817
00:52:11,607 --> 00:52:17,155
Speaker 1: It's just you can access the higher game If your brain is weaker or put in less effort,

818
00:52:17,276 --> 00:52:26,406
Speaker 0: yeah One thing I've noticed too with two-player games is that if you have a two-player game and play it a bunch it's very hard to play it with

819
00:52:26,968 --> 00:52:27,409
Speaker 1: anyone

820
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:37,560
Speaker 0: other than the person you've been playing it with or Someone else who has also played it a lot Like if I bust out a town against like the world born.

821
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:46,459
Speaker 0: I played it a bunch of times they haven't and because it's two-player and there's no politics and there's very little randomness I will just win no matter what.

822
00:52:47,402 --> 00:52:49,091
Speaker 0: At least the first time I play with anyone.

823
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:55,400
Speaker 0: so unless you pull your punches Once you start playing a two-player game, you're kind of locked in to the people who have played at the same number of times.

824
00:52:55,886 --> 00:53:00,211
Speaker 1: I know this same thing Whenever I play someone in hive for the first time.

825
00:53:00,232 --> 00:53:01,135
Speaker 0: Oh my god, you pull out.

826
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:02,620
Speaker 0: you pull out the spider or the beetle.

827
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,965
Speaker 1: I just say look.

828
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:05,249
Speaker 1: I've played this game you haven't.

829
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,714
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do the beetle.

830
00:53:07,136 --> 00:53:08,320
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do the beetle attack.

831
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,656
Speaker 1: yep, and I'm gonna and you're gonna lose probably if you don't.

832
00:53:11,776 --> 00:53:12,319
Speaker 1: that's awesome.

833
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:18,320
Speaker 1: and Then after you lose you're gonna play again and I'm gonna keep doing the beetle attack every single game.

834
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,999
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do the same beetle attack until you don't lose to it.

835
00:53:21,422 --> 00:53:26,988
Speaker 1: Once you once you manage to not lose to the beetle attack Then we you figure that out.

836
00:53:27,168 --> 00:53:28,673
Speaker 0: then I'm gonna do the tricky spider.

837
00:53:28,693 --> 00:53:30,418
Speaker 1: No, then we're ready to play real hive.

838
00:53:30,558 --> 00:53:34,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, right When you don't just get dominated by the beetle, I'm just.

839
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:36,080
Speaker 0: I'm really thinking about this now.

840
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:49,880
Speaker 0: I feel like there's the core of a panel here like a one on Specific like all these specific reasons why two-player and three-player are So different from all other numbers of players like in detail with a lot of examples.

841
00:53:49,940 --> 00:54:00,620
Speaker 1: Well, the other the other Savior of the two-player game is of course, you know, the customizable game like imagine Netrunner or a miniatures game right where you choose your stuff, right?

842
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:06,900
Speaker 0: And that brings in that aspect of like two-player battle tech super fun brings the max and just fight it out, right?

843
00:54:07,384 --> 00:54:12,631
Speaker 1: All those games you have this customized asymmetric asymmetric start it.

844
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:15,240
Speaker 1: that is what makes a lot of two-player games work.

845
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:22,140
Speaker 1: Well, because no matter how much you've mastered the game every single game you're venturing into the unknown, right?

846
00:54:22,642 --> 00:54:29,056
Speaker 1: So like I said patchwork Randomizes the shared play space right like the board and I think you know more.

847
00:54:29,357 --> 00:54:30,420
Speaker 1: a lot of games do do that.

848
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:34,345
Speaker 1: But I think more games need to do it more Randomizing the shared space.

849
00:54:34,686 --> 00:54:38,160
Speaker 1: but when you can bring whatever you want the other person can bring whatever they want.

850
00:54:38,504 --> 00:54:39,700
Speaker 1: All right, it's like rock-paper-scissors.

851
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:43,920
Speaker 1: Sometimes it is does just come down to rock-paper-scissors like oh my deck just beats your deck.

852
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,944
Speaker 0: Why don't you get that?

853
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:46,069
Speaker 0: but we talked about that.

854
00:54:46,089 --> 00:54:48,840
Speaker 0: other show the expression like you get to express yourself, right?

855
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,003
Speaker 0: But they have an experience.

856
00:54:50,044 --> 00:54:58,768
Speaker 1: but you if it's it's rock-paper-scissors, but then if it's not just an imbalanced Oh my I have a deck that counters yours I win if it actually is like.

857
00:54:58,788 --> 00:55:01,020
Speaker 1: oh we have like a 50/50 chance of winning here with these.

858
00:55:01,262 --> 00:55:02,777
Speaker 1: You know this combination, right?

859
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:10,980
Speaker 1: Then you have the added thing of the playing right and it's like a new thing like super new thing every single time.

860
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:18,804
Speaker 1: Plus if it's a card game, you've got the added randomness of shuffling your deck and you don't have to worry about Managers.

861
00:55:18,824 --> 00:55:20,859
Speaker 1: game does not as the only randomness of the dice

862
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:40,640
Speaker 0: like you play magic or anything else where you're like any one of these like broader games with end players outside as opposed to like a Two-player customizable or semi customizable game locally You only have to worry about the local meta like the meta between you and your friends as Opposed to a broader meta with more friends or broader meta with a tournament scene.

863
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:43,500
Speaker 1: Well, the internet really, you know changed that a whole lot, right?

864
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,180
Speaker 1: I mean on my early magic days I had like a book that held all these decks in it.

865
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,465
Speaker 0: I think I had that same book.

866
00:55:48,485 --> 00:55:49,369
Speaker 1: It's like an orange book.

867
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:52,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I wanted to afford to make most of those decks.

868
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:54,180
Speaker 1: It's like I didn't see any of those cards ever.

869
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,059
Speaker 1: I'm like, well, I guess I can't do any of this.

870
00:55:56,302 --> 00:56:00,829
Speaker 0: One of the decks was like yo, dude You get some of this like serpent generator.

871
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,780
Speaker 0: make some poison and fucking poison the shit out of the other person.

872
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,947
Speaker 0: I was like serpent generator.

873
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:05,932
Speaker 0: What set is that?

874
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:07,200
Speaker 1: even from the point is?

875
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,355
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the point and that book was out of date by the time I got it.

876
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:11,200
Speaker 1: cuz new cards have been printed.

877
00:56:12,861 --> 00:56:14,949
Speaker 1: But I think it's called like mastering magic cards or something.

878
00:56:14,969 --> 00:56:16,696
Speaker 0: Oh serpent generator came back in fifth edition.

879
00:56:17,197 --> 00:56:17,719
Speaker 1: Okay, fine.

880
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:33,820
Speaker 1: anyway, the point is that You know you when in the old days you had the limited money Limited resources right that local meta was sort of forced except for very connected people who could get around right?

881
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:43,160
Speaker 1: Nowadays with the internet, even if you have a local meta any person just knows Right what the best shit is and can buy the best shit on the internet.

882
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:47,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, everything's available the knowledge is available and the stuff is available to everyone.

883
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:55,203
Speaker 0: But then if you make a two-player game that's locally customizable like actually seven wonders duel Two-player drafts.

884
00:56:55,764 --> 00:56:56,867
Speaker 0: that gets real fun.

885
00:56:56,887 --> 00:56:58,251
Speaker 0: Mmm that gets real.

886
00:56:58,311 --> 00:57:01,840
Speaker 0: actually seven wonders duel is a like phenomenal standout game.

887
00:57:02,706 --> 00:57:03,332
Speaker 0: Have you played it?

888
00:57:05,401 --> 00:57:07,830
