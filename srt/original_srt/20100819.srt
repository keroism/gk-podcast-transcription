1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,226
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, August 19th.

2
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:11,868
Speaker 0: I'm Ram.

3
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:12,489
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,894
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:15,980
Speaker 0: Tonight, Scott Pilgrim, the movie.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,252
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:29,610
Speaker 0: I think I'm done buying stuff in person ever.

8
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,824
Speaker 0: I gave the physical world the benefit of the doubt today.

9
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:35,210
Speaker 0: I needed new patch cables.

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,690
Speaker 0: I thought, you know, we bought the new firewire thing and Geek Nights stuff, and I need all new, like, balanced quarter-inch patch cables to do my full setup the way I want.

11
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:48,690
Speaker 0: And I figure I'll just stop at Sam Ash or rest, you know, the row over there with all those different audio stores.

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,179
Speaker 1: You mean the row that's right outside my work?

13
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:51,909
Speaker 1: I don't even have to cross the street to get to it?

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:59,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I figured I'd go over there and just see if I could find what I needed physically, because one, supporting local business, and two...

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,418
Speaker 1: It's not a local business.

16
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:01,729
Speaker 1: Sam Ash is a mega chain.

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,110
Speaker 0: Well, I went to all the other audio stores around there, too.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,270
Speaker 1: Those are mostly just guitar repair guys.

19
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,190
Speaker 0: No, they actually all have the same kind of stuff, usually cheaper.

20
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:10,516
Speaker 1: I walk there every day.

21
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:13,649
Speaker 1: I don't really see any other stores that sell that besides Sam Ash.

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:20,990
Speaker 0: All right, well, you're wrong, but regardless, none of them had anything even close to what I needed, and I don't think what I need is that weird.

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,677
Speaker 0: So I looked on Amazon, plenty.

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,442
Speaker 0: I'm done.

25
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:24,830
Speaker 0: I'm just not going to stores anymore.

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,790
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you probably... Your cables, you probably should have gone to Monoprice.

27
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,010
Speaker 0: No, Monoprice isn't really good for audio stuff like that.

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,350
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

29
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:36,230
Speaker 0: I need 90-degree to 90-degree balanced quarter-inch cables.

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,748
Speaker 0: Did you look?

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,081
Speaker 0: Yeah.

32
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:38,310
Speaker 1: On Monoprice?

33
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,348
Speaker 0: Monoprice was the one that had their whole customer database compromised, credit cards and everything, so...

34
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,014
Speaker 1: Who cares?

35
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:44,769
Speaker 1: What's going to happen to you?

36
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:47,609
Speaker 0: I could get my credit card numbers stolen, be a pain in the ass.

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,510
Speaker 1: And then you go to the website for your credit card, you push one button, and then you fix it.

38
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,501
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'd still be a pain in the ass.

39
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:53,290
Speaker 0: I also don't want to support...

40
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,650
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, yeah, that's right.

41
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,669
Speaker 1: Coming from you, the person's a pain in the ass to even just do a Google search.

42
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,290
Speaker 0: I also don't want to support a business that has shoddy IT.

43
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,694
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

44
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:02,699
Speaker 1: They have $2 cables, so yeah.

45
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't have the kind of cables I need specifically.

46
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:10,050
Speaker 0: I did find what I need, because I could get away with using adapters.

47
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:19,337
Speaker 0: I did, but adapters, the kind of adapters we're using now, are what caused Scott Suck in the past, because I tested it.

48
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:21,010
Speaker 0: I found the bad adapter.

49
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,538
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

50
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:23,346
Speaker 1: Are you 100% confident?

51
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, there might be a...

52
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,570
Speaker 1: Because I know there was a show when we just started.

53
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I think that's a different problem.

54
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:28,852
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

55
00:02:28,873 --> 00:02:29,949
Speaker 1: When it come, we got all these problems.

56
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:31,970
Speaker 0: We've had a lot of them for a while.

57
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,910
Speaker 1: You're replacing a whole lot of parts, but the problem is still there.

58
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,738
Speaker 1: What have I replaced?

59
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:36,030
Speaker 0: Scott, what have I replaced?

60
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,630
Speaker 1: Replaced XLR cable.

61
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:38,897
Speaker 0: All right, and you know what?

62
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,290
Speaker 0: The one I replaced was broken.

63
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,059
Speaker 0: I threw it away.

64
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,688
Speaker 0: It doesn't work.

65
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:42,325
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

66
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,069
Speaker 0: The soldering all came out in one of the ends.

67
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:44,533
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

68
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:45,869
Speaker 1: It's probably because you stepped on it.

69
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:46,673
Speaker 0: Actually, no.

70
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,990
Speaker 0: It was yours, and it was broken at your microphone end, so...

71
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,553
Speaker 1: You know what I'm saying?

72
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:54,650
Speaker 1: You stepped on it after you replaced it, just like you did with your DS inside.

73
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:57,429
Speaker 0: The DS I dropped while I was playing Pokemon.

74
00:02:58,819 --> 00:02:59,169
Speaker 1: On purpose.

75
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:00,013
Speaker 0: Yeah.

76
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:02,529
Speaker 0: I broke my DS on purpose to buy another DS.

77
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, just like you broke the XLR cable on purpose to make you feel good about buying another XLR cable.

78
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,667
Speaker 0: You realize, had my DS not broken, Daddy 2 PP.

79
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:19,392
Speaker 0: Why would Daddy only want 1 PP when he could have had 2?

80
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:24,429
Speaker 0: But that aside, we're actually bringing Carl Custer's coming over tomorrow, and we're going to do some audio stuff.

81
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:25,688
Speaker 1: All right.

82
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:25,810
Speaker 1: Okay.

83
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:27,830
Speaker 0: I'm going to use him to recalibrate.

84
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm about halfway through recalibrating all the new equipment, and once they get the new patch cables, I can finish that.

85
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,890
Speaker 1: You and your non-stop calibrating.

86
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,310
Speaker 1: All right, you want me to knock it?

87
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,309
Speaker 1: Maybe you should do something.

88
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,930
Speaker 1: Calibrating is important, but you know what's more important?

89
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,400
Speaker 0: Getting the flight for John St.

90
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,970
Speaker 0: John to come to the PAX Late Show and be our guest.

91
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:46,930
Speaker 0: That's a good thing to do.

92
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,154
Speaker 0: I got that.

93
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:47,829
Speaker 0: You saw my email.

94
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,373
Speaker 1: All right.

95
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:49,430
Speaker 1: You know what else is more important?

96
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:50,355
Speaker 0: Let's see.

97
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:52,810
Speaker 0: Getting the musical act for the Late Show, which I totally covered.

98
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,212
Speaker 1: All right.

99
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:57,430
Speaker 1: You know what's more important than... You know, less important than the Late Show, but more important than calibrating?

100
00:03:58,555 --> 00:03:59,146
Speaker 0: I don't know, Scott.

101
00:03:59,207 --> 00:03:59,370
Speaker 0: What?

102
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,272
Speaker 1: I don't know.

103
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:05,710
Speaker 1: Any of the five or six things you need to do, like get e-commerce.

104
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:06,226
Speaker 1: Eh.

105
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,327
Speaker 1: Or... Okay.

106
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,870
Speaker 0: E-commerce is low on my list right now.

107
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,289
Speaker 1: Pay me money that you owe me.

108
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,522
Speaker 0: You owe me a lot of money, too.

109
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:13,149
Speaker 0: You owe me thousands.

110
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,790
Speaker 1: All right, so you haven't even calculated what I owe you, though.

111
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:16,904
Speaker 0: It's over 2,000.

112
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:17,249
Speaker 0: I know that.

113
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,678
Speaker 1: I know how many pennies you owe me.

114
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,119
Speaker 1: Exactly.

115
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:21,829
Speaker 1: All right.

116
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:27,370
Speaker 1: So if we went to court, I could probably fight and say, "Look, he doesn't even have records of how much I owe him.

117
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:27,798
Speaker 1: I don't owe him

118
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:28,043
Speaker 1: shit.".

119
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:29,708
Speaker 0: You know what?

120
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,069
Speaker 0: I'd ever sign any debt agreements with you.

121
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,482
Speaker 0: It would be word against word, so...

122
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would be word and accounting documentation and receipts versus word.

123
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,450
Speaker 0: I haven't got a small claims court, but the thing is, I'm pretty sure that I do.

124
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,462
Speaker 0: In the end, I'll owe you money instead of you owing me, but it's not going to be more than $1,000 or so, I think.

125
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,062
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

126
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,410
Speaker 0: You owe me a lot of hotel rooms and some lights.

127
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,489
Speaker 1: That is true, but it does not mean you should...

128
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:57,309
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah.

129
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,528
Speaker 1: This is very important, more important than calibrating, but you haven't done it in...

130
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,550
Speaker 0: Why is it that important?

131
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,447
Speaker 1: Because you owe me some fucking money.

132
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,197
Speaker 0: How about?

133
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,190
Speaker 0: I'll just give you like, I don't know, three grand, we'll call it even.

134
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,644
Speaker 1: Okay.

135
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,190
Speaker 0: Oh, so you're okay with just glossing over the details.

136
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,769
Speaker 1: Plus, because the total that I've calculated is not much more than three grand, so if I can get three grand, sure.

137
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,050
Speaker 0: But there's an unknown factor.

138
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:21,849
Speaker 0: You're taking a big risk on what my calculation is.

139
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,649
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

140
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,210
Speaker 1: If you give a calculation of a zero, three grand is fine.

141
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,548
Speaker 0: But you owe me hotel rooms since the... You don't even know.

142
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:31,722
Speaker 1: You don't have it recorded.

143
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,008
Speaker 0: Actually, I do.

144
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,835
Speaker 0: It's the Katsu-Kan.

145
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,669
Speaker 0: before the last Katsu-Kan we went to.

146
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:37,049
Speaker 1: So the one I was sick at?

147
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:37,529
Speaker 0: Yeah.

148
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:37,957
Speaker 0: Yeah.

149
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,929
Speaker 0: 'Cause that was the second to last one we went to.

150
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,410
Speaker 1: So you just admitted how long it's been and you're the only one holding up this operation.

151
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's been for fuck ever and I'm a lazy ass.

152
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,329
Speaker 1: It's all right.

153
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:50,269
Speaker 1: So lazy you can't even click a link to fix your credit card or do a Google search.

154
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,570
Speaker 0: My credit card's not broken.

155
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,283
Speaker 0: I would rather avoid.

156
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,809
Speaker 1: Clicking one link is so hard.

157
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,829
Speaker 1: Oh, Rand, we can't be bothered to click one link.

158
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,462
Speaker 0: So, Scott, you got any news?

159
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,988
Speaker 1: It's sort of it.

160
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:09,029
Speaker 1: It normally would be thing of the day material, but I'm gonna pretend that this is a new development or discovery and call it a news.

161
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,750
Speaker 1: But anyway, somebody found some coprolites.

162
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,230
Speaker 1: Do you know what coprolites are?

163
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,029
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

164
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,429
Speaker 1: It's basically a poop fossil.

165
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:18,390
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

166
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:18,850
Speaker 1: Okay.

167
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:19,652
Speaker 1: So...

168
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,470
Speaker 0: It took me a minute to parse all those words together to figure out what you really meant.

169
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:25,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, so someone found some poop fossils.

170
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:25,909
Speaker 1: All right.

171
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,670
Speaker 1: And the poop fossils have shark teeth marks in them, right?

172
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,250
Speaker 0: So clearly the sharks tried to eat the poop.

173
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:37,129
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, right, if the shark ate the poop, how can the poop is in one piece?

174
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,030
Speaker 0: Shark failed?

175
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:39,187
Speaker 1: Well, no.

176
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,390
Speaker 1: Why did the shark... The shark didn't eat the poop.

177
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,609
Speaker 1: It bit the poop.

178
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:45,944
Speaker 0: Tried to eat it, realized it was poop, and went, "Oh shit, it's

179
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:46,269
Speaker 0: poop!".

180
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:47,429
Speaker 1: No, not at all.

181
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:51,669
Speaker 1: So the thing is, it's like, okay, we know the shark didn't eat the poop.

182
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,810
Speaker 0: Did someone make a shark tooth weapon and hit the poop?

183
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,310
Speaker 1: No, these are old fossils.

184
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,990
Speaker 1: These are like extinct sharks that are like ancestors of tiger sharks.

185
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,030
Speaker 0: All right, so did some dinosaur make a stick and stick?

186
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,530
Speaker 0: It's not that old.

187
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,050
Speaker 0: Okay.

188
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,090
Speaker 1: Do you know why the... Here's the theory.

189
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,528
Speaker 0: Clearly I do not know.

190
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,490
Speaker 1: Here's the theory on why the sharks bit the poop without, and it's kind of awesome, you ready?

191
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,388
Speaker 0: Bit the poop.

192
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:35,649
Speaker 1: The pattern of the bite marks and the fact that the feces were not ingested is consistent with a reconstruction in which, during an attack on another animal, the shark bit through the body into the guts and left tooth impressions or bit the intestines after disemboweling the prey and left the tooth marks on the poop in that manner.

193
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,730
Speaker 1: But then didn't actually, of course, eat the poop.

194
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:47,290
Speaker 1: And then the poop probably fell out of the intestine and then, you know, it had the shark's tooth mark in it and then turned into a poop fossil.

195
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,609
Speaker 0: That's some fine detective work there, Lou.

196
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,450
Speaker 1: Coprolite.

197
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:51,928
Speaker 0: That's your news?

198
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:53,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta give me some coprolites.

199
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:55,889
Speaker 0: Put 'em on the wall?

200
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'd be awesome.

201
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,305
Speaker 1: People are like, "Oh, what's

202
00:07:58,346 --> 00:07:58,509
Speaker 1: that?".

203
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,595
Speaker 1: I'd be like, "That is a

204
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:01,141
Speaker 1: coprolite.".

205
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,790
Speaker 0: That is something awesome.

206
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:05,509
Speaker 1: Look how smart I am.

207
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,227
Speaker 1: Why don't you touch it?

208
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:06,950
Speaker 1: Lick it.

209
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,766
Speaker 1: How you lick poop.

210
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:10,670
Speaker 1: Now, here's something I don't understand.

211
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,290
Speaker 1: This is probably gonna sound really stupid, right?

212
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:12,849
Speaker 0: No, all right.

213
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,110
Speaker 1: All right, the poop fossil, the coprolite, it looks like a rock, right?

214
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:17,850
Speaker 0: My poop kind of looks like a rock.

215
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,430
Speaker 0: It's just brown.

216
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:19,370
Speaker 1: No, no, no, I mean, look at it.

217
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,228
Speaker 1: Like, it's a rock.

218
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:24,710
Speaker 1: It's not, it's not, I mean, is it a poop that gets-- What kind of girly poop do you have?

219
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,830
Speaker 0: Mine is like a boulder.

220
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:33,990
Speaker 1: Well, I'm saying it's like, is it a poop that gets hard over time, or is it like, there's a rock that forms around a poop, and then the fossil is the rock.

221
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,890
Speaker 0: If it's a fossil, it's probably been replaced with minerals.

222
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,110
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was a poop that got replaced with a rock.

223
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,789
Speaker 0: Kind of like a petrified wood, I guess.

224
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not actually the poop.

225
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:46,450
Speaker 1: That is, it's not actually an old poop.

226
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:49,449
Speaker 0: It's actually-- It's an object in the shape of an old poop.

227
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:51,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, good, all right.

228
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,709
Speaker 1: That's what I, I just wanted to confirm that.

229
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,110
Speaker 0: Kind of like a shaped charge in a bomb, it's a shaped poop.

230
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not, but like a dinosaur egg is actually a dinosaur egg.

231
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,790
Speaker 0: Is it, or is it also fossilized, do you know?

232
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:01,770
Speaker 1: I don't know.

233
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,390
Speaker 1: I'm a computer scientist, not an archeologist.

234
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:10,910
Speaker 0: I got something that'll generate, I think, more interesting, well, interesting in a more academic sense discussion.

235
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:15,350
Speaker 0: So there was a law in California, in Rosedale, California.

236
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:25,189
Speaker 0: The law was since struck down by courts, and I don't know what happened beyond that, but the law was interesting because it says a lot about where we as humans have become, or have gotten to.

237
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:48,690
Speaker 0: The law prohibited in malls, it was actually a policy in this like shopping district, if you cannot approach a stranger, someone with whom you do not have a preexisting or current relationship, and proceed to engage with them in any conversation that is not directly related to the mall or its wellbeing.

238
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,050
Speaker 1: Okay, that's kind of a, I don't think that law is constitutional.

239
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,228
Speaker 0: No, why not?

240
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:16,629
Speaker 0: Because here's the rationale for the law was people were in this space, this private space, and they were constantly annoyed by strangers who would come up to them and try to peddle or solicit, or here's the trouble, they would mostly be religious people trying to convert you, which wasn't in fact, like it didn't count as busking or anything.

241
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,250
Speaker 1: - Well, here is my, the way you worded it at least, obviously that wasn't the actual wording of the law.

242
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,210
Speaker 0: - The law was pretty close to that, the law was pretty poorly written.

243
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:28,990
Speaker 1: - As you spoke, you couldn't converse with people.

244
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:35,849
Speaker 1: Now the thing is, that would be a freedom of speech infringement, and Congress shall make no law, and you said this was a law, right?

245
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:38,306
Speaker 1: So that would be unconstitutional.

246
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:55,890
Speaker 1: in the eyes of Scott Rubin, however, they could have easily, and I would have been no problem, if the law simply said you may not solicit, because that is a regulation of commerce, and as we know, the Commerce Clause allows anyone in any level of government has the ultimate right to regulate commerce, period.

247
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,050
Speaker 0: - So here's the trouble with all that.

248
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:03,610
Speaker 1: - So they could have just banned all commercial speech amongst strangers, while allowing all other non-commercial forms of speech.

249
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,690
Speaker 1: -

250
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:24,150
Speaker 0: Here's the trouble, the thing, the law is poorly written, and that's kind of a separate issue, I think, the fact that societies and people, especially in America, will identify, like a community will say, X is a problem, and they'll say, we should do something about X, and they all agree, and they will, without fail, write the most vague, horrifying, constitutionally laughable law they can.

251
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:33,930
Speaker 1: - They could have just banned all commercial speech by people who are not renting in the mall, and in fact, if the mall is privately owned, the mall could just make a mall rule, and have their own security guards--.

252
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:44,169
Speaker 0: - But from what I can gather from locals, the impetus of the law, the reason for this rule, was that there were religious people walking up to people, and just starting conversations.

253
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:54,890
Speaker 1: - Well, that's another problem, is that religion is a special thing, and in fact, it should be classified as commerce, because they shouldn't be non-profit, or given special non-profit status.

254
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,850
Speaker 0: - Yeah, they should be non-profit, that can be totally okay.

255
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,630
Speaker 1: - But even so, non-profit commerce is commerce.

256
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:08,270
Speaker 1: So therefore, you could have banned the religious speech, along with the commercial speech, but the First Amendment actually has the word religion in it, and that makes that difficult to do.

257
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,240
Speaker 1: - And the other problem-- - But if I was in charge, I would amend that.

258
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,422
Speaker 1: - So

259
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:25,288
Speaker 0: the other problem that was designed to deal with is annoying locals and homeless people who would just bother people, but not in such a way that they wouldn't stalk 'em, or yell at 'em, or scream at 'em, just come up and kind of talk at you in a really annoying way.

260
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,154
Speaker 1: - Say go away?

261
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:32,750
Speaker 0: - All right, and they kinda, maybe they do, maybe they don't, but they keep bothering everyone in the mall.

262
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:43,688
Speaker 1: - At that point, they're harassing and/or assaulting, or who knows, there is some other law you could put into effect, or have rules without laws of the mall, and the mall security guards could do it, to handle that.

263
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:51,210
Speaker 1: You don't need to have police and an extra law, where an existing law or an amendment to an existing law will probably suffice.

264
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,330
Speaker 0: - So what if the mall had just had its own policy of no talking to strangers no matter what, inside our private property?

265
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,590
Speaker 1: - They could do that if they wanted to.

266
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,827
Speaker 0: - No, they can't, the court said they can't.

267
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,543
Speaker 0: - Really?

268
00:12:59,563 --> 00:12:59,768
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

269
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,120
Speaker 1: - Interesting.

270
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:01,470
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

271
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,230
Speaker 0: But here's another semi-related thing.

272
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,430
Speaker 0: So I took New Jersey transit--.

273
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,210
Speaker 1: - I mean, 'cause if I have a house, right?

274
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,270
Speaker 1: - I could just say, anyone who comes to my house, no talking.

275
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,190
Speaker 0: - And, did you hear anything I said?

276
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,910
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you went to the shore, you brought something home.

277
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:18,923
Speaker 0: - Okay.

278
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:19,190
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

279
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,010
Speaker 0: - So, I had to go back from New Brunswick.

280
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,090
Speaker 1: - Oh, right.

281
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:32,210
Speaker 0: - Which, New Brunswick smells to such a degree, pervasively, that I would be very happy as a human being if I never in my life have to return to New Brunswick.

282
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,710
Speaker 1: - I think you're conversing New Brunswick for New Jersey.

283
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:41,950
Speaker 0: - No, no, no, because there are nice parts of New Jersey, and there are parts of New Jersey that do not smell the way New Brunswick smells.

284
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,849
Speaker 1: - All right, so where are these places?

285
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,089
Speaker 0: - South Jersey smells nice.

286
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,030
Speaker 1: - That is not South Jersey, that is Delaware.

287
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,450
Speaker 0: - I just said South Jersey smells nice.

288
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,290
Speaker 1: - There's no such, no, that's Delaware.

289
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,183
Speaker 0: - That's Delaware?

290
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:54,449
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

291
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,950
Speaker 0: - Why don't we just make it part of New York?

292
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,648
Speaker 0: Why don't we just take it?

293
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,350
Speaker 1: - No, that's North Jersey.

294
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,330
Speaker 0: - No, but then it's like some sad borough, we don't want that, it's like Staten Island, the smelly borough in the corner.

295
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:11,708
Speaker 1: - No, no, we're only taking the part that's directly, we're only taking like Englewood and those areas, and the metal lands.

296
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:24,830
Speaker 0: - So regardless, from New Brunswick, I had to get on New Jersey Transit, which despite being far closer to the city than Trenton, the train took about the same amount of time to get home from there than it would have from Trenton.

297
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,070
Speaker 1: - Yeah, pretty much only the path is useful, the Jersey Transit is basically Metro North minus minus.

298
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,810
Speaker 0: - The SEPTA was better than the New Jersey Transit, though the train itself was comfortable, but everything around the train was disgusting.

299
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,448
Speaker 1: - Yeah, just take the path, dude.

300
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:43,549
Speaker 0: - So, New Brunswick, and I'm reading the sign, and there is a new policy on New Jersey Transit, it's an experimental policy.

301
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:54,650
Speaker 0: There are, during all commuter times on every train now, quiet cars, motherfuckers can't talk, use cell phones, do anything that makes noise.

302
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,210
Speaker 1: - Why does Metro North have that shit?

303
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,431
Speaker 1: - I

304
00:14:56,471 --> 00:15:25,010
Speaker 0: know, but in a way it's the same thing, look at what's happening here, and this happens all over more and more, people are making, like society can no longer deal with itself, and people, rather than kind of having social pressure to change social mores around them, they would rather legislate or have rules, because, think about it, shouldn't people just get the fact that all right, it's four in the morning, maybe I should be quiet on the train where everybody else is sleeping?

305
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,208
Speaker 1: - No, because we have freedom, you can't tell me what to do.

306
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,530
Speaker 1: So, and that's, I guess you don't wanna give that up, right?

307
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,450
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but at the same time, freedom comes with the responsibility to use your freedom responsibly.

308
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:53,077
Speaker 1: - Yes, but we have also, here's the problem, right, we have given people the freedom, right, and at the same time, we have taken away your right to hit somebody, so, therefore, if someone's being a jerk, you can't do anything about it, like when I was in that barber shop with the really racist

309
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:53,499
Speaker 0: guy,

310
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:55,448
Speaker 1: right, you can't do shit.

311
00:15:56,431 --> 00:16:04,910
Speaker 1: So, the only, we can either get rid of the law and let us hit each other, or we can legislate to force people to shut the fuck up.

312
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,870
Speaker 0: - I'm gonna use a pendulatism, the law is just government hitting in your place.

313
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,250
Speaker 1: - Yes, but it is not actually knocking teeth out and making Dennis mad bank, so it's maybe saving us something.

314
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,690
Speaker 0: - Is it, but I mean, is it or is it not?

315
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,570
Speaker 1: - And also, what if, you know, the loud guy is big and the person who wants it quiet is small?

316
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,450
Speaker 0: - Well, what if the loud guy's big and there's--.

317
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,410
Speaker 1: - The government has the biggest fist.

318
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,570
Speaker 0: - I think the biggest guy wouldn't win against 40 angry commuters.

319
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:36,489
Speaker 1: - The thing is, the people don't even wanna, you know, don't wanna fight, I mean, even if you win the fight, you bloody your knuckles, it's like, ah, you don't wanna deal with that.

320
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,969
Speaker 0: - Or it's maybe the conductor, maybe he should have the power to hit.

321
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,970
Speaker 1: - Conductor should just be a policeman.

322
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,689
Speaker 0: - He kinda is, in the fact that you can't hit him.

323
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,060
Speaker 1: - I know, but you can.

324
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,189
Speaker 1: (laughs) No, they should just make conductors also officers of the law, why not?

325
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,570
Speaker 1: Is there, yeah, why not?

326
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,250
Speaker 0: - Do you wanna give them the, I mean, that comes with a lot of extra power, though.

327
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,769
Speaker 0: I don't know if we want that.

328
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,627
Speaker 1: - What are they gonna do?

329
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,010
Speaker 0: - I mean, theoretically, to become a police officer requires more training than to become a train conductor.

330
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,730
Speaker 1: it'd be double training and they'd get even more money.

331
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,470
Speaker 0: - See, I have this weird sinking feeling suddenly that train conductors have more training than police officers.

332
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:21,910
Speaker 1: - We could do is we could just have, instead of making the conductor also a policeman, just have a policeman on every train, just one, maybe two.

333
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,329
Speaker 0: - I guess it's more, at what point-- - I mean, sometimes they're on there.

334
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:38,770
Speaker 0: - Do we, in a society where now culture is fractured and people in a physical place very often have very little culture in common, because their culture comes from the internet, comes from media, all these other places, so there isn't this common code of conduct.

335
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:39,509
Speaker 0: Like, look at Otacon.

336
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:46,850
Speaker 0: The people in Otacon, by and large, act the way they wanna act, and most of them are cool with that manner of acting.

337
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:49,289
Speaker 0: And people like us are kind of the odd people out.

338
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,728
Speaker 0: So we want all these rules to get those kids to shut up.

339
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:59,709
Speaker 0: And yet, at the same time, at PAX-- - No, I don't want them to either, but we and the, our age, everyone but the two of us.

340
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:01,927
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, look at PAX.

341
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:09,068
Speaker 0: We don't want those screaming kids running around, and yet, notice how there are no screaming kids running around, yet there are kids.

342
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,730
Speaker 1: - Well, it says, you know, the seven rules of PAX, we have those rules in place.

343
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,870
Speaker 1: That pretty much covers everything.

344
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,550
Speaker 0: - But at the same time, the rules never need to be enforced.

345
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:18,570
Speaker 1: - They're enforced.

346
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,309
Speaker 0: - There's-- - They're in fact enforcers that enforce those seven rules.

347
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,785
Speaker 0: - You see punk kids running around, causing mischief at PAX.

348
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,330
Speaker 1: - It's because the rules are actually enforced well.

349
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,530
Speaker 1: It's not like US laws where they're selectively kind of enforced sometimes.

350
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,689
Speaker 0: - See, you know, is it really, because I don't even see them, is it that they're being enforced?

351
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,690
Speaker 0: Because there aren't rules about being annoying punk kids.

352
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,870
Speaker 1: - Well, the thing is, right, as soon as someone, there is a rule that says don't harass people.

353
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,810
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but it's not harassment to just be annoying.

354
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:50,130
Speaker 0: To just be that fanboy.

355
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:50,947
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it is.

356
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,070
Speaker 1: - That's not harassment.

357
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,210
Speaker 1: - If you're being that fanboy, but you're not talking to anyone or getting your fanboy on anybody, you're not harassing anybody.

358
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,770
Speaker 1: - So if you go up to somebody--.

359
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,170
Speaker 0: - So we should have a rule saying the fanboy can't talk to anyone?

360
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,810
Speaker 1: - Well, no, if he goes up to, if the fanboy turns off his fanboyism, then it's okay.

361
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,285
Speaker 1: - If he goes up and he says, "Hey, you wanna play Chez

362
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:09,529
Speaker 1: Geek?"

363
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:11,910
Speaker 1: And you just say no, and he goes away, that's fine.

364
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,281
Speaker 1: But if he comes, he goes like, "Come

365
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:13,624
Speaker 1: on.".

366
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,750
Speaker 0: - So say he does that, Scott.

367
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:19,950
Speaker 0: Are you saying that there should be a rule against that?

368
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,770
Speaker 1: - There is a rule against that.

369
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,549
Speaker 0: - What is that rule?

370
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,528
Speaker 1: - Don't harass people.

371
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,710
Speaker 0: - How is that harassment?

372
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,569
Speaker 1: - He's bothering you, and you told him, you asked him nicely to go away, and he didn't.

373
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,269
Speaker 1: You told him no, and no didn't mean no.

374
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:32,187
Speaker 1: That's it.

375
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,390
Speaker 0: - So what if he didn't ask you anything?

376
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,530
Speaker 0: He's just standing next to you in line, and he's a really annoying, loud fanboy.

377
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,490
Speaker 1: - Right, so he's just standing next to you in line.

378
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,710
Speaker 0: - And he's talking to other people, and they don't like him either, but they don't tell him to go away.

379
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,448
Speaker 1: - Did they ask him to go away?

380
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,890
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and he's in line.

381
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,688
Speaker 0: He's not gonna go away.

382
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,946
Speaker 1: - All right, so turn behind and say, "Look, could you please keep it

383
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:49,168
Speaker 1: down?".

384
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,350
Speaker 0: - Okay, so he's quieter, but he's just as annoying.

385
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,904
Speaker 1: - Hey, listen, really, can you just--.

386
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,470
Speaker 0: - Can you, are you gonna tell him to stop talking?

387
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:58,725
Speaker 1: - Why not?

388
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,090
Speaker 0: - The topic of his conversation is itself the annoying thing.

389
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,490
Speaker 1: - Oh, okay, listen, could you please change the subject?

390
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,230
Speaker 1: It is grossing me out.

391
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,369
Speaker 0: - No, in fact, you're bothering me by telling me to change my topic.

392
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,350
Speaker 1: - He enforces me to just come and decide.

393
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:20,350
Speaker 0: - So you want some sort of higher authority to enforce your personal view on what is and is not acceptable behavior when no harm is being done.

394
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,527
Speaker 1: - Well, it's only because it packs.

395
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,430
Speaker 0: I know the enforcer-- - You want them all to have the rules saying people can't fucking talk to people.

396
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,910
Speaker 1: - No, it's just I happen to know that the enforcer will pass judgment properly.

397
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,665
Speaker 0: - No, he won't.

398
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,569
Speaker 0: You know what, look what happens at PAX.

399
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:36,187
Speaker 0: Anyone who's annoying, no one needs to walk over and say, "Hey, stop it,".

400
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:43,509
Speaker 0: because the collective zeitgeist of the people at the con makes people who are annoying feel uncomfortable and stop it on their own.

401
00:20:44,412 --> 00:21:03,369
Speaker 0: I'm saying, I think, my moral is that society, in America at least, in the past, because the culture was more shared, and to a little degree, because hitting could happen much more readily, these two things combined kept very annoying people from being able to be annoying for terribly long.

402
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:10,509
Speaker 0: And now, there are people, and I think we should bless these people because they're the ones who kind of remind us the price of freedom.

403
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,410
Speaker 1: - Who dish out hitting.

404
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,085
Speaker 0: - No, no.

405
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:21,330
Speaker 0: The annoying fuckers are the people who remind us that freedom is important, because if we're willing to put up with them, we're able to accept the responsibility of freedom.

406
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:31,930
Speaker 0: But now we've got people who want laws to basically stop the annoying people from being annoying, and we no longer have a tight-knit society that shames them into being quiet.

407
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:33,890
Speaker 1: - Okay.

408
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,169
Speaker 0: - So you suddenly have nothing to say about that?

409
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,390
Speaker 1: - I think I'm done with it.

410
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,250
Speaker 1: This has gone on for too long.

411
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,719
Speaker 1: - Has it?

412
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:39,129
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

413
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,630
Speaker 0: - Has it really?

414
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:41,429
Speaker 0: You liking my news to end?

415
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,768
Speaker 1: - I like it a news to end.

416
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:44,909
Speaker 0: - Did you show you like it a news to end?

417
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:55,920
Speaker 0: Hey, listeners, you wanted the... Okay, so things of the day.

418
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,279
Speaker 1: - You liking the thing of the day to end?

419
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,500
Speaker 0: - Maybe after I do mine.

420
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:02,520
Speaker 0: Do you have a thing of the day?

421
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,499
Speaker 1: - Oh, you want me to go first?

422
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,357
Speaker 0: - You can go first.

423
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,599
Speaker 1: - All right, so I think I'm gonna turn the tables on Riff, and I'm gonna use a video from College Humor.

424
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,259
Speaker 1: - Oh, shit.

425
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,500
Speaker 1: - But the thing is, there were actually a whole bunch of good ones recently, so I don't know which one to pick.

426
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,238
Speaker 0: - It's hard to say.

427
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:20,558
Speaker 0: I mean, some of them are old, but it's one of those, if it's new to me.

428
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,560
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I'm gonna think I'm gonna pick this one.

429
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,840
Speaker 1: that's actually a College Humor original.

430
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,340
Speaker 1: So it was made by the College Humor people.

431
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,640
Speaker 0: - College Humor originals are really on the internet.

432
00:22:30,864 --> 00:22:33,620
Speaker 0: They're like, pre-seeing, post-seeing is different.

433
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:41,360
Speaker 0: I mean, anything that is good is good, but pre-seeing, on average, a College Humor original will beat pretty much any other random video on the internet.

434
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,160
Speaker 1: - Well, they're professionals.

435
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,620
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

436
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:50,800
Speaker 1: But anyway, so this video, it depicts some metal dudes from Norway, and apparently, they're Satanists.

437
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:55,020
Speaker 1: And they have pictures for Christians.

438
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,580
Speaker 0: - Pictures for Christians!

439
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,337
Speaker 1: - And they have many pictures that they want Christians to see that they think Christians don't wanna see.

440
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:06,559
Speaker 1: Because they are Satanists, and they like Satan 'cause he's awesome.

441
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:08,439
Speaker 1: And you should watch this video.

442
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,780
Speaker 0: - It's pretty damn good.

443
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:12,440
Speaker 0: Your video is not stuttering.

444
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:14,060
Speaker 0: It is that way on purpose.

445
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,726
Speaker 0: It is a slideshow.

446
00:23:14,747 --> 00:23:15,660
Speaker 0: - That's Satan Club!

447
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,220
Speaker 0: - All right, so there's a man, a very famous man.

448
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,478
Speaker 0: I'm not talking about-- - Was a man.

449
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,928
Speaker 0: - I'm not talking about Henry Earl.

450
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:25,459
Speaker 0: - In Russian long ago.

451
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,820
Speaker 0: - Because Henry Earl is awesome.

452
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,393
Speaker 1: - He was big, thin, strong.

453
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:30,080
Speaker 1: - And sad in a different way.

454
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,999
Speaker 1: - And his eyes are flaming.

455
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,939
Speaker 0: - But this is another Thark Park man.

456
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:34,820
Speaker 0: And I talked about him before.

457
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:36,399
Speaker 0: I used him as a newsworthy thing of the day.

458
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:39,440
Speaker 0: His name is Tribbit, Patrick Tribbit.

459
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,720
Speaker 1: - Is that his real name?

460
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,620
Speaker 0: - Yes, Patrick Tribbit.

461
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,120
Speaker 1: - His parents gave him that name?

462
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:43,960
Speaker 0: - I guess.

463
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:47,019
Speaker 0: He was the paint huffing guy.

464
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,318
Speaker 0: You know that guy.

465
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,860
Speaker 1: - Oh, that guy who had the gold paint all over his face.

466
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,400
Speaker 0: - Yes, and the warrior's shirt, and the kind of crooked smile.

467
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:54,480
Speaker 0: And then he was on Thark.

468
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:05,403
Speaker 0: He's like one of the most, there was a little award that Thark made up for itself of the pixels of the gold paint on his mouth as the most replicated pixels from 2001 to 2005.

469
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,699
Speaker 1: - So he is the new Henry Earl?

470
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,580
Speaker 0: - No, he's been around for a while.

471
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,040
Speaker 0: Him and Henry Earl were kind of parallel tracks.

472
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,958
Speaker 1: Why don't they get Henry Earl and him together in real life?

473
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,539
Speaker 0: - So here's the story.

474
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:21,020
Speaker 0: This guy was sad and funny because of this picture of him in the warrior's shirt with the gold paint.

475
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:25,660
Speaker 0: And he made Thark again later because his life was in shambles.

476
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:29,960
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're huffing paint, that's pretty much the bottom.

477
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,019
Speaker 1: - It's like you didn't even get enough money to buy drugs, you druggie.

478
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:36,800
Speaker 1: You went to the Home Depot and you got a can of spray paint for five bucks.

479
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,880
Speaker 1: 'cause that's all you could afford.

480
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,360
Speaker 0: - I mean, you can't even get a crack pipe and some crack.

481
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,657
Speaker 0: - So he saw the picture and all the fun that was made of him on.

482
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,540
Speaker 0: Thark had cleaned up his life.

483
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,419
Speaker 1: - How did he find it?

484
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,259
Speaker 0: - Someone recognized him and showed it to him.

485
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:56,740
Speaker 0: And he got help and there was this whole Thark article later and Thark was proud of him.

486
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:57,498
Speaker 0: I was proud of him.

487
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:04,740
Speaker 0: There were pictures of him smiling and running and working out and he talked about how seeing that picture made him realize how low he'd sunk and he fixed his life.

488
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,843
Speaker 1: - Maybe all we need to do to go to rehab places is they just take a picture of you and show it to you after.

489
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:16,020
Speaker 1: it just holds you in a room until you're sober and then show you what you looked like when you were disgusting.

490
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,578
Speaker 0: - Him rehabilitating himself was my thing of the day like a year ago.

491
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:21,000
Speaker 1: - Oh, I didn't remember.

492
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,820
Speaker 0: - My new thing of the day is a picture of him from a couple days ago, arrested, huffing paint.

493
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,999
Speaker 0: He looks so much sadder now.

494
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:33,925
Speaker 1: - Wow.

495
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,560
Speaker 0: - Even Thark didn't have the heart to make, well, one guy made fun of him.

496
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:47,080
Speaker 0: It showed the picture of him, happy, smiling, running on the track, having fixed his life and they Photoshopped in a guy handing him some paint.

497
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:53,380
Speaker 0: But the Thark thread was basically, wow, this is actually kind of sad.

498
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:54,858
Speaker 0: I was pulling for him.

499
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,619
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, what does it mean?

500
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,720
Speaker 1: I mean, do we even bother with the rehab?

501
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,800
Speaker 0: - Recidivism rates are pretty high.

502
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,040
Speaker 0: The worst part is I'm going to read, this is how sad it gets.

503
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,899
Speaker 0: I'm going to read the last paragraph of the article describing this.

504
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:15,100
Speaker 0: Officials say they don't know why Tribbett, who is from Wheeling, was in New Martinsville.

505
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,539
Speaker 1: - Because that's what the Home Depot was.

506
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,639
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and apparently leading up to this, he was arrested in several other Ohio Valley towns for huffing paint.

507
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,738
Speaker 1: - Oh, he's from Ohio.

508
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,060
Speaker 0: - Well, I think actually, I've got the answer to your question.

509
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,119
Speaker 1: - Leave Ohio.

510
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,780
Speaker 0: - Yes, leave Ohio.

511
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,259
Speaker 1: - Go somewhere with something to do besides soft paint.

512
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:38,279
Speaker 1: And look at your three buildings.

513
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,180
Speaker 1: - Meta moments.

514
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,240
Speaker 1: - You like the meta moments?

515
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,059
Speaker 1: (laughing).

516
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:46,457
Speaker 1: Meta moment, book club.

517
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,560
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the book club is The Golden Apples of the Sun by Ray Bradbury.

518
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,655
Speaker 0: It's a collection of short stories.

519
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,920
Speaker 0: They're all science fiction.

520
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,040
Speaker 0: Like I said, they are two to three pages.

521
00:26:55,462 --> 00:26:56,320
Speaker 0: I think one of them is six pages.

522
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,279
Speaker 1: - Well, how many are there?

523
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,080
Speaker 0: - Like 15.

524
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,758
Speaker 1: - Okay, that's not bad.

525
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,659
Speaker 0: - It's a short book of short stories.

526
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,156
Speaker 1: - What else?

527
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
Speaker 1: Conventions, packs?

528
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,557
Speaker 1: - New York A&M Festival, New York Comic Con, Combo Con.

529
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,899
Speaker 0: - We will be there.

530
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,839
Speaker 0: We'll be doing stuff.

531
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,240
Speaker 1: - There's 10, 10, 10, which I don't know.

532
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,940
Speaker 0: - Also that weekend.

533
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,660
Speaker 1: - Same weekend.

534
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,040
Speaker 0: - Yep.

535
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:18,778
Speaker 0: It's Thursday.

536
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,080
Speaker 0: We're only getting into all that, but the PAX one's the big one.

537
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,960
Speaker 0: We're doing our three panels.

538
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:27,360
Speaker 0: And of course, the biggest part, we are the hosts of PAX Late Night.

539
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:30,180
Speaker 0: We've got Alex Albrecht coming on the show as our guest.

540
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:30,718
Speaker 0: We've got--.

541
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,358
Speaker 1: - It's Albrecht.

542
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:31,756
Speaker 0: - Yep.

543
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,640
Speaker 1: - Eh, eh.

544
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:34,176
Speaker 1: Not E, eh.

545
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,214
Speaker 1: - I said ict.

546
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,120
Speaker 1: - You said ict.

547
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,737
Speaker 1: - I said ict.

548
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,658
Speaker 1: - You said Albrecht.

549
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,540
Speaker 1: - Albrecht.

550
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:38,995
Speaker 0: - Albrecht.

551
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,731
Speaker 0: - We've got John St.

552
00:27:42,134 --> 00:27:42,436
Speaker 0: John.

553
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,739
Speaker 1: - Maybe we should've, I feel like we should've kept that secret, but then he put it in the con book, so.

554
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,579
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it was in the con book before we announced it.

555
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,080
Speaker 1: - Before we even had it confirmed.

556
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,940
Speaker 1: It was confirmed today.

557
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,458
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

558
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,080
Speaker 1: - What if it didn't happen, but it was in the con book?

559
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,779
Speaker 1: That would've been the worst.

560
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:54,660
Speaker 0: - It was confirmed.

561
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,099
Speaker 1: - We would've had to like start bribing him.

562
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,820
Speaker 0: - See, the only thing that wasn't confirmed was I had not bought his plane tickets yet.

563
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,960
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but you know, it could've fallen through.

564
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
Speaker 0: - That could've fallen through.

565
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,706
Speaker 1: - It wasn't 100% locked in.

566
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,720
Speaker 0: - If that had fallen through, it would've fallen through due to Expedia and not due to him not wanting to come.

567
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:14,799
Speaker 0: And we've got three of the Rooster Teeth guys.

568
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,178
Speaker 0: And we haven't, no one has announced it yet, so I'm not going to announce it.

569
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:20,959
Speaker 0: We have a musical act.

570
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:22,800
Speaker 1: - Oh, we should-- - It's pretty rockin'.

571
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,898
Speaker 1: - We should keep whatever secrets we are able to keep, I guess.

572
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,820
Speaker 0: - That is, we have one more secret.

573
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,378
Speaker 1: - I'll give you a hint.

574
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:33,980
Speaker 1: It is not a musical act that is performing at a PAX concert.

575
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,520
Speaker 1: - Well, well, well, well, the-- - At least not the Friday night concert.

576
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,260
Speaker 0: - Yes, not the Friday night one, but I could foresee a walk-on on Saturday.

577
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:49,340
Speaker 1: - Yes, but it's not, okay, it is not listed as being part of, officially a part of any of the PAX concerts.

578
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,959
Speaker 0: - No, it is not.

579
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,740
Speaker 0: In fact, while I'm sure that I've gotten this person a fancier badge, they had on their own--.

580
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,320
Speaker 1: - You gave away that it was one person.

581
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,680
Speaker 0: - I gave away that she is one person.

582
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,099
Speaker 1: - Uh-oh, you're giving me too many hints.

583
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,360
Speaker 0: - But I don't know if she prefers Kirk or Picard.

584
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:02,975
Speaker 0: - We'll see.

585
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:03,513
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

586
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,255
Speaker 1: - Anyway.

587
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,980
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we have one other secret.

588
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:15,039
Speaker 0: There is a video that will be screened at this that no one in the world, except for the people who made it, have seen before, and I'm not even going to say who made it.

589
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,880
Speaker 1: - I think that there may be another, there may be multiple opportunities to see this video at PAX.

590
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,118
Speaker 1: - There will be at least two.

591
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,540
Speaker 1: - But you're probably not gonna see it anywhere but PAX, at least not for a while.

592
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:33,147
Speaker 0: - I would suggest you come to the PAX Late Show and then go to the panel where they will screen the same video and spoil it.

593
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,780
Speaker 1: - Actually, isn't the PAX Late Show going to be recorded and then put on the internets in video form?

594
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:48,200
Speaker 0: - It is going to be recorded Friday night and it should be streamed out, I'm working on the final details of that, Saturday night.

595
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:56,712
Speaker 1: - So won't they be, people at home who are not at PAX be able to see this video and the rest of the Late Show and the musical act on Saturday night on the internet for free?

596
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:04,940
Speaker 0: - For the first time ever it looks like if you did not get to attend PAX, you will get to attend at least one PAX event from the comfort of your own home.

597
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,419
Speaker 1: - It will not be live but it will be slightly delayed and you will not have to buy a DVD, so how about that?

598
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,839
Speaker 0: - So we've both at least now finally seen the Scott Pilgrim movie.

599
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,400
Speaker 1: - Oh yeah we have, and it's a movie.

600
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,280
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I still, I have no complaints about it.

601
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,220
Speaker 0: to be perfectly honest, we're not gonna spoil anything yet but this is kind of our review of the movie 'cause we needed a Thursday episode.

602
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,140
Speaker 1: - All right well you know, my general thoughts, I still like the book better.

603
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:34,864
Speaker 1: - Of course

604
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:52,640
Speaker 0: the comic was better, the comic was much more complex, it dealt with more issues, it dealt with them more elegantly, but at the same time the fact that they were able to condense all those books into one movie without making it feel rushed or feel like it left out something huge was amazing to me.

605
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,380
Speaker 1: - It definitely didn't leave out anything huge, I think the only problems I really had with it were--.

606
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:03,359
Speaker 0: - It simplified the theme and of course they had to not develop really any of the side characters, there's no way they could've.

607
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,820
Speaker 1: - You know the things that I like most are the side characters, right?

608
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:08,697
Speaker 1: And you know the thing is--.

609
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,900
Speaker 0: - Well especially Kim Pine.

610
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,440
Speaker 1: - Yeah in the movie, right, it really, as soon as the fights start, it's pretty much all fights.

611
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:26,659
Speaker 1: Whereas in the book it's fight, chill, fight, chill, fight, and the chill parts are so much better than the fight parts, but the movie was just a big chill in the beginning, which is the best part of the movie.

612
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:38,200
Speaker 1: But then it was fight with a little tiny bit of chill, but not enough, and then there wasn't really much between the fights, there was actually some during the fights, especially the first fight, you got all the action in the balcony, right?

613
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:51,199
Speaker 1: But it felt like the movie just fell down and became all fights, which were well choreographed, they weren't the best fights ever, but they were still damn good and excellent and fun to watch.

614
00:31:51,703 --> 00:32:00,760
Speaker 1: But for me to say, oh man, this movie was awesome, it would have had to have less on the fight and more on the hanging out in Toronto kind of action.

615
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,600
Speaker 0: - Yep, but at the same time, could you fit that into a movie, it would have had to have been like Lord of the Rings.

616
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Speaker 1: like a trilogy, maybe like two fights per, but the thing is, we now know that would have been a financially infeasible.

617
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:25,519
Speaker 0: - I am kind of sad how poorly the movie's doing, but at the same time, I have this expectation that the long-term franchise of comic movie game combined is gonna make bank.

618
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:34,236
Speaker 1: - Yeah, people have pointed out though, that you look at this compared to some other movies and it's like, ah, it's not doing well, ah, but you know what?

619
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:44,460
Speaker 1: Compared to the other movies the guy did, the Shaun of the Dead and the Hot Fuzz, and the Hot Fuzz is pretty great, this is doing better than those, at least opening weekend numbers.

620
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,299
Speaker 0: - Now I wonder how much of that is Michael Cera drawing hipsters in versus Scott Pilgrim people going in.

621
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,020
Speaker 1: - I think it's a tough call because Shaun of the Dead, like how many screens was it on, right?

622
00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:01,276
Speaker 1: Versus, you know, and the thing is, Scott Pilgrim's actually not really on enough screens, they said it was only on 2,000-ish, whereas usually a movie will be on 3,000-ish.

623
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,780
Speaker 0: - Well I noticed something and I was asking some people, they seem to have only marketed it in major cities.

624
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,779
Speaker 0: Like in New York.

625
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,100
Speaker 1: - I thought the marketing was crazy because I see it fucking everywhere I go.

626
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,420
Speaker 0: - Every cab, every bus, every bus stop in the subway.

627
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:19,657
Speaker 0: I passed like four Scott Pilgrim posters on my way to work.

628
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:27,717
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but we went to the movie theater in the city and it wasn't full, and it was only in one screen and it wasn't the biggest theater either.

629
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,700
Speaker 0: - No, we went to see it-- - And we wanted to see like prime time, like Friday night.

630
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,300
Speaker 0: - We went to see it in Philly, like Matt and A showing, we were basically the only people in the theater.

631
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:44,000
Speaker 1: - Yeah, the thing is, I think the problem was they heavily marketed it in the major cities and people outside the major cities are saying that they didn't see any marketing.

632
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:48,860
Speaker 1: So in the cities though, they had so many preview screenings.

633
00:33:49,082 --> 00:33:54,680
Speaker 1: I think everyone saw the preview screenings and nobody went to pay for the screenings afterwards.

634
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:02,239
Speaker 0: - I mean, remember there was that contest from Midtown Comics, which I won, so I went and independently, like almost all our friends got tickets to a screening.

635
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:09,179
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, a lot, like a whole, almost everyone that I know on the internets saw some preview screening.

636
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,520
Speaker 1: There were very few people who, I mean, a lot of people wanted to see it again, but that wasn't a majority, it was a minority.

637
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:19,900
Speaker 1: And like, of the people I know who have seen it, most of them saw a preview screening.

638
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,460
Speaker 0: - Yep, however, most people I've met who saw it thought it was fucking awesome.

639
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:29,379
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, I'm not hearing a lot of people who saw it say it was no good, which is usually the sign of a cult movie, right?

640
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:34,600
Speaker 1: A movie where the people who've seen it go, oh man, that's the best, and other people just haven't seen it, you know?

641
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,777
Speaker 1: There's not really a lot of haters.

642
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:42,699
Speaker 0: - Though at the same time, there are a lot of haters, but they're weird, they're all haters of the generation that spawned the movie.

643
00:34:44,244 --> 00:34:48,916
Speaker 0: It's becoming like a battleground of our parents' generation trying to tell us how stupid we are.

644
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:54,880
Speaker 1: - I don't know, the other thing about the movie is that, you know, in the book, best character, Kim Pine.

645
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,040
Speaker 0: - Movie, Wallace.

646
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:08,540
Speaker 1: - Yeah, well, the thing is, you know, Wallace, I mean, in the book, he was still the second best, but in the movie, he was the number one best, and then actually, right, characters that I didn't give two shit, not even one shit about in the book.

647
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,077
Speaker 0: - Well, like Julie.

648
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,640
Speaker 1: - Like Julie and Scott's sister in the movie, so awesome.

649
00:35:12,922 --> 00:35:13,478
Speaker 1: Like, the best.

650
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:18,600
Speaker 1: Like, they should've just made like, oh, you know, like Scott, sister, and Julie the movie.

651
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:19,620
Speaker 1: That would've been so much better.

652
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,839
Speaker 0: - I would watch that spinoff.

653
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,298
Speaker 1: - I would watch that 10 times.

654
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:26,973
Speaker 0: - The only line that was lacking was, no one yelled, "Smash her horsey

655
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:27,316
Speaker 0: face."

656
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:31,195
Speaker 0: (laughing) - And then the thing is, Kim Pine in the movie, eh.

657
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,020
Speaker 0: - She was good, she served the purpose very well.

658
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,020
Speaker 1: - But it wasn't even close, right?

659
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,420
Speaker 1: - Well, because-- - Whereas you look, Wallace in the movie was definitely very close to the Wallace in the book.

660
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,700
Speaker 0: - The best Wallace scene is that second text message.

661
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,399
Speaker 1: How does he do that?

662
00:35:45,642 --> 00:35:47,398
Speaker 1: (laughing) - That was pretty good, I don't know.

663
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:51,158
Speaker 1: I mostly liked the, you know, the drunken Wallace.

664
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,860
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and the-- - It was actually, you know, and the thing is, it wasn't just the scenes where he was making outward jokes.

665
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,240
Speaker 1: Like, if you looked, like, I saw like, quite a few, he had some really good, like, background action.

666
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,817
Speaker 1: Like, he would like, he sat at the bar once and just sorta like, fingered the bartender, like, come on.

667
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,316
Speaker 0: - Yup.

668
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,839
Speaker 1: (laughing) - But it's like, so it's not even in focus and he's making the funnies.

669
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,800
Speaker 0: - But there was a lot of that in the background.

670
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,420
Speaker 1: - I learned after the movie that, you know, that guy is actually Macaulay Culkin's brother, which is kinda crazy.

671
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,959
Speaker 0: - Wow, I did not know that.

672
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,120
Speaker 1: - Yeah, Scott Wallace is Macaulay Culkin's brother.

673
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:23,578
Speaker 1: - Huh.

674
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,820
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and he's really good at acting.

675
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,618
Speaker 1: It's like, whoa, look at that.

676
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:35,639
Speaker 0: - One big difference, and some people have complained about it, some people haven't, though, and it kinda falls into the fact that they had to narrow the focus of all the side characters.

677
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:48,140
Speaker 0: This was real, the movie's story is really just the story of Scott Pilgrim realizing the mistakes of his past and becoming an adult and fixing all the problems that he himself had caused.

678
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,939
Speaker 1: - Well, it's also the story of Knives Chow.

679
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,220
Speaker 1: - Is it really?

680
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,840
Speaker 1: - It's more the story of Knives Chow than it is the story of Ramona.

681
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,880
Speaker 0: - But I think really it's the story of Scott Pilgrim and Knives Chow was his mistake.

682
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:07,760
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but you know, you saw, like, Knives Chow had a full plot arc with, you know, where she developed, whereas nobody else really--.

683
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,700
Speaker 0: - No, but she could have no resolution, and she could not advance as a character to her conclusion until Scott fixed everything.

684
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,140
Speaker 1: - No, she had pretty much advanced there at the end.

685
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,660
Speaker 1: - No, she advanced to becoming an evil ex effectively, but-- - That was fine, that was, you know.

686
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,360
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but she couldn't get past that without Scott.

687
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:24,800
Speaker 1: - Nah, she was like, it doesn't matter.

688
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:36,820
Speaker 1: The point is that every other side character, you know, every other character who developed in any way either developed because they got killed and turned into a bunch of coins, or they were Knives Chow or Scott Pilgrim.

689
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,860
Speaker 0: - I guess it's more that the story of this movie, which it kind of, because it was a movie, it had to be succinct.

690
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:45,220
Speaker 0: It started with the Knives thing, and it brought that full circle with Nega Scott in the end and everything.

691
00:37:45,861 --> 00:37:49,279
Speaker 1: - Yeah, well, I mean, Nega Scott didn't even really, he was just a joke in the movie.

692
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,340
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but the Nega Ninja.

693
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,680
Speaker 1: - Yeah, okay.

694
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,780
Speaker 0: - That was good, it brought it full circle.

695
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,088
Speaker 1: - It did.

696
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,840
Speaker 0: - And it brought that DDR game in the beginning back full circle.

697
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,260
Speaker 1: - Yeah, we should play the DDR game.

698
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,900
Speaker 0: - I want that game, oh my God.

699
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,760
Speaker 1: - Of course, it doesn't beat our mosh-mosh revolution.

700
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,440
Speaker 0: - No, but if that were an arcade game, I would play the fuck out of that game.

701
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,060
Speaker 1: - I would also play the fuck, but that game couldn't really work.

702
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:09,559
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it could.

703
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,379
Speaker 1: - I don't know.

704
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:10,878
Speaker 0: - It could work.

705
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:11,939
Speaker 1: - It'd be tough.

706
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:12,959
Speaker 0: - It could easily work.

707
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:13,880
Speaker 1: DancePad plus Kinect.

708
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,660
Speaker 1: - It would actually be like an Xbox Kinect game.

709
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,760
Speaker 0: - Yeah, DancePad plus Kinect.

710
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,420
Speaker 1: - It wouldn't be so complete.

711
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,679
Speaker 0: - No, you know how to make it complete?

712
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,280
Speaker 0: Arcade machine.

713
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,660
Speaker 1: - It wouldn't be so precise.

714
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,297
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it could be.

715
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,060
Speaker 1: - It couldn't be.

716
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,058
Speaker 0: - It's better now, it could be.

717
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,760
Speaker 1: - Oh, right, you were in the shore.

718
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,459
Speaker 1: - Give it some years.

719
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,127
Speaker 0: - You didn't play.

720
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:29,120
Speaker 0: Tanks, Tanks, Tanks.

721
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,280
Speaker 1: - What's Tanks, Tanks, Tanks?

722
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,419
Speaker 0: - It's the new arcade game.

723
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,098
Speaker 1: - Full of tanks?

724
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,453
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

725
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,560
Speaker 1: - Is it like battle tanks?

726
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,360
Speaker 0: - I'll show you a picture.

727
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,219
Speaker 1: - Is it just like BZ Tank in a box?

728
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,238
Speaker 0: - It's versus tanks.

729
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:39,692
Speaker 1: - Okay, combat.

730
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,980
Speaker 0: - But it has a camera and it takes your picture.

731
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,000
Speaker 1: My picture was-- - So does Mario Kart arcade.

732
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,140
Speaker 0: - My picture was my middle finger.

733
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,099
Speaker 1: - That's awesome.

734
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,311
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

735
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,739
Speaker 1: - Should have made it your penis.

736
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:51,540
Speaker 1: Drawing off a penis and hold it up in front of the camera.

737
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,760
Speaker 0: - So, we're gonna spoil stuff from this point forward.

738
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,259
Speaker 0: - We already did.

739
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,780
Speaker 0: - We're gonna spoil stuff for real, possibly.

740
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:04,020
Speaker 0: So, if you haven't seen the movie yet or read the comic, stop listening and go do both.

741
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:04,997
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I don't know.

742
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,058
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but the movie at least--.

743
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,139
Speaker 1: - Actually, if you can see the movie at this point, it probably won't be long before you can get the Dollar Theater.

744
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,240
Speaker 1: - But the movie definitely-- - Money saving tips.

745
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:23,019
Speaker 0: - Notice how the moral at the end was definitely, it was Scott overcoming his own bullshit and that was the primary story.

746
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:29,939
Speaker 0: And in the comic, that still was the primary story, but it was much more complex and much more elegantly done.

747
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,539
Speaker 0: - And all the other characters had similar arcs.

748
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,760
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, if you look at the, it's a lot more like an Urasawa comic, right?

749
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:45,400
Speaker 1: Where, okay, Monster is about this one guy, but we're actually gonna split off and tell you full stories about other guys.

750
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,079
Speaker 0: - Yep, Monster and every single character you meet gets their whole story.

751
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,000
Speaker 1: - Right, but in, so in the Scott Pilgrim comic, in six volumes, you get, not everyone has a story.

752
00:39:54,140 --> 00:40:04,051
Speaker 1: I mean, Julie really doesn't do much, but you got Envy, you got Kim Pine, you got some Wallace, you got all sorts of action going on with all sorts of characters and they all do stuff.

753
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:16,773
Speaker 1: But in the movie, they basically shrunk it not by leaving out stuff like major parts, but by leaving out characters and basically turning them into side people.

754
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,479
Speaker 1: Whereas before, they were sort of little less than side people.

755
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:29,716
Speaker 0: - But still, I mean, look at the progression of Scott, say, in the comic, where it's, he is over, it's almost like him fighting the evil.

756
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:39,959
Speaker 0: exes is an extension of him as a boyfriend or a potential mate, kind of overcoming the memory of previous people the person had dated.

757
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:45,759
Speaker 0: You have to beat every ex-boyfriend of anyone you're going to date before you can truly date them.

758
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:47,999
Speaker 0: That's kind of something everyone has to do in a way.

759
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:55,040
Speaker 0: But at the same time, he was generating all of his own evil exes and didn't even realize it.

760
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,398
Speaker 0: And the comic got into that really well.

761
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,959
Speaker 0: Remember at the end where they kind of flash back to show you what all those relationships were really like?

762
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,020
Speaker 0: His memory versus reality?

763
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:12,940
Speaker 1: - Yeah, they didn't really, that's one thing they totally left out, at least for Scott, is the whole fact that he just didn't remember things at all in the comic.

764
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:15,267
Speaker 1: And that was like a major thing, was like, he'd be like, "I don't

765
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:15,571
Speaker 1: remember.".

766
00:41:16,805 --> 00:41:17,857
Speaker 1: You're like, "Do you even know that person's

767
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:18,019
Speaker 1: name?".

768
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:19,692
Speaker 1: "Uh,

769
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:19,979
Speaker 1: yeah.".

770
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,960
Speaker 1: And he was like me, he didn't remember anything.

771
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,499
Speaker 1: So in the movie, they didn't have any of that.

772
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,360
Speaker 0: - Now I do think, however, the movie hinted at that.

773
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,780
Speaker 0: The movie definitely pointed out everything from the comic.

774
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:37,060
Speaker 0: Like every tiny little detail was there and it would allude to, every moment of it was referencing the comic.

775
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,980
Speaker 1: - It's like they had a plate of bacon but they didn't actually make the bacon joke.

776
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,220
Speaker 0: - But they didn't make the mistake that superhero movies often make, where they'll focus on stupid details and then make them important.

777
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:53,239
Speaker 1: But the other thing is, some of the stuff that they put in there that you might have thought was out of nowhere really wasn't.

778
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,199
Speaker 1: Like look at the part where the Seinfeld joke, right?

779
00:41:56,363 --> 00:42:06,800
Speaker 1: If you look in the comic, right before they make that Seinfeld joke, there was actually some live audience laugh track in the comic, right at that spot.

780
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,177
Speaker 1: So you can't be like, "Oh, they just tossed that in from

781
00:42:10,217 --> 00:42:10,420
Speaker 1: nowhere.".

782
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,020
Speaker 1: It's like, well, no, really, look, you can actually see that was in the comic.

783
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,698
Speaker 0: - It was a movie where, much like to use an anime reference, "Utenna,".

784
00:42:17,062 --> 00:42:18,139
Speaker 0: everything is there for a reason.

785
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:26,419
Speaker 0: - 'Cause like you point out, people are doing stuff in the background, like Kim does things and Wallace does things and they're not the focus, you might not even notice it.

786
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,020
Speaker 1: like hanging out on the side, like diddling around with the audio cables and shit.

787
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,207
Speaker 0: - Yup.

788
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,220
Speaker 1: - You know, they put in a lot of stuff.

789
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:37,019
Speaker 1: that was just, you know, they only had two hours, actually 30 minutes longer than most movies.

790
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,140
Speaker 0: - But I note, and everyone says this, the movie didn't feel like it was two hours long.

791
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:42,138
Speaker 0: It just flew by.

792
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,139
Speaker 1: - Nah, it didn't feel, you know, it felt a little bit, it felt like, you know, a regular movie length, plus a little bit.

793
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,327
Speaker 1: - But I think it was because-- - But it didn't feel long, like, you know, a long movie feels.

794
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:56,560
Speaker 0: - Notice how the transitions were very comicky, instead of like the Hulk movie, where they tried to make it like comic frames and it just was terrible.

795
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,999
Speaker 1: - I never watched, I don't know what movie that-- - Watch it on YouTube.

796
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,180
Speaker 0: But look at Scott Pilgrim.

797
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:05,556
Speaker 0: Instead of doing something meta, like with comic frames or something, what do they do?

798
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:07,520
Speaker 0: Scene changes were just immediate.

799
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,558
Speaker 0: Like suddenly it's a different scene.

800
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:13,939
Speaker 0: No kind of buildup or establishing shot, just bam, we're here, bam, we're here.

801
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:16,536
Speaker 0: Scott's daydreaming, now we're here, now we're here, now we're doing this.

802
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,960
Speaker 0: They like cut out all the possible filler and just jumped from scene to scene to scene, breakneck all the way to the end.

803
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,460
Speaker 1: - Yeah, sometimes it was like they would jump so fast, you'd be like, whoa, whoa, where are we going?

804
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,599
Speaker 0: - I have to pee on her.

805
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:30,957
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you do.

806
00:43:32,962 --> 00:43:34,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, what else can we say?

807
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,519
Speaker 1: Oh, let's talk about the music, right?

808
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:39,979
Speaker 1: So the thing is, when I was watching the movie, I was like, well, what's this music gonna be like?

809
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,040
Speaker 1: 'Cause you, right?

810
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,720
Speaker 0: - I like the music.

811
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,858
Speaker 1: - Well, here's the thing, right?

812
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,397
Speaker 0: - Truck, truck, truck, that's been in my head for like a week.

813
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
Speaker 1: - The Garbage Truck song is good.

814
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,979
Speaker 0: - That's been in my head, I can't get it out.

815
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:53,240
Speaker 1: - The song that I liked the most, I think, was the Clash of Demonhead song.

816
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,320
Speaker 0: - Yes, Envy's song.

817
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,776
Speaker 0: ♪ Hello, my friend.

818
00:43:55,776 --> 00:43:56,080
Speaker 0: ♪.

819
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,940
Speaker 1: - And you know, the songs that, you know, Sex Bob-Omb sang, they were all right.

820
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,560
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but Sex Bob-Omb is not supposed to be good.

821
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,840
Speaker 0: That was kind of the moral of the comic, that they're not good.

822
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:12,900
Speaker 1: - I went and I got the OST on the Pirate Bays, of course, right, and I listened to it, and you know, the Sex Bob-Omb songs, they were still all right.

823
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:15,020
Speaker 1: And the Envy song was still really great.

824
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,699
Speaker 1: But every other song on this OST is like, ugh.

825
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,820
Speaker 1: Except, I guess there's a Rolling Stones song on there, but it's like, okay, whatever, big deal.

826
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,900
Speaker 0: - But I did notice in the credits, at least, like all the songs that Michael Cero sang, he really did sing.

827
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,400
Speaker 1: - Yeah, the other thing I noticed, though, is that the OST actually has all the Sex Bob-Omb songs.

828
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,560
Speaker 1: I think they were written by Beck, right?

829
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,599
Speaker 1: Like, they're his songs, they had him do it.

830
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,200
Speaker 1: So they're on there twice, you know, once the movie version, once the Beck version.

831
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:40,404
Speaker 1: - Ah.

832
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,999
Speaker 1: - And that makes me not wanna pay for it, 'cause Beck is a Scientologist jerk.

833
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,017
Speaker 1: - All right, yeah.

834
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,400
Speaker 1: - Even though I like his music, he sucks.

835
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,678
Speaker 0: - I always forget about that.

836
00:44:48,960 --> 00:45:03,239
Speaker 1: - See, the thing is, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, because everything I've read about evil Scientology-- - Oh, if you're rich-- - Is that the famous people never actually see any of the evil stuff, and they have no idea it's going on, and I'm sure he would probably disapprove of it if he knew about it, but he's basically kept in the dark.

837
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,840
Speaker 1: You know, he doesn't know about, you know, Lisa McPherson or the Sea Org or any of that shit.

838
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,379
Speaker 1: He doesn't see it, it's totally hidden.

839
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:14,420
Speaker 1: And he only goes to the celebrity Scientology center, where everything is like a palace and is great.

840
00:45:14,981 --> 00:45:21,158
Speaker 1: So, you know, he just doesn't know that's going on, but that doesn't excuse him not reading the internets and seeing all the evil things.

841
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,879
Speaker 0: - People like that don't, though, I don't think they do.

842
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,740
Speaker 0: I don't think they touch reality that much.

843
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,336
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I don't know.

844
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:33,520
Speaker 1: But regardless, you know, don't give any money to that guy, even though I can't lie and say I don't like his music, 'cause it's good.

845
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,000
Speaker 1: - I mean, Tom Cruise, I mean, some of his movies, really good.

846
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:36,575
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

847
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:37,679
Speaker 1: - All right.

848
00:45:38,141 --> 00:45:42,918
Speaker 0: - I liked all the little touches, though, like when Kim is just flipping him off.

849
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,260
Speaker 1: (laughing) - Yeah.

850
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,940
Speaker 0: - And you're right about the Wallace drunk scenes, though.

851
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,099
Speaker 0: Like, when he comes in, he's like, guess who's drunk?

852
00:45:51,884 --> 00:45:52,780
Speaker 0: That was beautiful.

853
00:45:52,900 --> 00:46:03,519
Speaker 1: That scene was-- - Pretty much every, we should just make the Wallace movie, just all Wallace scenes, you know, every frame where he's in the shot, even if he's on the side of the shot or in the back.

854
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:03,807
Speaker 0: - Yep.

855
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,500
Speaker 1: - Just cut and paste and make that into a YouTube.

856
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,579
Speaker 1: - When he like slides in with the skateboard.

857
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,159
Speaker 1: - Yep.

858
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:08,654
Speaker 0: - Here you go.

859
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:11,710
Speaker 0: - Let's see.

860
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:14,730
Speaker 0: - Also, one of my favorite moments was the first fight.

861
00:46:15,312 --> 00:46:22,490
Speaker 0: I thought the comedic timing of that was very good, but then, when they actually did the Bollywood kind of song with the demon hipster chick.

862
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,269
Speaker 1: - Yeah, what fight did you think was your favorite?

863
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:34,089
Speaker 0: - See, the first one I liked because it had the I skimmed it and the demon hipster chick Bollywood number.

864
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:41,409
Speaker 0: Second one was good just because the timing of Lucas Lee, like with the girls watching and the, and his eyes.

865
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,668
Speaker 0: - I don't know, I liked them all.

866
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,090
Speaker 0: Clashy demon head was just fucking awesome.

867
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:55,830
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I think that, you know, the first one was kind of fun because it was the first one and it had all this, you know, crowd stuff going on and the, you know, the upstairs and everything.

868
00:46:56,771 --> 00:47:00,090
Speaker 1: The second one was, which was the second one again?

869
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:00,969
Speaker 1: All right, Lucas Lee.

870
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:07,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that one I definitely thought was the most comedic, not in terms of the fight part, but in terms of just Lucas Lee was so awesome.

871
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,030
Speaker 0: - He was, he's just like, hey, what's up?

872
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:09,688
Speaker 0: He seems nice.

873
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:21,570
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it was like, you know, for the comedy of the dialogue in the Lucas Lee area was amazing, but I think I would have to pick the, the fight with the vegan as terms of the fight action.

874
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,189
Speaker 0: - Because of the high five with the vegan police as they're leaving.

875
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:25,499
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

876
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:29,750
Speaker 0: - That was go, the audience at the pre-screening lost their shit when they high fived.

877
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,188
Speaker 1: - Really?

878
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:30,520
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

879
00:47:32,512 --> 00:47:34,630
Speaker 0: The weakest fight I think was honestly the lesbian one.

880
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,330
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I definitely, I think so too.

881
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:41,106
Speaker 0: - The build up was good and the character was good, but they really just like, oh, we gotta get this out of the way, bam, doop.

882
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,550
Speaker 1: - Actually, I also wasn't a big fan of the twins.

883
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:45,890
Speaker 1: I mean, the music was good.

884
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,790
Speaker 0: - The scene was good, but the twins were boring.

885
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,790
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it was like, okay, you just sort of, you know, you didn't even talk about the twins.

886
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:55,290
Speaker 1: I mean, remember the twins in the comic had the fucking super robot fight.

887
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:55,909
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

888
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,430
Speaker 0: - Come on, super robot fight.

889
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,370
Speaker 1: Instead we got basically digital Pokemans.

890
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,270
Speaker 1: - You know what we got?

891
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:00,888
Speaker 1: - And not Digimans.

892
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,089
Speaker 0: - We got what the Avatar movie should have looked like.

893
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:06,010
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I would, they should have had the super robot fight instead.

894
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:08,249
Speaker 1: That would have been way so awesome.

895
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,050
Speaker 1: Thing is, I think it might have taken people out of the movie a little bit if they were actually super robots.

896
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:12,968
Speaker 0: - I did think it was, it was neat.

897
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,910
Speaker 1: - Because the movie wasn't, you know, to have a super giant robot, you have to zoom out, right?

898
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,430
Speaker 1: But most of the movie was very in.

899
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,870
Speaker 1: - It was very closed, there wasn't a lot of openness.

900
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,150
Speaker 1: Even in the snow, everything was closed.

901
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,530
Speaker 1: You had trees around, you had the fences on the rails of the stairs.

902
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,110
Speaker 0: - I did though, I liked what they did.

903
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:37,649
Speaker 1: - You're in the small apartment, you're in the, you know, in the coffee shop, you're in, they didn't do a lot of, they didn't even do a lot of Toronto street action.

904
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,650
Speaker 1: - They were out on the, out on the street outside of the apartment, you know?

905
00:48:43,031 --> 00:48:45,710
Speaker 1: They didn't do the walking up and down the street situation.

906
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,910
Speaker 0: - I did like what they did with the Gideon fight and how it happened twice.

907
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:49,910
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it was all right.

908
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:53,690
Speaker 0: - 'Cause it let them kind of go in two different directions because, you know, love, all right.

909
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,908
Speaker 1: - Well, if they would have gotten into like the glow and shit, it would have totally not made sense to people.

910
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,410
Speaker 1: It wouldn't, you know, you couldn't get that across easily and people would have just been like, what the fuck?

911
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:01,551
Speaker 1: - I

912
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:16,509
Speaker 0: still think, I gotta ask Brian Lee O'Malley, look at the way in the comic, at least at the end, the thing, I'm gonna try to not really spoil the comic for people who only saw the movie, the thing with the people hanging, didn't that not look just like the Utena thing hanging?

913
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:17,550
Speaker 1: - I don't know.

914
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:18,850
Speaker 0: - I'll show you all the frames.

915
00:49:19,212 --> 00:49:20,850
Speaker 0: I think there was some Utena inspiration there.

916
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:32,109
Speaker 1: - I actually read an interview with him where he basically, he was like, yeah, when we gave the option to this movie, I expected it to suck and I, you know, I just wanted some monies, but then, hey.

917
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:33,364
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

918
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:38,069
Speaker 1: - It's like he didn't, you know, he let them option it and, you know, so he can get some monies and he didn't care really.

919
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,609
Speaker 1: He, you know, expected it to not be good because that's how these things go.

920
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:45,069
Speaker 1: But then when it actually was good, he was like, oh, well, all the better.

921
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:48,370
Speaker 1: You know, I wonder how he, you know, feels about the box.

922
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:50,389
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's not hurting his wallet that much.

923
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:54,010
Speaker 0: - But it was good, you know, the first Gideon fight when they're like, what's the password?

924
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:54,870
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

925
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,630
Speaker 0: - That was great.

926
00:49:57,051 --> 00:50:01,228
Speaker 0: - And then I like how they actually played the entire scene out again the second time.

927
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:02,790
Speaker 1: - Yeah, with the passwords.

928
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,769
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but then just so you could walk in and be like, your music sucks, your club sucks, you sucked, let's go.

929
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,749
Speaker 0: I liked that, I liked that directness.

930
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,909
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it was very good.

931
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:15,710
Speaker 1: Plus, you know, it didn't, it took less time to be more direct like that.

932
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,550
Speaker 0: - Of course, at the same time, it means I lost.

933
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:19,870
Speaker 0: one of my other favorite parts of the comic is the whole thing with the cat.

934
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:21,790
Speaker 1: - Oh, the cat.

935
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,050
Speaker 0: - Just not, just at the end, when he's like, you were in the cat, you were in the cat.

936
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,650
Speaker 0: He's like, cat, the fuck you talking about?

937
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,149
Speaker 0: Cat's name was Gideon, then Ramona's like, what?

938
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,690
Speaker 1: - Was the cat even in the movie at all, period?

939
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,750
Speaker 1: - Yeah, they should've just had the cat like in the background in Ramona's apartment or something.

940
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,768
Speaker 0: - If it was, I didn't notice it.

941
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:40,989
Speaker 1: - Like there should've been just like, you know, a dish of cat food with Gideon on it.

942
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,330
Speaker 0: - Maybe there was and I didn't notice.

943
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,429
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you know, they gotta have something like that.

944
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:48,090
Speaker 0: - But it's amazing just how faithful it was to the comic, at least like stylistically.

945
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:54,510
Speaker 0: Like when they make out the first time, how the pose of their making out is the exact frame from the comic.

946
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:55,230
Speaker 1: - Oh, absolutely.

947
00:50:56,171 --> 00:51:02,230
Speaker 1: The other thing is that, you know, people seem to get this impression that Scott Pilgrim is like all video game references, right?

948
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:05,310
Speaker 1: And the thing is, the comic really isn't that much.

949
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,470
Speaker 1: There's a couple, you know?

950
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:08,590
Speaker 1: I mean, the first one isn't even for many pages.

951
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:13,330
Speaker 1: - Well, I'd say it is, but it's-- - But if you watch the movie and you haven't read the comic, it's just video game references.

952
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,250
Speaker 1: I mean, there's some non-video game references, but it's constant video game references.

953
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,709
Speaker 0: - A lot of the music references and everything were there too.

954
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:19,668
Speaker 0: They're just-- - Yeah.

955
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,569
Speaker 1: Seinfeld references, you know.

956
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,849
Speaker 0: - The references in Scott Pilgrim-- - Anime, manga references.

957
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:30,469
Speaker 0: - Both comic and movie are only there if you are knowledgeable about the subject matter they are referencing.

958
00:51:31,111 --> 00:51:33,209
Speaker 0: They are non-obvious unless you know.

959
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:37,590
Speaker 0: And the other thing is-- - I mean, who knows Clash of Demon Head, but crazy gamers.

960
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:47,170
Speaker 1: - The other thing, though, is that I think that people, like, they might get some video game references, but not others.

961
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,549
Speaker 1: Like, I don't think a lot of people have played and know River City Ransom.

962
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,849
Speaker 1: I think it's not nearly enough, you know?

963
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:59,129
Speaker 1: So, like, if you actually watch that, like, Kim Pine animation on AdultSwim.com, it's just River City Ransom.

964
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:00,870
Speaker 1: That's all it is, right?

965
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,165
Speaker 1: And I don't think people know River City Ransom, at least not enough.

966
00:52:05,032 --> 00:52:09,249
Speaker 1: And River City Ransom is the one video game that Scott Pilgrim references more than any other.

967
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:10,417
Speaker 0: - Yes, Simon.

968
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:11,270
Speaker 0: - By a lot.

969
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,869
Speaker 0: - It begins with a reference to it.

970
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:17,030
Speaker 1: - I know, but people don't know River City Ransom.

971
00:52:17,872 --> 00:52:20,490
Speaker 1: So, you know, like the one-up, they understand one-up.

972
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,085
Speaker 1: You know, they understand DDR.

973
00:52:22,732 --> 00:52:26,770
Speaker 1: They understand, you know, fighting games, and, you know, Street Fighter Versus.

974
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:29,850
Speaker 1: But they don't understand River City Ransom.

975
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:32,509
Speaker 1: So, they gotta, and not enough people do.

976
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,173
Speaker 0: - The thing is, it's a movie that's enjoyable enough to where.

977
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,090
Speaker 0: I'm glad I saw it twice.

978
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,647
Speaker 0: - Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

979
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,370
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't know if I need to see it twice.

980
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:42,790
Speaker 1: There's plenty of other movies I can see twice.

981
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:48,310
Speaker 0: - It was worth it, mostly so I could talk about it with people right after they saw it, because I couldn't say anything about it, I mean.

982
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:49,030
Speaker 1: - Yeah, right.

983
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:50,930
Speaker 1: Well, I'm glad I saw it.

984
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,148
Speaker 1: I don't know if I paid too much.

985
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:56,910
Speaker 1: It feels more like something that is, you know, this is definitely, it's like a Firefly situation, right?

986
00:52:56,971 --> 00:52:58,949
Speaker 1: All the nerds like it, and then they sell DVDs.

987
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,970
Speaker 0: - I'll qualify all my feelings.

988
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,787
Speaker 0: I've said repeatedly, I have zero complaints about the movie.

989
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:14,309
Speaker 0: And that is true, because everything I could complain about in the movie, the loss of the complexity of the side characters, all those things, it would have been impossible to make the movie and have those things.

990
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:19,629
Speaker 1: - Right, unless they made, you know, multiple movies, but that was financially infeasible, so there you go.

991
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:24,350
Speaker 0: - So for a movie, a single movie, I think it was as good as it could have possibly been.

992
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,570
Speaker 0: I don't think it could have been better.

993
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,750
Speaker 1: - It could have been a little better.

994
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:32,430
Speaker 1: What I would have done is I would have actually, I would have made it, I would have done blasphemy, right?

995
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,590
Speaker 1: I would have made it six evil exes instead of seven.

996
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:36,510
Speaker 0: - Cut out the lesbian?

997
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,610
Speaker 1: - Cut out either the lesbian or the twins, or maybe even both.

998
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:40,950
Speaker 0: - I would have cut out just the lesbian.

999
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,586
Speaker 1: - Yeah, either one, and then--.

1000
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,510
Speaker 0: - But notice they kept referencing the lesbian.

1001
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:46,988
Speaker 0: They had the lesbian poster up, they did the lesbian's joke.

1002
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,269
Speaker 1: - Yeah, lesbian, lesbian.

1003
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,488
Speaker 0: - He's like evil ex boyfriend, she's like evil exes.

1004
00:53:52,130 --> 00:54:00,000
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but you know, then I would have put in more just, you know, hanging around Toronto kind of action, you know, and robots.

1005
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,869
Speaker 0: - Now then the movie would have lost the frantic intensity that it had.

1006
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,530
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I didn't need the frantic intensity.

1007
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,710
Speaker 1: I didn't really, I wasn't, you know, I needed a break from all the fighting.

1008
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:09,530
Speaker 0: - See, I didn't want a break.

1009
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,350
Speaker 0: I just wanted steam, steam, steam.

1010
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:17,769
Speaker 1: - 'Cause the part of the movie that I enjoyed the most was the before even any fighting happened at all.

1011
00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:22,170
Speaker 1: So if they would, the movie, the whole movie would have just been that and there was no fighting.

1012
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,630
Speaker 1: Oh my God, even if it would diverge greatly from the comic.

1013
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,890
Speaker 0: - They could, in that case, they should have just made Scott Pilgrim the TV show.

1014
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:29,006
Speaker 1: - Oh my God.

1015
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:33,790
Speaker 0: - Just those people being sarcastic in Toronto.

1016
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,389
Speaker 1: - Oh, it would have been so much better.

1017
00:54:39,491 --> 00:54:40,387
Speaker 1: Animated, I'll take it.

1018
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:41,369
Speaker 0: - I would watch that.

1019
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,630
Speaker 1: - Oh, so much better.

1020
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,149
Speaker 0: - Ryan Lee O'Malley, get on that shit.

1021
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,350
Speaker 1: - Yeah, TV series, animated, just jerks in Toronto.

1022
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:49,227
Speaker 0: - They could call it that.

1023
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,990
Speaker 1: - Don't even make it like Scott Pelger.

1024
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:56,610
Speaker 1: Make it like Young Neil and make a whole bunch of new characters who were just a jerky and then have like old Geezer Wallace.

1025
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:00,068
Speaker 0: - What do you play?

1026
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,630
Speaker 0: - Hey, gay guys, come on my lawn.

1027
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,189
Speaker 0: - I think we're done.

1028
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:05,750
Speaker 1: - We're done.

1029
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:14,330
Speaker 0: - This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1030
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:19,450
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.
