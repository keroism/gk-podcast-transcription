1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,949
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday April 6th 2021.

2
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,278
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:18,090
Speaker 0: We are talking about JRPGs the genre.

4
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:19,619
Speaker 1: let's do this.

5
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:22,291
Speaker 0: So we didn't want to review the game.

6
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:30,423
Speaker 0: We just played and actually I'm looking at the Final seconds of this game, but we're playing another train game right now called 1828.

7
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:31,851
Speaker 1: Let's just become train nights.

8
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:33,139
Speaker 1: forget this geek nights business

9
00:00:34,142 --> 00:00:42,988
Speaker 0: I mean, I feel like a big reason why we're playing so many train games is because we're stuck inside at home all day while we're working and Like this website

10
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,600
Speaker 1: happened to come into existence at the exact right time

11
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:58,720
Speaker 0: we happen to have a group of people who already knew the deal with train games and They really suit themselves to asynchronous play far more than a lot of other types of games for a lot of reasons We talked about in a recent episode on asynchronous play.

12
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:13,740
Speaker 0: So, you know, but all I want to say is if I guess it we could be a geek bite this 1828 one Intrigues me quite a bit and I think it's equal in my eyes now to 1817 in terms of want to play it again.

13
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:16,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, this 80 this is a good one.

14
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:18,499
Speaker 1: This 1828 I would recommend.

15
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:21,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I think the and well 12 reviewed at some point.

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,700
Speaker 0: We just don't want to do a million train reviews all in a row and I've got to play it again.

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:40,520
Speaker 0: But the thing I'll say is that the sign one of the signs we've noticed of a good train game compared to a mediocre one Or just an okay one is if after the first play We all go whoa, and then the next time the same group of people play we play it radically differently.

18
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:43,490
Speaker 0: That's usually a sign that it's one that's got some staying power.

19
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,440
Speaker 0: Mmm, if there's one like 1889 I like but every like second time I played it I did the exact same thing.

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:59,118
Speaker 0: I tried to do the first time just better third time fourth time every time it almost always goes the same basic way, but this one looks like it can go in a lot of different directions.

21
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,332
Speaker 0: and Like going back through my early moves in this game.

22
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:03,660
Speaker 0: What the fuck was wrong with rim?

23
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,364
Speaker 0: Why did he?

24
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:06,637
Speaker 0: why did he wait to par Michigan Central?

25
00:02:06,657 --> 00:02:07,260
Speaker 0: Like that was a mistake?

26
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,300
Speaker 1: This one I mean how I didn't understand what the I didn't realize the 8e wasn't just an eight train.

27
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:21,340
Speaker 0: I love how you looked at in a 3d and thought oh that D. Yeah, you understood the D. That's a big deal.

28
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:25,035
Speaker 0: We talked a lot about the D But at no point where you were like, why does that other train have any?

29
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:25,739
Speaker 0: I guess it's not.

30
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:25,940
Speaker 1: I did.

31
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,156
Speaker 1: I said why I thought to myself why is there an e that must mean something?

32
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:30,745
Speaker 1: and I'm like, yeah I'm not gonna look it up.

33
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:31,208
Speaker 1: Whatever.

34
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:34,753
Speaker 1: I'll just do play the game and then it's like oops Actually, it was a big deal.

35
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:35,459
Speaker 1: I messed it up.

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:45,616
Speaker 0: Well, not like the 1817. we played with the listener where I literally just forgot that outstanding market shares dropped stock price at the end of the SR in that one and made a catastrophic error.

37
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:50,280
Speaker 0: Yep, what I should have done is mutually shorted and that would have been fun.

38
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,932
Speaker 0: But instead I was like, oh, I'm fine.

39
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,120
Speaker 0: He can't rust any trains.

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,144
Speaker 0: This is gonna be fine.

41
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:57,036
Speaker 0: And then when the OR starts and I saw that stock price drop.

42
00:02:57,096 --> 00:03:00,378
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, yeah 1817 fuck.

43
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:06,124
Speaker 0: Anyway Anyway, there is a decent amount of gaming news But we're gonna start with.

44
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,033
Speaker 0: is that PAX East?

45
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:09,600
Speaker 0: this is officially announced.

46
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:13,013
Speaker 0: There is gonna be no PAX East this year as we assume.

47
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:13,635
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

48
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:14,940
Speaker 1: I didn't see that coming.

49
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:15,724
Speaker 1: Whoa, what a surprise.

50
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:16,931
Speaker 0: Better call James Randi.

51
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:22,936
Speaker 0: We got an Nostradamus here But uh, you're gonna need an Nostradamus to call James Randi.

52
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:25,746
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Rest in peace.

53
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,933
Speaker 0: You were a cool dude, but pexis.

54
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:34,907
Speaker 0: There's gonna be no pexis this year because April May probably June like.

55
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:43,013
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna speculate about the rest of the year in terms of like odds of a convention happening, but Spring and early summer is just off the table.

56
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:47,447
Speaker 0: Like it is too soon Like things there's things are still evolving.

57
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:51,720
Speaker 0: I applaud packs for making these decision and they have a statement that we'll just link to.

58
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:58,999
Speaker 0: But also they're gonna do another packs online because it actually went really well and whatever that looks like we're gonna be there for it.

59
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:00,737
Speaker 1: All right, sure.

60
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:02,809
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll do a new panel.

61
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,675
Speaker 0: I got I got a panel.

62
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:05,344
Speaker 0: I've been working on It's in the.

63
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:07,260
Speaker 0: I've actually I've done some research.

64
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,532
Speaker 0: I've got a little bit of data, but I got to get more.

65
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:11,020
Speaker 0: the problem is to get more data.

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,341
Speaker 0: You know what?

67
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:11,743
Speaker 0: I got to do.

68
00:04:11,763 --> 00:04:15,760
Speaker 0: I actually have to go record myself playing Team Fortress 2 with randos.

69
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:28,824
Speaker 0: Okay, like I literally need a few hours of footage of me earnestly trying to play Team Fortress 2 online against real people trying to win and I need to do it with every single character class.

70
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:33,904
Speaker 0: So I need like two hours of my own play for every character class as Data for this panel.

71
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:34,325
Speaker 0: Thankfully.

72
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:37,738
Speaker 0: I already have more than that for overwatch because that's almost all I play these days.

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,720
Speaker 0: But I look forward to a packs online, I think it's the right decision.

74
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:44,940
Speaker 0: We'll see if packs West happens.

75
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:56,340
Speaker 0: I think that's iffy because even if September like a miracle happens and the world is way safer My suspicion is it's gonna be too late to plan September cons, especially cons that involve big industry presence.

76
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:57,824
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

77
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:03,071
Speaker 0: I feel like packs unplugged is the first big Convention that has a chance of happening.

78
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:03,775
Speaker 0: that I would like

79
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:07,625
Speaker 1: it has a chance But I'm not even gonna give it a 50% chance No, but it's

80
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:11,668
Speaker 0: one where if I was in a casino when I saw those odds I might throw a little bit of money at it

81
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,517
Speaker 1: if you have to bet on one, right?

82
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:19,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like if the gate if you made a game and the game was okay.

83
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,999
Speaker 1: Here's a list of all packs is for the next three years.

84
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:28,039
Speaker 1: Right put a token on the first packs that will happen without going over.

85
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,160
Speaker 1: That's it's either that one or soon after is where it's either that or it's like.

86
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,012
Speaker 0: I don't even know about South because the whole Texas situation.

87
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:38,820
Speaker 0: so it might be East if it's not unplugged.

88
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:40,503
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

89
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:46,640
Speaker 1: It's like that's the area where the tokens car with the current odds are likely to lay, right?

90
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:48,387
Speaker 1: So yeah.

91
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:49,094
Speaker 0: Yep.

92
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:49,579
Speaker 0: All right.

93
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:57,551
Speaker 1: So III the horrible conferences existed our whole lives which is it had such a mystique like before?

94
00:05:57,611 --> 00:06:03,229
Speaker 0: we knew what it was like like In those early internet days like early petty arcade days.

95
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,858
Speaker 0: there was a weird mystique like everyone wants a mistake even in the 90s.

96
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:21,414
Speaker 1: Yeah because it was like hey all the video game all the big video game companies get together in this place once a year and show off all the new video games before anywhere else and there weren't really like Big fan cons like you know them today.

97
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:22,660
Speaker 0: that were gaming company, right?

98
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,843
Speaker 1: That were all you use.

99
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:28,440
Speaker 1: the only thing you you could only experience e3 through the pages of a video game magazine.

100
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:31,640
Speaker 1: Right, like someone telling you I went to this amazing Holy Land.

101
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:36,083
Speaker 1: Let me tell you about it with some photos and some text and it's like Holy.

102
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:40,300
Speaker 0: I see a photo and be like wait, are they playing a prototype of hardware that didn't come out yet?

103
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,378
Speaker 0: I would like salivate over those images.

104
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,781
Speaker 1: Right and there was like these mysterious was like Hall E or something Like.

105
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:52,754
Speaker 1: there was supposedly this hall that had like, you know, the small time Rondo stuff that we write.

106
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:57,955
Speaker 0: that was like Not to be confused with the special hall at the San Diego comic-con.

107
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:58,758
Speaker 0: That's a whole other thing.

108
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,319
Speaker 0: Hall D I forget which one's which that all blurs together, right?

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,186
Speaker 1: The San Diego comic-con one is just.

110
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:07,520
Speaker 1: that's just a big panel room that has the big lines and the big celebrities.

111
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:17,505
Speaker 1: the one at the E3 is like the secret room where the small time places are showing off these, you know rarity games like hey kid Here's the good stuff Right exactly.

112
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,880
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is obviously e3 is you know, it's gone up.

113
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,289
Speaker 1: It's gone down up and down all over the place.

114
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:29,014
Speaker 1: bad good getting their lunch eaten by packs Who knows companies have left saying we don't need you.

115
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,039
Speaker 1: We'll do all our own thing.

116
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,668
Speaker 1: Oh wait We'll come back and we'll work with you.

117
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:33,197
Speaker 1: We're gonna not happen.

118
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:33,619
Speaker 1: We're gonna happen.

119
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,423
Speaker 1: Pandemic reasons.

120
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:37,992
Speaker 1: other reasons what's happening with e3 this year?

121
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:40,380
Speaker 1: e3 is not only happening this year.

122
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,118
Speaker 1: It's an online only deal and all the big companies seem to be going in on it.

123
00:07:46,740 --> 00:08:00,640
Speaker 0: Nintendo's like yeah Okay III will come and do your online e3 and then such and such so make sense because they need There's that you need to tie your buzz to a broader buzz or have earth-shattering news to get noticed.

124
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:03,849
Speaker 1: I know they got their Nintendo direct today.

125
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,474
Speaker 1: What do they need e3 for?

126
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:06,657
Speaker 1: but I guess they're going in on it.

127
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:11,908
Speaker 0: So What was the next buzz Nintendo was gonna have until they announced dates?

128
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:22,866
Speaker 1: for breath of the wild - I Don't know the point is be on the lookout for Big hot news is from all the video game companies all at once in a blob around.

129
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,090
Speaker 1: the time actually happens.

130
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:25,053
Speaker 1: There's a split.

131
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:29,328
Speaker 0: so Nintendo Microsoft Konami and Ubisoft are like doubling down on e3 online.

132
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:36,068
Speaker 0: Yeah, Activision and Sony are not going to be included at this time, right?

133
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:38,841
Speaker 1: Yeah And you know not every company's.

134
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,650
Speaker 1: it's gonna be June 12 through 15.

135
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,409
Speaker 1: So in early June look for big video game news.

136
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:52,408
Speaker 1: Yeah You can expect you know April May to actually be a dry spell for big triple-a video game news because they're gonna be holding their cards until e3.

137
00:08:53,703 --> 00:09:00,090
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, so in some other news this happens often, but it's happening again for another platform.

138
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:01,597
Speaker 0: So it's worth sort of just pointing at.

139
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,270
Speaker 0: but PS Vita or Vita games.

140
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,379
Speaker 0: I never had one but there were a lot of games that were released on that thing that were exclusive to it Like they were developed for it.

141
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,549
Speaker 0: They only came out on it.

142
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:12,514
Speaker 0: It wasn't like a piece.

143
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:19,990
Speaker 1: there are a lot of games that were exclusive to PSP, you know PS Vita whatever all the portable PlayStations of which there probably will never be another one.

144
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,786
Speaker 1: I am not I guess I can't guarantee that but it seems likely.

145
00:09:22,806 --> 00:09:26,895
Speaker 1: Yeah and You know there were a lot of some of the.

146
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:33,141
Speaker 1: there were some good games on there some exclusive ones and Some of them got ported to other systems and some of them didn't.

147
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:35,650
Speaker 1: I think us the switch is like a really good destination.

148
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:41,804
Speaker 1: Any developers or publishers that put games out on those platforms Would do well to just shove them in the switch.

149
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:42,850
Speaker 0: Esha hundred percent.

150
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:53,070
Speaker 0: The tricky part seems that a lot of the companies that made these things are either gone or have changed radically Don't have the resources to do a port and probably couldn't make enough money to justify the port.

151
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,910
Speaker 0: So there's sort of a race to preserve these games somehow.

152
00:09:57,771 --> 00:10:01,906
Speaker 1: Right, you'll probably see things like I remember there being like a PSP contra or something.

153
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:02,950
Speaker 1: That wasn't anything else.

154
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,393
Speaker 1: That's like.

155
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:04,562
Speaker 1: that's how old my memory is.

156
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:05,530
Speaker 1: that was when I was in college.

157
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:08,695
Speaker 1: But it's like yeah, you can see.

158
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,985
Speaker 1: probably, you know, maybe it was re-released and I didn't notice.

159
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:16,480
Speaker 1: but you could probably be like in the Future like, you know PSP mega pack.

160
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,370
Speaker 1: and it'll be like, you know, 10 bucks 10 PSP games.

161
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,705
Speaker 1: You know some bundle running on who knows what platform.

162
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:25,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, well just like on the switch We have these compilations of like.

163
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:29,730
Speaker 0: here's a bunch of old arcade games in a package every Mega Man game.

164
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,858
Speaker 1: You know 50 bucks what I like.

165
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,023
Speaker 0: those are still my weakness.

166
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:34,449
Speaker 0: whenever there's a package of like.

167
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:37,179
Speaker 0: hey Here's every game in some series that you've played.

168
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,930
Speaker 0: a little bit of part of my brain says oh I should just buy that.

169
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:40,675
Speaker 0: So I have it.

170
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:41,721
Speaker 1: good thing.

171
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:42,889
Speaker 1: I have my policy now.

172
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:54,829
Speaker 0: Yeah I have implemented the similar policy of I only buy a game if the price it's on sale to the point that arounds down to zero or I am going to play it as soon as it finishes downloading.

173
00:10:55,811 --> 00:11:03,137
Speaker 1: Like I'm gonna sit there and wait for it to download and unless it's litter even if a game is I don't see mine is Even more strict even if it's one penny.

174
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:06,750
Speaker 1: I won't buy it unless I am going to install it and play it immediately.

175
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:09,118
Speaker 1: If it's zero dollars, okay.

176
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:09,881
Speaker 1: Yeah, then I will.

177
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:11,789
Speaker 1: then I'll just whatever it cost zero.

178
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:17,010
Speaker 0: now I did at the last second by any that Mario 3d compilation the anniversary one.

179
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,015
Speaker 1: No, I had no need for that.

180
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:20,943
Speaker 0: I bought it in cartridge for me.

181
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:22,910
Speaker 1: I have all the games in the compilation.

182
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,552
Speaker 1: What do I need?

183
00:11:23,572 --> 00:11:31,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't cuz I was sponging off at your we and your gamecube for many years I'd ever owned either of those consoles myself.

184
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:32,851
Speaker 1: Okay.

185
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:35,779
Speaker 0: Well, but yeah, the all these games are disappearing.

186
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:36,761
Speaker 0: same old story.

187
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,125
Speaker 0: I got a link to it right here.

188
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:40,050
Speaker 0: I got a little news.

189
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:42,797
Speaker 0: This is you might have seen this.

190
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,102
Speaker 0: it kind of made some.

191
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:46,350
Speaker 0: it made the rounds on like the reddits and everything.

192
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,455
Speaker 0: But you don't know.

193
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:52,379
Speaker 0: Magnus Carlsen is the reigning chess world champion Like just gay.

194
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:59,776
Speaker 0: yeah the chess champion in a recent game against Hikaru Nakamura During a tournament.

195
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:05,709
Speaker 0: He did something that the internet noticed and by the internet I mean even the non chess internet.

196
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,199
Speaker 0: He played an opening.

197
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:11,430
Speaker 0: that is kind of a joke on the internet.

198
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,389
Speaker 0: That is specifically known as the bong cloud.

199
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:19,762
Speaker 0: It is a the best way I can describe this.

200
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:20,325
Speaker 0: I'll link to this.

201
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:21,089
Speaker 1: you can watch a video.

202
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:23,664
Speaker 0: a great What a great name, you know what this opening is.

203
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:33,528
Speaker 0: do fucking Ridiculous nonsense and try to put the game in such a broken state that both players are just lost in a fog And may the best player win.

204
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,740
Speaker 0: Okay, break the game and see what.

205
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,030
Speaker 1: he just be just bored doing the same old same old.

206
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,533
Speaker 1: So he went.

207
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:52,950
Speaker 0: now it's it let loose the bong cloud, you know, yeah Apparently this opening was like known among like people who play chess online But like no one played it in like a super serious tournament and the internet like noticed that this was happening.

208
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,169
Speaker 0: There was a whole thing around it.

209
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,817
Speaker 1: He probably learned about it from the internet.

210
00:12:55,898 --> 00:12:59,729
Speaker 1: people are on the famous people on the internet to yep He can read reddit, right?

211
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:09,210
Speaker 0: you know like Justin Bieber big Leafs fan like talks about them a lot just randomly online like Probably on leaves to reddit or at least Twitter, you know.

212
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, like people who are famous like things that are fans of other people who are more or less famous Yeah, they're reading the same shit.

213
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,278
Speaker 1: You're reading.

214
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:17,121
Speaker 1: They know what's going on.

215
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:19,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, there isn't like a secret to it.

216
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,164
Speaker 1: I'm just calls and probably knows it's called the bong cloud.

217
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:21,869
Speaker 1: He's like, you know what?

218
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,581
Speaker 1: It is like if I lose this tournament, that's not a big deal.

219
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:29,992
Speaker 0: It's not Magnus Carlsen's tiny thumbnail I can barely see just from the news page I got up.

220
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:39,690
Speaker 0: I see a stream and it looks like both of the players are like like like One of them is laughing and the other one is clearly like trying to stifle a laugh as the opening.

221
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:45,129
Speaker 1: But they probably both know about the bond cloud, right?

222
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:51,951
Speaker 0: But it also speaks to something we've talked about a lot not as much on geek nights But we talked about this a lot in panels we do Around.

223
00:13:52,012 --> 00:14:03,044
Speaker 0: how chess has this endgame where all the attractors in the like the math of chess are draws like Gay like yeah, a eyes are pushing chest to the who won.

224
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:04,270
Speaker 1: the who won the bond cloud game?

225
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:08,570
Speaker 0: I don't actually know and I'm gonna find out later cuz I didn't actually do it.

226
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:10,740
Speaker 1: So I've always been sort of mad on chess.

227
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,339
Speaker 1: cuz I don't like to memorize openings and stuff But the fact that there's an opening called the bunk.

228
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:20,137
Speaker 1: Maybe I should maybe I should memorize that Opening and not learn anything.

229
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:23,670
Speaker 1: I'm not interested in learning anything more about chess than I already know, right?

230
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,324
Speaker 1: You know, I just sort of play naturally like I look a few moves ahead.

231
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,621
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll kill two of your guys And you'll kill one of mine.

232
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:30,289
Speaker 1: That seems good.

233
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:31,736
Speaker 1: That's how I play.

234
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:40,689
Speaker 0: playing the epon first is a very natural opening in chess But moving the king up to e2 is essentially always a terrible second move.

235
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:50,510
Speaker 1: The point is I should learn The the the bond cloud and just play until the openings over and then from there just play naturally just you know.

236
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,321
Speaker 1: However, I feel like yeah, I don't even ever have to play shit.

237
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:55,810
Speaker 0: I can't imagine what the endgame looks like for the bond cloud.

238
00:14:55,871 --> 00:15:01,762
Speaker 0: I'm actually there's a Early game looks like I have not watched the full video.

239
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:02,564
Speaker 1: This is the first.

240
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:12,090
Speaker 0: this is the first I've heard of it Like ooh, I'm gonna start with the Polish opening and then the other Scott's across from me and he just smiles that King moves forward.

241
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:18,121
Speaker 1: It's anyway I gotta talk about a geek bite this little game here.

242
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,350
Speaker 1: So I don't know how I remember how I found this game.

243
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:22,055
Speaker 1: It's on Steam.

244
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:24,365
Speaker 1: It's 10 bucks, but you can play a free demo.

245
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:25,530
Speaker 1: You don't need to pay the 10 bucks.

246
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,716
Speaker 1: It's still early access.

247
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,550
Speaker 1: You might want to wait for like the full version if you do want to pay the 10 bucks.

248
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:44,350
Speaker 1: I did pay the 10 bucks because I did install it and play it immediately and I've played it Once it once in a while, you know every few days I'll open it up and play it like one time and the game is luck be a landlord Obviously named after the Frank Sinatra song luck be a lady.

249
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,161
Speaker 1: I don't know if that came from somewhere before Frank Sinatra.

250
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:53,063
Speaker 1: it may have and I'm just not aware of it But yeah, so what this game is is something very clever.

251
00:15:53,083 --> 00:16:05,148
Speaker 1: It is Sort of a deck building game in a way right and where you start with five Symbols it was a Robert Alda first performed it.

252
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:15,870
Speaker 1: Okay, and you start with five symbols and then after every spin of a slot machine You add a symbol to the slot machine.

253
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,930
Speaker 1: So it starts out with like a cherry a cat a coin and a couple other thing, right?

254
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,638
Speaker 1: And it's like, okay, you spun the slot machine.

255
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,603
Speaker 1: You got this many coins.

256
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,409
Speaker 1: What do you want to add to your slot machine?

257
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:28,850
Speaker 1: a dwarf?

258
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:35,306
Speaker 1: Like a goose a clam or a goose, right?

259
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:43,489
Speaker 1: It's like, okay I guess I'll add the goose and each thing you add to the slot machine has different rules Surrounding it right?

260
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,932
Speaker 1: So if a dwarf it stops and he's adjacent to meaning in the eight spaces You know.

261
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:53,682
Speaker 1: next not just orthogonally adjacent just adjacent to the dwarf.

262
00:16:54,144 --> 00:17:03,561
Speaker 1: if any of those contain an alcoholic beverage The alcoholic beverage will be removed and the dwarf will give you a whole bunch of coins Cuz he you know to pay for the beer.

263
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:04,748
Speaker 0: Oh, no, this sounds good.

264
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,136
Speaker 1: There's also like a bartender.

265
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:11,749
Speaker 1: the bartender has like a 10% chance of creating an alcoholic beverage.

266
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:21,269
Speaker 1: If you have a key and it ends adjacent to like a safe or a lockbox The key and the lockbox both go away and a bunch of money comes out, right?

267
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:25,270
Speaker 1: So, you know, there's all these sorts of synergies between symbols.

268
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:27,900
Speaker 1: The best the thing is no matter what symbols you get.

269
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,390
Speaker 1: I have not found anything better than cultists.

270
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:32,318
Speaker 1: It's like a cultist is one coin.

271
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,290
Speaker 1: two cultists means two coins each.

272
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,572
Speaker 1: They don't need to be adjacent.

273
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:38,596
Speaker 1: three cultists three coins each.

274
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:40,199
Speaker 1: four cult is four coins each.

275
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:40,640
Speaker 1: you get it.

276
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,365
Speaker 1: Cultists are just the best.

277
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:47,660
Speaker 1: I'm the only time I've gone deep in this game with huge payouts is with a lot of cultists.

278
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,931
Speaker 0: Well, the game is early access.

279
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:55,860
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll nerf the cultists Maybe but this game is actually updated rather frequently with significant updates.

280
00:17:56,221 --> 00:18:02,657
Speaker 1: It's even a timer on the bottom left of the main menu that tells you how long until the next update launches.

281
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:05,351
Speaker 1: Whoa There's real fun.

282
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:08,261
Speaker 1: There's also Items.

283
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:09,927
Speaker 1: so like you key after every.

284
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:19,202
Speaker 1: basically the it's called luck be a landlord because this the story of this game is That you move into an apartment and you got to pay the rent and the rent starts out at $25.

285
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:23,737
Speaker 1: So and you have I think six spins of the slot machine, right?

286
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:24,319
Speaker 1: It's like we put.

287
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,039
Speaker 1: don't worry We put a slot machine in your apartment to help you pay rent.

288
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:32,560
Speaker 0: So I feel like that's gonna move from satire to truth within a decade, right?

289
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,560
Speaker 1: But you get you get a certain number of spins before you have to pay rent and you start with five symbols.

290
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:42,800
Speaker 1: So you're gonna get the rent on the first rent payment no matter what unless you really eff it up, right?

291
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,445
Speaker 1: But then you have.

292
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,674
Speaker 1: then as soon as you pay rent you get an item.

293
00:18:47,116 --> 00:19:04,771
Speaker 1: you get to choose an item Which is like a permanent ability sort of like a relic and slay the spire as opposed to a card Right, and then it's like, okay well Your next rent payment is even bigger and you have this many spins to get to that next rent payment and you keep doing this Until eventually you pay the seven seven seven rent.

294
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:10,071
Speaker 1: as soon as you pay the triple seven rent You've won the game and then you enter endless mode.

295
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:17,140
Speaker 1: if you would like to enter endless mode and keep paying Exponentially higher basically a deck builder, but the deck is a slot machine.

296
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:19,000
Speaker 1: It's a solo deck builder.

297
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:21,669
Speaker 1: but you don't draw hands or play hands.

298
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:41,700
Speaker 1: your entire deck gets shuffled on a slot machine and 25 of the symbols in your slot in your The available ones you have appear in a random arrangement on the grid and then score Appropriately and sometimes get consumed meaning, you know, they get they're removed from your deck for the next spin.

299
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,339
Speaker 0: Well, I see one like coal after 20 spins turns into a diamond.

300
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,954
Speaker 1: Diamonds are pretty great because they're sort of like cultists in which their cultists are won by default.

301
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:58,758
Speaker 1: diamonds are I think five by default And the more diamonds you have They all increase each other's value similar to cultists.

302
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:01,593
Speaker 1: So Diamonds are like the ultimate thing.

303
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:10,325
Speaker 1: just a screen full of diamonds I think might be the highest possible payout you could get because it would be five times 25 plus Some.

304
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:12,156
Speaker 1: you know the math on that.

305
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:12,658
Speaker 1: It's yeah.

306
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:21,678
Speaker 1: But yeah There's a lot and the thing is a lot of the symbols and the interactions between the symbols and the items are just a whole lot Of fun and are really cute and wholesome.

307
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:27,799
Speaker 1: Most of the time like you have a thief the thief every time he shows up takes a coin from you.

308
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:41,510
Speaker 1: but when you catch the thief either with a banana peel or With the bounty hunter or with like general zaroff who kills all humans Then you'll get every thief the coin stole.

309
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,256
Speaker 1: you will get back times four.

310
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:46,751
Speaker 0: Oh So apparently also very important news.

311
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:48,420
Speaker 0: There's a dog and you can pet the dog.

312
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:51,560
Speaker 1: Yep, there's a lot of stuff going on in this game.

313
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:58,300
Speaker 1: So it's a really cute fun single-player like very brief thing to do and it changes every so often.

314
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:06,920
Speaker 1: So like every day or two, I'll open it up and play it one time Usually while I'm waiting for something else like a geek nights to start or something of that nature, right?

315
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:14,353
Speaker 1: I'll just open it up Like if I've got steam and we're gonna play sieve and everyone's still chatting I'll just open it up play it one time and then up the sieves ready.

316
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:15,557
Speaker 1: Okay, close my slot machine.

317
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,152
Speaker 1: So I recommend this and it's still early access $10 game.

318
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:21,834
Speaker 1: I recommend it.

319
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:32,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, nice and cute but anyway things Of the day.

320
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,140
Speaker 0: so check this.

321
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,826
Speaker 0: this is a video from 2018.

322
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:46,920
Speaker 0: I didn't know this was at the Met But basically this is the oldest piano in the world from the early 1700s like it's the oldest one that exists.

323
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:56,410
Speaker 0: Not only does it exist, but it's playable and This is a video of someone playing the oldest piano in the world.

324
00:21:57,391 --> 00:22:07,290
Speaker 0: That is pretty fascinating in and of itself And there's a little bit of explanation about Like how it was built and where it came from and how the guy who made it wasn't actually trying to invent the piano.

325
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:08,708
Speaker 0: He was actually trying to do something else.

326
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:18,410
Speaker 0: and if you're interested in this the rabbit hole you can follow on the origins of the piano and Where like the clavichord and like what happened to the harpsichord?

327
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:19,435
Speaker 0: There is.

328
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:31,030
Speaker 0: there is so much nonsense there That is way more complicated than you would ever expect But sounds pretty good for an instrument from the 1700s that is still working and not just like a brass instrument.

329
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:36,390
Speaker 0: Mmm, imagine if your job was to maintain this thing though, like don't break it.

330
00:22:39,435 --> 00:22:49,949
Speaker 0: I think there's a little bit of ship of Theseus going on But it is like the original keys as far as I've read like almost everything on it is original Except I think they've replaced a lot of the strings of these as they've broken over the years.

331
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,069
Speaker 0: Okay, probably some of the pads - I assume.

332
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:55,888
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

333
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,735
Speaker 1: What do I have as my thing of the day?

334
00:22:58,775 --> 00:22:59,317
Speaker 1: Let me see.

335
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,123
Speaker 0: I know you're trying to run that train.

336
00:23:01,143 --> 00:23:02,427
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

337
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:05,650
Speaker 1: Okay, so I haven't.

338
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:09,950
Speaker 1: This is fanfiction that someone posted to an archive of our own.

339
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:15,990
Speaker 1: I don't think I've ever done a fanfictions thing of the day before because I don't read fanfiction.

340
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,176
Speaker 1: I read, you know, I know of it.

341
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:18,805
Speaker 1: I respect it, but I don't.

342
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:19,730
Speaker 1: it's not my thing, right?

343
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:32,661
Speaker 0: Last one I was at RIT when we read Sailor Moon saves the furries out loud at in capstone that one - okay But yeah, someone named I guess mewd M-e-w-d.

344
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:34,070
Speaker 1: I think that's the author's name there.

345
00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:36,797
Speaker 1: I saw this on Twitter.

346
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:40,434
Speaker 1: someone linked to it and it's the name of the Fanfiction really caught me.

347
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:42,300
Speaker 1: and then I read the summary and that caught me.

348
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:50,250
Speaker 1: and I read the first page slash chapter And that was enough for me to know that I could make this a thing of the day.

349
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,214
Speaker 1: I haven't read the whole thing.

350
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:54,406
Speaker 1: So let me just read you this summary and the title in the summary.

351
00:23:54,427 --> 00:23:59,130
Speaker 1: The title is Daisy and Waluigi dream star wannabes by mewd.

352
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:02,278
Speaker 0: I'm already intrigued.

353
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:06,033
Speaker 0: just that it's Daisy and Waluigi summary princess.

354
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:15,741
Speaker 1: Daisy and Waluigi team up to upstage Mario and become big shot heroes and destroy and/or save the world in the Process and maybe fall in love if there's time after that.

355
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:16,906
Speaker 1: Wow a sprawl.

356
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:26,250
Speaker 1: a sprawling Novel length romantic comedy action Nintendo adventure where Daisy confronts her past her feelings of self-worth and her feelings for Waluigi.

357
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:30,059
Speaker 0: I'd I'd Sprawling novel leg.

Speaker 1: It's a lot.

361
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:38,690
Speaker 1: I mean Just have the summary be the thing of the day.

362
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:45,769
Speaker 1: I don't know and I can't tell you if you should read on beyond the chapter one But like, you know, there are 38 chapters in this thing.

363
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:54,730
Speaker 1: If you are gonna write a fan fiction That is the bar for a compelling summary to get people to care about it, right?

364
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,927
Speaker 0: Um Have a go I'm just skimming it.

365
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,979

366

372
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,049
Speaker 0: We'll probably be on that.

373
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:19,679
Speaker 0: We have a sprawling internet presence.

374
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,309
Speaker 0: So check us out at all the places we exist.

375
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:40,359

00:26:57,838 --> 00:27:02,380
Speaker 1: whenever we do Board game reviews right rim makes a YouTube video.

404
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,550
Speaker 1: That's just the review and then attaches it to the board game.

405
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:13,385
Speaker 1: So if you go to board game geek and you find a game there in the video section on the game on board game geek You may see a geek nights YouTube video there.

406
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:17,017
Speaker 0: Yep Surprising amount of traffic gets comes from that.

407
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,280
Speaker 0: like you'd be surprised.

408
00:27:18,882 --> 00:27:22,050
Speaker 1: We have a steam group and steam curator page.

409
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,796
Speaker 1: So those are sort of the same thing.

410
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:25,242
Speaker 1: one and a half things right?

411
00:27:25,623 --> 00:27:27,430

Speaker 1: We are on Google podcast run Amazon podcasts.

415
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:40,223
Speaker 1: Rim made a LinkedIn page when he treated me.

416
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:48,288
Speaker 1: He said that he basically Instead of a company page He made geek nights as a company on LinkedIn that someone could theoretically be an employee of.

417
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:50,729
Speaker 1: yeah I guess maybe I should attach myself to it.

418
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:57,450
Speaker 0: I forgot about it until Scott was asking me to like find places We're not thinking of and I bump into it by accident.

419
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:05,454
Speaker 0: I made that so long ago because like real talk I put geek nights on my actual resume like I like when I got my current job I like.

420
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:08,490
Speaker 0: they asked me about it and I was like, yes, this is this thing I do.

421
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:09,536
Speaker 0: It's a whole big thing.

422
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:11,629
Speaker 0: I'm gonna keep doing it or I'm not gonna work here.

423
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:19,472
Speaker 1: the point is is that the final one that we know that we've managed to list so far is Amazon.

424
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:25,069
Speaker 1: we have an Amazon fashion page where you can buy a nice t-shirt directly from Amazon and I'll spoil it.

425

00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:38,110
Speaker 1: Yep We had an IRC channel at some point.

429
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,050
Speaker 1: I don't know if it still exists, but there are logs of that IRC channel.

Speaker 1: It's like, you know, so Take that as you will.

449
00:29:34,496 --> 00:29:36,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, otherwise we're.

450
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:41,218
Speaker 0: uh, we're reading the tale again G Sure, so read along with us.

451
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:42,141
Speaker 0: It's the first novel.

452
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:42,463
Speaker 0: like.

453
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:44,430
Speaker 0: read the first one, right?

454
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,434
Speaker 0: You gotta read the thing.

455
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:56,264
Speaker 1: if before you read Daisy and Waluigi Dream star wannabes right the newest greatest novel in the history of humans, right?

456
00:29:56,665 --> 00:30:06,609
Speaker 0: You got to start with the first novel in Genji's just kind of going like Just gets into trouble gets out of trouble.

457
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:09,090
Speaker 0: Consequences happen mostly to other people.

458
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,647
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I've taken away from this so far.

459
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:17,661
Speaker 1: Okay, so let us go to the main bit and then I need dinner.

460
00:30:18,162 --> 00:30:20,548
Speaker 0: All right, let me jump right into that.

461
00:30:22,094 --> 00:30:22,580
Speaker 0: There we go.

462
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:30,010
Speaker 0: Okay so JRPGs, we've never really talked about like that on geek nights except tangentially.

463
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:36,410
Speaker 1: Well, I think what happened is Tuesday is a day where we all we're always playing games more often than other things.

464
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,950
Speaker 1: We always have a game to talk about usually or a convention.

465
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:52,150
Speaker 1: Well, at least refresh the pool and so we haven't had to resort to like, you know more generic sort of Conceptual show ideas for Tuesdays as we do on other days.

466
00:30:52,330 --> 00:31:01,842
Speaker 1: but also we have done a few Tuesday shows on like shmups or Things that right like more just targeting a whole genre at once.

467
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:04,150
Speaker 1: but we haven't done a lot of those.

468
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:08,989
Speaker 1: So we're like, well, we haven't actually both played a new game.

469
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:12,099
Speaker 1: You know that we haven't done a show on recently.

470
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,604
Speaker 0: who new FPS is.

471
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,430
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try out this weekend.

472
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:22,199
Speaker 1: Okay, and there are a lot of games coming up soon that I think will both play like that one that I linked to.

473
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:28,845
Speaker 1: that I discovered today, that's like a Like an our xcom plus slay the spire combo possibly.

474
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:29,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm worried about that.

475
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:34,007
Speaker 0: one Might be too good for me exactly.

476
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:40,969
Speaker 0: We're playing a lot of games we've played before and already reviewed on geek nights - like right.

477
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,489
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna do this big show or another train game show.

478
00:31:45,352 --> 00:31:47,962
Speaker 0: Wait, let's talk about hearts of iron or still are.

479
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:50,150
Speaker 1: so I was like, hey, let's just do a genre show.

480
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,702
Speaker 1: We'll talk about a whole genre of games in general, which there are many genres.

481
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:57,550
Speaker 1: You haven't discussed pick one pick JRPGs.

482
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,137
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about JRPGs.

483
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:01,065
Speaker 0: Yeah now full disclosure.

484
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:06,144
Speaker 0: I Don't like JRPGs anymore like for the most part.

485
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:11,070
Speaker 0: like I don't play modern ones I keep an eye on them like I learn about them, but I tend not to play them.

486
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:22,850
Speaker 0: But at the same time as much as I want to say I can't deal with those mechanics I am playing Final Fantasy 4 randomizers for some reason right also.

487
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:30,630
Speaker 0: Sometimes I feel this urge to go level up in a JRPG like just poke it Final Fantasy 1 in an emulator.

488
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,192
Speaker 0: It's weird.

489
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:37,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's very strange how you know, you know, we had the D&D right the pen and paper RPGs.

490
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:50,117
Speaker 1: Yeah predating for example the piece, you know the RPGs that were on various PCs Right and they varied Spectrums and Commodores and Amigas and DOS.

491
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:54,190
Speaker 1: and you know all those old PC platforms Commodores apples, right?

492
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,409
Speaker 1: There were all cars RPGs on those platforms.

493
00:32:58,098 --> 00:33:05,790
Speaker 1: and then Once you know in Japan you had them on you know The MSX or the FM towns or the PC 9, you know all kinds of different platforms.

494
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,091
Speaker 1: And there's

495
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:13,202
Speaker 0: all these different lineages of these games like we get into that history like From a very different world from some of these other games,

496
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:34,529
Speaker 1: right but that core mechanic there right of you know, the the the combat of D&D was just brought over to Video games right in this sort of fashion where it's like you're still calling it an RPG When this like the role-playing element is like, where is it?

497
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:41,555
Speaker 0: You know You're not that's that was our first facts panel that beyond D&D the original version of that where we talked a lot about It's a role-playing game.

498
00:33:41,595 --> 00:33:43,641
Speaker 0: But what actual role-playing are you doing?

499
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:54,514
Speaker 1: Right or even if you are, you know It's like you're limited to just like this subset of actions, right if you play like a gold box game or you know A shadow gate.

500
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:58,294
Speaker 1: those aren't JRPGs obviously, but there's still computer Versions.

501
00:33:58,314 --> 00:34:03,881
Speaker 1: right because computers are so limited then they still even today still are quite limited.

502
00:34:03,902 --> 00:34:18,614
Speaker 1: right You know when you're playing a tabletop RPG Even if it's just a dungeon crawly one where you fighting monsters and traps and doing all these things Your you know human brains you affect you have a human GM possibly Depending on the game.

503
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:25,070
Speaker 1: He said this wealth of basically infinite possibilities It's like you know what I could do all this stuff with my 10-foot pole.

504
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,139
Speaker 1: What if I poke the bee's nest with it, right?

505
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:34,152
Speaker 1: It's like whereas in a computer game even today It's like if they don't program in that specific Possibility.

506
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:44,750
Speaker 1: it's not a possibility Right, you know, so The JRPG is like comes out of the fact that they were even more limited in those days.

507
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,928
Speaker 1: they wanted to translate that tabletop D&D experience to the computer.

508
00:34:48,949 --> 00:35:01,170
Speaker 1: and You know the American peep game developers and you know British game developers did it in certain ways and the Japanese game developers did it in the Dragon Quest?

509
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,277
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy way.

510
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:16,506
Speaker 0: Oh, it's interesting because at the same time the actual Japanese role-playing game space at the time was a lot broader than what Americans recognized and Back then no one called those JRPGs.

511
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:28,517
Speaker 0: They were just RPGs and The most popular RPGs in America at the time Ended up being the ones that were mostly on the NES and SNES Just due to like.

512
00:35:28,597 --> 00:35:30,630
Speaker 0: that was when gaming started to become more mainstream.

513
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,623
Speaker 0: That was a very accessible popular affordable console.

514
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:35,370
Speaker 0: for a lot of people those two consoles.

515
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:42,910
Speaker 0: so That was right around when Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest were also available in the US.

516
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,495
Speaker 0: so a lot of people like.

517
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:55,826
Speaker 0: the term JRPG came way later to try to differentiate one subset of Japanese RPGs that are themselves together a subset of like digital RPGs.

518
00:35:56,427 --> 00:36:01,350
Speaker 0: and right term is Not like the fact even though it stands for a Japanese role-playing game.

519
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:07,928
Speaker 0: It's not really a useful or accurate term because Japanese role-playing games are far more diverse than most people would like.

520
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:16,351
Speaker 0: hide lied Arguably comes from that same lineage, but no no one who played hide lied today in America would say oh, that's a JRPG Right.

521
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:34,690
Speaker 1: the common, you know the common tropes of a JRPG right is that there's some sort of overworld right that you walk around on And there's random encounters right and then there's gonna be some sort of turn-based Combat where you know positioning usually doesn't matter too much.

522
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,267
Speaker 1: It's usually you're choosing just an actions per character right fight run.

523
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:45,829
Speaker 1: You know Magic spell special ability of some kind right you know like steel or something.

524
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,945
Speaker 1: You know the bad guys go you go you have hit points.

525
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:50,830
Speaker 1: You don't want to die.

526
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:59,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, you go to towns you talk to people you go to dungeons you walk around There's random encounters in the dungeon, but also boss battles, but also treasure chests full of items.

527
00:37:00,274 --> 00:37:08,930
Speaker 1: And then you know through talking to the characters And also cutscenes and dialogue and boss dialogue and things of that nature.

528
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:13,624
Speaker 1: There's usual, and there's usually this really very involved.

529
00:37:14,006 --> 00:37:18,963
Speaker 1: You know sort of epic Fantasy story usually a fantasy or sci-fi story.

530
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:29,549
Speaker 1: yeah that unfolds sometimes with cutscenes and cinematics and all sorts of other embellishments usually Fantastic music of some kind.

531
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:36,508
Speaker 1: And you know those elements together is usually what makes a JRPG versus?

532
00:37:36,528 --> 00:37:44,970
Speaker 1: yeah, you know Like in a Skyrim, which is definitely a computer video game RPG that doesn't really have all of those elements.

533
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:54,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time while we're calling the show JRPGs, and we're gonna talk about these same kinds of games I don't think that term is useful because even like game nerds all Disagree on exactly what it means.

534
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,670
Speaker 0: if you say it means any role-playing game made in Japan.

535
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:00,570
Speaker 0: Most of them are nothing like what we're describing.

536
00:38:01,336 --> 00:38:01,579
Speaker 1: Right.

537
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:08,198
Speaker 0: it's useful in Action JRPG and AJ RPG like that.

538
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,322
Speaker 0: there is not.

539
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:17,550
Speaker 1: there's no consistency in this nomenclature The way I use it and I think the only useful way to use it is you're basically a short way of saying a game.

540
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:24,593
Speaker 1: That's very similar to Dragon quest Final Fantasy yep chrono trigger Etc.

541
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:25,637
Speaker 0: that's what we're going with.

542
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:28,530
Speaker 1: but even there's a game along those lines.

543
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,708
Speaker 0: So I pulled up a Wikipedia page that is interesting because it's a listen Oh blade.

544
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:41,210
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Lunar is kind of right in our games that we know some people are obsessed with right.

545
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:46,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know all those he's wanders from years and all that or wise yeast is more of an action one.

546
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:54,257
Speaker 0: Yeah They're actually all kind of different because there was the one that a lot of Americans were familiar with on the SNES Which was luffia.

547
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,710
Speaker 0: yeah luffia breath of fire.

548
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:58,675
Speaker 1: Yeah, I said breath.

549
00:38:58,716 --> 00:38:58,896
Speaker 0: Yeah.

550
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,021
Speaker 0: I wasn't listening to you.

551
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:00,865
Speaker 0: I was looking at this page.

552
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:01,990
Speaker 0: I got this list here.

553
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:07,225
Speaker 0: It's a Wikipedia page of the best-selling Japanese role-playing game franchise Pokemon earthbound.

554
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,870
Speaker 0: yep, so this is fascinating.

555
00:39:08,991 --> 00:39:10,501
Speaker 0: This is franchise base.

556
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:14,888
Speaker 0: These are the best-selling Japanese Role-playing game.

557
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:16,537
Speaker 1: Pokemon is number one.

558
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:19,210
Speaker 0: Pokemon is number one by like double.

559
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:20,653
Speaker 1: Of course.

560
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:23,500
Speaker 0: number two is Final Fantasy.

561
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:30,707
Speaker 0: so take every Final Fantasy anyone ever bought on any platform and The Pokemons have sold about double.

562
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:37,445
Speaker 0: Okay Dragon Quest is about half again down, and then there's a long tail.

563
00:39:37,646 --> 00:39:41,309
Speaker 0: and it's interesting because it's like Monster Hunter Kingdom Hearts Souls.

564
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:43,344
Speaker 1: Monster Hunter is an action.

565
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:51,790
Speaker 1: You know Right it is a Japanese role-playing game franchise, so there's nothing role-playing about it really.

566
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,244
Speaker 1: It's an action game action RPG like let's not random encounters.

567
00:39:56,284 --> 00:39:57,529
Speaker 1: You're not walking around the map.

568
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:57,930
Speaker 1: You're not.

569
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:01,293
Speaker 0: This is why I wouldn't class Not like.

570
00:40:01,473 --> 00:40:06,107
Speaker 1: it's not like Final Fantasy or like, but that's just you're like are?

571
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:09,195
Speaker 0: the two are working definition Useful definition of.

572
00:40:09,215 --> 00:40:11,501
Speaker 0: I just really want to drive home.

573
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:22,988
Speaker 0: the fact that the concept of JRPG uses as a genre is Silly and if you're gonna have a conversation like this you actually need to describe what you're talking about Because no one's gonna agree with you like clear at all.

574
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:27,010
Speaker 0: But the funniest thing about this is that one of the franchise is listed.

575
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:28,561
Speaker 0: It's like 15 down like.

576
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:29,689
Speaker 0: it's very high on the list.

577
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:37,943
Speaker 0: It's just called chrono because it's chrono trigger which consists of two games One of which was bad.

578
00:40:37,983 --> 00:40:41,583
Speaker 0: in my opinion Chrono cross chrono cross was not a good game.

579
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:42,790
Speaker 0: I did not even finish it.

580
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:47,890
Speaker 0: I could not stand it and radical dreamers is not listed because that's yeah anyway.

581
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,904
Speaker 1: So let's talk about games like Final Fantasy Dragon Quest etcetera.

582
00:40:51,945 --> 00:41:04,667
Speaker 1: So I first when I was young Right when I was young I actually didn't have Games like that, right Those were not the games that I would buy for the consoles that I had.

583
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:08,724
Speaker 0: those are the games I was the most obsessed with as a kid like I got fight like.

584
00:41:08,785 --> 00:41:11,930
Speaker 1: I think I think Had I bought a Super Nintendo?

585
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,310
Speaker 1: I probably would have had Final Fantasy 6 and chrono trigger earlier and then play them.

586
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,209
Speaker 0: See I started way earlier on the NES when I got my NES.

587
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,939
Speaker 0: So I upgraded from the Atari to the NES.

588
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,790
Speaker 0: Final Fantasy 1 was one of the first games I got.

589
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:34,247
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I didn't play Final Fantasy Anything until I basically had emulators in the later 90s like 90s.

590
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:38,187
Speaker 0: So I played Final Fantasy 1 and I was enough of a nerd.

591
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:42,470
Speaker 0: So when the SNES came out, I got Final Fantasy 2 and 3 and I was obsessed with them.

592
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,550
Speaker 0: It's scary to think that I was playing cuz I have this vivid memory.

593
00:41:46,233 --> 00:42:02,770
Speaker 0: I was playing Final Fantasy 4 which I knew is 2 on the Super Nintendo when I was home from a lot from school for lunch in Elementary school Mmm, and I have this memory of I got as far as the antlion.

594
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:10,990
Speaker 0: I hadn't saved my game and my mom said it was time to go back to school But I had to beat the boss as you wouldn't let me and I had to do that whole fucking dungeon again.

595
00:42:11,132 --> 00:42:15,969
Speaker 0: I was mad about it for like Probably an hour and then I forgot but it feels like I was mad for years.

596
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:22,425
Speaker 1: Yeah So at the time that I really started playing them right those late 90s.

597
00:42:22,586 --> 00:42:23,850
Speaker 1: I was like, whoa these games?

598
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:36,770
Speaker 1: I've seen them in magazines, right, but I finally understood like ah, that's what these games were I you know because I was somehow despite not having really played them that much all those tropes, right?

599
00:42:37,151 --> 00:42:42,370
Speaker 1: I I already somehow had learned those from somewhere like I knew how to play them even though I hadn't right.

600
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:49,010
Speaker 1: The first time I opened Final Fantasy 1 in nesticle, right the emulator, right?

601
00:42:49,351 --> 00:43:04,030
Speaker 1: I knew exactly how to play it like everything in there was completely familiar to me cuz it's a well-designed game like it the There was not any game that I had the NES cartridge for that even remotely resembled it right in any way.

602
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:04,875
Speaker 1: And I don't.

603
00:43:05,036 --> 00:43:07,169
Speaker 1: it's not the kind of game that you would play at a friend's house.

604
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:09,741
Speaker 1: Now what's definitely is a long single-player deal.

605
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:11,930
Speaker 0: the problem I ran into is that on the NES?

606
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:19,510
Speaker 0: Ultima Exodus and Ultima avatar To a kid who doesn't know better in an era where there isn't an internet they just looked like RPGs.

607
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,425
Speaker 0: I was like, oh I bet it's like Final Fantasy and in a lot of ways they are like.

608
00:43:23,526 --> 00:43:32,158
Speaker 0: I'd argue they're in the same genre but those games were just inscrutable Impossible nonsense to me as a kid.

609
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,537
Speaker 0: I could not like Final Fantasy 1 like Despite kid brain.

610
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,151
Speaker 0: I played it with the aim of beating it Like.

611
00:43:39,271 --> 00:43:47,101
Speaker 0: I knew there's something to beat and I like tried but when I played like Ultima Exodus at the same age I was just like water on the world and at no point.

612
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:48,085
Speaker 0: I have this concept of.

613
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,250
Speaker 0: this is a game that I could be.

614
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:52,778
Speaker 1: Well, I think that comes down to the linearity, right?

615
00:43:52,818 --> 00:43:56,790
Speaker 1: We sort of view linearity as like a negative in some ways, right?

616
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,283
Speaker 1: It's like you want this open-ended game.

617
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,110
Speaker 1: We can do what you want.

618
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:05,249
Speaker 1: It's like the dream and it's like you have like something like an Ultima and it's like alright and it's like What the hell do I do with you that you need?

619
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:11,403
Speaker 0: There's a very specific like path to win that game you can just approach in any order.

620
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:14,252
Speaker 1: the problem is not it's not clear it's not.

621
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:29,559
Speaker 0: the game doesn't tell you shit and Like, you know in it like in Final Fantasy or like even Simon's quest like as another example Even if the characters like the translations bad and the characters don't say useful things You can figure out on the puzzles pretty intuitively.

622
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:45,570
Speaker 0: in Ultima the puzzles are things like yeah, if you talk to these ten villagers across these ten different places You'll eventually figure out that in this one map when the moon is a certain way Walk forward three spaces left two spaces and search that empty spot.

623
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:55,890
Speaker 0: That doesn't look any different from any other spot in the world and you'll find a game necessary item Like very different philosophy of design even though superficially they were very similar.

624
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:56,853
Speaker 1: Right.

625
00:44:57,295 --> 00:45:01,270
Speaker 1: So in the with the or the JRPG side, it's much more linear.

626
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:06,716
Speaker 1: It's like you can only go one place or you can go maybe sometimes places You've already been or you can

627
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:18,525
Speaker 0: get to places that are a little too dangerous and you kind of avoid them or you figure out A way to do them, but you're always gated like the scope of your world Expands and expands and a lot of them especially the Final Fantasy is this trope.

628
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,050
Speaker 0: I know is in a lot of other games.

629
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:27,389
Speaker 0: They open up after they have taught you like what's going on usually by giving you effectively the airship.

630
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:30,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that was a trope for so long.

631
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:31,262
Speaker 0: Okay.

632
00:45:31,302 --> 00:45:32,085
Speaker 0: Now I got the airship.

633
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,049
Speaker 0: now I can go anywhere.

634
00:45:34,413 --> 00:45:41,130
Speaker 1: But even if you are opened up It's like most of the places you can go are all the old places and one new place.

635
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:47,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and it's like there's always some sort of gating either by danger of random encounters that will just kill you if you go to the wrong place.

636
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:54,050
Speaker 1: or You literally can't go to a place or you went to a place, but it's not the time to go to that place yet.

637
00:45:54,150 --> 00:46:00,116
Speaker 1: So you're just sort of seeing that this town exists, but it doesn't matter You're just here whatever.

638
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:04,110
Speaker 1: and when you come back to the town later as like ah now this town does something.

639
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:15,680
Speaker 0: But I do think a lot of them do have a moment where they get a little bit rudderless on purpose Like the game has gated you for so long and then finally it's like alright now you can just go anywhere and suddenly you find all.

640
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:24,067
Speaker 0: you explore the world and find all these interesting things to poke at and Usually that's when there's a lot of side quests and things that aren't strictly necessary to win.

641
00:46:24,087 --> 00:46:34,612
Speaker 0: you can do But eventually even if you don't try to beat the game You'll poke at everything and the game sort of like guides you back toward the critical path to actually beating it Mm-hmm.

642
00:46:35,274 --> 00:46:36,036
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's part.

643
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:41,830
Speaker 1: usually the games will do that because most of them, you know, really confer like this sort of.

644
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:45,003
Speaker 1: You know, you don't see a lot of small JRPGs, right?

645
00:46:45,023 --> 00:46:46,730
Speaker 1: They're long and big right?

646
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:55,570
Speaker 1: So you're you can't really confer that sense of big and epicness to the player Without sort of opening the world to them in that way, right?

647
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:59,161
Speaker 1: So it's sort of you do the timing and fashion in which that is done.

648
00:46:59,421 --> 00:47:02,170
Speaker 0: like Final Fantasy 1 you walk around the bridge.

649
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:06,326
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get the bridge this bridge and then these credits play like to do.

650
00:47:06,426 --> 00:47:07,390
Speaker 1: Okay now the world.

651
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:11,459
Speaker 0: But then you go you're thinking okay the world.

652
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:14,910
Speaker 0: and then you find a ship and then you're like, oh the world.

653
00:47:15,354 --> 00:47:21,130
Speaker 0: But then if you try to go north There's a whole continent that doesn't have a single port and you're like wonder what's up with that?

654
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:23,229
Speaker 0: And then when you get the airship, you're like, oh I'm going up there.

655
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:25,945
Speaker 0: I've been waiting to get up there my entire childhood.

656
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:28,416
Speaker 1: here I come Yeah, or you know.

657
00:47:28,436 --> 00:47:36,750
Speaker 1: sometimes, you know, there's usually also Some point in most of them where it's a common trope to go to like a different world, right?

658
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:45,814
Speaker 1: it's like and you go to the moon or You know some sort of hell or magic land or a world of ruin Yeah, something like that.

659
00:47:45,974 --> 00:47:51,410
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, sort of it's like a terrible secret of space that you've discovered in the plot, right?

660
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:56,350
Speaker 1: Here's the truth and that's why there's always like a we call it a square boss named after the company square.

661
00:47:56,631 --> 00:48:02,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, this the bad guy that you've known the whole time that's the main bad guy Right.

662
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:02,414
Speaker 1: That's the.

663
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:04,542
Speaker 1: you think they're gonna be the final final boss.

664
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:05,225
Speaker 1: you beat them.

665
00:48:05,787 --> 00:48:11,650
Speaker 1: It's like aha It was actually to do and there's an even bigger boss and Mega Man 2 does the same thing.

666
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,839
Speaker 0: Fuck you, golly.

667
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:13,745
Speaker 0: Wait Zemus.

668
00:48:13,806 --> 00:48:14,309
Speaker 0: What's that?

669
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:15,351
Speaker 1: Right.

670
00:48:15,411 --> 00:48:22,001
Speaker 1: It's like you beat Wiley and then it's like another skull and then you fight this robot alien Wiley spoilers for Mega Man 2.

671
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:32,705
Speaker 1: It was Exactly while he was controlling the alien robot with remote control anyway And almost all the JRPGs do a very do that same exact thing.

672
00:48:32,726 --> 00:48:34,070
Speaker 1: where it's like it's this bad guy.

673
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,644
Speaker 1: No, it's actually this like god.

674
00:48:36,724 --> 00:48:37,710
Speaker 1: That's the bad guy.

675
00:48:39,012 --> 00:48:43,150
Speaker 1: Some guy, you know from more some elder, you know thing from another dimension.

676
00:48:43,471 --> 00:48:47,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, true evil, but another very true evil is just a guy.

677
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:52,530
Speaker 1: It's like actually he had this much power and possessed by ten demons.

678
00:48:53,731 --> 00:49:00,569
Speaker 0: But there's also epic ending these games because they're not usually real time or time like like.

679
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:12,727
Speaker 0: there's no dexterity component to them sometimes like obviously a lot of exceptions and but There's grinding and leveling up as a mechanic and especially the early ones.

680
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:21,217
Speaker 0: for a long time That was a primary mechanic and this is where like as a reviewer on one hand Like I don't got time for that shit in my adult life.

681
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:27,987
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, I cannot ignore the fact that that was Extremely satisfying to me when I was younger.

682
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:38,630
Speaker 0: Like if you got I'm I would like not you haven't become bored of it yet Yep, I would like walk back and forth next to elf land like fighting trolls to get that silver sword.

683
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:43,288
Speaker 0: I was enjoying every second of that like I can't pretend I didn't.

684
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:45,961
Speaker 0: it's not like I sprang forth from Zeus.

685
00:49:46,302 --> 00:49:54,330
Speaker 1: knowing that grinding is bad For me, it wasn't that I enjoyed the grinding is that I was more tolerant of it in those days.

686
00:49:54,571 --> 00:50:04,101
Speaker 1: And then the reward of getting the silver sword finally affording it and then just mowing down people with the silver sword Yeah, that reward was so satisfying.

687
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:04,804
Speaker 1: It was worth.

688
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:06,249
Speaker 0: it was almost like the pain.

689
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,957
Speaker 0: We've talked about this in panels before.

690
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:13,676
Speaker 0: a certain amount of pain like say a super meat boy Increases the pleasure of completion.

691
00:50:13,716 --> 00:50:18,650
Speaker 0: the pain just can't be too deep but when we were young we had an infinite capacity for that kind of pain.

692
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:27,007
Speaker 1: exactly You know, but yeah, it's like that mechanic of random encounters as bad and lazy as it is now.

693
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:30,309
Speaker 1: It's like there is Something to it, right?

694
00:50:31,432 --> 00:50:35,590
Speaker 1: You know to sort of fill if you you know, it's like if you just took that out completely.

695
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:37,350
Speaker 1: Right, it's like okay.

696
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:46,559
Speaker 1: Well now if there's no random encounters then the fun parts I like for example like getting items Right going shopping learning magic spells.

697
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,124
Speaker 1: Those have lost all meaning now.

698
00:50:48,224 --> 00:50:48,986
Speaker 1: It's like who cares?

699
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:52,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want to learn I don't want to get items anymore.

700
00:50:52,437 --> 00:50:55,447
Speaker 1: I don't care about getting gold because there's no random encounters - right.

701
00:50:55,548 --> 00:51:05,934
Speaker 1: It's like They put this bad thing in the game That's unfun in order to make it fun to get things to make the unfun part Go away.

702
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:10,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like the goal of capitalism is to escape capitalism.

703
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:11,252
Speaker 1: Right.

704
00:51:11,272 --> 00:51:16,829
Speaker 1: The goal of the JRPG is to escape the horrible random encounters that they're not a problem anymore.

705
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:20,424
Speaker 1: earthbound I think did really great where if you bump into a bad guy, that's too easy.

706
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,790
Speaker 1: You just automatically win.

707
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:35,341
Speaker 0: Yeah I think it should have been a little more liberal with that because its rule was if that enemy could not hurt you in any Way if it could possibly do even one damage you have to fight it Exactly, but you could usually kill it in one shot.

708
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:36,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the case.

709
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:45,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was really weak Yep But some of them like Final Fantasy 4 was always interesting to me in that the random encounters Was what was a resource game?

710
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:56,886
Speaker 0: Like do I have enough resources to get to the next like checkpoint, but then the boss fights were actually kind of like serious puzzles More so than a lot of other JRPGs I had played and that is a common theme of.

711
00:51:56,926 --> 00:52:08,016
Speaker 0: the bosses will have Complexity that is a combination of knowledge and skill of how to deal with them based on what level you're at and what you've got and I always found that really satisfying.

712
00:52:08,056 --> 00:52:18,630
Speaker 0: like I think the reason Final Fantasy 4 has such a relatively large Randomizer scene like as small as it is like it's the biggest of the RPG randomizer scenes that I can see.

713
00:52:19,172 --> 00:52:36,670
Speaker 0: I think it's because it's basically a boss rush and the bosses in Final Fantasy 4 were really interesting Especially compared to other similar JRPGs from the era Final Fantasy 4 came out The the better JRPGs definitely, you know have more complex or interesting combat systems.

714
00:52:37,052 --> 00:52:39,630
Speaker 1: To you know, some of them good some of them bad, right?

715
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,427
Speaker 1: Everyone's different and I can get into all the different ones like.

716
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:48,001
Speaker 0: honestly Maybe I'll complain about Final Fantasy 8 but Combat I didn't find fun.

717
00:52:48,243 --> 00:52:49,610
Speaker 0: I liked everything else about that game.

718
00:52:50,732 --> 00:53:06,901
Speaker 1: But the point is the good ones usually have some sort of Puzzly element where it's not just do your highest DPS attack heal when you're low repeat and Usually they'll be structured in such a way to where you know.

719
00:53:07,463 --> 00:53:08,546
Speaker 1: sure they're all.

720
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:24,792
Speaker 1: if it has leveling up Mathematically, it's always going to be possible to grind and level up so much given enough time to blow past any amount of puzzles And just beat every guy right that which it's always a way possible in Final Fantasy 6.

721
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:25,715
Speaker 0: That's what I did.

722
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:30,610
Speaker 0: my endgame and I'll add Final Fantasy 6 was just four characters casting Ultima constantly.

723
00:53:31,661 --> 00:53:33,594
Speaker 1: right You know, it's like.

724
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:36,750
Speaker 1: that's always gonna be possible as long as leveling up as a thing.

725
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:50,900
Speaker 1: But the good JRPGs the ones that are better will have some sort of way where if you're clever and you figure it out Then you can with much less resources with much less grinding Find a way through right?

726
00:53:51,222 --> 00:54:05,518
Speaker 0: Oh if I'm clever and I use this You know and sometimes it's like He's healing herself serious boss late-game keeps healing herself cast wall on her Like yep, that's a clever bit.

727
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,706
Speaker 0: I remember I didn't figure that out on my own.

728
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:15,083
Speaker 1: someone told me Now some of that stuff I think a lot of it actually ends up just being Knowledge and not really skill like I said.

729
00:54:15,223 --> 00:54:16,730
Speaker 0: someone told me I didn't figure it out.

730
00:54:16,911 --> 00:54:17,934
Speaker 1: It's like did you?

731
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:19,780
Speaker 1: if you know it then you know it.

732
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:22,670
Speaker 1: it's not are you good enough, right?

733
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,149
Speaker 1: It's like just do you know a thing?

734
00:54:24,671 --> 00:54:29,770
Speaker 1: It's like a not, you know, if you have some knowledge well now you can grind less because you know a secret, right?

735
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,728
Speaker 1: It's like okay great, you know, it's not very satisfying.

736
00:54:32,788 --> 00:54:37,650
Speaker 1: Yeah But at least it's better than just yeah, the only way through is grinding, right?

737
00:54:38,032 --> 00:54:40,187
Speaker 1: You know, it takes this many hours to beat this game.

738
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:40,943
Speaker 1: the end Yep.

739
00:54:41,352 --> 00:55:01,877
Speaker 0: But it also points out something about the way like we and like game reviewers talk Think again about like Final Fantasy 1 and like when you like you even said when you finally pick those games up They were very intuitive even though you'd never really played them before that that linear grindy relatively simple mechanism in a game Even if like say rumin Scott have outgrown it.

740
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:04,604
Speaker 0: it's worth noting that for a young rumin Scott.

741
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:09,073
Speaker 0: Those were killer mechanics Unbelievable game.

742
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:14,318
Speaker 1: like if I had those games like some years sooner, I would have been like, oh my god This is the greatest game.

743
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:14,540
Speaker 0: Yep.

744
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:20,770
Speaker 0: I was like Ridiculously obsessed with min maxing my Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games.

745
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:28,054
Speaker 0: I played all those Final Fantasy legends that ever like I just I played every RPG I could get my hands on even though really pay for me It was really just.

746
00:55:28,094 --> 00:55:31,050
Speaker 1: I wanted to know the frickin story right because they had such good.

747
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:34,809
Speaker 1: You know music and characters and stories and I wanted to you know.

748
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:38,866
Speaker 0: But I also I really wanted to know like who the were sword.

749
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:39,810
Speaker 0: What does that actually do?

750
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,109
Speaker 0: I want to go find a werewolf now and hit it with it and see what happens.

751
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:44,970
Speaker 0: Like I would want to see what things did in the game.

752
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:53,617
Speaker 0: But there was also an element that that was the era where I started to become aware that wait This is Final Fantasy 2.

753
00:55:53,617 --> 00:56:01,840
Speaker 0: But why did that nerd I met on Prodigy say it was Final Fantasy 4 And I wasn't able to figure that out until the internet either.

754
00:56:02,021 --> 00:56:03,666
Speaker 0: I learned it relatively early.

755
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:07,358
Speaker 0: I actually hosted in In the early geocities days.

756
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:14,490
Speaker 0: I had a video game magazines did not tell the secret Hosted a site that had a partially translated Final Fantasy 5 ROM.

757
00:56:15,592 --> 00:56:17,607
Speaker 0: Okay, I was really proud of that when I got it.

758
00:56:18,705 --> 00:56:22,248
Speaker 0: but Those like that era for me.

759
00:56:23,092 --> 00:56:31,089
Speaker 0: What the moment that I remember and this gets back to these games are often a little glitchy and buggy and had weird stuff That wasn't well explained at least for kids like me.

760
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:43,447
Speaker 0: It was exciting to uncover to discover them and try to solve that mystery because I got a summon That you're not supposed to be able to get in Final Fantasy 2 because it's part it was removed into.

761
00:56:43,467 --> 00:57:07,590
Speaker 0: it was only in four But in an SNES cartridge, there's glitches and things where you might get some of those summons for Rydia and I got it and I had friends who literally did not believe me that I had this summon and I'd like show it to them and they were Like amazed by it and it got into sort of that like creepypasta Unknown exploration like no one can explain this to me, which no kid today could ever experience because they were just looking up.

762
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:10,559
Speaker 0: There's no way to bring that era back.

763
00:57:10,579 --> 00:57:11,021
Speaker 0: I don't think.

764
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,850
Speaker 1: no, I don't think so either.

765
00:57:13,613 --> 00:57:16,024
Speaker 1: You need a frog fractions frog fractions.

766
00:57:16,506 --> 00:57:17,310
Speaker 0: Just go down.

767
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:24,510
Speaker 1: The frog fractions person recently tweeted that like they put frog fractions for inside of it's like what it's like.

768
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:27,547
Speaker 1: We can just decompile it though and take a look at the code.

769
00:57:27,909 --> 00:57:30,943
Speaker 1: Yeah We don't need to trust them at their word.

770
00:57:31,446 --> 00:57:32,269
Speaker 1: Just try to mess with us.

771
00:57:32,711 --> 00:57:36,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really play any modern what we would call a JRPG.

772
00:57:36,143 --> 00:57:36,725
Speaker 1: No, I don't.

773
00:57:36,826 --> 00:57:38,030
Speaker 1: I just don't have time for that.

774
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:41,021
Speaker 1: It's - what I really like and we've talked about this a bit.

775
00:57:41,061 --> 00:57:43,852
Speaker 1: when I talked about I think I geeked by did cloudpunk And I all.

776
00:57:43,872 --> 00:57:46,664
Speaker 1: we also did a show recently on heavens heavens vault.

777
00:57:46,765 --> 00:57:47,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't waste.

778
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:49,051
Speaker 1: much is Right.

779
00:57:49,292 --> 00:58:04,930
Speaker 1: It's like you can get the stir games now that are giving you parts of the RPG the parts that I like at least Right the explore the world talk to people epic plot sometimes multiple endings Right the same a chrono trigger head, right?

780
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:08,750
Speaker 1: So your choices matter some person replayability or look at a very different genre.

781
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:09,794
Speaker 0: Now they aspire.

782
00:58:09,874 --> 00:58:10,617
Speaker 0: gives me the.

783
00:58:10,938 --> 00:58:14,129
Speaker 0: here's a bunch of complicated bosses and I got to figure out how to fight them.

784
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:20,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like just that, you know, whichever part you want don't you know, I always made this analogy.

785
00:58:20,391 --> 00:58:22,039
Speaker 1: So I'll make it again where.

786
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:29,690
Speaker 1: imagine you went to the movie theater to watch Lord of the Rings and you're right or some epic movie and you watch it for like five minutes, right?

787
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,556
Speaker 1: And that was the intro.

788
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:31,926
Speaker 1: that's just like you'd even press start.

789
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:32,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

790
00:58:33,032 --> 00:58:36,846
Speaker 1: and then you know you're watching like the first scene right and then the.

791
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:43,650
Speaker 1: suddenly it pauses and In front of you there pops up like, you know, they give you like a little tablet and it's like on the tablet.

792
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:45,930
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, here are some trivia questions.

793
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:48,144
Speaker 1: Answer them correctly, right?

794
00:58:50,032 --> 00:58:56,629
Speaker 1: Or wait ten minutes and then if you answer them correctly or wait ten minutes Then we will let you watch the next scene.

795
00:58:57,051 --> 00:59:00,624
Speaker 1: Otherwise watch this death scene where the and that's the end of the movie.

796
00:59:00,664 --> 00:59:02,470
Speaker 1: the end Frodo dies, right?

797
00:59:04,214 --> 00:59:07,550
Speaker 1: And then go back to the to the quiz again, right after you're watching the death scene.

798
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:09,981
Speaker 1: And it's like if you had to watch a movie like that.

799
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,295
Speaker 1: It's like you wouldn't watch the fucking movie You'd be like.

800
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:13,170
Speaker 1: what the fuck is this bullshit?

801
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:18,749
Speaker 0: Let me watch and that's I was always annoyed like that concept of there's nothing different.

802
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:21,730
Speaker 0: Failure just prevents you from proceeding.

803
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:22,774
Speaker 0: I don't.

804
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:23,336
Speaker 0: I don't.

805
00:59:23,918 --> 00:59:28,520
Speaker 0: as an adult and as someone who introspects why I enjoy games I realize that that is.

806
00:59:28,662 --> 00:59:48,633
Speaker 0: I'm not here for that But I do recognize that for other types of gamers, especially younger gamers those mechanics that I despise Still hold value to them and that's why there's such a thriving ecosystem of fairly grindy JRPGs that even today Aren't substantially evolved from Final Fantasy 6.

807
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:50,279
Speaker 1: I mean they're evolved but they're not.

808
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,170
Speaker 1: you know, I think the fundamentals are still are still there.

809
00:59:53,251 --> 00:59:55,669
Speaker 1: They've just really polished a lot of the outer edges, right?

810
00:59:56,152 --> 01:00:15,170
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's like sometime around the college times, you know, thanks to playing Mudds in high school Right and learning things there about grinding When Wow came out and I saw people grinding there and the MMO RPGs That's when I sort of realized like hey, why can't I just play Final Fantasy 6 without this fucking ground bullshit?

811
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,026
Speaker 0: That was that was my moment too when I bounced off a Wow and I was like, wait a minute.

812
01:00:19,388 --> 01:00:20,628
Speaker 0: Wait a minute Fuck this.

813
01:00:21,191 --> 01:00:27,890
Speaker 1: No, I refuse and my opinions basically been the same since then which is like just let me fucking watch the rings.

814
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:28,111
Speaker 0: I

815
01:00:28,332 --> 01:00:30,360
Speaker 1: wanted to stop and answer your goddamn quizzes right

816
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:45,964
Speaker 0: before that like right before I went to RIT I was playing the realm and like grinding out like killing imps to get to experience points for hours and hours and hours at a time to make a number grow up and There was nothing wrong with that in my eyes for some reason.

817
01:00:46,246 --> 01:00:50,723
Speaker 0: and when I hit Wow I bounced off of it and then remember you a bunch of us at RIT got into.

818
01:00:51,024 --> 01:00:52,790
Speaker 0: uh, oh god, what was that?

819
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,174
Speaker 0: MMO that we got it.

820
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:56,480
Speaker 1: I mean I played puzzle pirates.

821
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,464
Speaker 1: That was pretty grindy.

822
01:00:57,484 --> 01:00:58,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was pretty good.

823
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,402
Speaker 1: It's not a J. Not a JRPG.

824
01:01:00,725 --> 01:01:03,034
Speaker 0: Yeah But now we play.

825
01:01:03,054 --> 01:01:04,321
Speaker 0: we played a couple of like.

826
01:01:04,462 --> 01:01:06,110
Speaker 0: we played a Korean RPG at one point.

827
01:01:06,911 --> 01:01:08,097
Speaker 1: No, Ragnarok Ragnarok.

828
01:01:08,137 --> 01:01:10,650
Speaker 1: That was the one and I just hit slimes for like a week.

829
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,621
Speaker 0: And yeah, we we both we were all grinding it.

830
01:01:12,701 --> 01:01:21,810
Speaker 0: and then we all together was like wait a minute This grind is just gonna unlock a Slightly different grind and we I think we all have a girl grind rats instead of slimes.

831
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:26,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I tried to run to the end of the game and it was just a bigger numbers grinding out bigger numbers.

832
01:01:26,231 --> 01:01:27,347
Speaker 0: There wasn't anything else there.

833
01:01:29,403 --> 01:01:35,758
Speaker 0: Yep, so yeah You know, that's That's just our thoughts on this.

834
01:01:35,979 --> 01:01:36,019
Speaker 0: I

835
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:55,884
Speaker 1: think you know, I think JRPGs these days I think what they've done especially we talked about the most popular one Pokemon Is that to sort of you know Alleviate, I don't know necessarily alleviate but to sort of appeal to a broader audience of people who may not just want to grind and Level up is they add all sorts of other things?

836
01:01:55,944 --> 01:01:57,350
Speaker 1: Dragon Quest does this also.

837
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:00,390
Speaker 0: Well, we're a lot of grinding mechanics that are not game necessary.

838
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,960
Speaker 1: Right this fashion and this side game.

839
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:07,190
Speaker 0: go grow your berries and breed berries or whatever.

840
01:02:08,014 --> 01:02:10,890
Speaker 1: All sorts of other things going on in the game.

841
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:15,184
Speaker 1: Just all sorts of systems that may or may not interact with the combat system.

842
01:02:15,224 --> 01:02:16,167
Speaker 0: Look at the game of the year.

843
01:02:16,308 --> 01:02:23,150
Speaker 0: Look at Hades dating sim dialogue tree unlocking relationships plus like action RPG.

844
01:02:24,356 --> 01:02:40,268
Speaker 1: Right exactly, you know They just put lots and lots of systems in there So that there's something for you to be interested in something for you to spend your time in something for everyone to you know do And yeah, you know eventually uncover the plot of some kind right.

845
01:02:40,329 --> 01:02:40,529
Speaker 1: so?

846
01:02:41,711 --> 01:02:45,222
Speaker 1: And I do think you know regardless of any other negative things about them.

847
01:02:45,342 --> 01:02:53,746
Speaker 1: game wise, you know the plots characters You know stories of a lot of JRPGs are still really kind of epic and awesome.

848
01:02:53,766 --> 01:03:01,289
Speaker 1: a lot of the time not all the time But a lot of the time and I really enjoy those kinds of stories and I'd love to like watch them on YouTube As opposed to playing them.

849
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:10,346
Speaker 1: Yep, right because then I can get that story while without wasting such a large portion of my life Just pushing a and waiting for the next, you know to get to the next town.

850
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:12,754
Speaker 0: Yeah What I wonder?

851
01:03:12,775 --> 01:03:18,515
Speaker 0: I suspect we wouldn't feel differently because if we didn't have jobs But somehow didn't need money.

852
01:03:18,535 --> 01:03:25,642
Speaker 0: I think we would fill that vacuum trivially, but I do wonder if we had a lot of free time Would we be more tolerant?

853
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:26,609
Speaker 0: I think the answer is no.

854
01:03:28,335 --> 01:03:36,520
Speaker 1: I might be more tolerant in that, you know, as long as it was a You know an easier one right one.

855
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,330
Speaker 1: that didn't, you know, it depends on exactly how long it takes, right?

856
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:41,269
Speaker 1: It's like I might be able to get through.

857
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,574
Speaker 1: You know cuz like.

858
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:47,810
Speaker 1: I've played a Pokemon games recently and I usually get like a few gyms in and then stop, right?

859
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:50,833
Speaker 1: I haven't beaten one since like Maybe.

860
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:51,316
Speaker 1: well

861
01:03:51,336 --> 01:04:03,750
Speaker 0: like they're not that long ago like during kovid I just like fired up Final Fantasy 1 in an emulator because I was trying to test something and Before I knew it I'd beaten garland and the bridge appeared and I was like wait wait rim you're actually playing stop.

862
01:04:04,272 --> 01:04:05,076
Speaker 0: I had to catch myself.

863
01:04:05,096 --> 01:04:16,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played final fantasy 7 came out on Steam Maybe a few years ago because I and I went and I played that like alright I'll give this game one more shot, right and I went and I played it and I got through.

864
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:32,421
Speaker 1: I was having a good time going through seeing stuff I'd already seen before going through and then Suddenly I got farther than I'd ever gotten before and the world like opened up into this enormous world outside the town And I didn't even know the game got that big And I was like what the fuck is this?

865
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:34,570
Speaker 1: I don't have time for this.

866
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:38,016
Speaker 1: And then I stopped playing as soon as that.

867
01:04:38,056 --> 01:04:44,581
Speaker 1: that was just so overwhelming to have that such big world open up and Realize the game was gonna be that long and that made me stop playing.

868
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:51,962
Speaker 0: Well, that's that that rudderless moment assumes that you have like gotten invested in the game enough to where you're.

869
01:04:52,002 --> 01:04:57,994
Speaker 0: like Hooked you before that rudderless moment.

870
01:04:58,355 --> 01:04:59,257
Speaker 0: I think that's the moment.

871
01:04:59,397 --> 01:05:08,374
Speaker 0: Most people would just bounce off of a game Like if you weren't feeling Final Fantasy 1. as soon as you get that airship, you'll be like, oh, there are way too many things up North.

872
01:05:08,435 --> 01:05:08,759
Speaker 0: I'm done.

873
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:09,185
Speaker 0: I'm out.

874
01:05:10,303 --> 01:05:12,052
Speaker 1: Yep All right.

875
01:05:12,092 --> 01:05:14,220
Speaker 1: So yeah the future of JRPGs.

876
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,003
Speaker 1: I think they're just.

877
01:05:15,484 --> 01:05:17,130
Speaker 0: you know, I keep on evolving.

878
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:24,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not paying enough attention to the scene to know like what the developments are and what.

879
01:05:24,328 --> 01:05:28,571
Speaker 0: I don't even finish Pokemon games these days right as an outsider Right.

880
01:05:29,235 --> 01:05:40,496
Speaker 1: It just looks like they sort of keep doing You know the same old same old only, you know freshening and advancing and expanding but not really Revolutionizing, right?

881
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,010
Speaker 1: It's like here's another Final Fantasy.

882
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:51,893
Speaker 1: It's a lot like the other Final Fantasy's only better graphics bigger fancier new combat system more things to do Etc.

883
01:05:52,154 --> 01:05:52,335
Speaker 1: Right.

884
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:56,070
Speaker 1: This one is different because it's what dudes pushing a car or something, right?

885
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,750
Speaker 1: Who is that was one of the recent ish ones?

886
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:02,633
Speaker 1: I guess that one's probably old by now right knowing how old I am You know.

887
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:04,722
Speaker 1: and then they just they do how they do it.

888
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:10,378
Speaker 1: I guess there's still an audience for it And it's you know, it's just not it was.

889
01:06:10,398 --> 01:06:14,169
Speaker 1: it sort of is and isn't for me at the same time, right?

890
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:26,997
Speaker 0: Yep, that's part of why I'm playing these randomizers because I get to scratch that itch that's still there buried But it's a very concentrated experience that ends quickly and it's just like I'm mainlining.

891
01:06:27,057 --> 01:06:39,833
Speaker 0: the part of those games that I like the most which for Final Fantasies was Especially Final Fantasy's foreign earlier was the boss rush as of Andy like looting more so than the plots Really?

892
01:06:39,873 --> 01:06:44,410
Speaker 0: It was Final Fantasy 6 and chrono trigger where I was more invested in the characters than I was in the game mechanics.
