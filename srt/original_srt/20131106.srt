1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,969
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, November 6th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:12,431
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:14,516
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights coming to.

4
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,120
Speaker 0: you live from ice cream prison.

5
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:21,619
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about the possible anime Renaissance that may or may not be happening.

6
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:25,096
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:28,770
Speaker 0: That sounds like something out of an adventure time.

8
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:30,278
Speaker 0: what ice cream prison?

9
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,860
Speaker 0: I Just.

10
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:33,587
Speaker 0: I get this impression that you're clever.

11
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:38,247
Speaker 1: the banana guards take your clever pump-and-dump stock scheme Clever.

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,819
Speaker 1: it's an of the oldest scheme in the book.

13
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:46,900
Speaker 1: I Suspect that it would only be clever if I somehow came up with something new that they didn't already exist laws to prevent.

14
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:59,700
Speaker 1: I just get this impression that minimum security prison is not quite as fun as ice cream prison, dude I heard stories that are totally true about like you know white-collar criminals go into the lowest security prison.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,955
Speaker 1: We're basically you play ping-pong eat ice cream.

16
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:03,618
Speaker 1: Just hang out.

17
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:14,371
Speaker 1: all day You can even just like walk out and walk back in like there isn't even like bars or anything to keep you in and It's like being a house arrest in a kind of nice house.

18
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:16,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what if you want to go to PAX?

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,577
Speaker 1: You got packs probably not.

20
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:21,796
Speaker 0: They're not gonna let you out to go to PAX.

21
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:22,260
Speaker 1: That's all right.

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,779
Speaker 1: I'll just have to go to jail from between the two paxes.

23
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:29,758
Speaker 0: I have a feeling if you go to prison as opposed to jail you're not gonna be there a short enough span.

24
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:32,012
Speaker 0: do not miss At least one of the paxes.

25
00:01:32,476 --> 00:01:34,399
Speaker 0: four months All right.

26
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:40,623
Speaker 0: So when you go to the sentencing be like look I'm guilty, but I can really only stay Serving my sentence in April and get out in August.

27
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:40,844
Speaker 1: Thanks.

28
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,285
Speaker 1: That'd be nice.

29
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:54,298
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's Wednesday, and I just noticed that there is yet another initial d-movie coming.

30
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:57,466
Speaker 0: it looks like Pilot video for something.

31
00:01:57,506 --> 00:02:01,160
Speaker 0: No one else is LD the new initial d-movie.

32
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:03,276
Speaker 1: Is the initially manga still going?

33
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:03,720
Speaker 1: is it over?

34
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:09,505
Speaker 1: I actually don't know if I actually bought every volume of the initial d-monger released in English But they didn't finish it.

35
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,700
Speaker 1: so I didn't finish it and I didn't go get scans lations or anything.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,075
Speaker 0: Oh the manga ended a couple months ago in July a few months ago, so there's.

37
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:20,194
Speaker 1: no oh, that's nice But how am I supposed to get the rest of it scans lations or something?

38
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:21,018
Speaker 0: I don't know.

39
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:27,100
Speaker 0: yeah I didn't even watch all a fourth stage like I as much as I didn't even watch the first movie.

40
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,380
Speaker 1: I watched the initial state the first stage in the second stage, and I read all the manga that was officially legally released.

41
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,880
Speaker 0: I watched that awful live-action movie.

42
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:40,183
Speaker 0: It was.

43
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:43,432
Speaker 0: we should review that on good nights, you know what reviewed it right now.

44
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:44,254
Speaker 0: It sucks.

45
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:46,240
Speaker 0: It is so bad.

46
00:02:50,054 --> 00:03:00,059
Speaker 0: But But the reason I bring this up is that I like initial D a lot because it's super dumb And it has eurobeat and cars.

47
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,287
Speaker 0: Super eurobeat not just eurobeat.

48
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:05,233
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna watch some eurobeat trash.

49
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:06,638
Speaker 0: It's got to be super eurobeat.

50
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:07,019
Speaker 0: I don't care.

51
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:16,419
Speaker 0: This trailer or this pilot I guess Does not have super eurobeat music, but some other kind of music.

52
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:19,447
Speaker 0: And well now while how is that?

53
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,289
Speaker 1: it's not initial D.

54
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:27,398
Speaker 0: now while the trailer does show this really cool manga looking shader that actually Looks real like the cars look really cool.

55
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:36,186
Speaker 0: Unless someone makes some sort of fan edit that just plays running in the 90s on a loop in the background instead of this music I'm not gonna watch this movie.

56
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:39,156
Speaker 1: The only reason to watch initially anime is eurobeat music.

57
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:42,079
Speaker 1: without eurobeat music I don't even consider it to be initial D.

58
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,919
Speaker 0: It's some sort of imposter D and to be honest all the initial D after season one.

59
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:49,494
Speaker 0: No, unless you're really like me and Scott.

60
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:50,519
Speaker 0: It's not that great.

61
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,807
Speaker 1: Wasn't that great in season one cookie cutter bad animation.

62
00:03:55,967 --> 00:04:02,093
Speaker 0: season one at least has a Pretty good story arc for the main character.

63
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:03,880
Speaker 0: It has that scene where he washes the car.

64
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:05,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about that bit.

65
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:08,112
Speaker 0: at the end it season one is almost a show.

66
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:10,438
Speaker 0: doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

67
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:12,176
Speaker 1: Okay, anyway, I'll miss it.

68
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:21,579
Speaker 0: And one other very small thing for any of you who are dumb enough to not see Wolf Children yet in the theater You can go see it in the theater.

69
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,899
Speaker 0: I'm linking to the anime news network thing.

70
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:30,780
Speaker 0: But the tug is selling a bunch of tickets to showings with the idea that a certain percentage of the tickets have to be sold.

71
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:32,746
Speaker 0: Or the showing doesn't happen.

72
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:33,308
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

73
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:48,320
Speaker 0: So there's showings everywhere in New York in New York, but not oh my god, even Montana even fucking Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, Omaha, Nebraska, so literally the fuck middle of nowhere.

74
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,385
Speaker 1: This is your chance.

75
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:50,531
Speaker 1: people who live in the sticks.

76
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:55,577
Speaker 1: the one time a city folk Will give some of our Kansas, Illinois.

77
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:58,059
Speaker 1: Where the hell is that?

78
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,548
Speaker 1: Delah, I never even heard of that place.

79
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:03,380
Speaker 0: Oh, there's one in Huntsville, Alabama, but there's no tickets for that one.

80
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely don't go there.

81
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:08,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you live there, I guess even if you live there just kill yourself.

82
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:12,929
Speaker 0: I've been to Alabama was like when were you in Alabama?

83
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:14,414
Speaker 0: I went to space camp.

84
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,557
Speaker 1: That was in Alabama.

85
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:19,992
Speaker 0: Yeah in Houston There's multiple space places.

86
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:27,540
Speaker 0: I thought it was in Houston anyway, anyway, so Wolf children dub subbed and you can go see in the theater.

87
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:33,571
Speaker 0: It is an amazing movie and you if you're an anime fan at all You should see this movie and it's worth seeing in the theater.

88
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,394
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

89
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:36,040
Speaker 0: I think we reviewed it at one point.

90
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:37,034
Speaker 0: Go listen to that episode.

91
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:46,795
Speaker 1: Sure Okay, so, you know normally I don't just like to do kickstarters for news or whatever or something like that because it's sort of just Too easy and you could just do that all.

92
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:47,400
Speaker 1: goddamn day.

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I'm wearing my kickstarter belt and I gotta tell you it really sucks for all of you who didn't kickstart this belt.

94
00:05:52,921 --> 00:06:05,249
Speaker 1: Sure, but there is a particular kickstarter that is particularly fascinating right fan of graphics One of the best comic book publishers in the United States Publisher of graphic novels and books and all kinds of good stuff.

95
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:08,939
Speaker 1: They I buy a lot of fanta graphics things that you do.

96
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,714
Speaker 1: They are doing a kickstarter and it's strangely enough.

97
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:16,144
Speaker 1: There's nothing on the kickstarter I actually want.

98
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:20,177
Speaker 1: so I'm probably not gonna kick it but maybe I'll do the $1 situation.

99
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:24,491
Speaker 0: I have never done the plus one kickstarter before.

100
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,055
Speaker 0: I've only ever kickstarted to get a thing.

101
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:27,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's really nothing I want.

102
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:28,379
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll just do one.

103
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:33,701
Speaker 0: I got to give a lot of money to be in puppycat even though I don't need any of those things just to give them More money.

104
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:41,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're doing basically their entire 2014 spring season Kickstart 39 graphic novels and books.

105
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:48,655
Speaker 1: So they're trying to fund right their Entire season of publishing via Kickstarter.

106
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:53,854
Speaker 1: They have currently have 90,000 out of a hundred and fifty thousand with 28 days left.

107
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:54,958
Speaker 1: I think they're gonna make it.

108
00:06:54,998 --> 00:07:10,000
Speaker 1: guys Yeah, you can get a lot of comics that you cannot get anywhere else or you know pre-order basically a bunch of stuff that may be signed or Who knows what right pretty much anything in the spring catalog?

109
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:26,597
Speaker 1: So highly recommended if you are someone who cares about the indie comics in the u.s and you want I think fanta graphics had like a situation where like one of the top people passed away and That's the reason that they're basically doing it this way or something.

110
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:32,020
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll see All right, so Yeah, this is like one of my favorite publishers.

111
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:36,680
Speaker 0: So speaking of Kickstarters, it's close to its goal, but not there yet.

112
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,613
Speaker 0: So since I mentioned it the bean puppycat Kickstarter one.

113
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:41,180
Speaker 0: if you haven't watched be in puppycat.

114
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:43,949
Speaker 0: It doesn't need a whole geek nights episode to review.

115
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:44,631
Speaker 0: just watch it.

116
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,554
Speaker 0: It's on YouTube.

117
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:46,336
Speaker 0: the whole thing.

118
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:46,818
Speaker 1: It's good.

119
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:47,500
Speaker 1: I like it.

120
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:52,967
Speaker 1: I just don't like it as much as adventure time Or bravest warriors.

121
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:58,420
Speaker 0: I if I had to put them in order for me it's adventure time being puppycat.

122
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,183
Speaker 0: Bravest warriors.

123
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:03,112
Speaker 1: the bravest warriors has this totally freaky.

124
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,757
Speaker 1: What the hell is going on with this emotion?

125
00:08:04,797 --> 00:08:09,607
Speaker 0: Oh, don't get me wrong like Warriors horse other dimension.

126
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:12,336
Speaker 0: We're talking about if this is a terrible secret of space.

127
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:16,000
Speaker 0: if this is the graph of things I like they're like millimeters apart from each other.

128
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,400
Speaker 1: I'm just saying being puppycat is behind for me because it lacks the terrible secret of space.

129
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:37,285
Speaker 1: if it somehow gets a terrible secret of space then maybe It'll elevate so the terrible secret of the monster inside of Puppycat and the warlock quite as mysterious as the emotion Lord and he's it's himself from the future Coming back to visit in there.

130
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,672
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're where their parents go.

131
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:40,620
Speaker 0: That's really really straightforward.

132
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:44,680
Speaker 0: Anyway, these things are all great.

133
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,262
Speaker 0: Refrigerator is great and the bean puppycat Kickstarter as of now is about four grand shy of its goal and only has about seven days Left to go.

134
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:52,664
Speaker 0: Also.

135
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:55,212
Speaker 1: What is up with them and combining animals?

136
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:56,777
Speaker 1: puppycat cat bug.

137
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:57,719
Speaker 1: What's what's next?

138
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,959
Speaker 1: What's next seriously?

139
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,420
Speaker 0: Whatever the series they come up with next is well Scott you realize that was a big part of the original avatar.

140
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:05,801
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

141
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:07,227
Speaker 0: You never watched avatar did you?

142
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:12,004
Speaker 1: bravest warriors has two of them and has cat bug and impassa bear Impassa bear.

143
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:29,080
Speaker 0: I like the best simply because of his gas-powered stick But you never watched avatar, right Because in that world every animal is actually to a combination of two animals every single one to PB.

144
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:30,390
Speaker 0: So there's one point.

145
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:31,639
Speaker 0: I forget what I think was a bear.

146
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:34,368
Speaker 0: They're like, oh that's a bear and someone's like a bear.

147
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:35,131
Speaker 0: what like?

148
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,160
Speaker 0: I think it's just a bear and they're like, that's weird.

149
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:46,834
Speaker 1: So if every animal in their whole world is a combo of two animals Why would how could they even know about a single animal?

150
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:48,680
Speaker 1: those would be single animals to them?

151
00:09:48,860 --> 00:10:01,903
Speaker 0: Ah now in the past I would have pointed that out just like you have but having watched all of it and having thought about It there's a pretty easy answer if there's bear cat bear wolf bear lion and bear owl as opposed to all bear Then

152
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:02,565
Speaker 1: from

153
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:08,479
Speaker 0: that set of combined animals you can extract using Algebra the bear part.

154
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:20,989
Speaker 0: So you could you could basically Reverse engineer what a bear is from the fact that there are so many animals that are bear something By Kate taking the combined and median of those animal.

155
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,600
Speaker 1: Okay, sure, but let's let's pretend in the real world right eagle?

156
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:25,645
Speaker 1: Okay.

157
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:28,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, so let's say you see an animal somewhere.

158
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:31,356
Speaker 1: What animal would you consider to be?

159
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:31,859
Speaker 1: an eeg?

160
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:49,512
Speaker 0: But that's just one animal Right, but it Alright, but to you right to them It would also be one animal because I live in a world where every but they noticed that bear lion bear cat bear dog And bear rat have these sort of fundamental similarities.

161
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:54,239
Speaker 0: So they gave them all the same name bear something as opposed to cat something.

162
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,652
Speaker 1: well eagle and Eeg.

163
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:04,386
Speaker 0: At some point you should watch that show.

164
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:05,288
Speaker 0: it's actually worth watching.

165
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:09,260
Speaker 1: catfish and catfish and goldfish have similarities.

166
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:12,437
Speaker 1: so what would you consider to be a gold?

167
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:14,480
Speaker 0: What about sea lion?

168
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,867
Speaker 1: Yeah, what about sea lion?

169
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,172
Speaker 0: Not much like a lie.

170
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:19,900
Speaker 1: Anyway, what would a sea look like?

171
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:29,129
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

172
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:34,806
Speaker 0: Our good friend Judith you may know her from the internet shared this with us.

173
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:37,957
Speaker 1: Normally, I saw it before she shared it.

174
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,341
Speaker 1: cuz I'm all internet II.

175
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:41,186
Speaker 0: I saw it from her and other.

176
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:44,133
Speaker 0: because I don't check my Twitter Constantly.

177
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:45,220
Speaker 1: I check it constantly.

178
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,989
Speaker 0: I saw it from multiple sources My brain and I did not analyze where it came from first.

179
00:11:51,551 --> 00:12:04,770
Speaker 0: But this is kind of amazing in that if this were a show I would watch it only if one The characters never spoke dialogue and two music like that was playing the entire time.

180
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:07,418
Speaker 0: This needs like a 26 episode treatment.

181
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,364
Speaker 0: This is just my little pony.

182
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:18,650
Speaker 0: friendship is manly and That slow-mo walk in and then when Pinkie Pie like makes that gesture with his hand hurt its hand enter my door.

183
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:18,873
Speaker 0: It's.

184
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:19,808
Speaker 0: it's so perfect.

185
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:24,850
Speaker 0: Few things are in my wheelhouse as much as this thing is sure.

186
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:29,075
Speaker 1: Okay, so anyone who doesn't know Recently was like a week ago.

187
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:34,330
Speaker 1: ish maybe a few days ago was the YouTube Music Awards the first ever, right?

188
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,720
Speaker 1: I guess they're trying to compete with the Grammys or something like that.

189
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,150
Speaker 1: Who knows every award show is the high school award show, right?

190
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:42,188
Speaker 1: That's how they say it.

191
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,250
Speaker 1: But the YouTube Music Awards was somewhat unique in that number one.

192
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:57,609
Speaker 1: The award show itself was even more high school award show and if you'd actually watched any of it Which I watched barely any of it a lot of cringe-worthy activity going on there just sort of like it.

193
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:04,850
Speaker 1: but The awards were not given out by some sort of record industry vote or anything like that.

194
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:19,010
Speaker 1: It was primarily done by fans sharing videos and the way it worked is for each nominee in each category You there was a specific video uploaded to YouTube and the more that specific video was shared that basically counted as a vote.

195
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:27,270
Speaker 1: So if you went and found the video of the one you wanted to vote for and shared it on Twitter or shared it on Google+ with the YouTube share button that counted as a vote.

196
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:36,240
Speaker 1: so we're gonna see basically who has a the biggest fan base or B who has the craziest most dedicated fan base.

197
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:47,695
Speaker 1: that is going to you know, vote the most times and interestingly enough right girls generation 1 by a Hojillion share.

198
00:13:47,735 --> 00:14:02,032
Speaker 1: if you look at the numbers that people have posted in various places they won by some gigantic enormous amount compared to like super famous people who are actually known in North America Yeah like Lady Gaga and whatnot Right.

199
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:07,210
Speaker 1: and this video is hilarious because she Tiffany goes up to get the award and the audience is like what?

200
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,023
Speaker 1: Like they're not even clapping.

201
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:09,630
Speaker 1: They don't even know what?

202
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:17,610
Speaker 0: I remember a time when this crazy Korean song about Gangnam style was making the rounds and normal people.

203
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:23,125
Speaker 1: Funny enough sigh was a competing nominee with his gentleman video.

204
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:25,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, which not as good as Gangnam style though Good.

205
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:25,863
Speaker 0: I like it.

206
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,538
Speaker 0: I like it too, but not as plus that video.

207
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:30,384
Speaker 1: the girl in that video is song got in.

208
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:31,950
Speaker 1: who is the awesomest anyway?

209
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:40,938
Speaker 0: But remember when Gangnam style became the most popular video on YouTube or the most watched video on YouTube By such a ridiculous margin.

210
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:47,340
Speaker 0: normal people who noticed that it finally got past all these Bieber videos Didn't understand they were like.

211
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,750
Speaker 0: what the fuck is this Korean thing?

212
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,918
Speaker 1: Those are TV people not internet people.

213
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:56,530
Speaker 1: right the kpop has the sort of unique thing into where it's like sigh.

214
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,896
Speaker 1: Why did he become crazy popular?

215
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,030
Speaker 1: because he put his video on YouTube his YouTube channel, right?

216
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,116
Speaker 1: It's like these people.

217
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:05,906
Speaker 1: they just put all their shit on YouTube and they don't give a fuck.

218
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:09,216
Speaker 1: you can embed it Unlike that vivo nonsense, right?

219
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:10,119
Speaker 1: They can do everything.

220
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, Gangnam style has got almost 2 billion views.

221
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,230
Speaker 0: Yeah billion.

222
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:22,401
Speaker 1: something interesting is that you know the What's it called this this particular girls generation video.

223
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:27,589
Speaker 1: while it's not like their best song or anything even fans will tell you It's not their best song or anything, right?

224
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,012
Speaker 0: Or anything.

225
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:34,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, the it was in terms of the rate of watches like when it first went up.

226
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:38,446
Speaker 1: It got like something like the rate of what you know.

227
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:44,170
Speaker 1: views immediately I think is the fastest ever to like, you know reach some point or something, right?

228
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,173
Speaker 0: Well, that was the most.

229
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:48,948
Speaker 0: it was the fastest whatever to something something basically people were.

230
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:51,930
Speaker 1: so I forget the statistic was because they can't find it right now.

231
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,857
Speaker 1: I was typing in and trying to find it and I couldn't.

232
00:15:53,997 --> 00:16:03,290
Speaker 1: but basically in terms of you're measuring like how Rapidly all the fans immediately watched it, you know in terms of the time it went up, right?

233
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:10,339
Speaker 1: They all jumped on it to watch it immediately, right which shows, you know, the fan base for the kpop is so rabid right.

234
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,597
Speaker 1: And that's why they won this.

235
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,890
Speaker 1: because basically people are sitting there spamming shares.

236
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:21,699
Speaker 0: Yep, but the reaction Scott and I were looking at this before the show the reactions of people who were like what some Korean thing What the fuck?

237
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:22,529
Speaker 0: What about my Bieber?

238
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically the YouTube comments are hilarious because you can see.

239
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:32,099
Speaker 1: basically these North American people have no fuck clue What this is because they don't internet.

240
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,173
Speaker 1: but it's like look first of all, you don't internet So you don't know what the hell this is.

241
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:41,709
Speaker 1: and to you realize that you know, they're bigger in Asia than beaver is here.

242
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,530
Speaker 1: Yeah in Asia, there's like three people to every one person in North America.

243
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,899
Speaker 1: Nevermind welcome to the world.

244
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,570
Speaker 0: never mind the fact that there's not a worldly human.

245
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:57,470
Speaker 0: There's a not insignificant number of people in America and North American English speakers who also do know what it is.

246
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,390
Speaker 0: Yep, because they're internet people and are probably more fans of that than they are of Miley Cyrus or whatever.

247
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:06,942
Speaker 0: This reminds me so much of Mike tool.

248
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:10,920
Speaker 0: whenever soccer is on TV in the u.s He retweets because what happens is it?

249
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:18,950
Speaker 1: basically what happens in the u.s Is if football is on but where you live doesn't get any football games or an NBC only has a football game at night.

250
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:33,890
Speaker 1: So during the football times on Sunday between 1 and you know 8 or 7 Certain channels NBC and even CBS or Fox if you don't have a football game in your area Where it's blacked out or who knows what you're gonna see soccer.

251
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:35,114
Speaker 1: That's what they show.

252
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:42,335
Speaker 0: but Mike tool will retweet these people who are saying basically the fuck Soccer on TV.

253
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:47,890
Speaker 0: What how oh my god, like they can't believe that soccer is on TV.

254
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:53,430
Speaker 1: Yes Why don't you come person who lives in the sticks and has never seen soccer to the park near my house?

255
00:17:54,013 --> 00:18:09,419
Speaker 1: Over in the flushing where oh my god It's completely 100% filled with people playing soccer every moment where no one is working All the time every day all day and they're gonna even build like a soccer stadium there They want to anyway because there's so much soccer this

256
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:09,921
Speaker 0: moment.

257
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:12,650
Speaker 0: that Scott's thing of the day is actually kind of important because it should.

258
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:26,851
Speaker 0: basically, we know that there's a disconnect between sort of standard pop culture and internet pop culture, but it Really shows the Extreme starkness of that divide that I don't think.

259
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:28,620
Speaker 0: is that apparent to a lot of people?

260
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:33,840
Speaker 0: No, I mean a lot of people I know Literally had never heard of Miley Cyrus.

261
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:35,303
Speaker 0: Like there's this.

262
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:43,075
Speaker 0: there's no connection between and actually when we watch the contenders and these awards I actually did not recognize some of those groups.

263
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:47,060
Speaker 1: No People or whoever they have that video you watch didn't show all the nominees.

264
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,140
Speaker 1: But this what this I think to keep in mind this is the top award video of the year.

265
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,580
Speaker 1: This wasn't like one of the you know, there's a prestigious award.

266
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:02,676
Speaker 1: Well, it was the top award at the show like winning, you know best movie at the Oscars Like it's the was the top award you could possibly get at this place.

267
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:03,620
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

268
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:15,120
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's relevant to you know The anime people because anime is much like kpop almost entirely an Asian but also Internet, you know fandom.

269
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:17,239
Speaker 0: So think about the things you learn from this one.

270
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:20,980
Speaker 0: Anime is still made primarily for Japan not for you, right?

271
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,920
Speaker 1: But despite the fact that anime is busy hidden from the normal pop culture, right?

272
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,584
Speaker 1: It's as hidden in the pop culture as much as kpop is right it is Ginormous it.

273
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:39,457
Speaker 0: anime is bigger than you think it is But it's only big in the sovereign nation of the internet and Asia.

274
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:42,687
Speaker 0: Yes And parts of France perhaps.

275
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:49,286
Speaker 0: so in the meta moment, I got two auspicious emails just now Ogre shipping one of them.

276
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:51,032
Speaker 1: I noticed cuz you didn't have your ogres.

277
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:53,260
Speaker 1: That's what the only thing could possibly be - am I right?

278
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,050
Speaker 0: Well - am I right?

279
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:55,635
Speaker 0: You're right.

280
00:19:55,796 --> 00:20:03,176
Speaker 0: Oh One of them is a FedEx notification saying that a 28 pound package is on its way.

281
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:09,200
Speaker 1: to my other one says rim Here is your word delivering to you a table that will take up your entire living room.

282
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,203
Speaker 1: So you can actually use that.

283
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:15,519
Speaker 0: I'm just waiting for my doorman to call and be like, yeah, there's uh, there's a tank down here.

284
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,870
Speaker 1: Actually, it's a box full of tanks.

285
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,676
Speaker 0: You need a you need a hand cart You need a Humvee.

286
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:23,059
Speaker 0: you want it?

287
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,940
Speaker 0: Do you want to purchase a storage room just to put it in without taking it?

288
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:30,680
Speaker 1: Is gonna let you borrow the thing that moved the space shuttle so you can move these tanks around?

289
00:20:31,223 --> 00:20:33,255
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'll ever even open or play this game.

290
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:35,584
Speaker 0: This was like the Legacy.

291
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:39,313
Speaker 0: I know I bought this because there wasn't much on Kickstarter back then.

292
00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:41,900
Speaker 1: I didn't buy it on purpose cuz I knew better.

293
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:43,805
Speaker 0: Ah, we'll play it at some point.

299
00:20:57,484 --> 00:21:05,820
Speaker 0: I saw a bunch of facts on people who wear normal glasses and the titanium band like on top of them as Just a ghetto hack until the prescription lenses arrived.

300
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:09,514
Speaker 1: They would told me that they would email me when they invited you and I don't have any.

301
00:21:09,555 --> 00:21:13,415
Speaker 0: they just emailed me like Just now I should get this automatic email.

302
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:14,018
Speaker 1: I don't know.

303
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:19,220
Speaker 0: together I only have seven days like you've got seven days to click on this and give us a giant pile of money.

304
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:21,509
Speaker 1: I only had 14 days to click on the invite thing.

305
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I also might just go get contacts.

306
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:26,167
Speaker 0: Just I've never done the contacts.

307
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:27,873
Speaker 1: Can I poke you in the eye?

308
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:29,639
Speaker 0: No, you cannot poke me in the eye.

309
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:31,085
Speaker 1: I'll poke you in the eye.

310
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:31,527
Speaker 1: Anyway,

311
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:47,897
Speaker 0: you know, it's kind of a crazy aside but I realized recently cuz you know, I bike a lot and bike in my whole life and that's got bikes and Emily bikes and I Realized that I've never in my life Had to deal with the problem of going so fast that there's wind in your eyes and you can't see like.

312
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:49,587
Speaker 0: I never even thought Of that as a problem.

313
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,379
Speaker 1: I don't deal with that problem.

314
00:21:52,203 --> 00:21:55,979
Speaker 1: I deal with the problem of there's shit getting in my eye from going too fast.

315
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:01,100
Speaker 1: Well, especially in like Brooklyn even like, you know, just small bits of who knows what right?

316
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,580
Speaker 1: Well, like just get on my face and whatever.

317
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,060
Speaker 1: So I that's why Google glass comes with shades and shields.

318
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:08,140
Speaker 1: The shield is a piece of just clear plastic.

319
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:11,686
Speaker 1: You can put on the Google glass to just shield your eyes So that that doesn't happen.

320
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:14,599
Speaker 1: if you want to say bike at night when sunglasses would not be a good idea.

321

Speaker 0: Yeah, also check out our awesome new forum and all our videos.

373
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,330
Speaker 1: This is on the internet.

374
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,060
Speaker 1: Our forum is pretty all the places that we live on the internet.

375
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,063
Speaker 0: our forum is pretty badass and you really should be a part Of it and you should help pay for it.

376
00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:28,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll figure out how you can pay for it soon.

377
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:29,882
Speaker 0: We haven't quite put that together yet.

378
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:38,445
Speaker 0: So we noticed something and I'm not sure if it's a real trend or not But I think it's worth talking about because so many other people are talking about it.

379
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:39,390
Speaker 1: This is rim show idea.

380
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:45,548
Speaker 0: So I remember I'd I would happily defer at any point to your show idea.

381
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:47,474
Speaker 1: my non I have no show ideas.

382
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:50,686
Speaker 0: All right, so we'll just sit here for another 30 minutes doing nothing.

383
00:25:51,509 --> 00:26:03,571
Speaker 0: So when Madoka Magica came out it caused this sort of Rekindling of interest in anime but only among a certain subset of anime fans Like.

384
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:16,150
Speaker 0: I noticed that people like me and Scott and people who either have a sort of professional interest in the anime industry Because they're journalists or something or people who are just like really into anime and watch a lot of anime.

385
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:27,130
Speaker 0: All of those people who might not have watched a lot of things very recently Watched Madoka and it's sort of like they watched it when even though they weren't otherwise watching anime.

386
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:37,770
Speaker 0: But then after Madoka was done, they pretty much just spent the next year Complaining that nothing good came out since Madoka and re-showing Madoka to people who hadn't seen it yet.

387
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:43,290
Speaker 0: So it caused this like it was like a tinder but then it faded out didn't even smolder.

388
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:50,209
Speaker 0: Then attack on Titan happened and I ignored attack on Titan like I ignore all new shows that come out.

389
00:26:50,912 --> 00:26:52,338
Speaker 0: But people kept talking about it.

390
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:54,809
Speaker 0: people kept saying it was good people kept watching it.

391
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:57,078
Speaker 0: I kept getting Fullmetal Alchemist vibes.

392
00:26:57,479 --> 00:27:00,711
Speaker 0: So we watched it and it was exactly what people said It was.

393
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:01,854
Speaker 0: it was actually pretty awesome.

394
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,237
Speaker 0: You might remember a review of it.

395
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:40,279
Speaker 0: And what I've noticed is that a lot of people Who used to who say they used to be anime fans and I hate the other this whole idea that Anime as opposed to other kinds of media, but I digress a lot of people who said that they used to be into anime But then they stopped watching it for whatever reason Started watching it again because of attack on Titan like they went and got accounts on crunchyroll to watch attack on Titan because all their friends told them to watch attack on Titan and It started causing this cycle and suddenly a ton of people were watching anime again.

396
00:27:41,123 --> 00:28:01,298
Speaker 0: And I think a secondary thing happened to where I think a lot of those people Started watching crunchyroll to see attack on Titan and as soon as it ended They'd kind of gotten used to watching anime again, and it just so happened that there's quite a few not terrible shows Also coming out on crunchyroll that they could just watch

397
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:01,760
Speaker 1: right?

398
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:14,579
Speaker 1: It's like if you and this isn't like, you know, a lot of people posted like, you know about the moe Plague or whatever red specter right and they were showing stuff like well, look, this is always existed.

399
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,712
Speaker 1: go Here's an example of you know, horrible moe from a long time ago.

400
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:19,520
Speaker 1: It just looked different, but it's always been there.

401
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:21,320
Speaker 1: It's not a new trend, right?

402
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:23,024
Speaker 1: That is not true.

403
00:28:23,164 --> 00:28:30,260
Speaker 1: go and look at like, you know, the season sheets, right all anime from a particular season All on one piece of paper, right?

404
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:36,865
Speaker 1: You know the same way those they make those JPEGs and look at it for years in like the 70s and the 80s and you Know what you're gonna see.

405
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:38,980
Speaker 1: it won't be mostly filled with moe.

406
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,316
Speaker 1: There might be something on there that you can consider an old moe or something like that, right.

407
00:28:43,637 --> 00:28:45,969
Speaker 1: or you know some old fanservice show.

408
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:56,290
Speaker 1: they existed but What you will find more often is legit shows that might have a little fanservice like some tank police And you'll find mostly kids shows.

409
00:28:57,213 --> 00:29:05,800
Speaker 1: if you look at the season sheets now There's only a few kids shows and some things that look like kids shows may also be moe shows.

410
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:07,440
Speaker 0: You may recall our episode.

411
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:21,380
Speaker 1: Number of shows that are purely fan service and whatnot are Greatly increased right and the number of shows that are of interest to anyone who's not a pervert are greatly decreased.

412
00:29:22,102 --> 00:29:32,900
Speaker 1: But if you compare say this season to a few seasons ago There is a noticeable slight increase in things that you know.

413
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,459
Speaker 1: People who are not small children or perverts might actually care about and might actually be good.

414
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:41,871
Speaker 0: now There have been little bumps like this and pretty good.

415
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:48,893
Speaker 1: It's not it's not a complete like oh my god All anime is great, but it's like oh, there's actually some animes to watch.

416
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:56,499
Speaker 1: now, you know for a cute few years They were basically no anime that I that were new that I cared about at all.

417
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:05,013
Speaker 0: now There were a couple of years a couple of seasons where there were a few good shows like we have now We have this trip like a show and then another show right is like Monica.

418
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:07,000
Speaker 0: That's a show but there was a perfect storm.

419
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:10,497
Speaker 0: Monica came out but there wasn't a lot else coming out around the same time.

420
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:16,260
Speaker 0: that would Continue to smolder or there'd be a cluster of pretty good shows, but no blockbuster.

421
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:19,760
Speaker 0: But suddenly we had this perfect storm where attack on Titan happened.

422
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:32,009
Speaker 0: It got it was in a wide enough appeal to get a lot of people watching anime again, and then a lot of those people stuck around Because there were places for them to go.

423
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:36,290
Speaker 0: I mean remember Monica ended and we were like, oh my god Let's watch more anime and there was nothing good.

424
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,779
Speaker 0: and then we started watching old anime again.

425
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:39,024
Speaker 1: But there is still.

426
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:44,240
Speaker 1: there is some B tier shows that are sort of hiding underneath that are getting some views, right?

427
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,672
Speaker 1: So people come for the attack on Titan in the kill la kill.

428
00:30:47,114 --> 00:30:48,199
Speaker 1: rich are saving anime.

429
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:50,367
Speaker 1: Space dandy is gonna follow it up.

430
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:54,060
Speaker 1: So yeah, we see some sustaining going on here, right?

431
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:01,280
Speaker 1: They're keeping the will alive with a few shows but in between it's like well look how long space brothers have been going.

432
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:02,745
Speaker 0: Oh, it's actually really good.

433
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:04,451
Speaker 0: Yeah this eccentric family.

434
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:06,740
Speaker 0: Wow, that's not like anything I've ever seen before.

435
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:13,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like there's these like second level of shows underneath to sort of wait around in.

436
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:17,800
Speaker 1: you know While you're waiting for the these top tier shows to sort of keep the spirit alive.

437
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,973
Speaker 1: The thing is will it keep going after space dandy?

438
00:31:20,993 --> 00:31:23,805
Speaker 1: space dandy is gonna come out in the u.s Before it's gonna come out in Japan.

439
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:25,110
Speaker 1: How crazy is that shit?

440
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:25,893
Speaker 0: Yep.

441
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:33,060
Speaker 0: Well that happened with big o2 I guess sure and the Trigun movie really only happened because of the international audience.

442
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:36,930
Speaker 0: But it's it's interesting right?

443
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:38,138
Speaker 1: Trigun movie never saw it.

444
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:41,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have it okay I've had it since it.

445
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:51,020
Speaker 0: when it came out I got a copy of it with translations immediately and I never felt the desire to watch it that much Even though I really like Trigun sure.

446
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,440
Speaker 0: But what's really you know, I the reason I thought of this and I was thinking about more and more like why this happening right?

447
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,480
Speaker 0: Now is that I have a lot of friends, you know We have people in the front crew and people we know really in anime.

448
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:08,564
Speaker 0: Like we all went to RIT which is like the anime epicenter and you know The biggest anime club.

449
00:32:08,604 --> 00:32:21,800
Speaker 0: like there's a lot of really big reasons why anime fandom had a huge sort of stronghold in Rochester, New York because of the RIT anime club and Most of the people I knew had weren't watching anime anymore who were a big part of that.

450
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:35,519
Speaker 0: They were as into anime as we were like that deep every weekend marathoning shows like Ava and Eska and all these things and they kind of just stopped watching and They didn't know Madoka existed or was good.

451
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:42,709
Speaker 0: This past weekend two good friends deeply into anime Never didn't even know the the deal with Madoka.

452
00:32:43,351 --> 00:32:44,034
Speaker 0: So we showed it to him.

453
00:32:44,054 --> 00:32:44,957
Speaker 0: They're like, oh fuck.

454
00:32:45,177 --> 00:32:48,099
Speaker 0: Oh, hey Maybe we should watch anime again.

455
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:53,240
Speaker 0: But the reason that they they they they didn't say oh where you want to watch Madoka like, oh, let's watch Madoka.

456
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,788
Speaker 0: I showed that to them the anime they brought up.

457
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,360
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, we're gonna start watching anime again was attack on Titan.

458
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:06,730
Speaker 0: Yep, so why your attack on Titan get such a wide appeal that Madoka did not Mmm, like.

459
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:07,499
Speaker 0: what's the difference?

460
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:11,572
Speaker 1: Just the way it looks right Madoka.

461
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:12,716
Speaker 1: I you just look at you.

462
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:13,459
Speaker 1: It's a magical girl.

463
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,284
Speaker 1: Sure You're not gonna watch that.

464
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:17,543
Speaker 0: I mean we ignored it until people we trusted said guys It's not what it looks like.

465
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:20,274
Speaker 0: lots of people said I mean my little pony guys.

466
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,077
Speaker 0: It's not what it looks like.

467
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:23,487
Speaker 1: Watch it Yeah, but now there's a lot.

468
00:33:23,507 --> 00:33:24,129
Speaker 0: kill is right.

469
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:29,311
Speaker 1: exactly what attack on Titan space dandy You don't need to tell someone it's not what it looks like.

470
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:30,355
Speaker 1: It is what it looks like.

471
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:31,480
Speaker 0: Exactly, right?

472
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,122
Speaker 0: Kill-by-kill.

473
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:34,249
Speaker 0: you watch the first five minutes of that.

474
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:37,379
Speaker 0: You're like this show is exactly what it professes to be.

475
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,444
Speaker 1: Yep It's like you don't you know?

476
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:42,152
Speaker 1: and you know people who aren't there's.

477
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:43,677
Speaker 1: there are people who like anime.

478
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:46,900
Speaker 1: they will watch it All right, they watch the big shows, right?

479
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,782
Speaker 1: They don't they're not gonna.

480
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:55,446
Speaker 1: they're not those crazed anime fans that actually like our anime is our primary geekery and they watch all The animes no matter what it's like.

481
00:33:55,487 --> 00:34:00,000
Speaker 1: they just like anime and they watch the big shows and we're sort of in that category.

482
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,023
Speaker 1: We're a little deeper than that.

483
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:06,824
Speaker 1: But most people I know, you know, anime is not their primary geekery, but they all like it They all know about it.

484
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:09,980
Speaker 1: They're fans of it and they watch the big items, right?

485
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,870
Speaker 1: And if there aren't any big items, they don't watch anything.

486
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:14,777
Speaker 1: and now there is actually.

487
00:34:14,797 --> 00:34:27,100
Speaker 1: you know It's like you don't want to start saying that like three to four items is suddenly a trend But sadly three to four is bigger and more than we've had in the past year or three.

488
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:37,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we've been watching a lot of anime lately and while we've watched all the big shows that were important that have come out Along I'm actually not paying for Netflix anymore, but I am paying for crunchy roll.

489
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:41,254
Speaker 0: Yeah, who would go back to Scott a year ago two years ago?

490
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,498
Speaker 0: That would not have been the case.

491
00:34:42,518 --> 00:34:47,311
Speaker 0: Hell no And I'm curious where this is going to go.

492
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:49,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's really all I got.

493
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:58,648
Speaker 0: I think it's worth paying attention to the fact that just recently and I think attack on Titan is the Primary academia Kickstarter.

494
00:34:58,929 --> 00:34:59,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

495
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of things happening, but I think attack on Titan is the cause.

496
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:10,209
Speaker 0: I think it is the spark that caused this interest even though there were better shows that came out Not that long before attack on Titan.

497
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:12,919
Speaker 0: attack on Titan had that full metal alchemist sort of.

498
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:14,145
Speaker 0: People don't like.

499
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:15,212
Speaker 0: they like the characters.

500
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:23,540
Speaker 0: the characters are iconic But the world building and the secretive space or what they're there for the cliffhangers They they gotta know what the fuck happened.

501
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:27,080
Speaker 0: So they get drawn in and they watch every episode just to know what happens next.

502
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:36,360
Speaker 1: I don't want to go overboard on it and be like anime is saved But I just want to say there's some rays of hope shining through and that I have not seen for a while.

503
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:38,643
Speaker 1: It has been a cloudy sky Right.

504
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:44,360
Speaker 1: Let us see if these rays continue to shine or if the clouds just cover that shit up in a year.

505
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:47,719
Speaker 0: But I think I can express why attack on Titan had the effect.

506
00:35:48,822 --> 00:35:49,644
Speaker 0: It's like I was saying.

507
00:35:49,684 --> 00:36:01,120
Speaker 0: it's got the cliffhangers the driving driving pace, but unlike other shows that have hooked people in before People care primarily about the world side of it and it's actually pretty accessible.

508
00:36:01,682 --> 00:36:06,215
Speaker 0: There's nothing too deep or difficult to figure out about what attack on Titan shows you.

509
00:36:06,235 --> 00:36:10,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no complex adolescence allegory going on.

510
00:36:11,022 --> 00:36:14,913
Speaker 0: So it's accessible but simultaneously at the end of every episode.

511
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:17,440
Speaker 0: All you're thinking about is what happens next.

512
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,685
Speaker 0: I gotta know what happens next.

513
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:21,860
Speaker 0: So it got people to not just watch it.

514
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:24,860
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of people would watch Madoka later and just watch the whole thing.

515
00:36:25,341 --> 00:36:30,937
Speaker 0: It got people to watch episode 5 and then wait until episode 6 and watch it immediately.

516
00:36:30,997 --> 00:36:34,007
Speaker 0: the day it came out watching it live mattered.

517
00:36:34,288 --> 00:36:40,960
Speaker 0: and the reason it mattered is because it had this critical mass of Anime fans and anime fans are mostly on the internet.

518
00:36:41,728 --> 00:36:45,186
Speaker 0: The whole spoiler Discussion culture is a big driver.

519
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:47,776
Speaker 0: people want to see the show as soon as possible.

520
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:56,089
Speaker 0: one to avoid spoilers But two more importantly the real reason to be involved in that conversation Every week of whoa.

521
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,219
Speaker 0: So what do you think's gonna happen to Levi now?

522
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:15,685
Speaker 0: And that's the thing that we used to get at RIT anime because we'd all watch these old shows together that now You don't get with anime fandom because you tell someone hey, you should watch Madoka I've already seen it a week later if they've watched all of it and then you talk about it But you never have that.

523
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:27,656
Speaker 0: it's very rare to have that moment where you and someone else are watching an anime that has a driving plot at the same time and have seen the same number of episodes and then Debate and discuss what's going to happen next.

524
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:32,460
Speaker 1: All right See the same thing going on as all those HBO shows that everyone watches.

525
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, Game of Thrones has the exact same thing going on.

526
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:36,079
Speaker 1: That I don't watch.

527
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:47,655
Speaker 0: So, uh, I hope you all continue to watch Kill La Kill and I hope if you haven't watched Attack on Titan you go watch it and Seriously, if you haven't watched Madoka Magica, no anime has come out since it.

528
00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:48,560
Speaker 0: that's better than it.

529
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:57,698
Speaker 1: Also, please come to our forum and suggest an old anime that we have not discussed on the show For us to discuss on the show.

530
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:05,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, if if you guys suggest something interesting or if enough of you suggest something bad, we'll watch it and we'll review it.

531
00:38:06,322 --> 00:38:07,648
Speaker 1: Don't say something stupid.

532
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:10,260
Speaker 0: Well, we've already reviewed Apocalypse Zero.

533
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,568
Speaker 1: Well, they might be like A Road to Godotula Blue Girl.

534
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:15,680
Speaker 0: I would not be opposed to reviewing those.

535
00:38:16,102 --> 00:38:18,760
Speaker 1: I haven't watched either one since forever.

536
00:38:20,861 --> 00:38:22,747
Speaker 0: So we'd have to watch them again, I guess.

537
00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:23,729
Speaker 1: Don't really want to do that.

538
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:29,167
Speaker 0: No, but I think it might be funny because as you recall I'm sure it'll make a great Geek Nights episode.

539
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:32,680
Speaker 1: It just won't make a great 90 minutes of my life spent watching either one.

540
00:38:38,472 --> 00:38:45,750
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott special Thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.
