1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,589
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Monday September 28th.

2
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:12,672
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,184
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight I cop out.

4
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:19,560
Speaker 0: we bring you the tech news round up.

5
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:33,261
Speaker 0: And we're back from her last convention for a while now.

7
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,188
Speaker 0: We can just kind of chill until what packs.

8
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:37,186
Speaker 0: well We got a. we got a move.

9
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,135
Speaker 0: I'm only talking about conventions.

10
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:43,425
Speaker 0: We don't have any big conventions that are in the next couple of weeks.

11
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:47,650
Speaker 1: There's actually this There's some stuff in the in the coming weeks.

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,419
Speaker 1: There's a yahoo hack day thing that I'm going to.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,145
Speaker 1: probably not you got I don't know.

14
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:53,989
Speaker 1: you got to sign up and get accepted Whatever.

15
00:00:55,132 --> 00:01:01,602
Speaker 1: There's also there's a GD GT They event that's gonna happen in the city on October 1st.

16
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,990
Speaker 1: I think it's 7 p.m Yeah, probably not going to that.

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,798
Speaker 1: I'm gonna check it out.

18
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:13,115
Speaker 1: cuz they got big-time Sponsors like like all sorts like Microsoft and Sony and like it's gonna be big booths and everything like a mini CES.

19
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:19,270
Speaker 0: almost it's on a Thursday night some tech thing Yep, and then I got stuff to do.

20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:27,254
Speaker 0: I'll check it, but I bring that up mostly because I know many new people are probably here after the New York anime festival, so We mentioned this.

21
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:31,630
Speaker 0: remember geek nights is four different shows and you're listening to the lint the neckbeard Linux show.

22
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:39,272
Speaker 0: No I would recommend coming back on Wednesday when we'll talk about the New York anime festival and anime manga comics all the stuff you probably Expect.

23
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:41,220
Speaker 1: I would not recommend coming back on Wednesday.

24
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:50,606
Speaker 1: if you're a New York anime festival person you Hopefully know about anime and you don't really need to listen to Wednesday Even though you probably will learn something on Wednesday because we probably know more than you.

25
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:55,898
Speaker 1: However odds are You don't know too much about technology.

26
00:01:55,938 --> 00:02:00,050
Speaker 1: if I know anime fans is actually surprising how few of them are technically knowledgeable.

27
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:10,202
Speaker 1: Therefore you should listen to the Monday shows and learn about the technology which affects every person who lives in The entire world regardless of your interest.

28
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,005
Speaker 0: just care about anime.

29
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:11,607
Speaker 0: come on Wednesday.

30
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:12,370
Speaker 0: We'll talk about anime.

31
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:13,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've been watching some anime.

32
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:15,302
Speaker 1: I haven't watched any anime.

33
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:17,882
Speaker 1: It's all video games and board games I've been watching.

34
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:23,806
Speaker 0: so of course I look everything got derailed when I started reading one of my trashy Temeraire novels.

35
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,110
Speaker 1: Why are you eating trash?

36
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,593
Speaker 0: It's good trash.

37
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:28,178
Speaker 1: I'm all reading erudite stuff.

38
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:28,720
Speaker 0: Yeah.

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,101
Speaker 0: Yeah.

40
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:29,482
Speaker 0: Mr.

41
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:31,067
Speaker 0: Has seen all of initial D.

42
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:31,890
Speaker 1: That's right.

43
00:02:32,212 --> 00:02:33,764
Speaker 1: I didn't say always.

44
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:39,259
Speaker 1: I said now So I didn't say for the.

45
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:40,650
Speaker 1: I didn't say forever either.

46
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:48,710
Speaker 0: Since we're doing the the periodic tech news Roundup we're not gonna do any news in the first half of the show because that would be kind of stupid.

47
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,746
Speaker 0: We what we do two news have a break and then just do a bunch more news.

48
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:52,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's no good.

49
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,177
Speaker 1: Plus we'll run out of news if we do that.

50
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,222
Speaker 0: I got plenty of news.

51
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:55,684
Speaker 1: All right.

52
00:02:55,825 --> 00:03:08,475
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah I got a a little rant, you know, what really grind Scott's gears why we got to use someone else's, you know It's like but this is the bull There's grinding gears.

53
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:09,299
Speaker 1: So what do we have?

54
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:10,624
Speaker 1: I don't know.

55
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:12,552
Speaker 0: you want to call it when you want something I don't know.

56
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:16,490
Speaker 1: It's a call it something but all the good ones are taken, you know, we can grant and whatever.

57
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:18,647
Speaker 1: so basically the thing you know, what's?

58
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:26,689
Speaker 1: I've noticed a lot of people lately as in the past year a few right they really really complain about.

59
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,116
Speaker 1: you know This application is a resource hog.

60
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:31,319
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not light.

61
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,904
Speaker 1: Oh, it's using too many.

62
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,127
Speaker 1: It's it's got using too much RAM.

63
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:38,585
Speaker 0: Yeah Right, I wouldn't say that's a recent phenomenon.

64
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:39,650
Speaker 1: Well, it doesn't matter.

65
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,350
Speaker 0: I've noticed it was even worse back in the day when it was a serious problem.

66
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:46,316
Speaker 0: I know if I open more than three IE browsers My computer would cry.

67
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:46,738
Speaker 0: and you have.

68
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:49,671
Speaker 1: you have approached the crux of my point here Right?

69
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,683
Speaker 1: is that I've noticed these complaints more and more frequently.

70
00:03:52,723 --> 00:04:00,269
Speaker 1: like people will use one program That is like less feature-rich over another because it's lighter or because they have this perception of it, right?

71
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:07,430
Speaker 1: That it seems lighter or they see it using less RAM on the RAM meter or it takes up less disk space.

72
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,248
Speaker 1: All right.

73
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:17,238
Speaker 1: First of all, if you have a computer that doesn't really have enough RAM to run modern application Just buy some more RAM buy some more goddamn RAM.

74
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,644
Speaker 0: It's like five dollars.

75
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:19,165
Speaker 0: boys this out.

76
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:23,756
Speaker 0: my computer, you know I made a badass computer Years ago.

77
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:25,588
Speaker 0: It's obviously not that badass anymore.

78
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:25,910
Speaker 0: You know what?

79
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:31,124
Speaker 0: I'm only using about 30% of my RAM and that includes the cache right now.

80
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:33,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got four gigs of RAM.

81
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,818
Speaker 0: I'm using almost none of it, right?

82
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:37,390
Speaker 0: I mean I see both my cores are practically idle.

83
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:42,910
Speaker 1: I mean think about it if you want and if anything right you want it to use more RAM, right?

84
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,335
Speaker 1: It's like you got four gigs of RAM Like I do.

85
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:48,774
Speaker 1: if only you're using two There's two going to waste.

86
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:52,145
Speaker 1: your computer could be using those other two to go even faster.

87
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,035
Speaker 1: and that's actually if using Linux Don't worry, you're all.

88
00:04:55,136 --> 00:05:01,596
Speaker 1: Linux automatically uses all your RAM as much as it possibly Aggressive disk cache.

89
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:03,967
Speaker 0: I'm just noting Windows does not even in Linux.

90
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:07,883
Speaker 0: right now I'm using less than 33% of my RAM including the cache.

91
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:09,028
Speaker 0: I just have so much RAM.

92
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:11,636
Speaker 1: I know Okay, so that's number one.

93
00:05:11,716 --> 00:05:12,899
Speaker 1: number two disk space.

94
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,584
Speaker 0: Oh, one of my cores is doing something now.

95
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:20,250
Speaker 1: drives are so So cheap you could get like terabytes for nothing.

96
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:27,180
Speaker 1: So if a program takes up like a hundred more megs than the competitor That is not a reason to pick one over the other.

97
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,490
Speaker 1: a hundred megs is so such a small amount of disk space.

98
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:31,759
Speaker 1: I don't even notice it.

99
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,270
Speaker 1: It's like effectively invisible.

100
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:42,282
Speaker 1: Number three it is true that some programs just faster than others I mean Chrome is just faster than Firefox.

101
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:43,125
Speaker 1: that I mean it.

102
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,330
Speaker 1: it just is right.

103
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:46,668
Speaker 1: It's you know, they're benchmarks to prove it.

104
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:50,124
Speaker 1: But don't go by just your perception.

105
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,115
Speaker 1: a lot of times you will perceive Something to be faster.

106
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:55,020
Speaker 1: they it feels faster they say.

107
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:57,006
Speaker 1: but then an actual benchmark shows.

108
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:58,370
Speaker 1: No, it's just your perception.

109
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:03,450
Speaker 1: Well, it's tricky because benchmark, you know, some UI element makes it seem lighter or seem faster.

110
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:04,314
Speaker 0: Well one.

111
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:13,410
Speaker 0: I would argue that unless you're doing large amounts of data processing Perception probably matters more than the benchmark, especially because most benchmarks are not terribly accurate to actual use cases.

112
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:18,136
Speaker 1: No, no, but you can actually have you know, like, you know, UI And benchmarks.

113
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:30,415
Speaker 0: as opposed to you know, a lot of benchmarks will just do like the render time or stuff like that If you've got an application that is measurably faster in the UI than another application and yet people perceive the other slower Application to be faster.

114
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:31,700
Speaker 0: You have done something wrong.

115
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:34,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, your application is doing something wrong.

116
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:35,533
Speaker 0: Yes, but that's important.

117
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:40,706
Speaker 0: especially, you know, we love open source software, but often not the best user interfaces.

118
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:41,668
Speaker 0: Yeah GIMP.

119
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:42,289
Speaker 0: I'm looking at you.

120
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:45,919
Speaker 0: Anyway, I used to think that GIMP was a good interface.

121
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,056
Speaker 0: then I watched someone who knew how to draw try to use the GIMP for more than five minutes.

122
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:53,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is, you know, anyway, we're not gonna get it.

123
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,216
Speaker 1: Do it go down that road.

124
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:55,322
Speaker 1: That's not the road.

125
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:55,986
Speaker 1: We're going down.

126
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:56,570
Speaker 0: That's Thursday.

127
00:06:56,971 --> 00:07:05,948
Speaker 1: My point is right is that when you you know, a lot of people, you know, it's okay to choose Chrome over Firefox Right, but it's because it's faster, which it is.

128
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:11,174
Speaker 1: Don't go telling me you're using Chrome over Firefox because it uses less RAM You're not you?

129
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:16,050
Speaker 1: unless you're using all of your RAM and you have no money to buy more right?

130
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:20,810
Speaker 1: That's the only person who has a valid complaint about how much RAM it's using, right?

131
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,329
Speaker 1: Maybe this is you know stability if you can measure, you know that.

132
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,490
Speaker 1: yes This is crashing more than that other one, you know, and you can tell that the crashing isn't your fault.

133
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:36,835
Speaker 0: Well one more which often is one possible but unlikely case is the low-power netbook That is true.

134
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:38,907
Speaker 0: But then again, you're using all your RAM and you can't get more.

135
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:39,389
Speaker 0: So there you go.

136
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:53,579
Speaker 1: So, you know a lot of people they're just they're like picking, you know Which after deciding which application to use based on like these completely irrational factors of you know Some perceived increased resource usage.

137
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:05,969
Speaker 0: Well at the same time, you know in my line of work This actually affects me To a great degree because one, you know, we a problem we will sometimes run into is that a trader, you know We're a stock kind of company.

138
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:14,370
Speaker 0: Well, you install our application and complain that it's too much of a load on their system But we know how much load our application puts on someone's system and it's basically nothing.

139
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:22,650
Speaker 1: Yeah it uses basically Gooey with a few buttons like effectively the same as like a visual basic app with some network data traffic.

140
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:24,370
Speaker 0: It's a more complicated than that.

141
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:30,670
Speaker 0: We have different things but regardless the actual reason for that as I've discovered is that in the stock world?

142
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:37,869
Speaker 0: there's something called an OMS an order management system and that is what like The big bad trader at a company like manages all the or it's like the Bloomberg machine.

143
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:39,717
Speaker 0: Nah, Bloomberg machine is something different.

144
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,830
Speaker 0: Okay, but an OMS would be like McGregor Charles River.

145
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:45,912
Speaker 1: So this is like it's basically a screen full of numbers I'm guessing.

146
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:54,787
Speaker 0: basically an OMS is the thing where like the head trader of a company will put in like I Want my company to buy 10 million of this 10 million of that 100 million of that 40 million of that.

147
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:58,572
Speaker 0: I only want to pay this much for that as much, you know All that stuff.

148
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:07,147
Speaker 0: and then they allocate chunks of all this stuff to all their traders and then the traders Go and get it done in their little OMS is get these tickets of.

149
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:08,495
Speaker 0: you know Get this done.

150
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:10,770
Speaker 0: and then they use their discretion of duties.

151
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:20,810
Speaker 0: Let me tell you are these things, you know The words resource intensive never meant much to me even in all the data processing that processing and audio and video have done in my life.

152
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:33,410
Speaker 0: Until I loaded one of these bastards on my computer at work four gigs of RAM quad-core Brought to its knees for like two minutes while one of these things loads up And it was using all the resources.

153
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:40,970
Speaker 1: See now that is a valid complaint right there, you know, but like, you know, I watch some of these stock traders.

154
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:50,188
Speaker 0: They'll have like five monitors and like this quad-core like eight gigabyte 64-bit monster of a machine And they're still complaining about how slow it is.

155
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:58,425
Speaker 1: I mean that that that tells me the application just poorly written because there's no reason that a program that just you know Does stock stuff should take up that much resource.

156
00:09:58,486 --> 00:09:59,310
Speaker 0: Well, you'd be surprised.

157
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,849
Speaker 0: I mean think about the logistics of for example, say you have an application right?

158
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,376
Speaker 0: Consuming market data.

159
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,924
Speaker 0: It's not just you know, what do you I mean?

160
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:08,110
Speaker 0: What do you think stock prices are?

161
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,633
Speaker 0: It's not like.

162
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:09,800
Speaker 0: there's just like this.

163
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,249
Speaker 0: is the price now this?

164
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:12,115
Speaker 1: yeah But that's see.

165
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:14,190
Speaker 1: what I'm saying is that it's a poor architecture, right?

166
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:23,047
Speaker 1: If you need like market data consumed and you have a trading company or like, you know Whatever, you should have some sort of centralized powerhouse machine that's doing that.

167
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:23,850
Speaker 0: So it consumes it.

168
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,338
Speaker 0: How do I get it from there to me?

169
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:32,883
Speaker 1: and then the machine that you're sitting at is only getting the data it needs From your big nasty server in the closet.

170
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,124
Speaker 1: Yeah.

171
00:10:33,144 --> 00:10:34,469
Speaker 0: So what data do I need there?

172
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,865
Speaker 0: There are multiple levels of the order book for at any second.

173
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,853
Speaker 0: the market data Problem.

174
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:40,756
Speaker 1: it sounds to me like.

175
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:44,730
Speaker 1: the problem though is the desktop is doing all the work and getting the data feed right into it.

176
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:47,330
Speaker 0: That's not really the problem.

177
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:54,358
Speaker 0: The problem is that even if you have big bad machines to get it and parse it there's still just so much data Mm-hmm, and you also you have to deal with it.

178
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:57,129
Speaker 0: What if you're trying to route out to like algos or something like that?

179
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,610
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is but no the architecture.

180
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:03,342
Speaker 0: But it's not crap for the reasons you'd expect.

181
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:10,304
Speaker 1: when you're deciding, you know When you're choosing between various applications like you're choosing your browser, you're choosing your media player.

182
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:11,568
Speaker 1: You're choosing your whatever, right?

183
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,461
Speaker 1: base your decisions upon Rational factors and not things like.

184
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:20,468
Speaker 1: it uses 10 more megs of RAM.

185
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,286
Speaker 1: Oh, no That means it's worse because usually it's using those 10 megs of RAM for like some feature.

186
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:26,110
Speaker 1: That's probably worth it.

187
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:33,250
Speaker 0: Well, if you fall down that trap I mean I remember when the screen on my laptop just stopped working one day and I actually got it repaired for free under the warranty.

188
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:33,874
Speaker 0: I was shocked.

189
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:38,430
Speaker 0: I expected to have to pay like a thousand dollars to fix that Yep, and I got it all fixed.

190
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:45,602
Speaker 0: But the tech who fixed it like he got it all done and first he pretended that it was gonna cost me like 900 bucks and then after I was like god damn it.

191
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:46,165
Speaker 0: I went to pay.

192
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:51,030
Speaker 0: he's like nah, I just fucking with you Yeah, but then he was like, you know now he was obviously a bait-and-swing.

193
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,481
Speaker 0: He pulls the RAM out of my laptop.

194
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:58,078
Speaker 0: My laptop has two gigs of RAM on one stick Mm-hmm, and he's like you got three slots here.

195
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:03,664
Speaker 0: feel how hot that RAM is because you only have one stick if you buy Two more two gig sticks.

196
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:04,450
Speaker 0: It'll even it out.

197
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,639
Speaker 0: And I was like, yeah, thanks for fixing my laptop.

198
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,248
Speaker 0: Give me my computer back with that Ram back in there.

199
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:13,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ram is hot we know.

200
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:18,390
Speaker 0: plus I'm like you realize how long it'll take for me to hibernate my computer with six gigs of RAM.

201
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:24,663
Speaker 0: Yeah So true, yeah, so I you know, I have an opposite rant.

202
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,410
Speaker 0: I have the exact opposite of a rant.

203
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:34,762
Speaker 0: You see I led a very privileged life and until after I had graduated high school I never in my life held a job.

204
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:47,030
Speaker 0: the closest thing to a job I ever had was like marching band in high school or I remember I used to charge local kids 15 bucks a half hour for Trumpet lessons and but I never had an actual job and I left Kyle.

205
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,693
Speaker 0: I left all right.

206
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:48,195
Speaker 0: God.

207
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:48,999
Speaker 0: I keep thinking like college.

208
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:49,742
Speaker 0: I left high school.

209
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:51,450
Speaker 0: I had that summer of nothing.

210
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:54,489
Speaker 0: So I decided I should get a job and get some money.

211
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:58,831
Speaker 0: So I applied to work for the US Census the census 2000.

212
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:05,718
Speaker 0: I was a payroll clerk and HR clerk and I did a bunch of other crazy stuff for the census for that whole summer and Let me tell you to this day.

213
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:07,993
Speaker 0: It was one of the most fun jobs I ever had like.

214
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,750
Speaker 0: working for the US Census was so unlike what I expected.

215
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:18,229
Speaker 0: Pretty much everyone working there was cool because for the most part These were people who didn't need to work who wanted to work for fun.

216
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:25,332
Speaker 0: They were like housewives who were like I'll get out of the house and work for the census and do a good thing and save the world and said to stop It's all cool.

217
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:30,188
Speaker 0: And I was thinking about it and I'm not really in a position to work for the 2010 census.

218
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:36,324
Speaker 0: I haven't even though I still have a letter of recommendation from like the regional director of the part of the census I worked for him.

219
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:43,558
Speaker 0: They basically decided I was a badass and they were like if you want to work for the census in 2010 You can like run a regional office.

220
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,767
Speaker 1: No, I wonder how much that pays.

221
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:46,470
Speaker 0: not that much.

222
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,929
Speaker 0: Do you leave absence to do that as much as I would like to?

223
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,101
Speaker 0: They're not going to pay me even a fraction of what I make in my stock market stuff.

224
00:13:54,462 --> 00:13:56,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you would count things.

225
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but one thing I can say.

226
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,157
Speaker 1: you thought you could send guys out and say listen There's five crab people living in Hudson Valley.

227
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:05,759
Speaker 1: I was paid.

228
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,865
Speaker 0: I worked 40 hours a week for that summer.

229
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:10,593
Speaker 0: I was paid $11.35 an hour.

230
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:17,636
Speaker 0: That's pretty good in for the year 2000 in Year $2,000.

231
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:20,052
Speaker 0: That was a lot of money Yeah I mean.

232
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:27,884
Speaker 0: and the thing is I think back and I remember when I got my first paycheck and it was like 400 bucks and I'm looking at this and I realized how much money this was.

233
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:29,329
Speaker 0: It was all mine video games.

234
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:32,049
Speaker 0: That's why I came to RIT.

235
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:40,826
Speaker 1: That's why I got a job in high school as soon as I was legally able to and that is why I was able to buy computers and video games and all sorts of other stuff.

236
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,630
Speaker 1: It's got privileged life.

237
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,123
Speaker 1: My parents bought me all that stuff and that's why I am very glad I did not.

238
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:48,637
Speaker 1: I was done playing Magic the Gathering by The time I was able to get a job.

239
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:50,303
Speaker 0: Magic cards were just like swords.

240
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:51,910
Speaker 0: It's a damn fucking good thing.

241
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,004
Speaker 0: You never had money when you wanted Magic cards.

242
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:58,690
Speaker 1: When I got a job I was tired of Magic the Gathering and I was tired of all stupid crap like that.

243
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,930
Speaker 1: And all I wanted was computers and video games.

244
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:03,758
Speaker 0: I used that money for one thing.

245
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,062
Speaker 0: that job is why when I went to RIT I showed up with a $4,000 computer.

246
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:13,570
Speaker 0: I mean, I had the baddest as computer in the world when I got to RIT.

247
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,950
Speaker 1: It's also the first thing I did when I had my job, you know in high school working at the dry-cleaner.

248
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,716
Speaker 0: See, that's another benefit.

249
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:22,838
Speaker 1: I saved up and bought a Pentium 3 450 megahertz.

250
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,930
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

251
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:28,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember I bought like an AMD like 900 megahertz with that thing.

252
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:33,309
Speaker 1: It lasted a long time until I replaced it with that AMD and then I replaced the AMD with what I have.

253
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,344
Speaker 0: now I'm only on my third desktop in my whole life.

254
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:36,807
Speaker 0: Third.

255
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:39,924
Speaker 1: God, let's see I had the 486 but that really wasn't.

256
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:41,050
Speaker 1: that was a family computer.

257
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:46,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, my first computer that I bought was that AMD 900 and then I bought the computer I'm using now.

258
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:48,014
Speaker 1: You're only on number two.

259
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:52,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, well in between remember my motherboard blew up, but that was an incremental upgrade.

260
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, I went up to a Thunderbird.

261
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:58,809
Speaker 1: I've had plenty of upgrades adding drives and all that, you know RAM and who knows what.

262
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:01,678
Speaker 0: so Yep, yep, but what point of advice?

263
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:04,207
Speaker 0: the first for all you nerds out there and all you punk kids.

264
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:05,170
Speaker 0: you want some money.

265
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:07,016
Speaker 0: Work for the census.

266
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:11,090
Speaker 0: they pay real well, and you basically don't have to do any work at all.

267
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:12,674
Speaker 0: It's just super fun.

268
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:23,208
Speaker 0: Everyone's cool and they need tech people and the test you take to work for the census Basically amounts to can you breathe and can you add two two-digit numbers to each other?

269
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:26,365
Speaker 0: Hmm You would be surprised how many people fail this test.

270
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:33,270
Speaker 0: Yep Well, or you might not be depending on you know, yeah that was that was one of the first points when rim became very cynical.

271
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:36,469
Speaker 1: So, you know rim was talking about the census and I was like man.

272
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:39,639
Speaker 1: Census needs to get more technologies going on.

273
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott's like where's the fucking API for this?

274
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:43,450
Speaker 0: probably like some busted old database.

275
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:44,616
Speaker 0: He's really down on it.

276
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,149
Speaker 0: So we go to the census website, you know census gov.

277
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,918
Speaker 0: There's just API's open source tools.

278
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:50,943
Speaker 0: You can get it all the data.

279
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:51,505
Speaker 0: You can download.

280
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:58,248
Speaker 1: there is a public domain Software package for the census and I'm like, oh shit I am all over this action.

281
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:04,277
Speaker 1: But you know people always braille all these all these open source guys like probably don't even know about this Like everyone's ignoring it.

282
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,128
Speaker 1: I'm so gonna rock the house.

283
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,569
Speaker 0: I mean since this API the US government is generally very behind the times very crap when it comes to technology.

284
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:21,617
Speaker 0: But there are tiny pieces of it that are very very well run and it the census of the United States is One of the coolest things our government does.

285
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:31,470
Speaker 0: and it amazes me the amount of wargling and bullshit that the Republican Party basically is pulling out of the woodwork this year and I think I know why this is more Thursday.

286
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:37,102
Speaker 0: But I want to point out to everyone out there The right-wing and the Republicans are basically getting to the point where they may.

287
00:17:37,163 --> 00:17:44,050
Speaker 0: a lot of people may boycott the census or fight against It even though the census is one of the few things that's actually directly in the Constitution.

288
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:48,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says right in the Constitution not even in a law or anything else.

289
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:55,026
Speaker 1: in the Constitution It says there shall be a census every ten years now to count the people with.

290
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,290
Speaker 1: those aren't the exact words.

291
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,090
Speaker 1: The gray has the word sense.

292
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:09,189
Speaker 0: The greatest part about all this is that one part of the reason I think the right-wing is scared Is that in America there has been a huge shift in population toward, you know liberal places and cities and things.

293
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:14,123
Speaker 0: and Also, there's been a big shift away from a lot of places where Republicans had majorities.

294
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,439
Speaker 0: and one thing the census does for people They don't live in the United States.

295
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:26,050
Speaker 0: Is that every time we do it That determines how many you know seats in the House of Representatives different states get how many votes they get in the Electoral College.

296
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:36,930
Speaker 0: There's a good chance that all the so-called blue states are gonna get a bunch of seats and votes And all the so-called red states are gonna lose a bunch of seats and votes and they don't want that to happen.

297
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:47,315
Speaker 0: However by boycotting the census the people who are losing the votes are basically saying don't count me Don't count me.

298
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,365
Speaker 1: Do not find one less representative for you.

299
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,950
Speaker 0: I can imagine the census 2010.

300
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,123
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, there are only eight people living in Kentucky.

301
00:18:55,143 --> 00:19:00,336
Speaker 0: Well, they only get one seat this year But we got two senators.

302
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:04,550
Speaker 0: though if you're a punk kid and you have free time you need a job work for the census.

303
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:05,277
Speaker 0: It's badass.

304
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,714
Speaker 0: I still have my badge Not on purpose.

305
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:10,568
Speaker 0: I actually lost it and got another one because you have to give the badge back.

306
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,097
Speaker 0: Obviously It's like the scary-looking federal government badge.

307
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:13,538
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

308
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:16,990
Speaker 0: And then I found like three or four years ago the one I'd lost.

309
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:18,829
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, so I've got it.

310
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:22,870
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna scan it in or show it to anyone because I shouldn't have it but it's really cool.

311
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:24,306
Speaker 0: Got a federal seal on it.

312
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:27,430
Speaker 0: If I ever really need to scam someone that thing will so come in handy.

313
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:36,888
Speaker 1: You could go and pretend to be a census worker right now and then someone like it visited twice And then I'll probably get visited by the FBI Probably.

314
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:47,350
Speaker 0: But if you're a nerd and you don't have time to work for the census Go check out all their open-source API data sets and do something cool like a mashup with Google Maps or something Google charts.

315
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:48,267
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

316
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:56,613
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

317
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:57,820
Speaker 0: before we get into the things of the day.

318
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,600
Speaker 0: We were at a pretty cool gizmodo thing in the city over the weekend.

319
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:15,939
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah gizmodo the website had this gizmodo gallery sort of a temporary mini museum Downtown in New York City, so, you know, we were in town for the New York Anime Festival on Saturday and we're like Hey, let's go down and check this gizmodo gallery while it's there.

320
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:19,474
Speaker 1: So we go down and check it out and it was well worth our time.

321
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:20,217
Speaker 0: the coolest thing.

322
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:21,020
Speaker 0: We're walking tomorrow day.

323
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,764
Speaker 0: We weren't like.

324
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:24,480
Speaker 0: we knew pretty much where it was, but we didn't know like exactly.

325
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,120
Speaker 0: So we're walking down the street and we see a crowd outside a building.

326
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,987
Speaker 1: We're like that must be it.

327
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:35,500
Speaker 0: and as we walk up in the distance We hear music and the first thing I think is that sounds a lot like Tesla coils and we get there.

328
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,379
Speaker 0: There's a Tesla coil concert going on.

329
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:43,964
Speaker 0: yeah, and the funny thing is you know, we just Emily and Alex had come with us to PAX and as we're walking up we See this crowd Emily's like.

330
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:48,500
Speaker 0: that looks a lot like the crowd from PAX and I'm like, that's probably the gizmodo crowd.

331
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,139
Speaker 0: It's mostly the same kind of crowd.

332
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:55,160
Speaker 0: Yep All these hipster looking people wearing black and geeky t-shirts and being all hip.

333
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,955
Speaker 0: Everyone has like all their smartphones out taking pictures of the Tesla coils.

334
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:00,320
Speaker 1: That's the PAX crowd.

335
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:01,806
Speaker 0: There was some really cool stuff there.

336
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,080
Speaker 0: I the mud computer the the first Walkman.

337
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:11,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first Walkman ever one of the first VCRs ever like this engineering model from JVC.

338
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:13,485
Speaker 1: All sorts of crazy.

339
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:17,100
Speaker 0: I gotta say the first Walkman was surprisingly impressive.

340
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:19,932
Speaker 0: It was awesome primarily because you look at it and you're like you.

341
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,760
Speaker 0: think about the Walkman like when we got him.

342
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,799
Speaker 1: It was one of the better Walkman though Some of the later ones were cheap and crappy.

343
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:27,690
Speaker 1: Sitting with Discman like I had this awesome old Discman.

344
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:30,760
Speaker 1: but over time the Discman they just made him shittier and shittier.

345
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:31,669
Speaker 1: They didn't make them better.

346
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:41,131
Speaker 0: the original Walkman When the further revolution of the world when people were like carry music with you is So small and well engineered that today.

347
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,780
Speaker 0: I would not feel that bad carrying something that lot size around.

348
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,729
Speaker 1: It's made of metal.

349
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:45,800
Speaker 1: serious business.

350
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:52,499
Speaker 1: The original iPod has an actual wheel that actually spins, you know, the first Walkman's and even continuing.

351
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:57,780
Speaker 0: in Japan They just by default had two ports for headphones in case you wanted to share music with a friend.

352
00:21:58,182 --> 00:21:59,629
Speaker 0: Where the fuck is that on my iPod?

353
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:00,231
Speaker 1: That's right.

354
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,960
Speaker 0: I got to use some crap splitter.

355
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:10,030
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean it would take up some room in that incredibly small iPod, but even so I mean, you know It doesn't have that much room.

356
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,796
Speaker 1: It's totally worth it.

357
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,926
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, it was cool.

358
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:13,772
Speaker 0: I don't know what else I can say.

359
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:14,960
Speaker 0: We'll link to like a gallery.

360
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,427
Speaker 0: I mean, I didn't take any pictures.

361
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:18,980
Speaker 0: There were so many people with smartphones taking pictures.

362
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,167
Speaker 1: Yeah, one cool thing they had was a little stand where you could try out all the best of each Smartphone one for each operating system.

363
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:27,191
Speaker 1: So there's six smartphones.

364
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,720
Speaker 0: I love techie people, you know anime cons, whatever.

365
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:37,300
Speaker 0: But at this kind, you know at this little gallery event I stood there and debated with like four people the merits of all the phones for like ten minutes and everyone was smart.

366
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:39,347
Speaker 1: They had a 3d Etch A Sketch.

367
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:41,736
Speaker 0: They had a 3d Etch A Sketch were surprisingly cool.

368
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:42,860
Speaker 1: They had a machine that made pancakes.

369
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,605
Speaker 0: They had a fancy In the back in the back.

370
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:47,569
Speaker 1: They were just playing.

371
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,556
Speaker 1: they're playing rock bad Beatles rock band.

372
00:22:49,596 --> 00:22:50,520
Speaker 1: and I was like, why is it?

373
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,965
Speaker 1: What is special about this?

374
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:53,572
Speaker 1: Why are they just playing Beatles rock band?

375
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:54,296
Speaker 1: who gives a crap?

376
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:58,912
Speaker 1: and then I'm like The TV is like a hundred inches plus.

377
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:01,040
Speaker 0: it was like this gigantic plasma screen.

378
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,169
Speaker 0: It was one of those beautiful things I've ever seen in my life.

379
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:05,640
Speaker 1: It's like the biggest fucking television in the universe.

380
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,644
Speaker 1: I was like, holy shit.

381
00:23:06,744 --> 00:23:08,912
Speaker 1: I didn't like you don't realize it cuz just like a TV.

382
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:14,860
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, it's a TV Yep, and right next to them was the dude playing the laser guitar.

383
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:18,471
Speaker 1: There's a guitar that you play it by this for laser beams and you break them.

384
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:23,311
Speaker 0: actually way back when I was making a DDR pad I Sketched out everything I would need.

385
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:24,560
Speaker 0: I didn't build it cuz I didn't have the money.

386
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:27,193
Speaker 0: But remember I made that shitty as DDR pad.

387
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:28,037
Speaker 0: I eventually got rid of yep.

388
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:36,904
Speaker 0: well I had this idea make a laser DDR pad a DDR pad where the arrows were all recessed and just put lasers and you know Mirrors and sensors.

389
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:37,567
Speaker 1: go for it.

390
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:39,093
Speaker 0: And now I have the money.

391
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:39,957
Speaker 0: I might just do it.

392
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:40,740
Speaker 1: go for it.

393
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,623
Speaker 1: It'd be totally awesome.

394
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:42,507
Speaker 0: What do you mean that hard to do?

395
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:43,310
Speaker 0: I mean that DDR pad.

396
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:50,569
Speaker 0: I was not that Technologically or Carpentarily proficient back then, you know you could do.

397
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:53,360
Speaker 1: actually you can make the DDR pad like nice and like, you know.

398
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,500
Speaker 1: Instead of being metal you could make it like a nice like a just like like a dance floor surface.

399
00:23:58,002 --> 00:23:59,949
Speaker 1: If you did that it has to move.

400
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:01,394
Speaker 0: it would have to be recessed though.

401
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:04,460
Speaker 0: where all the things are It's just slightly so though.

402
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:11,200
Speaker 0: The other problem is that there's one Dancing technique you can't do which is where you leave your foot down and just like lift up the pressure and put go back down.

403
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:15,860
Speaker 1: You could you just plan to put the laser real low now because you have to still lift your foot?

404
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,362
Speaker 0: I would not.

405
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:17,970
Speaker 0: I would often when I play DDR.

406
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,059
Speaker 0: My foot does not actually leave the pad.

407
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:22,566
Speaker 0: Mmm, it would be cool though.

408
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,293
Speaker 0: It's something maybe I'm doing.

409
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:24,755
Speaker 0: I don't know.

410
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:25,980
Speaker 0: I just thought it was cool.

411
00:24:26,322 --> 00:24:27,449
Speaker 0: I have an actual thing of the day.

412
00:24:28,012 --> 00:24:28,978
Speaker 0: So number way back.

413
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,090
Speaker 0: I don't know how impressed Scott will be by this but I was there.

414
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,120
Speaker 0: I had that that Martin Luther King auto-tune.

415
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,320
Speaker 0: That was actually I thought pretty good and pretty inspiring.

416
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:41,048
Speaker 0: All right, I thought it was pretty cool.

417
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:44,559
Speaker 0: it made me I don't know very hopeful very very happy was a cool thing.

418
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:47,831
Speaker 0: and You know suddenly people were making a ton of these things.

419
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:52,895
Speaker 1: auto-tune is like the new hotness What exact like where all these people getting the auto-tune from?

420
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:53,598
Speaker 0: you just buy it.

421
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:56,534
Speaker 1: It's software Yeah, but I mean people obviously are not paying for it.

422
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:58,343
Speaker 0: Uh Maybe I don't know.

423
00:24:58,403 --> 00:24:59,869
Speaker 0: I didn't check the Pirate Bay.

424
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,499
Speaker 1: I see like what is the name of the program auto-tune?

425
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:02,860
Speaker 1: Really?

426
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just it.

427
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,032
Speaker 0: Okay, I could talk We just not get into it.

428
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,740
Speaker 0: I could talk forever.

429
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:10,875
Speaker 0: We will do a Monday show cuz we haven't done anything like this a while.

430
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:11,800
Speaker 0: and on auto-tune?

431
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:14,472
Speaker 0: Well, no on vocoders and auto-tune and all that stuff.

432
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:15,015
Speaker 1: Okay.

433
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,522
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about that I do.

434
00:25:17,104 --> 00:25:22,266
Speaker 0: I thought of that because Scott was trying to get me to do a show on DRBD and all this like cool Like shared file system stuff.

435
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:23,070
Speaker 0: I don't know.

436
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,240
Speaker 0: I want to know about yeah, and I'll do a show on it.

437
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,160
Speaker 0: But I haven't been working on that stuff lately.

438
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,991
Speaker 0: I've been writing bullshit Java code instead.

439
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,259
Speaker 0: so I gotta go look at my configs.

440
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,753
Speaker 0: But that aside someone put together an auto-tune.

441
00:25:34,773 --> 00:25:41,659
Speaker 0: that is basically a tribute to Carl Sagan who is One of the few people that I would really honestly consider a hero in this world.

442
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:46,744
Speaker 0: Carl Sagan is just the man to a degree that you know None of you will ever.

443
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:50,780
Speaker 1: none of us will ever obtain the same guy did both of these or a different guy?

444
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:51,924
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

445
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:56,600
Speaker 0: I did no research out what that so ever but I watched this like four times and was deeply inspired.

446
00:25:57,283 --> 00:26:01,060
Speaker 0: The sky calls to us if we do not destroy ourselves we will one day venture to the stars.

447
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:05,935
Speaker 0: I'll still more glory as dawn awaits not a sunrise but a galaxy unless you already missed our chance.

448
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:15,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll do a hypothesis But seriously Carl Sagan for a whole generation of people before Scott and I and all of us.

449
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:32,820
Speaker 0: You know our generation a whole generation of people became scientists And if you ask them it is pretty much straight up because they watched Carl Sagan's cosmos or they read Carl Sagan's cosmos and We need more people to watch and read Carl Sagan's cosmos and be interested in science.

450
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:34,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, not enough science going on.

451
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:35,257
Speaker 0: seriously.

452
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:35,700
Speaker 0: watch this.

453
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,060
Speaker 1: It is very inspiring and even people who are smart enough to listen to geek nights are not understanding the science so much.

454
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:45,973
Speaker 1: That's all I've got all right, so this isn't a big thing of the day.

455
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:47,639
Speaker 1: It's just sort of you know little thing.

456
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,756
Speaker 1: Basically, you know that the new browsers with the HTML 5 they're all gonna have the canvas element.

457
00:26:53,796 --> 00:27:02,151
Speaker 1: some of them already have the canvas Element but not all of them, but eventually they all will and the canvas element basically says hey web browser Make a square and inside that square.

458
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:04,823
Speaker 1: I'm gonna draw shit, and I'm gonna draw whatever the hell I want now.

459
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:05,545
Speaker 0: is that not?

460
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:09,879
Speaker 0: the web developers dream the pixel placement on the screen right.

461
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,843
Speaker 0: well It's not almost rhymed I'm mostly.

462
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,913
Speaker 1: what it is is something they compete with flash right.

463
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:17,973
Speaker 1: so you can make a game in there Or you can make you know some sort of animation in there.

464
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:18,898
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

465
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:22,840
Speaker 1: The thing is this you can't really do 3d in there easily.

466
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:24,754
Speaker 0: You can do it in that GIMP way.

467
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, some people have done like Wolfenstein 3d in there.

468
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:34,179
Speaker 1: You know which is sort of - you know you use 2d to make 3d But basically you're gonna have to write all the 3d code on your own.

469
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:36,111
Speaker 1: You know cuz it's it's you.

470
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:40,140
Speaker 0: all you have are the 2d drawing tool And you don't want to do that for anything other than an exercise.

471
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:41,524
Speaker 0: I mean seriously.

472
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:47,600
Speaker 1: so now in the latest Firefox nightly build right they have web GL.

473
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:49,940
Speaker 1: So you can do OpenGL in the canvas.

474
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:55,780
Speaker 1: 3d in the browser no plugins no nothing just a box.

475
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,028
Speaker 1: And then you do 3d in it and they had the demo.

476
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:09,189
Speaker 1: it has the spar like a spore creature rendered inside one of these canvas boxes, so Yeah, all those things that like add 3d to the browser.

477
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:13,482
Speaker 1: You know like you know quake live and such not gonna need that in The future.

478
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:15,975
Speaker 1: we're just gonna you know 3d game right in the browser.

479
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:16,578
Speaker 1: No flash.

480
00:28:16,658 --> 00:28:17,060
Speaker 1: No nothing.

481
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:18,487
Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to it.

482
00:28:18,688 --> 00:28:20,658
Speaker 1: probably a couple years out everyone will have it.

483
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:27,140
Speaker 0: So without further ado it's time for the totally cop-out tech news round.

484
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:36,590
Speaker 0: Oh, I feel like I should play some roundup music or something like you know like Like Western roundup, I think so all right.

485
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:37,032
Speaker 1: That's all.

486
00:28:37,072 --> 00:28:37,895
Speaker 1: you go find some.

487
00:28:37,955 --> 00:28:39,300
Speaker 0: that's not happening, okay?

488
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:41,065
Speaker 1: You want to start?

489
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,727
Speaker 1: you got a tech news or you want me to go for tech news real quick I want to talk about.

490
00:28:44,828 --> 00:28:47,324
Speaker 0: you know this is slightly old news But I have something.

491
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,573
Speaker 0: but remember news whatever.

492
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:54,500
Speaker 0: we're more about commentary here on geek nights But stack overflow which people have been saying they should do this forever.

493
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:58,740
Speaker 1: I want to make up first of all that people know there is a website called stack overflow.

494
00:28:59,261 --> 00:29:03,252
Speaker 1: The website is basically you might know a website called experts exchange.

495
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,160
Speaker 0: right I believe you mean experts exchange exactly.

496
00:29:06,482 --> 00:29:10,305
Speaker 1: It's a website where basically tech people ask questions And then they answer.

497
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:11,972
Speaker 1: other tech people answer the question.

498
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:15,317
Speaker 1: so if you need tech help you go there And you ask or you answer.

499
00:29:15,438 --> 00:29:18,794
Speaker 1: and The thing is the site requires money to get into.

500
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:20,020
Speaker 1: it's not a free site.

501
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:25,531
Speaker 1: So basically the obvious idea was hey Why doesn't someone just make a free experts exchange?

502
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,347
Speaker 1: and while someone did it's called stack overflow And it's way better.

503
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:34,933
Speaker 1: in addition to being free They also made two other sites server fault calm and super user calm.

504
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:45,743
Speaker 1: stack overflow is really just for programming questions Server fall is for IT questions and super user is for all the other sorts of computer questions that are not for stack overflow Or server fault.

505
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:46,707
Speaker 0: so they did.

506
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:54,151
Speaker 0: what everyone's been clamoring for them to do forever is now They have made something that is basically stack overflow for everything.

507
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,455
Speaker 0: stack exchange right.

508
00:29:55,495 --> 00:30:02,560
Speaker 1: so the way stack exchange is basically Hey, you punk kid whoever you are do you want to make your own question and answer site?

509
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,524
Speaker 1: Maybe for gaming?

510
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:11,160
Speaker 1: maybe for board games maybe for anime Maybe for bottle railroads, maybe for carpentry.

511
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,435
Speaker 1: You give us money And we will let you make a website.

512
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:20,234
Speaker 1: that is the same Software and stack overflow only for whatever your topic happens to be.

513
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:26,940
Speaker 0: so I'm going to say straight up This is a terrible idea that is going to fail miserably and be a footnote in internet history at best.

514
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:28,263
Speaker 1: Yeah I think that you know.

515
00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:37,755
Speaker 0: if this is going to collapse this for the same reason that dig and reddit and Basically everything else that is for a lot side wiki which failed before we even started.

516
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:38,677
Speaker 1: we're gonna talk about that.

517
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:39,420
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

518
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:41,591
Speaker 1: So yeah, I agree with you.

519
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:42,840
Speaker 1: That is not a good idea.

520
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,540
Speaker 1: And the reason what you know one guy I was listening to stack is the reason why is such a depressing reason?

521
00:30:48,202 --> 00:30:51,716
Speaker 1: Well, I was listening to the stack overflow podcast right and basically you know.

522
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:57,518
Speaker 1: you got Jeff Atwood Who's the guy who made the stack overflow with some other people and you got Joel Spolsky who sort of a?

523
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,407
Speaker 1: Infamous character in the software development world.

524
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,800
Speaker 1: right and the Joel Spolsky is the guy who's running the business part of you know.

525
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,770
Speaker 1: But the stack exchange where is the Jeff that would?

526
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:12,345
Speaker 1: he's just doing the stack overflow and basically It's like you know.

527
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:21,399
Speaker 1: Jeff wanted to open-source stack overflow eventually not now but eventually and Joel was like no you can never do it then my stack exchange won't make any money ever.

528
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:33,380
Speaker 1: and I think that basically they're a fool for trying the stack exchange model because number one they're charging way too much money Right and no one who pays that much money for one of these sites is gonna make that much money back.

529
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:38,876
Speaker 1: Right I mean no stack overflow site is ever gonna be as big as the original stack overflow.

530
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:48,880
Speaker 1: and two Right they should have just open-sourced it and made money the WordPress way whereas WordPress is making a lot more money than stack overflow is gonna make with the stack exchange.

531
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:52,739
Speaker 0: Well the two reasons why I believe it's just going to fail outright is that one?

532
00:31:53,602 --> 00:31:59,680
Speaker 0: Dig only worked sadly when it was primarily a walled garden of the kind of the technological elite.

533
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,227
Speaker 0: there was this high barrier to entry.

534
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:07,838
Speaker 0: only like the really techie hit people were there and These were people who generally wouldn't shit cock all over everything mm-hmm.

535
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:20,315
Speaker 0: And there are a million sites that you know like wiki answers and Google answers and Yahoo answers and all this stuff and they all Basically devolve into garbage unless they're continuously pruned and monitored by human.

536
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,940
Speaker 1: well stack overflow is continued.

537
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:30,620
Speaker 0: It's crowdsource to the same Relatively technological people and it caters to this very specific focus group.

538
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,174
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I think you understand that stack exchange is not is separate from stack or I do it like.

539
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:36,840
Speaker 1: stack overflow won't be ruined by.

540
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:46,940
Speaker 0: I think stack exchange is in and of itself cannot possibly succeed because What experts are you gonna get in all these fields who are also technologically competent?

541
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:59,277
Speaker 0: And you're just gonna get people shit cocking if anything and even if you avoid the problem that any Collaborative internet with 2.0 kind of thing has if you ever get them non technological masses to use.

542
00:32:59,337 --> 00:33:07,633
Speaker 0: it is The problem that very few fields outside of science math and technology Have such specific questions with clear.

543
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:08,658
Speaker 0: that is the answer.

544
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:14,900
Speaker 0: answers Yeah, I mean in IT or you know I write like how do I make a script to do X in Python?

545
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:18,707
Speaker 0: There's one answer Maybe two answers.

546
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:19,290
Speaker 1: Yep.

547
00:33:19,471 --> 00:33:21,279
Speaker 0: How do I monitor this as an MP thing?

548
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Speaker 1: Or at least if there are multiple answers, they are either right or wrong.

549
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:27,791
Speaker 1: There is no like questionable if they might be right or wrong.

550
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:28,855
Speaker 1: They're they're working.

551
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,420
Speaker 0: They don't I mean somewhat.

552
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,244
Speaker 0: What's someone gonna ask?

553
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:32,994
Speaker 0: How do I kayak right?

554
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:34,079
Speaker 0: What kayak do I buy?

555
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:39,200
Speaker 1: There's no objective answer to that and Yahoo answers sort of covers that kind of crap.

556
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:42,260
Speaker 0: But I think we should move right on from this and decide wiki if that's something you were gonna bring.

557
00:33:42,682 --> 00:33:47,222
Speaker 1: But one more thing about this right is that even if you're not you're taught You know.

558
00:33:47,282 --> 00:33:51,234
Speaker 1: regardless of the fact that you know the question of yes There are answers or no there aren't.

559
00:33:51,860 --> 00:34:03,069
Speaker 1: Tech people sit at the computer all day Like if you're going from model railroad questions a guy who's working on his model railroad doesn't have you know a computer right there That he's gonna You know rush to every time he has a problem.

560
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:09,158
Speaker 1: tech people are sitting at the computer when we have a problem We google it and stack overflow shows up in the Google results.

561
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,687
Speaker 1: Model railroad exchange.

562
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:13,011
Speaker 1: right that ain't gonna happen.

563
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,100
Speaker 1: model railroad guys aren't sitting at the computer while they're model railroading.

564
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,838
Speaker 1: They're in a room with the table with the railroad on it.

565
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:25,348
Speaker 1: So unless they you know you make the user interface for your website a train It's not gonna work so well.

566
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,600
Speaker 0: and also I mean think of this in general guy is the problem kayaking?

567
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,324
Speaker 1: He's out in the water on a boat.

568
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:35,699
Speaker 0: a programmer knows how to ask a question that another programmer can answer.

569
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:38,505
Speaker 1: Usually you'd be surprised in Stack Overflow.

570
00:34:38,525 --> 00:34:39,329
Speaker 1: pretty bad questions.

571
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,616
Speaker 1: Yeah, they also Google all their problems.

572
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:49,719
Speaker 1: other professions Like carpenters don't Google all their problems the way programmers do so it's just by that very nature.

573
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,665
Speaker 1: It's not gonna work, so well.

574
00:34:50,685 --> 00:34:52,253
Speaker 1: I think a gaming one might work.

575
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:57,580
Speaker 1: Well it might work, okay For tips and tricks kinds of things like how do I beat this part true?

576
00:34:57,801 --> 00:35:00,660
Speaker 1: And I think that could do it really do a good competition with game facts.

577
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:01,869
Speaker 0: Oh, it could destroy game facts.

578
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:03,319
Speaker 0: honestly game facts has to die.

579
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:05,185
Speaker 0: The culture of their.

580
00:35:05,426 --> 00:35:07,914
Speaker 0: you know text only ASCII file are.

581
00:35:08,335 --> 00:35:09,940
Speaker 0: the whole culture of game facts is just crap.

582
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,648
Speaker 1: Hey, why don't we make a game fax is better?

583
00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:12,512
Speaker 1: I mean we could.

584
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:14,340
Speaker 1: you know it doesn't even have to be Stack Overflow.

585
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:15,085
Speaker 1: Let's just be like.

586
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:23,966
Speaker 0: hey, that'd be really you know unlike every other idea We've ever had that would take like a month of us doing it like hardly at all Put it in the hopper.

587
00:35:24,308 --> 00:35:26,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but we could put it near the top of the hopper.

588
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:28,910
Speaker 0: It's much easier to do than our global currency.

589
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:30,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, that has to wait.

590
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:31,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

591
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:37,603
Speaker 1: So yeah you want to talk about this, so here's the side wiki right basically 1994 called.

592
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:39,128
Speaker 0: they want their idea back right.

593
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:45,092
Speaker 1: basically the idea is an old idea, and I've seen at least two or three implementations of this idea.

594
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:48,320
Speaker 1: and the idea is this Why do we need to have comments?

595
00:35:48,561 --> 00:36:00,360
Speaker 1: You know on the websites what we can do is we can just have some separate commenting system where people comment on URLs And then you visit the URL and then your browser will load up the comments for that URL.

596
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:09,460
Speaker 1: So basically everyone is commenting on the web Sites all in one place and you can comment on any site on the whole net whether the site has comments or not.

597
00:36:09,963 --> 00:36:11,090
Speaker 1: And it's an okay idea.

598
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,673
Speaker 0: it well.

599
00:36:11,714 --> 00:36:12,760
Speaker 0: It's at least in theory.

600
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:23,700
Speaker 0: It's a great idea in theory because one there are a lot of times where there's something discussion worthy But many times people with certain agendas will not want anyone to comment in a way that can be associated with their content.

601
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:24,099
Speaker 0: Yep.

602
00:36:24,862 --> 00:36:27,911
Speaker 0: And two it's a great way to like crowds.

603
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:33,940
Speaker 0: you basically would let you in a in the pre masses internet though it before the long November.

604
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:42,079
Speaker 0: You basically could have had the internet the way Tim Berners-Lee imagined it mm-hmm, but now that could never happen.

605
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,344
Speaker 0: no It's just impossible.

606
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:45,734
Speaker 1: so the thing is basically everyone who's implemented this.

607
00:36:45,774 --> 00:36:47,240
Speaker 1: I've saw one a long time ago.

608
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:50,979
Speaker 1: That was like a Firefox extension And it would open up a sidebar in your Firefox.

609
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:55,000
Speaker 0: One of the earliest ones was you could stick post-it notes to websites that were translucent.

610
00:36:55,182 --> 00:36:57,200
Speaker 0: You could bring them in and out and move them around.

611
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:03,732
Speaker 1: So Google's got basically the same thing again called side wiki and the biggest problem I have with it is you need Google toolbar to use it.

612
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:05,180
Speaker 1: It's like fuck Google toolbar.

613
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:13,200
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't want a fucking toolbar just to add this one lousy feature Right and two they say like moderation and all this stuff is coming already too late.

614
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:14,270
Speaker 0: You've got to have that right.

615
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,124
Speaker 1: you gotta have that right away It's no good.

616
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:20,464
Speaker 1: and the second thing they call it side wiki is not a wiki It's just comments.

617
00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:24,420
Speaker 0: if it was any other people's comments if it was a wiki that'd be great of course.

618
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,914
Speaker 0: It would just be the cockboat on every website of course of course.

619
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,864
Speaker 0: see the real problem here What.

620
00:37:29,904 --> 00:37:31,011
Speaker 0: but well now there are two things.

621
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:32,239
Speaker 0: the real problem is that again?

622
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,610
Speaker 0: To be perfectly blunt and to use the you know angry video game.

623
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,127
Speaker 0: there the masses shit all over everything And there's no way to stop them.

624
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:45,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that aside Most of the people who are against this are not against it for any of the reasons.

625
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:46,500
Speaker 0: We've brought up.

626
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,760
Speaker 1: No, they're against it because they don't want someone to comment on their no comment site and all like that.

627
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,880
Speaker 1: You know like a news website that forces you to log in to comment there.

628
00:37:54,181 --> 00:38:05,125
Speaker 1: They don't want you leaving a comment so that someone visits there like you know New York Times And then suddenly the side wiki opens up And it says shit cock shit cock poop poop poop plus back in the day You know these post-it note things.

629
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:06,128
Speaker 0: they got sued.

630
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:09,604
Speaker 0: everyone got like sued or threatened to be sued by anyone who would be affected by This.

631
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:10,479
Speaker 1: it's vandalism.

632
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:18,884
Speaker 0: All I have to say these people is that They have no more right to the metadata that is associated with their site But not on their site.

633
00:38:19,426 --> 00:38:20,308
Speaker 0: then they have to.

634
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,297
Speaker 0: I don't know me talking about their website exactly.

635
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:23,979
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

636
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,948
Speaker 0: Yep, it's just a website, but the thing is what it.

637
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:30,658
Speaker 0: it's almost what web 3.0 is going to be.

638
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:35,600
Speaker 0: you know People talk a lot about what web 2.0 was and I think we all generally agree what that is.

639
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:37,205
Speaker 0: No one really agrees.

640
00:38:37,225 --> 00:38:42,019
Speaker 0: know what web 3.0 is a lot of people use stupid BS phrases like the semantic web or whatever.

641
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:51,862
Speaker 0: I Think web 3.0 is going to be when every computer is basically serving and receiving content in pretty much equal amounts Mmm.

642
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:56,620
Speaker 0: That's going to be when there are no more IPs, but that IP v6 and all those things.

643
00:38:56,681 --> 00:39:01,110
Speaker 0: It'll be the day when there are not Monolithic gigantic web servers.

644
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,940
Speaker 0: it is just everything is kind of peer-to-peer.

645
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:08,345
Speaker 0: Everyone's a publisher and everyone's a receiver and It's actually a cloud.

646
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:09,268
Speaker 0: It's actually a web.

647
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,294
Speaker 1: It'd be the federated cloud where it's like.

648
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:13,320
Speaker 1: you don't have you know the Twitter server.

649
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:14,044
Speaker 1: It's everyone.

650
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,940
Speaker 1: You know it's more the Laconica model even though the Laconica itself sucks.

651
00:39:17,062 --> 00:39:26,654
Speaker 1: It has the correct Architecture where every every community or whatever runs their own little server And then the servers federate and such or every person or a family runs their own server.

652
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:28,420
Speaker 1: the world where everyone has their own.

653
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:39,304
Speaker 1: Instead of one big storm cloud Everyone has their own little tiny personal cloud And then all the clouds can sort of send lightning back and forth like even to agree like Google Wave will probably go a long Way toward that.

654
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:48,060
Speaker 0: but even the idea that that web browsers This is the one area web browsers can change fundamentally to where instead of being primarily a get pages and interact with them.

655
00:39:48,462 --> 00:39:51,020
Speaker 0: They are a share information and receive information.

656
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,587
Speaker 1: Well doesn't the new opera have that?

657
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:55,740
Speaker 1: it's a web server and a web browser to serve various things.

658
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:58,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't played with it yet, so I don't want to talk about it.

659
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:06,580
Speaker 0: I think it does have that though, but Extrude that into the future and that is what I would call web 3.0 because that is the next revolution.

660
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:09,782
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what the internet was supposed to be in the beginning But we got.

661
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:23,969
Speaker 0: it's weird how the people who basically pioneered the internet knew exactly what it should have been and no one's like Everyone's basically moved away from that and now they're finally going back to slowly but surely Thing that really just I keep.

662
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,999
Speaker 1: I can't say this enough times, right?

663
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,337
Speaker 1: Computers are like 30. some personal computers are at least 30 something years old.

664
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:38,595
Speaker 1: the internet I mean people normal people have add, you know internet access dial-up came around like what 15 years ago.

665
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:42,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, right and People are still acting like this.

666
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,520
Speaker 1: shit is new and world-changing.

667
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:46,169
Speaker 1: Get with the fucking times.

668
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:51,853
Speaker 1: if the computer can do it tough shit It's done game over if you don't realize it by now.

669
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:52,997
Speaker 1: You're never gonna get it.

670
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:53,740
Speaker 1: You're an old geezer.

671
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:56,350
Speaker 1: Get in the backseat you're done.

672
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,160
Speaker 1: you're not allowed to drive anymore.

673
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:02,055
Speaker 0: No, because if computers are good enough, you don't have to drive anymore.

674
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:02,980
Speaker 0: computers do it for you.

675
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,696
Speaker 1: The point is if you don't get it by now, I mean look at this newspapers are dying.

676
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:10,194
Speaker 1: now You it's not like this jumped out as a surprise.

677
00:41:10,395 --> 00:41:13,401
Speaker 1: you had 15.

678
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:16,712
Speaker 1: Right, oh the music companies and the movie companies, what will they do?

679
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:17,976
Speaker 1: 15 years?

680
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:19,240
Speaker 1: That's a long time.

681
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,332
Speaker 1: The music industry Everyone saw this coming.

682
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:31,513
Speaker 1: Napster was in 1999 10 years ago and you still having a fucking problem Get with it.

683
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:33,406
Speaker 0: We got it.

684
00:41:33,648 --> 00:41:33,930
Speaker 0: We got it.

685
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,060
Speaker 0: There's some topic there.

686
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,560
Speaker 0: We could turn into a show but I'm not sure what other than just kill all the old people.

687
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,414
Speaker 0: Hey hot mama, you want to kill all the humans.

688
00:41:41,656 --> 00:41:42,320
Speaker 1: kill all humans.

689
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,337
Speaker 0: You realize eventually all humans will be old people compared to the computers.

690
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:54,015
Speaker 0: good So so this is gonna be Galaxy Express in the end, is that where we're going?

691
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:55,963
Speaker 1: No, it's gonna be Logan's run All right.

692
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:56,769
Speaker 1: So all right.

693
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,515
Speaker 0: That was your thing.

694
00:41:57,535 --> 00:42:00,765
Speaker 0: I get to do thing Real quick in New Zealand.

695
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:03,995
Speaker 0: They have banned phones as satellite navigation devices.

696
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:05,860
Speaker 0: This is ham-fisted bullshit.

697
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,347
Speaker 0: This just reeks of every prayer.

698
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:08,995
Speaker 1: I'll start with the time 15 years.

699
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:15,196
Speaker 0: Australia and New Zealand when it comes to technology are a little more than fascist dictatorships.

700
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:16,520
Speaker 0: It's just a disaster down there.

701
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:21,500
Speaker 0: The only way it works is that a lot of people seem to just ignore these laws, but think about it.

702
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,308
Speaker 0: They don't want people to be fiddling with their phones and cars.

703
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:28,140
Speaker 0: So they've banned cell phones as sat-nav devices.

704
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:31,559
Speaker 0: My son and even if you mount them on the dashboard, right?

705
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,039
Speaker 0: So you have to buy a sat-nav device a dedicated one.

706
00:42:34,502 --> 00:42:40,908
Speaker 0: I think this was lobbying by like Garmin and I think so too because mice, you know The pre the ball the palm free.

707
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:43,560
Speaker 0: one of the biggest things about it is that they made a deal with spring.

708
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,770
Speaker 0: You get for free a sat-nav.

709
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:48,716
Speaker 0: the same is what you have in your car.

710
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:52,551
Speaker 0: if you mount that on your dashboard It does everything that one of those Garmin things does.

711
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:53,796
Speaker 0: it tells you the directions.

712
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:55,744
Speaker 0: It's all voice It's perfect.

713
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,980
Speaker 0: And you know, they just made that illegal in New Zealand because they're stupid.

714
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,944
Speaker 0: I don't have anything else to say.

715
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:03,420
Speaker 0: people in government retarded unless they work for the census.

716
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:14,083
Speaker 1: Yeah, right where they make nice public domain, you know software packages with nice open API's and everything all right, so I Very very soon.

717
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:20,900
Speaker 1: It's the month of October and there's something special about October's and April's in that those are the months when Ubuntu appears.

718
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:26,955
Speaker 1: So but to 910 which is Ubuntu 2009 October.

719
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:28,079
Speaker 0: is this one gonna be an LTS?

720
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:30,374
Speaker 1: No, the April's gonna be an LTS.

721
00:43:30,535 --> 00:43:31,279
Speaker 0: I'm gonna hold out then.

722
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,300
Speaker 1: So for those you don't know LTS means long-term support.

723
00:43:34,421 --> 00:43:42,120
Speaker 1: That means if you install a long-term support version That means like you can leave it you can use it for like three years and if it's a server five years.

724
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:48,159
Speaker 1: If it's a regular old version like the one that's coming out real soon is it only gets updates for like 18 months?

725
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,929
Speaker 1: I think and then it's game over.

726
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:51,238
Speaker 1: so you've got to keep.

727
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:54,339
Speaker 1: you know If you're using every single version of Ubuntu you got to keep upgrading it.

728
00:43:54,621 --> 00:44:03,260
Speaker 1: But if you use an LTS, which is what I would use on a server You just use the LTS and you ignore the other six months, you know, October April releases and you only use the LTS ones.

729
00:44:03,863 --> 00:44:13,000
Speaker 1: Anyway, this this release that's coming out You know, it's got a lot of new goodies goodies all over the place Right, like Firefox three and a half and such, you know.

730
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:29,400
Speaker 1: One thing it has that I think is the most interesting is the booting is a lot faster like they really really concentrated on the faster booting big time and Basically a long time ago like many releases ago They switched the boot system to this thing called upstart.

731
00:44:30,023 --> 00:44:37,080
Speaker 1: The thing is they didn't really take advantage of it full-on, you know It's like they put it in there, but they didn't really optimize it in the latest release.

732
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:44,115
Speaker 1: They pushed it real real hard And if you have like a solid-state drive your computer's gonna boot in like fucking three seconds.

733
00:44:44,275 --> 00:44:44,997
Speaker 1: It's ludicrous.

734
00:44:45,238 --> 00:44:46,602
Speaker 1: Like I've seen it It's crazy.

735
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:50,396
Speaker 1: So I really can't wait for that because my laptop has a solid-state drive.

736
00:44:51,078 --> 00:44:55,520
Speaker 1: in addition Phronix, which is this website that is very very Linux nerdy.

737
00:44:56,801 --> 00:45:12,420
Speaker 1: They posted they have this benchmark suite the Phronix test suite and they benchmark the Ubuntu alpha of what's gonna come out Or the beta or whatever it is and they compared it to Free BSD and it basically kicked the shit out of free BSD in all but a few categories.

738
00:45:12,902 --> 00:45:16,172
Speaker 1: So the next Ubuntu is gonna be pretty awesome.

739
00:45:16,272 --> 00:45:25,036
Speaker 1: in addition to you know, the usual updates across the board Also, I saw some screencasts of gnome then like the next like gnome 3.0.

740
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:26,620
Speaker 1: Whoo big changes.

741
00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:27,303
Speaker 0: Oh good.

742
00:45:27,463 --> 00:45:39,790
Speaker 1: It doesn't look like, you know, I mean, you know a lot of time you look around at you know Like Linux desktops like a man they're copying OS X man, they're copying Windows this gnome 3. it's got like stuff I never even seen before.

743
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,060
Speaker 1: I don't even know if I like it or not.

744
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:48,128
Speaker 1: I got to use it before I can decide but I'll show you after the the show real quick like some of the stuff they Added like one particular thing is.

745
00:45:48,188 --> 00:45:51,480
Speaker 1: I think I'd have this whole like peek behind the desktop functionality.

746
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:58,360
Speaker 1: It sort of reminds me of Windows 3.1 but not and it's like it looks like some of it was borrowed from the netbook remix.

747
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:03,699
Speaker 1: I don't know what's going on, but it's a big change and Excited just to try out something new.

748
00:46:05,105 --> 00:46:09,740
Speaker 0: So I want to just mention The the reddit issue because it's hilarious.

749
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:11,204
Speaker 0: Here's there's.

750
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:14,540
Speaker 1: there's been a lot of these attacks recently on a wide variety of sites.

751
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,884
Speaker 1: Is there to pull off?

752
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:18,131
Speaker 1: Yep, but shitty security.

753
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:21,220
Speaker 0: Here's the link from slashdot.

754
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:28,140
Speaker 0: I'm going to read the the the headline of this article, which is actually on reddit and I quote what the fuck just happened.

755
00:46:28,601 --> 00:46:33,295
Speaker 0: I opened a comment thread in Firefox and my braids my browser went crazy and posted all this shit.

756
00:46:33,716 --> 00:46:34,378
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

757
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,603
Speaker 1: Yeah Basically the sit.

758
00:46:36,664 --> 00:46:38,612
Speaker 1: I'll explain the technology of the situation.

759
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:39,536
Speaker 0: It's really simple.

760
00:46:39,576 --> 00:46:40,620
Speaker 0: what they did, right?

761
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,620
Speaker 1: So basically a cross-site scripting attack, right?

762
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:44,699
Speaker 1: Is where you put?

763
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,026
Speaker 1: JavaScripts onto someone else's website?

764
00:46:47,106 --> 00:46:52,100
Speaker 1: or you have JavaScripts on your website that do something to someone else's website or something along these lines.

765
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,900
Speaker 1: Right, especially JavaScripts that are that are affecting your website, even though you didn't write them.

766
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:10,980
Speaker 1: Basically what happens is a JavaScript like that, you know because of Ajax and various things can like can do things like post Comments or you know anything like a user can do with JavaScript can be done to the site.

767
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,740
Speaker 0: So they did something similar with flash in that recent live journal exploit.

768
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:23,700
Speaker 0: Yeah You know basically the flash that got called Would use the cross-site scripting to access some other application and edit the last thing you had posted to live journal.

769
00:47:23,961 --> 00:47:26,429
Speaker 1: Basically people are getting hit by this at this kind of attack.

770
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,858
Speaker 1: big-time websites are getting hit by this all over the.

771
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:29,560
Speaker 0: they're not easy.

772
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:35,768
Speaker 1: I mean all you really need to do is get a. you know When you go to a website and you log in you click stay logged in So you're still logged in.

773
00:47:35,788 --> 00:47:36,915
Speaker 1: you go to some other website.

774
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:37,640
Speaker 1: That is nothing to do.

775
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,512
Speaker 1: Let's say you're still logged in to say Twitter you go to some other website.

776
00:47:40,532 --> 00:47:41,255
Speaker 1: That's not Twitter.

777
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,440
Speaker 1: It's I don't know Google, right?

778
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:48,419
Speaker 1: They could make something where you click on it and then it goes over to Twitter and does stuff with your logged in this.

779
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:51,393
Speaker 1: Because Twitter is all not with the good security.

780
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:52,076
Speaker 0: They're not.

781
00:47:52,197 --> 00:47:52,860
Speaker 0: they really are.

782
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,260
Speaker 1: You know, this is one of those situations where it's easy to say Yeah, those people you got a pro crew comm you click on something and suddenly you're sending out a tweet.

783
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,107
Speaker 1: You don't even realize.

784
00:48:00,612 --> 00:48:06,620
Speaker 0: but we you know We had multiple Forums and things on our web server in the past and there are even issues with us.

785
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,469
Speaker 0: Just no one noticed him because we got rid of all that shit.

786
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:08,871
Speaker 0: Yep.

787
00:48:09,294 --> 00:48:13,227
Speaker 1: But anyway the What happened here on reddit is somebody.

788
00:48:13,649 --> 00:48:21,359
Speaker 1: they found something found one JavaScript that basically says when you hover over a link do something and then they combine that with the.

789
00:48:22,206 --> 00:48:23,900
Speaker 1: You know make someone post a comment.

790
00:48:24,021 --> 00:48:25,347
Speaker 1: So basically you would go to reddit.

791
00:48:25,608 --> 00:48:29,467
Speaker 1: you would hover over a link and it would post a comment But it wouldn't just post a comment.

792
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:32,220
Speaker 1: It would post a reply to every single comment on the whole page.

793
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:32,942
Speaker 0: So think about it.

794
00:48:33,183 --> 00:48:35,410
Speaker 0: like three people visit a page exponential.

795
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:40,092
Speaker 1: three people visit the page and suddenly you've got like three six now.

796
00:48:40,132 --> 00:48:45,770
Speaker 0: now Here, here's my joke on Reddit, how would anyone even notice?

797
00:48:46,152 --> 00:48:47,900
Speaker 0: I know right fuck read it seriously.

798
00:48:48,741 --> 00:48:50,087
Speaker 1: Basically, you know what happens right?

799
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,339
Speaker 1: the comment that they're posting is the evil link itself.

800
00:48:54,103 --> 00:48:57,580
Speaker 1: So it's a beautiful page in this awesome way.

801
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:00,349
Speaker 0: It's so beautiful.

802
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:02,780
Speaker 0: Like I can't describe you how happy I am that this happened.

803
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:06,980
Speaker 1: If you're making websites watch out for the cross-eyed scripting attacks.

804
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,328
Speaker 1: You're not embarrassed like all these big-name websites.

805
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:12,540
Speaker 0: how lucky we are to live in this time the first moment in human history.

806
00:49:13,281 --> 00:49:14,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

807
00:49:14,725 --> 00:49:19,417
Speaker 1: and if you are thinking of doing an attack cross-eyed scripting is real easy to do.

808
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:20,520
Speaker 1: just learn some JavaScript.

809
00:49:20,922 --> 00:49:21,486
Speaker 1: It's a joke.

810
00:49:21,687 --> 00:49:26,970
Speaker 0: You can nail big-time websites real easy like yep and it's only it's going to get worse before it gets better.

811
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:32,028
Speaker 0: and really I'm more and more of the mind that the only way to Get things like this fixed is to exploit them a hundred percent.

812
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:34,937
Speaker 0: Yep, because if things aren't exploited people just don't care.

813
00:49:34,957 --> 00:49:41,000
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Alright, this is uh, this is semi gaming news, but I'm approaching this from the tech angle.

814
00:49:41,203 --> 00:49:42,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can wind this down.

815
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,826
Speaker 1: Sony's coming out with this PSP.

816
00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:46,572
Speaker 1: go you might have seen it around.

817
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:47,576
Speaker 1: It's still not out yet.

818
00:49:47,957 --> 00:49:48,479
Speaker 0: Go go go.

819
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:51,406
Speaker 1: It's coming out real soon And the thing is right.

820
00:49:51,948 --> 00:50:01,220
Speaker 1: there's been a lot of talk because it seems like you know I think I read the like EB and what Australia isn't gonna sell it and some other places just aren't gonna sell it.

821
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,720
Speaker 1: It's not really gonna be a problem in the US but it's me a problem in other places.

822
00:50:04,821 --> 00:50:06,960
Speaker 1: We're like stores just don't want to sell this thing.

823
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,432
Speaker 1: And the reason is there's no games for it.

824
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:10,940
Speaker 1: all the games are download games.

825
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:16,915
Speaker 1: So if you're a store you make all your money selling games at big margins and you sell the consoles.

826
00:50:16,955 --> 00:50:18,480
Speaker 1: that like no margin, right?

827
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:22,199
Speaker 1: so why would you sell PSP goes at no margin.

828
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:27,659
Speaker 1: if You're gonna not sell any PSP go games because there are no PSP.

829
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:28,686
Speaker 0: go You know who's gonna sell.

830
00:50:28,706 --> 00:50:29,814
Speaker 0: you can sell it.

831
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:30,640
Speaker 1: our accessories.

832
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:35,680
Speaker 0: The fine thing is this is one more nail in the coffin of game stores for video games.

833
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,815
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's a nail in the coffin of stores period.

834
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:50,180
Speaker 0: but the other thing Here's the thing like a Walmart or a grocery store are the places where these things in things like this going forward in the future Will be sold because some stores will have to exist because you can't easily buy that stuff over the internet.

835
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:52,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly just food stores and clothing.

836
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:53,591
Speaker 0: Yep.

837
00:50:53,772 --> 00:50:56,260
Speaker 0: And even then I buy most of my clothing over the internet.

838
00:50:56,461 --> 00:50:58,730
Speaker 0: Yep, I even buy some of my food over the internet.

839
00:50:58,951 --> 00:50:59,533
Speaker 1: Now his is.

840
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:06,273
Speaker 1: the other thing right is that Sony actually I found out they foresaw this problem.

841
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:07,980
Speaker 1: They're not that stupid, right?

842
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,643
Speaker 1: They knew that.

843
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:11,196
Speaker 1: why would anyone sell this thing on such a you know, a low margin?

844
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:11,900
Speaker 1: if there's no games?

845
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:17,139
Speaker 1: The margin on it is actually jacked up pretty high and the retail some retailers are happy about it.

846
00:51:18,382 --> 00:51:24,820
Speaker 1: So the thing is why would you the consumer buy this thing with a jacked up margin?

847
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,943
Speaker 0: Here's the answer here.

848
00:51:25,963 --> 00:51:30,239
Speaker 1: The answer is buy an old PSP that someone's training in for a PSP.

849
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:32,825
Speaker 1: go That'll be mad cheap.

850
00:51:33,106 --> 00:51:40,880
Speaker 0: They're doing this just to get the retailers to carry him in the beginning and Everyone who knows better all this weight and buy one like next year when they have a massive price cut.

851
00:51:41,088 --> 00:51:52,145
Speaker 1: also if there's a built-in margin like that then places like Amazon are probably gonna be able to sell the thing for a big reduced cost because they're willing to suffer a much smaller margin being An internet store not a GameStop.

852
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:55,194
Speaker 0: I mean like GameStops are basically glorified pawn shops at this point.

853
00:51:55,255 --> 00:52:08,779
Speaker 1: Anyway, yep, and in the end the People I would love to see some statistics about how many games that are sold back to GameStops were originally stolen from other GameStops.

854
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:14,900
Speaker 0: All right, I got one more here and this wrap this up, yeah, there were a bunch of articles recently.

855
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:16,272
Speaker 0: This is starting to happen more and more.

856
00:52:16,332 --> 00:52:17,179
Speaker 0: We're like a bank.

857
00:52:17,642 --> 00:52:23,911
Speaker 0: We'll just you know accidentally email their customer database to like this is a big one And this it's not like.

858
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,300
Speaker 0: this is an isolated thing.

859
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:33,450
Speaker 0: This is happening a lot and ISP emailed like their entire customer list to like half the people who got bills from them recently.

860
00:52:33,952 --> 00:52:35,255
Speaker 0: and the biggest one and this is the.

861
00:52:35,396 --> 00:52:39,708
Speaker 0: this is the one I'll focus on a Bank the Rocky Mountain Bank in Wyoming.

862
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:43,340
Speaker 1: Why is the Rocky Mountain Bank in Wyoming and not Colorado accidentally sent?

863
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,580
Speaker 1: They know the Rocky Mountains extend to collar and to extend into Wyoming.

864
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:53,238
Speaker 0: But the point is this ill stands this gigantic confidential financial document to some dudes.

865
00:52:53,278 --> 00:52:56,567
Speaker 0: Gmail account Now one in the real world.

866
00:52:56,929 --> 00:53:02,091
Speaker 0: if someone mails you something in the physical mail accidentally They're fucked and by law you come shit.

867
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:04,363
Speaker 0: law at the tough shit law It's not.

868
00:53:04,424 --> 00:53:07,899
Speaker 1: and but here if you mail me your social security card, that's mine now.

869
00:53:09,082 --> 00:53:11,642
Speaker 0: Well, it never belonged to the person who mailed it to you I know.

870
00:53:11,723 --> 00:53:14,416
Speaker 1: but I mean if you mail me a hundred dollars, you can't ask for it back.

871
00:53:14,618 --> 00:53:15,100
Speaker 0: It's mine.

872
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:16,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's this whole protection thing.

873
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:19,820
Speaker 0: So you can't like mail someone something and then mail them a bill later, right?

874
00:53:20,381 --> 00:53:29,204
Speaker 0: But basically, you know this company this bank mailed some dude this confidential information and then they'd realized they made a mistake and They went to Google.

875
00:53:29,224 --> 00:53:31,720
Speaker 0: and Google said you know what fuck you come back with a warrant.

876
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:32,280
Speaker 0: That's right.

877
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,860
Speaker 1: Google basically won't give you shit unless you have a subpoena or something.

878
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:50,323
Speaker 0: So they found some stupid judge who agreed with them got a warrant and basically Google was forced by law to cut this dude this guy who hadn't did nothing wrong off from his email account with no knowledge No consent no Notification nothing.

879
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:51,147
Speaker 0: they just locked him out.

880
00:53:51,548 --> 00:53:52,934
Speaker 1: now think about that for a second.

881
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:55,517
Speaker 1: You're right, you know when it's email You're just sort of like, huh?

882
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,579
Speaker 1: Let's say they sent the guy the stuff in the real mail.

883
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:01,190
Speaker 1: That's the equivalent of the judge saying, huh?

884
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,499
Speaker 1: They sent you a confidential document in the mail, huh?

885
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,000
Speaker 1: We're just gonna have to cease the mailman's not gonna visit your house ever again.

886
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:16,980
Speaker 0: In fact, we're gonna have to come and take all the mail we find in your house in case It's one of those documents and we're gonna destroy your mailbox with a sledgehammer just in case just in case.

887
00:54:17,302 --> 00:54:19,780
Speaker 1: That's basically what they did here and I'm just gonna sum this up.

888
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:29,999
Speaker 0: We our governments need to realize that Email and digit and digital stuff like this has to be treated with the same respect that physical stuff.

889
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:30,822
Speaker 1: does I mean?

890
00:54:30,842 --> 00:54:34,640
Speaker 1: the same problem is happening about these three strikes laws that they're getting thrown around in Europe.

891
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:38,660
Speaker 1: Right, if you're accused of copyright infringement three times will turn off your internets.

892
00:54:39,082 --> 00:54:45,630
Speaker 1: Oh, really the same internets that my kids need to do homework and the same internets I need to apply for a job and the same internets that I need.

893
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:49,324
Speaker 1: the Internet's does a lot more than one Thing.

894
00:54:49,484 --> 00:54:50,791
Speaker 1: email does a lot of things.

895
00:54:50,831 --> 00:54:52,460
Speaker 1: These are necessary services.

896
00:54:52,560 --> 00:55:01,740
Speaker 1: You can't cut off someone's entire telephone entire internet entire mail entire whatever just because there's one Thing wrong with it somewhere.

897
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:09,569
Speaker 0: Well, we were talking about this actually you mean Emily the other night and I realized that if I lost access to my email For more than a day or so.

898
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:20,055
Speaker 0: I am basically I'm unable to do a vast but like a large majority of the things that are necessary to my life Like my and not not my physical life.

899
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:24,014
Speaker 1: I mean we're An email a lot less lately, but even so I do need it.

900
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:24,476
Speaker 0: Well, that's cuz.

901
00:55:24,516 --> 00:55:37,380
Speaker 0: I'm the producer here I mean, I'm the one who responds like the 20 geek nights emails every day and arranges everything but also my regular life and You know I can eat and there I can make all the like physical necessities of my life without all this technology.

902
00:55:38,062 --> 00:55:48,457
Speaker 0: But because I have all those things already people like us technological people we live I Guess socially on this like other plane of existence like Wil Wheaton says it best.

903
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:48,698
Speaker 0: Hi.

904
00:55:48,738 --> 00:55:50,319
Speaker 0: I'm Wil Wheaton I come from the internet.

905
00:55:51,062 --> 00:56:07,512
Speaker 0: I have this life on the internet that cannot exist without all of these technological things and Taking them away basically cuts me off from this higher functioning plane of existence in which I exist for the majority of my time And forces me to live this other lower life,

906
00:56:08,154 --> 00:56:08,355
Speaker 1: yep,

907
00:56:08,716 --> 00:56:10,902
Speaker 0: and it is Internet.

908
00:56:11,002 --> 00:56:16,440
Speaker 0: access should be a utility email should be protected the way real mail is and should be like electricity.

909
00:56:17,103 --> 00:56:18,953
Speaker 1: You know, you just get it and that's it.

910
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:20,300
Speaker 1: You got you got an IP address.

911
00:56:20,361 --> 00:56:27,839
Speaker 1: You should get a static IP address, by the way And you should just get an amount of bandwidth and then if you use more you pay more to be metered.

912
00:56:28,281 --> 00:56:31,217
Speaker 1: Fair metering though not BS metering like the cable companies want.

913
00:56:31,237 --> 00:56:39,400
Speaker 1: my mom Should pay five bucks a month because she all she does is barely anything and I should pay maybe a hundred because I'm doing a Ton of shit like uploading geek nights episodes.

914
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:46,579
Speaker 1: It really just comes down to their metering and as technology improves when we get fiber optic cables and whatnot The price got to go down to keep it fair.

915
00:56:47,143 --> 00:56:54,219
Speaker 0: It really just comes down to the fact that you know It's a buzzword and a lot of people don't understand what it means and this is not the show to talk about that.

916
00:56:54,985 --> 00:57:03,100
Speaker 0: net neutrality is Seriously one of the most important issues facing government in the industrialized world today.

917
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:05,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's very difficult because we want net neutrality.

918
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:16,125
Speaker 1: But if we want the government to mandate net neutrality Then we're also giving the government the power to regulate and we don't want to give the government the power to regulate because they suck Ass at it.

919
00:57:16,185 --> 00:57:25,157
Speaker 0: Well beyond that it's difficult to convince Politicians that net neutrality is important when the majority of their constituents are the old men who don't realize 15 years old.

920
00:57:26,182 --> 00:57:41,874
Speaker 0: I'll make a more lucid point that That basically teen years These the majority of their constituents have no conception That it's even a problem and it would not affect them in the near future.

921
00:57:42,195 --> 00:57:44,303
Speaker 0: It's such a long-term Problem.

922
00:57:44,343 --> 00:57:46,373
Speaker 0: We can't even explain to these people what it is.

923
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:48,903
Speaker 1: I think that's why a lot of people are saying It's like a red herring.

924
00:57:48,943 --> 00:57:51,712
Speaker 1: It's a red herring because you know, it's it's not.

925
00:57:51,812 --> 00:57:55,439
Speaker 1: it's not currently an issue immediately It's a long-term thing.

926
00:57:55,582 --> 00:58:00,020
Speaker 0: But in the long run I think it's going to have more far-reaching implications for our society as a whole.

927
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:14,630
Speaker 0: Then even like the national health care debate right now has definitely which is scary to think about but I'm dead serious I think that health care reform right now will not be as meaningful to society in the long run as net neutrality will be.

928
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:19,970
Speaker 0: yeah, I know people think because net neutrality is such a Simpler problem to solve Jesus.

929
00:58:20,332 --> 00:58:25,720
Speaker 1: and you know people think they're like, you know, okay Let's say we came up with some theoretical perfect health care system, right?

930
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,980
Speaker 1: How significant a change is it really gonna make in a short period of time?

931
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,100
Speaker 1: Basically, when you go to the doctor's office, you'll fill out different pieces of paper.

932
00:58:34,361 --> 00:58:37,818
Speaker 0: That's the kind of look at how much the world has changed in 15 years.

933
00:58:39,463 --> 00:58:40,393
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean it.

934
00:58:40,434 --> 00:59:02,080
Speaker 0: this is you know maybe I'm just inspired because I just watched this Carl Sagan thing a million times and I have this urge to read cosmos again, but The Internet has changed our society in ways that I think few people I don't think we mean Scott or even you know Some of the people at the top of technology Really understand the implications and ramifications of the Internet.

935
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,626
Speaker 0: Everyone's trying real hard.

936
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:07,340
Speaker 1: at least some people know that we have to try real hard to understand them.

937
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,563
Speaker 0: But I think our society like society is being changed faster than even the people at the cutting edge Understand.

938
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,454
Speaker 1: most people the vast majority of it's like this.

939
00:59:16,514 --> 00:59:21,050
Speaker 1: society is like not even Like it's like, you know society is made of people.

940
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:30,225
Speaker 1: but it's strange in that somehow this sort of object like Non-human object that is society somehow All right That is people.

941
00:59:30,265 --> 00:59:30,587
Speaker 1: but is?

942
00:59:30,648 --> 00:59:32,640
Speaker 1: it is made of people but is not in and of itself.

943
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,651
Speaker 1: It's getting ahead of all the people.

944
00:59:35,812 --> 00:59:43,620
Speaker 0: it's like it's the it's the intelligence paradox Or if you make it if you could ever possibly make an AI that can become smarter faster than you become smarter.

945
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:49,158
Speaker 0: Eventually the AI will not need you because it can make a eyes faster than itself.

946
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:56,058
Speaker 0: Mmm, and there's this exponential explosion of intelligence and the internet is almost doing that to our society.

947
00:59:56,078 --> 00:59:58,445
Speaker 0: I mean In Wednesday's show.

948
00:59:58,486 --> 00:59:59,894
Speaker 0: I think we talked about ghosts in the shell.

949
00:59:59,914 --> 01:00:09,013
Speaker 0: I remember talking about how Ghost in the shell that universe those ideas are more true to reality than a lot of people would be comfortable to admit.

950
01:00:09,474 --> 01:00:13,539
Speaker 0: and it's easy to say it isn't because you look and It's all this like cyborgs and physical world stuff.

951
01:00:14,121 --> 01:00:21,440
Speaker 0: But if you look at the society of ghosts in the shell, especially I think our society's cyberspace metaphor I think so much the cyber brain metaphor.

952
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,637
Speaker 0: I think our society right now is close to surpassing what happened in ghosts in the shell.

953
01:00:26,677 --> 01:00:29,567
Speaker 0: on a societal level Maybe close ways.

954
01:00:29,607 --> 01:00:31,634
Speaker 0: think about how fast things change in the last five years.

955
01:00:32,056 --> 01:00:33,260
Speaker 0: go five years into the future.

956
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:39,337
Speaker 0: Yeah, I I can't predict more than six or seven months out on tech, but it can't wait.

957
01:00:39,818 --> 01:00:40,380
Speaker 0: I can predict.

958
01:00:40,962 --> 01:00:57,820
Speaker 0: I've reasonably predicted, you know, five to ten years of politics at a time in broad strokes and I can reasonably think I see where Politics and where society and where health care and where all these physical things are going because they're evolving so much more slowly And yet I can't predict where the Internet's going months into the future.

959
01:00:58,402 --> 01:01:01,876
Speaker 0: No, and the internet is probably gonna have more ramifications in the long run.

960
01:01:02,418 --> 01:01:06,557
Speaker 0: Yep I think we should end on that because I kind of want to go to bed and I'm hungry.

961
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:13,631
Speaker 0: Yep I'm not very good at singing songs.

962
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:15,519
Speaker 0: But here's here's a try.

963
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:38,441
Speaker 0: If you wish to make you must first Invent the universe.

964
01:01:39,025 --> 01:01:42,485
Speaker 0: space With a network of.

965
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,449
Speaker 1: You might emerge somewhere else in space.

966
01:01:47,531 --> 01:01:49,136
Speaker 0: Some win else in time.

967
01:01:49,177 --> 01:01:51,324
Speaker 1: the sky calls to us.

968
01:01:51,946 --> 01:01:53,190
Speaker 1: We do not destroy ourselves.

969
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:59,076
Speaker 1: We will one day Enter to the stars.

970
01:01:59,578 --> 01:02:07,770
Speaker 0: the storm or glorious dawn awaits not a sunrise But a galaxy rise a warning filled for a hundred billion suns.

971
01:02:08,852 --> 01:02:10,138
Speaker 0: Why is it of the Milky Way?

972
01:02:10,198 --> 01:02:18,349
Speaker 0: cosmos is full beyond measure Elegant truths of explicit interrelationships of the possum.

973
01:02:20,253 --> 01:02:29,729
Speaker 0: I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this cosmos In which we float like a mode of dust in the morning sky.

974
01:02:30,171 --> 01:02:34,506
Speaker 0: But the brain does much more than just recollect.

975
01:02:34,526 --> 01:02:36,488
Speaker 0: it intercompares See the size.

976
01:02:38,403 --> 01:02:39,488
Speaker 0: It generates abstractions.

977
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:45,909
Speaker 0: The simplest thought like the concept of the number one is an elaborate logical underpinning.

978
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:50,689
Speaker 0: Brain has its own language for testing the structure and consistency of the world.

979
01:02:51,373 --> 01:02:59,360
Speaker 0: Still more glorious dawn awaits The galaxy was a morning film for hundred billion songs.

980
01:03:00,212 --> 01:03:01,748
Speaker 0: the right of the Milky Way.

981
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:16,476
Speaker 0: the sky Calls to us if we do not destroy ourselves We will one day Ventured to the stars.

982
01:03:27,302 --> 01:03:32,155
Speaker 0: For thousands of years people have wondered about the universe.

983
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,960
Speaker 1: did it stretch out forever?

984
01:03:34,703 --> 01:03:36,358
Speaker 0: Or was there a limit?

985
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:44,338
Speaker 0: the big bangs of black holes Dark matter to a possible big crunch of image of the universe.

986
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:47,780
Speaker 0: today It's full of strange sounding ideas.

987
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:57,374
Speaker 0: How lucky we are to live in this time the first moment in human history when we are in fact visiting other worlds.

988
01:03:57,394 --> 01:04:05,443
Speaker 0: a Still more glorious dawn awaits not a sunrise but a galaxy rise a morning filled with 400 billion suns.

989
01:04:07,401 --> 01:04:08,718
Speaker 1: The rise of the Milky Way.

990
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:16,954
Speaker 1: Glorious dawn awaits not a sunrise but a galaxy rise a morning filled with 400 billion suns.

991
01:04:17,802 --> 01:04:19,235
Speaker 0: the rise of the Milky Way.

992
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,300
Speaker 0: The surface of the earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean.

993
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:33,679
Speaker 0: Recently we've waned a little way up and the water seems inviting.

994
01:04:47,452 --> 01:04:50,042
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
