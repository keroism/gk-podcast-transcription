00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:16,920
Speaker 1: We talked a bit about shameless self-promotion.

4
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:19,858
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:25,495
Speaker 1: So what do I always say on Monday man this weekend?

6
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:28,482
Speaker 0: It was so crazy Etc, etc.

7
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:30,769
Speaker 0: Yeah tired blah blah blah.

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,812
Speaker 1: I'm not tired.

9
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:32,794
Speaker 1: It was just a great weekend.

10
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:34,620
Speaker 1: But once again, we were out of town.

11
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:37,840
Speaker 0: Yep, I think it was actually pretty good because you're out of town.

12
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:38,903
Speaker 0: What do we do?

13
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:43,840
Speaker 0: we laid around and not didn't do what you laid around and did nothing.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,884
Speaker 1: We all went for a hike.

15
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:46,892
Speaker 0: Yeah once for a couple hours.

16
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:50,443
Speaker 0: Yeah, the rest of the time you spent laying around True true.

17
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:55,140
Speaker 0: So it was mostly laying around and eating and watching things.

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,051
Speaker 1: Yeah, though most importantly we went to see Lewis black and that other guy.

19
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,876
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I forgot.

20
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:04,793
Speaker 0: No, I didn't forget I'm just being silly.

21
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:10,440
Speaker 1: Okay Yeah, but yeah, we'll see Lewis black live and it was pretty badass.

22
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:15,360
Speaker 1: I haven't gone to see a professional comedian in a long time, but I got to say it sounds silly.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,546
Speaker 1: But I forgot that it's that funny.

24
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:22,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I went to see Lewis black when he was at RIT years ago.

25
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,340
Speaker 0: It cost five bucks and at the time I had listened to his album, you know from downloading it when those are the Napster days.

26
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:34,340
Speaker 0: But so when I went to see him live then I knew all the jokes so it wasn't so exciting.

27
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:36,617
Speaker 0: He told maybe a couple jokes I hadn't heard.

28
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:43,524
Speaker 0: But we went to see him in Albany now and he had all new stuff that I never heard before and I didn't listen to His newer album.

29
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,714
Speaker 0: or maybe it doesn't have an album with those jokes on it.

30
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:47,240
Speaker 0: So it was hysterical.

31
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,579
Speaker 1: Well, he also put out I think a much better performance than he did at RIT.

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it helps these in New York guy and it was the Albany show.

33
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:59,643
Speaker 0: So he kind of know he made a lot of Albany jokes and you know, he knows what's going on, Chris He made Rochester jokes.

34
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,867
Speaker 0: He made Rochester jokes.

35
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:01,348
Speaker 0: Of course.

36
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:02,331
Speaker 0: He's a New York guy.

37
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:04,598
Speaker 0: Rochester is also in New York barely.

38
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,439
Speaker 0: Yeah We made a Rochester joke while talking about Rochester jokes.

39
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:16,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, though the one point of interest that there was a heck not really a heckler but a dumbass in the crowd who?

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,908
Speaker 1: Periodically would yell.

41
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:23,213
Speaker 1: Whoo Or he'd shout out a name like he was making fun of things.

42
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:25,700
Speaker 1: Lewis black was like holy and everyone laughed.

43
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:37,970
Speaker 1: You know, he's doing this whole thing where he's naming names of people who have caused trouble in the news And then this dude just yells out a name and at this point Lewis black has had enough and he's pretty basically Stopped the show and says all right, mister.

44
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,403
Speaker 1: You need to stop this and the guy goes well, he's like that I'm not kidding.

45
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:42,666
Speaker 1: You need to stop this.

46
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:52,879
Speaker 1: these people all paid a lot of money to see me up here doing my comedy and If you want I can just let the show hand over to you and you can yell out funny names all night long.

47
00:02:53,703 --> 00:03:04,550
Speaker 0: Well, I think it was one guy yelled out a name and he actually he didn't yell it out Like yeah, he has yelled out a name like so-and-so and it was a funny name and everyone was like ha ha ha You know Lewis black was like yeah, see that guy.

48
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:08,739
Speaker 1: Okay you not okay Yeah, that other guy just kept trying to yell shit out.

49
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

50
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:15,901
Speaker 1: And finally Lewis black just starts digging into him and basically yelling at him in a. it still ended up being a funny because it's Lewis Black.

51
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:16,162
Speaker 1: yeah,

52
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:32,520
Speaker 0: it was cool because so much like I always thought of him as someone who thinks of his jokes beforehand Then he definitely is he's someone who writes his jokes and then delivers them really really well with his angry, you know Persona, but it was good to see that, you know when there was stuff going on.

53
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,540
Speaker 0: He could be funny just out of nothing as well instead of just delivering pre-written stuff.

54
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:40,571
Speaker 1: I just couldn't believe that the guy he was yelling at didn't get it.

55
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:44,229
Speaker 1: He kept yelling out like stop that I'm Sarah.

56
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:44,612
Speaker 1: Whoo.

57
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:45,700
Speaker 1: I'm not kidding.

58
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:48,549
Speaker 0: And I thought I saw the security go over.

59
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,854
Speaker 1: security did indeed go.

60
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,180
Speaker 0: security found the right guy.

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,852
Speaker 0: They found the right guy found someone and I thought they gave him a talking to.

62
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:56,437
Speaker 1: I want that to security.

63
00:03:56,457 --> 00:03:58,163
Speaker 1: people came from both Sides and I'll.

64
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:01,435
Speaker 1: practically we're about to make the guy leave and he shut the hell up.

65
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:03,746
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's cool Actually, though.

66
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:04,752
Speaker 1: What was the guys that I don't remember?

67
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:05,879
Speaker 1: the guy's name went before him.

68
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:07,944
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's on the internet.

69
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:12,940
Speaker 0: Yes on the Penn Jillette radio show with Lewis black a few weeks ago.

70
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently they're good friends.

71
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:16,880
Speaker 1: All I got to say is the guy was really funny.

72
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't think he was gonna be funny like he started out and I was like, haha You know, but he didn't really do anything.

73
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:25,537
Speaker 0: that spectacular does this joke, but then he did this joke.

74
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:34,754
Speaker 1: Oh, man He'd starts a joke and then he doesn't really finish it and then he goes off on this crazy Tangent that borders on not being funny at all for a while minutes.

75
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:37,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, okay, man Where are you going with this?

76
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:44,800
Speaker 1: And then he brings it back and oh man It comes full circle and I was laughing out loud as hard as I could.

77
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:50,780
Speaker 1: Yeah Once it dawned on me the joke he was making and it dawned on the rest of the audience about the same time.

78
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,704
Speaker 0: It was sort of like this.

79
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:54,759
Speaker 0: not it wasn't like, you know, someone says something and then you're like pop.

80
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:56,838
Speaker 0: It was like say something.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,879
Speaker 1: Indianapolis, Indiana.

82
00:05:06,242 --> 00:05:11,415

00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:04,749
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

104
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,320
Speaker 0: Well, there's so many news is hard to pick just one.

105
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:17,418
Speaker 0: Well, I think last week this I'll do this one because it was relative to our Related to our Thursday episode last week the help we talked about on Thursday who we're gonna vote for.

106
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:21,549
Speaker 0: All right So rim was talking about our congressperson.

107
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,280
Speaker 0: district 19 of New York State is Sue Kelly.

108
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:30,970
Speaker 1: We disagree with her on Everything that humans can disagree on every.

109
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:41,680
Speaker 0: if you look at her voting record and you say hey What if Scott Rubin was the representative instead of Sue Kelly every single vote would have gone the other way every single one.

110
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:46,502
Speaker 0: So rib was talking about her opponent in the current election John Hall,

111
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:47,044
Speaker 1: but

112
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:58,300
Speaker 0: how we were kind of pissed at John Hall because he kept calling us on the phone and it was annoying and We you know We liked him less because the really only reason we like John Hall is because he's the opponent of Sue Kelly.

113
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:03,793
Speaker 1: Also, his platform is very simple and I do not disagree with anything.

114
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:07,907
Speaker 0: he has said yeah, but at the same time He was giving us all these phone calls.

115
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,500
Speaker 0: They were kind of upset and I was sort of like girl.

116
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:11,647
Speaker 0: He shouldn't be calling us.

117
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,693
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll vote for the third guy.

118
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:18,520
Speaker 1: I was getting to the point where I was gonna vote for Sue Kelly just to make sure this guy's spamming me lost.

119
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:19,460
Speaker 0: Whoa, that's crap.

120
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,063
Speaker 0: I would do that.

121
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:24,080
Speaker 1: go that far cuz she's so evil because she is evil in an abstract way.

122
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,364
Speaker 1: This guy was directly affecting my life.

123
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:27,086
Speaker 0: Yeah.

124
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:32,185
Speaker 0: Anyway, it turns out that John Hall wasn't calling us.

125
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:37,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, it was what the Republicans and Sue Kelly was calling us.

126
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:48,939
Speaker 0: and Apparently what's happening is they have this new trick where they'll call you on the phone They'll have a row a machine call you on the phone and the machine will say something like we'd like to talk to you about John Hall.

127
00:07:49,382 --> 00:08:04,880
Speaker 0: He supports good thing good thing good thing good thing and you immediately think This is John Hall telling me to vote for him and you hang up and you hate John Hall You're not gonna vote for him now, but if you continue to listen it says but John Hall is evil evil evil evil evil.

128
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:16,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually Sue Kelly calling you But if you hang up early You hate John Hall because you think he called you and if you stay on the phone You hate John Hall because it says bad things about him.

129
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:16,980
Speaker 1: now.

130
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,865
Speaker 1: I didn't believe Scott.

131
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:28,620
Speaker 1: so then I went through my voicemail because quote unquote John Hall had called me like nine times over the past several days and left voice messages and sure enough They were all actually from Sue Kelly secretly.

132
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:33,845
Speaker 0: The other thing is if you continue if you if you hang up on it It calls you back.

133
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:36,760
Speaker 0: if you don't hang up on it, then it never calls you again.

134
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,160
Speaker 0: It's got.

135
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:52,460
Speaker 0: it's a crazy kind of computer making all these calls and apparently people are reporting this happening Not just in our district with our candidates But in quite a few districts and quite a few different races around the country mostly important races like ours is pretty important.

136
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,529
Speaker 1: Actually, here's my one of my contested.

137
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,452
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, it is.

138
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:57,320
Speaker 1: And also I think John Hall is a good chance of winning.

139
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,807
Speaker 0: I do think so - I hope so.

140
00:08:59,088 --> 00:08:59,852
Speaker 0: Well Kelly's a bitch.

141
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:05,840
Speaker 1: I was listening to NPR It's all politics, which is actually one of my favorite short news politics podcasts.

142
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:09,171
Speaker 1: I listen to one news politics podcast.

143
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:11,560
Speaker 1: So it is in fact my favorite news politics podcast.

144
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:28,510
Speaker 1: but they really sum up the American political situation pretty neutrally in about 10 minutes and They are pretty sure that the Democrats in America are going to take control of the house And they're about 50/50 on them taking control of the Senate.

145
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:31,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, if the voting machines work, it'll it'll turn.

146
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,686
Speaker 1: Well, they're already not working.

147
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:36,180
Speaker 1: I almost use the news that there have been like eight voting machine fuck-ups already.

148
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:40,660
Speaker 0: I think if they get they have electronic voting machines instead of the old-fashioned, you know pull them.

149
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,480
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I'll demand a paper or provisional ballot if there's a die-bold d-bold machine there.

150
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:51,654
Speaker 1: I will definitely vote on paper if there's a machine except half the problems now Or that the machines that read the paper ballots don't work either.

151
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:56,095
Speaker 1: Ah Person's got to read it that people don't and the people are often stupid.

152
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:57,300
Speaker 1: They're not paid very much.

153
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,865
Speaker 0: Well, they're old ladies who volunteer.

154
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:00,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least where we go.

155
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:11,195
Speaker 0: So yeah, apparently I think in New Hampshire There's talks of the Republicans are gonna get in trouble because they admitted they were Setting these calls and they're gonna get fined like five thousand dollars.

156
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:15,680
Speaker 0: Oh, no Yeah, and all kinds of stuff like this is going down now.

157
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:26,437
Speaker 0: So we'll see if this tactic actually gives them an advantage or if in the end The news that they did this tactic gets out and does harm to them.

158
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:27,200
Speaker 1: I don't know.

159
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:35,285
Speaker 1: I just generally dislike spam and I really it bothers me the way our laws are set up Especially when you look at who writes the laws We have.

160
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:41,380
Speaker 1: this do not call list in America Which means if you sign up for it people can't call you to sell their crap.

161
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:45,438
Speaker 1: They can only call you if they want to give a survey which is a stupid loophole.

162
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:53,240
Speaker 0: number one Well, it has to be a nonprofit organization Giving a survey which usually it's like coca-cola can't call up and ask for a survey.

163
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,836
Speaker 1: But coca-cola could fund a nonprofit organization that asks you about coca-cola in a positive way.

164
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:02,256
Speaker 1: They very well could yeah And that happens all the goddamn time.

165
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:05,634
Speaker 1: Yep Second politicians can call you no matter what.

166
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:11,100
Speaker 1: yep now I'm fine with an exemption for so politicians can call the constituents.

167
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:18,061
Speaker 1: However, I am of the mind that that exception should state that the politician himself can call Directly.

168
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:20,629
Speaker 1: none of this pre-recorded message BS.

169
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,876
Speaker 0: Oh, I think that's a good idea.

170
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:24,160
Speaker 1: I thought I was morning.

171
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:28,897
Speaker 0: I was gonna make the exception that says they can call you as long as it's.

172
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:29,640
Speaker 0: you know.

173
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:33,964
Speaker 0: They can give a political call as long as it's not, you know Soliciting votes.

174
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:38,640
Speaker 0: like my congressman can call me to inform me about a bill that he's gonna hold on.

175
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,885
Speaker 1: Here's here's what's wrong with that.

176
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:43,096
Speaker 1: So alright say rim is I'm in the house.

177
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:44,060
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get reelected.

178
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:51,358
Speaker 1: You'll get a call that says rim voted Yes on blah and rim voted yes on blah and rim did this and rim did this.

179
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,362
Speaker 1: All right It was awesome.

180
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:57,180
Speaker 0: call the only thing I can't call within two months of an election in which the hair.

181
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:01,900
Speaker 1: What if there's something important that they have to say to the people, uh, I don't know.

182
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:04,553
Speaker 1: I just say he has to call personally and that's the end of that.

183
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:05,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sounds good.

184
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:06,020
Speaker 0: I'm proud of that.

185
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,763
Speaker 0: I didn't think of that one.

186
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:07,467
Speaker 0: It's great.

187
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,496
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz then I would totally talk to him.

188
00:12:09,878 --> 00:12:13,191
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I mean whenever I meet a politician I always try to.

189
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:15,420
Speaker 1: well at least not a local politician.

190
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,992
Speaker 1: I've met a lot of local politicians.

191
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:17,939
Speaker 1: I really care about him.

192
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:24,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, I'd say that meeting more local politicians has turned me more and more away from trying to get into local politics.

193
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:25,444
Speaker 0: You know what?

194
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:31,836
Speaker 0: I wondered like earlier in the election season I saw those signs everywhere that said Bob for Congress and now I don't see them anymore.

195
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,660
Speaker 0: What happened to that guy?

196
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,433
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about him other than his name was Bob and he's running for car.

197
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:37,136
Speaker 1: What about Bob?

198
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:37,939
Speaker 0: I don't know.

199
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:41,127
Speaker 0: But yeah, I wonder what happened to that guy.

200
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:41,870
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go look him up.

201
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:47,216
Speaker 1: So speaking of wondering what happened to things I'm on a roll with these segues.

202
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,767
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm proud.

203
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:58,946
Speaker 1: a lot of things I've said today Alright.

204
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:08,325
Speaker 1: so anyway, I have For despite the fact that I'm generally anti-war in most cases and I'm not really a pacifist But I'm just generally against war.

205
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:16,300
Speaker 1: but I've always been fairly fascinated with fighter jets and air combat and air tactics and all that sort of thing.

206
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:27,252
Speaker 1: Probably because I grew up next to Selfridge Air National Guard Base, which hosted a great number of f-16 fighters I've flown f-16 fighter Simulators like the actual military ones.

207
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:28,500
Speaker 1: I've hung out with pilots.

208
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:36,054
Speaker 1: I went to all these little programs when I was a kid and I know a lot Relative to how much you'd think someone like me would know about fighter jets.

209
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:47,946
Speaker 1: not saying that I know a lot Far be it from me But one of my probably my third favorite fighter slash bomber ever is the f-117 Nighthawk or stealth fighter.

210
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:52,380
Speaker 1: It's the black triangle the weird-looking thing with all the flat panels on it.

211
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:59,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, not the one that's all you know, not the giant black triangle the little the smaller black triangle.

212
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:00,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, too.

213
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:00,668
Speaker 1: Now.

214
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:07,703
Speaker 1: This was the America's first Production functional as far as we know stealth Aircraft.

215
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:13,140
Speaker 1: it was designated the fighter f-117 a which means it's a fighter.

216
00:14:13,642 --> 00:14:19,590
Speaker 1: But really it was a bomber and there's all sorts of Theories as to why they designated it fighters.

217
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,920
Speaker 1: that a bomber and I you none of you care about any of that.

218
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:24,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really fight against an f-15 or anything.

219
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,715
Speaker 0: It would get shot down if they could see it.

220
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:37,840
Speaker 1: now It is very recently and finally after 25 years of service Many of those years unknown to the vast majority of human beings because it was one of those secret skunkworks projects.

221
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:42,033
Speaker 1: In fact, this thing was used to bomb Panama in like 1989 or something.

222
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,320
Speaker 0: Wasn't it a bitch to fly a parent?

223
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,240
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is it looks really weird and it's very hard to fly.

224
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:55,599
Speaker 1: They had all these funny nicknames for it But the way it actually flew is a computer controlled it and a computer kept it level.

225
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:58,894
Speaker 1: The computer did most of the actual flying.

226
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:03,216
Speaker 1: if the computer died No human being could keep that thing in the air for any amount of time.

227
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:03,900
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

228
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:06,787
Speaker 1: Now actually the f-16 was kind of like that.

229
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:11,560
Speaker 1: the f-16 has a lot of computer stabilization without which it's almost impossible to fly.

230
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:15,914
Speaker 1: But I digress the f-117 stealth fighter bomber.

231
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:17,860
Speaker 1: Well, it's just what I keep getting.

232
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,623
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get on that.

233
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:23,540
Speaker 1: the f-117 has been retired much like yes, our 71 blackbird was retired.

234
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:26,470
Speaker 0: Oh, but the blackbird is like the coolest thing ever.

235
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,015
Speaker 0: It's still useful.

236
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:30,687
Speaker 0: the x-men get use out of it Don't not?

237
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:36,367
Speaker 1: with that they need the sheer technology Yeah, which we don't have yet the she are tech.

238
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:38,673
Speaker 1: whatever stupid underwear pervert comics.

239
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:40,437
Speaker 0: They got a blackbird though.

240
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:41,460
Speaker 0: It's cool now.

241
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:52,220
Speaker 1: I just know that the news really didn't make a big deal about this and it's probably not a big deal But I think it was a really cool weapon that did a lot of good in the theater of war

242
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:52,923
Speaker 0: And I

243
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:55,335
Speaker 1: think it's progressed technology in a great way.

244
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,380
Speaker 1: I think it was a really neat thing.

245
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:05,121
Speaker 0: My only question is they invented the b2 which is sort of better in almost every way and is the bigger better black triangle Even though it's more expensive I think.

246
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,293
Speaker 0: why did they just stop using the f-117 when they invented the b2 instead of?

247
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:20,072
Speaker 1: one of the main reasons we keep using Older fighter jets when we make a new one is that it costs a lot of money to make new fighter jets and the old ones who don't have enough.

248
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:30,573
Speaker 1: the old ones of any Aircraft the Americans have while generally very inferior to the newest one We've made is still leaps and bounds beyond what most of the world has.

249
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:40,080
Speaker 0: Yeah everything I've read so far Just keep saying that basically all these planes are slowly being replaced with the f-22 Raptor, which looks pretty cool.

250
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:46,319
Speaker 0: It's not black though, but apparently it must be just better than every other goddamn fighter jet there ever was.

251
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,476
Speaker 1: now I have an interesting anecdote about the f-117.

252
00:16:49,706 --> 00:17:09,500
Speaker 1: You see back when we were at RIT I said something about the f-117 out of the blue and Scott through no fault of his own intelligence Decided to try to argue with me saying that the f-117 Was the newer stealth weapon and that the b2 and anything else came out way before?

253
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:17,671
Speaker 0: Because I somehow knew yeah that the I was just using logic, you know That one looks cooler and newer.

254
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:20,579
Speaker 0: therefore it must be cooler and newer But it doesn't look cooler and newer.

255
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,380
Speaker 1: It looks like something that was made because we didn't have enough technology to figure out how to make it better.

256
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:27,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I can tell looking at plane.

257
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,720
Speaker 1: All right, how many planes have you seen that have all flat surfaces?

258
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,556
Speaker 1: All right I guess they got to go to things of the day as much as I want to talk about all this.

259
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:51,346
Speaker 1: other fighter jet stuff Like skunk works and the fact that all all the technology we civilians know about is usually way Behind what they're actually working on.

260
00:17:51,406 --> 00:17:53,574
Speaker 0: but area 51 OMG.

261
00:17:53,875 --> 00:18:04,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not UFOs Yeah, but instead I guess we'll just have to save that for I don't know war week or military week And instead we got things of the day.

262
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:06,120
Speaker 0: You want me to go first?

263
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,363
Speaker 1: I guess so.

264
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:15,485
Speaker 0: I found this flicker photo set from some guy and it's just a bunch of pictures, but they're Flicker photo set.

265
00:18:15,505 --> 00:18:16,610
Speaker 1: that is a bunch of pictures.

266
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,232
Speaker 0: That's right.

267
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:46,779
Speaker 0: The first picture says internet and I go, okay, I look at the next picture and It's like I forget what the order was, but it's like omfg and there's a crazy monster and the next one's like Orly or really and there's two owls there and it's just a bunch of pictures of you know internet words like WTF and teh and all that suchness.

268
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,207
Speaker 0: so and eat.

269
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:56,853
Speaker 0: each little acronym is accompanied by an Illustration which perfectly illustrates the acronym in question and it is high Larry's.

270
00:18:57,033 --> 00:19:00,491
Speaker 1: it seems to be just a small collection of what to internet Actually is.

271
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:10,520
Speaker 0: yeah I'm definitely instead of any time from now on if I have to say ZOMG or early in a post I'm just gonna link to these little pictures on flicker.

272
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:28,630
Speaker 1: You know the whole adding Z to the front of things Really didn't sit well with me and I kind of skipped over it until our friend Jess Whenever she types to me has never not said Z something It's a given point and it kind of grew on me.

273
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,951
Speaker 1: and now I just use it some G. Yep ZOMG zombie his axe is on fire.

274
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of these are particularly hilarious though.

275
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:45,088
Speaker 1: Yeah, well Scott basically saw the site and went huh and immediately clicked on the or really owl and ignored everything else for a good Several minutes, of course, of course.

276
00:19:45,489 --> 00:19:45,951
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

277
00:19:45,971 --> 00:19:46,714
Speaker 0: Yeah, really?

278
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:54,220
Speaker 1: No way way Alright, so I discovered this kind of randomly and I wasn't sure what it was because it's kind of weird.

279
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:57,178
Speaker 1: But then you figure out what they're doing and it's kind of cool.

280
00:19:57,459 --> 00:20:03,800
Speaker 1: now I'll start out by saying that a few people have said on the internets that this video is fake.

281
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:10,180
Speaker 1: They sped it up to which I say no shit That's the point.

282
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,807
Speaker 1: Good God It's not fake.

283
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:16,985
Speaker 1: if you intended it to be that way Renault did.

284
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:19,777
Speaker 1: this cool thing looks like it's for some f1 race or something some little.

285
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:32,220
Speaker 1: hey Hello, look at us and they got a bunch of people and they have little placards that they hold up with colors on them And they act out a little f1 video game scene real quick from the top down and it's really kind of cool.

286
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:34,368
Speaker 0: We should do this only with pac-man's.

287
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:44,744
Speaker 0: with pac-man's you say yeah, we just have like a. You know like a guy a pellet runs into the pac-man as the pac-man opens and closes and then a pellet runs out the back Of the pac-man.

288
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:46,980
Speaker 0: Oh, it doesn't run out the back of the back man.

289
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:55,139
Speaker 1: I was gonna say unless pac-man has the diarrhea's Pac-man has the diarrhea's sucks for the ghosts.

290
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:00,014
Speaker 1: So with the elections coming up, we decided we'd talk those eyeballs.

291
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:01,480
Speaker 0: They go right through your digestive system.

292
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:05,883
Speaker 1: a little bit about marketing Marketing.

293
00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:07,250
Speaker 0: you say what do we know about that?

294
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,360
Speaker 1: Well, we know about internet marketing.

295
00:21:09,661 --> 00:21:15,360
Speaker 0: No, we do only but the only the non shady part specifically because you are anti shadiness.

296
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:18,640
Speaker 1: Well, we know all about the shady part, but we're not gonna tell you how to do the shady parts.

297
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:21,071
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we're against the shady parts.

298
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:27,660
Speaker 1: see we've noticed in our forums Not so much mostly because our forums are well patrolled by very angry individuals.

299
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:34,840
Speaker 1: But in the internets as a whole it seems like spam and I don't mean email spam because spam is not related to just email.

300
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:46,596
Speaker 1: If you go to any internet community that is not fully moderated and very carefully watched it will fill With nothing but people linking to their own bullshit and trying to promote it.

301
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:47,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

302
00:21:47,981 --> 00:22:04,118
Speaker 0: it seems like there's different levels of Ethicality in terms of promoting yourself on the internet because everyone's got a website Everyone's got a maybe a video on YouTube or a podcast or a webcomic or something and they want to get the word out.

303
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,980
Speaker 0: and The internet is a crazy way to get the word out because there's millions of people looking at all kinds of shit all the time.

304
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:12,860
Speaker 0: So if there are links to your shit all over the place.

305
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:28,849
Speaker 0: there's more chances of people coming and looking at your shit and thus you becoming popular and awesome and There are many ways to get your links on to already existing popular shit that range from That range from horribly evil to perfectly.

306
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:29,391
Speaker 0: Okay.

307
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:33,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I generally dislike marketing but there's a fine line.

308
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:38,640
Speaker 1: I mean, let's say you're on a community somewhere and you do something cool and you've been there for a while.

309
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,210
Speaker 1: So you say hey guys check out what I just did.

310
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:41,539
Speaker 1: That's probably okay.

311
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:51,053
Speaker 1: but say you want to promote an event and you join a community with the express purpose of promoting your event and not Actually contributing to the community.

312
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,179
Speaker 1: not so cool

313
00:22:52,701 --> 00:23:15,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then what are you gonna do about these people now where there are companies that have people working for them and people hire these companies and What the companies do is they have their employees go out and become members of communities and they contribute to the communities in a valuable way and After about a week they come out with you know, promotions and spam and links and all that kind of crap.

314
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:25,855
Speaker 0: But it looks okay If you just look at the forum and there's no way to know that person isn't actually a legitimate member of the community But is actually an employee of some company being paid to do that.

315
00:23:26,297 --> 00:23:26,960
Speaker 0: What do you do then?

316
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:38,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially when now there's this it's been coming out that a lot of blogs are being paid to say certain kinds of things By very large advertising networks that do it semi shadily.

317
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:46,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, and seriously those bloggers, you know what I guess they feel special that someone's giving them money for blogging.

318
00:23:47,786 --> 00:23:51,240
Speaker 0: Now I can blog and not have to work, you know, they just want money.

319
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:55,650
Speaker 0: They think they made the big time but at the same time What the hell.

320
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,800
Speaker 0: now your blog is worthless.

321
00:23:57,101 --> 00:24:02,416
Speaker 0: The reason people read it before if anyone did read it before is now gone now.

322
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:03,980
Speaker 0: You're just an ad now.

323
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:14,160
Speaker 1: I have a lot of experience trying to generate buzz for things on the internet in generally ethical ways And I think I can safely say that I've never delved below the line of what I would consider shady.

324
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:18,637
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've actually delved low less low than rim has.

325
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,363
Speaker 0: yeah I definitely stay.

326
00:24:20,444 --> 00:24:25,400
Speaker 0: I'll stay away from things that you know, I know aren't considered shady, but I consider them shady.

327
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:31,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, the closest that the lowest I've gotten is that I have Numerous names on the internet.

328
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:41,064
Speaker 1: I have many many many full name Identities on the internet that are not active in communities or anything, but they exist Only have one name.

329
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:50,320
Speaker 1: they exist mostly if I need to get the word out about something I've done and I can if I want like say I want to dig so I want to dig myself for some reason.

330
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:55,159
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna use my own account because that just looks particularly shady to everyone else.

331
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:56,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you're not.

332
00:24:56,767 --> 00:25:06,200
Speaker 0: there's nothing wrong technically with digging yourself But if people notice it and what you've dug isn't that great then they're gonna be like hey and people bury you just for that.

333
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:13,871
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like people generally really don't like it if they see someone promoting something they've done regardless of the actual intent Mm-hmm.

334
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:21,666
Speaker 1: So as a result if I want to if I ever want to promote something that I myself has done I never do it under my own name ever.

335
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:37,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time it's not like I'll just make this secret alternate Identity and join a community and then fake a thousand posts so that in the future I'll be ready to make my evil marketing ploy and it'll be brilliant.

336
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:38,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, ha ha ha.

337
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:45,460
Speaker 1: I just participate in the communities with a different name So no one connects my participation there with my participation somewhere else.

338
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:51,505
Speaker 1: So people can't try to follow me around and see what kind of things I promote what kind of things I don't promote Today's.

339
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,825
Speaker 0: I don't try to promote myself in communities I'm not a member of.

340
00:25:54,906 --> 00:26:01,740
Speaker 0: it's like if I'm a member of a community a legitimate one Then I feel okay once in a while, you know promoting myself.

341
00:26:01,922 --> 00:26:04,143
Speaker 0: If I do something crazy now I won't promote.

342
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:15,479
Speaker 0: I do a lot of things and the thing is if you promote every single thing you do Like if I went posted a link to every single episode of geek nights in the forum of some other Podcasts that I might frequent that's not cool.

343
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,180
Speaker 0: But there's nothing wrong with keeping a link to geek nights in my signature there.

344
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:20,126
Speaker 0: I do that.

345
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:26,300
Speaker 1: in fact, I'd expect that if you're on the internet You should put the signature of whatever cool thing you do there.

346
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:37,511
Speaker 0: So people who seem to like you can see what stuff you've done And then you know if we perhaps come out with a crazy episode of geek nights that that community would care about Then I would say hey guys check it out.

347
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:39,380
Speaker 0: I would also check out.

348
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,109
Speaker 0: You know other things that the community might be interested in.

349
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:43,052
Speaker 0: I'll just promote myself.

350
00:26:43,112 --> 00:26:44,958
Speaker 0: I promote others, which is always okay.

351
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:48,140
Speaker 1: now I mean we could go in a lot of directions with this show.

352
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,807
Speaker 1: so I think I'd like to take a look at

353
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:50,509
Speaker 0: probably

354
00:26:50,530 --> 00:27:02,680
Speaker 1: an example of someone who was doing shady things or Someone who is trying to game a system in order to promote themselves as Opposed to just trying to let themselves naturally become popular if what they're doing is actually worthwhile.

355
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:03,403
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

356
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:06,640
Speaker 1: Now you might remember a while ago Scott linked to this site.

357
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,340
Speaker 1: That's already turned into a complete steaming pile of feces called pop currents.

358
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:13,840
Speaker 1: Ah now we didn't let anyone in the show know.

359
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:20,480
Speaker 1: But as an experiment in the forums only Scott posted and said we want to see if we can game this site.

360
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:28,300
Speaker 0: But for whatever reason yeah, I wanted to experiment with the site see how it worked, you know I mean I had no doubts in my mind.

361
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:31,620
Speaker 0: This site was pretty much just going downhill and no one cared about it.

362
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,652
Speaker 1: so a bunch of people in our forums pop because it's kind of like dig.

363
00:27:34,712 --> 00:27:52,260
Speaker 1: only you can pop things up or down instead of Just digging things up and a bunch of people in the forums went and popped us up and we've got like 30 pops right away And and then everyone stopped because that discussion disappeared And the site was kind of meh and it seems like everyone else was trying to do the same thing.

364
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:53,524
Speaker 1: Hey Everyone is a fan of my thing.

365
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:59,897
Speaker 1: come in here and dig me up like all those stupid lists of top 100 whatever Podcasts or top 10 webcomic whatevers.

366
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:04,511
Speaker 1: Yep Now I ignored the site forgot about it and you know We had our laughs and we went on.

367
00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:16,600
Speaker 1: a few weeks later I went back to the site just curious what had happened and I saw that we have been popped down like 20 times And then I saw that many many things on the site had been popped down a lot.

368
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:28,719
Speaker 1: Then I noticed that most of the people who had popped us down and popped all these other things down had popped down Everything within a genre of whatever and then popped up exactly one thing.

369
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:41,138
Speaker 1: huh and there were numerous different things that had this phenomena surrounding it and it seems like people like This guy here called Brody solo on myspace who has some kind of band or something.

370
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:41,900
Speaker 1: I don't know what he does.

371
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,540
Speaker 1: He seems to have been the biggest perpetrator of this.

372
00:28:44,921 --> 00:28:59,200
Speaker 1: It looks like he either made a bunch of alternate accounts or else got all of his friends to go in pop his Whatever myspace page up and then systematically pop down Anything that is in the same genre or could compete with him in any way, huh?

373
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,165
Speaker 1: Now, why would someone do that?

374
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:03,333
Speaker 0: It is clearly unethical.

375
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:05,260
Speaker 1: It's clearly a bad thing to do.

376
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:14,120
Speaker 1: You're obviously trying to game a system specifically for your own profit And you're trying to resist the natural tendency of things that are actually good coming to the top.

377
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:27,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think what it is is people feel that you know They have something good to share and if it doesn't show up at the top of dig or it doesn't get posted to Slashdot or Fark then no one will ever see it.

378
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:39,684
Speaker 0: It'll stay hidden from the world, you know, they're trying to manufacture the spontaneous and random popularity of things like Numa Numa and All your base and You're really out.

379
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:43,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Numa Numa was just a guy who thought he'd do something funny and he became famous for it.

380
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:48,160
Speaker 1: The million people Star Wars kid who's yes Star Wars kid was awesome.

381
00:29:48,265 --> 00:30:00,373
Speaker 1: Yeah Who sit there and try to do something like that and make themselves internet popular Are doomed to fail because that sort of thing is transparent and shitty Even if it isn't transparent like no one can tell that.

382
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:03,023
Speaker 0: let's say you no one can tell that you're promoting yourself But you're doing it.

383
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:14,520
Speaker 0: Anyway, right the fact that you are promoting yourself, even if no one knows it Immediately means that it's you're not gonna be able to manufacture the spontaneous popularity.

384
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:15,400
Speaker 0: It's the spot.

385
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,600
Speaker 0: It's the completely random discovery of things over time by a bunch of people that makes those things so crazy.

386
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:25,215
Speaker 0: You know if you you can't try to make that it does.

387
00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:26,540
Speaker 0: it's not possible.

388
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:31,739
Speaker 0: If it's if there's any effort involved at all, it's sort of like spoils the soup, you know It's like you make a soup.

389
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,851
Speaker 0: We need water and chicken and maybe put effort into it.

390
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:38,083
Speaker 0: now all of a sudden no one likes anymore because you can tell when There's effort there.

391
00:30:38,244 --> 00:30:42,240
Speaker 0: It's like aha someone tried to make this popular and not holy crap.

392
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,147
Speaker 0: It's some random crazy thing to me.

393
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:47,259
Speaker 1: It just comes down to the methods you use and your rationale behind it.

394
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:49,551
Speaker 1: I mean promoting yourself even.

395
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:56,498
Speaker 1: I mean not shadily obviously But if you buy ads or you put out flyers or you do anything to you know, hey check it out.

396
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:57,644
Speaker 1: I exist That's cool.

397
00:30:58,188 --> 00:31:11,537
Speaker 1: The moment you go beyond that and actively try to put yourself like insinuate yourself into things where you probably don't belong or Actively try to get people to demote or put down anything that competes with you at all.

398
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:13,285
Speaker 1: That's really shady You know.

399
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:14,393
Speaker 0: you look at it.

400
00:31:14,555 --> 00:31:17,368
Speaker 0: It's sort of like Advertising is something that people sell.

401
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:20,220
Speaker 0: and while we buy, you know, who knows what we think of advertising?

402
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:22,415
Speaker 1: Well people know exactly what we think of advertising.

403
00:31:22,536 --> 00:31:30,422
Speaker 0: Yeah But someone trying to do this is sort of like trying to steal free advertising, you know It's like dig.

404
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:32,047
Speaker 0: dig sells ads on dig.

405
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:36,080
Speaker 0: All right, but dig also has content which happens to be links to other things.

406
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,917
Speaker 1: So how many people post a million links to Lou Rockwell?

407
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:40,420
Speaker 1: calm?

408
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:52,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, so trying to artificially get yourself to the top of dig is trying to like sneak an Advertisement into the content section of dig.

409
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:55,464
Speaker 0: you're essentially stealing Advertising from dig.

410
00:31:55,926 --> 00:31:59,679
Speaker 1: now, I don't care about that because advertising is a pretty piss-poor business model.

411
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:00,702
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, what I can?

412
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:05,480
Speaker 1: I just care that people who do this stuff always seem to do it really transparently and shittily.

413
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,895
Speaker 1: You'd think that if they were trying to do this They'd be more like rolling peak Bailey and do it in a somewhat subtle way.

414
00:32:11,935 --> 00:32:13,420
Speaker 0: rolling peak Bailey isn't subtle.

415
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:16,998
Speaker 1: He was for a long time for a little bit till people caught on.

416
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:21,856
Speaker 0: Yeah I think the thing that bothers me the most is this search engine optimization.

417
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:34,397
Speaker 1: God if you ever Contract the services of a search engine optimization person or you ever think that that's an important thing to do or you ever offer a Service like that to paraphrase a semi-famous person kill yourself.

418
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:38,431
Speaker 1: Good God Do I not respect what you do for a living just so people know.

419
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:44,199
Speaker 0: in case you don't know search engine optimization is Basically, I don't know what to call it.

420
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:50,880
Speaker 0: But there are people who really really really want their website to show up on like the front page of Google.

421
00:32:50,961 --> 00:33:03,751
Speaker 0: So let's say your website about anime and you want it to be so that when someone searches for anime on Google or Yahoo or MSN or wherever that on the front page is a link to your site.

422
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:10,469
Speaker 0: You really want that to be the case because that way Supposedly a lot of people visit you when they want to look at anime.

423
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:14,120
Speaker 0: Well, your site isn't popular and no one cares about it.

424
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,134
Speaker 0: It's a brand new website and it doesn't show up on the first page.

425
00:33:17,154 --> 00:33:21,091
Speaker 0: when you search for anime shows up I'm like, oh the tenth page the eleventh page.

426
00:33:21,553 --> 00:33:23,200
Speaker 1: So what are these SEO people try to do?

427
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:32,732
Speaker 1: They try to game the search engine by fucking with your site in order to make your site Artificially have a higher ranking than it actually deserves.

428
00:33:32,853 --> 00:33:39,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, they try to figure out, you know How does the search engine determine what links are on the front page and what links are on the 11th page?

429
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:49,699
Speaker 0: Then they change their site and they change other websites and they do everything they possibly can To get their website to be on the front page instead of the 11th page.

430
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:54,012
Speaker 0: now the thing is the way especially Google.

431
00:33:54,052 --> 00:34:02,045
Speaker 0: the way Google determines who goes on the front page is An algorithm that is based on what's useful It actually can.

432
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:02,326
Speaker 0: you know?

433
00:34:02,426 --> 00:34:09,797
Speaker 0: over time they've learned to develop a method that says ah That is actually a really good site for anime and that is not.

434
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,000
Speaker 1: in fact If you use one of these BS SEO companies you pay them money.

435
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:26,779
Speaker 1: They might make your site go up in Google for a while but Google catches on real quick and your site will probably in the long run be punished and Put down further than it normally would have because they realize you were trying to game them.

436
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:32,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, and not only that but while you might you know get some popularity for yourself.

437
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:37,500
Speaker 0: if you consider a popularity You'll probably just get visits from people who will then leave because your site is crappy.

438
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,786
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean we get on geek nights and keep in mind that we've never even Cared about what kind of things.

439
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:43,188
Speaker 1: search engine.

440
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:49,580
Speaker 0: we have never made a change to our website Which has taken search engine position into consideration.

441
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:52,226
Speaker 0: We changed the website for every pretty much every other reason.

442
00:34:52,286 --> 00:35:01,711
Speaker 1: but search engine optimization our forums alone get hit by hit from people on Google about once every five minutes 24/7.

443
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:07,378
Speaker 0: the trick to getting lots of it from search engines is to make a legitimate website with good content.

444
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,954
Speaker 0: if you're trying to if You need to optimize your site to get it to show up higher in search engines.

445
00:35:13,335 --> 00:35:14,780
Speaker 0: It's probably a crappy site.

446
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,160
Speaker 0: That's why it's showing up low.

447
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,840
Speaker 0: It's an unuseful crappy site and if you're trying to make it go up in search engines you successfully do so.

448
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:29,540
Speaker 0: You're actually ruining the search engine and making it less useful by filling it with crap And putting the actual good sites down lower.

449
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:35,440
Speaker 1: Yeah Try making a nice site that maybe Wikipedia will legitimately link to you thus boosting your pan drag.

450
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:40,900
Speaker 1: Don't go into Wikipedia make a BS article link it to you and then hope no one deletes it.

451
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:47,660
Speaker 0: If you want people to come visit your site have compelling content that people will eventually catch on to and care about.

452
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:53,080
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess case in point I mean we recently started putting flyers out at cons and stuff for geek nights.

453
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:58,360
Speaker 1: But for the first I don't know five months of our existence we never advertised anywhere.

454
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:00,086
Speaker 0: Nope, not a place.

455
00:36:00,247 --> 00:36:02,740
Speaker 1: We didn't even really tell a lot of people we were doing a podcast.

456
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,657
Speaker 1: We figured it would just spread by word of mouth and it did to Australia.

457
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:09,768
Speaker 0: Yep I mean look at all the popular websites right.

458
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:10,731
Speaker 0: look at see boing.

459
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:14,041
Speaker 0: boing is a huge blob dig slash dot far dig slash Not far.

460
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:18,600
Speaker 0: Do you think any of those those sites weren't always huge slash that used to be pretty small?

461
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,600
Speaker 0: Do you think that they did search engine optimization?

462
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:27,516
Speaker 0: No, no, they did not because they have such compelling content and great websites.

463
00:36:27,556 --> 00:36:28,560
Speaker 0: That is not necessary.

464
00:36:29,102 --> 00:36:36,038
Speaker 1: So I guess let's just go over a whole bunch of things and say whether let's talk about all the things that are Okay to do and all the things that are shady to do.

465
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:41,092
Speaker 1: All right, just so we kind of have a nice roundabout way to end this discussion.

466
00:36:41,293 --> 00:36:46,608
Speaker 0: Okay paying for Google ads Perfectly, okay, that's nothing wrong with paying for it.

467
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:50,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you have crazy ads about mesothelioma you pay more.

468
00:36:50,322 --> 00:36:51,212
Speaker 0: So it's a good system.

469
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:56,735
Speaker 1: Yeah Posting a link to your thing in the plugs area of a forum you frequent.

470
00:36:57,016 --> 00:36:58,340
Speaker 0: Oh, it's in the plugs area.

471
00:36:58,621 --> 00:36:59,685
Speaker 0: It's or the plugs thread.

472
00:36:59,866 --> 00:37:00,769
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with that.

473
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:03,440
Speaker 0: That's where plugs are supposed to be which means I won't look at it.

474
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:15,784
Speaker 1: Yeah Making a new thread about the thing you're doing the project you're starting in a forum That is a part of a community of which you've been a member for a long time and have many friends in and are very active And you're a legitimate member.

475
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:20,858
Speaker 0: not you're not just there thinking about one day posting this link one day one day.

476
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:22,358
Speaker 0: Nothing wrong with that.

477
00:37:22,568 --> 00:37:23,379
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

478
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:33,460
Speaker 1: Going to the Otacon forums and posting a thread as your first post about the new anime review site you made Not okay, probably not so great.

479
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:38,276
Speaker 1: No, not posting that same link in three other parts of the Otacon forums.

480
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:39,640
Speaker 0: Not okay.

481
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:41,689
Speaker 1: Not only not okay, but they'll ban you.

482
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,276
Speaker 0: Yeah rightfully so.

483
00:37:43,497 --> 00:37:47,292
Speaker 1: and delete your post Hopefully digging a story that is on your website.

484
00:37:47,754 --> 00:37:49,300
Speaker 0: It's kind of it's technically okay.

485
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,756
Speaker 0: I say the chances of getting more digs might be lower if people notice.

486
00:37:53,957 --> 00:37:54,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate to say it.

487
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,099
Speaker 1: It's one of those situations where it's perfectly okay, but it won't work.

488
00:37:58,602 --> 00:38:07,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if if it's really good like let's say I you know I actually come up I make a video of a crazy Rube Goldberg machine.

489
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:15,211
Speaker 0: I made this the craziest one ever and I put it on YouTube and I dig my own Rube Goldberg machine and It's really that good.

490
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:16,019
Speaker 0: It's gonna get dug.

491
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:20,860
Speaker 0: But you know if it's not that good if it's just as good as the Rube Goldberg machine.

492
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,060
Speaker 0: They made the front page the other day and people notice that I dug it and they make the connection that it's my video.

493
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:30,938
Speaker 0: Then I'm gonna get less digs than the Rube Goldberg machine.

494
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:31,573
Speaker 0: last All right.

495
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:42,600
Speaker 1: So digging a story that is yours with a name that is not obviously yours Which I say is fine because the internet is basically anonymous and you shouldn't ever have to reveal who you are for any reason.

496
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:47,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's nothing wrong with that and you know, you can't.

497
00:38:48,057 --> 00:38:49,140
Speaker 0: it's not really that bad.

498
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,167
Speaker 0: I mean, you're just basically getting a few.

499
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:54,640
Speaker 0: the number of digs you're gonna get back by doing that is insignificant.

500
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,628
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, it's pretty much gonna be the same deal, but you might as well.

501
00:38:57,708 --> 00:39:14,220
Speaker 0: but here's what shady already hiring someone to dig up your story with a bunch of accounts or Making extra accounts and having them all dig your story Yeah, or setting up some sort of script that will create dig accounts and dig your stories.

502
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:19,275
Speaker 1: Telling all your friends to dig your story is not that shady.

503
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:20,880
Speaker 0: It's not that shady.

504
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,470
Speaker 1: It depends a lot on how you go about it.

505
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:32,254
Speaker 1: And I don't really want to go degree I can't really say how many friends you have But it's really just the way you go about it and the type of community you have.

506
00:39:32,796 --> 00:39:36,659
Speaker 1: if your friends are smart And they'll only dig it if it's cool then it's probably okay.

507
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:48,800
Speaker 0: For example, someone recently asked me to go vote for you know They're their friends webcomic in some poll of like best webcomic of the week and I went there and I was gonna vote for it.

508
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,614
Speaker 0: You know whatever but there was a better webcomic there.

509
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:52,840
Speaker 0: So I voted for that.

510
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:54,544
Speaker 1: Yeah, wasn't that much better?

511
00:39:54,705 --> 00:39:58,174
Speaker 0: wasn't that much better, but I can't not vote for penny arcade.

512
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:10,720
Speaker 1: It's sort of like this thing Maybe but then there's like podcast or webcomics out there who whenever like, you know They're one of those ranking sites like the top hundred whatever's this week.

513
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:19,500
Speaker 0: Well, I think the big the big thing is podcast alley Which is this website that lists podcast and I really think the only people who go to podcast alley or podcasters Yeah

514
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,158
Speaker 1: And it seems like the rankings there all they are is every Podcaster tells all their listeners to go to this site and vote for them.

515
00:40:26,379 --> 00:40:27,403
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know what it is.

516
00:40:27,423 --> 00:40:29,449
Speaker 0: Like I don't the only podcast.

517
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:39,357
Speaker 0: Well, no, I can't say the only one but many podcasts I listen to the podcasters will at the end or beginning of their shows say please vote for us on podcast alley.

518
00:40:39,618 --> 00:40:44,194
Speaker 0: the way podcast Alley works is you go there you find the show you want to vote for.

519
00:40:44,295 --> 00:40:53,537
Speaker 0: you type in your email address And then you you go and confirm the email and that show gets one vote and every month All the votes are erased and everyone has to vote again.

520
00:40:53,557 --> 00:41:04,660
Speaker 1: now I hate to tell you all that about these sites because this has existed since the dawn of the Internet's when Where sites appeared and then top 100 where sites appeared?

521
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:15,448
Speaker 1: Basically, these sites are engineered to get you to direct all of your listeners to their site on a regular basis Where they will see ads and generate money for this site.

522
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:19,160
Speaker 1: These sites don't give one flying shit about you.

523
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:33,041
Speaker 1: They're just trying to get you to direct your listeners toward them if the scant Hope that they will somehow in return generate traffic for you When in fact the majority of the people going to these sites go there only to vote for the thing that told them to vote For them.

524
00:41:33,603 --> 00:41:41,273
Speaker 1: Yep, but podcast alley isn't a site full of ads but podcast alley is not that bad But I still generally dislike the idea of it.

525
00:41:41,574 --> 00:41:42,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really see the use.

526
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:55,835
Speaker 0: I mean Podcasts just seem to have this idea that if they get enough votes that they show up in a high ranking on podcast alley That that will somehow bring them a giant pile of listeners in attention, you know, and I just.

527
00:41:56,858 --> 00:41:59,160
Speaker 0: it might be true But I don't really care.

528
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:08,456
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna spend every pot at the end of every podcast telling you all to vote for us in some stupid site and waste Your time especially having to tell you to keep doing it on a regular basis every month.

529
00:42:08,577 --> 00:42:09,380
Speaker 0: go vote for us.

530
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:10,685
Speaker 0: Screw that shit.

531
00:42:11,288 --> 00:42:12,131
Speaker 0: Why should you have to go?

532
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:13,979
Speaker 0: it's a free show, you know.

533
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:17,132
Speaker 0: Why should I go and tell you to go do work for us?

534
00:42:17,232 --> 00:42:19,080
Speaker 0: That doesn't actually get us anything.

535
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:24,957
Speaker 0: It was like go go my listeners go twiddle some bits somewhere.

536
00:42:25,398 --> 00:42:26,060
Speaker 0: do my bidding.

537
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:29,088
Speaker 0: Haha, you watch shows on TV.

538
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:33,200
Speaker 0: They never tell you to go and you know go vote for us on some site.

539
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,104
Speaker 0: You don't do that shit.

540
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:34,928
Speaker 0: It's bullshit.

541
00:42:35,793 --> 00:42:39,980
Speaker 1: I guess all we're really trying to say I mean, we've gotten kind of rambly all over the place.

542
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:42,670
Speaker 1: We didn't really structure our discussion at all.

543
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,116
Speaker 1: We kind of got off on a couple of rants.

544
00:42:44,316 --> 00:42:45,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

545
00:42:45,423 --> 00:42:50,440
Speaker 0: I guess that's what's gonna happen If we don't sit down and make an outline of what we're gonna say.

546
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,069
Speaker 1: Except we never need to do that for Tuesdays Wednesdays or Thursdays.

547
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just those shows are easier.

548
00:42:55,818 --> 00:42:56,240
Speaker 0: What do you want?

549
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I'm also kind of distracted because I really want to go downstairs and get a Klondike bar.

550
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:02,159
Speaker 1: But I want to finish the show first.

551
00:43:03,121 --> 00:43:07,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been thinking Klondike bar Klondike bar for the last eight minutes at least.

552
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:09,920
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about going to read something.

553
00:43:10,102 --> 00:43:11,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got I get your dream.

554
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:14,269
Speaker 1: Yeah But I guess the point here is very simply.

555
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:19,900
Speaker 1: whenever you are going to promote yourself on the internet Before you do whatever you're gonna do just think for a second.

556
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,067
Speaker 1: Does this feel wrong or shady?

557
00:43:22,087 --> 00:43:24,335
Speaker 1: if the answer is no go right ahead.

558
00:43:24,857 --> 00:43:27,875
Speaker 1: if you're not sure Well go to our forums and ask us.

559
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:28,399
Speaker 1: we'll tell you.

560
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:33,120
Speaker 0: And the best way to promote yourself on the internet is to do awesome things.

561
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:39,460
Speaker 0: Yes Believe you do something, you know and you put it on the internet and it's not getting visited as much as you would like.

562
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,559
Speaker 0: Don't try to attract more attention to it.

563
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:52,503
Speaker 1: Try to do something better because if you do something really worthwhile on the internet 95% of the time people will find it on their own Eventually.

564
00:43:52,643 --> 00:44:01,360
Speaker 1: because if you're makes if you make something that is good that people want and people actually want it They're looking for it and they'll eventually find your thing.

565
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:08,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if your thing sucks don't go around messing up sites like dig or delicious popular.

566
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:14,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't tell all your friends to pop your thing and then flop everyone else's thing Brody.

567
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:20,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, just let it be and if your stuff is cool People will find it.

568
00:44:20,688 --> 00:44:22,476
Speaker 1: if you pop it they will come.

569
00:44:22,556 --> 00:44:22,938
Speaker 1: I don't know.

570
00:44:23,802 --> 00:44:27,160
Speaker 0: Just one more example to because I got a complaint about this kid.

571
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:32,200
Speaker 0: There's a kid on YouTube and he makes I guess his own animated videos of some sort.

572
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:45,980
Speaker 0: I'm not sure cuz I'd never watched his shit because I don't like him and He's apparently complaining on YouTube that in the animation category All you see is Naruto Naruto Naruto Naruto Naruto and you don't see his thing.

573
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:55,520
Speaker 0: it doesn't show up and he somehow thinks that he has a right to show up and Naruto shouldn't be there and That it's not fair that he has to compete with Naruto.

574
00:44:56,222 --> 00:44:57,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had to say it kid.

575
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:01,940
Speaker 1: But if your thing was actually that awesome, you wouldn't be competing with Naruto.

576
00:45:02,181 --> 00:45:11,277
Speaker 0: The reason the reason that no one's watching your animations is not because you know They go to the page and all they see is Naruto and they don't think.

577
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:15,560
Speaker 0: you know They don't find your animation somewhere and look at it or whatever.

578
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:20,900
Speaker 0: If your thing was really cool Someone would dig it and it would get dug up.

579
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:28,120
Speaker 0: Hey or something would happen and people would notice it, you know I mean, you don't see all those episodes of Naruto getting a bajillion hits.

580
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,684
Speaker 0: They're just a lot of uploads there.

581
00:45:30,266 --> 00:45:35,439
Speaker 0: that animation page on YouTube doesn't have like a million visitors who are just looking for your stuff.

582
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,466
Speaker 0: It's how shit goes.

583
00:45:37,506 --> 00:45:39,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're probably all looking for Naruto.

584
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:39,979
Speaker 1: Yeah.

585
00:45:40,883 --> 00:45:45,985
Speaker 1: So so even if your thing showed up number one, they'll skip past it to number two Which is Naruto.

586
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:49,640
Speaker 1: character number five kick in and our two character number eight in the face.

587
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:56,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you know and this kid has been complaining that they should make a separate category for original Animations as opposed you

588
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:06,016
Speaker 1: know what on podcast alley They need a category for podcast done by two 20-somethings in downstate, New York about geekery that air four nights a week.

589
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:10,816
Speaker 1: I Mean what kind of bullshit is it that they don't have this category?

590
00:46:10,856 --> 00:46:16,339
Speaker 0: It's not fair I know but even if they did have this category for this guy people are you know?

591
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,370
Speaker 0: Zach's somehow gonna make his stuff better or more popular?
