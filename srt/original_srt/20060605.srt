1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,447
Speaker 1: It's Monday June 5th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:17,589
Speaker 1: tonight We begin our long-running series on how computers work from the very bottom to the very top.

3
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,681
Speaker 1: Let's do this well as is par for the course.

4
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:23,508
Speaker 1: We had another crazy weekend.

5
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:23,588
Speaker 1: yay.

6
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:29,430
Speaker 1: We went to a Philly wizard world which we'll have our full coverage of on Wednesday.

7
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,262
Speaker 0: I think it's actually called wizard world Philly whatever.

8
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,670
Speaker 1: it was a frickin comic-con.

9
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:36,962
Speaker 1: That's what it was and I got my thoughts on that.

10
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,849
Speaker 0: we also went to the beach.

11
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:43,630
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Jersey Shore where our friend Scott Johnson has his crazy awesome new beach house.

12
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:45,462
Speaker 0: Do you like to sit on the beach?

13
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:45,966
Speaker 1: Well?

14
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:46,328
Speaker 1: I do.

15
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:47,827
Speaker 0: Do you like to?

16
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:59,227
Speaker 1: Other euphemism for bitch yeah, yeah It was a good time because ever since go Joe you know moved away from our IT We don't see him as often as we like to.

17
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,929
Speaker 0: so Yeah way down in that Philadelphia, and we're up here in that, New York.

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,155
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not.

19
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:07,209
Speaker 0: it should be easier to get between the two.

20
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:16,464
Speaker 0: But we live just so slightly upstate in New York that it's hard for us to get to i-95 Which is pretty much the only road from New York to Philadelphia.

21
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:18,050
Speaker 0: my dad's got it smart.

22
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,583
Speaker 0: He goes to Philadelphia all the time with the airplanes.

23
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:24,801
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yep I guess we'll just have to make him come out and visit us.

24
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:26,710
Speaker 0: I think that's what we'll have to do.

25
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:35,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's of course you know He has that house on the beach Which we can't make the house on the beach visit us.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,401
Speaker 0: Yeah, if we found a way to teleport the bitch here I'd do it in a second, but we can't though actually what?

27
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:44,369
Speaker 1: the only reason I brought up the Jersey Shore is that we?

28
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:47,209
Speaker 1: Had a moment of geekery.

29
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:49,636
Speaker 0: Now the three moments of geek.

30
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:57,062
Speaker 1: well one particular moment myself Scott and Scott are walking down the boardwalk and suddenly We all stop.

31
00:01:57,364 --> 00:01:58,030
Speaker 0: oh you can tell that one.

32
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,057
Speaker 1: That's yeah that one like.

33
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,666
Speaker 1: we all stop and we all turn to the left And we all look at each other like you hear that.

34
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:05,061
Speaker 1: yeah I hear that and we start looking around.

35
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:11,939
Speaker 0: we don't even say like we didn't even say anything But we all we all knew and we just stopped Kind of turned and started walking into this.

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:22,248
Speaker 0: now on the shore in Jersey and Wildwood on the boardwalk There's all these stores that sell shit like direct the dreckest of dreck the the schlockiest of crap.

37
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:36,189
Speaker 0: We're talking Cheap ass t-shirts with stupid sayings on them and girly Cheap bathing suits, and you know towels that say stuff like Beach inspector or bikini inspector ha ha ha.

38
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:40,082
Speaker 0: You know stupid shit like that plastic shovels for a dollar.

39
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:40,725
Speaker 1: Yep.

40
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,190
Speaker 0: This is just one of those stores.

41
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:43,822
Speaker 0: It's selling mostly girly shit.

42
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:51,868
Speaker 1: now that we wall We all walk in and then we hear it again And we confirm it and we know now that over the radio is playing Ayumi Hamasaki.

43
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:55,818
Speaker 0: now That is the last thing you're going to hear in a place.

44
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:59,094
Speaker 0: That is pretty much McDonald's and MTV.

45
00:02:59,134 --> 00:02:59,616
Speaker 0: well it doesn't.

46
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:08,131
Speaker 0: there are no chains and not a lot of chains in Wildwood is very few but Everything there is pop culture Crap.

47
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,800
Speaker 0: there's nothing that is nerdy or whatever.

48
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:13,689
Speaker 1: now bear in mind that this was also a very girly store.

49
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:22,462
Speaker 1: in fact There was a gaggle of shore girls kind of hanging around inside of it in a big group Mm-hmm and the store guy looks at us and everyone looks at us.

50
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:25,333
Speaker 1: because we walk into the store with our ears caught kind of Looking around.

51
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:26,698
Speaker 1: we find an employee.

52
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:27,882
Speaker 1: We walk over to him.

53
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,669
Speaker 1: We kind of surround him, and he's like uh.

54
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,543
Speaker 1: And then we ask so who's the Ayumi Hamasaki fan?

55
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:35,245
Speaker 0: Yep?

56
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:36,149
Speaker 1: He's like what?

57
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:50,230
Speaker 0: Apparently most people who work on the boardwalk in fact a lot of the people who work in the United States in the summer At summer camps amusement parks boardwalks etcetera are from Europe and other parts around the world.

58
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:54,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyone complaining about you know Mexican immigrants stealing your jobs.

59
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:58,910
Speaker 0: Well, they're only really stealing these jobs from high school and college kids in the u.s.

60
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,199
Speaker 0: Who want to work minimum wage all day long.

61
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,117
Speaker 0: and the thing is you know they come over here to work at a summer camp Or something.

62
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,683
Speaker 0: they get room and board You know somewhere for real cheap.

63
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:20,490
Speaker 0: they get paid minimum wage They get a visa so you know and they get to work here the whole summer at some crap-ass job and in return They get like a week or two of actual vacation in the u.s.

64
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,878
Speaker 0: Where they go around and see stuff.

65
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,710
Speaker 0: or maybe on the weekends they go and see stuff.

66
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,300
Speaker 1: I actually wouldn't mind doing something like that over in Europe.

67
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,590
Speaker 0: You see it's a lot harder for us to do it elsewhere.

68
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:30,835
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's like a whole big Program.

69
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:36,842
Speaker 0: it's very easy for them to come here and do it But for us to do it elsewhere is not as easy, but it's not so hard.

70
00:04:37,063 --> 00:04:40,334
Speaker 1: this guy was obviously very into you know Techno.

71
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:52,450
Speaker 0: he was definitely a European dude And he just you know had a friend who downloaded some cool music on the internet some sort of techno euro mix compilation Which we're pretty sure was the a yumi euro mix compilation.

72
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:55,824
Speaker 0: Yes There are CDs called I a dash euro.

73
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:56,608
Speaker 0: why you are?

74
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:57,050
Speaker 0: Oh mix.

75
00:04:57,593 --> 00:04:59,305
Speaker 0: And I think there's like at least four of these things.

76
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:07,704
Speaker 0: they take a yumi Hamasaki songs and euro be ties them and they make a big mega mix CD And there's like a whole bunch of these things they put out and they're good.

77
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,730
Speaker 1: I mean I'm a huge fan of you.

78
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:10,035
Speaker 0: I have a few of them there.

79
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:13,510
Speaker 1: despite the fact that she is like the idol do like crazy.

80
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,619
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm the Madonna of Japan.

81
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,250
Speaker 0: yeah, she doesn't suck, but you know what I'm convinced.

82
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:20,747
Speaker 0: If I knew what the lyrics meant I would think they were stupid.

83
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:24,470
Speaker 1: honestly You know what I do know what the lyrics mean to a couple of the songs.

84
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:30,889
Speaker 1: I liked him a lot, and I looked it up a while ago, and at least the songs I looked at were actually good songs of their own merit.

85
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know Whatever Forget that I haven't looked at.

86
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,366
Speaker 0: the point is is that there was.

87
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:44,949
Speaker 0: there was a yumi Hamasaki on in a place that it shouldn't be and I guess or it was unexpected for it to be should be everywhere.

88
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:50,569
Speaker 1: our geek Dar is so highly tuned that we immediately picked up on it and sought it out.

89
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:56,830
Speaker 0: Well when a place is so devoid of geekery then some anything geeky at all.

90
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:02,947
Speaker 0: I mean like if a pixelated Mario Like if a McDonald's Mario toy was sitting in the sand.

91
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:03,390
Speaker 0: we'd be like.

92
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:13,749
Speaker 0: But When there's a strong geekery at a convention then only the awesome You know geekery is really stand out and grant we gravitate towards them.

93
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,360
Speaker 1: Other than that we played some arcade games as usual.

94
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,511
Speaker 1: I learned that I still have my DDR skills quite Strongly.

95
00:06:20,932 --> 00:06:22,978
Speaker 0: yeah, my DDR skills are fading slightly.

96
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:23,861
Speaker 0: I got to start playing that.

97
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:26,790
Speaker 0: yes you do or but they're not fading too much.

98
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:35,008
Speaker 0: I can still do pretty much any medium normal songs, and I could still do some crepe maniac songs But not the really hard ones just the normal ones.

99
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:45,109
Speaker 0: yeah We showed up some punk kids who have grown up in the current generation for God to play air hockey Yeah, and you didn't want to play the hockey with the sticks on the whatever because I was in line for DDR.

100
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:51,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the hockey and we did the only new good game that was at the shore because there are other new good arcade games.

101
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,405
Speaker 0: They just didn't have them was House of the Dead 4 where you get an Uzi and it can also.

102
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:01,670
Speaker 0: you can also throw grenades And you can shake the Uzi to get zombies off of you.

103
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:02,476
Speaker 1: It looks pretty good.

104
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:12,752
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely More fun than the you know original house of the dead where you just had the stupid pistol that was weak and had no feedback Or anything.

105
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:14,458
Speaker 0: the shotgun one was good.

106
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:15,181
Speaker 0: That was number three.

107
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:17,348
Speaker 0: I think but this one is definitely fun.

108
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:19,559
Speaker 0: I'll probably beat it when we go down there again.

109
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,410
Speaker 0: They're also some good pinballs.

110
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:26,729
Speaker 1: So in actual news the Pirate Bay, it's back.

111
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:32,870
Speaker 1: Yep, it took him what a few days to get themselves back on their feet despite the volley from the Hollywood.

112
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:37,410
Speaker 0: I think they're back up with a server in Russia Ukraine Holland and somewhere else.

113
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,514
Speaker 0: I don't know now.

114
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:46,809
Speaker 1: normally what's happened in the past is whenever a site like this was taken down a New site would spring up somewhere else, and it was always kind of this whack-a-mole game for the MPAA.

115
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:48,955
Speaker 1: This one didn't work that way.

116
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:51,282
Speaker 1: the MPAA hit this mole and the same.

117
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:52,025
Speaker 1: it just sat there.

118
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,538
Speaker 0: the mole didn't move and as soon As they picked up the mallet.

119
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:55,707
Speaker 0: it popped her right back up.

120
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,860
Speaker 1: I consider this a victory for the free world.

121
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:01,249
Speaker 0: We're going to kick some ass.

122
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:04,646
Speaker 0: Yeah Finally somebody says we will not take your sheet.

123
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:07,907
Speaker 0: of course They say they will not take your heat because they are from the Sweden.

124
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:16,516
Speaker 1: now I would submit that anyone out there who hasn't been to the Pirate's Bay before go there And even if you've been there is often Go there and look at it.

125
00:08:16,556 --> 00:08:21,701
Speaker 1: because they changed their site graphic a little bit to commemorate the fact that once again They kicked Hollywood's ass.

126
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:32,188
Speaker 0: yeah right now They're having some problems of the database which is bound to happen when you move a site like that to four countries from one and From a giant data center to who knows what?

127
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,078
Speaker 0: But I'm sure it'll be back up real soon.

128
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's a technical problem.

129
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:37,549
Speaker 0: who cares?

130
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:41,058
Speaker 0: Alright, so I got a news.

131
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,965
Speaker 0: It's a little bit complicated, so I gotta explain it.

132
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:44,250
Speaker 1: Yeah explain away.

133
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,775
Speaker 0: There's a company called the Vonage.

134
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:47,401
Speaker 0: you may or may not know of this company.

135
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:49,026
Speaker 0: They sell vo IP.

136
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:53,761
Speaker 0: now You might be like hey skype is vo IP and it's free.

137
00:08:54,223 --> 00:09:01,869
Speaker 0: well now you see the problem with this company Basically if you're the kind of person who set up sets up an asterisk server.

138
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,605
Speaker 0: You can pay Vonage for minutes.

139
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:08,459
Speaker 0: now There are also a bunch of other companies that will sell you minutes.

140
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,402
Speaker 0: vo IP minutes.

141
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:11,649
Speaker 0: lots of them shit tons of them.

142
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:17,490
Speaker 0: Vonage isn't the only one but Vonage is probably the biggest one the one that people know that the trusted name.

143
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:22,970
Speaker 0: All the most of the other ones are these companies you never heard of Even though they're still legitimate.

144
00:09:24,116 --> 00:09:26,219
Speaker 0: so Vonage you could also.

145
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:28,430
Speaker 0: you know we have optimum online.

146
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:33,625
Speaker 0: we can also got some on cable and optimum voice where our cable company will sell us vo IP.

147
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:34,928
Speaker 0: if you want.

148
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:45,250
Speaker 0: you can pay Vonage and get a little vo IP phones and plug them into your you know internet router and Talk on the phone and it'll give you a phone number and everything.

149
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:52,035
Speaker 0: So this company Vonage had an IPO Initial public offering.

150
00:09:52,196 --> 00:09:53,660
Speaker 0: yes, that means we are going.

151
00:09:53,681 --> 00:10:00,846
Speaker 0: we are not on the stock market, but now we are And it's the IPO is where you give everyone a chance to buy your stock.

152
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,475
Speaker 0: at the beginning you say This is the beginning.

153
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,290
Speaker 1: yep companies all do it different ways.

154
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:16,989
Speaker 0: I mean Google made a lot of press for doing it in a kind of funny special way yep Which had mixed results, but the point is Vonage had nor a relatively normal IPO except for one little catch.

155
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:25,149
Speaker 0: they said To their customers that they were going to give the customers of Vonage a chance to get in on the IPO.

156
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:27,736
Speaker 0: Okay, that's cool.

157
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:33,377
Speaker 0: That's like if Google came to all the Gmail users and said hey We're gonna let you into the IPO first.

158
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:44,016
Speaker 0: now the way they did this is they said hey customers of Vonage No matter what you guys can buy Vonage shares at $17 a share.

159
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:58,127
Speaker 0: So even if the stock the IPO makes the stock start jumping up crazily if you want to and you fill out this form You know for being a Vonage customer you could buy as many shares you want $70 a share.

160
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:03,417
Speaker 0: I don't know if as many shares as you want, but you know it's a certain number of shares You could buy $17 a share.

161
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:07,508
Speaker 0: Now here's what happened.

162
00:11:08,453 --> 00:11:13,890
Speaker 0: The the assumption by the Vonage customers was oh, this is a great deal because the stock will jump right away.

163
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:19,067
Speaker 0: I'll only pay 17 bucks, and then I'll sell it and I'll make money and it'll help out Vonage.

164
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:19,810
Speaker 0: You know how about me.

165
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:20,500
Speaker 0: It's a great deal.

166
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,230
Speaker 0: Vonage's stock didn't go up.

167
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:26,441
Speaker 0: It went down to $12 a share.

168
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,256
Speaker 0: Yeah So the customers.

169
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:32,500
Speaker 0: what happened?

170
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:39,230
Speaker 0: because they agreed to buy X shares at $17 a share ended up just losing money.

171
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:44,345
Speaker 0: And they had they even though they they still have to pay the $17 a share.

172
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,610
Speaker 0: They can't pay the $12 a share that they should pay.

173
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:52,049
Speaker 0: They had to pay the 17 because that's what they agreed to.

174
00:11:53,371 --> 00:12:03,397
Speaker 0: So they went to the SEC the Security Exchange Commission and said yeah, and the SEC is like uh-huh We're gonna do something about this.

175
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:07,810
Speaker 1: yeah, so Vonage might be in some deep doodoo deep doodoos.

176
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:16,277
Speaker 0: So I think this is the the official end of IPOs being stupid.

177
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:18,930
Speaker 0: crazy profitable stocks go up crazily thing.

178
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:32,510
Speaker 1: Yeah Because it seems like it's the perception among business people these days not like high up business people that people who are running a small business or a company that IPOing is a way to make a whole bunch of money with absolutely no consequences.

179
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,016
Speaker 1: yeah, that Seems to be the way they treat IPOs.

180
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:36,518
Speaker 1: nowadays.

181
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:48,105
Speaker 0: at least the high-tech IPOs seem to be where they start the stock price real low and then everyone buys it because it's a crazy high-tech company and it goes way up.

182
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:56,190
Speaker 0: and The thing is is Vonage isn't profitable and had no plan to be profitable and people didn't go up.

183
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:57,516
Speaker 0: This is telling everyone.

184
00:12:57,797 --> 00:13:02,081
Speaker 0: We don't care how high-tech or fancy you are if you're not gonna be profitable You're not gonna get invested in.

185
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,070
Speaker 1: that's a good change.

186
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:15,667
Speaker 1: I mean for any of you who actually remember the dot-com bust a big part of that was that people who didn't understand Technology would hear about a high-tech company and just pump money into it assuming that high-tech always means good.

187
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:20,516
Speaker 1: I Guess now people are actually looking at what a company does You know.

188
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:21,503
Speaker 1: do they do anything?

189
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:26,804
Speaker 1: there were a lot of companies Not only did not make money, but they didn't do anything.

190
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:33,207
Speaker 1: there were companies that I shit You not did nothing never made a product never did anything, but advertise themselves.

191
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:33,930
Speaker 0: Oh infinium left.

192
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,576
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

193
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:40,665
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy a phantom console, oh, okay, yeah, you know what.

194
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:45,436
Speaker 1: when it comes out, I'll buy it, okay Well, it's gonna come out tomorrow.

195
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,203
Speaker 0: I'm gonna laugh as rim shells out like $800 for this.

196
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:47,464
Speaker 0: nothing.

197
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:50,014
Speaker 1: now You know what I'll do at that point.

198
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:52,283
Speaker 1: break my word not buy it.

199
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:53,066
Speaker 0: you only get three.

200
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,090
Speaker 0: you're gonna waste one on that.

201
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:54,755
Speaker 0: We'll see.

202
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,209
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm gonna have to waste one.

203
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,373
Speaker 0: All right, all right.

204
00:13:58,694 --> 00:13:58,855
Speaker 1: Well.

205
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,400
Speaker 1: I didn't say exactly when I'd buy it.

206
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:01,103
Speaker 1: I could buy it.

207
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:02,367
Speaker 1: You know when my deathbed.

208
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:05,850
Speaker 1: It's true Yeah, it's true got to be tricky with that sort of thing.

209
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,759
Speaker 0: But what if there aren't any left when you'd like?

210
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,743
Speaker 0: what if they're all destroyed?

211
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:10,210
Speaker 1: as long as I tried to buy one?

212
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,801
Speaker 1: That's good enough.

213
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:16,290
Speaker 1: That doesn't count if you gives you if you view word to someone that you'll try to you'll do something you fail to do.

214
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:17,368
Speaker 1: But you try your best.

215
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:22,288
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try my best to buy this car that a Ferrari.

216
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:23,635
Speaker 0: right now I can't afford one.

217
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:23,897
Speaker 0: the end.

218
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,009
Speaker 0: I tried my best at least you tried.

219
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:49,579
Speaker 1: So things of the day in keeping with my List of old old old school things of the day old incredibly old School partly because we haven't found anything particularly new and exciting on the internet recently.

220
00:14:51,222 --> 00:15:00,559
Speaker 1: This is something we discovered at RIT quite some time ago, and it was very popular and very cool and It actually got a lot of people into Daft Punk who otherwise had never heard of them.

221
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:03,712
Speaker 0: If you don't know Daft Punk is too awesome.

222
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:05,140
Speaker 0: They're two French guys.

223
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,159
Speaker 0: You know what who wear?

224
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,291
Speaker 0: Masks, so you don't know what they look like.

225
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:10,202
Speaker 0: so you if you saw them on the street You wouldn't know.

226
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:16,760
Speaker 1: and they make awesome tech knows if you've never heard of Daft Punk And this is the first time you ever heard anything.

227
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:22,817
Speaker 1: I want you to go out whether you like anime or not and buy this DVD called interstellar 5 5 5.

228
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:31,860
Speaker 0: the animation is by Leiji Matsumoto the guy who makes Galaxy Express and all that stuff And it's basically this giant music video of Daft Punk.

229
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:38,300
Speaker 1: It just imagine an entire album and then someone made a movie that is perfectly synced to the album entirely and there's no talking.

230
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,040
Speaker 1: It's really really cool.

231
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:42,548
Speaker 1: And it don't.

232
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,835
Speaker 1: if you were one of those people who I don't like anime Forget that it's anime think of it as something cool and watch it.

233
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:48,740
Speaker 0: It's real.

234
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:52,640
Speaker 0: I think Daft Punk's actual music videos for that album.

235
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:58,160
Speaker 0: What they did is they just cut up this movie and took the piece out that had the song and said that was the mute.

236
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:06,887
Speaker 1: You know that was a music video But this is a little flash that someone made and is very simple like very simple But for some reason it works really well with the song.

237
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:13,592
Speaker 1: more than ever hour after our work is never over down down down And it's to what?

238
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:18,459
Speaker 1: River City Ransom Nark Barbie and a boy in his blob.

239
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love the little dance the boy does.

240
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:28,484
Speaker 0: yep All right, so my thing of the day is Sega Fantasy 6.

241
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:39,460
Speaker 1: Now I'll warn you Scott's thing if you're not a if you're not a video game fan of the older school persuasion as in you know about You know NES and future consoles.

242
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:41,784
Speaker 1: You're not gonna find this funny.

243
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:46,980
Speaker 0: if you've never played Final Fantasy 6 and beaten it you won't understand a lot of the joke.

244
00:16:48,021 --> 00:17:04,339
Speaker 0: But basically this thing they took the ending of Final Fantasy 6 and they replaced all the characters With sprites of video game consoles every console you can imagine There's a Jeep all the consoles that were out at the time when they made.

245
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,018
Speaker 0: well yeah, you're not gonna see any wheeze or anything.

246
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:22,817
Speaker 0: and And The plot is awesome because it matches the history of the consoles as well as matching the Character the the characters in Final Fantasy 6 and the plot of Final Fantasy 6.

247
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:28,019
Speaker 1: and it's high Larius unless you're not old school, and then it's just dumb.

248
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:29,628
Speaker 0: It's sort of.

249
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:31,800
Speaker 0: it's like reading penny arcade if you understand it.

250
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,976
Speaker 0: It's great if your grandma, and you're not old grandma hardcore, and you're just normal grandma.

251
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:36,598
Speaker 0: You won't get it.

252
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:38,849
Speaker 0: Think it's offensive and stupid.

253
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:43,498
Speaker 1: at least penny arcade always as the gaming joke But there's always the puerile joke there along with it.

254
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:48,338
Speaker 0: I also want to point out how the bad guy in Sega Fantasy 6 is BSP.

255
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,393
Speaker 0: That's all I gotta say.

256
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,100
Speaker 1: Alright, so we've been talking a long time on it.

257
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:08,800
Speaker 1: We wanted to do a series like a long series on how computers work Yep, and we've delayed it for many a moon for various reasons ranging from being tired to having news to talk about.

258
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:11,960
Speaker 0: So this series?

259
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:16,183
Speaker 0: I don't know if we're gonna do it every Monday until it's done but probably not.

260
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:25,675
Speaker 0: we're gonna do it a whole lot of Mondays from here on out and You might make a separate feed for it in case someone wants to listen to just this or something like that.

261
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:33,378
Speaker 0: who knows not right now But we're going to tell you Basically I said basically three times today.

262
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:43,478
Speaker 0: We are going to give you our Let's see like zillions of dollars in RIT education for free.

263
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:55,699
Speaker 1: Yep, we're going to start with the basic basic basics of computers and what they are and how they work to the very top - here is how like this operating system does this.

264
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:06,519
Speaker 0: Theoretically if you listen to our podcast and all of these episodes You will know just as much about how a computer works as we do.

265
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:12,460
Speaker 1: Granted that will take you a long time because we are going to do this over a long period of time.

266
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:21,804
Speaker 0: also, we are going to use many simplifications abstractions and analogies so that even the dumbest person can Understand as long as all.

267
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:26,396
Speaker 0: even a dumb person not the dumbest person probably won't understand no matter what.

268
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:29,244
Speaker 1: but dumbest person hasn't figured out how to download geek nights.

269
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:35,705
Speaker 0: the dumbest person it probably has some sort of horrible learning disorder and Won't be able to learn anyway.

270
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:38,876
Speaker 1: either that or is in the White House where you really can't get a good internet connection.

271
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:41,824
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah had to.

272
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,531
Speaker 1: I had to throw some sort of dig in there.

273
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:44,957
Speaker 0: or learning disorder in the white hat.

274
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:45,439
Speaker 1: yeah.

275
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:56,896

Speaker 0: Yeah, geek nights at G at front row crew calm now.

281
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:17,000
Speaker 1: We love audio feedback But it seems like a lot of you are for whatever reason afraid of sending us audio of your voice.

282
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,760
Speaker 1: So if you want to ask a question.

285
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,327
Speaker 0: Or you said something incredibly stupid.

286
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:33,993
Speaker 1: No, you said something incredibly stupid.

287
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,880
Speaker 1: We'll be all about all on about that.

288
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:37,407
Speaker 0: We still haven't received a hate mail.

289
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:38,653
Speaker 1: never I'm waiting.

290
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:43,633
Speaker 1: the closest thing to a hate mail We've gotten is like is male and foreign languages where I wasn't sure what it said.

291
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:44,296
Speaker 0: spam.

292
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:45,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was spam.

293
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,352
Speaker 1: It was Hispanic spam for some Hispanic album.

294
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,600
Speaker 0: You had to know what the hell that was.

295
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were trying.

296
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:50,573
Speaker 1: I think they're trying to get us to shell it.

297
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:51,418
Speaker 0: forget that.

298
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:58,840
Speaker 0: I Don't know why they if they were trying to get us to show something why why do they think we speak Spanish?

299
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,845
Speaker 0: I don't get.

300
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:07,500
Speaker 1: well, I do find it interesting and I say this a lot How many of our listeners are overseas and in foreign countries other than the United States?

301
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,984
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they understand English.

302
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:11,131
Speaker 0: if you don't understand the English language, you can't listen to us.

303
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:15,899
Speaker 1: Maybe they just assume well for bilingual Maybe they're trying to learn English.

304
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:19,570
Speaker 0: I can actually kind of read a Spanish newspaper kinda.

305
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:22,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can surely almost the same in French.

306
00:21:22,793 --> 00:21:23,266
Speaker 0: Yep Like.

307
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:23,959
Speaker 1: I can read.

308
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:24,662
Speaker 1: Like.

309
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:29,739
Speaker 1: I remember I looked up some yamakaze site and I could kind of follow along and I could figure out the gist of it.

310
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:32,859
Speaker 1: But if someone's speaking French to me, it's like whoa there.

311
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:36,971
Speaker 0: Alright, so let's start talking about how a computer works.

312
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:40,220
Speaker 0: But first you must talk about what a computer is.

313
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:43,728
Speaker 1: So then what is a computer?

314
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:44,049
Speaker 1: I mean?

315
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:49,467
Speaker 1: on a fundamental level it doesn't do very much It just does a lot of very little.

316
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:50,510
Speaker 1: very quickly.

317
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,242
Speaker 0: a computer needs three things.

318
00:21:54,603 --> 00:21:56,628
Speaker 0: number one the input.

319
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,615
Speaker 0: it input can be almost anything in could.

320
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:15,860
Speaker 0: input could be a keyboard or a mouse or a touchscreen or a voice or a photo sensor or a Or a retina scan or a photocell or a fingerprint scan or a scanner.

321
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:23,293
Speaker 0: it could be anything that takes information and Gathers it and sends it down a wire.

322
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:24,118
Speaker 0: That's input.

323
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,688
Speaker 0: Step two the processing.

324
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:29,514
Speaker 1: it is deterministic.

325
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:31,400
Speaker 1: computers aren't magic things.

326
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:33,506
Speaker 1: They they are deterministic.

327
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:45,519
Speaker 0: and when if an input comes in you can predict the output with the same computer with the same Program is given the same input It will do the same thing every time unless the computer is broken.

328
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:57,000
Speaker 0: so the processing takes the input and based on the computer because you know different computers do different things will Do some processing on the input it will do something.

329
00:22:57,703 --> 00:23:05,407
Speaker 0: so maybe it's a calculator and it will take the inputs of what buttons you pushed and Process those inputs to create.

330
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:23,330
Speaker 0: the third thing the output which could be the monitor the speakers the The electric zapper that gives you a shock for being stupid the force feedback and the steering wheel the who knows You know the little LCD screen on the calculator is the output,

331
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:25,979
Speaker 1: but that that's all a computer does.

332
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:27,644
Speaker 1: They did they?

333
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:33,900
Speaker 1: just they take input they process it in some deterministic reliable predictable way, and then they output something.

334
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:37,940
Speaker 0: Yep, that's the simplest computer in the universe his.

335
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,598
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing you have to do.

336
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,931
Speaker 0: There's a line between.

337
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:44,560
Speaker 0: a computer doesn't have to be electronic.

338
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:46,364
Speaker 0: You can have a mechanical computer.

339
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:51,416
Speaker 0: any device which takes input process it and makes output is a computer.

340
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:57,627
Speaker 1: and there were in fact prototypical and small Mechanical computers a lot.

341
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:14,820
Speaker 0: first computers are mechanical Pascal and damage made mechanical wooden slash Whatever adding machines and you can go Go on to Wikipedia and read about Blaise Pascal, and I don't know Babbage's of the name, but yeah Babbage There probably isn't another Babbage to read about now these computers.

342
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:22,959
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm actually reading a sci-fi about that right now, but computers that are mechanical are no different than the computers that electrical other than the way they function.

343
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:31,520
Speaker 1: and It's really only a matter of the fact that Mechanical computers were very large very slow and very unreliable and expensive.

344
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:41,705
Speaker 0: Yep in the really in the future what the scientists are working on it's sort of like a cold fusion where it might not work but they're trying anyway is Quantum computers that aren't even electronic.

345
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:42,567
Speaker 0: They're quantum.

346
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:45,294
Speaker 0: so the processing is all done by quantum physics.

347
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:46,377
Speaker 0: crazy bullshit.

348
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:48,604
Speaker 0: the problem with that Not bullshit, but crazy.

349
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:50,150
Speaker 1: it's a problem with those computers.

350
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,840
Speaker 1: Is that we don't actually understand quantum physics?

351
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,267
Speaker 0: No, we don't know what does?

352
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:55,553
Speaker 1: we know a lot about it.

353
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:57,000
Speaker 1: We can predict quantum physics.

354
00:24:57,281 --> 00:25:01,940
Speaker 1: We know that if we do X Y happens, and it happens reliable, but we don't know the in-between.

355
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:05,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we don't know why and every now and then it doesn't work.

356
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,785
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

357
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,620
Speaker 0: when you make a computer you need to know the whole in-between.

358
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,590
Speaker 0: Because that's the thing about computers.

359
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:13,340
Speaker 1: because really I can't stress this enough.

360
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:16,120
Speaker 1: I know I've said it a bunch of times, but computers are deterministic.

361
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:19,088
Speaker 1: They are exact for any given input.

362
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,676
Speaker 1: the output will always always be the same.

363
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:32,756
Speaker 0: if I have a functioning calculator That is correctly programmed, and I press 1 plus 1 equals It'll say 2. if I do it again It'll say 2 no matter how many times they do it as long as the calculator isn't broken.

364
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:37,523
Speaker 1: It'll say - yeah I was about to say unless it's a penny one That's right.

365
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:38,347
Speaker 1: That's the story.

366
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:40,315
Speaker 0: We can tell when we get as long as it isn't broken.

367
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:53,400
Speaker 0: It'll say - Okay so When people ask you how a computer works The common answer is zeros and ones zeros and ones.

368
00:25:54,422 --> 00:26:00,392
Speaker 0: Now who out there thinks they're little zeros and little ones floating around inside a computer?

369
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:02,020
Speaker 0: anybody anybody?

370
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:07,708
Speaker 0: Okay, well obviously you might be smart enough to have said no You know what.

371
00:26:07,728 --> 00:26:09,438
Speaker 1: if anyone answered us right now?

372
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:15,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, if anyone said yes Go home.

373
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:18,920
Speaker 1: if anyone said no go home because you just answered a one-way broadcast.

374
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:25,712
Speaker 0: Seriously there are not little zeros and ones floating around inside your computer.

375
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:31,720
Speaker 1: in fact not only that but the whole idea of a Zero and one is is just a an abstraction.

376
00:26:32,262 --> 00:26:33,244
Speaker 1: Yep, it's an ideal.

377
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,253
Speaker 1: It's something that doesn't actually exist does not really exist.

378
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:37,076
Speaker 0: It's just an idea.

379
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:38,079
Speaker 0: They're arbitrary.

380
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,252
Speaker 0: yep What is in the computer.

381
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:43,675
Speaker 0: well electricity dumbass.

382
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:45,791
Speaker 0: What's in there?

383
00:26:45,832 --> 00:26:46,399
Speaker 0: electricity?

384
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:49,668
Speaker 1: Whole bunch of silicon and all that stuff.

385
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,720
Speaker 0: That's just ways for the electricity to move around.

386
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:56,039
Speaker 1: There's a couple every now and then there's some computers have mechanical things in them.

387
00:26:56,502 --> 00:26:56,985
Speaker 0: That's true.

388
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,480
Speaker 0: a hard drive has like a motor to spin the disk.

389
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, old old old computers had relay some parts of the computer magnetic which is kind of electricity.

390
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:09,070
Speaker 1: I'm gonna let that one slide.

391
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,936
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just being silly.

392
00:27:10,057 --> 00:27:14,364
Speaker 1: okay Okay now Where do we should?

393
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,594
Speaker 1: we probably go a little bit to ones and zeros?

394
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:17,960
Speaker 1: Why do we use ones and zeros?

395
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,204
Speaker 1: Why are one and zero special?

396
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:23,700
Speaker 1: yep because that is the simplest logic that exists.

397
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:28,195
Speaker 1: There is either true or false one or zero yes, or no.

398
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:29,680
Speaker 1: those all mean the same two things.

399
00:27:30,022 --> 00:27:32,919
Speaker 1: It is a perfect dichotomy between yes and no with no middle ground.

400
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:38,020
Speaker 0: Yep, now there are computers that have zero one and two zero one two and three.

401
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:41,640
Speaker 0: But we're not gonna teach you about those computers because they're crazy and no one uses them.

402
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:43,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, some people use them.

403
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:45,720
Speaker 1: actually the Russians did a lot of research in that regard.

404
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:50,860
Speaker 1: I used to know a lot about it because I was really curious about it until I learned that it's mostly complicated and difficult.

405
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:56,443
Speaker 0: Okay, now we're gonna be talking mostly about your computer not computers You're never going to use.

406
00:27:56,644 --> 00:28:00,779
Speaker 1: your computer is basically sitting there millions and millions of time per second going yes.

407
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:03,113
Speaker 1: No yes Yes, no yes, no yes, no no no yes, no yes, no.

408
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:11,116
Speaker 0: in fact There are like millions of yeses and noes and a big mix all at once and then all at once again and all at once again.

409
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,999
Speaker 0: Now what is the zero and the one?

410
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,586
Speaker 0: What's the different?

411
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:18,019
Speaker 0: how do you get from the electricity to the zero and a one?

412
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:18,200
Speaker 0: well?

413
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,233
Speaker 1: That's entirely arbitrary based on whatever you wanted to do as an engineer making a computer.

414
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:27,427
Speaker 0: That's correct, but in terms of normal computing Let's say I have a wire.

415
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:28,713
Speaker 0: It's just a wire.

416
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:33,200
Speaker 0: It's just sitting there at Zero no electricity on the wire.

417
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,420
Speaker 0: Now you get some battery going on and there's some electricity on the wire.

418
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,859
Speaker 0: That's a one coming out the end of that wire.

419
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:43,469
Speaker 1: Now at this point you have to decide.

420
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:45,820
Speaker 1: What's the line between zero and one?

421
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,490
Speaker 1: I mean what if there's a little bit of static electricity going down?

422
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,334
Speaker 1: does that count as a one?

423
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,705
Speaker 1: because it's either one or zero At any given time?

424
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:54,760
Speaker 0: yeah, what if there's like a little bit of electricity on the wire?

425
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:57,020
Speaker 0: What if there's too much electricity on the wire whoa?

426
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:05,680
Speaker 1: So a nice real simple way because this is basically how most logic works Is that they'll set a voltage like say three volts or nine volts?

427
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,583
Speaker 0: I think it's five.

428
00:29:06,603 --> 00:29:06,864
Speaker 0: is the?

429
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:09,113
Speaker 0: is the basically what people go on these days.

430
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:16,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, though networking and telephony Yeah, but they'll say like if the voltage is three or greater Then it is a one.

431
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:22,687
Speaker 1: if the voltage well We're not going to talk about polarity if it's three if it's greater than three It's a one if it's less than three.

432
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:28,580
Speaker 0: It's a zero yep, and sometimes There'll be a buffer zone in the middle and sometimes there'll be all kinds of other crazy stuff.

433
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,749
Speaker 0: But all you have to know is that you have a wire and if there's electricity coming down the wire at certain voltage It's one and if there's no electricity.

434
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,532
Speaker 0: That's a zero.

435
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,969
Speaker 1: and the electricity I mean It's an analog wave going down the wire.

436
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:50,448
Speaker 1: so it can be all over the place and these thresholds To convert that into ones and zeros and they can be done perfectly Mm-hmm because it's all logic.

437
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:55,047
Speaker 1: at that point you say once you say I'm going to define This as a one that's a one.

438
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:57,837
Speaker 1: that is a mathematical one because you defined it.

439
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,693
Speaker 0: yep I think most computers today work on five volts.

440
00:30:01,854 --> 00:30:04,546
Speaker 0: tell someone tell me if I'm wrong It's five volts.

441
00:30:04,828 --> 00:30:07,179
Speaker 0: You know is is one and zero volts is zero.

442
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:14,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, well negative five because we are not going to give you a lesson on Physics and electronics and all that business.

443
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,298
Speaker 1: well actually I will but only when I talk about networking Because I because I actually know a lot about that.

444
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:22,934
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this is how a computer works not how you know.

445
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:23,195
Speaker 0: we're not.

446
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:29,119
Speaker 0: we're gonna talk about transistors We're not gonna talk about resistors and capacitors and diodes and all that business.

447
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,258
Speaker 0: Okay, so now you have a wire with a one coming out of it.

448
00:30:35,262 --> 00:30:36,848
Speaker 0: How do you make this compute?

449
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:40,260
Speaker 0: well the magic of the transistor?

450
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,520
Speaker 1: That that well even before the transistor we had vacuum tubes and before that we had digital logic.

451
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:52,494
Speaker 0: Yep now the vacuum tube and the transistor perform the same function.

452
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:58,551
Speaker 0: the transistor is just Much much smaller and much much more efficient than the vacuum tube.

453
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:03,927
Speaker 0: the vacuum tube is big real big and real dangerous Now real real.

454
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:12,137
Speaker 1: simply all the transistor does is let you Look, it'll a signal will come in and as a result the output will change.

455
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,289
Speaker 1: yep That's in the simplest terms.

456
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:15,658
Speaker 1: That's what a transistor does for you.

457
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:18,108
Speaker 1: So say the picture has.

458
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:31,683
Speaker 1: you've three prongs coming out a little thingy and You've got a circuit that's connected to two of those and then another wire connected to the third one And then when you put a signal to the third wire it lets something go through the other two Mm-hmm.

459
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:37,328
Speaker 0: so here's an example That probably should make sense with an analogy and all that.

460
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:43,960
Speaker 0: all right you have a light bulb you have a battery and You have a transistor.

461
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:53,319
Speaker 0: You have two batteries two batteries a light bulb Transistor fanatical devotion to the Pope fanatical devotion to the Pope and some wires.

462
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:58,492
Speaker 0: There's a wire from one battery to input prong.

463
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:03,037
Speaker 0: one is a wire from the output prong.

464
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:05,792
Speaker 1: I don't know how well this is gonna work without a picture.

465
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:07,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, we really need a picture.

466
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:08,363
Speaker 1: Maybe we should choose.

467
00:32:08,663 --> 00:32:10,168
Speaker 1: you're not gonna do a video cast on this?

468
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,889
Speaker 0: no we're not Okay.

469
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:25,489
Speaker 0: So there's electricity going in one prong and electricity coming from that prong goes through the transistor and out the third prong To the light bulb and then you make a circuit all the way around so that the light bulb actually lights up.

470
00:32:26,752 --> 00:32:29,300
Speaker 0: The middle prong is the control prong.

471
00:32:29,923 --> 00:32:39,331
Speaker 0: so if the middle prong is off The light bulb goes off because it doesn't the transistor won't let the electricity go through the transistor to from the battery to the light Bulb.

472
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:48,729
Speaker 0: if you turn the middle prong on the control prong on Then it allows the electricity to go through to the light bulb and light bulb turns on.

473
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:54,275
Speaker 0: So this is zero on the control prong No light bulb zero.

474
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:55,540
Speaker 0: a one.

475
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,373
Speaker 0: on the control prong up light bulb goes on It's a one.

476
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:11,850
Speaker 1: now all your computer is is billions and billions and billions of those all turning lights on and off on and off on and off all over the place and those Lights turn on other lights the turn on other lights in this cascading chain that collapses into an answer for every given input.

477
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:17,984
Speaker 0: Yep Now imagine this you have a room with a light bulb and there's one switch on the wall.

478
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:20,169
Speaker 0: off is zero on is one.

479
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:31,850
Speaker 0: Now let's say you have two Switches and you have two light bulbs.

480
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,273
Speaker 0: Zero one Zero one.

481
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:36,016
Speaker 0: Yeah.

482
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:48,970
Speaker 1: Yeah now at this point if you didn't pay attention in high school math And you don't know about non 10 base numbers Real briefly base 10 the numbers we use you know one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven.

483
00:33:49,336 --> 00:33:50,232
Speaker 1: That's base 10.

484
00:33:50,232 --> 00:33:51,471
Speaker 1: It's in sets of 10.

485
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:58,310
Speaker 1: That's the numbering system humans use for a variety of reasons because there are 10 digits in base 10 and because we have 10 fingers.

486
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:04,237
Speaker 1: You know, yep, there's a lot of reasons why humans ended up using base 10 and there were some cultures that used other bases Mm-hmm.

487
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:05,390
Speaker 1: They mostly disappeared.

488
00:34:06,072 --> 00:34:17,324
Speaker 0: there is also base 8 which is octal in which the only digits you have at your disposal are 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and The one you'll see most often in computing is hex hexadecimal base 16.

489
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:23,833
Speaker 0: You have 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 ABCDEF at your disposal 16 digits.

490
00:34:24,054 --> 00:34:27,909
Speaker 1: now the only reason hex is used is really an octal isn't used so much anymore.

491
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:32,909
Speaker 1: But hex is a convenient way of just of writing binary.

492
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:38,402
Speaker 0: Binary is base 2. you have two digits 0 and 1.

493
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:56,449
Speaker 1: so counting in binary goes 0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111 a thousand and That's the same as counting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. now obviously you need a lot of Bits a lot of digits to write a large number in binary.

494
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,070
Speaker 0: This is all just different ways of writing numbers.

495
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:09,466
Speaker 0: You know if you want to write the number 16 you write 1 6. if you want to write the number 16 and hexadecimal you write F. It's the same F. Just is 16.

496
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:10,650
Speaker 0: It's a different way of writing a number.

497
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:11,893
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

498
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:16,908
Speaker 0: So writing 7 or in binary is what.

499
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:17,289
Speaker 0: let's see.

500
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:19,233
Speaker 0: See how it.

501
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:23,889
Speaker 0: see why you need hex because I already have to think it's 0 1 1 1. there you go.

502
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:29,565
Speaker 1: Because now just I have a little chart cuz way way back and I was a freshman at RIT.

503
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:39,377
Speaker 1: the hex to binary chart yeah, like my first computer class at RIT like the first ever when I learned about a computer from anyone who actually knew what they Were talking about.

504
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:40,589
Speaker 1: and we learned all about.

505
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,649
Speaker 1: You know binary logic and all that which was really simple and I knew some of it already.

506
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:54,888
Speaker 1: But my first programming project was we had to write all these number base converters and logic converters and all these things in Visual basic, but we weren't allowed to use any of the functions.

507
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,188
Speaker 1: So we had to do it all manually by hand.

508
00:35:57,711 --> 00:36:01,147
Speaker 1: So I made a little chart of binary hexadecimal octal and suck it on my monitor.

509
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:01,830
Speaker 0: That's good one.

510
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:05,089
Speaker 1: It's still stuck there to this day because I'd never bothered it to get rid of it.

511
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:10,950
Speaker 0: Now the reason we use hex because it's so easy is because four binary digits is a hex digit.

512
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:12,093
Speaker 0: Think about it.

513
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:15,481
Speaker 0: four binary digits that means four zeros and ones.

514
00:36:15,662 --> 00:36:20,416
Speaker 0: so that's every number from zero zero zero zero to One one one one.

515
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:24,632
Speaker 0: Well one one one one is 16.

516
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:27,239
Speaker 1: That means on one one one one is 15 sky 15.

517
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,583
Speaker 0: That doesn't matter.

518
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:29,846
Speaker 0: It's the 16th digit.

519
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:31,330
Speaker 0: The zero is in there.

520
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, zero zero zero zero.

521
00:36:32,555 --> 00:36:35,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, here's another nice aside for all of you non computer types.

522
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:40,310
Speaker 1: You might notice that a lot of because that's why I didn't correct Scott earlier when you said F is 16.

523
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:51,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of computer people especially computer programmers more so than IT people when they tell you a number relating computers They might always be one-off from you Because do.

524
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:55,366
Speaker 1: for various reasons a lot of computer people start counting with zero.

525
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:56,750
Speaker 0: You always start counting with zero.

526
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:01,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, but normal people don't do that in the real world in their normal life.

527
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:01,790
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

528
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,896
Speaker 0: I was trying to make it stupid.

529
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:03,459
Speaker 0: But yeah.

530
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess we'll make it a little less stupid.

531
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:12,110
Speaker 1: I was just be wary of that because The more you deal with computers, especially if you start writing code, that's where it'll really appear.

532
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:14,802
Speaker 1: Just remember that zero is the first number.

533
00:37:15,304 --> 00:37:15,525
Speaker 0: Yep.

534
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:21,123
Speaker 1: Zero is one But it's not one because it means zero but it's also just a number.

535
00:37:21,143 --> 00:37:23,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the first number is zero.

536
00:37:24,232 --> 00:37:26,941
Speaker 0: So one one one one is 15.

537
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:28,848
Speaker 0: F is 15 zero zero zero.

538
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:31,068
Speaker 0: zero is zero Zero is zero.

539
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:51,230
Speaker 0: So you with four binary digits four zeros and ones you can do Every single hex digit zero through F. So if you take any binary number or just a series of zeros and ones break it up into groups of four You can easily convert it into hex and vice versa.

540
00:37:51,793 --> 00:38:00,630
Speaker 0: That's why computer programmers and people always write things in hex Because to write it in binary would be incredibly long and writing in hex is four times shorter.

541
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:05,381
Speaker 1: Now you might be wondering at this point All right, so I have my light bulb switch and that works.

542
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:06,667
Speaker 1: now my two light bulb switches.

543
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:07,150
Speaker 1: that works.

544
00:38:08,031 --> 00:38:09,214
Speaker 0: How do I have your numbers?

545
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:11,220
Speaker 1: How do I do things with that?

546
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,410
Speaker 1: Because I mean the switches it's just binary numbers.

547
00:38:15,038 --> 00:38:21,329
Speaker 1: So say, you know Say you want to add two binary numbers or subtract two or do something to the binary numbers to get some answer out.

548
00:38:22,611 --> 00:38:28,370
Speaker 1: It seems like it'd be really complicated to make a different combination of switches for every possible input.

549
00:38:29,118 --> 00:38:41,287
Speaker 1: No, you don't have to yep The fact that turns out that there is a very small set of logical operators in binary That together can be used to make any logical situation you can describe in binary.

550
00:38:41,307 --> 00:38:44,809
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I don't know if we're gonna talk about them in great detail tonight.

551
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,278
Speaker 1: probably not but very briefly.

552
00:38:47,298 --> 00:39:08,110
Speaker 1: and if you want to get ahead of us and Nand or X or not You can also combine them to be like not X or or Nor and if you keep combining them you get very complex circuits that can do things like addition and subtraction and primary factorization.

553
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:12,185
Speaker 0: Yep now for the.

554
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,318
Speaker 0: We're gonna finish it off right here.

555
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:16,090
Speaker 1: I think we should wrap it up a little bit.

556
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:21,474
Speaker 1: I don't want to go too long the first time because I'd really like to get some feedback from all our listeners on is They understood it.

557
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:22,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, is the pace?

558
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:23,304
Speaker 1: Okay, should we speed up?

559
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:24,169
Speaker 1: Should we slow down?

560
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:25,860
Speaker 1: Is that too much for one day?

561
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,269
Speaker 0: All right, so here's the final example I want you to put in your minds and then I'm gonna have a mini trivia question.

562
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:34,526
Speaker 1: Oh a trivia question just a little mini one to kind of keep people interested.

563
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:35,009
Speaker 0: Okay?

564
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,876
Speaker 0: Imagine this in your minds.

565
00:39:38,257 --> 00:39:40,705
Speaker 0: There are four light bulbs doo-doo.

566
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:42,350
Speaker 0: No forget the four light bulbs.

567
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:58,158
Speaker 0: there's a calculator screen right and the calculator screen has four wires going into it, right and What the calculator screen will do is if all ones come into it on Each of the four wires.

568
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:03,044
Speaker 0: if there's electricity in all four wires then the letter F will appear on the calculator screen.

569
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:04,028
Speaker 0: you see where I'm going.

570
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:09,608
Speaker 0: and If there's no electricity in none of the wires, then the number zero will go there.

571
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:13,442
Speaker 0: Now the four wires aren't just going to four switches.

572
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:15,450
Speaker 0: You can make any number you want appear.

573
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:25,368
Speaker 0: they're going into two separate sets of switches and You see you set one set of switches to be one number and the other set of switches to be another number.

574
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:38,083
Speaker 0: and then there's a bunch of those ands and nans and stuff in between that we talked about and It adds the first number you put together And the second number you put together and the result shows up on the screen.

575
00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:40,290
Speaker 1: now note that there's only four wires.

576
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:43,600
Speaker 1: Then you're limited to F. It's the highest number you can reach.

577
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:48,463
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you try to add seven and a No, not gonna work.

578
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:53,849
Speaker 1: and Depending on how I mean if you just have the circuit there It'll work and it'll give you an answer.

579
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:58,458
Speaker 1: but it'll give you the wrong answer because it's like imagine if you were doing a an addition.

580
00:40:58,518 --> 00:41:05,930
Speaker 1: right you're adding a bunch of numbers together and Say you only have eight spaces on your little piece of paper for the answer, but the answer uses nine digits.

581
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:09,142
Speaker 1: You just chop off the one on the end and now your answer is totally wrong.

582
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:11,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, the idea is you don't put more input.

583
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:17,808
Speaker 0: You don't give the per the user enough input to overflow yeah and on a hardware level you make you just.

584
00:41:17,868 --> 00:41:19,936
Speaker 1: you know You know that all right.

585
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:23,570
Speaker 1: I have X wires, so I can't ever do anything that needs more than X wires.

586
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:24,732
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

587
00:41:24,993 --> 00:41:29,710
Speaker 1: of course you can do fancy things like well say I have two sets of X wires or four sets X wires.

588
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:31,196
Speaker 1: I'll use two of those sets now.

589
00:41:31,236 --> 00:41:34,490
Speaker 1: I can store twice as much, but now I'm using two of my sets.

590
00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:35,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it would probably be.

591
00:41:35,817 --> 00:41:51,870
Speaker 0: there are four wires going into the display But there are three wires on the left and three wires on the right, so if you turn them all on it would be Seven and seven which is 14. if you turn them if you turn one side off it would be seven.

592
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:56,800
Speaker 1: So I hope this is enlighten any people a little bit.

593
00:41:56,861 --> 00:42:00,652
Speaker 1: We really want to get a lot of feedback And we'll try to fine-tune this series as we go on.

594
00:42:00,713 --> 00:42:02,160
Speaker 1: since this is the inaugural episode.

595
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:05,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, next time we'll probably talk about the actual gates.

596
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:11,960
Speaker 0: Yeah digital logic and Then we'll probably make a big jump over a bunch of really complicated stuff.

597
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:20,731
Speaker 0: That's in between But we'll try to abstract it so you can make the connection all the way up to where the assembly Programming is which is what you got to jump to.

598
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:28,738
Speaker 1: plus we can always go back once We've gone over larger broader ideas and fill in very specific details, especially if people are curious about them.

599
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:38,620
Speaker 1: yep Yep now my trivia, and this is I think every time we do this I'll have a trivia that's basically going to be answered in the next episode regardless of whether any you figure it out.

600
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:40,059
Speaker 0: Are you gonna give a prize?

601
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,186
Speaker 1: No, no prize.

602
00:42:41,247 --> 00:42:42,360
Speaker 1: This is just for your own.

603
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,505
Speaker 1: This is the kind of thing where if you go out and find the answer You'll be ahead of the game.

604
00:42:46,546 --> 00:42:48,374
Speaker 1: You'll have a better idea of what we're talking about.

605
00:42:48,414 --> 00:42:52,814
Speaker 1: on the next one okay now I mentioned all those gates you know and or X or NAND and not.

606
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,080
Speaker 0: oh, this is a good one.

607
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:55,083
Speaker 0: Why are we gonna ask?

608
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:57,412
Speaker 1: I think you do know what I'm gonna ask now.

609
00:42:58,134 --> 00:43:01,485
Speaker 1: each one of them can be made With or without a transistor.

610
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:06,140
Speaker 1: you can make all of those gates with just wires and switches.

611
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:08,530
Speaker 1: You can also make them with transistors.

612
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:25,860
Speaker 1: now of all of them one of them is electrically the simplest to make and the most versatile and It is the one that you can with this logical operator make by combinations of certain numbers of this operator any other one of the operators.

613
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:33,661
Speaker 1: Now most chips that people buy especially hobbyist known RadioShack you buy like a little IC chip that you stick in a board and fiddle With.

614
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:37,836
Speaker 0: yeah, it's one of those black rectangles all little bits coming out of it on the sides.

615
00:43:37,896 --> 00:43:38,699
Speaker 0: It looks like a little bug.

616
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:41,426
Speaker 0: Those actually have a shit ton of gates in them.

617
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:41,787
Speaker 0: yep

618
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:58,880
Speaker 1: now the thing is most of those chips only include one gate and in fact most simple chips out in the world are comprised entirely of one and only one kind of gate and They combine that one kind of gate to make all the different gates because it's easier electronically to do that.

619
00:43:59,582 --> 00:44:02,970
Speaker 1: So my question is what is that universal gate that everyone uses?

620
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:03,632
Speaker 1: which one?

621
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:06,359
Speaker 1: and NAND not X or or?

622
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:15,337
Speaker 0: Yep, they're or or Only the simplest electronics that are out there use you know all the different kinds of gates.

623
00:44:15,538 --> 00:44:24,687
Speaker 0: all the complex electronics in the world use One gate only one gate because you have so many gates at that point It's more efficient now.

624
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:24,868
Speaker 1: now.

625
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:30,370
Speaker 1: We may be wrong about some of the crazy new processors Because people do some interesting things with electricity nowadays.

626
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,072
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do.

627
00:44:31,273 --> 00:44:33,118
Speaker 1: these are things you don't need to care about mm-hmm.

628
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:58,148
Speaker 1: but anyway That is my question and really give us some feedback on this because we'll try to go in whatever direction you guys want and cater To whatever you want to learn Mm-hmm and maybe our ideal sue us for giving it away for free Haha, and that was geek nights with rim and Scott special.

629
00:44:58,188 --> 00:45:00,210

635
00:45:23,812 --> 00:45:29,306
Speaker 0: Geek nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience, but unlike those other talk shows.

636
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:30,930
Speaker 0: It's actually recorded at night.
