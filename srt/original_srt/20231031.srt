1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,000
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:11,708
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, October 31st, 2023.

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,009
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:16,540
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,202
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Knights.

6
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:28,660
Speaker 1: Tonight, on the 18th anniversary of us starting this fucking podcast, we are going to review Jackbox Party Pack #10.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,658
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:32,079
Speaker 0: We're eight years older than them.

9
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:35,575
Speaker 1: We are older than a lot of things.

10
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:36,320
Speaker 1: We're older than Twitter.

11
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:38,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, for sure.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:01:06,300
Speaker 1: Many podcasts have risen and fallen, empires, entire countries have appeared and disappeared, depending on whether or not other countries recognize them, yet Geek Knights, somehow, 18 years, and while we recorded our first For Real episode on October 31st, 2005, that was after a couple months of us recording all those beta episodes that are just up on the Patreon for free.

13
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:15,500
Speaker 1: With commentary and remastered, if anyone wants to hear the episodes of Geek Knights so early that we were not comfortable even putting them on the internet.

14
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, now we have a live streaming video, which we attempted to do with Ustream in who knows what year.

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,781
Speaker 0: I remember,

16
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:43,140
Speaker 1: we got to have a copy of it somewhere, because I got stuck in a tornado that messed up the sawmill, so I got home late, and then we recorded that live thing, like we live streamed on Ustream with that fucking construction light, like sitting in the center, like I was worried it was going to melt the carpet or something.

17
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:51,640
Speaker 1: We recorded like an hour and 45 minutes of just us doing live chat, but I remember also, not many people even could live stream back then.

18
00:01:52,181 --> 00:02:04,960
Speaker 1: So at some point during our stream, I want to say we got promoted to the front page of Ustream, and then a ton of randos came in, and they're all horrible, and then they slowly left as they realized it was just two nerds talking.

19
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was no moderation then.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,121
Speaker 1: Yep.

21
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:11,839
Speaker 1: That was a long time ago.

22
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:21,680
Speaker 0: Well, since it's Halloween, and I didn't get to use my very inexpensive Halloween costume, so I got five more minutes of use out of it.

23
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,391
Speaker 1: It's a good costume.

24
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:24,220
Speaker 1: It's versatile.

25
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:35,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I bought, I don't know if I talked about this last year, but I bought this skeleton body, and the skeleton head was pretty cheap, but it's pretty good.

26
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,900
Speaker 0: It's not a bad skeleton head.

27
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:40,523
Speaker 0: But the body was not cheap, right?

28
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:46,873
Speaker 0: So it's like just every year, I can just add a different skeleton variety, right?

29
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:51,040
Speaker 0: So last year I was skeleton pirate, and this year I'm skeleton king.

30
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,639
Speaker 0: You could be skeleton anything.

31
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,420
Speaker 0: A crown for five bucks, and a cape for five bucks, it's like, you know, right?

32
00:02:57,883 --> 00:03:00,540
Speaker 1: Take a page from Vinci, be skeleton skeleton.

33
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:03,339
Speaker 0: Ooh, skeleton skeleton.

34
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:12,056
Speaker 0: You know, as long as I get my ten dollars worth of use, you know, and then this, I'm going to use every year forever, right?

35
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:14,000
Speaker 0: So I'll get value out of that, and then I'm good.

36
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,120
Speaker 0: And maybe if I wait long enough, maybe I'll be skeleton king again someday.

37
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:35,140
Speaker 1: I have a really crappy Star Trek uniform costume that is below the line of quality that I will probably ever use again, so I'm actually going to invest in getting a better Star Trek costume, because that might be useful in a lot of parts of my life.

38
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:40,840
Speaker 0: Well, before news, I've got to take this off, because it's not going to work.

39
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:47,040
Speaker 1: I'm going to put a chapter note in the show for pre- and post-Skeleton Scott.

40
00:03:48,140 --> 00:04:04,840
Speaker 1: But anyway, in the news, so this is, Overwatch is making a bunch of changes, and you know, all modern competitive video games make changes a lot, like Marvel Snap has changes, Overwatch has changes, Counter-Strike 2 already has changes, and that's just the way of the world.

41
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:05,757
Speaker 0: About all of them.

42
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:14,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyone who is playing a game, there's always a whole bunch of conversation, and people are pro and anti-scub around.

43
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:23,820
Speaker 1: whatever changes they made, like every little micro-community around every game has the, "Oh, the Nerf Scout dropped, they nerfed my favorite character, I'm mad about it in some

44
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,060
Speaker 1: fashion.".

45
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:49,220
Speaker 1: But I gotta say, of all the games I have ever played that were seriously competitive, and that I cared about, that had ongoing changes like this, Overwatch has consistently, for any other problems that game has had, had the most detailed developer explanations of their changes of any of these games.

46
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,893
Speaker 1: Marvel Snap is a not-too-distant second.

47
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,119
Speaker 1: Marvel Snap does a good job, too.

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:13,494
Speaker 0: They do sort of explain their logic, which is, you know, and it's like, you know, it's like, sure, okay, explaining your logic about balance changes, but it's like, I wanna see companies in general, any organization, right, that, or even people, right, just individual human beings, if you make a decision that affects

49
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:14,075
Speaker 1: other

50
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:21,500
Speaker 0: people, right, you might make a decision that harms other people, you might make a decision that helps and benefits other people, right?

51
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:33,256
Speaker 0: But if you make a decision that affects others, especially when they had no input, right, it's not a democratic decision, right, when it was a- Like you're someone's boss and you're like, "You have to come in on

52
00:05:33,337 --> 00:05:33,760
Speaker 0: Saturday.".

53
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:34,361
Speaker 0: Right.

54
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,806
Speaker 0: You made an autocratic decision, right?

55
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:44,720
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, obviously, A, I would rather have democratic decisions than autocratic ones, and good ones rather than bad ones.

56
00:05:44,860 --> 00:06:03,600
Speaker 0: But if you're going to make such a decision and it's gonna happen, at the very least, even if I strongly disagree with it in every conceivable way, if you give an honest explanation of your reasoning, no matter how much I might disagree with that reasoning, right?

57
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:15,360
Speaker 0: I will actually respect that more, right, I might not, you know, than somebody who makes a better decision but refuses to explain themselves.

58
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:23,319
Speaker 1: Or someone who makes a bad decision and gives a clearly bad faith, not actually the reason they made that decision.

59
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:23,800
Speaker 1: explanation.

60
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,581
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

61
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:27,187
Speaker 0: It's like, if you come out and say, "I support this housing

62
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:27,729
Speaker 0: policy."

63
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:28,029
Speaker 0: Why?

64
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:29,212
Speaker 0: Because I'm racist.

65
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:32,680
Speaker 0: It's like, well, obviously, I couldn't disagree with you more strongly.

66
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,599
Speaker 1: You suck, my middle finger is up, but at least you told me what you are.

67
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,863
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, but you know what?

68
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:45,937
Speaker 0: It's like, I can't really, I don't have any further thing to say besides go fuck yourself, racist guy, right?

69
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:47,140
Speaker 0: It's like, that's the end of it.

70
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:55,357
Speaker 0: Whereas if somebody's like, "Yeah, we've decided to take away five vacation days from everyone and make you go back to the

71
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:55,778
Speaker 0: office."

72
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:56,700
Speaker 0: Well, why?

73
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,039
Speaker 0: That's all we're going to say.

74
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,309
Speaker 1: Now imagine the company says, "Look, we're barely breaking

75
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:03,610
Speaker 1: even.".

76
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,997
Speaker 0: We decided no pride tape on the hockey sticks.

77
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:06,298
Speaker 0: Why?

78
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,303
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, did the NHS answer?

79
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:08,845
Speaker 1: Silence.

80
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:10,090
Speaker 0: No comment.

81
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,535
Speaker 0: We decided to allow it again.

82
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:11,956
Speaker 0: Why?

83
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:12,940
Speaker 0: No comment.

84
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:17,836
Speaker 1: I have decided, anytime there is no comment, the answer is, "Because I am a

85
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:18,358
Speaker 1: coward.".

86
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:19,623
Speaker 0: That's right.

87
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:24,020
Speaker 0: That's the fill-in-the-blank answer, is because you're a spineless coward.

88
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:32,354
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I always think back to that famous '70s IBM presentation quote, "A computer can never be held accountable.

89
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:35,020
Speaker 1: Therefore, a computer must never make a management

90
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,260
Speaker 1: decision.".

91
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:51,720
Speaker 1: Because there are a lot of, not computers, but bureaucracies, institutions, any group of more than one person also makes collective decisions that may not necessarily be the result of any one individual's primary input.

92
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:56,551
Speaker 1: And therefore, unless that body can be held accountable, it really shouldn't be making decisions either.

93
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,160
Speaker 1: But also, that body should explain why it made a decision.

94
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,582
Speaker 1: So an example here.

95
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,623
Speaker 1: So Overwatch.

96
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:09,371
Speaker 1: D.Va, the tank I play, the gamer girl from Korea.

97
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:13,516
Speaker 1: Movement speed penalty reduced from 40 to 30 percent when using fusion cannons.

98
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,799
Speaker 1: Micro missile projectile speed increased 40 to 50 percent.

99
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:20,916
Speaker 0: So that means if you use a fusion cannon, you don't get slowed down.

100
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:21,920
Speaker 0: You can keep going fast.

101
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,463
Speaker 1: Well, you still get slowed down.

102
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:26,109
Speaker 1: You get slowed down less, because her deal is her main weapon.

103
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,612
Speaker 1: You can just fire it forever.

104
00:08:27,652 --> 00:08:30,840
Speaker 1: It has unlimited ammo and just fires forever if you're holding that button down.

105
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,458
Speaker 0: But when you fire it, you slow down.

106
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,357
Speaker 1: You slow down a little bit.

107
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:35,220
Speaker 0: But you slow down less than you did before.

108
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:36,874
Speaker 1: Yes, but by 10 percent, a tiny amount.

109
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:39,979
Speaker 0: So you're not going to get hosed.

110
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,164
Speaker 1: And similarly, micro missiles.

111
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:48,440
Speaker 1: So you have a secondary attack you can only use every n seconds, where you shoot basically in a tonneau circus straight ahead at someone.

112
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:49,400
Speaker 0: Okay.

113
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,640
Speaker 1: So they made them slightly faster.

114
00:08:52,821 --> 00:09:06,260
Speaker 1: The added projectile speed to micro missiles helps improve their consistency at medium range, while the decreased movement speed penalty on fusion cannons enables D.Va to stay closer to mobile targets, making her more of a threat when diving into the enemy team.

115
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,706
Speaker 1: So they don't just tell you why they made the change.

116
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:13,780
Speaker 1: They tell you, hey, this is how the change will affect you, serious players.

117
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:15,448
Speaker 1: If you're a D.Va diver, you'll be better at it.

118
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,239
Speaker 1: If D.Va dives into your team, D.Va is more dangerous than she was before.

119
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:25,880
Speaker 1: And they give very detailed updates.

120
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,460
Speaker 1: But I kind of just wanted to talk about it as an excuse for, I've been doing an experiment for a few months.

121
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:32,168
Speaker 1: I play Overwatch a lot.

122
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,980
Speaker 1: It's my current lifestyle game.

123
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,140
Speaker 1: And I have a rule of only having one primary lifestyle game at a time.

124
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,340
Speaker 1: So I only play a little bit of Counter-Strike.

125
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,537
Speaker 1: And I've been trying, earnestly.

126
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:45,420
Speaker 1: I tried to make a team, but it's just, I can't schedule my life around a video game.

127
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,940
Speaker 1: Like, I can barely schedule my life around good guys.

128
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,900
Speaker 0: That doesn't sound like you're really, you just contradicted yourself.

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,473
Speaker 0: You said, yeah, it's my lifestyle game.

130
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:53,279
Speaker 0: It's like, no, it's not.

131
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,740
Speaker 0: If it's your lifestyle game, you're scheduling around it, right?

132
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,349
Speaker 1: No, I didn't say it's my lifestyle game.

133
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,960
Speaker 1: I said it is a lifestyle game.

134
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:02,859
Speaker 1: And I only play one lifestyle game a lot at a time.

135
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,519
Speaker 0: Well, it's not a lifestyle game for you if you're not scheduling around it.

136
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,300
Speaker 1: It's not a lifestyle thing for me except, I don't know, eating good food, wandering around New York, riding my bike.

137
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,960
Speaker 1: But I have been trying to get good at the game as an individual specifically.

138
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,105
Speaker 1: Because that is easy.

139
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:25,538
Speaker 1: I can play a game and then watch the replay and take notes on, well, what went poorly.

140
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,520
Speaker 1: I can watch the replay again from the perspective of the player who is fucking me up to figure out what were they doing.

141
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:33,439
Speaker 1: What could I have done to avoid that?

142
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,580
Speaker 1: Chatting with my team, taking notes, looking at stats.

143
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:37,682
Speaker 1: And you know what?

144
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:49,120
Speaker 1: For all the people who say that the matchmaking in games like Overwatch, even a team-based game, is cruel to them and they can never get out of bronze because their teammates always suck.

145
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:59,620
Speaker 1: Now, even playing literally nothing but solo rando queue, only playing with randos, complete randos, no input over who's on my team.

146
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:03,600
Speaker 1: I have been steadily and consistently rising through the ranks.

147
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:13,740
Speaker 1: And this only began when I started analyzing my own play, watching replays, and making active decisions about what will I do differently next time.

148
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:17,594
Speaker 0: I mean, effort and practice works.

149
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:18,699
Speaker 0: News at 11, I don't know.

150
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:23,460
Speaker 1: But remember, a lot of people mistake effort for practice.

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,560
Speaker 1: Or they mistake time spent playing a game for effort spent trying to get better at a game.

152
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's the right answer.

153
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:38,280
Speaker 1: Like someone who uses an exercise bike all the time at zero resistance.

154
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,320
Speaker 1: That is not a material workout compared to even slightly more resistance.

155
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,789
Speaker 1: But they might think, "But I use the bike eight hours a day, I should be super strong by

156
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:46,950
Speaker 1: now.".

157
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:49,679
Speaker 0: That's true.

158
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,880
Speaker 1: So yeah, you got some news?

159
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:56,040
Speaker 0: I mean, there probably is a bunch of gaming news, but whatever.

160
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:05,280
Speaker 0: I went back and this year, Nintendo has this voucher program where basically you can buy vouchers for games.

161
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,860
Speaker 0: Basically, you're promising Nintendo that you'll buy two games because you get two vouchers.

162
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,214
Speaker 0: And the vouchers cost what, like 50 bucks each?

163
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:14,159
Speaker 0: 45, something like that?

164
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,586
Speaker 0: Yeah.

165
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,099
Speaker 0: And you can use them to get basically any game.

166
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:20,977
Speaker 0: So the top tier games are always 60 bucks.

167
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,140
Speaker 0: So basically, Nintendo gets your money early.

168
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:29,940
Speaker 0: And if you fail to use the vouchers within the year, you just gave them free money, you dumbass.

169
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:34,660
Speaker 0: But as long as you get two games that are top tier games.

170
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,699
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess if you're a fool and you use them on a cheap game, they get your money.

171
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:44,780
Speaker 0: But as long as you use them on top tier games, you save money.

172
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:47,699
Speaker 0: So it's like, are you gonna get two Nintendo games this year?

173
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,100
Speaker 0: As long as you release two Nintendo games this year, then yes, yes I am.

174
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,400
Speaker 0: So the two games of the year were, of course, Tears of the Kingdom and Mario Wonder.

175
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,938
Speaker 0: So Mario Wonder just came out.

176
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,899
Speaker 1: I have not touched it yet because Emily's out of town and Emily took the Switch with her.

177
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,208
Speaker 0: No, I played it through a world or two.

178
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:14,320
Speaker 0: And basically what's going on in this game is it's a lot like other recent Mario games.

179
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,179
Speaker 0: Where, you know, you basically, there's a world map.

180
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:22,120
Speaker 0: In each level you can collect, in previous games it was like big coins.

181
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,820
Speaker 0: Like you're trying to find the big coins in the level, right?

182
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,858
Speaker 0: And there'd be like three per level or something like that.

183
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:31,899
Speaker 0: And in this one, it's like these wonder seeds.

184
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:35,900
Speaker 0: So basically you get a wonder seed for hitting the flagpole no matter what in every level.

185
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:37,800
Speaker 0: So if you just beat the level, you get a wonder seed.

186
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,200
Speaker 0: And then there may be more wonder seeds hidden in the level somewhere.

187
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,700
Speaker 0: Of somewhat more or less difficulty to obtain or find, right?

188
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,380
Speaker 0: And then if you get enough seeds, you can open up areas on the world map and continue with the game.

189
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:56,400
Speaker 0: You can basically beat the game with like the minimum number of seeds.

190
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,879
Speaker 0: Like, you really can't fail.

191
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,040
Speaker 1: That's been the pattern for Mario games.

192
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:05,720
Speaker 1: And actually there's a lot of Nintendo first party games in general for a long time.

193
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:06,482
Speaker 0: Yep.

194
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:12,840
Speaker 0: They also, when you choose characters, you can choose Mario, Luigi, Princess Toad, Daisy, et cetera, right?

195
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,779
Speaker 0: And play the game normally.

196
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,500
Speaker 0: Or you can pick Yoshi or one of this other, I guess, I don't know if it's a rabbit.

197
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:19,516
Speaker 0: I don't know who the guy is.

198
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:23,179
Speaker 0: I think he's related to raving or I don't know what the hell he is.

199
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:29,800
Speaker 0: But if you choose them, it's sort of like you don't get to do the transformations like into elephants and stuff.

200
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,339
Speaker 0: But you're sort of invincible, can't die.

201
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,419
Speaker 0: So it's like playing the game on easy mode.

202
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:38,560
Speaker 0: If you're having trouble, you can beat the game with Yoshi or whatever.

203
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,458
Speaker 0: No matter what.

204
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,757
Speaker 0: So that's a thing.

205
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:50,080
Speaker 0: And otherwise, it's like they removed the timer on the levels.

206
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,820
Speaker 0: So every Mario game I've ever played, 2D ones, there's some kind of timer in each level.

207
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,660
Speaker 0: And if you don't beat the level fast enough, you die.

208
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:59,440
Speaker 0: In this one, there's no timer.

209
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,260
Speaker 0: You can just hang out in the level all fucking day.

210
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:03,499
Speaker 0: And there's some things you can do.

211
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:12,180
Speaker 0: For example, I figured out with the elephant, if you stand near like a certain flower or a pipe or something and you swing the elephant trunk, it sprays water.

212
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:13,859
Speaker 0: You get like one coin.

213
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:20,838
Speaker 0: You can actually sit there if you want to spend 100 seconds of your life and get a one up by getting 100 coins.

214
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:25,620
Speaker 0: And it's infinite lives, theoretically, because there's no timer.

215
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,079
Speaker 0: I didn't do that.

216
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,910
Speaker 0: But what if I had 99 coins?

217
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, I picked up one coin, right?

218
00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:38,620
Speaker 0: And so there are, however, still lives and game overs.

219
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:43,540
Speaker 0: So if you run out of lives, you basically get kicked out of the level.

220
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,420
Speaker 0: And you have to go on the world map, it sends you back.

221
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,494
Speaker 0: But being sent back on the world map doesn't hurt you at all.

222
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:55,178
Speaker 0: You just walk back to where you were.

223
00:15:56,441 --> 00:16:02,660
Speaker 1: That's kind of like those early Wario games where you don't die, you just fall down a hole and now you gotta do it again.

224
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,260
Speaker 0: Wario's whole thing, since Wario 2, is that he can't die, period.

225
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:19,060
Speaker 0: But here, it's like, you can run out of lives, and if you get game over, there's another currency that you use in the shops, and you lose some of that currency.

226
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Speaker 0: But, when you get sent back, this temporary special bonus round opens, and you can go in there, and if you go in there, you actually recover more currency than you lost.

227
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:35,540
Speaker 0: And you get a bunch of lives back, just for game over, to start over again.

228
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:42,480
Speaker 1: I feel like the lives are almost now just this fiction that doesn't even need to be there anymore.

229
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,280
Speaker 1: They only exist because of the history of video games, and this is one last recursion.

230
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, why even have the lives?

231
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,960
Speaker 0: It's like, just don't have the lives, right?

232
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,497
Speaker 0: The challenge of the game is, even if you can't die, can you find the seeds?

233
00:16:58,597 --> 00:16:59,580
Speaker 0: Can you obtain them?

234
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:10,020
Speaker 0: Because some of the seeds, right, A, are really well hidden, depending on the difficulty of the level, and B, some of them are difficult to obtain, even if you do find them.

235
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,760
Speaker 0: Sometimes there's a time limit to get them and such like that.

236
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:25,780
Speaker 0: So, it is interesting how much they went out of their way to make the game guaranteed you're going to beat it, without completely getting rid of lives, but sort of effectively getting rid of them.

237
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:33,548
Speaker 1: It's interesting, because on one hand, there are definitely people, a lot of people, not even just kids, who get

238
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:34,849
Speaker 0: unduly

239
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:45,740
Speaker 1: bent out of shape if they feel like they can't beat a game, even if beating it is effectively the equivalent of beating the first boss in a modern Metroidvania game and thinking that was the whole game.

240
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:51,420
Speaker 1: They need to be told they beat it, or they will be extremely angry.

241
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:58,838
Speaker 1: But then there's people who want to fully experience the game and do the upside down castle, and then there's the people who want to 100% the game.

242
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:13,260
Speaker 1: And I think Nintendo, especially with the Mario games, has done an amazing job of accommodating all three of those types of people in games, naturally, without them knowing they're being accommodated, without them picking a difficulty.

243
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,920
Speaker 1: But I do feel like this is the last Mario game that has the concept of lives.

244
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:35,240
Speaker 0: It could be, but regardless, it's like, well, we talked about how this game is basically not a challenge the way old Mario games were, but actually, this game is still really great, because, like I said, there is a challenge, some levels are challenging.

245
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,846
Speaker 0: There's a level where there's a stampede.

246
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:40,011
Speaker 0: It's like a really fast autoscroller, actually.

247
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:41,074
Speaker 0: It's pretty tough.

248
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:48,479
Speaker 0: And to get the seeds in there, that's a three star difficult level, right?

249
00:18:49,721 --> 00:19:00,420
Speaker 0: But it's still way fun to go around the levels, try to figure out, find hidden stuff, interact with all sorts of different interesting bad guys and interactions.

250
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:07,993
Speaker 0: There's a lot going on in this game, and it is enjoyable, quite a bit, but is it $60?

251
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:08,834
Speaker 0: Enjoyable, right?

252
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,050
Speaker 0: And if you say the Tears of the Kingdom is $60, it's like...

253
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:22,940
Speaker 1: I mean, by that logic, I don't think any $60 game on Earth is worth what Tears of the Kingdom was worth.

254
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:36,680
Speaker 1: Tears of the Kingdom is, it's too soon to say this, but it is, in my opinion, probably the best Zelda franchise game ever made to this point.

255
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,002
Speaker 0: Probably.

256
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,449
Speaker 0: But it might be the best single player video game ever made.

257
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:47,300
Speaker 0: But the point is, is that if you bought vouchers, and what else are you going to use your second voucher on?

258
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,044
Speaker 0: It's like, this is probably the game.

259
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:54,580
Speaker 0: But unless there's some older Switch game, you don't already have, for some reason.

260
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:04,616
Speaker 0: But if you're going to spend $60, I would wait a while for this to be in a discounted state, like a year or so.

261
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:07,020
Speaker 0: You can get it maybe for $40 or something, who knows?

262
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,895
Speaker 0: But that doesn't mean, I don't have a criticism of it, other than just set your expectation that this isn't going to be Mario 3 or a difficult Mario game.

263
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,567
Speaker 0: This is going to be more like a Kirby game in terms of, you can just beat it.

264
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:36,060
Speaker 0: But if you decide that you want to get every single seed, which I probably will eventually, then there will be some challenge to it, even though the challenge doesn't come in the form of lives and game overs.

265
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,654
Speaker 1: I still gotta go back and get most of the things in Mario Odyssey.

266
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:42,580
Speaker 1: I beat it and I got a lot, but I didn't get everything.

267
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:48,363
Speaker 1: One last little news.

268
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:52,531
Speaker 1: So, Deltarune, which is eagerly anticipated.

269
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:57,400
Speaker 1: When it comes out, I'm just going to play the rest of it pretty much immediately and drop everything else.

270
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:05,896
Speaker 1: But originally, Deltarune 1 and 2 are two distinct games that are in chronological order, and they're free.

271
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:06,738
Speaker 1: You can just play them.

272
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:07,620
Speaker 1: Just get them and play them.

273
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:17,997
Speaker 1: The rest of Deltarune, 3, 4, and 5, the original plan was that if you buy Deltarune for dollars, you get the remaining three chapters.

274
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:19,540
Speaker 1: Now you have all five chapters.

275
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:20,820
Speaker 0: Oh, I see.

276
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:24,405
Speaker 0: So basically, it's sort of like, hey, play my free 1 and 2 games.

277
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:28,611
Speaker 0: But if you give me money now, because I need money now, not later.

278
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:31,194
Speaker 0: I need money to make more games.

279
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:35,460
Speaker 0: I can't make more games without getting money first.

280
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:37,325
Speaker 1: So originally, 3, 4, and 5.

281
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:39,812
Speaker 0: I'll give you the future games for your money now.

282
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,780
Speaker 0: I'll give you a game tomorrow for a dollar today.

283
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,111
Speaker 1: So they were going to wait for 3, 4, and 5 to be done, and then release them all simultaneously with that package.

284
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:53,520
Speaker 1: So you basically get the entire rest of Deltarune all at once and you just go crazy on it.

285
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:14,200
Speaker 1: But announced a little while ago today, like less than an hour ago as of when we're recording Geek Nights, Toby Fox gave an update for Halloween and said that now, in the interest of getting the game in front of people faster, chapters 3 and 4 are going to be released together before 5 is ready.

286
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:20,209
Speaker 1: So we'll be able to play most of Deltarune much sooner than we originally anticipated.

287
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:24,676
Speaker 1: There's no date for when it'll come out yet, but it should be relatively soon.

288
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:26,579
Speaker 1: Because 3 is done.

289
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,248
Speaker 0: What if somebody never heard of these games before?

290
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:32,100
Speaker 0: Could they then pay the one fee and get all the full set?

291
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,936
Speaker 1: Yes, the one fee is still just for all 5 chapters, and you can still at any point play chapters 1 and 2 from nothing.

292
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:41,840
Speaker 1: You can just play them for free anywhere.

293
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:48,709
Speaker 0: So you can think of it more like a game where 20% of the game is free and the remaining 80% of the game is, well no, 40% of the game, no, fifths.

294
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, two fifths are free.

295
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:58,818
Speaker 0: Two fifths are free of the game.

296
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:13,418
Speaker 1: It'll cost one chunk of money, and two fifths of the remaining three fifths will come out together relatively soon, and then probably there'll be some horrible cliffhanger, and you're going to be really, really upset, Escaflowne style, waiting for 5 to come out.

297
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,940
Speaker 1: That's just how these games will go.

298
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:22,516
Speaker 1: I would highly recommend, if you've never played Deltarune, and if you've never played Undertale, just play Deltarune 1 and 2.

299
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:23,117
Speaker 1: They're free.

300
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:24,180
Speaker 1: They're short.

301
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:38,220
Speaker 1: In fact, 1 is really short, and unlike Undertale, which I think is a very good game, Deltarune does not have the same level of shmup skill gate, and it is more entertainment software.

302
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,420
Speaker 1: More people can beat it without getting stuck at the first skeleton boss like Scott and a few of our friends did.

303
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,044
Speaker 0: I just didn't realize.

304
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:57,659
Speaker 0: The skeleton boss beat me, and I was like, "Huh, maybe this is one of those bosses where there's no way you can beat it, and there's another way to

305
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:57,880
Speaker 0: go.".

306
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,172
Speaker 0: And I just walked around everywhere else, seeing if there was another way to go, and there wasn't, and I was like, "Huh.

307
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:05,316
Speaker 0: F this game, and it's bad design.

308
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:06,619
Speaker 0: I can't figure out where I'm supposed to go

309
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:06,880
Speaker 0: next.".

310
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:07,725
Speaker 1: It's just a shmup.

311
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:09,517
Speaker 1: You just gotta shmup at the skeleton.

312
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:10,040
Speaker 1: He's not even that hard.

313
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,534
Speaker 0: I just didn't realize that I was supposed to actually beat that guy.

314
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:14,980
Speaker 0: I thought it was one of those, you know...

315
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,160
Speaker 1: But you didn't have this concern when you murdered Toriel.

316
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:20,478
Speaker 0: I don't remember what the hell I did.

317
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,320
Speaker 1: You murdered your surrogate mother.

318
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:27,853
Speaker 0: I also thought it was strange that, you know, I played the game, you know, it didn't take that long.

319
00:24:27,873 --> 00:24:33,497
Speaker 0: That's very early in the game that I... At least I think it's very early in the game that I stopped playing.

320
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:35,312
Speaker 1: What I'd say is if Undertale was...

321
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:46,440
Speaker 0: The point is that, you know, the information I had about that game before playing it is that people were very, very emotionally tied up in what was going on in that game.

322
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,880
Speaker 1: I'm very emotionally tied up in what's going on in that game.

323
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,712
Speaker 0: And at the point that I bailed out of that game, I didn't give a fuck.

324
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:56,980
Speaker 0: It touched me absolutely nowhere.

325
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,065
Speaker 0: I was like, "What is up with this stupid shit?

326
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:03,655
Speaker 0: This reminds me of fucking... What's that fucking weird webcomic thing?

327
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:05,439
Speaker 0: All the kids with the gray face

328
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:05,720
Speaker 0: paint?".

329
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,197
Speaker 1: Homestuck?

330
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, it reminded me of Homestuck and I was like, "I don't give a shit about this.

331
00:25:09,493 --> 00:25:10,638
Speaker 0: Why do people like it so

332
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:10,900
Speaker 0: much?".

333
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,759
Speaker 1: So total aside, when I went to a train transit advocate meetup with Emily...

334
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:16,620
Speaker 0: It was a Homestuck first?

335
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,080
Speaker 1: A couple weekends ago it was the normal people.

336
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:27,680
Speaker 1: These are the people where they had shirts that were just diagrams of particular subway exchanges around the city.

337
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,120
Speaker 1: And they were playing a game of guessing what everyone's shirt was just from the diagram.

338
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:32,439
Speaker 1: And nobody got it wrong.

339
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:36,558
Speaker 1: But randomly Emily's like, "Oh yeah, I work at video

340
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:36,800
Speaker 1: games.".

341
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:37,318
Speaker 1: "Oh, what'd you

342
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:37,380
Speaker 1: do?".

343
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:38,975
Speaker 1: "I worked on the Homestuck

344
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:39,217
Speaker 1: game.".

345
00:25:40,183 --> 00:25:44,139
Speaker 1: And of all the people there, all but one did not react to that word at all.

346
00:25:44,803 --> 00:25:47,960
Speaker 1: And one of them reacted like Emily was a god.

347
00:25:50,024 --> 00:25:51,219
Speaker 1: The dichotomy is strong.

348
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,939
Speaker 0: The point is, I didn't care, so that's why I didn't press on.

349
00:25:56,002 --> 00:26:01,800
Speaker 0: If they had managed to make me care, I would have pressed on harder with more than two attempts to beat the skeleton game.

350
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:16,770
Speaker 1: What I would say to the Scots out there is that Deltarune, from the raw objective perspective of just a game with game design that is intended to be compelling to an arbitrary gamer... Deltarune is better written and better designed.

351
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,620
Speaker 1: It is a better game by all technical accounts.

352
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,240
Speaker 1: Toby learned a lot from Undertale, and Deltarune is just better done.

353
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,030
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day!

354
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,690
Speaker 1: This is a ten second long YouTube video.

355
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,168
Speaker 1: It is titled, all lowercase, "I could probably beat Ramiel in a

356
00:26:42,248 --> 00:26:42,469
Speaker 1: fight.".

357
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:43,299
Speaker 1: And that's it.

358
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:44,190
Speaker 1: That's my thing of the day.

359
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:49,130
Speaker 0: Unless you're a very, very, very, very, very large robot.

360
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:57,030
Speaker 1: Even then, the odds of you beating Ramiel are 0.0000001%.

361
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,430
Speaker 0: It's a tough fight, even for the giant, giant robot.

362
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,723
Speaker 0: And you're a person, so...

363
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:08,570
Speaker 1: I mean, I would say, even if you expand into the realm of classical mythology, like, Zeus might not beat Ramiel in a fight.

364
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:09,669
Speaker 0: Probably not.

365
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:14,990
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to go back to, like, Chronos, and even Chronos might get fucked up by Ramiel.

366
00:27:16,312 --> 00:27:17,007
Speaker 0: I don't know.

367
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:25,170
Speaker 1: Chronos actually would probably be able to beat one of the angels, but I don't think Chronos could beat multiple angels simultaneously.

368
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,310
Speaker 0: Well, I think, you know, angels could beat angels, right?

369
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,410
Speaker 0: So if, like, Azathoth could beat Ramiel.

370
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:31,763
Speaker 0: Yeah.

371
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:39,610
Speaker 1: But yeah, spoiler, I'm not gonna spoil the video, but take a bet on what happens in this video.

372
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,490
Speaker 1: Do you think this person could, in fact, beat Ramiel?

373
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:42,336
Speaker 1: Well, this entity.

374
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:43,850
Speaker 1: Do you think they could beat Ramiel in a fight?

375
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:46,150
Speaker 1: And then in ten seconds, you will find out the answer.

376
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,790
Speaker 0: Listen, they have a middle finger that is a human hand, so... It's in the thumbnail.

377
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:59,910
Speaker 0: Alright, so here's a website, it's a really simple website, called the... And the website implements an algorithm known as the Aronson Oracle.

378
00:28:01,851 --> 00:28:05,970
Speaker 0: And basically, what happens is, on this website, you have two things you can do.

379
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,730
Speaker 0: You can either press the F key on your keyboard, or you can press the D key.

380
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,276
Speaker 1: Oh, I have forced it down to 46%.

381
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:15,550
Speaker 1: It is actually worse at figuring me out.

382
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:16,410
Speaker 0: Okay.

383
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,822
Speaker 0: And you're going to press one of those two keys.

384
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:21,550
Speaker 0: Those are your only options, right?

385
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:31,890
Speaker 0: And the software will then predict which key you are going to press next, F or D. And if it is correct, then it gets points.

386
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:35,690
Speaker 0: And the percentage will go up, because that's the percentage of time it guesses correctly.

387
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:40,070
Speaker 0: And if it guesses wrong, it goes down, because it guessed wrong.

388
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,550
Speaker 0: It didn't know which one you were going to press next.

389
00:28:42,710 --> 00:29:00,550
Speaker 0: Now, theoretically, if you were to press the keys completely randomly, if you had a fair coin, or maybe some other random, you know, true random number generator, and used that to decide which of the two keys to press, this would eventually say 50%.

390
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:05,310
Speaker 0: There's no way it could do 50% or better than that, or worse, really.

391
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,509
Speaker 1: I've been holding it, I'm doing it live on the stream, I've been holding it at 50% for a while now.

392
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:10,513
Speaker 0: Alright.

393
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:15,211
Speaker 0: But that's like, the best you can possibly do is 50%.

394
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:23,650
Speaker 0: Now, if you're a human being, and you try to press the keys in a way you think is random, but you are not so random as you think you are, right?

395
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:31,690
Speaker 0: You have some pattern to you that you may not perceive with your flawed human brain, and perception of what is random.

396
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,891
Speaker 1: Uh oh, 51%.

397
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:42,071
Speaker 0: Yeah, this will, over time, eventually, catch your pattern, and it should get around 70%.

398
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,330
Speaker 0: So, the question is, do you have free will?

399
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:52,490
Speaker 0: Can you truly generate randomness on your own, right, with your own mind and fingers?

400
00:29:53,230 --> 00:30:00,370
Speaker 0: Obviously, if you bring some other tool into play, like if you roll a D6 on your table, and then press the keys accordingly, you're going to get 50%.

401
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:06,309
Speaker 1: Because I've been going deep into physics, there is a broader question that could be asked of, is there such a thing as randomness?

402
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,692
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

403
00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:16,170
Speaker 0: And if you want to know how this works, I'm not going to explain it to you, but you can click the link on the page and read all about it, and it's open source.

404
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,370
Speaker 0: You can literally read the code and see how it works.

405
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,138
Speaker 0: It's not that complicated, actually.

406
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:22,790
Speaker 0: You could make it actually a lot nastier.

407
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:25,890
Speaker 0: This is a pretty simple implementation of the guessing.

408
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:30,930
Speaker 0: But you don't really need a much stronger implementation, right?

409
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:36,710
Speaker 0: Basically, this is enough to separate the people who think they're random from actual random.

410
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,490
Speaker 1: I'm feeling pretty good about how random I am, but I would bet I have a supposition.

411
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:52,349
Speaker 1: Someone who can keep this very close to 50% over a very long number of presses is probably better at tabletop games than someone who cannot do this.

412
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:53,542
Speaker 0: Maybe.

413
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:59,810
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is the collected Murderbot Diaries.

414
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:06,070
Speaker 1: I have read every Murderbot that has boughted, that is out there and available for purchase.

415
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:07,188
Speaker 0: The same.

416
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:18,970
Speaker 1: I got a lot to say about the Murderbot Diaries, but the TLDL is... They're great, fun, fast reads, and anyone who is interested in science fiction, just read them.

417
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:21,429
Speaker 1: They're so short, they're so fast.

418
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,384
Speaker 1: I like pretty much everything about these books.

419
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:25,710
Speaker 1: I have no strong complaints.

420
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:32,390
Speaker 1: I mostly want to engage with what is portrayed, how it's portrayed, and why it's portrayed the way it's portrayed when we talk about it in the book club.

421
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:40,369
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we the Geek Nights Panels at PAX Unplugged on Friday at 5pm.

422
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,490
Speaker 1: We're teaching you how to play Wist, Hearts, and Wizard.

423
00:31:45,872 --> 00:31:49,470
Speaker 1: And then Saturday, 2.30pm in the Crab God Theater, mastering game mechanics.

424
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:57,170
Speaker 1: 58 minutes, give or take, of Rym and Scott talking about nothing but the concept of worker placement in tabletop games.

425
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,683
Speaker 1: The website's live, keep giving us feedback, thoughts, comments, any...

426
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:10,390
Speaker 0: You can send your website feedback to any of our communication mechanisms, our forum, our email, our whatever.

427
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:22,890
Speaker 0: But the best one would be go directly to the GitHub, right, where the source code of the website is and make issues or even better pull requests to save me some work.

428
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,610
Speaker 0: The next feature I'm working on is automatic forum posting so Rym doesn't have to copy pasta every single episode.

429
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get there bit by bit.

430
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:32,518
Speaker 0: I don't think it'll be that hard.

431
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,450
Speaker 0: I came up with a way to do it nicely.

432
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:42,370
Speaker 1: So, there aren't many game series that we review every single one that comes out other than Nintendo first party titles.

433
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,189
Speaker 1: But Jack in the Box or Jack Box Games.

434
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,187
Speaker 0: Jack in the Box.

435
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:47,989
Speaker 1: Jack in the Box.

436
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:50,729
Speaker 0: I mean, that's part of where the name comes from.

437
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:52,550
Speaker 1: The Jack Box Party Packs.

438
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:59,410
Speaker 0: I don't know how many people realize that back in the 90s there were these CD-ROM games called You Don't Know Jack.

439
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:05,210
Speaker 0: And it was basically a party video game for DOS/Windows 95, whatever, I don't even remember.

440
00:33:05,932 --> 00:33:14,410
Speaker 0: But you would basically, you would sit around the computer with this game and everyone would have a key on the keyboard, right, that was theirs.

441
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:22,890
Speaker 0: And it was a trivia game and it had the narrator just like, right, and you would push your key to ring in on the keyboard and then you could answer the trivia.

442
00:33:23,472 --> 00:33:26,749
Speaker 0: And it was, you know, you were competing against the other people who were sitting there.

443
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:30,050
Speaker 0: And that's how Jack Box Party Pack came to be.

444
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,690
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's the same company or someone else just bought the license to the You Don't Know Jack property.

445
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:45,270
Speaker 0: But whoever owns the property realized that they could do web sockets and people had phones and you could connect your phone as the input device to the game running on the TV.

446
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:50,450
Speaker 0: Which is what Nintendo should have done with, you know, they didn't ever use that to the full potential.

447
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,690
Speaker 1: With like three different generations of Nintendo hardware could and should have done that but didn't.

448
00:33:56,051 --> 00:34:04,970
Speaker 0: Why can't, why isn't there a game where we can have like one switch connected to the TV and everyone sitting around still has their own switch and you just have six switches or whatever.

449
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:16,949
Speaker 1: Also, why has almost everyone who has ever tried to do web socket stuff like what Jack Box games have done with their phones either failed at it or made terrible games like Jack Box.

450
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,955
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's hard to, it's hard to program.

451
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:23,790
Speaker 0: I think that's their value is that they put the effort in to program that server, that platform.

452
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:32,909
Speaker 0: And then because they have the platform made, every year they can just crank out more games on that platform without having to redevelop that core technology.

453
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:38,409
Speaker 0: And that core technology is not easily, you can't just download an open source thing that just does that.

454
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,670
Speaker 1: Well this is why I think there are three primary factors on why Jack Box games have been so successful with this series.

455
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:51,210
Speaker 1: One, they have this technology and even if they never improve it, it works like shockingly well.

456
00:34:51,389 --> 00:35:01,810
Speaker 1: So, Milk, if you got a platform that works in any industry and nobody else has a competing platform that can do what that does, Milk it for as long as you can, maybe forever.

457
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:13,710
Speaker 1: But two, they are, every one of these games, they keep pushing the envelope like it's clear they're investing in making this technology platform even better.

458
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:28,530
Speaker 1: As evidence now, when they attempted something that I didn't think they would actually ever attempt of a rhythm game that requires synchronization and timing, and it's not perfect, but that is a bold move which implies that they are trying to make this platform better.

459
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:41,224
Speaker 1: And three, they have invested heavily in very active game design that is very tuned to and reactive to how people play these games.

460
00:35:41,324 --> 00:35:46,350
Speaker 1: Like the game design that goes into Jack Box games is very good.

461
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:56,990
Speaker 0: Alright, so Jack Box comes out, if you don't know, they have a new one every single year basically in October, which coincidentally is just in time for a Halloween party and a Thanksgiving party.

462
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:02,882
Speaker 0: All the times when your family is going to get together, and these are very family friendly, so it's like.

463
00:36:02,922 --> 00:36:05,990
Speaker 0: I think that's very strategic and it works out for them, right?

464
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:11,281
Speaker 0: And then just when you get bored of those games, guess what, next year there's another one available.

465
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:15,530
Speaker 0: And you know what, maybe you didn't get bored of them, you didn't see your family that year because it was the dark times.

466
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:20,480
Speaker 0: And you didn't play the Jack Box games enough that you bought, guess what, they're still good.

467
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,430
Speaker 0: Even Jack Box 1 and the original, all those ones still work, they keep them up.

468
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:42,470
Speaker 0: And so you can buy any of the party packs and those games still work, so if at any time, maybe your family has never played any of these, you just pick one of the packs and you start playing it, and eventually you get bored of it, there will always be another pack available for you to buy, even if that's not the newest one.

469
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,574
Speaker 0: And if it's an older one, good, you save money, right?

470
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:46,835
Speaker 0: You don't have to buy a newer one.

471
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:59,690
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in the newest pack, pack 10, which we're 8 years older than them because Geek Nights is 18 and Jack Box is 10, they have released 5 new games, right?

472
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:04,615
Speaker 0: One of which is, you know, usually they have the same sort of mix of games, right?

473
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:18,210
Speaker 0: They'll do like a redo upgrade of an older game that they know is good, they'll do always has to be a trivia game of some kind, and then the rest are sort of, you know, new ideas, twists on old ideas, things of that nature.

474
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,594
Speaker 0: So Rym mentioned the rhythm game, let's talk about that one.

475
00:37:21,215 --> 00:37:30,110
Speaker 0: The rhythm game is called Dodoremi, and it is not, as far as I can tell, a competition between players as the others.

476
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:30,911
Speaker 1: Oh, not at all.

477
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:44,970
Speaker 1: Dodoremi is basically Rock Band with everybody's phones, and it's actually pretty well designed for what it is, but it really feels like it's a toy and a tech demo.

478
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is version 1.0.

479
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:55,782
Speaker 0: It is impressive that the way it works is everyone connects like normal to Jack Box, then it makes everybody go tap, tap, tap, like in sync.

480
00:37:56,023 --> 00:38:02,070
Speaker 0: You get this one chance to sync, and that syncs everyone's music devices together.

481
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:15,770
Speaker 1: And while that was a mistake, it needs more taps, and a second round of refinement, and an ability to redo it, because every time we tried to play, at least one person wasn't ready and didn't tap, and was desynced from everybody else.

482
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,418
Speaker 0: Yep, it's like, there needs to be a button you can press to like, "Alright, let's redo the taps.

483
00:38:20,518 --> 00:38:20,898
Speaker 0: Everyone

484
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:21,600
Speaker 0: ready?".

485
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,106
Speaker 0: It just comes at you, and it's like, "Okay, here we're gonna do the taps.

486
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:25,667
Speaker 0: Go, go, go.

487
00:38:26,128 --> 00:38:26,849
Speaker 0: Tap, tap,

488
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,150
Speaker 0: tap.".

489
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,591
Speaker 0: It's like, "What?

490
00:38:27,671 --> 00:38:28,272
Speaker 0: I wasn't ready

491
00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:29,334
Speaker 0: yet.".

492
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:33,182
Speaker 0: Also, I tapped once early, and then I was like, "Shit, I tapped once early.

493
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:34,746
Speaker 0: I used one of my three taps.

494
00:38:34,806 --> 00:38:36,509
Speaker 0: I can't correct it in any

495
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:36,750
Speaker 0: way.".

496
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:46,530
Speaker 0: So, I understand they don't want to bog it down with a whole bunch of synchronization time, and then you ruin the game because everyone's doing that over and over.

497
00:38:46,550 --> 00:39:02,570
Speaker 1: I can't imagine the group of people who want to play this game actively, and the kind of person who would be very excited about this game, is the same group of people where everyone is 100% on point, knows how their phone works, gets the volume set right, does the tap in unison, and doesn't fuck it up.

498
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:07,558
Speaker 0: But anyway, you get it synced, and then you choose an instrument.

499
00:39:07,618 --> 00:39:12,227
Speaker 0: I completely missed choosing an instrument because I was too fuffled from messing up my tap sync.

500
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:14,070
Speaker 0: So, that was annoying.

501
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:25,530
Speaker 0: Everyone chooses an instrument, and then you play a really simple rhythm game where there's basically three lines with notes coming down, and you tap on your touch screen.

502
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:25,651
Speaker 1: Three?

503
00:39:25,752 --> 00:39:27,590
Speaker 1: I had like eight or nine.

504
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:30,230
Speaker 0: I don't remember how many there were.

505
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,688
Speaker 1: I think it depends on the instrument you pick, too.

506
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:37,890
Speaker 0: Maybe, but dots are falling down from the top of your screen to the bottom, and you just tap on them when they hit the point.

507
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,870
Speaker 1: It's just Guitar Hero effectively with tapping on lines.

508
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:52,630
Speaker 0: It's the most basic rhythm game, and you play it, and everyone plays together, and if you've got all these different instruments, it sounds like you're playing the song using the weird instruments.

509
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:56,917
Speaker 1: The cool part is, the phones make the sounds.

510
00:39:57,277 --> 00:40:05,210
Speaker 1: So, if you're in a place that's quiet enough, then you hear all the different phones making the sounds live, and it actually is pretty cool.

511
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:18,850
Speaker 1: The problem was, half our friends either didn't turn their volume on on purpose because they didn't want to, or were unable to because they didn't really know how their phones worked because they had never set their phones to anything but silent ever.

512
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:24,121
Speaker 0: Yep, or they only use their phone with headphones.

513
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:27,870
Speaker 0: You don't have enough time to set up and make sure that that shit is working.

514
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:37,190
Speaker 0: There needs to be a completely paused screen where everyone can verify and all that shit that the other games don't require.

515
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:51,850
Speaker 0: But, I gotta say, for something that is using web sockets on phones, of all random browsers on phones, the amount that it works when it does work, and the real-time-ness of it, is pretty impressive, actually.

516
00:40:51,870 --> 00:41:03,930
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I picked an instrument that gave me a very "through the fire and through the flame" situation, and it just worked, and it sounded fine, and the tapping lined up, and I felt it was fair and accurate and well synced.

517
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:19,427
Speaker 0: Yep, so after everyone plays the song, it basically replays the song as you played it, sort of a recording of your inputs, and then if you, as a group, did well enough, you defeat this monster, and it's like, "Hooray!

518
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,870
Speaker 0: We came close, but we did not defeat the

519
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,110
Speaker 0: monster.".

520
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,065
Speaker 1: Yep.

521
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:24,908
Speaker 0: So I don't know what happens when you beat it.

522
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,919
Speaker 1: I think it just unlocks more stuff.

523
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:28,670
Speaker 1: It has an unlocking progression.

524
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:33,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you play it enough, you unlock more songs.

525
00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:38,727
Speaker 0: It forces you to do this tutorial song, then it unlocks another set of basic songs.

526
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:40,210
Speaker 0: We didn't unlock beyond that.

527
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,713
Speaker 1: Yep, I feel like this is just like you said.

528
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:47,039
Speaker 1: This is the tech demo, proof of concept version 0.1.

529
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:55,570
Speaker 1: I am pretty confident Party Pack 11 or 12 is gonna have a much more evolved rhythm game based on the experience and feedback from this one.

530
00:41:57,051 --> 00:42:03,978
Speaker 0: I would recommend this to people who are like, if you're crazy about rhythm games, this will disappoint you because it's so basic, right?

531
00:42:04,078 --> 00:42:15,910
Speaker 0: But if you just like rhythm games, and you would kind of like to play one with other people like Rock Band once in a while, but you don't want to have any plastic instruments in your house, then this is okay to have.

532
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:21,050
Speaker 0: And it will be much cooler when they have Dodo or Amy 2 in the future, right?

533
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:35,220
Speaker 1: So, game number two, because I think every Jackbox Party Pack has at least one trivia game, you know, the origins of Jackbox, and full disclosure, Scott and I are generally not big fans of trivia games.

534
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:40,768
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, trivia games sort of fall into like these two categories, right?

535
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:46,517
Speaker 0: Where some trivia games like Trivial Pursuit, which is like the worst, right, is sort of these binary trivia games, right?

536
00:42:46,558 --> 00:42:48,060
Speaker 0: You know it or you don't.

537
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,613
Speaker 0: Jeopardy, for all the good things you can say about Jeopardy, is a really binary game.

538
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:54,298
Speaker 0: You either know it or you don't.

539
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,120
Speaker 0: The end, right?

540
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:03,760
Speaker 1: You need a very well matched set of intersecting knowledge of people or someone just runs away with a trivia game and someone else just literally can answer zero questions.

541
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,081
Speaker 1: Right.

542
00:43:04,261 --> 00:43:09,190
Speaker 0: So for trivia to be good, you either need like really brainy people, really targeted questions.

543
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:14,780
Speaker 0: You need to have groups of people who can on teams, like at a bar where people could pool their knowledge.

544
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:22,080
Speaker 0: And then thus they will, someone on your team might have a chance of knowing the answer, having a good guess, even if someone else is clueless.

545
00:43:22,781 --> 00:43:28,800
Speaker 0: And because otherwise, if you just don't know the answers, it's like it's the most pointless thing in the world.

546
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,443
Speaker 1: What are you going to do?

547
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:33,080
Speaker 1: There's no power up to make you know the answers except cheating and looking at your phone.

548
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:48,800
Speaker 0: So the other the other kind of trivia game that's good, the high quality trivia games are usually involve things where you can figure it out or it's like horseshoes where you guess and you get points for getting close.

549
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:55,480
Speaker 0: So I think if you look for a Geek Nights episode about the America/Flora Fauna by Friedman Freese board game.

550
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:56,540
Speaker 1: I'll link to our review.

551
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,033
Speaker 0: We do an episode on wits and wagers.

552
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:00,079
Speaker 0: That's a similar one.

553
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:00,841
Speaker 1: Yeah.

554
00:44:01,261 --> 00:44:14,560
Speaker 0: There's a lot of trivia games out there where you just had to get close and there's ways of guessing and like you can use your general knowledge to have educated guesses when you don't just fucking know the answer immediately.

555
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,504
Speaker 1: What state was Jaws set in?

556
00:44:16,584 --> 00:44:22,076
Speaker 1: Well, I may not know what state it was set in, but I know it's a movie about a shark attack.

557
00:44:22,317 --> 00:44:23,740
Speaker 1: So that narrows it down already.

558
00:44:24,825 --> 00:44:25,860
Speaker 0: Like, yep, exactly.

559
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:31,400
Speaker 1: So Time Jinks, the trivia game in this one, is in that second category mostly.

560
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:35,105
Speaker 1: It's actually I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would.

561
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:38,030
Speaker 1: And I would play it again because it reminds me of...

562
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,231
Speaker 0: One of the better, maybe the best, possibly trivia games that's in there.

563
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:51,416
Speaker 0: I like it a lot better than that one where the horror one.

564
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:53,689
Speaker 0: Oh, the murder one.

565
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,379
Speaker 0: I hate that one.

566
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,668
Speaker 0: The murder one, yeah.

567
00:44:56,112 --> 00:44:57,060
Speaker 0: This is much better than that.

568
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,544
Speaker 1: And this one, the shit's pretty simple.

569
00:44:58,564 --> 00:45:04,160
Speaker 1: It's a lot like there's a board game we played at I think the first Unplugged where you line up with the Chronology one.

570
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:10,618
Speaker 1: There's a few trivia games that are kind of like that, but this one basically is the answer is always a year.

571
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:15,571
Speaker 1: And you guess the year and it gives you a range to guess within.

572
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:18,340
Speaker 1: So like, what year did India gain its independence?

573
00:45:18,621 --> 00:45:27,600
Speaker 1: And it gives you a range of dates and just pick a date and you get scored based on how close you got to the date and it shows you where everybody picked.

574
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:30,670
Speaker 1: And that's pretty much it.

575
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:32,540
Speaker 1: Like it just does that over and over in various forms.

576
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:39,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's some hints and other twists and turns, but that's the fundamental game is how close can you get to the correct year.

577
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:51,320
Speaker 1: But it has two game design elements that I think are actually significant evolutions of game show/trivia scoring that I think people might not notice.

578
00:45:51,560 --> 00:46:10,860
Speaker 1: And I think they're very important because the main problem with a trivia game that is horseshoes adjacent, like the good category, is that even if that is true, if someone like gets good answers, like is doing well early, then they'll just win in the end and there's really no way to catch up.

579
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,911
Speaker 1: And if someone like really stinks it up early, they kind of just can't win in the end.

580
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:18,000
Speaker 1: Like the outcome is predetermined pretty quick.

581
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:24,920
Speaker 1: So most games, especially game shows, do the escalation and a lot of Jackbox games up to this point do the escalation.

582
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:27,886
Speaker 1: So round one, you get one point per answer.

583
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:30,371
Speaker 1: Round two, you get ten points per answer.

584
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:35,020
Speaker 1: Round three, you get a thousand points per answer to give people a chance to catch up.

585
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,160
Speaker 1: That doesn't necessarily work for all the reasons as a Geek Nights listener you can imagine.

586
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:51,520
Speaker 0: Basically, once you know that that's going to happen, you realize that the early rounds are meaningless and you're just sort of fooling around and then everything depends on the final answer, which is not that satisfying.

587
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,887
Speaker 1: So in general, catch up mechanisms in games like this tend to be unsatisfying in varying ways.

588
00:46:57,227 --> 00:47:06,800
Speaker 1: The way this one handles that is, one, it divides the playing field after the first question, or the second question, at some point pretty early.

589
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:18,360
Speaker 1: And whoever is below the line gets a pretty good hint that it's almost like you get two trivia questions that both have the same answer and it really helps you out.

590
00:47:19,025 --> 00:47:20,479
Speaker 0: As long as you know one of them, you're good.

591
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:31,520
Speaker 1: And it sucks not getting that answer because I would have definitely 100% of the rest of the game had gotten those extra answers, but I didn't get those answers because I was in second place and that was probably for the best.

592
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:43,420
Speaker 1: But two, the way the secondary escalation happens is not get more points later in the game, or in this case get fewer because you're trying to be lowest score.

593
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:44,684
Speaker 0: It's like golf, right?

594
00:47:44,704 --> 00:47:46,750
Speaker 0: So when you're close, you're getting a lower score.

595
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,057
Speaker 0: If you get a higher score, how many years off are you?

596
00:47:49,538 --> 00:47:50,180
Speaker 0: That's bad.

597
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,175
Speaker 1: Like if you think the French Revolution happened in the 1900s, well yeah.

598
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:54,626
Speaker 0: Oopsie!

599
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:12,620
Speaker 1: But the way the escalation works, there are rounds toward the end where instead of getting a bigger score differential, you are competing for what is your current score reduced by in terms of a percentage.

600
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:26,378
Speaker 1: And that is very clever because if you are doing poorly and you are spot on, like you get the perfect answer in the final round, it'll reduce your score by like 50 or 60%, which is huge.

601
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,305
Speaker 1: That could make you go higher in the ranking materially.

602
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:31,967
Speaker 1: Could even win it.

603
00:48:32,608 --> 00:48:38,980
Speaker 1: But if you are already doing very well, if you stink it up, well you're not going to reduce your score.

604
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:45,540
Speaker 1: But even if you get it perfectly, alright, I reduced my score of 16 by 50% down to 80.

605
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:52,080
Speaker 0: Right, you're basically just sort of collapsing the scores and like sort of like basically grading on a curve, right?

606
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,805
Speaker 0: But the thing is you have to do good in the curve round.

607
00:48:55,865 --> 00:49:02,496
Speaker 0: It's like rather than just automatically putting everyone in a curve to squish everyone together, it's like alright, here's your chance.

608
00:49:02,637 --> 00:49:04,460
Speaker 0: How much are you going to get curved?

609
00:49:05,101 --> 00:49:14,720
Speaker 1: And it works really well because generally the people who were doing well the whole game will still be ranked very highly at the end because it's a trivia game.

610
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,959
Speaker 1: Like if you know the answers, you're just going to win.

611
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,340
Speaker 0: But if you fucked up like one question really bad but you know what's up, you can get back into things.

612
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,938
Speaker 0: And if one of those people ahead of you, then they screw up after that round and now they don't have a chance, now you could win.

613
00:49:29,941 --> 00:49:34,368
Speaker 1: And it also lets the player's rankings, even though you're not going to win.

614
00:49:34,448 --> 00:49:41,680
Speaker 1: if you were stinking it up, you could easily go from last place to like third or fourth place just by being really good in that final round.

615
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:49,096
Speaker 1: So it gives the less experienced or skilled players a last hurrah that feels meaningful to them but doesn't disrupt who really won the game.

616
00:49:49,477 --> 00:49:50,720
Speaker 1: So good design.

617
00:49:51,983 --> 00:49:55,520
Speaker 0: Alright, let's talk about, instead of saving the best for last, let's just go for it.

618
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:02,820
Speaker 0: So TKO, one of our favorite Jackbox games of all time, if not the favorite, the game where you design t-shirts and then laugh at them.

619
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,227
Speaker 0: And it's mostly for humor and not about winning really.

620
00:50:06,688 --> 00:50:10,880
Speaker 0: They came out with TKO2, which is the reason to get this thing.

621
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,420
Speaker 0: Obviously if you like TKO1, you're going to like TKO2 because it's the same fucking thing.

622
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,520
Speaker 1: Yep, just streamlined with a little bit of extra sauce.

623
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:27,040
Speaker 0: Yep, you draw shirts, you write slogans, then you mix them up and combine them into shirts or now, hoodies and tank tops.

624
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:36,498
Speaker 1: Which I didn't think would have a huge impact but a particular tank top in the game we played, I think won because it was a tank top.

625
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:37,240
Speaker 1: It was too perfect.

626
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,525
Speaker 0: Yep, I think it definitely matters, right?

627
00:50:40,986 --> 00:50:43,330
Speaker 0: But then you vote on which ones are the best.

628
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:48,520
Speaker 0: They have a little tournament between the t-shirts and the shirts, the top clothings.

629
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,964
Speaker 0: And one of them is the winner.

630
00:50:51,325 --> 00:50:54,294
Speaker 0: Now, things that they have done to improve over TKO1.

631
00:50:54,354 --> 00:50:56,260
Speaker 0: First of all, the lore.

632
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,260
Speaker 0: So in TKO1, there are all these characters that you could choose.

633
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,060
Speaker 1: And they're all like yokai of some kind.

634
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,905
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was Umbrella Guy, Snake Guy, right?

635
00:51:05,286 --> 00:51:10,636
Speaker 0: In TKO2, all of those characters are sort of in the background as ghosts.

636
00:51:11,017 --> 00:51:12,660
Speaker 0: They died in t-shirt battles.

637
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,830
Speaker 0: Except the bunny has returned as a playable character.

638
00:51:18,071 --> 00:51:22,179
Speaker 0: He's all old and grizzled like a war veteran with an eye patch and shit.

639
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:30,620
Speaker 0: Thus, they're trying to tell you the bunny won TKO1 and is back again like it's Battle Royale or some shit.

640
00:51:31,504 --> 00:51:32,569
Speaker 1: On t-shirt island.

641
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,960
Speaker 0: Battle Royale is also on an island.

642
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:41,772
Speaker 0: So the last surviving TKO battler from TKO1 is the bunny.

643
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:43,777
Speaker 0: And all the other combatants are new.

644
00:51:43,998 --> 00:51:44,960
Speaker 0: They're all new characters.

645
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,526
Speaker 1: But it's just streamlined.

646
00:51:47,546 --> 00:51:49,832
Speaker 1: I think it takes 30-50% less time to play around.

647
00:51:54,104 --> 00:51:55,007
Speaker 0: So that's the big thing.

648
00:51:55,187 --> 00:51:56,772
Speaker 0: Number one, the speed.

649
00:51:57,093 --> 00:51:59,200
Speaker 0: The tournament just goes faster.

650
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,868
Speaker 0: They're like alright, his two shirts, vote.

651
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:01,953
Speaker 0: His two, vote.

652
00:52:02,154 --> 00:52:02,958
Speaker 0: His two, vote.

653
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:03,300
Speaker 0: Done.

654
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:07,720
Speaker 0: The other one would be like give you all sorts of time and play all sorts of music.

655
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:12,457
Speaker 0: It's like this one does it as fast as it can go without it being too fast.

656
00:52:12,778 --> 00:52:13,240
Speaker 0: Which is great.

657
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,400
Speaker 0: You're doing the same exact thing and just faster and more exciting.

658
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:22,340
Speaker 0: And the other thing is that the tools for drawing the shirts are vastly improved.

659
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,428
Speaker 0: More colors, you got two different markers.

660
00:52:25,468 --> 00:52:29,580
Speaker 0: It's just the drawing tool is way better than it was before.

661
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,444
Speaker 0: Which is nice.

662
00:52:30,464 --> 00:52:32,520
Speaker 0: To get more creative.

663
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:33,080
Speaker 0: Oh!

664
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:46,600
Speaker 0: The one other change is that in the second round of drawing t-shirts, instead of drawing a completely new shirt, you could take a previous shirt and edit it instead and add on.

665
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:51,020
Speaker 0: You might even add on to someone else's shirt that they drew in the first round of drawing.

666
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:52,299
Speaker 0: And that could be fun.

667
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,884
Speaker 1: I like that addition.

668
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:58,220
Speaker 1: Just giving players a little more agency just makes a game like this better.

669
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,920
Speaker 0: I think it'd be really cool if one person can't draw and another person draws really well.

670
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,640
Speaker 0: And a really well drawn shirt makes it to the second round or doesn't make it.

671
00:53:09,122 --> 00:53:12,420
Speaker 0: And then someone who can't draw puts googly eyes on it or something.

672
00:53:13,261 --> 00:53:14,864
Speaker 0: But also vice versa.

673
00:53:15,065 --> 00:53:22,580
Speaker 0: You draw a piece of crap drawing and then the artist in the room gets that and remixes it in round two for a masterpiece.

674
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:26,358
Speaker 0: So that possibility is opened up by TKO2.

675
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,700
Speaker 0: I think if you like TKO, you should get TKO2.

676
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:36,277
Speaker 0: And basically there's no reason to play TKO1 anymore ever because TKO2 is the exact same thing, only better.

677
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:37,020
Speaker 0: The end.

678
00:53:37,241 --> 00:53:37,421
Speaker 0: Yep.

679
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:41,620
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the weakest entry, I think, which would be fixie text.

680
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,175
Speaker 0: You think fixie text is the weakest?

681
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,426
Speaker 1: I think it's interesting.

682
00:53:46,506 --> 00:53:50,400
Speaker 0: I think the two remaining ones are equally weak, I think.

683
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, but weak for different reasons.

684
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,100
Speaker 1: So there's hypnotorious and fixie text.

685
00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:05,920
Speaker 1: The shtick with fixie text is you get divided into teams and a group of you type in a text message responding to someone and your goal is basically to be a prick.

686
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:14,580
Speaker 0: There is a text conversation between two fictional characters and one of them says something and another one replies.

687
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:19,074
Speaker 0: And then that reply that's already pre-generated, right?

688
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:20,480
Speaker 0: It's not an empty text box.

689
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:28,060
Speaker 0: Everybody on your team can now edit that reply, but only by adding on to it.

690
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,679
Speaker 1: Put your cursor somewhere and start typing.

691
00:54:30,422 --> 00:54:30,723
Speaker 0: Right.

692
00:54:30,783 --> 00:54:35,235
Speaker 0: All you can do is place your cursor somewhere in the text box and add characters.

693
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:36,900
Speaker 0: You can't backspace anything ever.

694
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:40,490
Speaker 0: And each person has a limit to how many characters they can add.

695
00:54:40,871 --> 00:54:44,160
Speaker 0: If everyone adds the maximum characters, the text box will be full.

696
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:56,540
Speaker 0: And then after you're done editing the response collaboratively, everyone votes on which words in the text box are the funniest.

697
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:00,420
Speaker 1: Like you pick five and you can double tap to pick one twice if you want.

698
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:09,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like instead of voting for like, you know, five words once each, you could vote for like two words once each and then a word twice.

699
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:12,950
Speaker 0: And then I guess with only five votes, you'd have to vote another one.

700
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:13,933
Speaker 0: You get the idea.

701
00:55:13,973 --> 00:55:14,756
Speaker 0: You can only double.

702
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:16,020
Speaker 0: You can't triple vote a word.

703
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:16,740
Speaker 1: My complaints and concerns.

704
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,140
Speaker 0: But if you double vote a word, that's less words total you can vote on.

705
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:33,027
Speaker 1: I think there is a crowd where this game could be extremely funny, but because of how difficult and chaotic it is to type in the thing, I feel like most games anyone will ever play of.

706
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:38,680
Speaker 1: this will devolve into the swear words and the outrageous nonsense kind of wins the day.

707
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:44,880
Speaker 1: It's very hard to be purposefully and cleverly funny just the way it ends up playing out.

708
00:55:45,502 --> 00:55:51,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you just insert your cursor and write poop ass, whatever, and you'll probably win with a well-placed poop.

709
00:55:52,480 --> 00:56:02,060
Speaker 1: And two, this game suffers from the fact that while one team is typing, the other team just has to fucking sit there doing nothing.

710
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:13,920
Speaker 1: That is a sin against most of the Jackbox games up to this point in that the game design of Jackbox games very rarely has players doing nothing for an extended period of time.

711
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:22,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but active players rarely are just sitting there with no way to interact in any way for longer than a trivial amount of time.

712
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,140
Speaker 0: Not only no way to interact, but no reason to pay attention so much.

713
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:26,400
Speaker 0: Yep.

714
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:31,751
Speaker 1: In fact, it's not even fun to watch what's happening on the screen.

715
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:36,480
Speaker 1: It is fun to try to type and it's fun to vote, but everything in between is not that fun.

716
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:43,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't even think the voting is that fun, but I do think the positive of this one is the technological aspect of that.

717
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:46,969
Speaker 0: The real-time editing is a lot like, you know, a Google Doc, right?

718
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:51,620
Speaker 0: Everyone's typing in a Google Doc together all at the same time and they're using that technology.

719
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,066
Speaker 1: Yep, and there's definitely something there.

720
00:56:55,427 --> 00:57:00,760
Speaker 1: We have conversed in the past about competitive Google spreadsheet as a game somehow.

721
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:02,683
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

722
00:57:02,763 --> 00:57:05,148
Speaker 0: So, and then Hypnotorious.

723
00:57:05,228 --> 00:57:10,256
Speaker 0: Hypnotorious is basically, it's a lot like a game of werewolves, sort of, right?

724
00:57:10,437 --> 00:57:12,340
Speaker 0: Where it's a hidden role game, right?

725
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:18,531
Speaker 0: And so basically everyone gets assigned an identity, a unique identity, right?

726
00:57:18,932 --> 00:57:23,320
Speaker 0: And you don't know what anyone else's identity is unless you look at their phones.

727
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:29,790
Speaker 0: And then there are categories, and you don't know what the categories are, right?

728
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:34,317
Speaker 0: So one time we played, the category was like '90s movies, 2000s movies...

729
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,889
Speaker 1: It was '90s TV shows, 2000s TV shows, 2010s TV shows.

730
00:57:40,909 --> 00:57:42,852
Speaker 1: So that's, I guess, the most important thing.

731
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:47,320
Speaker 1: When I went into this game, I thought the categories would be very ham-fisted, Jackbox style.

732
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:52,140
Speaker 0: Like TV shows, fruit, and, you know, sports teams.

733
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,023
Speaker 1: They were so narrow.

734
00:57:54,164 --> 00:57:58,136
Speaker 1: One of the other games, it was, what, smooth things?

735
00:57:58,878 --> 00:57:59,580
Speaker 1: Crunchy things?

736
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,126
Speaker 0: Chunky things, and something else, right?

737
00:58:03,527 --> 00:58:06,333
Speaker 0: So it's like, you don't know what the categories are.

738
00:58:06,473 --> 00:58:09,920
Speaker 0: Nobody knows what the categories are, but you know what your identity is.

739
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:17,340
Speaker 0: And it asks you these questions, and everyone answers the questions as taking on the role of their identity.

740
00:58:17,881 --> 00:58:22,171
Speaker 0: So it's like, "Hey, you know, what would you do on a first date or

741
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:22,613
Speaker 0: something?".

742
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:24,036
Speaker 0: And it's like, "I'm Peanut Butter.

743
00:58:24,056 --> 00:58:25,099
Speaker 0: What do I do on a first

744
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:25,460
Speaker 0: date?".

745
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:31,360
Speaker 1: I am the '90s award-winning sitcom, Seinfeld, as a concept.

746
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,101
Speaker 0: Right.

747
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:34,006
Speaker 0: It's like, you know.

748
00:58:34,026 --> 00:58:35,414
Speaker 0: Then it asks you, what did it ask you?

749
00:58:35,434 --> 00:58:36,520
Speaker 0: What did you do on a holiday?

750
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:41,340
Speaker 1: Yup, so I was like, "Air My Grievance," like the Festivus poll, "Air My Grievance," or something, something.

751
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,608
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

752
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:44,179
Speaker 0: So now everyone knows what RIM is, right?

753
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:52,160
Speaker 1: But the funniest thing is, because the categories were so narrow, four people all thought they were in the same category as me.

754
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,365
Speaker 0: Right, well, because we're all TV shows.

755
00:58:54,425 --> 00:58:57,996
Speaker 0: So it's like, I'm like, "Oh, I'm a TV show, and RIM is obviously a TV show.

756
00:58:58,056 --> 00:58:58,939
Speaker 0: We're probably in the same

757
00:58:58,979 --> 00:58:59,340
Speaker 0: category.".

758
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,585
Speaker 0: I was X-Files, right?

759
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:03,156
Speaker 0: So it's like, I'm probably with RIM, right?

760
00:59:03,176 --> 00:59:04,060
Speaker 0: Because we're both TV shows.

761
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:10,514
Speaker 1: When Scott was like, "I want to believe," I realized 100%, and we were fully telepathically linked, it's '90s TV shows.

762
00:59:10,534 --> 00:59:12,218
Speaker 1: Like, we knew it was '90s.

763
00:59:12,278 --> 00:59:13,120
Speaker 1: We felt it.

764
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:18,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think it gave us a hint that the time period mattered at some point.

765
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:23,709
Speaker 0: But it's like, if we didn't know what the categories were, right?

766
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:29,500
Speaker 0: Then other people who were like, "TV shows from other eras," would strongly believe that they're in our group, right?

767
00:59:29,861 --> 00:59:39,200
Speaker 0: And basically, you're trying to, on your own, sort of organize, without anyone knowing the categories, into three buckets.

768
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:46,520
Speaker 0: And you want to be in the correct bucket with the people who are in your category, without knowing what your category is.

769
00:59:47,302 --> 00:59:51,420
Speaker 0: You're trying to figure out who you're similar with based on your answers to these questions.

770
00:59:51,941 --> 01:00:02,320
Speaker 0: And the final, you know, kink, the twist, is that there will always be one person, they don't know who they are, who is in a category on their own.

771
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:06,510
Speaker 0: So there's three groups, and one group always has exactly one person.

772
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:10,680
Speaker 0: The other two groups will have at least two people each, but you don't know how many.

773
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:17,380
Speaker 0: It could be divided evenly, it could be, you know, like, the whole lot, and then just two in the other group, you don't know.

774
01:00:18,061 --> 01:00:26,580
Speaker 0: And you don't know what the groups are, and you're trying to arrange yourself in the right groups, and to get points, and there is some cleverness to that design.

775
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,380
Speaker 0: And there's a little bit of humor in the answering of the questions, right?

776
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:37,955
Speaker 1: My only real complaint is that victory, like, the scoring is kind of meaningless, and victory doesn't matter.

777
01:00:38,396 --> 01:00:40,200
Speaker 0: The only thing that's fun about it is the process.

778
01:00:41,161 --> 01:00:53,100
Speaker 0: If you are the outlier, the one who's in a group by yourself, you are very likely going to win because there's a point at which everyone votes on who they think the outlier is, like, mid-game.

779
01:00:53,960 --> 01:01:01,320
Speaker 0: And if they don't vote, like, with a majority, or if they don't get it right, then the outlier gets, like, a shit ton of points.

780
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:08,360
Speaker 0: And it's like, they don't even know they're the outlier, they're voting along with everyone else, and it's like, yeah, they have really no control over that whatsoever.

781
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:12,400
Speaker 0: And they get a pile of points when everyone gets it wrong, which is the most likely outcome.

782
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,751
Speaker 0: I guess if everyone gets it right, then the outlier would be very unlikely to win.

783
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:19,740
Speaker 0: It's like, the whole winning and losing really hinges on that a lot.

784
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:38,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only thing I have to say in this game's favor, and why I liked it more than Fixie Text, which admittedly lobar, was that I noticed when we played it, everyone, even the people who were kind of quiet up to that point, talked and debated and, like, socially deducted openly.

785
01:01:39,122 --> 01:01:43,040
Speaker 1: Like, the game did encourage everyone to do that, and it happened.

786
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:53,020
Speaker 1: Whereas, remember that werewolf monster texting one, which is a similar deduction game, nobody really did that, and everyone just was kind of befuddled and staring at their phones.

787
01:01:53,781 --> 01:02:01,980
Speaker 0: That is a good point, is that a lot of social deduction games are all about, like, finding the traitor, or who's bad, or two opposing sides.

788
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:09,733
Speaker 0: Whereas here, this is like a co-op social deduction, like, we're all against the game together, PvE, right?

789
01:02:09,853 --> 01:02:13,720
Speaker 0: Team PvE computer, figuring out what those stupid categories are.

790
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:25,940
Speaker 1: Because, like, Scott and I are like, we're in the same category for sure, and then, like, three more people pile into our category, and we're 100% sure some of them are wrong, but trying to suss that out socially was an interesting problem.

791
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:28,440
Speaker 0: When they don't want to reveal their identities, either.

792
01:02:29,222 --> 01:02:36,140
Speaker 1: And now you're second-guessing, are the categories weird and I'm stupid, or is my friend, like, just wrong about this?

793
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:41,853
Speaker 0: Right, or it's like, you could just all reveal your identities, and the games would be really poor, you know, awful.

794
01:02:42,374 --> 01:02:44,560
Speaker 0: I'm sure some children do that, right?

795
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:47,798
Speaker 0: But if you play it in good faith, then, you know.

796
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:55,400
Speaker 0: But yeah, I can't, the thing is, even with all those, you know, aspects, I can't see playing this on purpose that much.

797
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:59,267
Speaker 1: I would consider playing it once with the right group of people.

798
01:02:59,388 --> 01:03:05,780
Speaker 1: Like, I would play it, if we're doing a Jackbox Night, it'd get thrown up on the screen once, but I don't think I would put Fixitex up on the screen.

799
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:18,500
Speaker 0: No, I think if I bought this pack, obviously TKO2 and TimeJinx are the ones getting a lot of play, and if you've got some new people there, you might play the other ones once each if they're curious.

800
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,791
Speaker 1: Or to demo the tech.

801
01:03:23,024 --> 01:03:26,099
Speaker 1: Fixitex has the least going for it as a game to play more than once.

802
01:03:27,621 --> 01:03:31,074
Speaker 0: But, is it worth it to pay the current price of $35 for this pack?

803
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,940
Speaker 1: You gotta be a Jackbox person, cause if you- You gotta be playing this a lot, right?

804
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:48,480
Speaker 0: If you own a bunch of other Jackbox games- Or it could be that you're having a party right now, and you really want to, and it's like, it's time, let's just fucking do it, so we can make a podcast about it.

805
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:55,758
Speaker 0: Then, yeah, okay, you'll pay $35 and maybe wish you, you know, we didn't do a podcast, you didn't have to do that, but-

806
01:03:56,821 --> 01:04:05,560
Speaker 1: I mean, you can be confident that me, Rim or Scott, will buy every Jackbox game that comes out and review it, unless they cross us in some way.

807
01:04:06,101 --> 01:04:15,620
Speaker 0: I'm confident that over time, it's gonna be a long time before TKO3 comes out, I'm gonna play TKO2 enough over time that I get my money's worth.

808
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:21,520
Speaker 0: But, you should probably wait for this to be inevitably discounted to $20 or something less than that, right?

809
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:27,300
Speaker 0: Unless you're just playing a lot of Jackbox all the time, or you're a streamer who does Jackbox, or some shit like that.

810
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,650
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

811
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:38,200
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening theme.

812
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:44,420
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCoup.com for show notes, discussion, links, and more.

813
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,592
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

814
01:04:47,893 --> 01:04:49,460
Speaker 1: Mondays are science and technology.

815
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,345
Speaker 1: Tuesdays, gaming and games.

816
01:04:51,466 --> 01:04:53,291
Speaker 1: Wednesdays are animation and comics.

817
01:04:53,612 --> 01:04:56,080
Speaker 1: Thursdays are arbitrary and indiscriminate.

818
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,620
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

819
01:05:02,121 --> 01:05:06,451
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

820
01:05:06,952 --> 01:05:10,400
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

821
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:41,840
Speaker 1: And there are many, many people who pay between zero dollars and one dollar or one euro, or I see one pound here as well, just to get access to, I assume.

822
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:42,385
Speaker 1: That's sweet.

823
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,580
Speaker 1: RSS feed.

824
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:44,941
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

825
01:05:45,582 --> 01:05:46,304
Speaker 1: I'm real hungry.

826
01:05:46,765 --> 01:05:47,406
Speaker 1: I'm home alone.

827
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:54,400
Speaker 1: Emily is in Rochester with the Switch, so I am in kind of goblin mode, so I gotta go cook something for myself right now.

828
01:05:54,560 --> 01:06:00,120
Speaker 1: I'm salivating, so I'm just gonna find something really lazy to post to the Stinger, and that's what you're gonna get.

829
01:06:00,262 --> 01:06:01,138
Speaker 1: Who are you?

830
01:06:02,106 --> 01:06:02,639
Speaker 1: I'm hungry.

831
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,144
Speaker 0: I, I don't know.

832
01:06:04,626 --> 01:06:05,730
Speaker 1: I don't really like labels.

833
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:08,280
Speaker 1: I'm just sort of like myself, you know?

834
01:06:09,043 --> 01:06:10,020
Speaker 1: Maybe he's simple.

835
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,210
Speaker 1: No, I'm just, I'm just lost.

836
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:15,240
Speaker 1: See, we're trying to get to... I'm the highwayman.

837
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:17,979
Speaker 1: Okay, good to know.

838
01:06:18,262 --> 01:06:20,733
Speaker 1: Well, so you see... I'm the highwayman.

839
01:06:21,695 --> 01:06:25,381
Speaker 1: I make ends meet, just like any man.

840
01:06:26,103 --> 01:06:27,385
Speaker 1: I work with my hands.

841
01:06:28,227 --> 01:06:29,409
Speaker 1: If you cross my path...

842
01:06:32,051 --> 01:06:38,642
Speaker 0: I'll knock you out, slide you off the road, steal your shoes from off your feet.

843
01:06:39,323 --> 01:06:43,490
Speaker 1: I'm the highwayman, and I make ends meet.
