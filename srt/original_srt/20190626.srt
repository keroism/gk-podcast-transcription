Speaker 1: Mm-hmm cuz I'm biking there.

26
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:34,540
Speaker 1: Anyway, I didn't go to this thing because you know, I worked at IBM.

Speaker 0: Okay, so But it's just food.

Speaker 0: and like sports Huge there's rides.

57
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,298
Speaker 0: There's food stalls like car rides.

58
00:02:57,921 --> 00:02:58,122
Speaker 1: Like.

59
00:02:58,423 --> 00:02:59,507
Speaker 1: it seems like it's what like.

60
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:05,679
Speaker 1: it's more like State Fair level, okay It seems like it's about as big as a State Fair.

61
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:08,870
Speaker 0: The state fairgrounds of New York State are enormous.

62
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,296
Speaker 1: It's not as big as the New York's Island.

63
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:15,720
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, yeah, then the Michigan State Fair fairgrounds were big but most of it was giant.

64
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,493
Speaker 0: You can probably fit several Randalls Islands in New York State.

65
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:19,839
Speaker 1: Giant fields filled with animals.

66
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,071
Speaker 0: New York State Fair is like a permanent town place.

67
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:23,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, like when we go to the Michigan State Fair.

68
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:28,320
Speaker 1: It's on a huge amount of land, but we don't really go to this tiny part of it.

69
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,713
Speaker 0: That's partially because it's far away from everything.

70
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:32,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, but think of thing I remember.

71
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:40,459
Speaker 1: actually as a kid we went we went to the State Fair once and on the way home The family agreed to never go to the State Fair again.

72
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:42,329
Speaker 1: There was not much going on.

73
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,380
Speaker 0: Connecticut didn't really, I don't know if Connecticut has this.

74
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,869
Speaker 1: That was way better.

75
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,557
Speaker 0: I don't know if Connecticut has a State Fair but they had a thing called the Big E that you could go to.

76
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:53,486
Speaker 1: I have no idea about that.

77
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:54,590
Speaker 0: It's like a big food deal.

78
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,500
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, so so you're going to the thing now.

79
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:00,840
Speaker 0: Was there like something announced at the thing that's suddenly worthy of going?

80
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:04,733
Speaker 1: So I saw the map of the thing like a concert with an amazing musician.

81
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:05,596
Speaker 1: There's like all this stuff.

82
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:06,540
Speaker 1: like it looks like a pretty big deal.

83
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,005
Speaker 1: It'll be fun.

84
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:14,360
Speaker 1: So, uh It's big enough to where when I had to go get my passes to the event in the office today.

85
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:24,960
Speaker 1: So I think like whatever and I stopped down there It's there's a giant booth like when you go to PAX to pick up your like speaker badges And I have to like go through a whole rigmarole.

86
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:34,840
Speaker 1: they give me these big PAX looking badges in a sealed envelope and It's like like I gotta bring all this ID and there's gonna be security checkpoints.

87
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:39,300
Speaker 1: And it's like I can bring one person and I have a special badge for them.

88
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,224
Speaker 1: They have to bring ID.

89
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:44,040
Speaker 1: the name on the ID has to match the name on this PAX looking badge in the sealed envelope.

90
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:48,255
Speaker 1: It's like it's it was way more security.

91
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:49,640
Speaker 0: Let's just forge that fucking shit.

92
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:50,652
Speaker 1: Yeah Sell them.

93
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:54,620
Speaker 1: So if you want to try to crash this party on Sunday, like good luck.

94
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:55,285
Speaker 0: I see the badge.

95
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:57,160
Speaker 0: so I can see if it's forged in the sealed envelope.

96
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:58,869
Speaker 0: So you can open the envelope now.

97
00:04:58,929 --> 00:04:59,914
Speaker 1: It's got a seal on it.

98
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:00,920
Speaker 0: open the envelope now.

99
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,600
Speaker 0: No, I'm not supposed to you had to open it there.

100
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,940
Speaker 1: I'm gonna bring the envelope there and show another badge and then use these badges.

101
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,824
Speaker 1: There's a whole thing.

102
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:10,652
Speaker 0: so you can't open the envelope in advance.

103
00:05:10,712 --> 00:05:11,295
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

104
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,380
Speaker 0: Otherwise that they're no good.

105
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:13,960
Speaker 0: So that's how they prevent.

106
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:23,324
Speaker 1: yeah, because apparently the thing is big enough and popular after where people try to like sell the badges on a Secondary market.

107
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:30,240
Speaker 0: I mean the fact I mean didn't even know this thing existed, but now it's like hey Let's try to get into other big companies picnics, right?

108
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,972
Speaker 1: I want to find out where credit are probably not as secure as yours.

109
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:36,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to go to like Credit Suisse's company.

110
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:39,460
Speaker 0: Suisse is like of all the companies in New York.

111
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:45,473
Speaker 0: They are like one of the tops in terms of pamper the employees Like every sports league in the city has.

112
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,800
Speaker 0: like a Credit Suisse team.

113
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:49,273
Speaker 1: I went to a lot of Mets games.

114
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:54,434
Speaker 0: Anytime you go to a thing There's always like a group of people wearing like Credit Suisse like shirts.

115
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:55,397
Speaker 0: There is a bike ride.

116
00:05:56,421 --> 00:06:01,235
Speaker 1: There's a past life where I saw many Mets games at Shea Stadium and luxury boxes.

117
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,100
Speaker 1: because of companies like Credit Suisse.

118
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I've actually been in their box.

119
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,060
Speaker 0: Maybe I should try to get a job.

120
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:08,803
Speaker 0: They're hiring.

121
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:09,989
Speaker 0: Maybe that's the purpose of them.

122
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,500
Speaker 0: doing all that shit is to try to get people to work there.

123
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:14,068
Speaker 1: I know for a fact they're hiring.

124
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:14,812
Speaker 0: They're always hiring.

125
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:16,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could get a job there anyone.

126
00:06:16,863 --> 00:06:17,748
Speaker 1: You'd make a lot of money.

127
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,579
Speaker 1: I don't know if you'd want to do that kind of work.

128
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,539
Speaker 0: Well, it depends how many hours I got to work.

129
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:24,332
Speaker 0: So that is how many of those special things like.

130
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:26,200
Speaker 1: so this whole like badge rigger mall.

131
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:29,010
Speaker 1: It's just like the least weird thing that happened to me today.

132
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:39,088
Speaker 1: Okay, so the second thing that happened on the way to work You know that shitty deli that basically or the bodega that basically just sells vapes The one right one right next to Queensborough Blot.

133
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:39,329
Speaker 1: Yeah.

134
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:41,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm walking to the subway to go to work.

135
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:48,528
Speaker 1: It's a lottery tickets and I see a guy who's like standing Outside of it like peering into the window.

136
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:50,835
Speaker 0: All right, there's always shady people in that area.

137
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:52,460
Speaker 1: and I noticed as I walked by.

138
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:53,651
Speaker 1: He has a gun.

139
00:06:53,671 --> 00:07:03,387
Speaker 1: All right He has a gun in a holster like kind of hidden but like not like an open carrier like check out my gun But a fucking like handgun.

140
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:07,060
Speaker 1: All right, so I don't like stop or react cuz I don't want to be involved in this.

141
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:16,100
Speaker 1: I keep walking and I just walk up to you know The viaduct like the bridge and then I kind of look over the corner to be like, so what's the deal with this?

142
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:24,279
Speaker 1: And the guy's just standing there peering into the bodega Like the shitty bodega selling the vapes and you can't see the gun from there, but he has a gun.

143
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,840
Speaker 1: I know he has a gun and I'm like, is he a plainclothes police officer?

144
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:32,180
Speaker 0: So I thought of just now because having a gun in New York City is not the easiest.

145
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:36,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if you have a gun legally you are either a problem or you're a cop.

146
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:43,798
Speaker 0: Yep So and these are not any nine percent chance of one of those teeth and these are not mutually exclusive.

147
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:44,520
Speaker 0: That is true.

148
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:47,428
Speaker 1: So that is not the weird part.

149
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:52,506
Speaker 1: All right, because I clearly like there was no police like there was no news of a shooting Or a robbery.

150
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:54,119
Speaker 1: so clearly yes, probably a cop.

151
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,780
Speaker 1: But while I look over the corner like from the bridge to be like what's going on should I call the cops?

152
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:04,195
Speaker 1: No, well if I give someone has a gun who is not a cop that is 100%.

153
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:04,897
Speaker 1: call the cop situation.

154
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:06,605
Speaker 0: You don't know.

155
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,731
Speaker 0: he's not a cop.

156
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,440
Speaker 0: if he pulls it out, then you couldn't call.

157
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:09,842
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

158
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,689
Speaker 1: if he pulls it out to like brandish it.

159
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:19,259
Speaker 1: Yes, then you can call or also you could call the cows and be Like yeah, so do you have a plainclothes officer like doing something here because there's a guy with a gun here?

160
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:23,833
Speaker 1: Gun like gun is a hundred percent cop situation some one way or the other.

161
00:08:23,873 --> 00:08:24,515
Speaker 1: but that is not.

162
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:28,276
Speaker 1: I ended up not calling the Cops because I look over the corner.

163
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:28,800
Speaker 1: I see him.

164
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,577
Speaker 1: He's still peering in the window doing this thing, but like 20 feet behind him where that bus stop is.

165
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:43,000
Speaker 1: There's a woman standing in an open suitcase Disrobing slowly and she's taking her clothes off and like some weirds going on.

166
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:47,580
Speaker 1: Okay, and I these two things are happening and I just think you know what?

167
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,597
Speaker 1: I ain't got time for this and I just kept walking and got on the subway and went to work.

168
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,120
Speaker 0: That's right.

169
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,072
Speaker 1: The third thing that happened to me was on my way home from work today.

170
00:08:56,092 --> 00:08:56,674
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

171
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,540
Speaker 1: So I'm just walking toward the subway.

172
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:09,517
Speaker 1: I have to stop at a light and there's much traffic going by and there's a dude standing there and His skin color looks wrong and weird to the point that I really had to resist doing a double take.

173
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:10,440
Speaker 0: He's got a skin condition.

174
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's.

175
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,070
Speaker 1: no no no that's so yeah, like.

176
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:25,520
Speaker 1: he has a pallor about him like death itself Mm-hmm, but and I would have just ignored that like so like that is not something I would talk about because people have skin conditions Whatever, but and I avoided doing a double take but I'm standing next to him and then I noticed something else.

177
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:28,112
Speaker 1: He is clearly wearing a fake mustache.

178
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:32,768
Speaker 1: Like I can see the plaster He's wearing a wig that's like glued to his head.

179
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,293
Speaker 1: Like I can see the little line.

180
00:09:34,313 --> 00:09:36,360
Speaker 1: I can see like the wig bits.

181
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:40,840
Speaker 0: All right, maybe it's like a you know, a practical joke or a setup for a video.

182
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:57,756
Speaker 1: All I'm saying is that basically the dude was like 100% wearing an elaborate disguise carrying a big briefcase and wearing a suit and like Elaborate disguise with like makeup because I could even see like his regular skin tone.

183
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:59,160
Speaker 1: Like I saw it could be a clown.

184
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:03,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, uh, all I don't know what he was up to but I like.

185
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:05,988
Speaker 1: maybe there's a film shoot Maybe it's a practical joke.

186
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:07,214
Speaker 1: Maybe he's a spy.

187
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:10,359
Speaker 1: Maybe he's about to rob a bank An actor at like a place or something.

188
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:19,407
Speaker 1: Maybe he's looking for the guy Who has the gun that he's gonna buy to go rob the bank and he showed up places in the city where someone would wear A costume on any given day.

189
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:20,130
Speaker 0: like is that weird?

190
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,235
Speaker 0: but Jekyll and Hyde restaurant.

191
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:22,080
Speaker 0: Is that still fucking there?

192
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,303
Speaker 1: I assume.

193
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:28,120
Speaker 0: I assume that place plenty of tourist traps or someone might wear a costume of any kind at any day.

194
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:31,519
Speaker 0: And if that person who works there goes home, it doesn't change, you know.

195
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,664
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just.

196
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:37,043
Speaker 1: it was very interesting to like look at someone and be like, well don't wanna don't want to call attention to That wait a minute.

197
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:38,608
Speaker 1: dude's wearing a costume.

198
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,494
Speaker 1: All right, it's makeup interesting.

199
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,678
Speaker 1: and then I went home and that was it.

200
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:44,189
Speaker 1: Three weird things that happened to me today.

201
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:46,680
Speaker 0: Wasn't the disrobing person weirder than the costume person?

202
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:52,637
Speaker 1: I mean it was but it was the the gun and then the disrobing person and then I just didn't care anymore.

203
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:53,299
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

204
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:55,739
Speaker 1: So, uh, what do you got in the news?

205
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,165
Speaker 0: So some comic news going on.

206
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:12,580
Speaker 0: obviously the big comic news that's going on is the vertigo comics Which is a long-standing and historic imprint of DC Comics Which if you don't know that means that basically vertigo comics is DC Comics.

207
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:20,685
Speaker 0: It's the same company the same, you know, whatever but it's like a separate department and when they print comics They put a different label on the side.

208
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:24,194
Speaker 0: and usually you would do this for two main reasons.

209
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:27,385
Speaker 0: number one to your internal Organization, right?

210
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:27,927
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

211
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:31,923
Speaker 0: We have a team of editors that makes these comics and we have a team of editors That makes those comics.

212
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:37,440
Speaker 0: We're all the same company, but they're focused on these properties and these people over here doing superheroes, right?

213
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,527
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, you know, they're separate teams.

214
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:43,380
Speaker 0: So we'll have separate, you know things going on, right?

215
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:47,075
Speaker 0: And the other reason is simply for the audience, right?

216
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:48,200
Speaker 0: So you go to the comic book store.

217
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
Speaker 1: You don't want someone to be like ooh Marvel and like wait, where's my spider-man, right?

218
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,139
Speaker 0: You see a cut you see a logo in the top corner the comic you're gonna buy and it says DC.

219
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,223
Speaker 0: So you're expecting.

220
00:11:56,464 --> 00:12:01,040
Speaker 0: well, that means this is in the DC Universe the Superman and Batman Wonder Woman, you know, right?

221
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:15,800
Speaker 0: but you know when it says vertigo in the top left that means ah this you know, you might whether you may or may not know as a Customer a reader that that's actually DC Comics, but you know, you know, well, this is not Superman Batman, whatever.

222
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,362
Speaker 0: This is.

223
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:21,980
Speaker 0: you know, Sandman Why the Last Man Fables is why it's one of those guys, right?

224
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:24,700
Speaker 0: So that's that's the reason imprints exist.

225
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:34,218
Speaker 0: So vertigo as I just said is printed many historic all-time great comics over the years Like vertigo was a go-to for the good stuff, right?

226
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:40,408
Speaker 0: 1993 it was formed right and You know burger was.

227
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:43,040
Speaker 0: she was the Karen burger Karen burger, right?

228
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,639
Speaker 0: She was the editor-in-chief of vertigo comics basically during all the great times and we did several news bits about

229
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:49,839
Speaker 1: her

230
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:59,980
Speaker 0: Leaving and then going to Dark Horse to start burger books, which I guess is an imprint at Dark Horse Yeah, but they've only printed like not too many burger books.

231
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:03,420
Speaker 0: It's like I feel like all those books they have came up with number ones.

232
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:06,071
Speaker 0: They should have been coming up monthly like two or three.

233
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:06,573
Speaker 0: They aren't.

234
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:11,374
Speaker 0: it's like you go and look at the website for it And it's like there's not really too many comics coming out over there.

235
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:12,479
Speaker 0: It's disappointing really now.

236
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,740
Speaker 1: She definitely knows what's up, though, because I know she's like the best she tweeted.

237
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,066
Speaker 1: She's actually right like after.

238
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:20,020
Speaker 1: this was now and she tweeted and what she said was not quoting her exactly.

239
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,910
Speaker 1: Corporate thinking and creative risk-taking don't mix.

240
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,291
Speaker 0: Yep.

241
00:13:23,492 --> 00:13:25,739
Speaker 1: DC nixing vertigo was a long time coming.

242
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:30,075
Speaker 0: Yep It was that was that that's the main news here is like they should have nixed it when she left.

243
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:34,290
Speaker 0: since she left vertigo has Been like this complete like nothing right?

244
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,140
Speaker 0: It's like they're reprinting the same nothings over and over again.

245
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:39,540
Speaker 0: They don't have new original content there.

246
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,340
Speaker 0: It's like I don't even understand why like I would open up the order form every month that I kept seeing vertigo there.

247
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,067
Speaker 0: And I'm like, why is vertigo still here?

248
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:48,070
Speaker 0: She left.

249
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:50,620
Speaker 0: They're not printing anything new or anything meaningful.

250
00:13:51,243 --> 00:13:52,108
Speaker 0: Why do they even exist?

251
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:53,032
Speaker 0: who's working there?

252
00:13:53,455 --> 00:13:54,460
Speaker 0: Why does it still exist?

253
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:59,295
Speaker 1: Also vertigo had a ton of scandals like one after another after she left.

254
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:00,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure.

255
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:02,214
Speaker 0: after she left Yeah, it was basically a shit show.

256
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:02,800
Speaker 0: Nothing, right?

257
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,429
Speaker 0: Well like in 2018 one of the people working on it had some sexual misconduct stuff.

258
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:11,945
Speaker 1: Some things got canceled.

259
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:12,929
Speaker 0: No surprises there.

260
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:15,216
Speaker 1: There was that issue with Batman's dick showing up.

261
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:16,320
Speaker 0: I didn't know about that.

262
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:17,589
Speaker 1: I'm gonna quote this to you.

263
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,240
Speaker 1: I think we talked about it on gig nights.

264
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:23,394
Speaker 1: DC has also struggled with public shock over mature content and comic books.

265
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:31,776
Speaker 1: in the fall of 2018 a quote production error that resulted in Batman's penis being visible in several panels of Batman damned number one.

266
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:33,950
Speaker 0: was that DC Comics or doesn't a vertigo?

267
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:48,920
Speaker 1: Yeah So this was DC having problems in general and the article seems to be implying that all of DC's scandals coupled with the issues with Vertigo meant that vertigo was just at best Baggage that could call even more attention to their problems.

268
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:52,187
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that's that just.

269
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:53,131
Speaker 0: it's finally done.

270
00:14:53,151 --> 00:15:01,395
Speaker 0: and but you know, I guess Symbolically a great era in comics is over and that's that's the thing.

271
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:03,560
Speaker 1: I'm just looking to see if I can find Batman's penis.

272
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:05,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, go find picture of Batman's dick.

273
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:06,251
Speaker 0: You want to see it, right?

274
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:11,807
Speaker 0: That's probably all black and twisty anyway So or sharp and pointy, I don't know.

275
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,019
Speaker 0: What finally happened is Neon Genesis Evangelion, what are the greatest TV?

276
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,592
Speaker 0: Animations of all time in human history that was ever created?

277
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:27,297
Speaker 1: you may like Ava you may not.

278
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:28,260
Speaker 1: you may think it's brilliant.

279
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,880
Speaker 0: It's once again legally available.

280
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:38,394
Speaker 1: It's it's always been illegally in the United States of America But it does not matter what you think the fact that we're still talking about it.

281
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:40,140
Speaker 1: It is really really important.

282
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:43,036
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's legally available once again in North America.

283
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,122
Speaker 0: Thanks to Netflix You keep.

284
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:44,947
Speaker 0: you have Netflix app.

285
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:45,954
Speaker 0: you can open it and watch it.

286
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:51,520
Speaker 0: I Expected when they announced this that the release on Netflix would be imperfect.

287
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,190
Speaker 0: There would be something to complain about.

288
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,940
Speaker 0: we already knew that they were doing a new dub.

289
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:56,880
Speaker 0: I assume that that dub would have issues.

290
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,479
Speaker 1: I assume the dub would be better than the first dub though.

291
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,260
Speaker 0: Well, yes that I mean but still not as good as because any adults from that era are not right great.

292
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,060
Speaker 0: I assume that something was going to happen where they would fuck it up.

293
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,846
Speaker 0: But still I did not expect.

294
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:15,638
Speaker 0: I still expected it to be not so fucked up that I would tell people Yeah, just pirate it don't watch the Netflix one.

295
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:19,059
Speaker 0: Yeah But no, they have somehow managed to fuck it up.

296
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:27,488
Speaker 0: Well, you know not surprisingly but like more than expected right here the list of fuck-ups that I'm aware of number one The script is fucked up right.

297
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:41,033
Speaker 0: the subtitle dub script itself has been changed severely in several ways in very meaningful ways That make it noticeably inferior Less gay less correct.

298
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:46,231
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there are various Discussions online about why exactly this is.

299
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,540
Speaker 0: some blame it on the Japanese some blame it.

300
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:51,791
Speaker 1: You know a student common theme I see is that it was that it was the jet.

301
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:57,967
Speaker 1: someone who has the reins on the licensing agreement in Japan Wanted the script to be changed.

302
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:01,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know anyway, so that's that's one who knows why.

303
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:07,040
Speaker 0: it's uncertain But regardless it is changed and the script on the ATV one is better, right?

304
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:20,238
Speaker 0: to The biggest most important change that they have fucked up is they did not get the rights to use the song Fly me to the moon in the closing of the episode.

305
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:26,614
Speaker 1: that That's like what initial D was released without the bitchin music.

306
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:37,439
Speaker 0: right if you do not know without eurobeat There's no initial D. when you watch an episode of Evangelion at the end of the episode There's a closer and the animation in the closer is always the same and the song is always the same.

307
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:48,140
Speaker 0: the song Is fly me to the moon by Frank Sinatra, but you know They never use the Frank Sinatra rendition is always a cover song and each episode has a different cover song.

308
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,050
Speaker 0: There are 26 cover while 24.

309
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,719
Speaker 0: I don't know if the last two have it.

310
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:55,220
Speaker 0: I don't know, but there are different covers for every single episode.

311
00:17:55,621 --> 00:18:03,110
Speaker 0: Some of them are only slightly different like I think like episode one and two are the same exact vocal track But like one has the strings and one doesn't.

312
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:08,695
Speaker 0: yeah, but there are still 20-something unique covers of the song.

313
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:09,459
Speaker 0: it's still a thing.

314
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,028
Speaker 1: It's a part of how you experience Evangelion.

315
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:16,604
Speaker 0: It is a significant thing even if you don't watch the full closer That comes.

316
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:29,528
Speaker 0: that song comes in at the end and is very meaningful and important To the show and in Japan they still included it, but in some other countries they did I think as well But not in the United States.

317
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:30,512
Speaker 0: they didn't pay whatever.

318
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:31,638
Speaker 0: they could have just paid the money.

319
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:32,643
Speaker 0: their Netflix Had the money.

320
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:36,460
Speaker 0: they chose not to considering how much they read for the license, right?

321
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,240
Speaker 0: There's some other song at the end and that's the main reason.

322
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,669
Speaker 0: I'll say just don't watch the Netflix one.

323
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:47,838
Speaker 0: or at least if you do go on YouTube There is a video that is literally all 20 whatever endings just in a row.

324
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:48,601
Speaker 1: now It's weird.

325
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:59,976
Speaker 1: this happens a lot with anime partly because the music licensing globally is completely fucked like it is Crazy hard to get global rights or to get rights sorted out across regions.

326
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:00,880
Speaker 0: just pay money.

327
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:03,778
Speaker 0: It's like it would make sense if it was a TV trying to do it.

328
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:09,999
Speaker 0: again I remember even if these doesn't even exist even if the East had that Oasis song and wasn't that speedgrapher?

329
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:13,759
Speaker 1: No speedgrapher also had a render and song.

330
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,080
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, they had girls on film right and even these had the Oasis song that was the official like proper opener.

331
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:29,139
Speaker 1: But then they changed it to this like generic j-pop song because they didn't even have the rights in Japan in perpetuity Mm-hmm just pay yeah, if you're gonna do it you gotta pay.

332
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:36,800
Speaker 1: So in a little bit of a gig bite Emily, and I we started watching the watership down Netflix animated series, right?

333
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,201
Speaker 0: That's like.

334
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:39,549
Speaker 0: it's not the original movie or whatever.

335
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,487
Speaker 0: It's a series, and it's 3d animated, okay I didn't even know this is a thing.

336
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:43,931
Speaker 1: Oh, it's.

337
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:44,334
Speaker 1: so it's.

338
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:45,160
Speaker 1: it's okay.

339
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:45,843
Speaker 0: Is it just?

340
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:48,091
Speaker 0: or is it just the same story telling book?

341
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:49,718
Speaker 1: yeah few tweaks few changes.

342
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:50,240
Speaker 0: read the book.

343
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:52,151
Speaker 1: Yeah, very it follows the book.

344
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:53,539
Speaker 1: few tweaks few changes.

345
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:55,406
Speaker 0: Cover the whole book.

346
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:58,140
Speaker 0: is it like a full thing or you got to wait for it to finish?

347
00:19:58,421 --> 00:19:59,044
Speaker 1: I mean, it's Netflix.

348
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,591
Speaker 1: they release everything all in one go full thing.

349
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:04,113
Speaker 0: so if you watch all of the things that they have put Up you're gonna get the whole book pretty much.

350
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:07,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay Not not many.

351
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:08,920
Speaker 0: oh, I mean it's not a long bug.

352
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:12,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, we watched the first one and what I want to say about it is it's pretty good.

353
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,914
Speaker 1: It's probably worth watching the voice acting and like.

354
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:15,859
Speaker 1: the script is great.

355
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:23,560
Speaker 1: The pacing is pretty good But the rabbit animation is pretty garbage Like they got a skim somewhere.

356
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,770
Speaker 0: I mean it seems like they're skimping somewhere on all this stuff.

357
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:33,850
Speaker 1: right skimp on not licensing the songs Skimp on the animations like the opening bid and the trailer and everything looks great, but then when you watch it They don't look like rabbits.

358
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,818
Speaker 1: They look like hairs like Like they look not like the way a rabbit would look.

359
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:41,676
Speaker 0: well They probably outsource the animation to like some foreign.

360
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:44,026
Speaker 0: You know place It wasn't doing research who knows.

361
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:50,000
Speaker 1: but beyond that the rabbits are drawn wrong like they have foot pads like their dogs And they don't act at all like rabbits.

362
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:57,160
Speaker 1: They move like someone who is vaguely familiar with how dogs and cats move and has never actually seen a rabbit before.

363
00:20:58,002 --> 00:21:04,760
Speaker 1: So they dig and move and act like dogs and cats kind of randomly like they're almost a puppycat sort of situation.

364
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,217
Speaker 1: but at no point do they actually look and act like the movements or the way a rabbit would move.

365
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:16,180
Speaker 1: and The backgrounds are great and like the scenery everything looks great except the rabbits themselves.

366
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:21,639
Speaker 1: they kind of look like cutscenes from a single a video game.

367
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:27,760
Speaker 0: speaking of Animals that are animated right the mouse guard movie.

368
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:31,234
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, was we all know this is already old news.

369
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:32,540
Speaker 0: is that it was gonna be a thing.

370
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:36,978
Speaker 0: They had a cast lined up They had all kinds of money the other sizzle reel which was like up.

371
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,480
Speaker 0: They had all kinds of stuff going on and then Disney bought Fox and then they canceled the mouse guard movie.

372
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:55,620
Speaker 0: So it never happened, but today Many people released many of the production materials For the mouse guard movie including this like I guess treatment of some kind where they use I think a video game engine.

373
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,080
Speaker 0: They used unreal turn unreal engine.

374
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:01,235
Speaker 1: It's hard to say unreal without saying tournament.

375
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:04,447
Speaker 1: if you were born Early enough to have played the early on real games.

376
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:10,025
Speaker 0: they use the unreal engine to create like this animated I guess short.

377
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:10,486
Speaker 0: that would.

378
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:13,958
Speaker 0: they would show to people to like convince them to invest in the mouse guard movie.

379
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:17,584
Speaker 0: and there's a big Disclaimer at the start of the video that's like hey We made this with unreal.

380
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:19,671
Speaker 0: the actual movie will look nothing like this.

381
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,080
Speaker 0: We'll send it off to weta to actually animate.

382
00:22:22,362 --> 00:22:26,225
Speaker 1: Yep, it's basically the movie was in pre-production But it had not entered.

383
00:22:26,285 --> 00:22:28,273
Speaker 0: principal photographer right as far as I know.

384
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:38,540
Speaker 0: like they had all these actors signed on like big You know big names like famous actors to be the voice actors But nobody recorded like a single line of dialogue or they didn't actually shoot anything for real.

385
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:44,519
Speaker 0: But they were getting close when they were canceled right there basically canceled as far along as like.

386
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:44,880
Speaker 0: like.

387
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:48,172
Speaker 0: We're all ready to actually do stuff and start spending all the money.

388
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:48,755
Speaker 0: Okay.

389
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:49,578
Speaker 0: Don't spend all the money.

390
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:54,102
Speaker 0: We're just kidding Yeah, right such a shame Preparation.

391
00:22:54,364 --> 00:22:59,995
Speaker 0: like you pack all your stuff to go on a trip and then you just Refund your plane tickets and your refund your hotel and you stay home.

392
00:23:00,136 --> 00:23:04,840
Speaker 1: You know I did that once I was flying to Chicago and the flight was delayed by a lot, and I just went to the Delta desk.

393
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,827
Speaker 1: I was like you know what fuck it.

394
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:07,640
Speaker 1: I'm just not going to Chicago give me a refund.

395
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,448
Speaker 0: Anyway, but the point is all the all the stuff has.

396
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:15,462
Speaker 0: all these materials of great interest have been you know released Onto.

397
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:17,917
Speaker 0: you know the Instagram accounts of you know people.

398
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:28,885
Speaker 1: yep I feel it is a shame because if you haven't read the mouse guard comics, which is sure they're fantastic And I feel like that story as a movie would have been fantastic I think it's just you know.

399
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:34,408
Speaker 0: I think the reason these materials is great because hopefully just bring some more attention to people to go Buy and read Mouse guard cuz.

400
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:52,025
Speaker 1: I can't say that that's what happened here But there's a long trend of whenever there's an executive shakeup or a merger and acquisition in TV or Hollywood of any kind what tends to happen is all the projects that were championed by the people who are no longer there Or from the company that was bought.

401
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:58,020
Speaker 1: get canceled because you can't have the people that you're getting rid of Have a thing that would have been successful.

402
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:03,700
Speaker 1: It's all like weird corporate politics that has nothing to do with the viability of the actual projects themselves.

403
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:05,984
Speaker 1: Get canceled.

404
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:08,575
Speaker 0: someone with a lot of money should just buy this.

405
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:09,700
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can buy it.

406
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,207
Speaker 0: I'll sell it to you for a pile.

407
00:24:11,428 --> 00:24:14,240
Speaker 1: I would sign on to executive produce, but I haven't cost.

408
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,113
Speaker 0: You know it cost millions, but Disney would.

409
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:17,119
Speaker 0: they're not gonna make it.

410
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,740
Speaker 0: They will definitely just give it to someone for millions of dollars.

411
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I if I was able to I would put money behind this.

412
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:25,872
Speaker 1: not all the money But like I would invest in this, but I am not.

413
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:29,178
Speaker 0: if you were another movie studio You could like trade something to Disney for it, right?

414
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,764
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's possible.

415
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:33,958
Speaker 1: trade you two marbles and this pre-tune gum I found.

416
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:47,298
Speaker 1: yeah but anyway, it's time for Things of the day, this is just a Twitter thread.

417
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,720
Speaker 1: I 100% believe that this happened as described.

418
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:55,334
Speaker 1: I've experienced a similar thing where I worked at a company.

419
00:24:55,354 --> 00:25:03,295
Speaker 0: this happened or not it doesn't matter because Even it like it might not have it like if this case one didn't happen.

420
00:25:03,455 --> 00:25:04,560
Speaker 1: this has still happened.

421
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:08,300
Speaker 0: This has happened many times basically or something close to it.

422
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,165
Speaker 1: The story is basically big.

423
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:17,367
Speaker 1: company hires a bunch of interns and the people who are supposed to give those interns work are Not good at their own jobs.

424
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:19,816
Speaker 1: Yes, so they give the interns like.

425
00:25:19,836 --> 00:25:21,000
Speaker 1: they don't understand computers.

426
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:29,693
Speaker 1: so they give the interns work that they think will take 12 weeks to do and Interns finish this work in 12 minutes by writing a Python script.

427
00:25:29,813 --> 00:25:33,206
Speaker 1: Yes, so now interns are like well What do you want me to do next?

428
00:25:33,347 --> 00:25:35,540
Speaker 1: and no one ever gives them anything to do mm-hmm?

429
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,411
Speaker 1: So this is the story of a hero.

430
00:25:38,491 --> 00:25:42,898
Speaker 0: right the company wants to have an internship program But they don't know how to like.

431
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:44,627
Speaker 0: give Continuously give people.

432
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:47,479
Speaker 0: I've had jobs from a full-time employee, and they can't give me work.

433
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:53,700
Speaker 1: I worked at a place in New York where I spent no interest in firing me or getting rid of me.

434
00:25:54,001 --> 00:26:00,665
Speaker 1: I was a full-time employee with full benefits getting paid for six months to do nothing Mm-hmm nothing.

435
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:05,398
Speaker 1: I would literally go to other project managers other bosses other departments.

436
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,490
Speaker 1: be like yo You want got some routers you want me to configure.

437
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,535
Speaker 1: you want me to do anything.

438
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:10,780
Speaker 1: any work now?

439
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,353
Speaker 1: Do you care if I just go to City Island like lay on the beach all day?

440
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,217
Speaker 1: No really okay?

441
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:19,060
Speaker 1: And eventually I quit cuz that's that'll drive you crazy.

442
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,733
Speaker 0: They will but you're happy several times.

443
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:23,260
Speaker 1: interns have even less to lose.

444
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,566
Speaker 0: It's so real.

445
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:31,728
Speaker 1: so the hero of this story this Twitter thread shows What to do in this situation.

446
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:35,180
Speaker 1: if you are a hero if you are a legend?

447
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,346
Speaker 1: And that's all I'm gonna say about it.

448
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:38,653
Speaker 1: It's not a long Twitter thread.

449
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:39,980
Speaker 1: Just read it alright.

450
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,370
Speaker 0: So here is some stop-motion animations for Wednesday.

451
00:26:43,611 --> 00:27:02,925
Speaker 0: right this person did a very clever stop-motion animation I guess the person is Daniel cloud campos and what they did is rather than use you know clay or action figures or I saw a great stop-motion animation at the LGBT animation thing.

452
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:04,289
Speaker 1: we I still can't find.

453
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:10,317
Speaker 0: I gotta find the list of pride animation where they used like you know crocheted characters rice and knitted.

454
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:13,856
Speaker 0: You know things for their their animation.

455
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:19,340
Speaker 0: anyway Instead of any of that they have used just a bunch of clothing on a floor.

456
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:23,140
Speaker 0: They bought a whole bunch of clothing, and they got the camera aimed at the ground.

457
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:29,460
Speaker 0: It looks like a wooden floor in some house, and they just lay the clothing flat on the floor and move it around.

458
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:36,360
Speaker 0: So it looks like you know people are moving, but obviously the it's just empty clothes with so looks like there's ghosts in them.

459
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:39,171
Speaker 1: I think what really makes it work is the hat like that hat.

460
00:27:39,332 --> 00:27:41,300
Speaker 0: well the hat lets you know that there's a head there right.

461
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:49,571
Speaker 0: It adds expression to the head movement because without the if you just had the suit with no hat You couldn't have any expression in the head area.

462
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:51,940
Speaker 0: It would only be expression of the arm and leg movement.

463
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:52,582
Speaker 0: Right.

464
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:56,335
Speaker 0: so you can see some of the characters that don't need head movement expression.

465
00:27:56,696 --> 00:27:57,840
Speaker 0: don't have a hat right.

466
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,191
Speaker 0: But see like that one has the hoodie.

467
00:27:59,332 --> 00:28:05,269
Speaker 0: yep, but anyway regardless This is a really awesome stop-motion animation.

468
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:06,895
Speaker 0: that is about what.

469
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:10,649
Speaker 0: four or five minutes long Yeah, and worth your four or five minutes.

470
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,700
Speaker 0: You're probably whatever you're gonna do with those four or five minutes.

471
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,102
Speaker 0: It's like what.

472
00:28:14,162 --> 00:28:14,845
Speaker 0: listen to geek nights.

473
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:18,080
Speaker 0: This is better than way use of your five minutes than listen to fucking geek nights.

474
00:28:18,461 --> 00:28:23,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in the meta moment the geek night's book club book was pages of pain.

475
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:25,452
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the thing I forgot to do.

476
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,639
Speaker 1: you didn't update the page.

477
00:28:27,302 --> 00:28:31,039
Speaker 1: So there might be a new book club book that we're about to read, but I don't know.

478
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:31,842
Speaker 0: It's.

479
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:38,460
Speaker 0: it's the tale of Genji the first novel ever created by human beings ever.

480
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:40,068
Speaker 0: Well one human being.

481
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:43,123
Speaker 1: yep, it's uh Historic.

482
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:43,906
Speaker 1: it'll be fun.

483
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:46,014
Speaker 1: There's no Emily Wilson translation of this.

484
00:28:46,074 --> 00:28:48,863
Speaker 1: we can't have the kind of fun we had with the Odyssey.

485
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:49,746
Speaker 0: no, but it is.

486
00:28:49,846 --> 00:29:02,806
Speaker 0: I'm still recommending the best possible translation according to my 20 minutes of research and that is the translation found in the penguin classics Deluxe unabridged edition.

487
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:06,640
Speaker 0: yep, not the non deluxe penguin classics because that one is abridged.

488
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:09,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't use abridged anything.

489
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:10,589
Speaker 0: That's right.

490
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:11,692
Speaker 0: No baby mode here.

491
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:13,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're playing you're playing Scrabble.

492
00:29:13,277 --> 00:29:14,140
Speaker 1: nope unabridged.

493
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:14,665
Speaker 1: Oh, Edie.

494
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:15,231
Speaker 1: Let's go.

495
00:29:15,535 --> 00:29:20,338
Speaker 1: That's right All right, and we got no conventions until packs.

496
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,765
Speaker 0: so X West Labor Day weekend is actually Surprisingly soon.

497
00:29:24,786 --> 00:29:31,257
Speaker 0: it is out to be July and then there's August and then there's bags Yep, and then after that eight weeks till pack.

498
00:29:31,377 --> 00:29:34,951
Speaker 1: after that There's a packs like every month and then mag fast and then more packs.

499
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:37,740
Speaker 0: also a new anime season should be starting very soon.

500
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,354
Speaker 0: We need to judge right about now, but apparently rim has to go to some crazy picnic.

501
00:29:41,575 --> 00:29:43,423
Speaker 1: Yeah, so a little judge Don't worry.

502
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:43,806
Speaker 1: Hmm.

503
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:48,559
Speaker 1: I actually got to go back and watch some of the anime We judged because I remember that a lot of it looked really good.

504
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,796
Speaker 0: I wanted to watch one punch man season two, but I couldn't find it anyway.

505
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,887
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

506
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:59,278
Speaker 1: So as you may recall Natasha Alegre put together this BN puppycat as a pilot.

507
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:06,300
Speaker 0: Yep It was like 2013 on YouTube on the Frederator channel, which I'm sure like how those organizations line up.

508
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:06,461
Speaker 0: like.

509
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:07,734
Speaker 0: what is the relationship between?

510
00:30:07,775 --> 00:30:16,227
Speaker 0: like Cartoon Network This was cartoon hangover venture time Frederator cartoon hangover like.

511
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,150
Speaker 0: what are all those?

512
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,220
Speaker 0: I don't understand how they're all what they all do differently.

513
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:24,720
Speaker 1: So it was really weird and cute and funny and the voice acting was great and everyone liked it.

514
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,060
Speaker 0: Like what's there's even bravest warriors and being puppycat, right?

515
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,949
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, there's two completely different saying.

516
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:30,692
Speaker 0: how are they connected?

517
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:32,280
Speaker 0: production wise company wise?

518
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:37,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is all discoverable by reading some of the things we'll link to but we're not gonna talk about all those details.

519
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,093
Speaker 0: Anyway, BN puppycat got put up there as a pilot.

520
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:40,717
Speaker 0: We watched it.

521
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:44,009
Speaker 0: It was amazing Yep, compared to all the other pilots they put up there.

522
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:47,360
Speaker 0: It was probably the best one after bravest warriors.

523
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:50,653
Speaker 0: I mean we could better than that dolphin president guy, whatever.

524
00:30:50,914 --> 00:30:55,599
Speaker 1: It's it's notable when I think back We actually quote BN puppycat kind of a lot.

525
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:59,230
Speaker 0: It's not too many quotes, but the quote you took too long.

526
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,855
Speaker 1: Now, you know something's gone.

527
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:02,440
Speaker 0: That's pretty much as what happened.

528
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,111
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the only one now whenever I'm feeling a little bargaining.

529
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:07,280
Speaker 1: I tend to do my guts my guts.

530
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:08,654
Speaker 1: Anyway, I tend to say that.

531
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:11,224
Speaker 0: so It was really cool.

532
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:14,014
Speaker 0: And then they did a Kickstarter to produce all the episodes.

533
00:31:14,114 --> 00:31:15,640
Speaker 0: Yep, and I gave money to that Kickstarter.

534
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember going to the launch party and that was a good time and then there was a bunch of drama.

535
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,580
Speaker 0: Because like they're making episodes, but the way they distributed the episode Well, the production was like delayed which is fine.

536
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,473
Speaker 0: That's what I expect from like a cartoon that's not on TV or anything, right?

537
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:30,900
Speaker 0: I didn't expect it to be out really quickly.

538
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,443
Speaker 0: I was patient.

539
00:31:32,086 --> 00:31:33,735
Speaker 0: There's even an official comic book by the way.

540
00:31:33,836 --> 00:31:36,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, but The production took a long time.

541
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:38,316
Speaker 0: delays, whatever not a big deal.

542
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:39,020
Speaker 0: I'm okay with that.

543
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,105
Speaker 0: I'll just wait till it's all done.

544
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:43,039
Speaker 1: But unless you like TV there was no way to watch it.

545
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,205
Speaker 0: Well, they put out the episode.

546
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:45,592
Speaker 0: I don't think was on TV TV.

547
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:49,409
Speaker 0: They put out the episodes Sporadically, right which is that it's like.

548
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,420
Speaker 0: I don't care if I had to wait a year two years.

549
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,554
Speaker 0: Just put them out, you know on a consistent thing so I can write.

550
00:31:54,855 --> 00:31:55,980
Speaker 0: but they put out like one or two.

551
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:59,240
Speaker 0: Then there's a big gap and then they weren't on YouTube.

552
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:06,333
Speaker 0: They put him on like some VRV or some kind of other site or something And I wasn't gonna sign up for that weird ass other side.

553
00:32:06,373 --> 00:32:09,580
Speaker 1: and then Bravest Warriors got moved there And it kind of fell off the radar.

554
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:10,585
Speaker 1: So basically

555
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:24,338
Speaker 0: because they put it on a weird site, even though I had kick-started it It was like a huge pain to watch even if I tried and then I found I knew that it was like done Ish at least the first season but it was just too much of a hassle to find it all.

556
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,307
Speaker 0: so I didn't Like one or two episodes.

557
00:32:27,387 --> 00:32:32,340
Speaker 1: of most people who have seen it have only seen the pilot and then the first four episodes.

558
00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:33,739
Speaker 0: I think that's what I had seen.

559
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the first of our episodes are the food one the creepy farmer one.

560
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:39,379
Speaker 1: The one true is the beach.

561
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:42,628
Speaker 1: Right the beach one is very like I like the other.

562
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:46,180
Speaker 0: the beach one is is the the the pretty Patrick, right?

563
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:46,801
Speaker 0: I remember.

564
00:32:46,822 --> 00:32:56,580
Speaker 0: that's basically what I remember is getting up to pretty Patrick and then not seeing anything after and then like a few people Seeing the cats one where she becomes the pet of that bathhouse of giving me spirited away.

565
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,104
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh my.

566
00:32:58,305 --> 00:33:04,140
Speaker 1: and then pretty much no one was able to see the rest of them unless they backed it on Kickstarter.

567
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:05,710
Speaker 0: I did back it on Kickstarter.

568
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could have watched two more episodes.

569
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,639
Speaker 0: You sure I could have but anyway the point and then there were more for more that you basically just couldn't watch.

570
00:33:13,343 --> 00:33:19,875
Speaker 0: Anyway, but the point is now or at least as of not super recently But relatively recently as of December 1st of 2018, right?

571
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,478
Speaker 0: So not so like a half a year ago.

572
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:30,400
Speaker 0: It was all on YouTube in a single video all ten episodes an hour long effectively a movie Right an hour long movie.

573
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:37,419
Speaker 0: They just squished all the ten episodes back to back to back and you get anyone who was YouTube so everyone could just watch it.

574
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,948
Speaker 0: Yep, and we finally got around to doing that.

575
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:42,437
Speaker 1: I'm hearing tell that this YouTube video is blocked in Europe.

576
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:43,380
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

577
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:46,499
Speaker 0: I'm gonna find out right there another place in Europe to watch it.

578
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,532
Speaker 1: That's one of the stream just said that there's no way to watch this stuff in Europe.

579
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:51,360
Speaker 0: All right, that is interesting.

580
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sad.

581
00:33:52,265 --> 00:33:54,217
Speaker 0: So I'm sure it is piratable.

582
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:54,640
Speaker 0: regardless.

583
00:33:54,801 --> 00:34:00,300
Speaker 0: We're gonna review being puppycat because there are ten episodes in order to crank out an easy Wednesday episode.

584
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:06,960
Speaker 1: I spent one hour watching it and there we go Yep, so we'll avoid spoilers to the end because there are actually things to spoil.

585
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:09,114
Speaker 0: I didn't think there would be but I guess there are.

586
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:40,232
Speaker 1: uh Being puppycat is really interesting because after the like pilot like there is a consistent Surreal nature to the show that continues all the way through to episode 10 and I really appreciate that not in the way that like bravest warriors is surreal and like It skips around a lot and never really gives you any context but more in the way like it's very dreamlike And it like it's very inconsistent in that It's hard to tell what's important or like where the show's getting bravest.

587
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:40,513
Speaker 0: right.

588
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:48,538
Speaker 0: bravest warriors is is Sort of that like we're showing you literally crazy shit, and you're begging for explanation.

589
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,591
Speaker 0: like yep I need to understand where this time Lord guy.

590
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:55,710
Speaker 0: He's actually the character for the future I guess but that's not a full explanation.

591
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:57,600
Speaker 0: What's up with the horse, right?

592
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:08,071
Speaker 0: They show you the crazy shit literally happening and you need it explained and being puppycat this weird shit Happening, but there aren't really too many questions.

593
00:35:08,111 --> 00:35:08,191
Speaker 0: like.

594
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:11,001
Speaker 0: you're not asking too many questions of this show the only questions You know.

595
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,968
Speaker 1: what I was asking is where.

596
00:35:13,088 --> 00:35:14,795
Speaker 1: what is puppycat right?

597
00:35:14,855 --> 00:35:16,160
Speaker 0: What's what is puppycat?

598
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,688
Speaker 1: Is he the pirate dude or not?

599
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,699
Speaker 1: pretty sure he is yeah or related to the right?

600
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,639
Speaker 1: I feel like it's not gonna be that straight forward, right?

601
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,944
Speaker 0: What's the deal with this?

602
00:35:25,004 --> 00:35:28,656
Speaker 0: others how they get to space and do things and get money.

603
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:29,740
Speaker 0: yeah like u.s.

604
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,511
Speaker 0: Early I guess America Island money.

605
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:33,937
Speaker 0: wherever they are they live on an island.

606
00:35:34,017 --> 00:35:38,236
Speaker 0: whatever money They get is clearly like usable right, but they get it from a TV.

607
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:39,200
Speaker 0: like and is you know?

608
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,920
Speaker 1: What's the explanation of that setting and that setting like that TV and the temp job?

609
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:44,483
Speaker 1: She does.

610
00:35:44,825 --> 00:35:50,422
Speaker 0: there is 10, but 10 bot has deeply disturbing Undertones.

611
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:57,800
Speaker 1: yeah once the incinerator everybody not just that but like all the jobs are really really broken fucked up things.

612
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:02,148
Speaker 0: Well it's also the jobs aren't Explicitly just like there's no task.

613
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:08,055
Speaker 0: It's like go to this place do your job, and it's like What do I do there like it doesn't matter if you succeed right.

614
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:09,080
Speaker 0: sometimes when they get there?

615
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,045
Speaker 0: Someone will tell them what to do because they've.

616
00:36:11,326 --> 00:36:14,255
Speaker 1: they're hiring a temp, but oh apparently the video.

617
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:17,384
Speaker 1: We just were we watched is Viewable in Europe.

618
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:20,937
Speaker 1: so there we go okay, so now this person is able to watch it for the first time.

619
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:21,599
Speaker 0: there you go.

620
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:23,653
Speaker 0: Congratulations Europe good job.

621
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:31,735
Speaker 1: I'm happy for you But the jobs are well, it's sort of like imagine Terrible secret of space intergalactic temp jobs.

622
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:34,609
Speaker 1: meaning these are jobs No one actually wants to do right.

623
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:40,620
Speaker 0: so some people just in space Must put jobs they need done into this temp agency like this.

624
00:36:40,841 --> 00:36:44,553
Speaker 1: I'm a creepy farmer who needs to murder someone when someone come and be murdered.

625
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:49,828
Speaker 0: so they put the jobs in and this robot Hires the cat wearing a bell.

626
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:54,060
Speaker 0: it sends a letter to get it to come to space and do the job and play.

627
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:54,542
Speaker 1: That's it.

628
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:55,427
Speaker 1: We don't know how.

629
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,257
Speaker 1: where puppycat really came from.

630
00:36:57,277 --> 00:37:00,713
Speaker 0: yeah We assume puppy cats the space prince from the pilot.

631
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:07,579
Speaker 1: and puppy cat is apparently tasked with these temp jobs and has been ignoring them I guess or Apparently has been doing well.

632
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,123
Speaker 0: I mean if you can.

633
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:08,264
Speaker 0: just.

634
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:12,607
Speaker 0: it seems like they can just choose like when they want to do when they can do one And if they don't they don't have to.

635
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,190
Speaker 0: there's like a million.

636
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,859
Speaker 0: they can just whenever they want do attempt job.

637
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:21,009
Speaker 0: Well base someone else I guess is also doing temp jobs You know with the same policy based on.

638
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:23,899
Speaker 1: you ever see anyone else doing based on the events of the one?

639
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,120
Speaker 1: where?

640
00:37:24,963 --> 00:37:27,331
Speaker 1: Does all the side quests to destroy the eye in the sky?

641
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:32,237
Speaker 0: puppycat had been doing these previously yes And I guess other people might also be doing them.

642
00:37:32,378 --> 00:37:38,479
Speaker 1: yeah I. What's interesting though is that a lot of these jobs seem like they would have ended in the death of the person who did them.

643
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:47,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you actually do them and it was interesting that be continued to survive these jobs So there's that.

644
00:37:48,108 --> 00:38:02,848
Speaker 1: but so there's like this surreal and Sinister like undertones everywhere coupled with a Very vague setting a very dreamlike setting right it's like they're in this island Which is somewhat Western society.

645
00:38:02,968 --> 00:38:15,666
Speaker 1: ish right and there's people doing people stuff And it's all seems pretty normal except for you look at like all this weird stuff like the kid is literally her landlord And that seems a little weird.

646
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:17,633
Speaker 1: yeah, but it's kind of working.

647
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:19,860
Speaker 0: the puppycat that speaks of the Vocaloid voice.

648
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,158
Speaker 1: Understand puppycat except be but at the same time the crab that talks.

649
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:28,554
Speaker 1: yeah But only puppycat can understand that grab cleavage like but it's.

650
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:30,100
Speaker 1: but it's not just that crab cuz.

651
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,613
Speaker 1: look there's the bird and there's the bug and puppycat understands them all.

652
00:38:33,774 --> 00:38:38,129
Speaker 1: yeah, no one else does and People think puppycat is weird.

653
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:40,380
Speaker 1: like this isn't an anime situation.

654
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,726
Speaker 1: We're like the weird stuff happens and everyone's cool with it.

655
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:51,252
Speaker 1: when the Deckard ends up joining be in one of these missions He's completely freaking out and can't deal with right, so that's what the thing is.

656
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:57,713
Speaker 0: it's like usually when you have a superhero Disguise situation or a transport to another world situation.

657
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,065
Speaker 0: It's either like name of eska flown It's like okay.

658
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:01,919
Speaker 0: We go to the other world and everything happens there.

659
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:04,627
Speaker 1: Yep, right But even eska flown I had those moments were like.

660
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:12,613
Speaker 1: that is weird because there's this one scene that to this day stands out to Me as being an unaddressed thing where her pager goes off.

661
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:21,005
Speaker 1: pager cuz you're 90s even though she's on But the pager goes off while she's in the fantasy world makes no sense And you're like no cell towers there And you're like what.

662
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:23,900
Speaker 1: and then a bunch of drama happens, and then you've kind of forget about it.

663
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:31,521
Speaker 1: But then at the end of the episode it just cuts back to earth And it just this dude is trying to call her on the phone Mm-hmm.

664
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:35,474
Speaker 1: so things like that don't happen in being puppycat.

665
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:37,540
Speaker 1: It's just right, but there's also right.

666
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:52,911
Speaker 0: But there's also when you have a secret super thing right cuz there's basically B is like a secret Superhero in a way and that like she you know or she goes and does like you know these other Semi heroic things with costumes and powers.

667
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:55,760
Speaker 1: I guess kind of she gets the powers from temp pot.

668
00:39:56,001 --> 00:39:57,708
Speaker 0: I guess so, but regardless.

669
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,860
Speaker 0: It's not like Superman where he's right there with all the people.

670
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:08,529
Speaker 0: She's not like doing all this shit in front of all the people like Deckard and whatever she like leaves Earth goes to a separate place and comes back.

671
00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:15,180
Speaker 0: so the only thing any earth people would notice is like mysterious Disappearance of B, and then she comes back, but she's not even trying to hide it.

672
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:23,091
Speaker 1: She just doesn't tell people yep, and she was also initially freaked out by it like this is not something She was aware of until puppycat like dragged her into it.

673
00:40:23,191 --> 00:40:27,869
Speaker 0: yep, so all those things together That makes it like a unique un unique thing.

674
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:29,857
Speaker 1: yeah, but all these factors together.

675
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:36,756
Speaker 1: Just make it a Really dreamlike surreal and interesting show to watch because I can't think of other things.

676
00:40:36,816 --> 00:40:48,959
Speaker 1: I've seen that are like it The clothes like the characters act and talk in a very adventure timey way yep And the backgrounds in the setting are very Steven University right it's like.

677
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:55,660
Speaker 0: B Is sort of you know wacky kooky sort of like a you know like a like a Jake or a tree trunk?

678
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,902
Speaker 1: Very important point.

679
00:40:56,963 --> 00:41:02,760
Speaker 0: if you watch this recording girl is much more grounded like a princess bubblegum is but even then she's got there.

680
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:10,289
Speaker 1: So there is weird surreal crap that everyone does know about like the whole wrestling subplot with her.

681
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:16,819
Speaker 1: like the world is weird and in the weird world B puppy and Puppycat are pulled into an even weirder world.

682
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,449
Speaker 1: The weirder world is very video game like.

683
00:41:21,172 --> 00:41:23,459
Speaker 0: yeah, there is actually a world that like is a video game.

684
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think most of the other worlds are parodies of things in a way.

685
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:31,948
Speaker 0: Yeah the one with the plant is Slightly little prince.

686
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:34,560
Speaker 0: ish in that it's like a tiny planet with things living on it.

687
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,365
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the other thing all the time.

688
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:37,348
Speaker 1: I quote the.

689
00:41:37,648 --> 00:41:38,531
Speaker 1: are you sad.

690
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:40,055
Speaker 1: Do you want a nap?

691
00:41:40,336 --> 00:41:41,800
Speaker 1: Do you want a snack?

692
00:41:42,482 --> 00:41:46,820
Speaker 0: anyway Though these the cat thing is clearly spirited away.

693
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know is a hundred percent spirited away.

694
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:49,992
Speaker 0: homage.

695
00:41:50,032 --> 00:41:54,439
Speaker 0: the video game one is just video game Right doing all the side quests yep

696
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:58,494
Speaker 1: But in terms of like the show itself and like why to watch it in Steve giant

697
00:41:58,534 --> 00:41:59,999
Speaker 0: kitchen in a ring thing

698
00:42:00,522 --> 00:42:08,743
Speaker 1: Aside from all the like fun surreal stuff and the plot bits We're not gonna talk about until the end because they're kind of spoilery and the show goes in directions You might not have expected.

699
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:17,960
Speaker 1: but the voice acting in the script is just really funny like Character way good be as a character is just really really really funny.

700
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:26,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, also that the you know like I said before the idea to use a vocaloid to voice puppycat is I think unique.

701
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:32,600
Speaker 0: I don't think any other character No one else has used it for voice usually use it just for music and they don't use it in a like normal consistent way.

702
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:42,541
Speaker 0: It's just really funny right and it's not overused or bad or awkward Sounding or anything like that and no one else is like, you know, if anyone else tried to do it would be like, ah Really?

703
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,740
Speaker 0: You're just gonna steal that idea, but it also gets saved the money on production.

704
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,880
Speaker 1: I have to hire an actor, but I guess what I would say is that piece of software all the weird stuff that happens.

705
00:42:51,880 --> 00:43:05,216
Speaker 1: you know we talk about this when we talk about shows like utana or even Evangelion to an extent where weird anime crap happens or weird nonsense happens and Like you as a viewer sort of excuse it as well.

706
00:43:05,276 --> 00:43:06,220
Speaker 1: This is just a cartoon.

707
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,080
Speaker 1: So weird stuff happens and then later the cartoons like no that stuff's weird, right?

708
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,946
Speaker 0: Like there's the kid who's a landlord and you're like, oh, okay, you know That's just a weird thing.

709
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:23,243
Speaker 0: and that the kid landlord and it's like nope Actually, the kid is forced to be the landlord because his mom is like some space princesses in a coma or something Like.

710
00:43:23,283 --> 00:43:27,440
Speaker 0: there's a serious real plot there by the way, that's the thing that happens in a real life.

711
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:36,164
Speaker 0: I read a story about a kid whose parents like something happened to them I forget if what it was but like he had to run the motel even though he was like a kid he ran it like His whole life.

712
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:37,395
Speaker 1: I remember I saw years ago.

713
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:38,040
Speaker 1: There was a movie.

714
00:43:38,525 --> 00:43:47,160
Speaker 1: It's a sort of dramatization but this happened in Japan where this woman just Left her three kids in the apartment and they just had to get by for a long time by themselves.

715
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:50,705
Speaker 1: And they did mostly but like one of them died.

716
00:43:50,725 --> 00:43:53,490
Speaker 1: it was a really tragic situation, but that does happen.

717
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,160
Speaker 1: and Being puppycat does that do ten a thing?

718
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,878
Speaker 1: You see this landlord like haha the kids a landlord that this is just a cartoon thing.

719
00:44:01,918 --> 00:44:03,464
Speaker 1: and then later It's like no that kids alone.

720
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:07,840
Speaker 1: That kid is alone eating candy and his mom is in a coma in the other room, right?

721
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,330
Speaker 0: He's fixing the toilet with like a weird hammer or whatever.

722
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,158
Speaker 0: It's like no he actually fixed the toilet.

723
00:44:12,178 --> 00:44:12,278
Speaker 0: Yeah.

724
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:20,668
Speaker 1: So what I would say is if you've not actually watched all this being puppycat as you watch it Pay attention to the weird stuff.

725
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:27,712
Speaker 1: and I'm not saying this is gonna be an Evangelion Montana not even good, but I'm saying there is a thread.

726
00:44:27,813 --> 00:44:29,016
Speaker 1: there are multiple threads.

727
00:44:29,497 --> 00:44:31,845
Speaker 1: There is a plot There is an under the undertones.

728
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:38,007
Speaker 1: You're you're feeling getting hints of they're real and there's a lot of Darker or more interesting stuff.

729
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:41,100
Speaker 1: that is pretty clearly foreshadowed if you're trying to look for it.

730
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,710
Speaker 0: There's quite a bit going on for an hour of animation.

731
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:47,345
Speaker 1: Yeah a lot more than you might have expected Mm-hmm.

732
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:53,871
Speaker 0: It's also like the human plot right of Deckard, you know, does he stay, you know Does he stay and take care of you know?

733
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,840
Speaker 0: is he likes being in the town?

734
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,158
Speaker 0: He likes the people in the town.

735
00:44:57,586 --> 00:45:02,834
Speaker 0: But he's you know He's giving up on his dream career of being a chef if he goes to the cooking school.

736
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:08,116
Speaker 1: and even without the more surreal stuff Like that's a pretty compelling not even like he's not even struggling to apply.

737
00:45:08,176 --> 00:45:09,040
Speaker 0: He got accepted.

738
00:45:09,161 --> 00:45:10,671
Speaker 0: He just has to send in the okay.

739
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:13,371
Speaker 1: I accept I'm coming Yep, and B has to struggle with.

740
00:45:13,452 --> 00:45:17,189
Speaker 1: I don't want to hold him back But at the same time I want him to stay cuz.

741
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,514
Speaker 1: I like him cuz.

742
00:45:18,534 --> 00:45:19,437
Speaker 1: I got him ice for his junk.

743
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:21,928
Speaker 1: that one time Yep, and it's just.

744
00:45:21,988 --> 00:45:24,097
Speaker 1: it's like now that I've seen a season of it.

745
00:45:24,117 --> 00:45:24,700
Speaker 1: That's complete.

746
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,627
Speaker 1: It's a really solid show and it's going somewhere.

747
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:28,088
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

748
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:38,800
Speaker 1: Like it's legit going somewhere based on the events of the last episode Mm-hmm, which before we get into spoiler territory The other thing I'll say is that if you didn't notice we even talked about this on geek nights.

749
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,458
Speaker 1: Cuz that happened last year.

750
00:45:41,462 --> 00:45:49,724
Speaker 1: Actually almost exactly one year ago It was announced that being puppycat is getting a second season Produced by Pokemons.

751
00:45:49,825 --> 00:45:50,426
Speaker 1: Oh LM.

752
00:45:50,687 --> 00:45:55,480
Speaker 1: Okay, like full-on production full half-hour episodes full season.

753
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,285
Speaker 0: How many emphasis?

754
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,339
Speaker 0: I don't remember these eggs?

755
00:45:59,502 --> 00:46:05,300
Speaker 1: I've Somewhere between 13 and 26, I think but it doesn't actually say but they are half-hour long episodes.

756
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:08,874
Speaker 1: The show is called being puppycat lazy in space.

757
00:46:09,256 --> 00:46:10,260
Speaker 1: It is season two.

758
00:46:10,421 --> 00:46:12,452
Speaker 1: It just picks up from where season one left off.

759
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:13,779
Speaker 0: So that sounds good.

760
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was Lee supposed to come out in 2019.

761
00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:17,713
Speaker 0: If you didn't notice it's 2019.

762
00:46:17,713 --> 00:46:19,520
Speaker 1: So they don't have a lot of time left.

763
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:20,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we'll see.

764
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:22,167
Speaker 1: but it's a like.

765
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:27,100
Speaker 1: this is a real-deal show and now is the time to watch being puppycat season one.

766
00:46:27,402 --> 00:46:29,400
Speaker 0: So wait until lazy in space actually comes out.

767
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,395
Speaker 0: Then you can just be like whoosh.

768
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,311
Speaker 1: Thing is if you watch being puppycat season one kind of like.

769
00:46:33,351 --> 00:46:41,617
Speaker 1: when I first got into a ten of the anime I saw like the first few episodes and I was like, yeah, this show seems generic and not good like.

770
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,280
Speaker 1: I'll watch it later Maybe I don't care.

771
00:46:44,482 --> 00:46:52,636
Speaker 1: But then I saw a couple of random episodes from later in the show and I was like, oh it's going somewhere It's going somewhere.

772
00:46:52,697 --> 00:46:59,620
Speaker 1: good I gotta figure out how the show I saw one episode of gets to this other episode that I saw.

773
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:05,260
Speaker 1: So if you're on the fence about this show watch this YouTube video cuz we gotta be on the fence about a show.

774
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,945
Speaker 0: It's an hour long.

775
00:47:06,025 --> 00:47:13,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's an hour of cartoons and At the end while you're eating dinner like I did and then you when you're done eating dinner go back to playing video games.

776
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, uh, if you didn't watch it yet like spoilers spoilers spoiler because we're gonna talk about it.

777
00:47:18,861 --> 00:47:20,024
Speaker 1: We're going to spoil the.

778
00:47:20,325 --> 00:47:20,947
Speaker 1: the secret.

779
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:23,234
Speaker 0: There's only once the thing about the secret.

780
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:25,060
Speaker 0: right is pretty much only one secret in the whole.

781
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:26,765
Speaker 1: It's really foreshadowed.

782
00:47:26,906 --> 00:47:29,273
Speaker 1: every episode has a bunch of clues.

783
00:47:29,374 --> 00:47:33,427
Speaker 0: it is heavily foreshadowed but Unlike other things right?

784
00:47:33,468 --> 00:47:36,278
Speaker 0: For example, when you're what you watch a show there's questions.

785
00:47:36,298 --> 00:47:43,300
Speaker 0: you're asking Yeah, like there's mysteries presented to the audience and the audience is like I want it that explained.

786
00:47:43,742 --> 00:47:44,826
Speaker 0: How is it tenable?

787
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:45,689
Speaker 0: keep going with utenna?

788
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, how does that elevator work?

789
00:47:47,355 --> 00:47:48,560
Speaker 0: Yep, how these rings work?

790
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,468
Speaker 0: Who's the end of the world?

791
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:50,640
Speaker 1: What's in that castle?

792
00:47:51,344 --> 00:47:52,834
Speaker 1: Later the horse is gonna come.

793
00:47:52,894 --> 00:47:53,800
Speaker 0: what is up with that, right?

794
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:59,460
Speaker 0: You're kind of showing you stuff and not explaining it and you ask about it being puppycat this one main mystery.

795
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,347
Speaker 0: You never ask about it.

796
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:02,913
Speaker 0: They foreshadow it heavily.

797
00:48:03,053 --> 00:48:04,840
Speaker 0: It's not like some thing that doesn't make any.

798
00:48:05,322 --> 00:48:10,280
Speaker 0: Let's back up a little bit with utenna, but you're never asking this question because they're not you know.

799
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,916
Speaker 0: You're asking instead about puppy guys puppy cats the weird thing.

800
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:13,560
Speaker 0: that's unexplained.

801
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:19,289
Speaker 1: So with utenna when you watch the show the first time as you may recall from a rotenna series We're talking about this in detail.

802
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:21,303
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of questions You're asking.

803
00:48:21,945 --> 00:48:26,920
Speaker 1: later in the show the show turns it around and says yeah Here's a question.

804
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:32,940
Speaker 1: You weren't asking that you should have been and then it like in it like doubles down on the stuff.

805
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,653
Speaker 1: You weren't thinking about being puppycat kind of does that?

806
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:36,879
Speaker 1: you weren't asking about B?

807
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,190
Speaker 0: You're right asking about puppy cat.

808
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,300
Speaker 0: cuz puppy cat is unexplained.

809
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:45,396
Speaker 0: It's a puppy and a cat and it talks and it came from space and it does mission Kind of like a Escaflowne though like a man.

810
00:48:45,437 --> 00:48:48,871
Speaker 1: like Escaflowne is about a normal girl like it's transported to a magical world.

811
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:51,340
Speaker 1: All your questions are about the magical world.

812
00:48:51,581 --> 00:48:52,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you're not like.

813
00:48:52,711 --> 00:48:53,680
Speaker 1: what's Hitomi's deal?

814
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,380
Speaker 1: Like she's just a girl who like got caught up in magic gem.

815
00:48:56,882 --> 00:49:09,224
Speaker 1: But then at the end of the show Escaflowne even without spoiling anything goes back and like yeah You probably should have been asking about why this one particular girl anyway, so Spoilers.

816
00:49:09,304 --> 00:49:17,580
Speaker 0: Isaac Newton said so right you're not asking about B. Everything about B is relatively explained throughout the course of the show, right?

817
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:24,140
Speaker 0: She's a lazy not so good at too many things girl who's kind of kooky and crazy.

818
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,916
Speaker 0: So you can understand how come she can't hold a job or take care of herself.

819
00:49:26,957 --> 00:49:31,100
Speaker 0: that well Yeah, she had a dad but the dad is dead or missing or something.

820
00:49:31,883 --> 00:49:34,513
Speaker 0: You don't know anything about her mom, but I mean that's just RPGs.

821
00:49:34,614 --> 00:49:35,317
Speaker 0: There's no mom.

822
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:39,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, right You know, she lives alone in this town.

823
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:42,380
Speaker 1: She's does friend, but it's a clever misdirection of right.

824
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:42,802
Speaker 0: It's like.

825
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:43,224
Speaker 0: it's like.

826
00:49:43,324 --> 00:49:46,417
Speaker 0: okay, you know, we know we can see what her deal is, right?

827
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:54,080
Speaker 0: But you know, we're not like, you know There are some things in there that you could get more information about like what exactly happened to the dad.

828
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,003
Speaker 0: Where is mom?

829
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:55,404
Speaker 0: is there?

830
00:49:55,524 --> 00:50:03,655
Speaker 0: right, but you know, you're not deeply asking about those because they're not terrible secrets of space They're just you know, sort of just general things.

831
00:50:03,715 --> 00:50:08,640
Speaker 0: They're they're fine You're okay with just going with it, but I do it's often done.

832
00:50:08,721 --> 00:50:21,537
Speaker 1: Well, like a lot of the good media I've thought of like Utena and Eska Flon are both examples where the question you weren't asking ends up being very Interesting and then in retrospect you realize additional things about the show right because I was going back through the show.

833
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:26,910
Speaker 1: after the revelation I noticed like one Her house is really weird like really weird.

834
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:30,020
Speaker 1: other people's houses in the show are not that weird.

835
00:50:30,942 --> 00:50:37,018
Speaker 1: there's a lot of weird computer crap and The dead box and all those things that all makes sense.

836
00:50:37,078 --> 00:50:40,900
Speaker 1: now She's repeatedly like she's very afraid of getting wet.

837
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:43,226
Speaker 1: That makes a lot of sense now.

838
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:46,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's really really strong like a co strong.

839
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:48,066
Speaker 0: Yep, that was.

840
00:50:48,569 --> 00:50:50,119
Speaker 1: I didn't even think anything about that head.

841
00:50:50,362 --> 00:50:51,884
Speaker 0: No I barely even noticed it.

842
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:57,620
Speaker 0: the first thing is that at the beginning of the earliest episodes they talk about her like not growing up.

843
00:50:57,964 --> 00:51:00,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Literally, right.

844
00:51:00,466 --> 00:51:01,028
Speaker 0: and I was like.

845
00:51:01,048 --> 00:51:04,580
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, I think she literally she must have some kind of thing.

846
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:06,171
Speaker 0: She literally doesn't grow up, but it's like.

847
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:08,043
Speaker 0: I didn't care about it too much But I did.

848
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:11,360
Speaker 0: I did notice it and the first I didn't notice it like in retrospect.

849
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,300
Speaker 0: It was clever because it's it right away.

850
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:25,081
Speaker 1: She's kind of a weird loser who is not growing up and like maybe we'll hold back other people who are growing up But in the sense of growing up to become an adult not in the sense of she is not physically changing and that's weird Right.

851
00:51:25,121 --> 00:51:33,651
Speaker 0: I think I think I got the impression even on the first go that she was not literally not growing up But I didn't really care too much about why or whatever.

852
00:51:33,952 --> 00:51:38,929
Speaker 1: and then like she understands puppycat But no one else does makes a little more sense.

853
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,756
Speaker 1: Maybe depending on what puppycat is.

854
00:51:40,776 --> 00:51:40,836
Speaker 1: Yep.

855
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:50,039
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway The dad box which you discover like the only show with you like one time on in the birthday episode.

856
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:51,947
Speaker 1: Yep Which is like the birthday episode.

857
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:53,634
Speaker 0: It's like my dad made me this box.

858
00:51:53,674 --> 00:51:55,040
Speaker 0: you learn about the dad every year.

859
00:51:55,141 --> 00:51:56,700
Speaker 1: It gives me a piece of candy and you learn.

860
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:06,325
Speaker 0: Okay, dad was clearly some guy who was like Technological cuz he made like this whole arcade full of awesome games and her house is full of like old weird real to real Looking mainframe computer.

861
00:52:06,345 --> 00:52:10,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like her dresser or something her closet like is a mainframe thing.

862
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,484
Speaker 0: She opens it and right.

863
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:15,740
Speaker 1: Yep, but it's like when she when she cries her tears like are weird.

864
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:23,772
Speaker 1: Mmm, I just clicked on I saw a frame and I remembered that like she cries at one point and it zooms in and the tear Like falls to the ground and shatters.

865
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,087
Speaker 0: Mmm Isn't that?

866
00:52:26,147 --> 00:52:37,203
Speaker 0: I thought that was cold, uh Well, maybe maybe anyway Looks a lot like the bits that come out of dad box like on her birthday gives her like this candy and she just shares It whatever.

867
00:52:37,223 --> 00:52:42,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like oh the you know, the dad was clearly some sciency, dude he made an arcade and he made this other stuff.

868
00:52:43,097 --> 00:52:49,920
Speaker 0: and then At the end of the show when they reveal the spoiler that she's actually like some kind of robot.

869
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:54,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, like she's small wonder it's that like she's the small wonder girl, right like straight up.

870
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:55,784
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

871
00:52:55,984 --> 00:52:56,285
Speaker 0: it's like.

872
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:57,630
Speaker 0: oh that makes perfect sense.

873
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:03,760
Speaker 0: I wasn't asking but now that you told me the answer Yes, I can see that that is absolutely makes perfect sense.

874
00:53:04,021 --> 00:53:08,333
Speaker 1: Well, so this is way back when I was like there is no mom.

875
00:53:08,373 --> 00:53:10,720
Speaker 0: The dad was a solo dude who made a robot girl.

876
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:19,786
Speaker 1: I don't remember the fullness of this conversation but I was actually at the launch party talking to Natasha about the show like we're just hanging out and She said something.

877
00:53:19,887 --> 00:53:33,181
Speaker 1: she referenced small wonder in casual conversation Mm-hmm and that in retrospect makes sense in the context of being puppycat because she's just like this girl, but yep I like.

878
00:53:33,201 --> 00:53:39,423
Speaker 1: and it also makes sense now because you like I love that scene the scene where it's revealed because you just hear that like Chunking.

879
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:41,800
Speaker 0: no, she has all these weird dreams, right?

880
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:46,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the dreams and whenever she gets caught like ribbons come out of her and it seemed like a rule, right?

881
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,410
Speaker 0: I thought it was like a dream thing when it happened.

882
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:53,300
Speaker 0: It's like no that's what happens if she actually She's literally made of like these weird components.

883
00:53:53,621 --> 00:54:02,615
Speaker 1: But just like you hear that chunk and she like makes a weird look and then the ribbons come out of the black hole Then she pull her hands pulls her hands out and they're just mangled.

884
00:54:02,635 --> 00:54:10,640
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and Deckard sees it like that secret is out now and Deckard is freaked out by it And then they don't actually see each other again in season one.

885
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,446
Speaker 1: But he's not that freaked out because he wrote her that letter.

886
00:54:13,486 --> 00:54:14,087
Speaker 1: He made like.

887
00:54:14,107 --> 00:54:15,750
Speaker 1: he wants to say something to her.

888
00:54:15,971 --> 00:54:16,151
Speaker 0: Yep.

889
00:54:17,314 --> 00:54:24,296
Speaker 1: I The princess girl and the kid and the jellyfish story.

890
00:54:24,316 --> 00:54:30,640
Speaker 1: that is Clearly similar to the space pirate story who may or may not be puppycat.

891
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:33,224
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm hoping that you know It's like the.

892
00:54:33,405 --> 00:54:37,800
Speaker 0: the second season focuses on the mystery of puppy because that's the question I actually am asking right?

893
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:44,659
Speaker 1: It's like I really want to know what's up with her dad Is B and her dad and like he's just a dude who made a robot but why did he make her what for once?

894
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:45,605
Speaker 0: He was lonely.

895
00:54:45,888 --> 00:54:48,383
Speaker 1: I feel like that's gonna be a Boy right.

896
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:51,395
Speaker 1: come on it might be it might be Astro boy.

897
00:54:51,415 --> 00:54:52,198
Speaker 0: She's Astro boy.

898
00:54:52,278 --> 00:54:57,960
Speaker 0: Yeah So, uh, I'm looking for hopefully only Astro boy living on his own instead of with a cool family.

899
00:54:58,081 --> 00:55:01,840
Speaker 1: Hopefully season two actually does come out and you forgot to do the same thing.

900
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,068
Speaker 0: You know that Astro boys dad did and you know doctor whatever.

901
00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:06,873
Speaker 0: Yeah and make a robot family.

902
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:13,713
Speaker 1: I Doubt B's dad cast her out because she wasn't exactly dad.

903
00:55:13,753 --> 00:55:15,859
Speaker 0: No, the dad probably died or went away or something.

904
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:17,725
Speaker 1: Yeah So we'll see.

905
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:24,395
