1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,458
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, December 19th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:10,659
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:14,128
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,956
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:19,849
Speaker 1: Holy shit, we do a Wednesday episode about, well, you'll find out.

6
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:25,490
Speaker 0: You could have just said, you know, winter anime chart 2012, 2013.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,053
Speaker 0: You know what?

8
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:29,210
Speaker 1: We're judging anime solely by their covers.

9
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:31,228
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,550
Speaker 1: So last night, me and Scott and Emily went to see The Hobbit, and it was awesome.

11
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:45,370
Speaker 1: And all I have to say is, all the people who said that 48 FPS is super unnerving and weird in Benny Hill, nah.

12
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:47,549
Speaker 1: Nah, it's pretty much the best thing ever.

13
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:49,050
Speaker 0: Oh, I mean, you know.

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:55,488
Speaker 1: There were moments where a few shots looked odd, but I'm pretty sure those few shots, it was not the 48 FPS.

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,570
Speaker 1: It was the Ultra HD and the really stark 3D combined that made the effects look weird in the background.

16
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,349
Speaker 0: It's hard to tell.

17
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:16,209
Speaker 1: I also found two separate studies that showed that children who haven't seen many movies in the theater don't notice anything weird about 48 FPS at all.

18
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,248
Speaker 0: Oh, that makes sense.

19
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,570
Speaker 1: And I have an anecdotal evidence from when I was a kid, right?

20
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:29,130
Speaker 1: I had one of the first multimedia CD-driven games on my PC when I bought my multimedia PC with a 2x CD-ROM.

21
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,069
Speaker 0: I had 4x CD-ROM.

22
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:30,644
Speaker 1: I know you did.

23
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:32,239
Speaker 1: Well, 'cause I had a 486 SX.

24
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:34,050
Speaker 1: 'cause I didn't know better back then.

25
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:41,890
Speaker 0: I had a DX 400, 100 megahertz, a whole extra digit, an order of magnitude more megahertz than anyone else had.

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,045
Speaker 1: My 486 SX2, fuck the SX, that was a big mistake.

27
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:54,551
Speaker 0: I also started with 8 megs of RAM and upgraded to 16, so I actually- I started with 4 and spent several hundred dollars to get up to 8.

28
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:56,850
Speaker 0: I said 16, I didn't need to use boot disks anymore.

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,610
Speaker 1: So I had a game called Tex Murphy Under a Killing Moon.

30
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:01,269
Speaker 0: I know that game.

31
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:03,370
Speaker 1: And I had another game.

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,088
Speaker 0: Had a demo of that.

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,710
Speaker 1: Phantasmagoria.

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,730
Speaker 0: Did not have that, but I know it.

35
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,530
Speaker 1: That game came on seven CDs.

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:17,290
Speaker 1: So, and that game had a thing where if you had multiple CD-ROM drives, you could put all the disks in at the same time.

37
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,570
Speaker 1: And it had this whole screen to configure that and everything.

38
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,890
Speaker 1: But anyway, so the games had cutscenes.

39
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:35,950
Speaker 1: And it had a mode, if your computer sucked, which was pretty much every computer, where it would basically display video where every other scan line was just a black bar.

40
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:43,898
Speaker 1: So it was black bar video, black bar video to have the resolution it had to display so it could actually display it at a reasonable- It was like 320 by 200 anyway.

41
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:53,649
Speaker 1: But, and I remember when I finally got a computer fast enough to turn that off, the video looked really weird to me.

42
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:57,910
Speaker 1: And that was just because I was used to the previous shittier format.

43
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,750
Speaker 1: But the moral, 48 FPS is the future and anyone who can't deal with it really is just going to have to.

44
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,029
Speaker 0: Well, I only, I don't know.

45
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,010
Speaker 0: The only thing I would disagree with you on is that, you know, saying it's the future implying that, you know, everyone should use it for everything.

46
00:03:13,831 --> 00:03:23,650
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, everything new in the cinema, I feel like should be projected digitally with 48 FPS if it can be filmed in that manner.

47
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:30,930
Speaker 1: Now, I know there'll be a long period where not every, it's not worth it to spend the extra money to be able to film in that capacity or render in that capacity.

48
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:38,570
Speaker 1: But I'm pretty much not going to theaters ever that don't use digital projection and project in the format the movie was shot in.

49
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:39,588
Speaker 0: Well, of course, yeah.

50
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:41,058
Speaker 0: But that's just obvious.

51
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,690
Speaker 0: Of course, you always see a movie the way it was shot.

52
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,250
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is that, you know, it's an artistic decision, right?

53
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:45,496
Speaker 0: Is it?

54
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,481
Speaker 0: Because it does look different.

55
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,550
Speaker 0: It is not identical.

56
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:56,052
Speaker 1: However, I would argue that- You may want your movie to look a different way, just as you might use- I'd argue that's the same.

57
00:03:56,073 --> 00:03:56,655
Speaker 1: That's the same.

58
00:03:56,675 --> 00:04:00,470
Speaker 1: There's a good example and a bad example, which is why I'm not 100% disagreeing with you.

59
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:09,090
Speaker 1: The good example would be when Alfred Hitchcock decided to film Psycho or Pacifico in black and white, even though color was available because he thought it suited the movie better.

60
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,470
Speaker 1: The other example is when people add bullshit film grain to their digital movie after the fact.

61
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:16,089
Speaker 0: A good example, yes.

62
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,375
Speaker 1: So, yes, those are good for effects.

63
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:23,310
Speaker 1: But for an average movie, I don't think using archaic technology is a good idea.

64
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:24,252
Speaker 0: Oh, no, yeah.

65
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:31,950
Speaker 0: But the other thing is, even if you want your movie to look different, the projectors in the movie theaters should run at the highest frame rate.

66
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,802
Speaker 0: And if you want your frame rate to be decreased, just double up all the frames.

67
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:43,710
Speaker 1: If you want it to be 24 FPS, just double up- No, to get that film effect, you'd have to project basically, like you'd have to black it out between them.

68
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:45,128
Speaker 0: I don't know.

69
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,130
Speaker 0: Couldn't you just shed the same frame twice, then the same frame twice?

70
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,432
Speaker 1: I guess it depends.

71
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:56,950
Speaker 1: Remember, though, with film, the part of that was that there was the delay between each frame getting in front of the lens.

72
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:02,916
Speaker 1: Anyway, the 48 FPS is not what made the movie look weird to some people.

73
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:11,770
Speaker 1: It was the fact that it was so HD and so 3D that some of the CG effects were, it was obvious they needed another render pass.

74
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:19,843
Speaker 1: Well, no, I think the biggest thing for me that- Look at the costumes, what occasionally you'd see, like, "Yeah, that is obviously a costume.

75
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,949
Speaker 1: Look how blocky that piece of supposed metal

76
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:22,110
Speaker 1: is.".

77
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:33,870
Speaker 0: The only visual thing, since that seems to be the controversial aspect that bothered me in the movie, was that some of the shots that were sort of distant from the small people far away, which there are a lot of, right?

78
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,764
Speaker 0: Like, "Oh, look at those small guys all the way in that distance, over yonder on the mountain, running across the mountain.

79
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:41,769
Speaker 0: Oh, look at those people over there running across a wooden

80
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:42,070
Speaker 0: bridge.".

81
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,555
Speaker 0: They're like tiny little guys all the way over there.

82
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:53,710
Speaker 0: A lot of those shots looked tilt-shifted because of the combination of the 3D and the- Ah, I think that was primarily the 3D.

83
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,741
Speaker 0: But it wasn't like 100% tilt-shifted.

84
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,330
Speaker 0: It was like slightly tilt-shifted.

85
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:09,290
Speaker 1: Because what I noticed was that the 3D was very well done, but most of the scenes, well, not most, but a lot of the scenes, everything, no matter what layer it was at, was in stark focus.

86
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,169
Speaker 0: That is, I noticed that as well.

87
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:13,470
Speaker 0: Which was actually pretty awesome looking.

88
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,459
Speaker 0: It was very rare that anything on screen was not in almost complete focus.

89
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:24,550
Speaker 0: I think once there was a scene of someone's face and the forest in the background was a little blurry.

90
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:37,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess I will say that in general, my whole life, I've hated film grain, I hated those artifacts just appearing in my movies, and the flicker of film in cinema always bothered me.

91
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:41,590
Speaker 1: I noticed, and it really bothered me, the flickering you'd see.

92
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:50,530
Speaker 0: It bothers me when it's during the movie, but it's like, you know, if it's that little thing at the beginning of the movie where you put the name of your company, it's okay to be like, you know, tick-a-tick-a-tick.

93
00:06:52,611 --> 00:07:01,510
Speaker 1: But I didn't like that, and I really enjoy the fact that this movie was so smooth, and that's why I really want other movies to be just smooth like that.

94
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,050
Speaker 1: It looked like just a perfect digital panel with none of the artifacts I used to expect from film.

95
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:09,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, why would you want to watch Damaged Goods?

96
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:10,330
Speaker 1: I know.

97
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,090
Speaker 0: There actually was, did you notice, there was like a hole in the screen or something in the bottom right area?

98
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,249
Speaker 1: Yes, oh my god, I was staring at that for like the first five minutes of the movie until I forgot about it.

99
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,510
Speaker 1: I forgot about it when the dwarves showed up, because by the time they showed up, my god, those dwarves.

100
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:26,449
Speaker 1: So, this was the segue.

101
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:27,590
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

102
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,570
Speaker 1: Because I went to the film festival.

103
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,047
Speaker 0: He's on a roll, he can't shut up.

104
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:32,309
Speaker 1: It's a geek bite.

105
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,029
Speaker 1: Because it's anime day.

106
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:38,210
Speaker 1: I went with Emily and randomly with our friend Chase and some other people.

107
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,369
Speaker 1: You know, it's weird.

108
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:48,330
Speaker 1: It's a city of so many millions of people, and yet I'll run into like friends randomly just walking around in the streets with such a frequency.

109
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,310
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, if they're your friends, you likely have things in common.

110
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,490
Speaker 0: It seems you're likely to go to the same places at the same time.

111
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:00,910
Speaker 1: Well, kind of like how whenever you and me go to see an anime movie in the city, no matter what theater it's in, no matter what day, when, it's like the same 20 assholes.

112
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:03,430
Speaker 0: That's the anime fans of New York City.

113
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:03,829
Speaker 0: I know.

114
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:04,850
Speaker 0: They show up at the anime things.

115
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,582
Speaker 1: There's only like 20 of us.

116
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,449
Speaker 1: I know all of you by face and like one or two of you by name.

117
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:11,489
Speaker 0: But I went to see Mononoke Hime.

118
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,705
Speaker 0: But we've seen that like 12 years ago.

119
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't seen it in 12 years, and it was in the theater, and I really liked that movie and hadn't seen it in a long time.

120
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,070
Speaker 1: So, went and saw it in the theater.

121
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:29,970
Speaker 1: And one, the print was mad old, so the whole movie, I just watched the film grain like dancing around, and it distracted me the entire time.

122
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,330
Speaker 0: It was probably a real film from the year 2000 and not, say, a video on a hard drive.

123
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,308
Speaker 1: And it was subtitled, so it had those kind of cool pre-digital subtitles.

124
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:42,010
Speaker 0: Oh, those yellow subtitles that were on the film itself.

125
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they looked really cool, actually.

126
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:56,170
Speaker 1: Kind of like how Ghost in the Shell, like the subtitles in the Ghost in the Shell movies looked so good compared to the subtitles on the DVD, because they were a different font and everything.

127
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,790
Speaker 1: But Mononoke Hime, if you haven't ever watched it, and I know you might think, "Why would you even question that I haven't watched

128
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:02,890
Speaker 1: it?".

129
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,930
Speaker 1: Remember, most people haven't seen most anime.

130
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,414
Speaker 0: What the?

131
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:06,528
Speaker 0: How could you not have seen it?

132
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,172
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll bet.

133
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:15,687
Speaker 1: In Anime Boston, Scott, right now, let's ask the audience of one of our panels how many of them have seen Princess Mononoke.

134
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,190
Speaker 1: I bet less than half.

135
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,241
Speaker 0: I know people who have never seen an anime in their lives.

136
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:23,568
Speaker 0: In fact, here's a story about Princess Mononoke.

137
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:24,350
Speaker 0: that's interesting, right?

138
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,704
Speaker 0: I had not yet seen Princess Mononoke at the moment it came out.

139
00:09:28,764 --> 00:09:30,490
Speaker 0: I think I saw it some months later, right?

140
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,230
Speaker 1: We showed it at RIT Anime in the theater.

141
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:36,690
Speaker 0: I saw it at that time, but I also saw it in VHS prior to that time.

142
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:36,963
Speaker 0: Ah.

143
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:40,399
Speaker 0: And I was in Israel, so I wasn't even at RIT yet.

144
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:41,322
Speaker 0: It was the summer of the year 2000.

145
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:42,166
Speaker 0: I was in Israel, right?

146
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,055
Speaker 0: And I was, you know, I knew animes.

147
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:47,438
Speaker 0: I had watched Robotech.

148
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:50,384
Speaker 0: I had watched Galaxy Express on Syfy Channel, right?

149
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,306
Speaker 0: I had watched Akira.

150
00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:53,170
Speaker 0: I was in the anime scene, right?

151
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:55,659
Speaker 0: But I wasn't as big as I was going to be.

152
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,867
Speaker 0: I didn't know Evangelion existed, right?

153
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:58,509
Speaker 0: Things like that.

154
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:03,950
Speaker 0: And I was in Israel, and one of the guys on the trip with me, his name was actually Ruben, and my name was Scott Ruben.

155
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:08,790
Speaker 0: And we were talking about anime in the back of our little, you know, group bus.

156
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,840
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Ah, I saw this thing, Princess Mononoke.

157
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,121
Speaker 0: It was

158
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:13,702
Speaker 0: amazing.".

159
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:14,886
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "I've never heard of that.

160
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:15,889
Speaker 0: I'll have to check that shit

161
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:16,130
Speaker 0: out.".

162
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:18,837
Speaker 0: And we were in a movie theater.

163
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:23,510
Speaker 0: We were in, basically, there was a shopping mall next to a beach, and the beach was full of jellyfish.

164
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:30,667
Speaker 0: So we were alternating between the sand and the mall because the water was jellyfish.

165
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:31,710
Speaker 0: He actually got stung.

166
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:36,710
Speaker 0: And in that mall, there was a movie theater that had the movie playing, and I saw the poster there.

167
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,487
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Whoa, that's probably got like Hebrew subtitles or some shit,".

168
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:39,668
Speaker 0: right?

169
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:49,670
Speaker 0: I did not see it then, but because I saw the poster, that was the thing that made me remember, and that's why I saw it on the VHS when I get back.

170
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,400
Speaker 1: So Scott, I will bet you $50.

171
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,890
Speaker 1: Pick any one of the panels we do at Anime Boston.

172
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:03,010
Speaker 0: But anyway, the original point I was making is that even some guy named Ruben, who was not a super anime fan in Israel, had seen this frickin' movie.

173
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:08,930
Speaker 0: For an anime fan, a self-described anime fan, to have not seen it, what the fuck?

174
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,300
Speaker 0: And he saw it before me when it came out in the year 2000.

175
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,708
Speaker 0: So you're an anime fan, you say you're an anime fan, you haven't?

176
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:17,510
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

177
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,870
Speaker 1: So the moral is, watching that movie again, that movie is amazing.

178
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,343
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

179
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:27,725
Speaker 1: So, watching it again, I just love that movie so much, and it's super good.

180
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:29,130
Speaker 1: You should all watch it.

181
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:33,109
Speaker 1: And I don't have anything else to say other than how awesome that movie is.

182
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,895
Speaker 0: Captain Obvious.

183
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:35,690
Speaker 0: I see him outside on the bridge.

184
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,150
Speaker 1: Geek Bite, not everyone listens to every Wednesday show.

185
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,777
Speaker 0: He's got binoculars, he's looking at you.

186
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,350
Speaker 0: He's checking to see if he needs to save you.

187
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,267
Speaker 1: It's also interesting- I'm waving him off.

188
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,930
Speaker 1: Because of all the Miyazaki movies, that one is like the peak of Miyazaki-ness.

189
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:53,490
Speaker 0: I think Spirited Away was the peak of Miyazaki-ness.

190
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,650
Speaker 1: Spirited Away, though, was a little less of the man, nature, environmental stuff.

191
00:11:58,872 --> 00:11:59,618
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

192
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:01,050
Speaker 0: The communist grandma in the woods?

193
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,547
Speaker 1: That was there, but that was a little less.

194
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:12,170
Speaker 1: Mononoke is the direct battle between the gods of the forest, the old world order, the humans, the- Okay.

195
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,870
Speaker 1: It's so direct, it's not even a metaphor, it's just literally, let's fight about it.

196
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,471
Speaker 0: Alright, sure.

197
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:21,149
Speaker 0: So, anyone who hasn't been living under a rock should know about War Z.

198
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:28,026
Speaker 1: So I only learned about it because someone a few days ago tweeted something about, "Hey, check out this bullshit

199
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:28,309
Speaker 1: game.".

200
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:29,207
Speaker 0: And I was like,

201
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:29,309
Speaker 0: "What?".

202
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:36,210
Speaker 0: So here's the information I've heard from people versus the information I've- Alright, because there was an update today.

203
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,550
Speaker 0: So you know that there is a game called DayZ, which is a mod for Arma 2.

204
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,620
Speaker 0: Yup.

205
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:45,050
Speaker 0: And I've learned a lot about that game from my coworker who's playing it a lot, he's sort of obsessed with it, right?

206
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:45,359
Speaker 0: Yeah.

207
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,209
Speaker 0: To the point of coding tools for it.

208
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:54,870
Speaker 0: So, apparently there was another game called War Z, and from what he told me, so this is just someone told me, right?

209
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,625
Speaker 0: Is that War Z came out as a game a long time ago, and it sort of, right?

210
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:00,990
Speaker 0: No one played that shit, right?

211
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,088
Speaker 0: So it sort of died.

212
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:12,790
Speaker 0: And then, when, you know, Arma 2, someone decided to make a mod for Arma 2 that was sort of what War Z was called DayZ, and that became actually popular.

213
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:20,010
Speaker 1: So this is interesting because someone relating the story on the blog that I read said basically the opposite order of events.

214
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,290
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

215
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:22,829
Speaker 1: I don't know, I've done no research on this.

216
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,529
Speaker 0: I don't know, this is the part I don't know.

217
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,769
Speaker 0: I'm just saying what I've heard.

218
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:36,250
Speaker 0: But that would be sort of like the equivalent of if Counter-Strike had tried to come out as its own game and died on the vine, and then Counter-Strike the Half-Life mod came out and succeeded, and took over the world.

219
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,466
Speaker 0: But anyway, so now, here's definitely the true parts, right?

220
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:41,390
Speaker 0: The parts we know for sure.

221
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,668
Speaker 0: There's a game called War Z that appeared on Steam, and it went straight up to the top, and people were buying it like crazy, and were like,

222
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:46,970
Speaker 0: "Whoa!".

223
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:50,169
Speaker 1: There's a moral here, remember what we just said, and I'll get back to it.

224
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,270
Speaker 0: There's a moral.

225
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:52,595
Speaker 0: How did that happen?

226
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:56,670
Speaker 0: It's obviously just some knockoff game.

227
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:03,710
Speaker 0: I mean, we knew that the DayZ people were working, and supposedly are working on a standalone version that they'll sell, presumably.

228
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,993
Speaker 0: But this is not it.

229
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:10,490
Speaker 0: This is War Z, some knockoff, and it just appeared on Steam, and tons of people were buying it.

230
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,950
Speaker 0: And it's like, why are people buying an obvious knockoff piece of shit?

231
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,552
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait.

232
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:19,306
Speaker 0: So, you're questioning the same class of people who put money down for the,

233
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:19,948
Speaker 0: "Ugh!"

234
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:26,550
Speaker 0: Oh, and the same people who don't read the internet, and don't realize what the fuck shit is.

235
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,977
Speaker 1: Yeah.

236
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:29,267
Speaker 1: The people are like, "Oh shit,

237
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:29,650
Speaker 1: zombies!".

238
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,710
Speaker 0: How many people paid money for this, and still don't know all the bullshit?

239
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:34,810
Speaker 1: Zombies.

240
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,452
Speaker 0: Yeah.

241
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:36,459
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

242
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:37,890
Speaker 0: This game went on Steam.

243
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,910
Speaker 1: Wait, why don't we make a Steam game that's steampunk zombies?

244
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:41,492
Speaker 0: Yeah.

245
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:44,038
Speaker 0: And unlike the Apple Store, right?

246
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:51,398
Speaker 0: You know, the Apple iOS App Store, where Apple verifies everything you put in there, Steam doesn't seem to do too much of that, right?

247
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,027
Speaker 0: They let games go on there that are crashy as fuck.

248
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:54,630
Speaker 0: They don't care.

249
00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:02,990
Speaker 0: They let games, you know, they just make a deal with you, and then your game goes up with very little, you know, supervising by Valve.

250
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,090
Speaker 1: But they will step in in many situations.

251
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,628
Speaker 0: They did step in on things, but they just let games go up there without testing them, or anything.

252
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:10,030
Speaker 0: They don't care.

253
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:12,069
Speaker 1: And I've downloaded some games that just don't run.

254
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's bullshit.

255
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,890
Speaker 1: I paid like a dollar for them, so I don't worry about it.

256
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,849
Speaker 0: No, but it's still bullshit that you paid any amount of money for something that doesn't work.

257
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,736
Speaker 0: And they're very stingy with refunds.

258
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:31,230
Speaker 0: So this game went up, and the biggest problem was not that it didn't work, it's that it was super beta, but they were selling it like it was done a released full game.

259
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,390
Speaker 1: So there was a great interview recently.

260
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,815
Speaker 0: Well, well, well, not done yet.

261
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:42,376
Speaker 0: But, in addition, if you looked at the description of the game on Steam, the description was patently false.

262
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:53,070
Speaker 0: Like, it was basically describing the game as it would exist in the future, but the language was such that you would, any normal person would believe...

263
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,650
Speaker 1: Hey guys, if you pay us 20 bucks Geek Nights, you'll get the feed of Geek Nights.

264
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,580
Speaker 0: It would be like, "Listen to Geek Nights.

265
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,147
Speaker 1: Ten years worth of

266
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:01,630
Speaker 1: podcasts.".

267
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:12,127
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, actually there's only seven years worth of podcasts, and three years there will be worth ten years, maybe, but it would be like if we said, "Ten years worth of podcasts right now, because we're going to be around for three more

268
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:12,449
Speaker 0: years.".

269
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,581
Speaker 0: You know, you can't do that.

270
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:15,810
Speaker 0: It's false advertising.

271
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:23,130
Speaker 0: So it was a big uproar among the people on the internet who are fucking connected, and don't belong in our off-the-grid geeks episode.

272
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:25,023
Speaker 0: And they said, "Hey, what the fuck is this

273
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:25,608
Speaker 0: bullshit?".

274
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:29,310
Speaker 0: Not only are you a rip-off, but you're just lying in your game description.

275
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,496
Speaker 0: That's false advertising.

276
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,260
Speaker 0: I downloaded this game, believing all that, and I want a refund, fuck you guys.

277
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:38,395
Speaker 0: Or some of you were smart enough not to buy it, we're still, fuck you guys.

278
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:41,750
Speaker 0: And then, the interview rim was talking about.

279
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,717
Speaker 0: They interviewed the guy who made this game.

280
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,930
Speaker 0: It seems like some shady Russian dude.

281
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,990
Speaker 1: That interview was just, it was kind of amazing.

282
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:57,170
Speaker 1: Like, you'd expect in a situation like that, the company to either say nothing, or give those very like, "Well, there might be some misunderstandings.

283
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,548
Speaker 1: We're going to issue an apology, press release,

284
00:16:59,569 --> 00:16:59,750
Speaker 1: whatever.".

285
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:01,767
Speaker 1: The guy's just kind of douchey.

286
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:04,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seemed like definitely a shady Russian guy.

287
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,866
Speaker 1: He's like, "Well, the game does technically support up to 100 people.

288
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,085
Speaker 1: We just only kept it at 50

289
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:09,589
Speaker 1: currently.".

290
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,707
Speaker 1: And he's like, then the interviewee's like, "Well, why did you say up to 100?

291
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:14,722
Speaker 1: then, if it actually does only go up to

292
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:16,314
Speaker 1: 50?".

293
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:18,810
Speaker 0: Well, it could go up to 100, we just said it at 50.

294
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,589
Speaker 1: And this is when the interview got great, because then the guy's like, If you got a private server, you could make it 100 if you wanted to.

295
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,750
Speaker 1: Well, then why did you just say it could go up to a million?

296
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,790
Speaker 0: Anyway, so obviously you shouldn't pay any money for this game or play it or give a shit about it.

297
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,250
Speaker 0: But it caused this uproar on Steam to the point at which Valve pulled it off of Steam.

298
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:42,828
Speaker 0: So it's not, you can still go to the page for it, you just can't buy it.

299
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:48,870
Speaker 0: And I guess they are giving someone refunds, which is a huge deal, because Steam almost never gives refunds, ever.

300
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,453
Speaker 0: Right?

301
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:50,089
Speaker 0: Almost never.

302
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:58,150
Speaker 0: So, hopefully, you know, this will lead to a better deal on Steam, where Valve actually fucking checks shit out before it lets games go up.

303
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:07,089
Speaker 0: But, it shows you this sort of, you know, dual, you know, catch-22 situation that these digital software stores have, right?

304
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:20,050
Speaker 0: If they do what the Android store does, or what Steam was doing, just let shit go up there, people complain, you let malware in the store, there was false advertising on this item, I downloaded this shit, it didn't work.

305
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:24,190
Speaker 0: I want a refund on this, this is bullshit, it's not what I thought it was going to be, right?

306
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,670
Speaker 0: But, if you filter everything, like Apple does, then you get all these other complaints.

307
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,050
Speaker 0: They won't let me sell my shit in their store.

308
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,750
Speaker 0: They're being all restrictive, not letting me do, I can have freedom.

309
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:41,350
Speaker 0: They're charging too much money, taking, you know, and it's like, what do you, it's really only, can you think of a third option?

310
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,170
Speaker 0: You either filter the things that go in the store, or you don't.

311
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,170
Speaker 0: I mean, what do you think?

312
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:45,847
Speaker 0: Yup, and you know what?

313
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,990
Speaker 1: Steam, Valve kind of takes the best take.

314
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,489
Speaker 1: They generally let it go, but they step in either or two.

315
00:18:51,890 --> 00:19:00,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, they should allow you to get a refund on anything that you haven't significantly played by just taking it out of your account and giving you your fucking money back, right?

316
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,749
Speaker 0: Obviously, and they know how many hours you've played everything, too.

317
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:13,930
Speaker 0: So, it's like, if I download something, start it, and it crashes and doesn't work, and I want a refund, it's trivial for them to tell that, no, I haven't actually played this game, and I just want my money back, right?

318
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:24,290
Speaker 0: And two, they should look at the games before they allow them to go in the store on sale, and if there's, like, you know, obviously, no game is perfect.

319
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,569
Speaker 0: Any software in the world is going to have bugs.

320
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:40,190
Speaker 0: It is not, you don't have to demand it to be 100% perfect like a Nintendo game is, where the millions of dollars in testing that most game studios, especially indie studios, can't afford, but you should make sure it's not fucking crashing for, like, half the players.

321
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:44,449
Speaker 0: Like, if you look at the threads for a lot of games, you know, they just fucking don't work.

322
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,909
Speaker 0: You know, Hotline Miami was broken, it's working now.

323
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,070
Speaker 0: You know, Magica, the fucking network didn't, I don't even know if it still works.

324
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,810
Speaker 0: You know, what was it, Multiwinnia, was that the one?

325
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,989
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Multiwinnia.

326
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,620
Speaker 1: Right?

327
00:19:57,641 --> 00:19:58,950
Speaker 0: That wasn't Steam's fault, though.

328
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:09,230
Speaker 0: But, you know, there have been multiple cases of games just don't fucking work, and Valve, you know, should not let those go up until it is verified that they work to a reasonable extent.

329
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,630
Speaker 1: So, Anime Boston, you know, we're going to be there doing our usual panel-y stuff.

330
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,247
Speaker 1: We're not going to-.

331
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,189
Speaker 0: That's a ways off.

332
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,010
Speaker 0: Why are you talking about this in not the-.

333
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:21,230
Speaker 0: It's not the metamoment, why are you talking about it?

334
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,930
Speaker 1: One, because panel submissions end at the end of January.

335
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,484
Speaker 0: Okay, that's metamoment still.

336
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,050
Speaker 0: Okay, keep going.

337
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,796
Speaker 1: How's that metamoment?

338
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:28,690
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about us being there in that context.

339
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,110
Speaker 1: But I was perusing the website looking for anime news, I just ended up at the Anime Boston site.

340
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,410
Speaker 0: Why would there be anime news on the Anime Boston site?

341
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:42,010
Speaker 0: I went to the Anime Boston site to see if they'd announced anything, because- Oh, I guess, yeah, maybe if there was a guest announcement that'd be okay.

342
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,789
Speaker 1: And there were some, but then I noticed something.

343
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:55,570
Speaker 1: And I think this says something about the kinds of people who go to anime conventions, and the perceptions about them, that I find kind of funny, and I'm just going to let it stand as is.

344
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:03,849
Speaker 1: This, Anime Boston has a very extensive tipping guide for how much you should tip people at a hotel.

345
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:09,750
Speaker 0: Anime fans don't tip people at a hotel, because even if they know they should, they don't have any fucking money.

346
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,550
Speaker 1: Restaurants, bars, the doorman, the bellman, room service, housekeeping, how much money to leave all of these people.

347
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,133
Speaker 1: So, I want to go through this list.

348
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:18,538
Speaker 1: Restaurants, yeah, I tip.

349
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,610
Speaker 1: Bars, I don't tip if I get just beer.

350
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,310
Speaker 1: Nor do I tip if my cocktails suck.

351
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,734
Speaker 0: I don't drink, right?

352
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:31,010
Speaker 0: But if I did, I know that you should only tip a bartender if they prepare you a drink.

353
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:40,930
Speaker 0: If they simply pour a beverage, like they grab the soda fountain thing and push the soda button, or the water button, or if they just take a beer and open it and put it on the counter, they don't get any money for that, right?

354
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,469
Speaker 1: Now, if they pour my beer with the proper head, yes, I'll give them a couple of dollars or two.

355
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:45,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

356
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,854
Speaker 1: Or if they make my cocktail.

357
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:52,550
Speaker 1: But, again, if the cocktail sucks, even if I'm ordering more of them, no more tips.

358
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you get it wrong, you don't get any fucking money.

359
00:21:55,791 --> 00:22:00,430
Speaker 0: But if you're sitting there mixing stuff together with ice and shaking it and pouring it, then you get money.

360
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:09,710
Speaker 1: But I have to say, in general, my experience at bars in or near anime con hotels has been that the service has been so shitty that I've generally just given up on tipping.

361
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,290
Speaker 0: Right, but if you were some anime, you had to know that the service was shitty.

362
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I usually find out.

363
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:18,830
Speaker 1: So they always get one tip out of me, the first drink I get.

364
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:20,819
Speaker 1: Room service?

365
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:21,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't tip room service.

366
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,210
Speaker 0: I do not tip room service either.

367
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:23,771
Speaker 1: Bellmen?

368
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,850
Speaker 1: I refuse their services, and if they do it anyway, I don't tip them.

369
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,693
Speaker 0: That is also true.

370
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:31,389
Speaker 0: But yeah, the room service is so expensive, right, that it doesn't get a tip.

371
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,219
Speaker 1: Housekeeping, I really don't tip.

372
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,570
Speaker 1: Concierge, I don't tip.

373
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:36,277
Speaker 1: Front desk, I don't tip.

374
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,349
Speaker 1: Though they say don't tip the front desk, so that's OK.

375
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,180
Speaker 1: Maintenance, it says don't tip.

376
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,604
Speaker 1: maintenance.

377
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:41,230
Speaker 0: I don't tip them.

378
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:41,534
Speaker 0: Of course not.

379
00:22:41,554 --> 00:22:42,749
Speaker 0: Why would you even need to put that there?

380
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:50,890
Speaker 1: If you request an item like a pillow, an iron, a fridge, a rollaway bed, a general guide is one to two dollars for small items, three to five dollars for large items.

381
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:53,962
Speaker 0: No, that person is supposed to bring you that shit.

382
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:55,870
Speaker 0: That's part of the money you paid for the hotel room.

383
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,993
Speaker 1: Now, I hate tipping.

384
00:22:57,013 --> 00:23:04,450
Speaker 1: It's a separate thing, but I just find it funny that this anime con has a guide for its attendees on, hey, you should really tip people.

385
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,937
Speaker 1: I wonder who decided to put this guide here.

386
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,500
Speaker 1: What drove that?

387
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,943
Speaker 1: Did the hotel be like, look?

388
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:13,830
Speaker 1: Did some bartender be like, look?

389
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:16,805
Speaker 1: Is it just some well-meaning person inside of Anime Boston?

390
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:17,690
Speaker 1: I'm really curious.

391
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, it might have been, you know, some hotel people were like, yeah, fuck these anime cons.

392
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:24,530
Speaker 0: We don't make any fucking money when they show up.

393
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:24,931
Speaker 0: Yeah.

394
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:30,390
Speaker 0: Hey, poor ass high school kids cramming themselves into rooms making trouble for us.

395
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,437
Speaker 1: I'm referencing a story from pre-geek nights.

396
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:35,589
Speaker 1: I don't know if we've ever talked about it on the show, but I'll quote it.

397
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,478
Speaker 1: And if people don't know this anecdote, I'll tell it on another show.

398
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:41,508
Speaker 1: They're not as bad as those young Republicans.

399
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:42,030
Speaker 1: Jesus.

400
00:23:50,861 --> 00:23:52,866
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

401
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:58,660
Speaker 1: So I did not watch The Dark Knight Rises because I didn't like The Batman Begins.

402
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:06,020
Speaker 1: And I basically just haven't liked any Batman movie that wasn't animated since Michael Keaton played Batman.

403
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:09,336
Speaker 1: Really, I just don't like these movies.

404
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:09,840
Speaker 0: Me either.

405
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:18,680
Speaker 1: But Dark Knight Rises, I'd heard a few good things about, and a lot of people had told me with a straight face that it was a really good Batman movie.

406
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,040
Speaker 0: The same people who said Dark Knight Returns is so great.

407
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,580
Speaker 1: No, these people said, yeah, Rim, I know you didn't like Dark Knight Returns, but Dark Knight Rises is way better.

408
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,520
Speaker 0: The Dark Knight, I guess, is not Dark Knight Returns.

409
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,385
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's The Dark Knight Rises is the new one.

410
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:34,820
Speaker 1: They said Dark Knight Rises fixes all those problems, is more of a Batman movie.

411
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:43,380
Speaker 1: And to all the people who tried to get me to watch that movie, I dare you to tell me that what I'm about to link to is not, in fact, the god-awful truth.

412
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,940
Speaker 1: This is an honest trailer about this movie.

413
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, someone who went through the trouble to make this honest trailer, I'm inclined to believe them.

414
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:53,459
Speaker 1: So this is my thing.

415
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:57,380
Speaker 0: Even though I don't know if they're lying or not because I haven't seen it, nor am I likely to see it soon.

416
00:24:57,661 --> 00:24:59,739
Speaker 1: I dare anyone to tell me that this is not the truth.

417
00:25:01,605 --> 00:25:02,279
Speaker 1: You got a thing of the day?

418
00:25:02,441 --> 00:25:02,652
Speaker 0: I do.

419
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,216
Speaker 1: Cap'n?

420
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:12,000
Speaker 0: So, you know, you and I, we know, right, that we've had this common experience of, yeah, the people you went to high school with, meh.

421
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:16,620
Speaker 1: A few people survived and made well for themselves, and they're in our forum.

422
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,000
Speaker 0: But it seems that any given high school is going to have a few awesome people and everyone else around.

423
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:25,880
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean, it's telling that I look on LinkedIn and basically no one from my high school is there.

424
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,680
Speaker 0: So this is a YouTube channel named Animation Domination High Def.

425
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:37,780
Speaker 0: I think it's related to Animation Domination as in the block of cartoons on Fox, which includes Family Guy Simpsons.

426
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,940
Speaker 0: But this is a Charlie Brown Christmas reunion.

427
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:49,820
Speaker 0: And it's basically, the concept here is Charlie Brown moved to the city when he grew up and became an awesome person like us.

428
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,297
Speaker 0: Basically the same person as us.

429
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,920
Speaker 0: And he goes back to, I guess, the Peanuts town to see how things are doing around Christmas time.

430
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:03,040
Speaker 0: And all the other kids, and he goes to check them out.

431
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,260
Speaker 0: And then, you know, it's like, wow, okay.

432
00:26:08,162 --> 00:26:10,300
Speaker 0: So I can really identify with this video.

433
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:16,720
Speaker 0: And if you are a successful person who moved to a city that is definitely New York because you see him riding the subway.

434
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,259
Speaker 0: Then you will also identify with this video and you should watch it.

435
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:25,340
Speaker 0: If you are the kind of person who is, you know, that person who failed in high school.

436
00:26:25,562 --> 00:26:27,099
Speaker 0: Or maybe you despise people like us.

437
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:28,020
Speaker 0: Why are you listening?

438
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:32,159
Speaker 0: And you will not like this video because it's making fun of you.

439
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,759
Speaker 1: Scott, there's a Thursday show.

440
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,860
Speaker 0: What?

441
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,059
Speaker 1: How to not be those guys.

442
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,900
Speaker 0: Moved to the city like Charlie Brown.

443
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,399
Speaker 0: The end.

444
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,000
Speaker 1: There's one little scene in this where Charlie Brown like goes to a typical New York pizza place.

445
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:51,220
Speaker 1: And the little moment where he folds up his little plate and sticks it in the garbage.

446
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,199
Speaker 1: Just really, really evoked New York City for me.

447
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:55,894
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

448
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,340
Speaker 1: Like that moment, because I had that moment today.

449
00:26:59,004 --> 00:26:59,939
Speaker 0: And three days ago.

450
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,340
Speaker 0: I almost had that moment today but I chose salad over pizza.

451
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,660
Speaker 1: In fact the guys in my one pizza place now know me and they're always just giving me the same thing.

452
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:07,198
Speaker 1: They don't even ask.

453
00:27:07,523 --> 00:27:09,340
Speaker 0: For me it's the breakfast guy knows me.

454
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,700
Speaker 0: I just walk in and there's a bacon, egg and cheese on everything.

455
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,780
Speaker 1: I'm looking for a new breakfast guy because my last breakfast guy got shut down for mouse poop.

456
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:20,979
Speaker 0: My guys, they do have mouse poop but they still have a B. I think they might get it turned around to an A pretty soon.

457
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:25,320
Speaker 0: I think they actually have mice's but not mouse poops.

458
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,700
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the book club book is The Great Gatsby.

459
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,199
Speaker 1: We've got a bunch of stuff on the internet.

460
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,600
Speaker 1: Magfest is coming up in short order.

461
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,559
Speaker 1: We will be there drinking and playing games.

462
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:38,440
Speaker 1: And because it's Wednesday we launched a new show called Geek Nights Presents.

463
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,280
Speaker 1: Where we're talking about Shoujo Kakumei Utena in a sort of analytical review.

464
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:49,580
Speaker 1: It'll be between 30 and 50 episodes but it's popular but not popular enough.

465
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,860
Speaker 1: So if you want us to do it faster or if you like it then you gotta spread the word.

466
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,820
Speaker 1: You gotta get it on your Reddit and your Tumblr and all those things.

467
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,618
Speaker 1: Because the more it gets around the faster we're going to upload episodes.

468
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,980
Speaker 1: And we have already recorded episodes.

469
00:28:04,323 --> 00:28:05,452
Speaker 1: But we are not uploading them.

470
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:06,380
Speaker 1: We are going slowly.

471
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,019
Speaker 1: Unless you guys spread the word.

472
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,833
Speaker 1: So if you like it, get other people to like it.

473
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:12,255
Speaker 1: Get that view.

474
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:12,638
Speaker 1: count up.

475
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:17,500
Speaker 1: Because we will not shamelessly self-promote ourselves but it's totally okay if you do it.

476
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,140
Speaker 0: It is often said you should not judge a book by the cover.

477
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,826
Speaker 0: And that is true.

478
00:28:20,947 --> 00:28:22,219
Speaker 0: Look at how many books we got.

479
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,560
Speaker 0: Where it's a really good book and the cover is shit.

480
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,620
Speaker 0: Prince of Nothing volumes with the faces.

481
00:28:28,227 --> 00:28:29,380
Speaker 1: And there are often books.

482
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,100
Speaker 1: Granted, the originals had much better covers.

483
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,380
Speaker 0: There's also a newer cover that's better as well.

484
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,360
Speaker 0: There are also often books with awesome covers.

485
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,146
Speaker 0: And they fucking suck.

486
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,940
Speaker 0: I've seen bibles with awesome covers.

487
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:43,674
Speaker 0: The really awesome styling.

488
00:28:43,714 --> 00:28:44,580
Speaker 0: Maybe they're illuminated.

489
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:45,814
Speaker 0: But they suck.

490
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,720
Speaker 0: So you can't judge something by the first appearance.

491
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,746
Speaker 0: It's called prejudice.

492
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:50,451
Speaker 0: Prejudice.

493
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:51,780
Speaker 0: Judging before you know.

494
00:28:52,161 --> 00:28:54,440
Speaker 0: And that is a bad thing that we do not like.

495
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:16,860
Speaker 0: However, while that rule still holds true when it comes to the world of anime and manga, it just so happens, statistically speaking, that when you do judge an anime by its cover, at least when I do, or you do, or Daryl Surratt does, or Emily does, that 99%... Oh, I hit myself with the microphone.

496
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,660
Speaker 0: 99% of the time, we just happen to be right.

497
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,540
Speaker 0: It's not some general rule that holds true.

498
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:30,880
Speaker 0: Obviously, the cover does not by any law of the universe hold any relation to the qualities or properties of the thing.

499
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:32,480
Speaker 0: It just so happens.

500
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:40,680
Speaker 0: It just so that we're no anime well enough, that 99% of the time, our prejudice happens to be correct.

501
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:48,100
Speaker 0: So we have here the famous Winter 2012/2013 anime chart, the newest anime chart.

502
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,827
Speaker 1: By Zana.

503
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:49,780
Speaker 0: Zana.

504
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,519
Speaker 0: We are going to go down this list.

505
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,900
Speaker 1: Let's go left to right, top to bottom.

506
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:05,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we are going to judge each and every one of these based on the partial JPEG and two paragraphs of text that go with each one.

507
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:13,359
Speaker 0: And we'll see how close to 99% correct we get with our completely not true prejudice judgments.

508
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:18,540
Speaker 1: So, Boku no Emoto wa Osaka-o-kan.

509
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,580
Speaker 0: The anime adapts something something... I'm not going to read all of these out loud.

510
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:27,240
Speaker 1: So it's a bunch of books, tongue-in-cheek guide to dealing with people from Osaka.

511
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,340
Speaker 1: So it's about Osaka.

512
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:31,320
Speaker 0: So is it going to be racist against people from Osaka?

513
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:32,618
Speaker 0: I have a feeling it is.

514
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:36,260
Speaker 0: She spent about a decade living apart from her sister.

515
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,099
Speaker 0: She's looking forward to reuniting with her sister as they live together again.

516
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:42,179
Speaker 1: On the scale, there's no weird boobs.

517
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,960
Speaker 0: There are no weird boobs here.

518
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,848
Speaker 0: The character's cute.

519
00:30:44,868 --> 00:30:46,280
Speaker 1: She's got these single fangs.

520
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,540
Speaker 0: Single fang is always cute.

521
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,000
Speaker 1: But she's not drawn in the doubly moe forms.

522
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,639
Speaker 1: I think this actually might be a funny show.

523
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:57,519
Speaker 0: I think this is going to be the cute, funny, crunchy roll kind of show.

524
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:01,160
Speaker 1: The kind of show that I watch like Nichijou.

525
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it might be a little bit... I think it'll be like a step under polar bear cafe, right?

526
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,777
Speaker 0: Because it doesn't have that crazy...

527
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:12,660
Speaker 1: My only worry with this show is that I don't know enough about stereotypes of Osaka.

528
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,280
Speaker 0: I know that they're basically hicks, right?

529
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't know the details.

530
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:17,600
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

531
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,658
Speaker 1: Like the other day, Emily and I were watching some anime and...

532
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,399
Speaker 0: She's laughing hysterically and you don't know why.

533
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,039
Speaker 1: They were both.

534
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,139
Speaker 1: There was this exchange of dialogue that after it happened, we're like, "I think that was a

535
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:27,420
Speaker 1: joke.".

536
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,839
Speaker 1: And she's like, "Yeah, but I don't even get

537
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:28,900
Speaker 1: it.".

538
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:29,269
Speaker 1: And we're like,

539
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:29,618
Speaker 1: "What?".

540
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:31,519
Speaker 1: We rewind and it still doesn't make sense.

541
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,108
Speaker 0: Okay, maybe the subtype.

542
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:34,380
Speaker 0: No, she doesn't need the subtype.

543
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:34,919
Speaker 1: I don't know.

544
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:36,340
Speaker 0: Whatever.

545
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,560
Speaker 0: But yeah, it could be one of those ones where it's too far out there.

546
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:47,640
Speaker 0: But then again, you get like a Gog Manga VRE, which we get even though it makes those kinds of really have to be Japanese jokes.

547
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,239
Speaker 1: So far, this is the best show I've seen on this list.

548
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:51,260
Speaker 0: Great.

549
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:54,080
Speaker 0: No matter what the first show it was, it would have been the best show you've seen.

550
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:54,876
Speaker 0: Okay, next.

551
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,260
Speaker 0: Saki Achiga-hen, episode of Side A.

552
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,880
Speaker 1: That already looks like it's going to be weird and perverted.

553
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,700
Speaker 0: Last episode of the series.

554
00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:09,819
Speaker 0: Oh, it says, "Majang Powerhouse Elementary Sachi Girls Chancers and Television Flingers National Middle School in

555
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,140
Speaker 0: Majang.".

556
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:14,080
Speaker 0: So this is cute schoolgirls playing Majang.

557
00:32:14,381 --> 00:32:18,660
Speaker 0: So on the one hand, this is going to be good because it's sort of like a Majang show.

558
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:26,620
Speaker 0: And I love those sports action shows, but it looks like one of those ones where they're combining moe with the sports to get the double hit.

559
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:37,820
Speaker 0: And in that sense, this is something to avoid because you can just watch an awesome Majang show instead of watching this slightly obviously trying to be perverted Majang show.

560
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:41,500
Speaker 0: Like what was that, you know, training with whatever her name is.

561
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,175
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

562
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:47,160
Speaker 0: It was like, yeah, exercise and look at crotch and boob shots at the same time.

563
00:32:47,441 --> 00:32:50,480
Speaker 0: This doesn't look for this JPEG to be that perverted.

564
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:54,520
Speaker 0: But clearly, why would you need cute schoolgirls playing Majang?

565
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,760
Speaker 1: It's a show I wouldn't even notice.

566
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:57,699
Speaker 0: So, Savannah game.

567
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,960
Speaker 0: I guess they're going to alternate here, right?

568
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,719
Speaker 1: A young man follows blah, blah, blah.

569
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:02,720
Speaker 1: Anonymous message.

570
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,260
Speaker 1: All right.

571
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,900
Speaker 1: So it's some kind of bloody, serious mystery show.

572
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,260
Speaker 0: Oh, this is one of those situational things like nine doors, nine persons, nine hours.

573
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:11,639
Speaker 1: Or the darker than black.

574
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,380
Speaker 0: Or battle royale.

575
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:13,045
Speaker 0: Yeah.

576
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:15,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's bizarre rules that span the space.

577
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:16,420
Speaker 0: So it's a supernatural.

578
00:33:16,982 --> 00:33:18,247
Speaker 1: Darker than black wasn't that?

579
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:19,432
Speaker 1: it was the other one of.

580
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:25,255
Speaker 1: let's introduce this particular kind of mystery that is that has a particular set of rules around it.

581
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,319
Speaker 1: that seems to occur primarily in anime and manga.

582
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:34,220
Speaker 0: So this is create a scenario with a set of rules constraining the characters so that they're forced into a horrible situation.

583
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:34,920
Speaker 0: They need to escape.

584
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,400
Speaker 1: They find themselves in bizarre battles that span the space time continuum.

585
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:46,360
Speaker 0: They're mixing in the supernatural battling with the situational death note kind of thing.

586
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,215
Speaker 0: Together.

587
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:48,907
Speaker 1: It's based on.

588
00:33:48,948 --> 00:33:50,260
Speaker 0: it's based on a novel.

589
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:58,579
Speaker 0: This, you know, could be good, but I have a feeling this is going to be a lot more like, oh, what's that one where the guy shows up naked in front of the White House?

590
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:00,579
Speaker 1: Oh, Eden of the East.

591
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,140
Speaker 0: It's going to be a lot like Eden of the East.

592
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,999
Speaker 1: Now, if it's Eden of the East, that means every episode is worse than the one that came before it.

593
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,620
Speaker 0: I think that might be the case because I have a feeling what they're doing here.

594
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:09,757
Speaker 0: Right.

595
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,139
Speaker 0: It's based on a novel, it says.

596
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,580
Speaker 0: So it could mirror the novel.

597
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:24,659
Speaker 0: But this could also be one of those ones where they try it out and they figure out if the situational side is more popular or the supernatural battling is more popular and end up leaning in one direction or the other.

598
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,080
Speaker 1: Battling everything from dragons to shinsengu.

599
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,659
Speaker 1: I worry this show just kind of goes down.

600
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,600
Speaker 0: Supernatural battle.

601
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:30,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

602
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:31,659
Speaker 1: But I don't know.

603
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,978
Speaker 1: I'm ambivalent on it, actually.

604
00:34:33,185 --> 00:34:33,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

605
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:34,259
Speaker 0: It's it's it.

606
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,219
Speaker 0: This could go either way.

607
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,139
Speaker 0: It could be Eden of the East.

608
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,440
Speaker 0: It could be fucking death note.

609
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:37,848
Speaker 0: I don't know.

610
00:34:38,422 --> 00:34:38,551
Speaker 0: OK.

611
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:38,800
Speaker 0: OK.

612
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:42,119
Speaker 0: Tantei Opera, Milky Homes, Alternative two.

613
00:34:42,641 --> 00:34:46,560
Speaker 0: So this is a sequel to Tantei Opera, Milky Homes, Alternative one.

614
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:46,978
Speaker 0: All right.

615
00:34:47,621 --> 00:34:51,040
Speaker 1: I don't think anything with the word milk in the title is ever going to be to watch.

616
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,120
Speaker 0: This is apparently school girls who are a Sherlock Holmes team.

617
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:55,937
Speaker 0: That's why it's milky.

618
00:34:56,702 --> 00:34:59,160
Speaker 1: The girls look like especially the girl in the middle.

619
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,660
Speaker 1: They look like characters straight out of what was that old?

620
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,439
Speaker 1: Himiko Dan.

621
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:03,159
Speaker 0: I don't know.

622
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:04,579
Speaker 0: I know the name.

623
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,097
Speaker 0: Himiko Dan.

624
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:05,880
Speaker 0: I can't.

625
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,320
Speaker 1: Himiko Dan had a pretty good opener.

626
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,279
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, what's this?

627
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:09,779
Speaker 1: That show is dumb as shit.

628
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:10,240
Speaker 0: Yeah.

629
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:17,258
Speaker 0: So this is Detective School Girls is might be it's an original show is might be for younger kids.

630
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,640
Speaker 0: I'm guessing based on the picture.

631
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:19,020
Speaker 0: Right.

632
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,580
Speaker 0: Doesn't seem like it's super perverted.

633
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,739
Speaker 0: Moe just, you know, the cute for younger kids, Moe.

634
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:27,727
Speaker 0: But yeah, I don't look.

635
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:34,280
Speaker 0: I don't get the feeling from this, that the mystery part, which would be the good part, is going to be as good as, say, Detective Conan situation.

636
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:34,791
Speaker 0: Right.

637
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:37,839
Speaker 0: It's going to be sort of a shallow kind of thing.

638
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,279
Speaker 1: Looking at this picture lined up with any other pictures I've seen of similar anime from previous years.

639
00:35:45,222 --> 00:35:45,679
Speaker 1: Interchangeable.

640
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,103
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

641
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:48,038
Speaker 1: Poochie Maaz.

642
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:48,758
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

643
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:50,240
Speaker 1: Petite Idol Master.

644
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,619
Speaker 0: So it's related to Idol Master.

645
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:53,880
Speaker 1: It has an interesting sort of aesthetic.

646
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,536
Speaker 0: Idol Master.

647
00:35:55,122 --> 00:35:57,360
Speaker 0: So Idol Master is sort of the Pokemon of idols.

648
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:57,988
Speaker 0: Yep.

649
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:07,880
Speaker 1: So based on this, though, it looks to be the super deformed, overly hyper daily life of the seven hundred and sixty five pro idols of the Idol Master.

650
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:09,760
Speaker 0: So this is mini Idol Master.

651
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,740
Speaker 0: This is Idol Master Island.

652
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:14,460
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's like the island.

653
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:25,180
Speaker 1: It's Idol Master character, things like, you know, there are poochy daughter, which are the like TV versions of them that are in the same world.

654
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:29,240
Speaker 0: OK, so this is basically TV Idol Master.

655
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,600
Speaker 0: You know what?

656
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:36,859
Speaker 0: I'm actually used to be a big fan of all those cute side show as the versions of Lotus Island is way better than Lotus War.

657
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

658
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:37,948
Speaker 0: Right.

659
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:39,379
Speaker 0: So at least TV series.

660
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:40,087
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

661
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,255
Speaker 0: Why?

662
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,960
Speaker 0: You know, if I whether Idol Master is good or not, this could be cute.

663
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:48,980
Speaker 0: But I think I have a feeling you need to know Idol Master to get the jokes in this.

664
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,757
Speaker 0: So even though he might be good, I think it might only like to Idol Master, like a mini Potto.

665
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:54,300
Speaker 0: Exactly.

666
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,220
Speaker 0: Mini Potto makes no sense if you don't know Pat LaValle.

667
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,459
Speaker 0: But if you do, it's the greatest thing.

668
00:36:57,561 --> 00:36:59,499
Speaker 0: So I think this is going to be just like that.

669
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:05,000
Speaker 0: You need it's a super to form Idol Master, but you need to be an Idol Master fan already to appreciate its possible goodness.

670
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,788
Speaker 1: OK, apparently this next one, I'm I.M.E.

671
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,900
Speaker 1: does not look like a sequel to I'm I.M.E.

672
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,718
Speaker 1: Strawberry Egg.

673
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,120
Speaker 0: So I'm I.M.E The story follows girls in a manga club who fight evil invaders.

674
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:15,194
Speaker 0: Blah, blah, blah.

675
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:15,775
Speaker 0: Yeah.

676
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:22,339
Speaker 0: This seems like it's going to be Moet with a little bit of the El Hazard situation because they're in a manga club.

677
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:22,673
Speaker 0: Yeah.

678
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,099
Speaker 1: But the character designs.

679
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:24,717
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

680
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,779
Speaker 0: Oh, a little bit of the Maho Sakai situation.

681
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:27,565
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

682
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:29,480
Speaker 1: Now, the one girl has that octopus, right?

683
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,224
Speaker 0: It's going to have.

684
00:37:30,304 --> 00:37:32,940
Speaker 1: the other girl appears to have fish tied to her.

685
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:33,264
Speaker 0: Right.

686
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,360
Speaker 0: They're in a manga club.

687
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:40,080
Speaker 0: There's going to be that weirdness aspect, but it looks like it's mostly that Moe supernatural battling aspect.

688
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:48,420
Speaker 0: And I don't know if the weird octopus in the pot aspect will be enough to bring it into Maho Sakai territory simply because it's modern.

689
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,540
Speaker 0: I distrust it and feel that it's going to go into the other territory is not as good.

690
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:55,219
Speaker 1: So the AKB 48 anime next stage.

691
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:59,599
Speaker 1: So I wanted to watch an episode or just want to read the description of it because it really sets it off.

692
00:37:59,705 --> 00:37:59,771
Speaker 1: OK.

693
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,257
Speaker 1: In the original series, an interplanetary war broke out at the start of the 21st century.

694
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,780
Speaker 1: Earth's ecosystem was damaged and humanity was forced to flee the planet.

695
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:12,640
Speaker 1: In this new society, things that disturb the heart, like music and art, are forbidden.

696
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,401
Speaker 1: Forty eight years later, the legendary idol group is resurrected as AKB 48.

697
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:24,300
Speaker 1: Labeled as terrorists, they must take up arms to defend their careers and their fans.

698
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:28,180
Speaker 1: This is basically Charles Barkley shut up and jam guide.

699
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:35,100
Speaker 0: So the thing is AKB 48, the actual idol group, I must say, I am not a fan.

700
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,689
Speaker 0: You know, there are other idol groups that I can understand.

701
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:41,150
Speaker 0: the appeal of AKB 48 is music in Wreck-It Ralph.

702
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,160
Speaker 0: I do not like their music that I have heard.

703
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,954
Speaker 0: There may be a song they've done that I do like.

704
00:38:45,974 --> 00:38:46,700
Speaker 0: that I have not heard yet.

705
00:38:46,921 --> 00:38:49,819
Speaker 0: And all their music videos I have seen are creepy.

706
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,260
Speaker 1: Listen to their the Sugar Rush song from Wreck-It Ralph.

707
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:53,917
Speaker 0: I will do so.

708
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,597
Speaker 1: But I like it.

709
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,610
Speaker 0: But I've actually heard that the anime, the first one, which I guess this is a sequel to, was.

710
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:01,899
Speaker 0: some people liked it.

711
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,360
Speaker 0: Even people who didn't like AKB 48, it got some Internet buzz.

712
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,858
Speaker 1: The character designs look OK.

713
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:10,558
Speaker 0: So I'm not sure this could be.

714
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:12,320
Speaker 1: The girl in the top right is making a really good smile.

715
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:13,838
Speaker 0: I agree with that.

716
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:17,020
Speaker 0: And I like the girl in the top left who isn't smiling.

717
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,277
Speaker 0: She's sort of like, hey, hey.

718
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:19,660
Speaker 1: But she's got a big forehead.

719
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,080
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know whether to trust that hype on the Internet.

720
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:30,360
Speaker 0: And based on my dislike of AKB 48 itself, I have a feeling this might be like, you know, one of those meh shows.

721
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:32,919
Speaker 0: And this is a sequel to a potentially meh show.

722
00:39:33,562 --> 00:39:34,086
Speaker 0: So it could.

723
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:35,720
Speaker 0: it could even be a custom see Destiny.

724
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:36,357
Speaker 0: You don't know.

725
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:37,200
Speaker 0: Right.

726
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:38,339
Speaker 0: Or Macross seven.

727
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:43,480
Speaker 0: So yeah, I'm just going to say meh and move along.

728
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,381
Speaker 0: All right.

729
00:39:44,401 --> 00:39:56,160
Speaker 0: So Orey no Kanojo to Osana Osana, Najimi, Goshura, but so you do Osana Najimi.

730
00:39:56,283 --> 00:39:56,840
Speaker 0: That's the word.

731
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,163
Speaker 0: OK.

732
00:39:57,183 --> 00:39:58,900
Speaker 0: A young boy called something.

733
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,880
Speaker 0: He goes to high school.

734
00:40:00,262 --> 00:40:03,500
Speaker 0: He wants to go and be a doctor at the university school of medicine.

735
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,820
Speaker 0: His parents divorce and his goal.

736
00:40:06,664 --> 00:40:08,760
Speaker 0: He shuns all romance and love.

737
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:15,597
Speaker 0: But the school of beauty with the server, with the silver hair is way just returns and I guess is way into him.

738
00:40:16,284 --> 00:40:17,899
Speaker 0: And he has to go to harem show.

739
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:19,319
Speaker 0: It's a harem show.

740
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:20,800
Speaker 0: It's a light novel.

741
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:21,697
Speaker 0: It's a harem show.

742
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,130
Speaker 0: OK.

743
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,379
Speaker 0: The end harem show.

744
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:23,713
Speaker 0: Next.

745
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,599
Speaker 1: Nami Kei to Daima.

746
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:27,440
Speaker 0: The fourth season of Menominee.

747
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:30,560
Speaker 1: I know nothing about me looking at these three characters.

748
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:36,018
Speaker 1: The bottom left character looks too much like a creepy character from one of those Moe incest shows.

749
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:39,660
Speaker 1: I'm assuming this show is also Moe incest, unless proven otherwise.

750
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:40,917
Speaker 0: Way to go.

751
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:41,653
Speaker 0: OK.

752
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,879
Speaker 0: Senran Kagura.

753
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,737
Speaker 0: Look at that JPEG.

754
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:44,858
Speaker 0: Those boobs.

755
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,300
Speaker 0: Something action game ninjas.

756
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,779
Speaker 0: They all have gigantic tits.

757
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:49,938
Speaker 0: Fuck this show.

758
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:50,331
Speaker 0: Next.

759
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:50,844
Speaker 1: Wow.

760
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:51,718
Speaker 0: Yeah.

761
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,919
Speaker 0: They're they're like melons.

762
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,980
Speaker 1: And the next girl looks like Monica Magica.

763
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,516
Speaker 1: Next.

764
00:40:59,123 --> 00:40:59,658
Speaker 0: That's true.

765
00:41:00,141 --> 00:41:00,658
Speaker 1: Bakamatsu.

766
00:41:01,022 --> 00:41:01,254
Speaker 1: Ginge.

767
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,200
Speaker 1: Dan Roman.

768
00:41:03,483 --> 00:41:03,919
Speaker 1: Oh, Roman.

769
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,538
Speaker 1: And a Phantom thief in the Genroku era.

770
00:41:07,182 --> 00:41:07,552
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

771
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:08,190
Speaker 1: A shift.

772
00:41:08,922 --> 00:41:09,540
Speaker 1: The time frame.

773
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:09,920
Speaker 1: What?

774
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,459
Speaker 0: So it's another sequel to something called Bakamatsu, but I guess it takes in a different era.

775
00:41:15,902 --> 00:41:19,580
Speaker 0: So it's the same show, but in a different period of history.

776
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,230
Speaker 0: No.

777
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,380
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

778
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:21,734
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

779
00:41:22,223 --> 00:41:23,438
Speaker 1: It's based on a pachinko game.

780
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,383
Speaker 1: Whoa.

781
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:28,780
Speaker 0: That actually is kind of cool.

782
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:38,353
Speaker 1: Now, the worst case scenario for the show, I think, is it's a lot like darker than black and that it looks really cool and has a cool thing.

783
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:41,728
Speaker 0: bringing up darker than black, because that was like the archetype of the show.

784
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,740
Speaker 1: that by all appearances looks like it'll be awesome.

785
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:47,439
Speaker 1: But does this like sort of we talked about when we reviewed it.

786
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:51,020
Speaker 1: It does this kind of samey craft that makes it completely uninteresting.

787
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:56,739
Speaker 0: I think this is going to be one of those ones where it's like watch one episode and never to watch everything again.

788
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:57,418
Speaker 0: OK.

789
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:06,300
Speaker 0: Courtesy of Zettai Karen Children, the unlimited Hyobu Kiyosuke spin off of Zettai Karen Children, which I've heard of, but never don't know anything about.

790
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,479
Speaker 1: One guy's at level seven.

791
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Speaker 0: The plot summary from the original series is a world where ESP is common.

792
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,940
Speaker 0: It's a battling show, Shonen battling show based on a manga.

793
00:42:15,723 --> 00:42:17,520
Speaker 0: It's going to have fights that are way too long.

794
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,459
Speaker 0: Everyone is ESP-ers like Final Fantasy six.

795
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,160
Speaker 1: Aside from this is a sequel.

796
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:25,100
Speaker 0: So it's clearly just more battling.

797
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:31,595
Speaker 1: If you thought Esper was a cool word from some sort of mythology, no, it literally came from someone who does ESP.

798
00:42:33,488 --> 00:42:33,676
Speaker 0: ESP-er.

799
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,110
Speaker 0: Yeah.

800
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:37,080
Speaker 0: It's a freaking supernatural battling show.

801
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:37,416
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

802
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:37,773
Speaker 0: Yeah.

803
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,380
Speaker 1: Looks boring.

804
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,554
Speaker 1: Sent you.

805
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,440
Speaker 1: I don't know that character's sound looks cool.

806
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:42,819
Speaker 0: Looks like cute people.

807
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,020
Speaker 0: But not super cute with some fantasy action.

808
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,680
Speaker 0: This could be like a rave master.

809
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:48,180
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

810
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,300
Speaker 1: A demon king returns.

811
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,779
Speaker 1: You're right.

812
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,840
Speaker 1: If it's a if it's a rave master situation, I don't have any desire to watch it.

813
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,400
Speaker 0: It's a total rave master vibe here with my prejudice.

814
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,838
Speaker 0: So I'm writing it off and saying avoid because I don't even see a cute monster that rave master had.

815
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,169
Speaker 1: Oh, so the king's looking for the descendants of a great hero and seventy five people show up.

816
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:10,239
Speaker 0: That's actually not a bad set up.

817
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:10,840
Speaker 0: Yeah.

818
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:12,540
Speaker 0: We could use that for a burning wheel or something.

819
00:43:13,986 --> 00:43:16,260
Speaker 1: Oh, everyone thinks that the son of the great king.

820
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:16,592
Speaker 0: Yeah.

821
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:16,822
Speaker 0: OK.

822
00:43:17,484 --> 00:43:18,600
Speaker 0: Thanks for the idea show.

823
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,799
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll watch one episode of you as a reward.

824
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,440
Speaker 0: Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai next.

825
00:43:24,721 --> 00:43:28,760
Speaker 0: So it's another sequel, sequel to Boku wa Tomodachi based on a light novel.

826
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,720
Speaker 0: A half Japanese, half British transfer student is delinquent sullen girl.

827
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:34,977
Speaker 0: It's all tsundere.

828
00:43:35,641 --> 00:43:36,159
Speaker 0: Tsun Tsun.

829
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,360
Speaker 0: The two decide to form a club of misfits with hardly any friends.

830
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:45,179
Speaker 0: This could be at best.

831
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:49,880
Speaker 0: This seems it's like it's going to be a club for misfits with hardly any friends.

832
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:55,760
Speaker 0: This could be Haruhi, the not as good version is the feeling I get.

833
00:43:55,861 --> 00:43:56,838
Speaker 1: You still need to watch Haruhi.

834
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:57,660
Speaker 0: It's really good.

835
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,179
Speaker 0: At some point.

836
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,736
Speaker 0: Maybe that's OK.

837
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,320
Speaker 0: It's good.

838
00:43:59,565 --> 00:43:59,780
Speaker 1: All right.

839
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:00,505
Speaker 1: Huh?

840
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,859
Speaker 1: Sasami-san ganbaranai.

841
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,720
Speaker 0: Sasami-san at ganbaranai with an at symbol.

842
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,418
Speaker 1: Oh, it's Shaft.

843
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:07,169
Speaker 0: OK.

844
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,060
Speaker 1: And the character design looks pretty good.

845
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,540
Speaker 1: Is that a bad thing when it's Shaft?

846
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:14,440
Speaker 1: It's about Higi Kimori who spies on people.

847
00:44:15,582 --> 00:44:20,240
Speaker 1: Her brother takes care of her, even though she despises his slave like nature.

848
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,964
Speaker 0: So it's definitely.

849
00:44:23,466 --> 00:44:30,340
Speaker 0: I'm getting a welcome to the NHK vibe here, only it's a girl who's the Higi Kimori and there's a dude taking care of her.

850
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:36,200
Speaker 0: So the fantasy is that you're the dude taking care of the cute Higi Kimori girl who's also awesome at hacking.

851
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,880
Speaker 1: If it's a good show, it'll be because it's more like Rec than like I'm trying to think of a good example.

852
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,814
Speaker 0: It's not going to be like Rec.

853
00:44:43,343 --> 00:44:43,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, you never know.

854
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,540
Speaker 0: It's going to be that fantasy of you have a sister you're taking care of.

855
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:47,922
Speaker 0: She's.

856
00:44:47,942 --> 00:44:49,860
Speaker 1: no, I think it's going to focus more on her.

857
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,580
Speaker 1: And he's just a side character who's despised anyway.

858
00:44:52,882 --> 00:44:53,579
Speaker 1: That's my guess.

859
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,035
Speaker 0: Here we go.

860
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,479
Speaker 1: It seems to focus more on her spying on the outside world anyway.

861
00:44:59,382 --> 00:45:02,620
Speaker 1: But three beautiful sisters and brother relationship comedy.

862
00:45:03,108 --> 00:45:03,317
Speaker 0: Yeah.

863
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,080
Speaker 0: Mandai Jitachi ga isekai kara Kuruso desu yo.

864
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:09,625
Speaker 1: I like how you're getting.

865
00:45:09,645 --> 00:45:13,757
Speaker 0: the long Japanese name story follows someone who's bored with the world.

866
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:16,239
Speaker 0: Oh, an envelope shows up.

867
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:23,754
Speaker 0: Remember that he's transported to an alternate world with two other problem children who also got envelopes.

868
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,659
Speaker 0: They're girls.

869
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:32,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott, remember that creepy show about Alice in Wonderland that was like rape fantasy with the keys?

870
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, the girl does have bunny ears.

871
00:45:34,622 --> 00:45:35,500
Speaker 0: She's got cleavage.

872
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:42,359
Speaker 1: Also, I'm getting the same vibe from this picture that I got from that creepy, almost rape show that we reviewed many years ago.

873
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,699
Speaker 0: But I also get a slight vibe of the show with the horrible murders.

874
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:48,658
Speaker 0: But it was the.

875
00:45:48,962 --> 00:45:49,879
Speaker 0: Oh, when they cry.

876
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:50,204
Speaker 0: Yeah.

877
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,739
Speaker 0: It's getting a little bit of that going on there.

878
00:45:53,024 --> 00:45:53,838
Speaker 1: I don't think it's that.

879
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:54,253
Speaker 0: OK.

880
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:55,460
Speaker 1: I don't know.

881
00:45:56,263 --> 00:45:58,119
Speaker 1: The show worries me a little bit.

882
00:45:58,404 --> 00:45:58,655
Speaker 0: Yeah.

883
00:45:59,345 --> 00:45:59,798
Speaker 0: Anyway, next.

884
00:46:00,144 --> 00:46:00,538
Speaker 0: Bunny girl.

885
00:46:01,182 --> 00:46:01,879
Speaker 0: Bunny girl's not good.

886
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,108
Speaker 0: Go.

887
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:04,400
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

888
00:46:04,821 --> 00:46:08,180
Speaker 1: The face that line man is making on the left is the best face.

889
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,619
Speaker 1: I want to make that my Twitter icon.

890
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:12,840
Speaker 0: So far, this is the best show on the list.

891
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,537
Speaker 1: I'm making that my Twitter icon as soon as I upload the show to headline face.

892
00:46:17,698 --> 00:46:21,120
Speaker 0: line faces gives me the old school vibe.

893
00:46:21,221 --> 00:46:23,659
Speaker 0: And it's cool because you see, you know, this battling show.

894
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,219
Speaker 0: Wait, Scott.

895
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,960
Speaker 1: They it's not or they fight for their honor.

896
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely a kids battling show.

897
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:35,219
Speaker 0: But the fact that it's animal people battling, there's only a few shows like that that are actually in this vein.

898
00:46:35,703 --> 00:46:37,980
Speaker 0: I can only think of maybe like two and one of those.

899
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,120
Speaker 0: It's people who turn into animals to battle.

900
00:46:41,524 --> 00:46:45,180
Speaker 1: So what about these subset of animal robots that are used to fight?

901
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,980
Speaker 0: That's Transformers Beast Wars.

902
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,960
Speaker 0: But yeah, I'm getting like this would be fun for lols for like one or two episodes.

903
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:52,172
Speaker 1: Yep.

904
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:52,878
Speaker 1: Like Lola.

905
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,180
Speaker 1: It's like take care of Century Beast, but it's not making fun of the genre.

906
00:46:57,302 --> 00:46:58,099
Speaker 1: It is the genre.

907
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:58,364
Speaker 1: Yeah.

908
00:46:58,906 --> 00:46:59,180
Speaker 0: Right.

909
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:00,258
Speaker 0: OK, next.

910
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,458
Speaker 1: Italia anime.

911
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:02,359
Speaker 1: Fifth season.

912
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:02,839
Speaker 1: You know what?

913
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:03,520
Speaker 0: It's Italia.

914
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,560
Speaker 1: The comic was really funny.

915
00:47:06,966 --> 00:47:07,920
Speaker 1: I really liked it.

916
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,140
Speaker 1: Emily translated a shit ton of it back in the day.

917
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,980
Speaker 1: Anime, pretty dumb and poorly done, in my opinion.

918
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:14,840
Speaker 0: That's really popular.

919
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:15,459
Speaker 1: I know.

920
00:47:15,982 --> 00:47:17,260
Speaker 1: But not for the reasons it should be.

921
00:47:17,321 --> 00:47:18,559
Speaker 0: If you're an Italia fan, watch it.

922
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,079
Speaker 0: Otherwise, don't.

923
00:47:20,582 --> 00:47:20,623
Speaker 0: G.J.

924
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:21,350
Speaker 0: Boo.

925
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,180
Speaker 0: Short stories about the lives of high school students.

926
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:24,916
Speaker 0: This is going to be you.

927
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,140
Speaker 0: This is a short anime.

928
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:26,959
Speaker 0: I always like those.

929
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:27,147
Speaker 0: Yeah.

930
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,379
Speaker 0: But it looks like the high school students are all little chibi girls, so there could be some moe problems.

931
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:38,839
Speaker 1: But they could be so chibi that it's actually like chibi show from the 90s style and not creepy moe show like Minchotan.

932
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,880
Speaker 0: This could be sort of like somewhere in between.

933
00:47:44,602 --> 00:47:45,287
Speaker 0: What's the the?

934
00:47:45,569 --> 00:47:46,840
Speaker 0: the animals that are no good?

935
00:47:47,306 --> 00:47:48,020
Speaker 1: Oh, Dama Kedobu.

936
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,799
Speaker 0: It could be in between Dama Kedobu and Ozumanga Daioh.

937
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,580
Speaker 0: Cute high school girls in a Dama Kedobu kind of way.

938
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,080
Speaker 1: You need to watch Nichijou because I know about it.

939
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,798
Speaker 1: Have you seen it?

940
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,620
Speaker 0: I've seen an episode.

941
00:48:00,722 --> 00:48:01,699
Speaker 1: OK, you should watch more of it.

942
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,112
Speaker 0: Anyway, you've got the next one, DC, the third, the capo, the third white.

943
00:48:07,345 --> 00:48:07,640
Speaker 1: All right.

944
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,700
Speaker 1: This show is shit.

945
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,959
Speaker 1: I'm not even going to read the description because look at that girl's boobs.

946
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,999
Speaker 0: I saw the boobs coming half a page away.

947
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:15,939
Speaker 0: Is that all you're going to say?

948
00:48:16,222 --> 00:48:17,480
Speaker 1: I'm reading the description.

949
00:48:17,745 --> 00:48:17,958
Speaker 1: Oh, my.

950
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:18,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's even worse.

951
00:48:19,102 --> 00:48:19,559
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

952
00:48:19,643 --> 00:48:19,900
Speaker 1: Really?

953
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:21,540
Speaker 0: And this is what a third the third.

954
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,340
Speaker 0: So this is related to the Capo series.

955
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,200
Speaker 0: So the Capo series as a whole must just be some perverted mess.

956
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,286
Speaker 1: Those boobs just.

957
00:48:28,326 --> 00:48:30,500
Speaker 1: there's no way a show with boobs like that is good.

958
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:32,079
Speaker 1: Unless that show is called Slayers.

959
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:37,640
Speaker 0: OK, so Chihaya Furu second season.

960
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,519
Speaker 0: Chihaya Ayase is a frank and I mean, Gurung is fascinated by what was that?

961
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,400
Speaker 0: Oh, this is a. this seems actually is madhouse.

962
00:48:47,744 --> 00:48:48,920
Speaker 0: This doesn't look too bad.

963
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,036
Speaker 0: This looks, you know, similar.

964
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,644
Speaker 0: We had the high school girls playing.

965
00:48:51,665 --> 00:48:55,680
Speaker 1: character design reminds me of child's toy.

966
00:48:56,213 --> 00:48:56,380
Speaker 0: Yeah.

967
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:02,680
Speaker 0: So the other one, which looks like perverted girls playing mahjong, like some fantasy for a Yakuza in high school girls, right?

968
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,120
Speaker 1: This one actually looks like Emily's given the show the thumbs up, right?

969
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:13,720
Speaker 0: This looks to me like a Yawara fashionable Judo girl, except that it's Yawara fashionable card playing girl.

970
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,280
Speaker 1: Emily is like nodding and thumbs upping everything we're saying.

971
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:26,227
Speaker 0: So I mean, you could tell just by the the character design of the girl that it's not going to be the perverted kind, that it's actually about the card playing the same way that Hikaru no Go is about go.

972
00:49:26,247 --> 00:49:28,758
Speaker 0: only this girl is the main character, right?

973
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,419
Speaker 1: So all right.

974
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,660
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, actually, I'm going to put that on the list.

975
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,220
Speaker 0: That may be the best one so far, possibly in Toho, and it's a second season.

976
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:43,820
Speaker 0: So we can actually go watch the Chihaya Furu first season if we want.

977
00:49:44,121 --> 00:49:46,160
Speaker 1: So Häken Den, Tohu, Häken Abun.

978
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:49,980
Speaker 0: This immediately looks to me like looks dumb.

979
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's clearly a fighting show based on the character designs alone.

980
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:55,619
Speaker 1: I'm assuming this is dumb.

981
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,720
Speaker 0: This is a supernatural fighting show.

982
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,300
Speaker 0: It reminds me of Yu Yu Hakusho because the uniform the guy's wearing only it's not blue.

983
00:50:02,304 --> 00:50:03,599
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much all I got there.

984
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:09,957
Speaker 1: Confucianism, Bushido and Buddhist philosophy, dogs, whatever character designs alone make it look dumb.

985
00:50:11,101 --> 00:50:12,760
Speaker 0: Cuticle Detective Inaba.

986
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,840
Speaker 0: The story revolves around a private detective.

987
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:16,300
Speaker 1: OK.

988
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:17,699
Speaker 1: This looks to me.

989
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,520
Speaker 0: You haven't read Bakuman, have you, Rim?

990
00:50:19,702 --> 00:50:20,540
Speaker 1: I actually have not yet.

991
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:27,900
Speaker 0: In Bakuman, there's a manga they make, which is called PCP Perfect Crime Party.

992
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:33,540
Speaker 0: And this guy looks like sort of he's got the pose of the main character from Perfect Crime.

993
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:38,716
Speaker 1: That guy is a private detective who is part wolf human, created artificially, runs a detective agency.

994
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:45,500
Speaker 0: This looks like a cross for a supernatura... Yeah, this is a supernatural version of Perfect Crime Party.

995
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:53,200
Speaker 1: The mastermind of the Don Valentino gang is a literal goat who steals money to eat it.

996
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is just kind of ridiculous.

997
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:59,459
Speaker 1: This could also be ridiculous in the way that Dura was.

998
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:01,918
Speaker 0: Well, this looks to me more like Excel Saga.

999
00:51:03,123 --> 00:51:07,020
Speaker 0: This is Excel Saga plus Detective Conan in one.

1000
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,540
Speaker 1: I'll bet it's more Excel Saga crossed with Dura.

1001
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:16,040
Speaker 1: Anyway, just based on the cast of characters or maybe, maybe, but I'm stretching.

1002
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,740
Speaker 1: It's those two things with a dash, just a little dash of Pet Shop of Horrors.

1003
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,438
Speaker 1: But I doubt that.

1004
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:21,880
Speaker 0: Anyway.

1005
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:22,393
Speaker 0: Next.

1006
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,618
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

1007
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:33,039
Speaker 1: This looks like the kind of garbage you see on like those like C-level animated shorts that you see on Netflix, like all at once.

1008
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,180
Speaker 1: GD GD Fairies, second edition.

1009
00:51:36,622 --> 00:51:39,439
Speaker 0: It says second season, but it says episode zero only.

1010
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:46,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't watch this unless someone said this is one of those short throwaway in between commercials.

1011
00:51:46,721 --> 00:51:48,200
Speaker 0: This next show, I got the next one.

1012
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,779
Speaker 0: We're alternating.

1013
00:51:49,763 --> 00:51:51,499
Speaker 1: I would watch this based solely on that picture.

1014
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,240
Speaker 0: Ishida to Asakura.

1015
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:55,960
Speaker 0: The story centers around the friendship of high school boys.

1016
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,880
Speaker 0: The co-lead Asakura wants to become a teacher at a girls school in the future.

1017
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,340
Speaker 0: So there's a little bit of perversion there.

1018
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:10,020
Speaker 0: But while he wants while Ishida wants to become a florist with Asakura in the future, this looks to me like it's definitely in the Cromartie character.

1019
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,080
Speaker 0: I was going to say, because you got the guy is picking his nose with a fucking pencil.

1020
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,580
Speaker 1: But he's making that thoughtful face.

1021
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,560
Speaker 0: He's like, hmm.

1022
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,959
Speaker 0: This is like friggin.

1023
00:52:20,347 --> 00:52:20,980
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

1024
00:52:22,263 --> 00:52:22,727
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

1025
00:52:22,747 --> 00:52:24,160
Speaker 1: We're not watching a lot of anime yet.

1026
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,919
Speaker 1: We want to watch like five of these shows.

1027
00:52:26,362 --> 00:52:26,564
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1028
00:52:26,906 --> 00:52:28,660
Speaker 0: You think these shows can be fansubbed or available?

1029
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:30,013
Speaker 1: They might be.

1030
00:52:30,034 --> 00:52:30,499
Speaker 0: Hey, good luck.

1031
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:31,557
Speaker 1: I'll watch this show.

1032
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,061
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1033
00:52:32,101 --> 00:52:33,832
Speaker 0: This show is definitely a gag show.

1034
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:37,839
Speaker 0: Gog, manga, Biore, plus space brothers.

1035
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,145
Speaker 0: Cromartie.

1036
00:52:41,246 --> 00:52:43,140
Speaker 1: Anyway, Tamako markets.

1037
00:52:43,621 --> 00:52:46,480
Speaker 1: OK, story based, not based on pre-existing material.

1038
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,038
Speaker 1: The camera blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1039
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:50,539
Speaker 1: Doesn't tell me shit about it.

1040
00:52:51,022 --> 00:52:53,056
Speaker 0: It's made by people who made K-On!

1041
00:52:53,096 --> 00:52:53,640
Speaker 0: and Bakuman.

1042
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:56,380
Speaker 0: And I guess it's about a girl who works in a market.

1043
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,070
Speaker 0: So it could.

1044
00:52:57,152 --> 00:52:57,398
Speaker 0: All right.

1045
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:06,059
Speaker 1: So based on that information alone and this picture, I'll bet this show is one of those cute, pretty good shows that I'll watch on Crunchyroll whenever I'm bored looking for an anime to watch.

1046
00:53:06,622 --> 00:53:08,820
Speaker 0: Maybe it depends on how much it focuses on the market.

1047
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,040
Speaker 1: For example, this show is totally like this girl running a market.

1048
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:13,873
Speaker 1: I think I'll like it the same way.

1049
00:53:13,893 --> 00:53:15,951
Speaker 1: I like Polar Bear Cafe, but for different reasons.

1050
00:53:16,436 --> 00:53:16,679
Speaker 0: Could me.

1051
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:18,819
Speaker 1: Oh, I kind of know about this next show.

1052
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,460
Speaker 0: You can introduce it because I don't know anything.

1053
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,612
Speaker 0: My oh you.

1054
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:24,760
Speaker 0: Mao, you Mao, you should.

1055
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,520
Speaker 0: I watched the trailer by war between humans and demons.

1056
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,620
Speaker 0: The humans greatest hero.

1057
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:32,079
Speaker 0: This looks to me like a supernatural battling show.

1058
00:53:32,562 --> 00:53:43,819
Speaker 0: But because the people are tall, I have a feeling it might be leaning towards the last exile sort of battling, as opposed to now Naruto kind of battle.

1059
00:53:44,362 --> 00:53:45,840
Speaker 1: All it has big boobs.

1060
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:48,759
Speaker 1: If you're looking at this with us right now, look at those big boobs.

1061
00:53:49,344 --> 00:53:50,640
Speaker 0: And they're not as big as the other one.

1062
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:51,143
Speaker 0: No, no.

1063
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:52,240
Speaker 0: And the shape, the shape.

1064
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,300
Speaker 1: And look at the boobs on DC three to Capo three.

1065
00:53:55,924 --> 00:53:56,977
Speaker 0: It's the shape is different.

1066
00:53:57,017 --> 00:53:57,199
Speaker 0: Yes.

1067
00:53:57,641 --> 00:54:03,640
Speaker 1: These boobs are big, but they're at least shaped almost like an actually large breast would be shaped.

1068
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:07,400
Speaker 1: Maybe, which means that it's not a deal breaker, that there are large boobs.

1069
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:10,238
Speaker 1: When normally that is a deal breaker in anime pictures.

1070
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:10,480
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1071
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,192
Speaker 1: But I watched the trailer for this.

1072
00:54:12,212 --> 00:54:12,859
Speaker 1: You know what the deal is?

1073
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:14,800
Speaker 1: Great hero, demon lord.

1074
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,080
Speaker 1: Demon Lord is actually a really beautiful woman, but she's a demon lord.

1075
00:54:19,663 --> 00:54:20,477
Speaker 1: He's supposed to kill her.

1076
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:22,354
Speaker 1: And she's like, why don't we team up?

1077
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,499
Speaker 1: And he's like, I don't think I should team up with you.

1078
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:28,218
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1079
00:54:28,864 --> 00:54:31,160
Speaker 1: I think that if anything, we can agree on one thing.

1080
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,599
Speaker 1: This is a show that our friend Katsu will love the shit out of no matter what it's about.

1081
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,939
Speaker 0: Based on the description you just gave me, it's given me a scrap princess feel.

1082
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:43,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe maybe like take less exile, back it up a little bit, push it more in the Princess direction.

1083
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:49,226
Speaker 1: But it's definitely got an element of Spice and Wolf.

1084
00:54:49,448 --> 00:54:50,960
Speaker 0: I was about to say Spice and Wolf.

1085
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:56,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, which could be good or bad because Spice and Wolf had a lot of potential, but it focused on everything I didn't care about.

1086
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:58,640
Speaker 0: OK, Ganbare Lulu Lolo.

1087
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:01,560
Speaker 0: This looks like a kid show based on a picture book.

1088
00:55:01,823 --> 00:55:03,340
Speaker 0: It is for a cop of territory.

1089
00:55:04,544 --> 00:55:06,440
Speaker 0: I can watch an episode or two and go, yay.

1090
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:06,928
Speaker 0: And that's it.

1091
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,437
Speaker 1: Kotaro Torasan.

1092
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:15,140
Speaker 1: It just looks Konani.

1093
00:55:16,622 --> 00:55:23,780
Speaker 0: This looks like a cute dumbed down version of someone joins the ESP club.

1094
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,260
Speaker 0: What the hell is that thing?

1095
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,898
Speaker 1: You're not thinking of Mahout Skytie, are you?

1096
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:27,708
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

1097
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,600
Speaker 1: Because that shows like B plus, A minus.

1098
00:55:31,281 --> 00:55:32,920
Speaker 0: No, what the hell is the name of that thing?

1099
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,460
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're talking about.

1100
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,060
Speaker 0: It's that manga Dark Horse puts out.

1101
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,288
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

1102
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:39,120
Speaker 0: Which one?

1103
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,800
Speaker 0: Oh, why can't I think of the name of it right now?

1104
00:55:40,902 --> 00:55:41,800
Speaker 1: It's not on my goddess.

1105
00:55:42,985 --> 00:55:44,920
Speaker 0: No, it's oh, what the hell is it?

1106
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,999
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

1107
00:55:47,322 --> 00:55:48,999
Speaker 0: Why can't I remember this right now?

1108
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,699
Speaker 0: It's by the same guy who did MPD Psycho or no, was it?

1109
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,069
Speaker 0: What?

1110
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:54,800
Speaker 0: Oh, what the hell is it?

1111
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:56,040
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're talking about.

1112
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:01,659
Speaker 1: Based on the picture alone, it's a show that I just wouldn't even really pay attention to unless someone told me to watch it.

1113
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:09,171
Speaker 1: But I don't see anything outright objectionable, because while it seems to have some elements, it's also got that weird guy in the bottom right.

1114
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:12,339
Speaker 1: that leads me to believe it's not the kind of show you might otherwise think it is.

1115
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,573
Speaker 1: But I got nothing to go on.

1116
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:28,077
Speaker 1: Amnesia, however, let's see, oh, it's based on a game, so it's guaranteed to be bad, but it gives me the slightest hint of a Monte Cristo vibe just because it's got some interesting styling going on.

1117
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, the styling on those playing cards.

1118
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,320
Speaker 1: But I've seen many shows that similar styling.

1119
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:36,499
Speaker 1: I'm going to guess this is a shitty fighting show based solely on what I just looked at.

1120
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:36,900
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1121
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:40,640
Speaker 0: She meets her apparent boyfriend despite not knowing his face, right?

1122
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:48,340
Speaker 0: That again gives you that Eden of the East idea, but because it's boyfriend, I'm beginning to think it's more in the perverted direction.

1123
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,780
Speaker 1: But based on a game, I'm going to say it's not actually perverted.

1124
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,759
Speaker 1: It's just a shitty fighting show.

1125
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:52,392
Speaker 0: Could be.

1126
00:56:53,165 --> 00:56:53,360
Speaker 0: All right.

1127
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,940
Speaker 0: Yama no Susume.

1128
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,179
Speaker 0: The story is about two childhood friends.

1129
00:56:58,604 --> 00:56:59,900
Speaker 0: One has acrophobia.

1130
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,580
Speaker 0: The other one loves mountains.

1131
00:57:01,862 --> 00:57:04,940
Speaker 0: So it's a buddy opposite show that looks somewhat cute.

1132
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,078
Speaker 1: You know, it looks like they're.

1133
00:57:06,742 --> 00:57:08,900
Speaker 0: I get a neander seven vibe looking at the characters.

1134
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,840
Speaker 1: One kid's got a map and looks like they're ready to go climb mountains.

1135
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:17,298
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's like, you know, it could be like it was just Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash and no one else.

1136
00:57:17,582 --> 00:57:17,731
Speaker 1: OK.

1137
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:26,340
Speaker 1: OK, so for those of you who aren't looking at the pictures, I'm going to say the title of the next one, because based on the title, this might be a very different show, Man Girl.

1138
00:57:29,222 --> 00:57:31,600
Speaker 1: I think 4chan has a whole board dedicated to that show.

1139
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, it's not actually about anything to do with gender.

1140
00:57:34,441 --> 00:57:39,860
Speaker 0: It has to do with manga and the word girl combined as someone who doesn't know English came up with this title.

1141
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:42,200
Speaker 0: And it's two girls trying to make a manga.

1142
00:57:42,401 --> 00:57:46,059
Speaker 0: And it's basically the cute younger girl version of it could be cute.

1143
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:47,584
Speaker 0: And it probably has.

1144
00:57:48,066 --> 00:58:02,380
Speaker 1: it probably has less of the Bakuman learn about the industry stuff and more to cute girls, hair, face and character design of the upper right girl looks too much like all the scary incest shows I've seen where I'm dubious.

1145
00:58:02,442 --> 00:58:02,657
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1146
00:58:02,742 --> 00:58:02,810
Speaker 0: Why?

1147
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:06,845
Speaker 0: You're supposed to be a manga editor, but you have a teddy bear and you're wearing a cute night.

1148
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:08,160
Speaker 0: because they're not manga editors.

1149
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:09,295
Speaker 1: They want to be OK.

1150
00:58:10,444 --> 00:58:11,539
Speaker 0: We only got four left here.

1151
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:15,012
Speaker 0: Vivid Red Operation, the heroine of a girl.

1152
00:58:15,053 --> 00:58:17,040
Speaker 0: science fiction action anime.

1153
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:23,440
Speaker 0: So, you know, looking at it, it looks like it might have a serious science fiction kind of plot.

1154
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,099
Speaker 1: It's set in a peaceful world where science has solved all problems.

1155
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:26,840
Speaker 0: Right.

1156
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:31,300
Speaker 0: You know, but, you know, the way the girl is designed, basically, I learned something.

1157
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:31,978
Speaker 0: No pants.

1158
00:58:32,881 --> 00:58:33,358
Speaker 0: No pants.

1159
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,180
Speaker 0: Character design directed by Kazuhiro Takamura, Strike Witches, Strike Witches.

1160
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,239
Speaker 0: That tells you where this is going right next.

1161
00:58:40,822 --> 00:58:48,980
Speaker 0: I mean, it feels, though, based on this picture and description, like it's going to have a little bit more of serious sci fi than Strike Witches while also still being Strike Witches.

1162
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,199
Speaker 1: She's not wearing pants.

1163
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,558
Speaker 0: I'm saying she says no pants.

1164
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,940
Speaker 1: Love Live School Idol Project.

1165
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,620
Speaker 0: Do we even need to say anything else?

1166
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,960
Speaker 0: It looks like School Long Live School Idol Project.

1167
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,300
Speaker 1: OK, this next one doesn't have a picture, but it should.

1168
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:02,940
Speaker 1: Train Hero.

1169
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:09,500
Speaker 0: The story of Train Hero deals with a rescue team that handles disasters and the high speed trains crisscrossing the world undergoes transformation sequences.

1170
00:59:10,941 --> 00:59:12,860
Speaker 1: I know what I want this show to be.

1171
00:59:13,021 --> 00:59:15,960
Speaker 0: It's probably going to be, what's that already existing train show?

1172
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:17,418
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1173
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,360
Speaker 1: I know what I want this show to be, but it's not going to be that.

1174
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,160
Speaker 1: This is going to be fucking X-Driver.

1175
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,140
Speaker 1: It's going to be garbage.

1176
00:59:25,501 --> 00:59:32,420
Speaker 1: It's a show that you might, if you haven't watched X-Driver and been tricked by it, you might watch this thinking, oh, my God, trains.

1177
00:59:32,521 --> 00:59:33,120
Speaker 1: This is awesome.

1178
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,780
Speaker 1: And then five episodes in, you're like, wait a minute, this show actually sucks.

1179
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,020
Speaker 1: Same thing that happened.

1180
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,580
Speaker 1: You know, you can be tricked like noir tricked me with music, but it was shitty.

1181
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,040
Speaker 1: A hex sign tricked me with music, but it was shitty.

1182
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,580
Speaker 0: This is going to trick you with trains, but it's going to trick me with trains.

1183
00:59:49,121 --> 00:59:53,938
Speaker 1: Just like X-Driver tricked me with, oh, my God, his character designs, but nothing else going for it.

1184
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:59,360
Speaker 0: The final one, Doki Doki Precure, the tenth TV series for Precure.

1185
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,273
Speaker 0: It's Precure.

1186
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:02,655
Speaker 0: The end.

1187
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:12,820
Speaker 0: We're not going to do the OAVs in the movies, but I just want to say the best thing on this Even though the first one there is Saint Oni-san.

1188
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,000
Speaker 0: Which is the best thing on this entire page.

1189
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,660
Speaker 0: Oh, my God, I'm going to watch all of that no matter what as it comes out.

1190
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:26,359
Speaker 0: If you don't know, Saint Oni-san is basically the story of Jesus and Buddha share a low rent apartment in Tokyo.

1191
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:27,423
Speaker 0: That's the.

1192
01:00:27,503 --> 01:00:29,359
Speaker 0: you couldn't sum it up any better than that.

1193
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,580
Speaker 0: It's a long running manga.

1194
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,940
Speaker 1: So, Scott, that's awesome.

1195
01:00:32,302 --> 01:00:36,040
Speaker 1: That Senyu, the one from above that was kind of fantasy that we worried might be Rave Master.

1196
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:44,440
Speaker 1: Look at that other picture from it of the girl with the little horns and her straight jacket, long sleeves and the little skull guy.

1197
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:45,298
Speaker 0: I see this now.

1198
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,520
Speaker 1: The problem is I've never seen an anime that had characters as awesome as that.

1199
01:00:49,742 --> 01:00:50,337
Speaker 1: That was good.

1200
01:00:51,324 --> 01:00:52,659
Speaker 1: But that character looks awesome.

1201
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,280
Speaker 0: The guy's eating popcorn.

1202
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,297
Speaker 0: It looks like Gourry.

1203
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,719
Speaker 1: And the skull thing just reminds me a little bit of Zormal Gooster.

1204
01:01:00,525 --> 01:01:01,518
Speaker 0: I was about to say, yeah.

1205
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:08,600
Speaker 0: Also note OAV, Mobile Suit Gundam, 8th MS Team, Blu-ray Disc Memorial Box.

1206
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,640
Speaker 0: Can't go wrong there.

1207
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,800
Speaker 1: Oh, there's one piece film Z coming.

1208
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:13,862
Speaker 0: Z?

1209
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:15,428
Speaker 0: That's the 26th one?

1210
01:01:16,562 --> 01:01:17,018
Speaker 0: I guess.

1211
01:01:17,983 --> 01:01:18,479
Speaker 0: Is there anything?

1212
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,019
Speaker 0: I'm just not going to go over all these, just looking around quickly.

1213
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:26,660
Speaker 1: Oh, that Kaiketsu Zozori da da da Daibouken actually looks pretty great.

1214
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,400
Speaker 0: Okay.

1215
01:01:27,581 --> 01:01:27,996
Speaker 1: Look at that.

1216
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,320
Speaker 1: Look at that rabbit girl and that fox guy.

1217
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:29,617
Speaker 1: Where is it?

1218
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,020
Speaker 1: The fox guy?

1219
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:30,816
Speaker 1: Movies.

1220
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,120
Speaker 1: Third one from the left.

1221
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:32,680
Speaker 0: Oh, that one.

1222
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:32,957
Speaker 0: Look at that.

1223
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,312
Speaker 0: That looks like a kid's anime movie.

1224
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:35,100
Speaker 0: that's going to be pretty good.

1225
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,940
Speaker 1: Kid's anime movies tend to be awesome.

1226
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:37,246
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1227
01:01:37,702 --> 01:01:38,558
Speaker 1: Or really dumb.

1228
01:01:41,861 --> 01:01:42,540
Speaker 0: Berserk Ogon.

1229
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,479
Speaker 0: Is that related to Berserk Berserk?

1230
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,839
Speaker 0: Because it looks like something that might be, who knows?

1231
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:47,811
Speaker 0: Studio 4C.

1232
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:48,940
Speaker 0: Oh, you know that's a winner.

1233
01:01:49,562 --> 01:01:49,878
Speaker 0: Of course.

1234
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:50,340
Speaker 0: Okay.

1235
01:01:50,569 --> 01:01:50,697
Speaker 0: Good.

1236
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,600
Speaker 0: We got something from the sun going on here.

1237
01:01:53,845 --> 01:01:54,659
Speaker 0: And I think that's enough of that.

1238
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:07,000
Speaker 0: So, uh, that's what you may have to look forward to in the near future of anime based completely on guessing a handful of JPEGs and a handful of unreliable paragraphs.

1239
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,260
Speaker 1: If any of you tell us to watch one of these enough and we can, we'll review it.

1240
01:02:11,721 --> 01:02:14,897
Speaker 0: And also we should come back to this or someone else should come back to this.

1241
01:02:15,018 --> 01:02:22,508
Speaker 0: after all these shows are out, listen to this episode and then see how close our guessing came to the truth.

1242
01:02:29,481 --> 01:02:31,600
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1243
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,759
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1244
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:42,160

1245
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,080

1246
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:49,840
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
