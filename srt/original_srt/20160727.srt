6
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's like the tail end of a lot of the expenses that came up.

7
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:47,469
Speaker 0: It's like oh just bought me a plane ticket to PAX Yeah and bought some Tickets to PAX that I have to then turn back in and we didn't even pay for the hotel at PAX.

8
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,750
Speaker 1: yet We're gonna pay for that when we get there right looming expense.

9
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:53,686
Speaker 0: And then you know, it's like there's a lot of stuff that gets paid for.

10
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:58,506
Speaker 1: like right after PAX I'm going to Australia with Emily too and I like my church paid for but hers isn't.

11
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:02,770
Speaker 0: and then You know even people who aren't in like, you know a pack situation.

12
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:06,649
Speaker 0: It's like they got a. you know, some people got to spend money on back-to-school shit.

13
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:08,930
Speaker 0: You know, it's like some people, you know, so much.

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,710
Speaker 0: It's for some reason no matter which kind of if you live in a you know, this society.

15
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:20,990
Speaker 0: I guess this happens to be a time of year when the money gets spent and then you got to save the money again.

16
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,657
Speaker 0: See how you have holiday monies.

17
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:24,745
Speaker 1: I mean, I we don't worry about money like.

18
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,030
Speaker 1: we're pretty well off money wise.

19
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:28,369
Speaker 1: It's just kind of how it goes, you know tech guys in New York.

20
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:38,525
Speaker 1: But this is the time of year when I go from ignoring my finances to paying my credit card and saying wait Really that much and then click it on transactions like what the fuck did I buy?

21
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,189
Speaker 1: and then it's like oh, yeah I guess a bunch of plane tickets.

22
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:53,992
Speaker 0: So, of course, this is also the time of the year when some guy finally decides to call me like two years After I fill out a web form and say hey you want to give me like a whole bunch of money and I'm like god Damn you.

23
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:54,876
Speaker 0: Why are you calling now?

24
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,778
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, I know what guy you're talking about Right the guy from the ticket office.

25
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:02,890
Speaker 1: So they have not called me yet for whatever reason, right?

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:12,889
Speaker 0: So, you know by there are certain things in life that are usually the realm, you know Usually priced in the realm where only rich people can have them like a Ferrari.

27
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,157
Speaker 1: Yep Now a lot of these things are also things.

28
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,883
Speaker 1: there are things that are rich.

29
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:23,910
Speaker 1: people today are the only people who have them But in a distant past these are the kinds of things that a family would save up for in like half.

30
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could have a Ferrari a long time ago.

31
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,083
Speaker 0: Maybe if you were half rich.

32
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:38,599
Speaker 0: Yeah now you got to be whole rich Right, but one of those things that you used to be able to afford even if you were not rich With season tickets to sporting events.

33
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,410
Speaker 1: now, you can still afford them if you live somewhere terrible.

34
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:46,470
Speaker 0: Well, okay, if you maybe if you live somewhere terrible, but also how much are season tickets to the Sabres?

35
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:47,896
Speaker 0: I don't know.

36
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,510
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to look it up while you keep talking.

37
00:02:49,610 --> 00:03:01,230
Speaker 0: Like even if you want to buy Mets season tickets, right and you can sit in the nosebleed at the top of the stadium It's still a shit ton of games like 90 games multiplied by ticket price, right?

38
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:07,769
Speaker 0: It's thousands of dollars to buy those tickets and then even if you do and even if you're a super Mets fan You don't have time for that shit, right?

39
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,360
Speaker 0: But a long time ago years ago.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,501
Speaker 0: I filled out a form that said Yeah, I'll buy some season tickets to New York Rangers.

41
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:19,095
Speaker 0: Why the fuck not if you call me and I can't afford them I just won't buy them.

42
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:21,406
Speaker 1: I got on the list but I actually so way back.

43
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:22,250
Speaker 1: I did the same thing.

44
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,615
Speaker 1: But I put myself in the like.

45
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:28,634
Speaker 1: I want a full season of really good seats because I figure by the time I get to The top of that waiting list.

46
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:31,285
Speaker 1: I'm hoping that I'll be like 50 and rich.

47
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:32,249
Speaker 0: Good luck with that.

48
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:36,130
Speaker 1: So Scott, how much you think it costs to get a season ticket?

49
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,343
Speaker 1: Full-on season a hundred percent season to a decent seat at the Buffalo Sabres.

50
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:43,490
Speaker 0: I imagine it's like 50 games ish, right?

51
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:52,262
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right every game like rings probably 50 games Times like let's say let's say ringside.

52
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:55,554
Speaker 0: Oh, that's got to be at least like $200.

53
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:57,902
Speaker 1: so no, there's it's 70 bucks a game.

54
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:06,590
Speaker 1: It's three grand percent for center ice Most expensive the 200 Club like now, let's see.

55
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,059
Speaker 0: Well, let me like at ringside.

56
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,745
Speaker 0: so I'm thinking at the glass center.

57
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:15,420
Speaker 1: Yes at the glass Not center ice but like one right of center ice.

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,517
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yeah, that's the whole season it's only.

59
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:24,090
Speaker 1: it's only 100 bucks to go to one of those games just buying a ticket, right?

60
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:25,584
Speaker 0: So I bought Rangers tickets.

61
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:29,859
Speaker 0: finally Oh my god They were able say I couldn't afford a whole season.

62
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:34,742
Speaker 0: and even if I could have afforded a half season Which I assume would be three times.

63
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:35,970
Speaker 0: I couldn't have afforded a half season.

64
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:44,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if I that would have been like credit debt for a little while even if I could have afforded a Half season I couldn't have gone to all those games.

65
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:48,747
Speaker 1: Yep, right And while we could easily scalp them to make up the cost that is a pain in the ass.

66
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,430
Speaker 0: it's pain in the ass.

67
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:56,690
Speaker 0: So they have the like the small the mini plan, which is 11 games and you know, they rip you off.

68
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,570
Speaker 0: They make you buy the preseason game which cost the same as a regular game.

69
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,943
Speaker 1: So really a cheap seat costs at a Sabres preseason game a cheap seat.

70
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, 15 bucks up 14.

71
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:14,610
Speaker 1: All right Yeah, 15 gets you down a whole rung anyway so The you can't really choose.

72
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:16,558
Speaker 0: This is the first basically the way it works.

73
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:20,868
Speaker 0: the more years you do it the sooner you get to buy the tickets We need more seats are available.

74
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,266
Speaker 0: So since I'm in year one, I was actually shocked that any seats are available because they bit first.

75
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:39,625
Speaker 0: you make a deposit $500 deposit and if you don't get tickets, you can either leave your deposit in to basically hold your space in line Or take your money back without losing anything.

76
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:40,913
Speaker 1: a moral here Alrighties.

77
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:43,064
Speaker 1: you kids complain about comic-con or PAX tickets.

78
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:44,992
Speaker 1: It could be way worse Right.

79
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:45,574
Speaker 0: So I left.

80
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:48,302
Speaker 0: I put the final deposit in like months ago.

81
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:52,835
Speaker 0: So they were holding on to my $500 for months Right, then they.

82
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:58,789
Speaker 0: he calls me like a week ago and he's like, alright on Friday I'm gonna I'm gonna call you again and that's when you can actually buy tickets.

83
00:05:59,313 --> 00:05:59,978
Speaker 0: Here are the four.

84
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:01,569
Speaker 0: here are the plans you can choose from.

85
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:07,410
Speaker 0: So one of the mini I. there are four mini plans and one of them had better opponents and better times to go see the games.

86
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:13,021
Speaker 0: So I chose that one And he's like you probably only buy tickets like behind the net.

87
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:16,310
Speaker 0: I'm like, alright, whatever and next year maybe better tickets.

88
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:23,710
Speaker 0: So he calls me on Friday last week and the tickets were a hundred and eighty dollars each times eleven.

89
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:29,649
Speaker 0: So like four thousand dollars for two seats times two seats.

90
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:37,770
Speaker 0: So a bottom and I can probably make the money back no matter at least half the money back because I almost all of them.

91
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:44,917
Speaker 0: If you decide you don't want them, I mean, I'm either gonna go to a game which for $180 And actually the seats are in the corner.

92
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,583
Speaker 0: They're not like straight behind the net.

93
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:48,490
Speaker 0: They're actually really good seats.

94
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:51,740
Speaker 1: I prefer sitting in the corner.

95
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:54,269
Speaker 0: They're on the 100 level, but they're kind of high up on the 100 level.

96
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,775
Speaker 0: So it's not like you're so low.

97
00:06:55,795 --> 00:07:03,346
Speaker 1: You can't see what's going on the other side, but like I for real I'd rather say That's all high up nose bleeds than perfect center ice most of the time.

98
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:11,521
Speaker 0: Anyway, so and then I just paid the money, but the $500 deposit went towards it.

99
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,426
Speaker 0: So it actually cost me only 3500 additional dollars.

100
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:17,550
Speaker 1: All right, so I did any and I bought two tickets.

101
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,730
Speaker 0: So if I go to a game I still selling the other ticket to somebody.

102
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:29,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, either someone I know or someone I don't know I'm gonna charge him what it cost or I'm gonna charge, you know more than what it cost to make my money back.

103
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:35,600
Speaker 0: yeah, and if they make the playoffs which yeah, I Can sell one.

104
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:35,984
Speaker 0: you can.

105
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:41,362
Speaker 0: you know I'm in line To get playoff tickets more easily and I can sell those.

106
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:50,150
Speaker 0: that even if I buy five games of playoff tickets I'm buying four games at face value and selling one game at like way above face value and I can just pay for everything.

107
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:54,010
Speaker 0: It's like the whole thing will break even if I just sell one game of playoff tickets.

108
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,717
Speaker 0: Cuz one seat for the playoffs.

109
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:56,660
Speaker 0: like a thousand dollars.

110
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,210
Speaker 0: now you've got but I'm only paying like a hundred something for it.

111
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,650
Speaker 1: You've got extra incentive for them to make the playoffs than normal, right?

112
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,070
Speaker 0: And then next year I could just if I save my money I can do it again and get a better seat.

113
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:10,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, but yeah, we'll see how this goes.

114
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,607
Speaker 0: So my parents bought season tickets in the nosebleeds in the 70s.

115
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:19,689
Speaker 0: But if you look at those tickets, which they physically have it's like five bucks.

116
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:25,345
Speaker 0: Five bucks per game times every single game for the Buffalo Sabres.

117
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:30,690
Speaker 0: if you wanted to sit Run why do you want a chicken Buffalo Sabres on to check like, Arizona?

118
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,255
Speaker 1: Because I feel like Sabres might.

119
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:36,626
Speaker 1: it's just Sabres is a nice baseline for crappy tickets.

120
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:37,929
Speaker 0: Why'd you take Florida Panthers?

121
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:48,997
Speaker 1: $4,400 is season tickets ringside center ice every game And all the preseason.

122
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:51,110
Speaker 0: so we moved to Buffalo for the same amount of money.

123
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:55,788
Speaker 0: I could have seen every game and not just 11, but would you want to know?

124
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,348
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, no if I'm in Buffalo, yes, cuz there's nothing else to do.

125
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:03,458
Speaker 1: Drive to RIT and see for RIT games instead.

126
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:05,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean you got time for both.

127
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, what else are you doing?

128
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:10,557
Speaker 1: So you got any news cuz it's anime day.

129
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:12,162
Speaker 0: I got so much news right here.

130
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,607
Speaker 0: So first little news is yep.

131
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:25,329
Speaker 0: little news number one Naoki Urosawa's current manga Billy Bat which has been coming out slowly and sporadically but not in English at all Which I have not read any of not even like bootleg scans lation Whatever is coming out.

132
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:37,146
Speaker 0: It will end in three chapters Which means if you follow the pattern of history all of his mangas have come out except for the ones that were way old Have started coming out in English after they finished in Japanese, right?

133
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:38,150
Speaker 0: It's like 20th century boys.

134
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,253
Speaker 0: The last volume came out.

135
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:41,379
Speaker 0: then they announced it for English.

136
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,970
Speaker 0: So they the Billy Bat is gonna end in three chapters.

137
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:49,738
Speaker 0: So I assume that Viz will probably announce volume one like next year sometime.

138
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:51,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is gonna be great.

139

Speaker 0: Small news number two this week on the comic book delivery list is I think Queen emerald is volume one.

140

141
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:12,060
Speaker 0: It's actually a hardcover which is weird, but yet no Legi Matsumoto manga has not had great releases in the US.

142
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,860
Speaker 0: I think there were a few volumes of Galaxy Express released a long time ago, and I don't know if any Harlock mangas came out.

143
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:23,530
Speaker 0: I think there were some Adaptations that weren't actually the originals released.

144
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,300
Speaker 1: don't see him even in like bargain bins hanging around at anime.

145
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, there I don't think they were ever put out in English officially, but there's a ton of them and I'd like to read them.

146
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,533
Speaker 0: So hooray volume one.

147
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:38,273
Speaker 0: Yeah This was true in the past but it went away but now it's back.

148
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:45,577
Speaker 0: you can watch the three Original Mobile Suit Gundam compilation movies on YouTube for a limited time with subtitles for free.

149
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:49,380
Speaker 0: legally They keep putting them up and taking them away.

150
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,760
Speaker 0: There's like a YouTube channel Gundam info Like put stuff up and takes it down and put stuff up and takes it down even other people.

151
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,069
Speaker 1: What's funny is the same thing just happened to through Tana all of you.

152
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,237
Speaker 1: Tana is just on YouTube right now legit.

153
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:02,203
Speaker 0: Nice Subbed.

154
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:05,595
Speaker 0: I assume I didn't check because it was on Hulu dubbed for a long time.

155
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:06,036
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah.

156
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:13,000
Speaker 0: So yeah, I mean I just watched the TV show but people say you should watch the compilation movies.

157
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:17,711
Speaker 1: It's faster to do that Watch the original Gundam.

158
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:19,060
Speaker 1: So maybe I should just watch all these movies.

159
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:22,739
Speaker 0: It's the same story, but the compilation movies cut out some stuff.

160
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:27,738
Speaker 0: But really if you just read the Gundam the origin manga, you don't need any of these animes.

161
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:33,626
Speaker 1: Yep I read a little bit of that and I got to just queue up time to read the whole thing because it It's real good.

162
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:34,229
Speaker 1: Okay.

163
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,984
Speaker 0: Now the real news at Comic Con Announced Fox.

164
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:45,284
Speaker 0: All right, whatever has acquired the rights and is developing a film for Mouse guard.

165
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:50,157
Speaker 1: don't get too excited because as you know movies can be finished and not actually come out.

166
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:51,300
Speaker 0: that is true.

167
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:58,351
Speaker 0: But this doesn't seem like it's one of those cases where they are Like got the rights and did not making anything.

168
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:00,760
Speaker 0: It seems like they're actually making right?

169
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:09,534
Speaker 0: So the guy riding it is Gary Witte who wrote the Star Wars Rogue One movie that we haven't seen yet Yep, and they got some big animator resources.

170
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:22,597
Speaker 0: He's been like a mouseguard fan for a while And also they're using like this motion capture CG technology to do it Which is the same stuff they used for like one of the recent Planet of the Apes movies

171
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:26,473
Speaker 1: jungle book Which I heard mixed feelings on but at least is beautiful.

172
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:32,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's the technology They're gonna use to animate this which I guess is a lot easier than you know.

173
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:35,164
Speaker 0: hand drawing In the style of.

174
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:48,621
Speaker 0: could you imagine trying to animate it like by hand or even by computer and have it look like the David Peterson artwork it's like out in 2013?

175
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:50,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that it would take for fucking ever.

176
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:54,360
Speaker 0: so I guess that's a good choice and David Peterson doesn't seem upset.

177
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:57,611
Speaker 0: He's probably happy that is being made and also happy.

178
00:12:57,691 --> 00:12:58,293
Speaker 0: He's good money.

179
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:00,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I imagine he's happy about this.

180
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,528
Speaker 1: Mouseguard is pretty cool.

181
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:05,080
Speaker 0: He seems thumbs up on this like yeah, like oh, yeah.

182
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:09,740
Speaker 0: So if the guy who made the originals thumbs up, why wouldn't we be thumbs?

183
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,004
Speaker 1: He's also a pretty cool dude.

184
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:17,103
Speaker 0: if you watched any and thankfully because it's something that's all mice then You can't.

185
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:21,773
Speaker 0: we don't have to worry about a lot of issues like whitewashing or actor selection.

186
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:23,237
Speaker 1: What about man?

187
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:24,380
Speaker 1: if it's just mice?

188
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:26,788
Speaker 1: Why mice and men?

189
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,300
Speaker 1: why are we leaving the men out?

190
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,305
Speaker 1: Man erasure.

191
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:30,928
Speaker 0: Yeah.

192
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,316
Speaker 0: Yeah, which way did you go?

193
00:13:32,598 --> 00:13:36,020
Speaker 1: Yeah So Something happening.

194
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:42,780
Speaker 0: Well, I think this is now like the one of the only makes the shortlist of movies to be hyped for in the future.

195
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:43,849
Speaker 1: I am moderately high.

196
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:47,495
Speaker 1: Uh What if I was what was I hyped for before this?

197
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,545
Speaker 0: I guess Zootopia I'm also hyped for.

198
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:50,530
Speaker 0: I'm hyped for Rogue One.

199
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,820
Speaker 0: So Gary what is gone to out of the short list?

200
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,059
Speaker 1: I am super high for Rogue One because while Star Wars episode, you know, the newest one was not the best movie ever.

201
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:00,416
Speaker 1: Pretty good, like it reminded.

202
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:01,662
Speaker 0: I mean I'm just.

203
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:05,996
Speaker 0: I don't even care if Rogue One is garbage because I'm all about spaceships gonna pee pee.

204
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:07,040
Speaker 1: Pee also now.

205
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:17,563
Speaker 0: So you tell me we're making a new Star Wars movie and not only are we gonna have Starships going pee-pee-pew like every other Star Wars movie we focusing in on that shit and I'm like, well, I don't care This is garbage.

206
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got X-wing.

207
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:20,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got a tie fighter.

208
00:14:20,678 --> 00:14:20,939
Speaker 0: All right.

209
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,988
Speaker 0: Well, also our time money shut up and take my money.

210
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:28,240
Speaker 1: Vice Admiral Thrawn up is now canonical in the new Star Wars universe.

211
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:31,460
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't think he'd be at any live action in the theater.

212
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:37,259
Speaker 1: It would make a lot of sense for him to be in one of the regular trilogy movies that are coming out.

213
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:41,155
Speaker 1: I would hope they would because there is a way to have him.

214
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:45,658
Speaker 1: like, you know The Empire sent people out to the Outer Rim and he was leading them.

215
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,467
Speaker 1: He shows up and goes.

216
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,460
Speaker 1: what the fuck happened here because one in charge.

217
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,676
Speaker 0: Well, I read those throng novels that are so hyped by people.

218
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,527
Speaker 0: They're not good They're way overrated.

219
00:14:55,608 --> 00:15:05,700
Speaker 0: and if you tell me those are the best Star Wars novels I'm not reading any others garbage, but that doesn't mean the character of Admiral Thrawn is not the ultimate badass best Star Wars character.

220
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:06,771
Speaker 0: there is period.

221
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:18,460
Speaker 1: I Learned you he was when I played TIE fighter and Darth Vader's like sitting signal Vice Admiral Thrawn I have the tie squadron attack or whatever and then it cuts to this dude and he's sitting there holding stroking his chin.

222
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,899
Speaker 0: He clearly knows what he's doing.

223
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,386
Speaker 0: Yeah Like he looks like a badass.

224
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:26,640
Speaker 1: him and Darth and the moth the grandma for the only people who seem to know what they were.

225
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,329
Speaker 0: You know, the thing is Vice Admiral Thrawn.

226
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:35,910
Speaker 0: He looks a lot like one of my favorite x-men villains, mr Sinister, so I think I just like evil dudes with square heads.

227
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:40,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe bluish tint to the skin - mr Sinister is kind of white.

228
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:43,559
Speaker 1: Yeah depends on who and when who drew him and when.

229
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,164
Speaker 0: Yes Mr.

230
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:48,690
Speaker 0: Sinister who is not like a white?

231
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,071
Speaker 1: I've seen him white with like like, you know the shading on a face I've seen like blue shade.

232
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:54,280
Speaker 1: blue is shading on the face.

233
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,757
Speaker 0: He's got a red diamond thing stuck in his head.

234
00:15:56,777 --> 00:16:01,880
Speaker 0: Yeah And he's got a wicked cool cape that's like made of strips of like.

235
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,211
Speaker 0: It looks like his cape went through a shredder and he put it back on.

236
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:05,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, you didn't give a shit.

237
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:15,648
Speaker 1: So at the comic-con another thing that we saw briefly and we don't really have any thoughts on other than we'll probably the only time We have Wednesday news and there's a comic-con and we blow it all in one episode.

238
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:19,700
Speaker 1: Yep, but just guy Rishi's making a King Arthur movie.

239
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:26,194
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's making the shortlist for hype - cuz hey, I don't care if that's garbage either It's Guy Ritchie and a King Arthur movie.

240
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:31,640
Speaker 1: cuz you might be thinking wait Is he just gonna make a King Arthur movie but with the beats and tropes of a heist movie?

241
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,788
Speaker 1: And yes, there's apparently.

242
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:34,220
Speaker 1: yes, that is exactly what he's now.

243
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,340
Speaker 0: The only disappointment I have in the trailer is that he pulls the sword from the stone.

244
00:16:38,903 --> 00:16:45,125
Speaker 0: But if you know Lady of the Lake you wanted right under water Standing of King Arthur ness, right?

245
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:51,040
Speaker 0: Yeah young King Arthur pulls the sword from the stone and then somehow it gets lost or some shit.

246
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:52,453
Speaker 0: No, no, that's not what it was.

247
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:52,856
Speaker 0: I remember.

248
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:56,120
Speaker 0: now He pulls Excalibur from the stone when he's a young.

249
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:03,866
Speaker 0: The sword that the Lady of Lake gives him is not Excalibur or the sword in the stone isn't Excalibur and the Lady of Lake Sword is Excalibur.

250
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,193
Speaker 0: I think that's what it is.

251
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:07,242
Speaker 1: I Don't actually remember.

252
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:07,604
Speaker 1: I used to.

253
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:08,769
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

254
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:11,619
Speaker 0: The sword in the stone is not Excalibur, right?

255
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,460
Speaker 0: He pulls the sword from the stone and that's how they know he's gonna be king.

256
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,200
Speaker 0: But Excalibur is a magic sword that doesn't make you king or anything.

257
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,105
Speaker 0: It's just awesome.

258
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,296
Speaker 0: And that's what you get from the Lady of the Lake.

259
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:29,874
Speaker 0: So Sword in the stone is supposed to belong to young King Arthur so that they know he's gonna be king and that's why Merlin starts You know hyping him up when he's young.

260
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,719
Speaker 1: Excalibur and the sword in the stone.

261
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,783
Speaker 1: Arthurian romance.

262
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:37,090
Speaker 1: Arthur obtained the British throne by pulling a sword from a stone.

263
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,233
Speaker 1: Father Sigmund and account cannot be from trying to figure it out.

264
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:42,940
Speaker 0: The sword in the stone is not Excalibur.

265
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:53,120
Speaker 1: Yep and I want if you go to the Wikipedia on Excalibur the first big set segment is called titled Excalibur and the sword in the And it's not the same sword.

266
00:17:53,361 --> 00:18:00,340
Speaker 1: However in what was called the post Vulgate cycle Excalibur was given to Arthur by the Lady in the Lake sometime after he began his reign.

267
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:07,064
Speaker 1: she calls the sword Excalibur as to say that that is to say as cut steel in Vulgate Mortar to.

268
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:10,215
Speaker 1: Arthur orders Grifflet to throw the sword into an enchanted lake.

269
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:17,705
Speaker 1: after two failed attempts He finally complies with the wounded Kings request and a hand emerges from late to catch it Etc.

270
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:19,798
Speaker 1: I never really knew Arthurian legend that.

271
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:23,675
Speaker 0: well I'm saying is that Lady Lake is better than the stone.

272
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:24,680
Speaker 0: That's all I'm saying.

273
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:28,336
Speaker 1: So another great thing happened at comic-con it looks like but I'm saving that for my thing of the day.

274
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:29,973
Speaker 1: and something kind of shitty happened as well.

275
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:34,477
Speaker 0: This was my money by that in the Holy Grail say watery tarts.

276
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:46,775
Speaker 1: So there was a women in film production panel at SCCC, that's fine, that's a good panel.

277
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:48,420
Speaker 1: looks like it was a really good panel.

278
00:18:49,700 --> 00:19:01,492
Speaker 1: Apparently a SDCC staffer was in charge of the room to be like the moderator or whatever But the women on the panel were moderating it themselves and everything was fine.

279
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:10,038
Speaker 1: and apparently near the end of the panel This dude who is officially in charge basically just takes over the panel and

280
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,922
Speaker 0: Physically

281
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:18,444
Speaker 1: like he walked he walks up and like gets the starts talking to the crowd like so and starts telling his own stories Like out of nowhere,

282
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:20,473
Speaker 0: but why don't the people on the panel say who like?

283
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:21,860
Speaker 0: if we were doing a panel, right?

284
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,949
Speaker 0: And someone just came up on the stage and started talking.

285
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:26,200
Speaker 0: we'd say who the hell are you get off the stage?

286
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:26,861
Speaker 1: So it's got.

287
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:33,439
Speaker 1: most people who run panels or speak on panels are not really willing or prepared to do something like that.

288
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:36,720
Speaker 0: Then you how can you be on a stage if you can't even tell?

289
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:41,429
Speaker 1: One that is how the vast majority of people are to.

290
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,893
Speaker 1: the people who are usually on stages giving panels are There because someone else got them on.

291
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:50,548
Speaker 1: they're not really professional Performers or panelists like we are.

292
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:53,240
Speaker 1: they're just on a panel because they're an expert on the thing.

293
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,011
Speaker 0: Also, it's saying you're a comic-con.

294
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,122
Speaker 0: It's way bigger than every other con Isn't there?

295
00:19:57,183 --> 00:20:01,440
Speaker 0: like a security or a person in the panel room who would be like who are you getting off?

296
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,244
Speaker 1: He was the security.

297
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,015
Speaker 1: He was the official staffer in charge of the room.

298
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:07,420
Speaker 0: There's only one staffer in the room.

299
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:22,840
Speaker 1: Well, he he was in charge, I guess and basically as often happens You know the women on the panel didn't want to like make a scene and they were polite and they tried to sort of walk Him back into letting them talk and he just took over the whole thing.

300
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,620
Speaker 1: It was a super shit bird and this happens kind of often at nerd cons.

301
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:31,400
Speaker 1: But it's sad that it happened at SDCC because how do their staff work?

302
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,808
Speaker 1: Like is it just volunteered like shit lords?

303
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,420
Speaker 0: or did I know the organization that runs the convention?

304
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,530
Speaker 0: Is it like, you know, like what it like?

305
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:46,579
Speaker 1: I don't know how the SDCC is organized but I this sort of crap would not fly at a convention that I have power over.

306
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:51,337
Speaker 1: and It's kind of terrible and sad that SDCC is so unprofessional.

307
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:59,308
Speaker 0: I get packs it's like and it's unthinkable that like an enforcer would ever like say anything other than here's where to sit or Panels over.

308
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:00,157
Speaker 0: everyone leave.

309
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:11,939
Speaker 1: Yep and I have been on panels where at Conventions where the convention staff appointed a moderator and said moderator didn't know shit and was just Basically made the panel worse as opposed to better.

310
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:18,159
Speaker 1: But I've mostly gotten around that by moderating my own panels when we do panels if it comes up.

311
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:23,220
Speaker 1: But yeah, this you can read the whole story here and the women involved kind of tell the story fully.

312
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:27,047
Speaker 1: I don't want to put words in their mouth, but Shame on you SDCC.

313
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,914
Speaker 1: Like this is baby's first mistake.

314
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:30,340
Speaker 1: Why was this guy staff?

315
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:33,960
Speaker 1: Why did you even let him talk on this panel?

316
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:52,838
Speaker 1: And if you're gonna appoint someone to be a moderator or facilitator for a women in X panel Should probably have the moderator be a woman just saying anyway things Of the day.

317
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,690
Speaker 1: So this is pretty amazing.

318
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:58,001
Speaker 1: This happened at SDCC.

319
00:21:58,021 --> 00:22:00,249
Speaker 0: I was everything today is from SDCC.

320
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:03,779
Speaker 1: Yep, so the creators of Rick and Morty there's.

321
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,705
Speaker 1: there's a famous court transcript that FARC loves the shit out of and I'm gonna link to that too.

322
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,614
Speaker 1: It's just images of this.

323
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:12,557
Speaker 1: This is a real case.

Speaker 1: Yes, and he is accusing the court-appointed lawyer of Demanding that he sucked the court-appointed court-appointed lawyer's dick and all sorts of craziness.

329
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:52,109
Speaker 1: Hey, so the guy who's accused of murder is demanding a different lawyer is because he says the first lawyer Tried to make him suck his dick.

Speaker 0: he says that the Public defender that was assigned to defend him and make him not go to jail asked him.

338
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:27,753

Speaker 0: I mean shouldn't mr Allen go to the like the ward and not the prison?

375
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:42,242
Speaker 1: but my thing of the day is that the voice actors and creative team behind Rick and Morty voice acted the entire Transcripts to an animatic isn't there?

376
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:43,830
Speaker 0: Can't we just watch a video of the original?

377
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:46,183
Speaker 1: I don't believe there is a video of the original.

378
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:47,210
Speaker 1: There's just the transcripts.

379
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:50,564
Speaker 0: Is there like a nice pastel drawing by a court artist?

380
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:51,749

00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:35,203
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's definitely having his mug shot taken after doing the drugs.

401
00:25:53,001 --> 00:26:03,670
Speaker 0: This guy has a pretty clever stick He basically he looks like Doctor Who and I don't know even a fan of Doctor Who and I know that he looks like One of the Doctor Who's cuz he got the bow tie in the in the curly fro hair.

402
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:08,462
Speaker 0: But he basically he says that he is you know Superman's little friend.

403
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:08,763
Speaker 0: What's it?

404

Speaker 0: Oh The little reporter kid.

406
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:14,790
Speaker 0: I don't remember that guy's name Jimmy Olsen.

407
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:20,390
Speaker 0: He basically pretends to be Jimmy Olsen and he goes around asking people at the Comic Con a question, right?

408
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:23,310
Speaker 0: And he asked everyone the same question to make a funny video.

409
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,682
Speaker 0: So sometimes he has a wide variety of people in this video.

410
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:28,810
Speaker 0: He asked a guy cosplaying as Robin.

411
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:32,429
Speaker 0: He asked like just normal people just at her that are at the Comic Con.

412
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:36,152
Speaker 0: He asked Natasha Allegri the only famous person in the thing I recognized.

413
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:38,719
Speaker 0: ah, right and he asked them all the same question.

414
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,290
Speaker 0: The question he asked is who for president?

415
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:46,449
Speaker 0: Donald Trump or Lex Luthor?

416
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:48,514
Speaker 1: Definitely Lex Luthor.

417
00:26:48,795 --> 00:26:49,939
Speaker 0: Everyone picks Lex Luthor.

418
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,624
Speaker 0: So I don't think all right.

419
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:55,080
Speaker 0: So the reason I'm making this thing of the day Is because a it's a good video.

420
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,502
Speaker 0: It's funny.

421
00:26:55,562 --> 00:27:04,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, but also be Every single nerdy person on Twitter and Facebook and such who spends all day complaining about Donald Trump.

422
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:07,059
Speaker 0: None of the nerds are voting for Donald Trump.

423
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,850
Speaker 0: Nobody following you is gonna vote for Donald Trump.

424
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:11,512
Speaker 1: Unfollow me.

425
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:17,930
Speaker 0: it is completely pointless for you to tweet that nonsense because you're not talking to anyone who disagrees with that nonsense.

426
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:26,103
Speaker 0: If you want to talk about how awful Donald Trump is Put it somewhere besides my Twitter feed because I'm not voting for him either.

427
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:28,830
Speaker 0: You're completely wasting your breath on this.

428
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:29,786
Speaker 1: God, you're gonna get.

429
00:27:32,914 --> 00:27:37,810
Speaker 0: Keep it on Facebook where you might have crazy relatives that will be upset.

430
00:27:38,312 --> 00:27:39,075
Speaker 0: Keep it off Twitter.

431
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:42,289
Speaker 1: if I had a Facebook my goal would be to get all those people to block me.

432
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:45,802
Speaker 1: I don't think I have any relatives who are those people on Facebook though.

433
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:47,126
Speaker 0: Don't know how to block.

434
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,879
Speaker 1: Oh True.

435
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:49,690
Speaker 0: They don't know how.

436

Speaker 0: Right, so right and they feel obligated.

437
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:57,063

438
00:27:57,103 --> 00:27:59,069
Speaker 0: They can't they can't bring themselves to do that.

439
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:01,097
Speaker 1: I had to put it up with that a little bit over.

440
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,967
Speaker 0: that's why Facebook is even more that than Twitter.

441
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:06,716
Speaker 0: but Twitter people Just stick to the nerdiness.

442
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:08,443
Speaker 0: there's no point in those tweets.

443
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:13,169
Speaker 0: look not a single nerd Right is on the wrong side of the board here.

444
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:17,010
Speaker 0: Well, that's because the choice and the only people following you on Twitter are nerds.

445
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:25,137
Speaker 1: how many of those nerds are gonna throw their vote away on like Jill Stein's crazy anti-vaxxer or What's his name's libertarian nonsense?

446
00:28:25,277 --> 00:28:28,390
Speaker 0: Every one of these nerds is throwing their vote away on Lex Luthor, which is perfectly fine.

447
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:34,201
Speaker 1: But if we all throw our vote away on Lex Luthor in my win That's good, yeah, I would be okay with Lex Luthor.

450
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,315

Speaker 1: Bella like disappears forever.

502
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,513
Speaker 1: And then every now and then some characters like I gotta get out of town cuz shit's going crazy And they go to.

503
00:30:57,554 --> 00:30:59,907
Speaker 0: Bella happens to be in the stable in this town.

512
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:30,590
Speaker 1: So if we do PAX Australia, it means I'm gonna be home for two weeks and then fly right back to Australia.

513
00:31:31,353 --> 00:31:33,369
Speaker 1: I can't quite take a month and a half off work.

514
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:36,214
Speaker 0: Kind of want to go somewhere else.

515
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:37,497
Speaker 0: someplace has a palm tree.

516
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:42,651
Speaker 1: We're thinking about doing a giant s and extravaganza in 2018.

517
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,113
Speaker 0: That's fine.

518
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:43,514
Speaker 0: I need to 2016 2017.

519
00:31:43,514 --> 00:31:44,296
Speaker 0: I won't go anywhere in 2016.

520
00:31:44,296 --> 00:31:45,280
Speaker 0: I want to go someplace as a palm tree.

521
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:51,516
Speaker 1: Just go to slightly.

522
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:54,128
Speaker 1: no go to pack sauce and then go slightly further north after it.

523
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:58,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe go to like Brisbane or Cairn or whatever.

524
00:31:58,184 --> 00:31:59,147
Speaker 1: those places are up top.

525
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,634
Speaker 1: There's the only two places I know up top.

526
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,447
Speaker 0: I can go someplace in this hemisphere though.

527
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:06,889
Speaker 0: No It's faster to get there and have more palm tree time.

528
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:16,150
Speaker 1: We're working our way through all the anime that we already reviewed when we did our judge anime by its cover At anime Boston and this is yet one more of those flying which?

529
00:32:17,272 --> 00:32:31,340
Speaker 0: It's in the genres of according to anime news network comedy Magic slice of life slice of life Anything that's quiet which is anything that's quiet gets a slice of life Genre attached to it if I like it.

530
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,544
Speaker 1: I watch like four episodes.

531
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:33,910
Speaker 1: I think I'll watch the rest of it.

532
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:38,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I watched a few episodes and then they were like at the start of the season.

533
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,222
Speaker 0: I started watching a bunch of shows and I finished that lost village one.

534
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:53,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I'm one episode or two from finishing Sakamoto, I know not to finish the lost village one and I only watched a few episodes of Little Witch And I kind of wanted to watch more.

535
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:59,842
Speaker 0: but the thing is the show is So episodic and there wasn't a driving plot.

536
00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:04,605
Speaker 0: that like made me eager to see the next episode Even though I enjoyed the episodes I saw.

537
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:10,470
Speaker 0: Yeah Make me want to watch more but that's not true.

538
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,658
Speaker 0: I for example I was among a dial.

539
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:19,329
Speaker 0: another show that people call a slice of life show whether it is or isn't Made me want to watch more episodes every time they came out.

540
00:33:20,173 --> 00:33:24,510
Speaker 1: I think the problem with the show or the release the reason you're not driven to it cuz I really like the show.

541
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:33,303
Speaker 1: I like it too is that it does move real slow and it's like every episode is 40% magic and that magic part is great.

542
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:36,746
Speaker 1: and 60% Making tempera.

543
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:42,365
Speaker 1: Then exquisite and excruciating detail with some stuff that they picked off the side of the road.

544
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:46,081
Speaker 1: and you see like now They're washing the things now.

545
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:47,530
Speaker 1: They're making the tempera oil.

546
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:50,770
Speaker 1: Oh, hey, you can tell when the oil is ready if you put the chopsticks anyway.

547
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:53,650
Speaker 0: Usually when you have an episode it's a full-length episodes.

548
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,070
Speaker 1: It's not a short show like only one magic thing happens per episode, right?

549
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,234
Speaker 0: Well full-length episodes.

550
00:33:58,415 --> 00:34:03,495
Speaker 0: usually even in a Simpsons episode you have two or three plots Intertwining right.

551
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:06,366
Speaker 0: that then come together at the end of the a and the B right.

552
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:12,188
Speaker 0: or in even you know Lost Village which we talked about before there's a bunch of different characters that all have plot lines to jump to.

553
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:18,150
Speaker 0: in Little witch there's only one characters plot line, which is the little witch's plot line, right?

554
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,909
Speaker 0: The other characters are just side characters.

555
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:26,070
Speaker 0: So with only one plot you've got one thread and everything else is just atmosphere environment around it, which is all nice.

556
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,302
Speaker 0: It's a really nice environment and such.

557
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:34,306
Speaker 0: like the animations good the care Not enough stuff in one episode to carry 20 minutes.

558
00:34:35,612 --> 00:34:39,664
Speaker 0: So you spend a lot of time watching tempera cook, right?

559
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:46,268
Speaker 0: or the things that happen are Done in more detail and take longer like how long did it take her to pull that?

560
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,606
Speaker 1: The mandrake out of the ground is worth it because the payoff on the mandrake.

561
00:34:50,786 --> 00:34:52,154
Speaker 0: No, that was great But it's like.

562
00:34:52,194 --> 00:34:53,844
Speaker 0: how long did that whole scene take?

563
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:54,610
Speaker 0: you could have done that soon.

564
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,829
Speaker 1: She's trying to weave the farm and she's like and pulls the weed out and falls in her butt and goes, right?

565
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:00,650
Speaker 1: I almost pulls the weed out again.

566
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:06,550
Speaker 0: I almost wish that like the dude character or maybe the mom or the little the sit.

567
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:08,255
Speaker 0: You know the cousin a little cousin.

568
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:12,349
Speaker 0: we're like also a main character and you could just get two plots in one episode.

569
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:17,125
Speaker 1: Yep, or Those characters just need to have like even if you don't see their plots.

570
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:18,190
Speaker 1: They just need more going on.

571
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,001
Speaker 1: They're all just really because they're all.

572
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:20,323
Speaker 0: they're all.

573
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:21,570
Speaker 0: everyone is a side character.

574
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,277
Speaker 0: They only come in and come out and come in.

575
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:28,675
Speaker 0: They're never like the main focus, you know All the thing though.

576
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:33,295
Speaker 0: to their credit though every single character even the minute every character is great Like.

577
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:36,073
Speaker 0: there's no characters who were like all lame character I don't care about.

578
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,686
Speaker 1: like there's a suspicious girl who's worried about the fact that she knows about which is.

579
00:35:39,907 --> 00:35:44,205
Speaker 1: there's the little sister Who's dubious but also into it the witch's sister who's like the ultimate?

580
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,815
Speaker 0: Yeah She ever.

581
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:54,210
Speaker 1: their relationship reminds me of a like 90% deluded version of Lena inverse and her older sister, right?

582
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:56,778
Speaker 0: You get like the the one episode.

583
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,786
Speaker 0: weird guy who cut like weird.

584
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:01,556
Speaker 0: which dude, you know Who's magical and doesn't say anything.

585
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:02,218
Speaker 0: who comes in?

586
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,383
Speaker 0: It's not like a no face.

587
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:05,490
Speaker 1: You've got the harbinger who is just funny.

588
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:09,196
Speaker 1: I like him a lot because he's like, uh Come on, I'm not scary.

589
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:09,718
Speaker 1: What's up?

590
00:36:09,758 --> 00:36:10,321
Speaker 0: Come on.

591
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:10,642
Speaker 1: Come on.

592
00:36:10,663 --> 00:36:11,306
Speaker 1: Let me in.

593
00:36:11,326 --> 00:36:12,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the guy.

594
00:36:13,013 --> 00:36:16,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's surprising how emotive his face is for being just two holes.

595
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:20,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, a little owl nose of the girl who accidentally turned herself into a dog.

596
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:25,229
Speaker 0: It's like every single character is like way cool.

597
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,718
Speaker 0: You know There's just not enough stuff happening to where.

598
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:38,639
Speaker 0: I can like keep my attention on it for more than an episode at a time now Eccentric family and on the surface moves similarly slow.

599
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:40,924
Speaker 0: eccentric family is but a better show.

600
00:36:40,944 --> 00:36:46,830
Speaker 1: eccentric family is dense with Things other than just what happens in the episode.

601
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:52,369
Speaker 0: Okay, first of all eccentric family has like four different plot lines going on right to pay attention to.

602
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:56,202
Speaker 0: It also has tons of mystery and suspense and action.

603
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:58,510
Speaker 1: Those are things that this show does not have.

604
00:36:58,731 --> 00:37:00,396
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't have any of those things right?

605
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:01,922
Speaker 0: This show is like you.

606
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:04,210
Speaker 0: just take one slice of eccentric family.

607
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:10,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, right the cute tanuki part only and the rest of it is just let's temper this stuff on the side.

608
00:37:11,113 --> 00:37:17,840
Speaker 0: Don't take the ones from the utility pole because the show is really good But it's a show only for a certain mood.

609
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,548
Speaker 0: It's not a show for all seasons.

610
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:23,650
Speaker 1: Yep It's a show you put on like sitting there idle before you like cook dinner or something.

611
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:23,971
Speaker 1: And even

612
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:41,958
Speaker 0: though it's a show that takes place in the summer because it's all about this witch who goes To stay with her family a different part of her family during the summer, right or whatever Only temporarily or something this show I think is best watched in winter when you're cooped up in the house Yeah, and you want a summer vibe?

613
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,970
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz why did you put the show out in the summer?

614
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:48,484
Speaker 0: I guess because it goes with summer but now watch it in the winter to warm yourself up.

615
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:54,450
Speaker 1: I would also say that the show Reminds like on the surface detail like just looking at the cover art and everything.

616
00:37:54,993 --> 00:38:08,210
Speaker 1: It reminds me of some days dreamers, which when I saw it way back I was like, ooh, that's gonna be a kind of show I like and I remember some days dreamers was so boring Didn't go anywhere and I just didn't care and I watched one episode.

617
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:16,866
Speaker 1: I just never watched the rest of it and I feel like this is Better and that I will watch the rest of it, but I don't know when I'll finish watching.

618
00:38:16,886 --> 00:38:18,552
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know when It's sort of like.

619
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,861
Speaker 0: it's a really good.

620
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,085
Speaker 0: It's like butter.

621
00:38:22,326 --> 00:38:23,370
Speaker 0: It's really delicious.

622
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:24,394
Speaker 1: You don't want to eat.

623
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:28,910
Speaker 0: just it got spread way thin and it's gonna take you a long time to eat it all.

624
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:35,210
Speaker 1: Yep, and meanwhile, there's like hero Academy or one punch man or all those other shows that it's just cocaine right in your face.

625
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:37,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean one punch man.

626
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:39,874
Speaker 0: I watched like Faster than it came out.

627
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:42,221
Speaker 1: Yeah, right the show is if I didn't read it.

628
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:42,643
Speaker 1: It's just.

629
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:45,190
Speaker 1: it's pleasant and inoffensive.

630
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:57,110
Speaker 1: Mmm, nothing real bad to say about it, except it's not particularly Like another show that we've complained about a long time ago cosine or Jimbo that you start to watch it.

631
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,554
Speaker 1: It's also slow.

632
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:01,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it doesn't have characters you care about.

633
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think nothing happens.

634
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:06,809
Speaker 0: You can't tell what's happening and you don't care.

635
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:11,714
Speaker 0: So it's like the same pace as guys know Jimbo only with good stuff It's not a bad like.

636
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:17,541
Speaker 1: imagine if every character because they know your Jimbo were awesome But the show otherwise went the same pace that it went.

637
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:18,586
Speaker 1: I probably would have watched it.

638
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,068
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

639
00:39:19,872 --> 00:39:21,080
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'll watch the rest of this.

640
00:39:21,181 --> 00:39:21,563
Speaker 1: whenever.

641
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:25,924
Speaker 1: I only watch the first four I only saw up to the girl who got drunk and accidentally turned herself into a dog.

Speaker 1: I gotta watch.

647
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:35,383
