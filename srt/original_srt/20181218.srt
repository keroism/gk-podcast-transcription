1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,282
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, December 18th, 2018.

2
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:13,751
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:14,280
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,344
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:18,400
Speaker 1: Tonight, it took us way more takes to do that opening than it should have.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,300
Speaker 1: And we're talking about the new Smash Brothers.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,320
Speaker 1: Because what else are we going to talk about?

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,220
Speaker 0: The Ultimate Smash Brothers.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,780
Speaker 1: There's an Ultimate Smash Brothers.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,778
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

11
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,129
Speaker 1: So it's gaming day.

12
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:30,160
Speaker 1: I'm not going to belabor the point.

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,980
Speaker 1: We're going to review this on an episode of Geek Nights at some point in the near future.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,698
Speaker 1: I assume because Scott will probably go see it.

15
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:43,320
Speaker 1: Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is, in my opinion, having seen it last night in the theater, the best superhero movie ever made.

16
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:44,800
Speaker 1: Or at least in the top five.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,080
Speaker 0: It's not exactly a high hurdle to get over.

18
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:48,747
Speaker 1: I did not say it was a high hurdle.

19
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:51,480
Speaker 1: I'm just simply saying that this movie got over that hurdle.

20
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:55,399
Speaker 1: However low that bar was, this movie easily jumped it.

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:07,479
Speaker 0: An even lower hurdle that I'm sure, not even having seen it, I can almost guarantee that, I don't know if it's the best superhero movie ever, because there are superhero movies that say Unbreakable, which are actually good.

22
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:11,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're technically superhero movies.

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:24,499
Speaker 0: I can easily wager money, easily, no question, that it is the best Spider-Man, not just movie, any video Spider-Man thing.

24
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:27,299
Speaker 1: Spider-Man media that moves.

25
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:29,099
Speaker 0: That's not a comic book.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,000
Speaker 1: This movie is fucking phenomenal.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,640
Speaker 1: I would say it is one of the best movies.

28
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:40,322
Speaker 1: It is one of the best movies, animated or not, superhero or not, of 2018.

29
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:42,000
Speaker 1: I will stand by that statement.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,500
Speaker 1: I kind of want to go see it in the theater again.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,800
Speaker 0: I'm probably going to go on Christmas, because that's what you do on Christmas.

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,477
Speaker 0: You go see a movie.

33
00:01:48,361 --> 00:02:00,320
Speaker 1: The reason I'm really driving this home is that, Free and Geek Nights, Scott hasn't seen the movie yet, but I have, we are usually pretty cynical about things and usually pretty right about things.

34
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,120
Speaker 1: When I go into something, I tend to have low to middling expectations.

35
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:11,740
Speaker 1: When I went into this movie, based on the buzz I saw, I came in with pretty high expectations.

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:20,720
Speaker 1: When I have high expectations, maybe two or three times in my entire life have those high expectations been exceeded by anything.

37
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:25,339
Speaker 1: This movie is really, really good, and you should go see it.

38
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:29,700
Speaker 1: I still cannot think of even one complaint I have about it.

39
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:32,856
Speaker 0: I just wanted to see it, because it's got my boy Spider-Man 2099 in it.

40
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,871
Speaker 0: If people don't know, Spider-Man 2099 is a comic book from the 90s, when I was like 10 or so.

41
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:45,760
Speaker 0: That was the comic that I bought from issue one every single month.

42
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,889
Speaker 0: I think I have all of them now.

43
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:48,079
Speaker 0: I have every issue.

44
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,356
Speaker 0: I might have redundant issues.

45
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,800
Speaker 1: That's the Cyberpunk Spider-Man.

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,460
Speaker 0: That is the comic book that made me learn Cyberpunk things, because I read it way before I read, say, William Gibson novels.

47
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:09,200
Speaker 0: That's why when people were talking about Cyberpunk stuff, even though I hadn't read any William Gibson novels, I knew what the hell they were talking about, even without seeing a Blade Runner.

48
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:15,341
Speaker 0: Also, people don't know this, because most people probably haven't read Spider-Man 2099.

49
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,389
Speaker 0: Spider-Man 2099 is a huge asshole.

50
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,979
Speaker 0: He's not nice like the other Spider-Man's.

51
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:29,640
Speaker 0: He's basically this piece of shit, super genius, geneticist guy, who ends up in his own experiment that combines his DNA with a spider.

52
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:33,152
Speaker 0: He's just an ass to everybody.

53
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,720
Speaker 0: He's not a good person.

54
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:43,618
Speaker 1: This movie also, if you can see it in 3D, it is one of the best uses of 3D I've ever seen in a movie.

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,585
Speaker 0: I really wish.

56
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:46,357
Speaker 0: Just a side note quickly about the 3D.

57
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,897
Speaker 0: He went to Disney World, and they had Honey, I Shrunk the Audience and Muppet 3D.

58
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:53,109
Speaker 0: And the Terminator 1 at Universal.

59
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,657
Speaker 0: They really went full on with the 3D.

60
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,778
Speaker 0: And that shit was in the 90s, where they had full power 3D, poking you in the face, really messing with you.

61
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:09,340
Speaker 0: Really pushing 3D to the limit in terms of making it a thing that mattered.

62
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,680
Speaker 0: And no 3D movies that are in the theaters these days are doing that stuff.

63
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:19,720
Speaker 1: If I had to rank movies that I have seen in 3D that use 3D effectively...

64
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,260
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, I want Muppets 3D, 90 minutes at least, instead of the 10 minutes it is.

65
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,814
Speaker 0: It's not very long if you go to Disney World.

66
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:27,599
Speaker 0: If it's even still there.

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,300
Speaker 1: This movie is so beautifully animated, it is shocking.

68
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,700
Speaker 0: Right, but does it have things constantly come and poke you in the face?

69
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:38,040
Speaker 1: I guess the best one, because I don't want to spoil stuff.

70
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,639
Speaker 1: It has a couple eye pokes, but not that many.

71
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,560
Speaker 0: Better than the zero that you get in a 3D Star Wars.

72
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:56,880
Speaker 1: The thing is, it is very 3D, and because it was animated, every time anything is in 3D in any capacity, someone decided, I want this part to be in 3D like this for a reason.

73
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,320
Speaker 0: It wasn't a 2D conversion deal?

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,532
Speaker 1: Nope, this movie is 3D 3D.

75
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,659
Speaker 0: That's good.

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,159
Speaker 1: The only movie I've ever seen...

77
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,260
Speaker 0: That's pretty much how I decided.

78
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,319
Speaker 0: If it was made in 3D with 3D cameras on the set, then I'll go see it in 3D.

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,500
Speaker 1: See, I do the opposite.

80
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:10,960
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

81
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,173
Speaker 0: You want to go see the 3D conversions?

82
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,800
Speaker 1: There's three kinds of 3D movies.

83
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,880
Speaker 1: This is kind of a sidetrack.

84
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:16,518
Speaker 1: There's three kinds.

85
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:17,340
Speaker 1: There's three kinds.

86
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:17,958
Speaker 0: Cut it out.

87
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,420
Speaker 0: Cut it out.

88
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:18,857
Speaker 0: Cut it out.

89
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,179
Speaker 1: Five is right out.

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,378
Speaker 1: So, the first kind is, they film it in 3D, and then they show it in 2D or 3D.

91
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:32,840
Speaker 1: Those movies tend to not use 3D very well, because they're just accurately representing whatever 3D was happening in the filming.

92
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,700
Speaker 1: They're not using the 3D for its own artistic device.

93
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:37,059
Speaker 1: Kind of just a gimmick.

94
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:41,780
Speaker 1: Tends to not be that good, or tends to just, at best, not be distracting.

95
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:43,860
Speaker 1: Doesn't add to the movie, usually.

96
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:47,497
Speaker 1: Then, there's the, take a movie that was made in 2D.

97
00:05:48,402 --> 00:05:49,120
Speaker 0: The 2D cameras.

98
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:49,520
Speaker 1: Yep.

99
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,039
Speaker 1: Or, was shot with 3D cameras, but intended to be 2D, and they only shoot with 3D cameras if you're making a 2D movie.

100
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,040
Speaker 1: To make it easy to make the 3D version.

101
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,659
Speaker 0: You just need a lot more light, and it's harder to make the movie.

102
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,840
Speaker 1: But, a lot of movies will make a 3D version that nobody wanted.

103
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,339
Speaker 1: There's no artistic reason to do it.

104
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,359
Speaker 1: Usually, from 3D to 2D shooting, just so they can release it in the theater, in 3D, in charge of people more money for it.

105
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:13,318
Speaker 1: Those are the worst.

106
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:26,000
Speaker 1: But then, there's the movies where, like Mad Max, which was not shot in 3D to be a 3D movie, the new Mad Max, but 3D was added in post on purpose for artistic reasons.

107
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:30,536
Speaker 1: And, it was done, like, scene by scene for the same kinds of reasons.

108
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:32,840
Speaker 1: you do color grading, and it's phenomenal.

109
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,519
Speaker 1: Mad Max Fury Road and this Spiderman are easily two of the best uses of 3D in movies I've ever seen.

110
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,879
Speaker 0: They're not better than that Terminator thing, or... No, that's different.

111
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:43,960
Speaker 0: In terms of 3D-ness.

112
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is, those are different.

113
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,197
Speaker 0: Just the 3D aspect of them.

114
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,859
Speaker 1: You know what I'd say?

115
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,498
Speaker 1: The different one.

116
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:52,840
Speaker 1: Those don't hold up that well, like those experiences to our modern sensibilities.

117
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:54,880
Speaker 0: I don't think any of them are still there.

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,539
Speaker 0: I don't think Honey I Shrunk the Audience is still there.

119
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,659
Speaker 1: But, two, I would say that those are more like in VR.

120
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,379
Speaker 1: There's home VR, and then there's installation VR.

121
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,679
Speaker 1: Those are installation 3D, as opposed to...

122
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:09,740
Speaker 0: They were just movie theaters with 3D glasses.

123
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:11,500
Speaker 1: No, they also had physical effects.

124
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:12,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, but those weren't necessary.

125
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:14,460
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought you wanted full on.

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,238
Speaker 0: Let's go all the way.

127
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:15,864
Speaker 0: 4D.

128
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, with the 3D part.

129
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,940
Speaker 0: We don't need the spraying water on you part when the dog sneezes.

130
00:07:20,142 --> 00:07:20,780
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah you do.

131
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,297
Speaker 0: No, you don't.

132
00:07:22,003 --> 00:07:22,216
Speaker 1: Anyway...

133
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,440
Speaker 0: I mean, if you want to put that in every movie theater, be my guest.

134
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:25,240
Speaker 0: I think we should.

135
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:26,579
Speaker 0: It's gonna get really gross.

136
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,179
Speaker 0: As all the wet seats and shit.

137
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:29,516
Speaker 1: Yup.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,020
Speaker 1: Anyway, go see Spiderman.

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,458
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

140
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,519
Speaker 1: So, got some news.

141
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:34,080
Speaker 0: Alright.

142
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,500
Speaker 1: And the news is... Well, I guess we'll do this one first.

143
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,180
Speaker 1: So, everyone wants to get on the PUBG Fortnite train.

144
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,180
Speaker 0: Well, this is what happens in the gaming world.

145
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,000
Speaker 0: Well, this will always happen in the gaming world, right?

146
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,659
Speaker 0: Ever since the oldest olden day is someone makes a video game and then someone makes Space Invaders and then what?

147
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,280
Speaker 0: Someone else makes a game that looks just like Space Invaders.

148
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,179
Speaker 1: Space Invaders.

149
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:57,880
Speaker 0: Then they made Mario and then there's Giana Sisters.

150
00:07:58,384 --> 00:07:58,677
Speaker 0: Right?

151
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:07,820
Speaker 0: It's like someone comes up with a new genre of video game, say an RTS, like, you know, Dune 2, and then you get a Command & Conquer and you get a Warcraft and you get, right?

152
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:22,180
Speaker 0: So, someone comes up with an FPS, like, say a Doom, and then you get a Quake and you get a Doom 3D and you get, you know, it's like, okay, so, here you go, PUBG came out with a PUBG and then there was a Fortnite and then there was an era and then so and so.

153
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,760
Speaker 1: Now, I guess my problem, like, it's kind of bad, like, I played it, I got second place in my first game, like, game's not hard, it's easy to kill people.

154
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,620
Speaker 0: It's the same as Counter-Strike.

155
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:31,780
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

156
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:33,498
Speaker 0: Oh, by the way, there's a Counter-Strike PUBG.

157
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's Counter-Strike PUBG.

158
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:36,440
Speaker 1: Battle Royale mode.

159
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,738
Speaker 1: But the thing is, I really like Counter-Strike and I'm okay at Counter-Strike, even to this day, somehow.

160
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,040
Speaker 1: But the problem is, this game doesn't feel like Counter-Strike at all.

161
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,918
Speaker 0: What I expect... The shooting part does.

162
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,856
Speaker 1: Barely.

163
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,239
Speaker 0: Also, good luck getting a gun.

164
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:52,378
Speaker 0: That's Waldag, yeah.

165
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,640
Speaker 1: The problem, the problems with this game...

166
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:57,220
Speaker 0: I got an AUG and then died immediately once.

167
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,620
Speaker 1: Oh my god, if I got an AUG in that game, I'd be unstoppable.

168
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is, I picked up the AUG and I was loading it and I got shot in the back.

169
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:10,265
Speaker 1: Even if I got one pistol, I just... Most people seem to look at that tablet and be like, "Oh shit, there's people near me, I'm

170
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:10,553
Speaker 1: afraid.".

171
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:14,880
Speaker 1: If I look at that tablet, all it tells me is where I'm gonna go fucking kill some people.

172
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:26,058
Speaker 1: But the problem is, the reason it doesn't feel like Counter-Strike, what I expected was, everyone lands, you all have P90s and crap, go for it, it's just Icy World on a giant map.

173
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:27,140
Speaker 1: That's all I wanted.

174
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:38,244
Speaker 1: But this, is you start with just your fists, and there's all these bullshitty mini-games like, "Oh, collect dollars in briefcases and order a bullet from a drone that'll deliver to

175
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:38,429
Speaker 1: you.".

176
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,000
Speaker 0: And then someone else can hear and see the drone, and then they come after you.

177
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,020
Speaker 0: I've never seen a hostage.

178
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,660
Speaker 0: People talked about them, I've never seen one.

179
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,220
Speaker 1: I found a hostage and I picked him up and I took him somewhere and it gave me so little money that it didn't matter.

180
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,111
Speaker 1: Basically, they added all this crap to the game.

181
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,800
Speaker 1: that has nothing to do with the good part of Counter-Strike.

182
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,100
Speaker 0: Just shooting people in the head.

183
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, the good part of Counter-Strike is that feeling you get firing that P90, it's just pop pop pop, go go go.

184
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:02,720
Speaker 1: This is the opposite of that.

185
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,971
Speaker 0: Well, it's pop pop pop, go go, but it's panicking.

186
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:09,334
Speaker 0: pop pop pop, go go, because you have nothing and someone else probably has a gun, and what do you do?

187
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,559
Speaker 0: You look at your fucking tablet and now someone could kill you while you're messing around with it, trying to figure it out.

188
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,459
Speaker 1: But the problem is, Counter-Strike is not made for this.

189
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,780
Speaker 1: So when they start, so one, the draw distance messes up, so like you can't actually see people in the distance effectively, nor does cover work effectively.

190
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,220
Speaker 0: And there's not that many people, it's not a hundred people on the map.

191
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:28,880
Speaker 0: It's like 16, right?

192
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a lot of people.

193
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:39,778
Speaker 1: But the other trouble with it, oh, and you can get trapped, the maps aren't that well designed, so like the closing circle will just trap you sometimes, like literally no way out.

194
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not great.

195
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,020
Speaker 0: But also- Also, I couldn't tell where the circle was and shit, because the map is really confusing.

196
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:51,619
Speaker 1: I started to figure it out, but the real problem is it starts you with just fists, and it's a really long-.

197
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,680
Speaker 0: I punched someone to death, I also clubbed someone to death with a wrench.

198
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:56,180
Speaker 1: I've used a knife to kill a bunch of people.

199
00:10:56,441 --> 00:11:03,400
Speaker 0: There was someone, I was stabbing with a knife, and after I died, obviously I didn't kill them, I looked, it shows you like your stats.

200
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:06,880
Speaker 0: They literally had like, I did like 99 damage to them.

201
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:09,179
Speaker 0: One more swipe, they would have been dead.

202
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:18,980
Speaker 0: They managed to, while I was stabbing them repeatedly, finish loading an ump, so I don't know where they got it from, turn it on me and find like two bullets, because it was the start of the game, I had nothing.

203
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,938
Speaker 0: I don't know where the ump came from.

204
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,719
Speaker 1: But here's the problem, they start you with fists, right?

205
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,620
Speaker 1: The fit, like the melee mechanics of Counter-Strike, have never been good.

206
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,459
Speaker 0: No, knife fight is for silliness, it's not for serious.

207
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't actually use a knife.

208
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:45,500
Speaker 1: So basically, they took all the not fun parts of Counter-Strike, amplified them, took the fun parts, like unloading on someone with a P90, made them almost impossible to achieve, and then added a bunch of fiddly mini-games.

209
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:47,739
Speaker 1: I don't know who designed this.

210
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,718
Speaker 1: The reason that- Who is this for?

211
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:59,326
Speaker 0: At least from my perspective, the reason that Battle Royale games are popular, right, is the same reason that people play in RTS and are like, "Don't attack me for like ten minutes and I'll

212
00:11:59,368 --> 00:11:59,675
Speaker 0: build."

213
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,140
Speaker 0: Right?

214
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:02,360
Speaker 0: And that's what the PUBG games are.

215
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,620
Speaker 1: But the beauty of Counter-Strike is that you start with everything already.

216
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:06,098
Speaker 0: Right.

217
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:31,979
Speaker 0: The PUBG games and the other Fortnite games, what they're about is, it's quiet, the map is big, and even though there's a lot of people, right, we can all sit around leveling up collecting items and getting gear and have that fun, the same fun you have, just building a little Starcraft base with no one messing with you, right, and then you're going to have to encounter at least someone maybe early on, but it's only maybe going to be like one person because the map is so big.

218
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,534
Speaker 0: And if you want to, you can land in the crowded area.

219
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:37,140
Speaker 0: if you want to have that fun too, right?

220
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:37,675
Speaker 0: It's up to you.

221
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,320
Speaker 0: But, you know, most people, and this does not offer either of those experiences.

222
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:55,160
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to land in the same place as someone else, so you can't go for that immediate fight, and there's only 16 people and the map isn't that big, so you can't have a million years to mess around and get a whole bunch of weapons before you see someone.

223
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,800
Speaker 0: You can't do either one.

224
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,420
Speaker 1: And the ways to get weapons are these just not fun add-ons to Counter-Strike.

225
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,760
Speaker 0: The two fun modes of the Battle Royale games are not available in the Counter-Strike Battle Royale game.

226
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,039
Speaker 0: And I guess you could say that's good because it's different, but it's bad because it's not fun.

227
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:10,399
Speaker 1: I don't know who this is for.

228
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,220
Speaker 1: Anyone who's good at Counter-Strike will just be frustrated by this.

229
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:18,259
Speaker 0: It's for Valve to be like, "Uh, we're really losing our FPS market to

230
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:18,459
Speaker 0: these.".

231
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:21,860
Speaker 1: Valve is not doing well with its games lately.

232
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,260
Speaker 0: Because they stopped making them.

233
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,120
Speaker 0: You got to, right?

234
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:32,200
Speaker 0: By not continuously making games, we talk about this a lot where it's like, "Well, we don't need new submarines.

235
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:32,548
Speaker 0: We have

236
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:32,875
Speaker 0: plenty.".

237
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you're not continuously making a new submarine all the time, you lose the intelligence of making submarines.

238
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
Speaker 0: And if you say, "All right, we don't need a new one for 50 years.

239
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,076
Speaker 0: Just 50 years later, hey, we need a new submarine now," there's no one alive who has any expertise in making them.

240
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,139
Speaker 1: Yep, good game.

241
00:13:48,400 --> 00:14:00,771
Speaker 0: So, Valve, there's plenty of expertise in making plenty games and FPSs, but Valve has not been continuously making games since they made Dota and Artifact not doing great, relatively speaking.

242
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:05,420
Speaker 0: So, they sort of are not the studio they used to be in terms of game making.

243
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,220
Speaker 0: They have a bunch of experts at Steam making.

244
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,193
Speaker 0: But the one good thing they did- And they're even being assaulted on that front now.

245
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,531
Speaker 1: Yeah.

246
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,500
Speaker 1: Well, because Counter-Strike's not keeping up either with these other games.

247
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:22,599
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike needs to understand, as a game, the people who are behind all this, the niche it falls into because it can't compete with PUBG.

248
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,600
Speaker 1: PUBG and RMA and all these things are focused on real-world realism.

249
00:14:28,144 --> 00:14:29,140
Speaker 1: That space exists.

250
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,077
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike is not that.

251
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,259
Speaker 1: Don't try to compete with that.

252
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,280
Speaker 0: Well, they definitely didn't try to compete with that.

253
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:40,099
Speaker 1: It also can't be the silly Fortnite because that stuff, that's its own world of building a house in the middle of a match.

254
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,780
Speaker 1: But the beauty of Counter-Strike is the same beauty that Action Quake 2 had.

255
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,860
Speaker 1: You start with a bunch of guns, just fucking go.

256
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:57,740
Speaker 1: The way I always describe Counter-Strike to people, the original game, was the game begins the moment negotiations with the terrorists broke down.

257
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,520
Speaker 1: Like, that second.

258
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:00,460
Speaker 1: And that is the beauty.

259
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,875
Speaker 1: This has to be the 100-man enter, one-man leaves, that's just.

260
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:06,739
Speaker 1: everyone has a P90 and a giant map.

261
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:07,580
Speaker 1: Yeah.

262
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:09,620
Speaker 1: I would play the shit out of that.

263
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,179
Speaker 0: It was FYI's world, we played it all the time, but it didn't have 100 people left, and you kept respawning.

264
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,560
Speaker 1: We'd still put like 30 people in that tiny map because it was hilarious.

265
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:26,460
Speaker 0: You should choose a full infinite money Counter-Strike equipment loadout, and actually, it would be cool because it would be sort of the opposite of what PUBG is.

266
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,819
Speaker 0: When you play a PUBG, as you go on, if you survive, you kill someone, you get more and more stuff.

267
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,279
Speaker 0: You build up over time.

268
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:40,298
Speaker 0: Counter-Strike could be very successful doing the opposite, where everyone starts with a full loadout.

269
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:41,820
Speaker 0: But they're starting to run out of ammo.

270
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Speaker 0: But it's like, okay, I'm surviving and killing these other people with my fully loaded AUG, full armor, full grenades, full night vision, full everything.

271
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,560
Speaker 0: And then as the match goes on, well, I've killed 10 people, I have no AUG ammo left.

272
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,699
Speaker 0: I'm using my pistol.

273
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,200
Speaker 1: Yep.

274
00:15:57,341 --> 00:15:58,160
Speaker 1: Armor's worn down.

275
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,038
Speaker 1: Oh, I killed this guy.

276
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,600
Speaker 0: Someone else conserved their ammo and maybe still has an MP4 or whatever, right?

277
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:03,959
Speaker 0: Okay, my pistol's out.

278
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,719
Speaker 0: Now it's knife fight with the last guy.

279
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:06,300
Speaker 0: Yep.

280
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,719
Speaker 0: Not because it's, you know, what was the mode where you had to knife fight the last guy.

281
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,860
Speaker 1: Oh, gun game.

282
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:13,100
Speaker 0: It's not knife fight at the end because it's gun game.

283
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,380
Speaker 0: It's knife fight at the end because anyone who lasts that long against 100 opponents only has a knife left.

284
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,759
Speaker 1: It ends up being, you get that situation of, I've got an AUG and three bullets for it, or I could pick up this shotgun that has eight shells in it.

285
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,504
Speaker 0: Hmm.

286
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:29,420
Speaker 0: Well, I wouldn't let you pick up other people's stuff.

287
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,418
Speaker 0: I would make it so that your stuff goes down over time no matter what, because all you start with is all you can get at the end.

288
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:37,600
Speaker 0: Anyway.

289
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,080
Speaker 1: The point is, this game is not fun.

290
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:43,640
Speaker 0: It might one day be fun, but who will be playing it then if they keep working on it?

291
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:57,539
Speaker 1: But I don't think, the problem is they added all this crap and I feel like the first step is to remove all the crap they added, but I feel like that is, most people who are like product managers or game designers, removing all the crap you just added is the one thing that is impossible for them to do.

292
00:16:58,262 --> 00:17:06,156
Speaker 1: If you're out there, if you're listening to GeekKnives and you have that one single tier being shed, because we're craping all of your game, just remove all the crap and you will win.

293
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:13,380
Speaker 0: Just make exactly what I said, Counter Strike, exactly the same as Counter Strike, giant map, hundred people.

294
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,596
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically a gun game on that giant map.

295
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:27,980
Speaker 0: Before the game starts, you buy as much stuff as you want, you get dropped fucking somewhere, might be with a lot of people, might be an empty zone, doesn't matter, and you never get more stuff.

296
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,120
Speaker 0: You only use the stuff you started with and the last person alive wins the whole game.

297
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:42,956
Speaker 1: I would let people pick things out, but here's the rule, I would do it the way old Counter Strike did, where players drop whatever weapon was their current primary equipped weapon and nothing else.

298
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,720
Speaker 0: Because then you wouldn't run out of ammo, you wouldn't have that knife fight with the last guy that way.

299
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,396
Speaker 0: You would find someone who was murdered early and pick up their almost full machine gun.

300
00:17:54,022 --> 00:18:00,604
Speaker 1: To make it interesting, if they drop a weapon, it has at most one clip's worth of ammo in it.

301
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,919
Speaker 1: Then you could swap weapons, but it's always still the zero sum game.

302
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:10,415
Speaker 0: It's real simple and real pure to just be like, you got what you started with, you play to the end.

303
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,018
Speaker 0: You don't gotta mess around with weird stuff.

304
00:18:13,722 --> 00:18:15,840
Speaker 1: Don't even bother with it, it's just not fun.

305
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,819
Speaker 1: However, the other news is that as part of this, they released Counter Strike Go just free to play.

306
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:23,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I paid for Counter Strike way back in the day.

307
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:24,339
Speaker 0: It's really weird, right?

308
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:28,560
Speaker 0: Way back in the day, I had Half-Life 1, which I didn't pay for.

309
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:31,459
Speaker 0: I got the CD from a kid in high school and I used his key.

310
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:36,720
Speaker 0: And then he was using the key too, but it didn't matter in those days.

311
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:39,915
Speaker 0: It was the CD-ROM for Windows 95 or whatever, 98 SE.

312
00:18:42,401 --> 00:19:05,731
Speaker 0: And then when Steam came out, at the time I had this Half-Life 1 installation, which is legal but using someone else's key, and with the Counter Strike mod attached to it for free, and the day Steam came out, it sort of inherited my Half-Life and turned it into a legal copy of Half-Life with a legal copy of Counter Strike that I didn't have to pay for because I had pirated Half-Life 1 and Counter

313
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:06,233
Speaker 1: Strike was free.

314
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:15,637
Speaker 0: So I sort of grandfathered into a legal Half-Life license and a legal license for Day of Defeat and all the other Half-Life things.

315
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:16,644
Speaker 0: Which they were.

316
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:22,210
Speaker 0: then, when the Steam store opened, they were charging money for all these things that I had grandfathered into getting for free.

317
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:28,980
Speaker 0: and I just kept getting grandfathered into every Counter Strike and every Half-Life thing for free the whole time.

318
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,213
Speaker 0: I never paid for Counter Strike Go.

319
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:30,780
Speaker 0: that I remember.

320
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:32,420
Speaker 0: I don't think I did.

321
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:32,958
Speaker 0: Maybe I did?

322
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:33,818
Speaker 0: I don't think I did.

323
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:34,980
Speaker 1: I paid for Counter Strike Go.

324
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:35,477
Speaker 1: I bought it.

325
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,119
Speaker 0: Did I have to?

326
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:37,339
Speaker 0: Maybe I had to.

327
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,280
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

328
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,840
Speaker 0: But it feels like I've just always had every Counter Strike.

329
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:42,080
Speaker 0: I didn't pay for Counter Strike Source.

330
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:43,279
Speaker 0: That was definitely free.

331
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:49,695
Speaker 0: Oh no, I paid for Half-Life 2 and Counter Strike Source because I bought the red box, the orange box.

332
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:51,300
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, the orange box.

333
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:52,080
Speaker 0: The orange box.

334
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:52,980
Speaker 0: Anyway.

335
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,297
Speaker 0: But I'm pretty sure I didn't pay for a lot of...

336
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,840
Speaker 1: But if you've never played regular old Counter Strike, go play Counter Strike Go just to.

337
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,958
Speaker 0: Counter Strike Go is now free.

338
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,200
Speaker 0: Load it up for free and play regular mode.

339
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:05,660
Speaker 1: Or demolition mode.

340
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,800
Speaker 0: That's regular mode.

341
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,240
Speaker 1: No, demolition mode is not bomb defusal demolition.

342
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,960
Speaker 1: They have that mode that's like smaller maps and shorter objectives.

343
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,759
Speaker 0: Oh, that one.

344
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, where there's only one bomb site.

345
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:17,499
Speaker 1: Like that kind of stuff.

346
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:17,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's fun.

347
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,920
Speaker 1: That mode is actually real fun.

348
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's just small Counter Strike.

349
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,700
Speaker 1: Yep, it's small, quick Counter Strike.

350
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:24,676
Speaker 1: So in some other news...

351
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,320
Speaker 0: Right, so we're going to talk about Smash today.

352
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,500
Speaker 0: I just wanted to quickly mention, or geek bite, this thing that I bought.

353
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:34,240
Speaker 0: It's the 8BitDo GBRO wireless adapter.

354
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,716
Speaker 0: So what this is, it's a little purple guy, right?

355
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:38,780
Speaker 1: And it's got... I like how it's purple.

356
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:42,160
Speaker 0: It's a little purple guy that looks sort of like the style of a GameCube controller.

357
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,417
Speaker 0: It's got four buttons on it.

358
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:48,400
Speaker 0: And on one side is sort of that connector that was on the bottom of a Wiimote.

359
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,000
Speaker 0: You know that weird connector?

360
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

361
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:57,140
Speaker 0: Because Nintendo was actually using that connector for all those classic tiny consoles, like the NES Classic and the SNES Classic.

362
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:01,299
Speaker 0: Those all have that same bottom of Wiimote controller connector on bottom of them.

363
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:03,420
Speaker 0: For like their SNES and NES controllers.

364
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,300
Speaker 0: So it looks like a sort of USB.

365
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what that thing on the bottom of Wiimote was.

366
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,100
Speaker 0: But we'll call it bottom of Wiimote connector.

367
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,180
Speaker 0: And on the other side of it, it has GameCube controller connector.

368
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:25,400
Speaker 0: And what you do with this thing is you get it, you put in two AA batteries, you clap it closed, you push a button to turn it on, you hold down another button and it connects to your Switch and your Switch thinks it's a Switch controller.

369
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:37,060
Speaker 0: And then you plug in either, say, you know, one of your controllers from your NES or SNES Classic or your classic controller that you plugged into the bottom of your Wiimote, right?

370
00:21:37,684 --> 00:21:40,039
Speaker 0: Or, you know, a GameCube controller into the other side.

371
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:49,360
Speaker 0: And now those controllers are connecting wirelessly to your Switch so you can play Smash Brothers with your real GameCube controller on your Switch wirelessly.

372
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:57,280
Speaker 0: If you're a super pro there, I haven't measured it, obviously, but a lot of people online are measuring the lag of different controller options.

373
00:21:57,861 --> 00:22:04,640
Speaker 0: There's a lot of YouTube videos and other articles measuring the lag of different controller options for controllers for Smash Brothers and the Switch.

374
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Speaker 0: But if you don't care about lag because you're nowhere near a pro and you suck anyway, you just want to use a GameCube controller because it's comfy and sit on your couch far away from the TV without a wire, at least you have a wire, but it doesn't go very far, right?

375
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,778
Speaker 0: It doesn't have to go all the way to your Switch near your TV.

376
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:23,219
Speaker 0: The 8BitDo is not a bad purchase at all.

377
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:25,398
Speaker 0: It totally worked right out of the box.

378
00:22:26,821 --> 00:22:33,199
Speaker 0: And you can also even use it with your PC if you really want to, because you can connect your GameCube controller to play Steam games.

379
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:44,220
Speaker 0: Oh, actually, I could just for that more so than using it with a little gray switch on the top that goes between S for Switch and X for I think it just like Bluetooth.

380
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,339
Speaker 0: I'm not sure I haven't tried it, but you can connect to a PC with it.

381
00:22:47,721 --> 00:22:50,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see a whole bunch of options like the spec she talks about.

382
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:54,080
Speaker 0: I guess it has a little USB, a micro USB connector.

383
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,979
Speaker 0: So I think you can actually plug it into the PC with the micro USB.

384
00:22:57,949 --> 00:22:58,519
Speaker 0: I haven't tried that.

385
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:07,569
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day we got for me.

386
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:13,736
Speaker 0: So I don't know the whole story here, but I saw this posted and I got enough info to make it a thing of the day.

387
00:23:13,756 --> 00:23:15,470
Speaker 0: It seems that is in Russia.

388
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:16,769
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's in Russia.

389
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,047
Speaker 1: A group of people in a lot of stock in Russia.

390
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:24,750
Speaker 0: There was a bridge and the bridge was cars only, no pedestrians.

391
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:27,510
Speaker 0: And these people wanted to get across the other side.

392
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,430
Speaker 0: Maybe they were protesting the fact that there was no pedestrian path.

393
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,710
Speaker 0: Maybe they just really needed to get across teenagers.

394
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,770
Speaker 0: And that's what you do is having a fun time.

395
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:41,773
Speaker 0: Anyway, they just put in a costume and dressed up as a vehicle to go over the vehicle only bridge.

396
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:49,490
Speaker 0: And they had one of their friends wear like a safety vest with some lights to keep them from getting run over, walk behind her in front of them or whatever.

397
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:51,456
Speaker 0: And that's awesome.

398
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:53,610
Speaker 0: That's an awesome way of protesting.

399
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,477
Speaker 0: I wish we could have.

400
00:23:54,497 --> 00:23:55,650
Speaker 0: I don't know if they are protesting.

401
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:01,929
Speaker 1: It's not clear because I've seen some other people speculate that the person in the vest actually is a cop who was like, oh, no, no, no, no.

402
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:03,950
Speaker 1: And was walking him back the other way.

403
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,678
Speaker 0: That's possible.

404
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:05,529
Speaker 0: It's not clear.

405
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,634
Speaker 0: That's also possible.

406
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:16,911
Speaker 0: But regardless, we could do even if they're not protesting and just being silly, I want to do this kind of protest to protest, say, cars, cars, parked in the bike lane,

407
00:24:17,774 --> 00:24:19,459
Speaker 1: just crash into cars, parked

408
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,249
Speaker 0: up as a car and park in a bike lane, dress up as a bike park in a car lane.

409
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:25,989
Speaker 0: I don't know, something like that.

410
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,770
Speaker 1: So many of you might have seen the Super Mario Brothers movie.

411
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,475
Speaker 1: I saw it.

412
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:31,848
Speaker 0: So quick story.

413
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,410
Speaker 1: I saw it on opening night in the theater.

414
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:40,590
Speaker 0: It was my friend's birthday party and we were in the summer and we were going to go see the Super Mario Brothers movie, which I believe was a summer blockbuster.

415
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:47,070
Speaker 0: And we went to the movie theater and we were sitting in the movie theater and the movie theater failed to play the movie.

416
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:52,150
Speaker 0: Why do you do some sort of technical problem in the projection room to really dodge the bullet bill there?

417
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:58,189
Speaker 0: And I was very disappointed as a child who loved the Mario and watched the Super Mario Brothers Super Show and played it.

418
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:58,672
Speaker 0: Yes.

419
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:03,772
Speaker 0: And then we just taken one step and then again, went to the park and played softball instead.

420
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:11,715
Speaker 0: And I think it was like someone told I think I was talking about it recently with the person whose birthday party it was and they were like, yeah, it was like a million degrees out.

421
00:25:12,017 --> 00:25:13,650
Speaker 0: That's why he wanted to go to the air conditioned movie theater.

422
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:18,150
Speaker 0: But anyway, that's I didn't see it until much later.

423
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,909
Speaker 0: And I was disappointed again.

424
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:28,029
Speaker 1: So it's weird because the idea of it being like this weird, almost cyberpunk looking dystopia, like I feel like that could work.

425
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,008
Speaker 1: The movie was just badly made.

426
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:31,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a bad movie.

427
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,789
Speaker 1: Like it could have been good, even as weird as it was.

428
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:44,530
Speaker 1: But this is a 30 minute documentary that explains in pretty deep and fascinating detail with a lot of things I had no idea about why it was so bad.

429
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:50,310
Speaker 0: Gigg Knights is very guilty of doing 30 minute reviews of 20 minute episodes of shows where you just watch the show.

430
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,449
Speaker 0: You don't need to listen to our, you know, talking us.

431
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,269
Speaker 0: We talk longer about the thing than the thing is.

432
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,930
Speaker 0: I feel like you spent 30 minutes listening to talking about a 90 minute movie.

433
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,870
Speaker 0: You could just watch the 90 minute movie, but you watch the movie.

434
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,449
Speaker 1: You'll be like, wow, that was bad as it is.

435
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,400
Speaker 1: It didn't make sense, except for the Bob-omb and Big Bertha, which were literally the only good parts of the movie.

436
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,430
Speaker 0: Bob-omb was the good part.

437
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Bob-omb and Big Bertha were good.

438
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,079
Speaker 0: I don't remember Big Bertha.

439
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:11,889
Speaker 0: I just remember the Bob-omb.

440
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,770
Speaker 1: Big Bertha has a kiss with Mario.

441
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:15,050
Speaker 0: I remember the Bob-omb though.

442
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:15,989
Speaker 0: Love me some Bob-ombs.

443
00:26:17,412 --> 00:26:23,135
Speaker 1: But it is shocking how like how fucked up the production schedule of this movie was and why it was the way it was.

444
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:29,169
Speaker 1: And I think Dennis Hopper kept saying that to this day, this is the only thing in his entire life he regrets is being in this fucking movie.

445
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:29,753
Speaker 0: Well, I wouldn't.

446
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:31,789
Speaker 0: Of course, you'd be having anything to do with this movie.

447
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,090
Speaker 0: Everyone in the whole list of credits regrets having this movie.

448
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:42,570
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Dice Book Club book is still a Space Odyssey 2001.

449
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:42,731
Speaker 0: Yes.

450
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:46,330
Speaker 0: So I don't have to work between next basically at the end of this week.

451
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:52,390
Speaker 0: I'm done until I have to work one day before Magfest, like January 2nd after work.

452
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,990
Speaker 1: I got to work basically every day.

453
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:57,330
Speaker 0: I don't have to work again until the Monday after Magfest.

454
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,814
Speaker 0: So that's going to.

455
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:01,810
Speaker 0: I'm basically guaranteed to read this book in that zone.

456
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:05,790
Speaker 0: I actually promised that I'll read that book in that time frame.

457
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:06,220
Speaker 0: All right.

458
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,527
Speaker 1: I will.

459
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:11,500
Speaker 0: Because actually, I looked I think we've done less book clubs in twenty eighteen than previous years.

460
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,288
Speaker 1: It's been a busy year.

461
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:12,852
Speaker 0: Yeah.

462
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:15,130
Speaker 0: So well, hopefully twenty nineteen.

463
00:27:15,491 --> 00:27:18,290
Speaker 0: My goal is to do at least one more book club than twenty eighteen.

464
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,790
Speaker 1: Part of it's my commute so short now that I can't really read on the way to work anymore.

465
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:22,496
Speaker 0: Hmm.

466
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,029
Speaker 1: So, yeah, we'll be doing that.

467
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,490
Speaker 1: Also, we will be at multiple upcoming conventions.

468
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:31,027
Speaker 1: So if you want to see us again live at Magfest, we will be doing.

469
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:36,230
Speaker 1: I don't even know we're doing the 40 games you must play, not just tabletop.

470
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:36,736
Speaker 1: Great.

471
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:37,810
Speaker 1: I came up with a good rule.

472
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,450
Speaker 1: The rule will be in this panel for the games we list.

473
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:47,030
Speaker 1: The main rule is they have to be relatively easily playable today by an average.

474
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,149
Speaker 0: Most of our games are at a pretty hard to get.

475
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:50,214
Speaker 0: Yeah.

476
00:27:50,274 --> 00:27:50,939
Speaker 0: Yeah.

477
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:52,310
Speaker 1: Rare game mechanics.

478
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:53,514
Speaker 1: OK.

479
00:27:53,534 --> 00:27:56,410
Speaker 1: And read the rules as a panel with some really smart people.

480
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:56,950
Speaker 0: OK.

481
00:27:57,271 --> 00:28:05,396
Speaker 1: And then at PAX South, we will be doing nostalgia versus game design and potentially another learn and play.

482
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,230
Speaker 1: We're going to bring the learn and play and play to win.

483
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:09,988
Speaker 1: The same thing we're doing is unplugged.

484
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,850
Speaker 1: We're going to try to bring it to another pack.

485
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,774
Speaker 1: So stay tuned on that.

486
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:15,368
Speaker 1: There's a good chance we'll do it at PAX South, but it's not.

487
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:16,608
Speaker 1: it's not set in stone yet.

488
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:19,470
Speaker 1: So I'm going to admit something about Smash Brothers.

489
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,236
Speaker 0: You suck at it.

490
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:21,408
Speaker 1: I'm actually I'm OK.

491
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,272
Speaker 1: Better than you.

492
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:25,630
Speaker 1: Maybe I think now because you didn't play the previous one, really.

493
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:26,174
Speaker 0: I did.

494
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:26,518
Speaker 0: I had it.

495
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,510
Speaker 0: I played every Smash Brothers.

496
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,429
Speaker 1: Did you ever play the previous one against humans?

497
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:30,761
Speaker 0: Yeah, a little bit.

498
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:31,289
Speaker 1: A little bit.

499
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:32,053
Speaker 1: A little bit.

500
00:28:32,073 --> 00:28:32,113
Speaker 0: OK.

501
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:35,310
Speaker 0: I was about as awful as I was with all the other previous ones.

502
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,867
Speaker 1: But I never really liked the Nintendo 64 and I never owned one.

503
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:45,229
Speaker 1: So I never played the N64 Smash Brothers until I got to RIT.

504
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:47,290
Speaker 0: Oh, I played it a whole bunch in high school.

505
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:51,450
Speaker 1: And all you people in the lounge were like, oh, smash, like you're going to smash.

506
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,929
Speaker 1: You were all talking about it like it was a thing.

507
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,469
Speaker 1: And I was like, what, that dumb Mario fighting game?

508
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:56,435
Speaker 1: All right.

509
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:57,988
Speaker 1: And then I played it with all of you.

510
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:00,110
Speaker 1: And my opinion was not changed.

511
00:29:00,191 --> 00:29:01,408
Speaker 1: And I did not enjoy it at all.

512
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,414
Speaker 0: The game was way good.

513
00:29:02,495 --> 00:29:04,850
Speaker 0: At least I only have good memories of playing it.

514
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,867
Speaker 0: I haven't played it in many years, but I only have good memories of playing N64 Smash.

515
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:15,970
Speaker 1: It was not until the GameCube Smash where I was 100 percent smash.

516
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,608
Speaker 0: GameCube Smash was excellent.

517
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,510
Speaker 0: And all those nerds think it's the best one.

518
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,610
Speaker 1: The GameCube Smash?

519
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:24,089
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's the best one because the new one will have to stand the test of time.

520
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:24,969
Speaker 0: That's the one the pros love, right?

521
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:30,490
Speaker 1: I think it's the best one if we exclude the potential for Ultimate to be the best one.

522
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,470
Speaker 1: Anyway, I think it is the best one because the N64 one was not that fun, in my opinion.

523
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,290
Speaker 0: Well, the Wii one, right, was like it seemed really not.

524
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:41,386
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, just from the perspective of a non-pro player, right?

525
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:46,730
Speaker 0: Like, it just didn't have the excitement of the GameCube one, right?

526
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,210
Speaker 0: Even though it had more stuff, I guess that was at Brawl.

527
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:55,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it might have been partly the problem was that we played... You played Smash, the original one, in like high school with friends.

528
00:29:56,291 --> 00:30:03,389
Speaker 1: And then we all played the GameCube one in college together in the same room with like passing the controllers around on a TV.

529
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,950
Speaker 0: But I just... My memory of the Brawl one on the Wii was that it was just sort of like slower.

530
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,970
Speaker 0: At least my, you know, this is my memory, which is not the greatest.

531
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,990
Speaker 1: Oh, you couldn't get your frame perfect inputs in anymore?

532
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:23,770
Speaker 0: No, but it's, you know, it felt, you know, it felt like more sluggish and less, you know, dynamic than the GameCube one.

533
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,015
Speaker 0: Yeah.

534
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:30,590
Speaker 0: And then the one that came after that, which was on the Wii U and the DS, I only played the DS one, I never played the Wii U one.

535
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought it would be good.

536
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:33,629
Speaker 0: It was supposedly the same game.

537
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:35,023
Speaker 1: And it was pretty good.

538
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:35,550
Speaker 1: Like, it was fun.

539
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,233
Speaker 1: Like, I played it.

540
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:44,910
Speaker 1: The problem was because it couldn't be played on a shared console, it was very hard to get games of it going because online play on a Nintendo thing is just garbage out the door.

541
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though I owned every, I owned every Smash except for the N64 one, because I always played on someone else's N64.

542
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:56,390
Speaker 0: But the DS one, which I still have the cartridge right next to my DS, I played it the least.

543
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,450
Speaker 0: Like, I didn't even, I don't even know if I unlocked all the characters.

544
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:03,350
Speaker 1: Well, the main reason was that the only time I could really get that going would be at a party or at a convention.

545
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:08,630
Speaker 1: In both of those contexts, the local wireless just didn't fucking work, ever.

546
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,125
Speaker 1: Games would crash more often than not.

547
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:11,890
Speaker 1: It was worthless.

548
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:18,430
Speaker 1: And then a PAX, like a PAX OSS, the second PAX OSS was the last time I tried to play that Smash.

549
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,529
Speaker 1: I literally could not finish even one game in the entirety of PAX.

550
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,590
Speaker 0: People, and we were all trying.

551
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,050
Speaker 0: And also no one was going to buy a freaking Wii U, right?

552
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:36,650
Speaker 0: It was really the Wii U's fault, you know, is that like, if the Wii U was a real thing, we would all had Wii U's and, you know, played it at parties and stuff, right?

553
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,870
Speaker 0: But, because we did play the Wii one at parties and such.

554
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:46,430
Speaker 1: And the other trouble was, while it was a legit good Smash game, I don't know anyone who has a Wii U. On the 3D app, Matt has one, I think.

555
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:51,250
Speaker 0: Maybe, but I mean, like, maybe there are people have Wii U's that I know, but I don't know that they have a Wii U.

556
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:55,249
Speaker 1: That's like, maybe people I know have an STD, but I don't know for sure.

557
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,750
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, Scott Johnson might have a Wii U, but I don't know.

558
00:31:58,254 --> 00:31:59,209
Speaker 1: And we don't want to find out.

559
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:00,449
Speaker 0: I don't know if he has one or not.

560
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:06,670
Speaker 1: But, the problem with the 3DS one was that there weren't enough pixels on that screen.

561
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,930
Speaker 0: No, not really.

562
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,210
Speaker 1: So the game, like, didn't really work the same way.

563
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,590
Speaker 0: Maybe we did a Geek Nights on it when it came out and I forget.

564
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,870
Speaker 1: We did, and I'm pretty sure, I remember what we said.

565
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,790
Speaker 0: I don't remember what we said at all, if we did it or not.

566
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,870
Speaker 0: I don't even know if we did the episode.

567
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,989
Speaker 0: But anyway, four years later, Smash Brothers Ultimate is out and we got it.

568
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,230
Speaker 0: It's on the Switch, which is a great improvement over the other previous options.

569
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,090
Speaker 1: Yup, so I've been playing it a bunch, I've been unlocking stuff.

570
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:33,390
Speaker 0: I've mostly been playing single player, because we haven't had parties at my house.

571
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,430
Speaker 1: But we're about to have New Year's, where we're going to play it a bunch.

572
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,730
Speaker 0: We're about to play a bunch of multiplayer in the near future.

573
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,629
Speaker 1: Magfest, we're going to play the shit out of it.

574
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:44,570
Speaker 1: Paxile, three events in a row, we're going to play the shit out of this game.

575
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:46,409
Speaker 0: Unless it sucks and we don't want to play it anymore.

576
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at least, so I can say this, because we're not going to review, like, all the content we don't care about in this game.

577
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:56,290
Speaker 1: Like, there's a lot of things you can unlock that I just don't care, I've never cared about that stuff.

578
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,048
Speaker 1: You can read some guide about it.

579
00:32:58,791 --> 00:32:59,906
Speaker 1: But in terms of the actual...

580
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:00,830
Speaker 0: I want to talk about that stuff.

581
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,589
Speaker 0: We'll talk about it a little bit.

582
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,510
Speaker 0: The spirit, whatever.

583
00:33:02,771 --> 00:33:04,430
Speaker 1: I just don't care about the spirit nonsense.

584
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,430
Speaker 1: But in terms of the actual core gameplay, it feels right.

585
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,810
Speaker 1: They're playing it to unlock, even though, as an adult, I don't want to have to unlock shit.

586
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:16,110
Speaker 1: I just want all the characters.

587
00:33:17,032 --> 00:33:17,720
Speaker 1: And I'm annoyed.

588
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,530
Speaker 1: I have to unlock them.

589
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:19,230
Speaker 0: I'm very annoyed.

590
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:24,770
Speaker 1: I remember at RIT, we would, like, pass around the one good memory card that had everything unlocked.

591
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,045
Speaker 1: Yup.

592
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:37,430
Speaker 1: And I remember, like, multiple parties that were ruined because we'd be at someone's apartment on campus, we're going to bust out the Smash, they don't have all the characters unlocked, and none of us brought the magic unlocker with us, and now we're stuck playing.

593
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:39,050
Speaker 0: My memory card had everything unlocked.

594
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,590
Speaker 0: Yup.

595
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:41,369
Speaker 1: And we passed your memory card around.

596
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:42,029
Speaker 0: Anyway.

597
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:49,459
Speaker 0: But yeah, so, in terms of the feel of the game, I'm not a pro, and I never will be, right?

598
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:55,830
Speaker 0: But in terms of, like, playing the Smash, you know, it's like everything feels like all the old Smashes, right?

599
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,230
Speaker 1: All the timing feels right, the moves are right.

600
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:06,150
Speaker 0: The only thing that feels wrong, and I'm not knowledgeable enough to know, you know, fighting game-wise, if this is different from previous Smashes.

601
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,009
Speaker 1: I'm really curious what you're about to say.

602
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:13,790
Speaker 0: Is that there's some sort of, like, input buffering going on, right?

603
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:17,889
Speaker 0: So for example, let's say I do a really slow attack.

604
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:20,248
Speaker 0: Like, I do a big ol' hammer swing, like, whoosh.

605
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:20,608
Speaker 0: Yup.

606
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:20,929
Speaker 0: Right?

607
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:27,489
Speaker 0: And so that'll probably be, like, I guess for Kirby's hammer swing, it's like special to the right.

608
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:28,367
Speaker 0: Right?

609
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,630
Speaker 0: I don't play Kirby.

610
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:30,190
Speaker 1: I don't care.

611
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:30,690
Speaker 0: Kirby's good.

612
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:31,630
Speaker 0: I don't like Kirby.

613
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,030
Speaker 0: Anyway.

614
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,049
Speaker 1: I'm all about the princess.

615
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:36,670
Speaker 0: You know, the guy who made Smash Brothers, Sakurai, got his start making Kirby games.

616
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:37,889
Speaker 0: He's the Kirby guy.

617
00:34:38,254 --> 00:34:38,989
Speaker 1: I don't like playing Kirby.

618
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,529
Speaker 0: Anyway.

619
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:45,630
Speaker 0: But let's say you do a really slow attack, and in the middle of that slow attack, let's say you just press A to do a regular attack, right?

620
00:34:46,391 --> 00:34:47,509
Speaker 0: And then you don't touch anything.

621
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:53,344
Speaker 0: When you're... As soon as that special attack's animation finishes, the A attack will just, like, come out.

622
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,070
Speaker 0: Like, it's been stored in the buffer, right?

623
00:34:56,571 --> 00:35:01,829
Speaker 0: So fighting game people, like, that's a natural thing to them, like, buffering up moves or combos and stuff like that, right?

624
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:04,450
Speaker 0: And it may... This may have been in the previous Smashes.

625
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:12,910
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's new in this one, but maybe just because I'm older, slower, more knowledgeable about this sort of thing from watching a bunch of speedrunners.

626
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:15,970
Speaker 1: Smash 4 Wii U input buffering in depth.

627
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:16,763
Speaker 0: Okay.

628
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:18,710
Speaker 0: So, anyway.

629
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,547
Speaker 1: I never attempted to buffer inputs because I wasn't...

630
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,130
Speaker 0: No, I've never attempted to buffer an input in my life.

631
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,669
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is that my natural thing to do when I'm playing a game like this...

632
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,510
Speaker 1: Supposedly it's only in Brawl and 4.

633
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:31,610
Speaker 0: Okay.

634
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,185
Speaker 0: Anyway.

635
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:34,987
Speaker 0: That wiki might not be updated for the new...

636
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the new one, I assume, also has it.

637
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:37,747
Speaker 0: The new one has it.

638
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,149
Speaker 0: But anyway.

639
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,430
Speaker 1: I assume it wasn't in the previous ones.

640
00:35:40,692 --> 00:35:41,050
Speaker 0: Right, anyway.

641
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,109
Speaker 1: At least not in this one.

642
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:56,930
Speaker 0: What happens is, just as someone who's playing naturally, sort of not button mashing, but also not a pro in my zone where I am, right, where I'm pushing buttons with intent, knowing what they do, but also sort of mashing them and not having any finesse or skill.

643
00:35:57,212 --> 00:35:57,390
Speaker 1: Ah, yes.

644
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:03,170
Speaker 1: Smash 64 and Smash Melee had no intuitive or usable buffering mechanics.

645
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:03,990
Speaker 0: Okay.

646
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,498
Speaker 0: So what I do...

647
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,390
Speaker 1: Any buffering you could pull off was basically like frame perfect bullshit.

648
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:08,730
Speaker 0: Right.

649
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:15,250
Speaker 0: So what I do as a natural, just my muscle memory, is, for example, I'll be doing a slow move, right?

650
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,565
Speaker 0: I'll swing a hammer real slow, and things are still happening while this animation is going on.

651
00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:23,950
Speaker 0: So let's say I do the slow move, and then someone's coming in from the top.

652
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:26,370
Speaker 0: So I'll start mashing like an up A, right?

653
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,029
Speaker 0: Because I want that up A to come out as soon as possible, right?

654
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:38,730
Speaker 0: But then I'm mashing that up A, but meanwhile, as I'm mashing it and the slow animation is still happening, maybe things change, and that person's now coming in behind me.

655
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,330
Speaker 0: So I switch to a left A instead of an up A, right?

656
00:36:42,695 --> 00:36:42,760
Speaker 0: Yep.

657
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,207
Speaker 0: Right?

658
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:51,590
Speaker 0: So it's like, in the olden days, what would happen with the no input buffering is, as soon as my animation finished, basically whatever I pushed next would happen.

659
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,370
Speaker 0: So even though I switched a left A, the left A is what happens, right?

660
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,250
Speaker 0: As soon as I managed to press it on a free frame.

661
00:36:57,273 --> 00:36:57,410
Speaker 1: Yep.

662
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:02,269
Speaker 1: I think the reason this bothers you is probably just that because you didn't play a lot of like those Smash Bros.

663
00:37:02,771 --> 00:37:10,210
Speaker 0: So with input buffering, what happens is, I was pushing the up A during my animation, I switched to the left A, but no, that up A is in the buffer.

664
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:17,629
Speaker 0: And once my big slow animation finishes, the up A comes out and it's like, no, I switched to the left A. Why is this up A in the buffer, right?

665
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:24,509
Speaker 0: I would really much rather have it eat all of my inputs unless I'm on a free frame and then accept inputs again.

666
00:37:24,891 --> 00:37:30,429
Speaker 0: Just because that's what feels natural to someone who's not a fighting game player and isn't thinking about input buffering.

667
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:30,745
Speaker 0: Yep.

668
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,970
Speaker 0: It's just naturally like whatever button I'm pressing is what I want to fucking happen, right?

669
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:41,042
Speaker 0: And if I push something and it didn't happen because I was busy doing something else, then I don't expect that thing to suddenly happen later.

670
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:42,844
Speaker 0: if I've switched to telling you something else.

671
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,429
Speaker 1: Well, all it means is you're going to get used to not committing to a buffered action in the middle of a long action.

672
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:59,349
Speaker 0: I have to wait for the animation to finish and then do a frame perfect input on the free frame, figuring out or buffer one input and wait for that move to happen and then buffer another input.

673
00:38:00,002 --> 00:38:00,170
Speaker 0: Right.

674
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,510
Speaker 0: It's just not natural to someone who's not a fighting game player.

675
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,890
Speaker 0: And I think that it's sort of like you got this Smash Brothers as a whole.

676
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,809
Speaker 0: The story of it is that it's two games.

677
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:16,110
Speaker 0: It's a game for these pro fighting game people, but it's different from all the other fighting games, but it's still a pro competitive game.

678
00:38:16,731 --> 00:38:21,310
Speaker 0: And it is also this wacky, crazy party game with a bunch of items and ridiculous nonsense.

679
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:32,629
Speaker 0: And it's somehow managed to be both at once really well better than any other game is two things at once, but also still has problems because it's trying to be two things at once.

680
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:39,850
Speaker 0: You know, the pro people have to have to use these features that they've added quite nicely, in fact, that allow them to limit.

681
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:45,349
Speaker 0: They've added all these profiles you can make to where it's like, OK, I could add like pro mode to the game.

682
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:50,889
Speaker 0: So you customize like, OK, don't use any of these maps, don't use any of these characters, don't use any of these items.

683
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,610
Speaker 1: Keep only like the items that are skill based.

684
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,337
Speaker 0: You save that configuration and then later on when you come back, you just like pro mode go.

685
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,670
Speaker 0: And it's already in promo.

686
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,000
Speaker 0: Right.

687
00:38:59,330 --> 00:38:59,590
Speaker 0: It's already.

688
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,768
Speaker 0: You can save those setups.

689
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:06,150
Speaker 0: So, you know, back in the day, we used to constantly like, oh, we forgot to switch it to stock five.

690
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:06,501
Speaker 1: Yeah.

691
00:39:06,852 --> 00:39:07,268
Speaker 0: None of that.

692
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,510
Speaker 0: You just save standard stock mode.

693
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:15,930
Speaker 1: And then when you go to play with your friends, you go stock mode go because frankly, in my personal taste, stock five is the only way to play.

694
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,708
Speaker 1: I don't care about.

695
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,390
Speaker 1: I don't like the frantic get kills mode.

696
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:19,949
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

697
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:21,789
Speaker 1: I'm not a pro and I never will be a pro.

698
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:27,910
Speaker 1: The point is pros play stock going back and forth along the top, avoiding Scott and let him do my dirty work anyway.

699
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,730
Speaker 0: So they've added pros have to eliminate all the fun stuff, right?

700
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:34,428
Speaker 0: Even though they've made it easier for them to do it.

701
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:39,790
Speaker 0: But normal people, the the actual mechanics of the game, right?

702
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:45,010
Speaker 0: Like the buffering and other things like that aren't really changed right for them.

703
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,430
Speaker 0: They can't like disable or make the game simpler or wackier control wise.

704
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:54,290
Speaker 0: So even when you're playing crazy party mode, the pro stuff doesn't go away.

705
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,269
Speaker 0: So if you play with a pro person, you're going to get ruined.

706
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,050
Speaker 0: Yeah.

707
00:39:57,231 --> 00:40:06,650
Speaker 0: And they've added this so many like really fine details in this game, like moving your shield and like if you roll too many times before.

708
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:06,895
Speaker 1: Yeah.

709
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:08,250
Speaker 0: But it's like it matters.

710
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:13,729
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you can if you roll more, if you like roll a whole bunch constantly, you start rolling slower.

711
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:14,874
Speaker 1: Well, they've always had that.

712
00:40:14,894 --> 00:40:22,554
Speaker 1: if you even in brawl or the melee, I'm pretty sure if you kept using one move of any kind, that move was gipped in some way if you kept doing it.

713
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:29,770
Speaker 0: But it's like there's so much subtle finesse stuff going on in Smash that has the super high skill cap.

714
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,850
Speaker 0: And that super high skill cap is always there.

715
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,970
Speaker 0: You can't turn it off.

716
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:41,990
Speaker 1: I kind of liked that, though, because for a casual player or even like I like if I was a competitive player, but as a casual player, you won't even know the game.

717
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,250
Speaker 1: Just sometimes something funny happens.

718
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,148
Speaker 1: You're not quite sure why.

719
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,590
Speaker 0: Yeah.

720
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:49,289
Speaker 0: But it's also sometimes frustrating to play as a casual player because it's like, oh, I thought I was hit.

721
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:50,669
Speaker 0: Why did I get hit there?

722
00:40:50,939 --> 00:40:51,170
Speaker 0: Right.

723
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:53,083
Speaker 0: And instead of me hitting you, I was trying to.

724
00:40:53,123 --> 00:40:53,989
Speaker 0: I was doing a move.

725
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,356
Speaker 1: Dude, the games a casual player will never ask the question, why did I get hit all the time?

726
00:40:58,691 --> 00:40:59,636
Speaker 1: Well, you asked that in.

727
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:02,090
Speaker 1: you asked that in turn based games.

728
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:02,686
Speaker 0: Yes.

729
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:12,050
Speaker 0: Yes, I do know, but it happens a lot where like I'm swinging my sword, someone else is swinging a sword, and then I'm the one who takes damage.

730
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:13,089
Speaker 0: It's like, why?

731
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:17,510
Speaker 0: The game, you know, I don't know, for a pro person, that would just be natural.

732
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:20,330
Speaker 0: But for a casual player, it sometimes can be frustrating.

733
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:20,687
Speaker 1: Yep.

734
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,370
Speaker 1: The only thing that annoys like the game's fun and it feels right.

735
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,490
Speaker 1: And like the smash mechanics feel good.

736
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,502
Speaker 1: I just don't like to have to unlock things.

737
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:31,030
Speaker 0: that I really don't like unlocking anything.

738
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:38,869
Speaker 1: I never like to have to unlock things that I wish there was a way to pay to just not have to unlock any of this crap at the page to just be all the characters just be there.

739
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,977
Speaker 1: The end like I never.

740
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:43,350
Speaker 0: I still don't have game and watch my second fave guy.

741
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:44,387
Speaker 0: I still don't have him.

742
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:48,549
Speaker 1: And I remember it's not like we've changed even at RIT.

743
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,410
Speaker 1: Like I said, we hated unlocking things.

744
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,210
Speaker 1: And we sort of like always played on one memory card to unlock everything as fast as possible.

745
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:58,609
Speaker 1: So everyone would have everything unlocked yet.

746
00:41:58,872 --> 00:42:00,530
Speaker 0: It's like that's something I could do when I was younger.

747
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,849
Speaker 0: I was talking to someone who was like, oh, yeah, I just unlocked it.

748
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,170
Speaker 0: And like, you know, an afternoon, you know, it's like he's like five or six hours.

749
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's five or six days for this guy I was talking to.

750
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,070
Speaker 0: He was like, yeah, it's not a 10 minute timer.

751
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:17,210
Speaker 0: So what you do is you wait 10 minutes and then you come back to the game and you unlock a character and then you go away again.

752
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,310
Speaker 0: And I'm like, first of all, I'm not that good.

753
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:22,629
Speaker 0: So when I even when I get a new challenger appearing, sometimes I lose.

754
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:23,790
Speaker 1: Well, that's just sad.

755
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:24,688
Speaker 1: I don't know what's wrong with you.

756
00:42:24,972 --> 00:42:26,128
Speaker 1: I've only lost once ever.

757
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:27,018
Speaker 0: That's it.

758
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:27,649
Speaker 0: I'm not very good.

759
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:31,783
Speaker 0: And to it's like, really, that's I don't have time for.

760
00:42:31,803 --> 00:42:33,750
Speaker 0: that should sit there at a 10 minute timer.

761
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:35,070
Speaker 0: Like, you know, it's like I'm an adult.

762
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,109
Speaker 0: I have shit to do.

763
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,490
Speaker 0: I'm not like some person.

764
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,097
Speaker 0: I have a job.

765
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:38,849
Speaker 0: I got to go work.

766
00:42:39,071 --> 00:42:44,130
Speaker 0: It's like I don't have time to sit there and baby this game console for 10 every 10 minutes for hours on end.

767
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:47,970
Speaker 1: Like in the GameCube smash, all those other modes, I never gave a shit.

768
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:49,415
Speaker 1: I never guess.

769
00:42:49,455 --> 00:42:52,730
Speaker 0: if you're someone with really no time, then you can go.

770
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,048
Speaker 0: That's not a problem for you.

771
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,210
Speaker 1: But but I never went into those modes.

772
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,309
Speaker 1: The only exception was I would do the sandbag sometimes because that was fun.

773
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:00,489
Speaker 0: The sandbags not in there.

774
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:01,709
Speaker 0: Where my sandbag at?

775
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:02,153
Speaker 1: Yeah.

776
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:03,950
Speaker 1: Why isn't he a character?

777
00:43:04,111 --> 00:43:04,858
Speaker 0: That's also true.

778
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:06,190
Speaker 0: Why isn't the sandbag a character?

779
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:06,821
Speaker 1: I'd play him.

780
00:43:06,842 --> 00:43:07,189
Speaker 1: Yeah.

781
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:13,150
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like, OK, even if, you know, you have the time to waste on that, it's like that's not fun.

782
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:14,750
Speaker 0: That's busy work, right?

783
00:43:15,211 --> 00:43:16,769
Speaker 0: It's like I just want to play the game.

784
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:18,970
Speaker 0: I don't and have the fun and do the fun part.

785
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,409
Speaker 0: I don't want to do this busy work in order to play the game.

786
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:25,129
Speaker 0: I don't want to grind up and level up my character in order to play the RPG.

787
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:31,050
Speaker 1: I just want to be sure there are people who really enjoy that cycle and enjoy that so-called story mode.

788
00:43:31,552 --> 00:43:33,129
Speaker 1: But I'm not that person.

789
00:43:33,453 --> 00:43:34,390
Speaker 1: I've never enjoyed.

790
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,849
Speaker 1: So story mode in any smash game ever.

791
00:43:37,111 --> 00:43:41,908
Speaker 0: Well, so there's the the spirit guide, the world ever spirit world mode.

792
00:43:42,671 --> 00:43:46,850
Speaker 0: The way it works is you walk around this map and there's different encounters on the map.

793
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:47,211
Speaker 0: Right.

794
00:43:47,653 --> 00:43:51,310
Speaker 0: So, for example, you'll encounter, you know, some some character.

795
00:43:51,691 --> 00:43:51,953
Speaker 0: Right.

796
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:54,610
Speaker 0: And it's a character that is not actually in Smash.

797
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:58,126
Speaker 0: So let me think of it like Skullman from Mega Man.

798
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,152
Speaker 0: Right.

799
00:43:59,192 --> 00:44:00,469
Speaker 0: So like Skullman from Mega Man.

800
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:05,770
Speaker 0: And but when you actually get in the fight, it's you're fighting against the Mega Man character because it's still Smash Brothers.

801
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,750
Speaker 0: And those didn't add Skullman to Mega Man.

802
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,250
Speaker 0: Right.

803
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:13,870
Speaker 0: But it's Mega Man and he's white and he behaves in a certain way that's reminiscent of Skullman.

804
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:14,552
Speaker 0: Right.

805
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:20,070
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like, you know, the closest and some of them are really kind of hilarious and clever.

806
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:20,852
Speaker 0: Right.

807
00:44:21,112 --> 00:44:26,289
Speaker 0: Like, you know, and even when you play the classic mode, it's like if you play as Dr.

808
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:33,150
Speaker 0: Mario in classic mode, all the battles you do, it's like, OK, fight for Yoshi's a red, green and three.

809
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,727
Speaker 0: You know, it's like the three colored Yoshi's to match the three colors of germs that Dr.

810
00:44:36,747 --> 00:44:37,370
Speaker 0: Mario fought.

811
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:47,570
Speaker 0: And it's like you're doing all these encounters that are custom smash battles to match these characters that are sort of being represented.

812
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:49,314
Speaker 0: Right.

813
00:44:49,678 --> 00:44:51,010
Speaker 0: You know, that aren't in Smash Brothers.

814
00:44:51,232 --> 00:44:53,010
Speaker 0: And it's it's really kind of cute and fun.

815
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,790
Speaker 0: All the different battles are like little fun puzzles to solve.

816
00:44:56,211 --> 00:45:03,950
Speaker 0: The problem with it is that many of these battles in the spirit world mode thing are basically ridiculously OP and you can't beat them.

817
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:07,290
Speaker 0: It's like you go in and you die in one hit and like, what the fuck was that nonsense?

818
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:18,250
Speaker 0: It's because there's actually this grindy RPG where you get spirits and spirit like essences things and you combine them and level them up to increase your energy or whatever.

819
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:22,309
Speaker 0: And you get snacks, you can feed them snacks, feed them snacks to give them more points.

820
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,110
Speaker 0: And there's a rock paper scissors going on.

821
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:32,610
Speaker 0: So you actually need a red spirit, a green spirit and a blue spirit, because like if you fight a green one, you need to have a red one.

822
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,130
Speaker 1: I think I'm fine with all of this.

823
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,894
Speaker 1: You need to level up.

824
00:45:35,974 --> 00:45:38,470
Speaker 0: Otherwise, if you go into that battle, they kill you in one hit.

825
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:42,170
Speaker 0: And if you level up, it's like, ah, now we actually have a normal percentages.

826
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:43,550
Speaker 0: I don't die in one anymore.

827
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,032
Speaker 1: See, that's it.

828
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:47,510
Speaker 1: The only thing I don't like about the mode is I don't want to have to grind and level stuff up.

829
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:49,550
Speaker 0: No, I'd like to treat them like puzzles.

830
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,790
Speaker 0: It would be great to just have all these cute encounters that where it's like, you know, look, it's a Pac-Man encounter.

831
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:55,175
Speaker 0: Get it.

832
00:45:55,256 --> 00:45:55,843
Speaker 0: I get it.

833
00:45:55,904 --> 00:45:56,410
Speaker 0: It's hilarious.

834
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,016
Speaker 0: It's great.

835
00:45:57,077 --> 00:45:57,950
Speaker 0: Very creative of you.

836
00:45:58,132 --> 00:45:58,724
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

837
00:45:58,765 --> 00:45:58,990
Speaker 0: Right.

838
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:06,570
Speaker 1: You know, I think the way I might handle this is I'll probably ignore the mode for a long time and eventually I'll acquire so many snacks.

839
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,589
Speaker 0: So what I'm doing, well, no, you acquire the snacks by using playing the mode.

840
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:13,930
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I was getting them from story mode when I'm unlocking characters.

841
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:14,713
Speaker 0: You get some in there.

842
00:46:14,753 --> 00:46:19,110
Speaker 0: But also, if you go in, play the game in the mode, you get to like the cave.

843
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:21,728
Speaker 0: And you can put your spirits in the cave and they just level up in there.

844
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,270
Speaker 0: You know, it's like it's, you know, but I'm doing it because it's fun.

845
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:30,850
Speaker 0: And also because what I do is I play it and then when I stop playing it, it says a new challenger appeared.

846
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:36,970
Speaker 0: So it's like I can play the spirit mode and I'm just playing it normally, you know, and then when I stop playing it.

847
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:38,830
Speaker 0: Oh, look, a character has been unlocked.

848
00:46:39,311 --> 00:46:39,533
Speaker 0: Right.

849
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:41,930
Speaker 0: It's sort of a convenient, convenient deal.

850
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,430
Speaker 1: I guess pretty much, though, all I'm going to go for is unlocking all of the main characters.

851
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:49,090
Speaker 1: That is all I actually want.

852
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,128
Speaker 0: Once you've unlocked all the because all the maps are unlocked to begin with.

853
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:56,470
Speaker 0: So once you've unlocked all the characters, you are now in multiplayer heaven, party mode heaven.

854
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:00,850
Speaker 1: You have everybody up and then there'll be DLC, probably like more characters and more maps.

855
00:47:01,272 --> 00:47:03,065
Speaker 0: They are charging some for some DLCs.

856
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:13,390
Speaker 0: But Nintendo has seemed to settled on this sort of model of DLC, but not evil DLC, at least not super evil DLC.

857
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,210
Speaker 0: We're basically it's an expansion.

858
00:47:15,411 --> 00:47:15,733
Speaker 0: Yeah.

859
00:47:15,974 --> 00:47:18,389
Speaker 0: So like Zelda, Breath of the Wild did the same thing.

860
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,790
Speaker 0: We're like you pay one fee, you're basically instead of you could pay fifty dollars for this game.

861
00:47:23,192 --> 00:47:25,890
Speaker 0: But if you pay seventy five dollars for this game, we'll give you a lot more game.

862
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:26,553
Speaker 0: Right.

863
00:47:26,876 --> 00:47:28,510
Speaker 0: There isn't any DLC like after that.

864
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:32,590
Speaker 0: So like with Smash, you buy it for fifty, sixty bucks, whatever they charge for it.

865
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:43,390
Speaker 0: And then after you put it in your switch, it's like, OK, if you give us like twenty five more dollars, we're going to give you like all these expansion content for the next year plus.

866
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:44,054
Speaker 0: Right.

867
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:46,349
Speaker 0: You're going to get all these extra characters and all this extra stuff.

868
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:51,910
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, OK, yeah, I'm not too broken up about that.

869
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,614
Speaker 1: Like, that's fine.

870
00:47:52,634 --> 00:47:53,117
Speaker 0: It's not like.

871
00:47:53,178 --> 00:47:55,029
Speaker 0: it's not like they're not selling you pay to win.

872
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,510
Speaker 0: They're not selling you micro loot boxes with random stuff.

873
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:02,470
Speaker 1: It's not like that unconfirmed news about Fallout 76. that if true means we'll never play.

874
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,370
Speaker 0: It's not any different than buying an expansion for a board game, basically.

875
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:06,172
Speaker 0: Right.

876
00:48:06,493 --> 00:48:06,754
Speaker 0: Yeah.

877
00:48:06,914 --> 00:48:11,390
Speaker 0: It's like you pay some extra money to get more stuff or don't whatever.

878
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:17,490
Speaker 1: But I think just based on my play, of course, smash mechanics, the only part I actually care about.

879
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,630
Speaker 1: It's a perfectly fine smash.

880
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,034
Speaker 1: It is now the new smash.

881
00:48:21,396 --> 00:48:25,350
Speaker 1: for anyone who isn't like Counter-Strike one six and GameCube smash.

882
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:27,385
Speaker 0: I don't know how pro people feel about it.

883
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:27,949
Speaker 0: I don't care.

884
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:35,550
Speaker 0: There is a guy who claims to be the best player of the previous smash, the DS Wii U one three years.

885
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,047
Speaker 0: And he has YouTube channel.

886
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,950
Speaker 0: I'll send Remo Link to if I can find it.

887
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:40,587
Speaker 1: I should watch that.

888
00:48:41,071 --> 00:48:46,650
Speaker 0: And he talks about the new smash and like the technical details of it in a way that I can understand.

889
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,069
Speaker 0: And it's very informative and good.

890
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:50,310
Speaker 0: And his videos are good.

891
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,009
Speaker 0: I don't know if he's actually the best of the previous smash, but I won't doubt him.

892
00:48:54,172 --> 00:48:55,789
Speaker 0: I'm just you know, I can't confirm it.

893
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:57,024
Speaker 1: I'm the best of the previous.

894
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:57,186
Speaker 1: Sure.

895
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,989
Speaker 0: But the problem is, is I cannot execute anything.

896
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,950
Speaker 0: He has taught me anything.

897
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:07,150
Speaker 0: He's taught me I couldn't actually do when I was playing the game, even though I understood what he was saying.

898
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:09,849
Speaker 1: But I think this is going to get a lot of play.

899
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:21,030
Speaker 1: I guess what's going to be really good for us old timers is that we literally have three or four major gaming conventions and events where this will get played pretty much right after it came out.

900
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:25,290
Speaker 0: So it has so many characters and maps and items and all that stuff.

901
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:36,870
Speaker 0: I think the replay value really isn't going to run out right with the N64 one that, you know, actually the N64 is really the only one that didn't have enough content where you could play it out.

902
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,269
Speaker 0: Like I've played every character and every map against it.

903
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:41,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, the GameCube one never really got played out for me.

904
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,513
Speaker 1: I would play it right now.

905
00:49:42,533 --> 00:49:48,850
Speaker 0: Starting at the GameCube one, there was always enough characters and enough maps that you wouldn't get bored and then it only got bigger.

906
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:50,010
Speaker 0: So now it's so big.

907
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,370
Speaker 0: I can't imagine ever needing more.

908
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:57,450
Speaker 0: Like, I don't feel like I'm going to buy the next smash whenever it comes, if it ever comes, because like, what do I need it for?

909
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,615
Speaker 0: I have this smash.

910
00:49:59,138 --> 00:50:01,149
Speaker 0: I'm not playing it on the Internet or competitively.

911
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:02,294
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the thing.

912
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:04,670
Speaker 1: The biggest things we can't answer yet are one.

913
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,830
Speaker 0: You know, they say penultimate and then ultimate.

914
00:50:06,972 --> 00:50:08,070
Speaker 0: It's not penultimate smash.

915
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:08,990
Speaker 0: It's smash ultimate.

916
00:50:09,153 --> 00:50:09,929
Speaker 0: That means final.

917
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,330
Speaker 0: I don't need another smash.

918
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,570
Speaker 1: So the open questions, the things we cannot review.

919
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,610
Speaker 1: One, will the online multiplayer work at all?

920
00:50:16,831 --> 00:50:17,549
Speaker 0: I will never know.

921
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,470
Speaker 0: I will never pay for Nintendo online.

922
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,470
Speaker 0: Also, everyone says that it's really bad.

923
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,347
Speaker 0: I believe them.

924
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,910
Speaker 0: And number two, much more important.

925
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,770
Speaker 0: I was smart not to pay for Nintendo online and never will.

926
00:50:25,911 --> 00:50:26,468
Speaker 0: You shouldn't either.

927
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:30,310
Speaker 1: Will local wireless play work at all?

928
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,889
Speaker 1: I won't know until I try.

929
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:37,610
Speaker 1: Nintendo's batting zero on local multiplayer for some time now, and I'm really worried it won't work.

930
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:42,729
Speaker 0: Even on GBAs where it worked with the cables, the cables would come loose and you couldn't reconnect them.

931
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:45,850
Speaker 1: Rooting like a three hour game of Advance Wars.

932
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:46,367
Speaker 0: Yep.

933
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,009
Speaker 1: There's no way to recover from that.

934
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:48,360
Speaker 0: Yep.

935
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,330
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I'm going to be smashing.

936
00:50:51,194 --> 00:50:52,189
Speaker 1: You should be smashing, too.

937
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:53,489
Speaker 1: Let's smash.

938
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,700
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

950
00:52:24,802 --> 00:52:26,020
Speaker 1: I'm trying to make some more Civ videos.

951
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:32,038
Speaker 1: I've almost edited together the Puerto Rico Learn and Win panel, so I'll try to get that up soon.

952
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,419
Speaker 1: But yeah, I'm tired and I'm going to go to bed soon.

953
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,289
Speaker 1: So now I leave you with... Ziz, a nice stick.

954
00:52:42,253 --> 00:52:43,860
Speaker 1: I like...sticks.

955
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:45,818
Speaker 1: Peck, pick.

956
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:47,609
Speaker 0: Let me smash.

957
00:52:48,396 --> 00:52:48,760
Speaker 0: Please.

958
00:52:49,941 --> 00:52:51,980
Speaker 1: No Ron, go find Becky.

959
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,800
Speaker 0: You want some fuck?

960
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:56,060
Speaker 1: No Ron, I don't want some fuck.

961
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:56,864
Speaker 0: I got you blue.

962
00:52:57,287 --> 00:52:59,600
Speaker 1: Hey girl, you want some tail?

963
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:00,615
Speaker 1: Flick.

964
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:03,940
Speaker 1: Ron, your tail is small.

965
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:04,156
Speaker 1: What?
