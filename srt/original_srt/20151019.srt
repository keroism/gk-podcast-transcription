1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,439
Speaker 0: It's Monday, September 19th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:10,781
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:13,690
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,615
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nods tonight.

5
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:17,902
Speaker 0: Never share your password with anyone.

6
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:18,504
Speaker 0: Ever.

7
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,470
Speaker 0: Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

8
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:22,890
Speaker 1: And anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone.

9
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:24,988
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,850
Speaker 0: So this weekend we went upstate, me and Scott and Emily and a whole bunch of our friends, and we went to a haunted house.

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,117
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't a haunted house.

12
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:34,970
Speaker 1: It was like a haunted playland.

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,222
Speaker 0: It was a haunted $40 land.

14
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:37,532
Speaker 1: Yeah.

15
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:41,950
Speaker 1: That's a lot of money because you can go to a Six Flags for $40 with one of those sale ticket things.

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, well for $25 more a person, we could add a Scream Pass and skip the lines.

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,506
Speaker 1: The only one line was long enough to warrant skipping and not $25 worth.

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:51,630
Speaker 0: Yup.

19
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:53,584
Speaker 0: I mean, I wouldn't pay $25 to skip lines at Cedar Point.

20
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:55,970
Speaker 1: How much is a Cedar Point ticket?

21
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:59,550
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, it was like $70 to get in for a whole day.

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,550
Speaker 1: How much is a Disney World ticket?

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,468
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

24
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,650
Speaker 1: I don't usually buy a three-day, three-park pass, but how much is like a one-day, one-park pass?

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,430
Speaker 0: I have no idea, but I'm going to Disney World on Halloween, so I actually got to figure out, I got to buy tickets.

26
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,220
Speaker 1: I'm sure you can afford it, but it's expensive.

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,144
Speaker 1: It's hundreds of dollars.

28
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:15,248
Speaker 1: when I was there in the '90s.

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,690
Speaker 0: I will know, but luckily the hotel is cheap because it's part of a wedding block, so it kind of evens out.

30
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:20,130
Speaker 1: Yeah.

31
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:23,330
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, anything in Florida is cheap except tickets to Disney World.

32
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:36,150
Speaker 0: But the reason I bring this up, and this isn't what the show is about, but we went to this crazy haunted experience with a hayride and a bunch of stuff, with a headless horseman, and as far as I can tell, everyone who lives in the entire upstate region was there.

33
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:38,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was way crowded, more crowded than I expected.

34
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,306
Speaker 1: I expected it to be mad lame, but they were like hyping it up, so I'm like, "All right, fine.

35
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:44,650
Speaker 1: I'll pay $40.

36
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,469
Speaker 1: It seems like a lot of money, and I'll go check this thing

37
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:46,550
Speaker 1: out.".

38
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,495
Speaker 0: Scott messaged me before.

39
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:49,988
Speaker 0: He's like, "Someone's getting I Told You So, and it's either going to be them or

40
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:50,129
Speaker 0: me.".

41
00:01:50,370 --> 00:02:04,310
Speaker 1: Right, so the problem was is that on the one hand, it wasn't awesome, so I really wanted to give them an I Told You So, but on the other hand, the production value was so high, I couldn't make an argument that it was super lame to deliver the I Told You So.

42
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,010
Speaker 0: I got about $40 worth of entertainment out of the whole thing.

43
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,437
Speaker 0: Maybe

44
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:09,131
Speaker 0: $20. $25.30,

45
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:09,681
Speaker 0: it was good.

46
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, not

47
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:11,473
Speaker 1: $40. $40

48
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:15,044
Speaker 1: was like, "If you, Ted, hey, do you want to do this again next year?

49
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:16,889
Speaker 1: We changed everything, but it's the same production

50
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:17,090
Speaker 1: level.".

51
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:17,552
Speaker 1: I'd be like, "How

52
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:17,733
Speaker 1: much?".

53
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:18,316
Speaker 1: He'd be like,

54
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:18,356
Speaker 1: "$40?".

55
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:19,481
Speaker 1: I'd be like, "No.

56
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:20,224
Speaker 1: $20?

57
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,028
Speaker 1: Maybe if it's not cold

58
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:21,209
Speaker 1: out.".

59
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,427
Speaker 0: But if they were like, "We've upgraded that giant vagina you had to go

60
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:24,688
Speaker 0: through.".

61
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:26,426
Speaker 1: Ooh, that was one of the best parts.

62
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,269
Speaker 0: They could have used that to scare people way more than they did.

63
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:30,930
Speaker 1: They can't touch people.

64
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:36,090
Speaker 0: Remember the bee room where they had the little strings that felt like bugs touching your face?

65
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,430
Speaker 1: Well, it felt a lot like they were pretty much going for the throw paint against the wall method.

66
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,295
Speaker 1: Like, "Alright, you're not scared of zombies?

67
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:45,780
Speaker 1: Alright, we got a place with bees.

68
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,763
Speaker 1: We got a place with spiders.

69
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:47,285
Speaker 1: We got ghosts.

70
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:47,526
Speaker 1: We got

71
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:47,827
Speaker 1: clowns.".

72
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:56,530
Speaker 0: One of them was just a motel, and as you went, it was basically like the same motel room over and over again, but worse and worse and scarier.

73
00:02:56,871 --> 00:02:58,376
Speaker 0: The toilet just got worse, mostly.

74
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:02,149
Speaker 0: Like, every time you came around a corner, it's like, "That toilet is worse than the last toilet I

75
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:02,430
Speaker 0: saw.".

76
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:02,912
Speaker 1: Well, it's a motel.

77
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,876
Speaker 1: There's a lot of toilets, right?

78
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:06,729
Speaker 1: But it's pretty much like, "There's something you're scared of, and we're gonna have it

79
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:06,890
Speaker 1: here.".

80
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:15,070
Speaker 0: I mean, even if you're just like me and Scott, they're like, "Okay, for those people, we're just gonna have someone hiding in a place they would never see, and just literally jump scare them at the best possible

81
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,210
Speaker 0: moment.".

82
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,830
Speaker 1: The giant clown was hiding behind the sign, and I'm just walking slowly, just checking stuff out.

83
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,140
Speaker 1: I'm mostly looking at the elaborate sets they've made.

84
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,929
Speaker 1: Like, "Whoa, these are really elaborate and

85
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:24,210
Speaker 1: awesome.".

86
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,319
Speaker 1: Just inspecting them to see how cool they are.

87
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,609
Speaker 1: Trying to go slowly, but they sort of push you along, right?

88
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:32,081
Speaker 1: They put so much detail into things, you don't want to go slow.

89
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:34,430
Speaker 1: You want to hang out and see what's going on.

90
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,430
Speaker 0: Like, there were skeletons deeply and elaborately inserted inside of a lot of things.

91
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:47,330
Speaker 1: Like, in the motel, there's a person in a room, and there's all these pictures on the wall, and all these props all stuck together.

92
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:50,384
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's like some scary library.

93
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,390
Speaker 1: I want to look at all the books.

94
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:59,369
Speaker 1: But, you know, I'm just looking behind the sign, and this clown is hiding behind there, and I think he saw that I was coming to look into his hiding spot.

95
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:08,507
Speaker 0: But, the one thing I want to say, this specific place, like, they have a hayride park, where I guess every year they have, like, this narrative.

96
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:09,570
Speaker 0: Like, there's a story about the headless horseman.

97
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,462
Speaker 1: It made no fucking sense.

98
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:12,570
Speaker 1: Why even have it?

99
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:16,910
Speaker 0: That was, like, you might think this is a weird thing to say about a haunted house.

100
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,550
Speaker 1: It didn't help that the person on our hayride really wasn't putting in a big effort.

101
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,621
Speaker 0: She was giving the desultory, "I am the witch, Hex, and I am smallpox something.

102
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,526
Speaker 0: Oh no, the headless horseman.

103
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:28,789
Speaker 0: You will never defeat

104
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:29,069
Speaker 0: me.".

105
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:33,790
Speaker 1: The thing is, all the other actors who were actually along the way, they seem to be trying harder.

106
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:47,950
Speaker 0: But, the overwroughtness of the plot, like, the plot of this haunted hayride was more than, like, 52 episodes of a For Real anime in terms of the amount of stuff.

107
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,235
Speaker 1: And how are there, like, every single possible scary thing?

108
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:59,450
Speaker 1: There was a pirate land, and a creepy western place, and a creepy colonial place, and a Dracula, and a Frankenstein.

109
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:09,106
Speaker 0: Like, there's all these villagers covered in pox marks, and they're all being hung, and there's this wizard guy, and the guy's like, "The headless horseman doesn't want these villagers.

110
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:10,348
Speaker 0: They're infected with

111
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:11,370
Speaker 0: smallpox.".

112
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,573
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Okay, that's oddly

113
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:14,094
Speaker 0: specific.".

114
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:16,678
Speaker 0: But then, smallpox kept coming up.

115
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:24,790
Speaker 0: Like, smallpox and some other virus are a big part of that story that I don't understand at all.

116
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:27,429
Speaker 1: But the sets are really nice.

117
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were.

118
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:28,965
Speaker 0: Like, at one point...

119
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,590
Speaker 1: Whoever makes those things probably does make sets for movies, but they should probably just quit that and make sets for movies.

120
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:42,765
Speaker 1: But wait, that place was making 40 bucks a head at least, times a big long line of people, times every night in October.

121
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:45,270
Speaker 1: I don't think you need another job if you own that shit.

122
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:45,657
Speaker 0: Yeah.

123
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,300
Speaker 1: I mean, it probably costs a lot.

124
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:48,430
Speaker 1: You gotta pay the land.

125
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,202
Speaker 0: How much could that land cost?

126
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:51,270
Speaker 0: It's upstate New York.

127
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:53,060
Speaker 1: There's a lot of cost involved.

128
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:54,690
Speaker 1: Making all those sets was not cheap.

129
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,430
Speaker 0: And you can only run this thing for a month a year, basically.

130
00:05:57,571 --> 00:05:59,219
Speaker 1: Right, you're paying for the cops to be there.

131
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,250
Speaker 1: If it rains, no one's showing up that day.

132
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,080
Speaker 0: Also, there were actually a lot of cops there, and a lot of security.

133
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:08,750
Speaker 0: Like, New York MSG level of security.

134
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,190
Speaker 1: I don't know what problems they had in the past.

135
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,012
Speaker 0: And it wasn't just that.

136
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:12,236
Speaker 0: We went apple picking in the morning.

137
00:06:12,597 --> 00:06:13,300
Speaker 0: Same deal.

138
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,286
Speaker 0: They're like, "We're gonna search your car,

139
00:06:15,346 --> 00:06:15,828
Speaker 0: maybe.".

140
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,475
Speaker 1: Well, that apple place is super paranoid that people are gonna steal apples.

141
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:25,946
Speaker 1: And it's like, "Dude, your apples are more expensive than the apples I get next to my house, which are also upstate New York apples.

142
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:27,769
Speaker 1: And they taste just the

143
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:28,050
Speaker 1: same.".

144
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,270
Speaker 0: But is there that much autumnal crime in upstate New York that this is a thing?

145
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,815
Speaker 1: I don't know.

146
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:35,422
Speaker 1: Maybe when it gets cold, people run out of money.

147
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:35,984
Speaker 1: They gotta steal.

148
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:37,470
Speaker 1: They buy holiday presents.

149
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,435
Speaker 0: But really, I can't express this enough.

150
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:44,929
Speaker 0: Like, you might think, "Rim is exaggerating about the overwroughtness and complexity of the plot of this haunted

151
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:45,370
Speaker 0: hayride.".

152
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:57,170
Speaker 0: I'd love to read the script, but I think it might end... Like, you would need a... R. Scott Bakker would have trouble summarizing this in the body of works he's written to date.

153
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,509
Speaker 0: Smallpox came up, like, 40 times.

154
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:01,144
Speaker 1: I don't know.

155
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,395
Speaker 0: So, it's Monday.

156
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:04,339
Speaker 0: It's not the lounge.

157
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,042
Speaker 0: Tech News Day.

158
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:06,910
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of news that we didn't talk about.

159
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,990
Speaker 0: And one thing I want to talk about is kinda... It's not new news, but it's a topic many of you haven't thought about.

160
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:21,130
Speaker 0: So, when I was a young lad, if you wanted to run an email server in the old days, like in the '90s, you could just start an email server and connect it to the internet.

161
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,859
Speaker 1: I mean, it was hard.

162
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,730
Speaker 1: Did you send mail?

163
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, you had to know computers.

164
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,769
Speaker 1: But, I mean, I can't even set up send mail now.

165
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:27,981
Speaker 0: I could back then.

166
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:28,549
Speaker 0: I can't now.

167
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:31,070
Speaker 1: I could... I mean, you took the class that taught you that.

168
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:31,388
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.

169
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,193
Speaker 1: I never did.

170
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:37,570
Speaker 1: So, I mean, like, I could read documentation on how to do it, and even with that, I wasn't able to do it.

171
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,283
Speaker 1: With documentation, I was able to set up pretty much every other kind of application out there.

172
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:43,270
Speaker 1: A little Apache, a little FTP, all that.

173
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,870
Speaker 1: Now, part of that was that email... But I couldn't set up email because it was so fucking complicated.

174
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,210
Speaker 0: Email used to be, like, in the old days... You know, email is one of these old internet protocols.

175
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:59,110
Speaker 1: Right, but if I knew what I was doing, I could have theoretically set up an email server, and it had a domain, and started sending and receiving emails to and from that domain.

176
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,010
Speaker 1: And I partially succeeded a couple times.

177
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, we even Scott and I...

178
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,749
Speaker 1: And then I said, "Fuck it, let's Google do

179
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:03,810
Speaker 1: it.".

180
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,350
Speaker 0: We had a squirrel mail server for webmail for a while.

181
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:06,677
Speaker 0: Yeah.

182
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:07,548
Speaker 0: That was cool.

183
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:11,590
Speaker 0: It never quite worked 100%, but it worked better than the RIT email.

184
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:12,990
Speaker 0: I used to telnet...

185
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:14,329
Speaker 1: My RIT emails worked great.

186
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,268
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, if you knew how to telnet into the VAX cluster...

187
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:18,375
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.

188
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,904
Speaker 1: I always use my cs.rit.edu email.

189
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, the IT team used, like, IT, we also had addresses, but they used a different system.

190
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:37,789
Speaker 0: So I used the regular RIT email, which you could either telnet into Gracie, which was this old Unix cluster, or you could telnet into the VAX, which was literally open VMS, like, dear God.

191
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,770
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure they retired those and replaced them with a bunch of Sun machines or something.

192
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,253
Speaker 0: But think about this.

193
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:46,749
Speaker 0: Like, everyone who got to RIT, like, email was not... Like, I know a lot of people who didn't have email addresses when we got to RIT.

194
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,931
Speaker 0: Like, I don't think, like, there was a different time in the year 2000.

195
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:59,030
Speaker 0: Most kids who got to RIT left behind their email address because it was, like, something.comcast.net that they couldn't take with them.

196
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,130
Speaker 1: Mine was, like, snet.net, when SMET was still a phone company.

197
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,469
Speaker 0: I had a Prodigy internet address still at that time.

198
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:05,969
Speaker 1: And before that, there was an AOL one.

199
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:06,650
Speaker 0: Yup.

200
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:08,194
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah.

201
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:14,470
Speaker 0: But if you knew what you were doing, you could set up an email server, and if you just connected it to the internet, it worked.

202
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,750
Speaker 0: A problem with email as a service and a protocol is that it's an old protocol.

203
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,091
Speaker 1: Right.

204
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:27,910
Speaker 1: The way it was originally designed was, like, if you couldn't reach the place you were trying to send the email to, you would just send the email to someone else, and then they would try to pass it on.

205
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,920
Speaker 0: Like, send it to anyone.

206
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:29,690
Speaker 1: Like, who cares?

207
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:36,445
Speaker 1: Like, I'm trying to send an email to google.com, and I can't find google.com, so I'm going to send the email to whoever I find.

208
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:38,490
Speaker 1: I'll send it to, I don't know, rim.com.

209
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:39,690
Speaker 0: And then rim.com will be like...

210
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,230
Speaker 1: rim.com will actually do a best effort to try to get that email over to google.com.

211
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:50,710
Speaker 0: Because remember, old internet protocols, like all the old shit, that was designed to survive a nuclear strike against the United States.

212
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,070
Speaker 0: Yup.

213
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,130
Speaker 0: So it was designed to just kind of work no matter what.

214
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,863
Speaker 0: And also, in those days, there really wasn't spam or trolling or shitposting.

215
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:03,470
Speaker 0: Like, everyone on the internet was cool.

216
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,789
Speaker 0: In fact, the year 2000 was sort of like the tipping point where that stopped being true bit by bit.

217
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:16,150
Speaker 0: So, email had a problem once normal people got access to it, and spam appeared, and all these other problems.

218
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,290
Speaker 0: You know, skip, skip, skip, skip, current day.

219
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:26,010
Speaker 0: You can still, if you're an IT person, go read the documentation to like, send mail or something, and make a mail server.

220
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,789
Speaker 0: Totally fine, connected to the internet, and pretty much no one will ever get any email from you.

221
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:41,970
Speaker 0: People hated spam so much that they decided that they would rather miss real email and give up on an open internet than even let one spam through.

222
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:51,430
Speaker 0: So the average email service will just block emails from anyone it doesn't trust, and it pretty much only trusts big companies that are already running big email servers.

223
00:10:52,331 --> 00:11:00,930
Speaker 0: So, my Gmail will go out fine, and anyone who already has big email infrastructure that has not had a spam problem happen is fine.

224
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,410
Speaker 0: No new email system will pretty much ever exist ever for the future of forever.

225
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:15,510
Speaker 1: I mean, you can start a new email system, you just need to like, you know, go have meetings and talk to people who run bigger email systems to tell them to trust you.

226
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,017
Speaker 0: This article is about, that actually isn't even true anymore.

227
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:22,950
Speaker 0: Like, you pretty much cannot get your mail server to work with any corporate network.

228
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:30,190
Speaker 0: Like, even if you get a lot of people, even big companies, to trust you, odds are an average person you send an email to won't get your emails.

229
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:31,152
Speaker 1: Maybe.

230
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,330
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, if you get Google to trust you, you're pretty much set, right?

231
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,150
Speaker 0: You might not be able to get Google to trust you.

232
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,669
Speaker 1: It's not easy, but it can be done.

233
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:41,930
Speaker 1: But the thing is, you can always send your emails through someone else, right?

234
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,397
Speaker 1: So, at work, we send a ton of emails.

235
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:46,330
Speaker 1: I mean, not a super ton, but we send a bunch, and they all get through.

236
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:54,330
Speaker 1: And the reason that is, is because you use Amazon SES, where basically, I use SMTP to tell Amazon SES to send the email for me.

237
00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:05,070
Speaker 1: But I also point some DNS records at Amazon SES, and I give it permissions, so I can send an email from or to anyone at our domains.

238
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,330
Speaker 0: But, now you're dependent upon Amazon, which is fine.

239
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:14,650
Speaker 1: I mean, there's other services that do the same thing, like SendGrid, and MailChimp has some competing things, I forget what it's called, Mandrake or something.

240
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:19,510
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of different mail services you can use, either for mailing lists or just mail servers.

241
00:12:19,911 --> 00:12:22,330
Speaker 1: You just point some DNS records, and you can start using them.

242
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:32,150
Speaker 0: But you pretty much have to use a service that gets identifying information from you, because anything that's more anonymized probably will get blocked for spam reasons.

243
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,890
Speaker 1: If you want to be anonymous, why use a fucking email?

244
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:40,330
Speaker 0: But that's interesting, because the original protocol was designed so that anyone can send a message to anyone, anywhere in the world, no matter what.

245
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:46,930
Speaker 0: And it turns out that humans would pretty much don't actually ever want a service like that ever.

246
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:48,195
Speaker 1: Nope.

247
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,144
Speaker 1: Why would you?

248
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:51,154
Speaker 0: Well, I did.

249
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,470
Speaker 0: I mean, remember Orkut, the first social network that we used?

250
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,754
Speaker 0: The first social network?

251
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:58,530
Speaker 0: It was great, because it had no controls for spam whatsoever.

252
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,628
Speaker 0: And it was awesome until the first shitbird got in, and then the entire service was ruined within 24 hours.

253
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:06,914
Speaker 0: So yeah, email's dead.

254
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:09,100
Speaker 0: Pretty much you have Gmail.

255
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,710
Speaker 0: You have some other service that lets you send electronic messages.

256
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,084
Speaker 0: But email, the original protocol, is for all intents and purposes dead.

257
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:18,850
Speaker 0: You don't need to know anything about it.

258
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,927
Speaker 1: Well, you still use it.

259
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,874
Speaker 0: Well yeah, but you use it the same way.

260
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:23,418
Speaker 0: you use old roads.

261
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:27,730
Speaker 0: The infrastructure, the political system that created the interstates is dead.

262
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:29,349
Speaker 0: Yet, the interstates remain.

263
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:32,029
Speaker 0: Got any news?

264
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Lenovo, you should never buy a computer from ever again.

265
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,550
Speaker 0: Ever, ever, ever again.

266
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,754
Speaker 1: Because you can't trust them.

267
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:41,108
Speaker 1: But they're making something that I always question, like, "Why hasn't anyone made

268
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:41,309
Speaker 1: this?".

269
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,237
Speaker 1: They're making basically a giant table computer.

270
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:48,750
Speaker 1: It's like a 20-something-inch, 27-inch, so really not that big.

271
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,543
Speaker 0: Oh, it looks like it's about the same size as the new Nexus 5X.

272
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:52,870
Speaker 1: Hey-oh!

273
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:57,279
Speaker 1: It's 1,600 bucks, and it's a computer.

274
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:58,623
Speaker 1: It's just big.

275
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:00,790
Speaker 1: It's also a coffee table, basically.

276
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:05,490
Speaker 1: That's the thing that I kind of wanted at some point in my life.

277
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,430
Speaker 0: I've always wanted that.

278
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,510
Speaker 1: Not now, but it's taken this long for someone to make something so obvious.

279
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:11,865
Speaker 0: I mean, I've always...

280
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,290
Speaker 1: I guess you could have always just taken a television and just laid it flat and put a computer under it, but it wouldn't have a touchscreen.

281
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,530
Speaker 0: Well, also, most televisions don't have a great viewing angle unless you pay a lot of money.

282
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:31,529
Speaker 1: Right, and Microsoft tried to make the original Microsoft Surface, not the current one, but the original one, which was like a projector onto the bottom of a table, and the people were playing D&D with it, and then they stopped using it.

283
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:35,670
Speaker 1: Except for I think one hotel has one in their lobby somewhere.

284
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,024
Speaker 0: The PAX East main hotel had it down there.

285
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:38,830
Speaker 0: It might not still be there.

286
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, as like a demo kiosk thing.

287
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:45,109
Speaker 1: But it's like, "Hey, that's actually a thing you could have in your

288
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:45,430
Speaker 1: house.".

289
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,512
Speaker 1: And it's like, "Why the hell

290
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:46,993
Speaker 1: not?".

291
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:56,890
Speaker 1: I guess it's really not that much better than, say, you have an iPad in your lap and you watch TV versus having your coffee table be an iPad and watch...

292
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,950
Speaker 0: But I wouldn't want to watch TV on it because I've got to look down.

293
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:00,572
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

294
00:15:00,593 --> 00:15:03,490
Speaker 1: You use it to, say, choose channels or...

295
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:04,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, iPad still...

296
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,421
Speaker 1: But it's like holding an iPad for that is just better.

297
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,370
Speaker 1: Holding the Wii U tablet for that is just better.

298
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,929
Speaker 0: To me still, the only use case for this kind of thing...

299
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:12,307
Speaker 1: Board games.

300
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:13,252
Speaker 0: Yes.

301
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,219
Speaker 0: It's not useful for generic computing.

302
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,150
Speaker 0: The apps that use it need to be designed for a shared screen where people are sitting around it.

303
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,049
Speaker 1: But it's like they're talking about using it for photo editing.

304
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,010
Speaker 1: That's stupid.

305
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:25,713
Speaker 1: Why?

306
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:27,490
Speaker 1: That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

307
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:42,330
Speaker 0: A long time ago when 3D mice started appearing and all these haptic interfaces and touch screens started appearing, it became apparent immediately that for most things you use a computer for, a mouse or trackball and a keyboard is still the best interface with a screen in front of your face.

308
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:50,690
Speaker 1: One thing it seems they did get right with this is that it is battery powered and it can work with battery for a few hours and it has a little stand so you can kick it up.

309
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,710
Speaker 1: So you could take this with you, say camping, and play a little digital board game in the woods with it.

310
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,070
Speaker 0: The problem is most digital board games aren't designed for this kind of display.

311
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:00,871
Speaker 1: Yeah, no kidding.

312
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:03,197
Speaker 1: But I'm saying you just buy one of these, erase it.

313
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:08,830
Speaker 1: so Lenovo doesn't mess with you and don't do anything with it except make board games for it and play them.

314
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,258
Speaker 0: But that's it.

315
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:09,626
Speaker 0: It's a Catch-22.

316
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,059
Speaker 1: But you can just use an iPad for that and you don't want to give Lenovo money so fuck them.

317
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:14,704
Speaker 1: But please someone else make this.

318
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,790
Speaker 1: Or someone make a little stand for you to put an iPad on.

319
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:23,390
Speaker 1: This is useless unless it basically got the Nintendo treatment and someone was- Maybe I'll make a little stand for the iPad Pro and then you can play board games.

320
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:25,030
Speaker 0: But it needs first party apps.

321
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm saying it would be a console.

322
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,119
Speaker 1: There's a ton of first party apps.

323
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:30,409
Speaker 1: You know how many board games there are for iPads?

324
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, and most of them really are still not designed for a bunch of people sitting around a big table playing.

325
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,329
Speaker 1: Actually a lot of them are.

326
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:37,889
Speaker 0: But the interface is not great.

327
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:40,670
Speaker 1: As long as you look away at someone's hand for a TV show.

328
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,803
Speaker 0: Yeah, with a giant table that's a problem.

329
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:43,890
Speaker 0: That's a big problem.

330
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:44,742
Speaker 1: It's not your turn.

331
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:45,230
Speaker 1: Just look away.

332
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,019
Speaker 0: That's not happening.

333
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,810
Speaker 0: I'm not looking away.

334
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,045
Speaker 1: Anyway.

335
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,953
Speaker 0: But yeah, this is just a Catch-22.

336
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:55,150
Speaker 0: You would need first party software to make this good and it can't be productivity software because that's stupid on this form factor.

337
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,630
Speaker 0: No one's going to make those games because not everyone owns one of these.

338
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,064
Speaker 1: I don't know why they're making this.

339
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:00,590
Speaker 1: I don't understand.

340
00:17:01,113 --> 00:17:01,200
Speaker 0: Yeah.

341
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,509
Speaker 1: Everyone else made it and it's like yeah, there's like five people who want this and you went ahead and made it.

342
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:06,810
Speaker 1: Why?

343
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,829
Speaker 0: So yeah, but it doesn't matter because it's Lenovo.

344
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:18,250
Speaker 0: Anyway, things of the day.

345
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,256
Speaker 0: So I follow this blog.

346
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:23,509
Speaker 0: It's called War is Borrowing and it's a pretty good blog about war stuff.

347
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,845
Speaker 0: Like historical war stuff, current war stuff.

348
00:17:26,886 --> 00:17:27,670
Speaker 0: It's pretty well informed.

349
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,050
Speaker 0: But this particular article is very interesting.

350
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:43,510
Speaker 0: It talks about a very specific case during World War II where the allies were trying to assist our own POW stuck in Germany in escaping from BOW camps and rejoining the fight.

351
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,210
Speaker 0: And they did this primarily by hiding information.

352
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,427
Speaker 1: I thought it was shovels.

353
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,396
Speaker 0: No, hiding information.

354
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,524
Speaker 0: Shovels and all that nonsense were not that useful.

355
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:54,970
Speaker 0: Like that you can get on your own.

356
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,410
Speaker 0: People needed maps, compasses, that kind of shit.

357
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:00,530
Speaker 1: Oh, because once you escape, you don't know where the fuck to go.

358
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,133
Speaker 0: Exactly.

359
00:18:01,174 --> 00:18:02,688
Speaker 0: I mean, so say I took you...

360
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:03,590
Speaker 1: You didn't have your GPS?

361
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,013
Speaker 0: So Scott, let's say I took you.

362
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:10,130
Speaker 0: You and me get blindfolded and dropped off somewhere in upstate New York.

363
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:13,590
Speaker 0: How do we find our way home without asking someone?

364
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:16,310
Speaker 0: That's the problem they were facing.

365
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,689
Speaker 1: As soon as I hit like a road, I can see the signs on it.

366
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,606
Speaker 0: Maybe, but okay, so you see a town, Bumble Fuck, New York.

367
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:22,130
Speaker 0: Where is that?

368
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:24,707
Speaker 0: It's not a town you recognize.

369
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,790
Speaker 1: No matter where I am, I know New York because I studied it before I got here.

370
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,590
Speaker 1: So I'll just pick one direction and walk in that direction.

371
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,536
Speaker 1: And I'll know that let's say I head north.

372
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:41,190
Speaker 1: I'm either going to hit Canada, a river that I know.

373
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,949
Speaker 1: I find north by the space and the sun and shit.

374
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:47,833
Speaker 1: I-90.

375
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,670
Speaker 1: Or I'm going to find one of these things just by continuing north.

376
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,710
Speaker 1: And then once I find one of those things, I'm set.

377
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,849
Speaker 0: Alright, you're in a town called Bernard's and you don't know where that is.

378
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:06,826
Speaker 1: I'll just walk east and I know I'm either going to find Elmira, Coxsackie, the Hudson River, Connecticut, or Vermont.

379
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:15,670
Speaker 0: You immediately hit a river that is itself called the Passaic River, but that river name exists in a lot of places around America.

380
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,069
Speaker 1: But I know that I'm in New York.

381
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:18,470
Speaker 0: Alright, so you're all New Jersey.

382
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:20,042
Speaker 1: Okay.

383
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:20,773
Speaker 1: Alright.

384
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:21,801
Speaker 0: Anyway, so...

385
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,488
Speaker 1: I'm getting closer.

386
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,270
Speaker 0: They hid maps and things in places.

387
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:31,450
Speaker 1: Listen, being lost and alive is better than hanging out with Nazis and being alive.

388
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:39,170
Speaker 0: Nah, because if you escape from POW camp and they catch you and they know you as the guy who escaped once already, I suspect it's not as pleasant as it was the first time around.

389
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,690
Speaker 1: I mean, by the time I escaped, aren't I just like some American who's lost in the woods?

390
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:46,910
Speaker 0: I don't think any American lost in the woods in Germany in World War II was just sent on his way.

391
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,685
Speaker 1: Maybe I just got separated from all my dudes.

392
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:49,230
Speaker 1: They all died.

393
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:53,370
Speaker 0: But totally, they modified Monopoly boards and hid all the shit in board games.

394
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,080
Speaker 1: Why did the Nazis let board games through?

395
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:57,890
Speaker 1: Why didn't they check them for stuff?

396
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,328
Speaker 0: That's what this story is.

397
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:01,250
Speaker 1: Okay.

398
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,415
Speaker 0: It's really fascinating.

399
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,821
Speaker 0: It's my thing of the day.

400
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:05,910
Speaker 0: It's an article that I recommend you all read.

401
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,820
Speaker 1: And I hope, you know, were we checking the board games?

402
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,050
Speaker 1: I mean, if they were sending over some settlers or whatever?

403
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:14,289
Speaker 0: Ah, this only talks about our plan to let our POWs out.

404
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,869
Speaker 1: Yes, hide chiseled sheep.

405
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,669
Speaker 0: So one thing they did is, under the Monopoly money, it was just real fucking money.

406
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:25,750
Speaker 0: That's one of the things they did, and it totally worked.

407
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,250
Speaker 1: Such a great hiding place.

408
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,158
Speaker 0: It totally worked.

409
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,230
Speaker 0: They didn't check that thoroughly.

410
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,130
Speaker 1: Why are they not checking so thoroughly?

411
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:32,330
Speaker 0: Read the article and you'll see.

412
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,780
Speaker 1: Such lame checking.

413
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:35,684
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

414
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:37,010
Speaker 1: The TSA is better than that.

415
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:37,771
Speaker 0: Ah.

416
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:40,270
Speaker 0: Anyway.

417
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,870
Speaker 1: I mean, the TSA will even find you three ounces of lotions.

418
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,913
Speaker 1: Alright, so, thing of the day.

419
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:49,990
Speaker 1: So you ever want to, like, you know, make a video of some computer usage, right?

420
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,337
Speaker 1: For, like, tutorial purposes?

421
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,630
Speaker 1: Like, you want to show someone something you did on your computer.

422
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,330
Speaker 1: But, uh, the thing you're showing them, you know, is just in a terminal.

423
00:20:58,711 --> 00:21:04,710
Speaker 1: So it's almost like, why would I deliver to you this video of my terminal in, like, MPEG form?

424
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,115
Speaker 1: That's kind of, like, inefficient.

425
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:10,450
Speaker 1: And it kind of sucks, because, like, even if you see the video, you're, like, constantly pausing it.

426
00:21:10,952 --> 00:21:13,622
Speaker 1: And you can't, like, you know, stop and reread things.

427
00:21:13,662 --> 00:21:15,650
Speaker 1: And you definitely can't copy and paste out of the MPEG.

428
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,170
Speaker 1: My text, which would be super helpful.

429
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,383
Speaker 1: So this is a website called Ask Cinema, or ASCII.

430
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,370
Speaker 1: It's a combination of the word ASCII and cinema.

431
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,570
Speaker 1: It's ASCII Cinema, but the cinema and the ASCII are touching.

432
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,003
Speaker 0: Oh, they give you a pronunciation, God.

433
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:28,690
Speaker 0: It's ASCII-nima.

434
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,362
Speaker 1: Don't fuck yourself.

435
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:30,689
Speaker 1: Anyway.

436
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:33,230
Speaker 0: That's the, that's the canonical machinima, GIF.

437
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got any GIFs over there?

438
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:49,750
Speaker 1: And this website has tools which make it very, very easy to record and upload and display and share videos of things you did in your terminal that are very easy to watch and copy and paste from, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

439
00:21:49,890 --> 00:22:04,150
Speaker 1: So if you want to make some tutorials, teach people how to do things in terminals, or maybe just show coworkers or, you know, demo products that have command line interfaces or anything like that, this is an awesome thing to use, so do that.

440
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:07,370
Speaker 1: And also make MPEG-4 for backup in case something happens to this website.

441
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,516
Speaker 0: In the meantime, the Book Club book was The Wheel of Time.

442
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:13,624
Speaker 0: We're done with The Wheel of Time, book one, and we did an episode on it.

443
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:16,030
Speaker 0: We're burning through book five.

444
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:18,341
Speaker 1: I'm in the early pages of book five, like 10%.

445
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:20,029
Speaker 1: It's like chapter three or four.

446
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:31,368
Speaker 0: So if you were wondering if you should read the first book of The Wheel of Time to then listen to our Book Club episode on the first book of The Wheel of Time, all I'll say is we somehow kept reading.

447
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:32,530
Speaker 0: We're kind of burning through these books.

448
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,078
Speaker 1: I mean, it's exactly what we always said every time we mentioned it.

449
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:40,669
Speaker 1: It's generic fantasy, but it's generic fantasy and you're a nerd, so you like that, right?

450
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:41,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, you do.

451
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,274
Speaker 0: And you know what?

452
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:43,302
Speaker 0: You care about world building?

453
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:44,290
Speaker 0: There's a lot of that in there.

454
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,108
Speaker 1: It's nothing but nerd fantasy, so just read it because you're a nerd and that's it.

455
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,290
Speaker 0: And then you'll know why I keep saying that Matt needs to shut the fuck up.

456
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:56,830
Speaker 1: Or read something else that has some sort of literary merit.

457
00:22:57,051 --> 00:23:00,843
Speaker 0: Otherwise we have no big conventions until Magfest, which you should go to.

458
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:02,910
Speaker 0: Oh, but I think it's sold out of hotel rooms.

459
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,870
Speaker 0: So many people we know were unable to get hotel rooms because they did not listen to us.

460
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:15,323
Speaker 0: We told you so.

461
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,669
Speaker 0: With every convention.

462
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,323
Speaker 1: So you had been told by us and you did not listen.

463
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:23,030
Speaker 1: We were right again.

464
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:24,373
Speaker 0: And I'll tell you this.

465
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:25,255
Speaker 0: I'll make a new prediction.

466
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:30,287
Speaker 0: Next year, it's going to be as hard as PAX fucking East to get a hotel for Magfest.

467
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:31,470
Speaker 0: Mark my words.

468
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:34,864
Speaker 0: Even if you listen to us, you might not get one next year.

469
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:36,110
Speaker 0: That's my prediction.

470
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:39,190
Speaker 1: You're going to have to get on top of those internets.

471
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, do some Airbnb nonsense.

472
00:23:41,702 --> 00:23:42,728
Speaker 0: You got to get an angle.

473
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,778
Speaker 1: There is one secret technique to getting a hotel room for Magfest.

474
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,462
Speaker 1: That technique is BOAT.

475
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:50,447
Speaker 1: It's National Harbor.

476
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:51,710
Speaker 1: It literally is on the water.

477
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,939
Speaker 1: You could pay some money to dock a boat there.

478
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,565
Speaker 0: Magfest website has directions.

479
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:56,850
Speaker 0: Like how are you getting here?

480
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,036
Speaker 0: And one of the options is boat.

481
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:00,470
Speaker 0: If you click on it, like, yeah, they totally tell you how to do that.

482
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,589
Speaker 1: If you get a boat somewhere, you don't have to worry about hotel as long as there's a bed on that boat.

483
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,240
Speaker 1: And the boat is not too big.

484
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,310
Speaker 1: Like cruise ship probably too big.

485
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,756
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

486
00:24:12,857 --> 00:24:16,030
Speaker 0: Otherwise our Patreon will be starting up at some point in the near future.

487
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,772
Speaker 0: I got some other work.

488
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:24,730
Speaker 0: I got to finish first, but you ever wanted to hear those pre-release episodes of Geek Nights from the early days of 2005?

489
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,810
Speaker 1: Because we have nothing else of value or interest to give away to people who give us money.

490
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:32,979
Speaker 0: As we said before, we sang our own theme song in those days.

491
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,050
Speaker 0: Like we sang a song for you at the opening of every episode.

492
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,869
Speaker 0: I think maybe 20 people in the world have ever heard those episodes.

493
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:53,290
Speaker 0: So if the thousand, like 14, however many crazy episodes we've done of Geek Nights over the years are not enough, if you donate to our Patreon, I'm going to trickle out a bunch of episodes that have never been on the internet before.

494
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:55,372
Speaker 1: All right.

495
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,962
Speaker 1: So, Rym wanted to do an episode on this.

496
00:24:58,002 --> 00:25:00,230
Speaker 1: I think we've talked about this before many, many times.

497
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,950
Speaker 0: I think we talked about it a lot in general in our lives, mostly Scott.

498
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,830
Speaker 1: But it keeps coming up, especially in the tech news all the time.

499
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,721
Speaker 1: And I'm like, man, we remind people of backups.

500
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,110
Speaker 1: By the way, backup everything all the time, always.

501
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,511
Speaker 0: Yeah.

502
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:15,469
Speaker 0: And if you're lazy, like I tweeted a little bit about this.

503
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:16,627
Speaker 1: Back your shit up.

504
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,287
Speaker 0: If you have a NAS, just a NAS, that's not a backup.

505
00:25:20,327 --> 00:25:20,910
Speaker 0: That's redundancy.

506
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:21,573
Speaker 1: Yeah.

507
00:25:21,593 --> 00:25:23,870
Speaker 1: We've definitely talked about backing stuff up before enough.

508
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:24,687
Speaker 0: But I do now.

509
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,730
Speaker 1: We're just reminding you because it's never bad to remind you.

510
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,290
Speaker 1: But something we've talked about a lot, but I think it also always bear repeating.

511
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,490
Speaker 1: And I don't think a hundred percent we've done an episode on, but even if we had, that's okay.

512
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,310
Speaker 0: And I know a lot of you are doing this.

513
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:46,910
Speaker 1: I know so many people doing this and they always tell me whenever I tell them not to is never share your password to anything with anyone ever, under any circumstances, to any person.

514
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,708
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

515
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,529
Speaker 0: But, Rim and Scott, I hear you thinking already.

516
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,591
Speaker 1: Yeah.

517
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:55,090
Speaker 1: So, but Rim and Scott, number one, I trust this person.

518
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:00,389
Speaker 1: They're like my wife or my husband or my mom or this person who's so incredibly close to me.

519
00:26:00,957 --> 00:26:01,110
Speaker 0: Bosco.

520
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:01,731
Speaker 1: Right.

521
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:04,930
Speaker 1: That I trust them with like everything else in my life.

522
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:07,870
Speaker 1: Even like my credit card, my ATM card and my PIN number.

523
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:09,469
Speaker 1: Why did you tell them your PIN number?

524
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,310
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

525
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,450
Speaker 0: Why did you tell them your PIN number?

526
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:14,430
Speaker 1: Emily, do you know any Rims passwords?

527
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:16,328
Speaker 1: No, she said no.

528
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:22,450
Speaker 0: Emily knows one of my passwords temporarily because it's a bullshit password that was used for a specific purpose and is going away actually.

529
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:23,014
Speaker 1: Right.

530
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:23,468
Speaker 1: There you go.

531
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:32,970
Speaker 0: It was, it was a, there was a, so yeah, one of the butt Rim and Scott's is there might be a system that you interact with that does not have multiple account capabilities.

532
00:26:34,253 --> 00:26:34,802
Speaker 0: Old shit.

533
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:35,290
Speaker 0: One.

534
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:35,531
Speaker 0: Right.

535
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:40,190
Speaker 1: Like if you have a Windows computer, you can just make user accounts for all the different people that are going to use it.

536
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:40,689
Speaker 0: In the old days.

537
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,670
Speaker 1: And now no one needs to tell anyone the other person's passwords because you log in as you.

538
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,089
Speaker 0: But in the old days you couldn't do that.

539
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,427
Speaker 1: Like yeah, you had a Windows 3.1 computer didn't even have a password, but maybe you had a Windows 95 computer.

540
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:51,531
Speaker 1: Okay.

541
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:57,786
Speaker 1: So now you have a password to log in or unlock a Windows 95 computer, but there's only one.

542
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,470
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know.

543
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:07,450
Speaker 0: That's why, uh, in the nineties, every kid who knew how to use the internet knew every website their parents ever visited, but not the other way around.

544
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:14,222
Speaker 1: So when you have a situation like that, you basically sort of have to follow the same rule.

545
00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:22,370
Speaker 1: Don't tell anyone your password, but you know, the, your is multiple people and you literally just don't tell anyone else who's not one of the use.

546
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:22,571
Speaker 0: Yeah.

547
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:23,569
Speaker 0: It's gotta be a need to know.

548
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:28,829
Speaker 1: If a friend comes over to and needs to use that Windows 3.1 computer, you unlock it for him.

549
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:30,508
Speaker 1: You don't tell him what it is.

550
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,570
Speaker 0: And of course the right answer is that system, whatever it is, is deprecated.

551
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,770
Speaker 0: You should assume that you're going to replace it when feasible.

552
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,170
Speaker 0: Now you might not be able to quickly because it's a thing that doesn't really exist anymore.

553
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:48,950
Speaker 0: Like, but, uh, you should at least bear in the back of your mind, like keep an eye out for a way to replace that thing with something that has user accounts.

554
00:27:49,931 --> 00:27:55,450
Speaker 0: Also, number two, but rim and Scott, this thing doesn't have shared accounts or doesn't have account systems.

555
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:57,116
Speaker 0: You're probably wrong.

556
00:27:57,136 --> 00:28:00,690
Speaker 0: A lot of things have ways to have multiple users that you don't realize.

557
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,314
Speaker 0: Yep.

558
00:28:01,335 --> 00:28:01,950
Speaker 0: Like Twitter.

559
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:11,850
Speaker 0: If you have a corporate Twitter account, you should set up tweet deck and then use other Twitter accounts for everyone to individually manage the group or the company Twitter.

560
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:17,570
Speaker 0: You're everyone in your company shouldn't all know the password to the Twitter account and log into it directly.

561
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:18,366
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

562
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:26,390
Speaker 0: But the reason I brought this up as a thing is that the most recent instance where this has come up is a problem you might not have thought about.

563
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:31,490
Speaker 0: I'm going to read the summary from the slash shot article that will tell you where we're going with.

564
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,950
Speaker 1: Well, I do want to talk about one more thing.

565
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:33,952
Speaker 1: Yeah.

566
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:39,150
Speaker 1: Is that you'll see on the news a lot or people a lot will say, you know, my account was hacked.

567
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:45,550
Speaker 1: My account was compromised account stolen, you know, like I lost my Warcraft account or someone stole my right.

568
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:46,653
Speaker 1: And you know what?

569
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:47,937
Speaker 1: Ninety nine point.

570
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:51,890
Speaker 1: ninety nine percent of the time they're using the word hacked, compromised, whatever.

571
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:58,250
Speaker 1: The truth is there's no way to like figure out someone's Facebook password and steal their account.

572
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,719
Speaker 1: Facebook is so friggin secure.

573
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:01,250
Speaker 0: They told that password to someone.

574
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:01,751
Speaker 0: Yeah.

575
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:06,430
Speaker 1: Somebody guessed the password because it was really shitty or they told it to someone.

576
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,574
Speaker 1: Ninety nine point.

577
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:09,990
Speaker 1: nine nine nine percent of the time it was ninety nine percent.

578
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,930
Speaker 0: The other one percent is you installed malware.

579
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:13,496
Speaker 1: That's also possible.

580
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:14,400
Speaker 1: But that's base.

581
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,363
Speaker 1: You know, it's still.

582
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:17,090
Speaker 1: you told the password to someone.

583
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:21,770
Speaker 1: They guessed your password or they had a malware that key logs you and got your password.

584
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,145
Speaker 0: Or you didn't hack into Facebook.

585
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:24,910
Speaker 1: Right.

586
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:30,530
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's not like I can go on to Facebook and pick an arbitrary person and log in as them somehow by hacking.

587
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:37,870
Speaker 1: That's not a thing you can do with any, you know, easy method that anyone like maybe the NSA can do it.

588
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,780
Speaker 1: It would be difficult for them.

589
00:29:41,302 --> 00:29:43,350
Speaker 1: Someone who worked at Facebook can do it as an inside job.

590
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,782
Speaker 0: So there's a court case.

591
00:29:44,904 --> 00:29:45,229
Speaker 0: This is a.

592
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,449
Speaker 1: So if you think it doesn't happen.

593
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,630
Speaker 0: This is a summary on Slashdot by Schwitt one of an article on the Washington Post.

594
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,003
Speaker 1: Such a trustworthy story.

595
00:29:54,023 --> 00:29:54,529
Speaker 1: Schwitt one.

596
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:54,971
Speaker 0: Yeah.

597
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:55,898
Speaker 1: On Slashdot.

598
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:56,341
Speaker 1: Whoa.

599
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:57,388
Speaker 1: This is like, whoa.

600
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,070
Speaker 0: But as I read this out loud, you'll start to realize where I'm going with this quote.

601
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,996
Speaker 0: And I'm giving proper attribution here.

602
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,390
Speaker 0: on Monday, the Ninth Circuit Court in the United States.

603
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,013
Speaker 1: The best court.

604
00:30:07,193 --> 00:30:10,990
Speaker 0: We'll hear arguments in United States versus Nosal on an interesting note.

605
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,068
Speaker 1: Who the hell is Nosal?

606
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,850
Speaker 0: We'll have to find out if a person shares access to a computer account with someone else.

607
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:24,350
Speaker 0: Under what circumstances can the second person engage in unauthorized access under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act?

608
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:27,349
Speaker 1: I don't know what that act says, except that it's a bullshit act.

609
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,014
Speaker 0: The case.

610
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:29,590
Speaker 1: But I can tell you what it should say.

611
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:33,750
Speaker 0: The case centers around the difference between having access to something and having permission to use it.

612
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:45,450
Speaker 0: In other words, if you give somebody a desktop password to your computer so they can watch Netflix, which is already logged in, but they take advantage of that to read all your email, how does the law look at that?

613
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:53,710
Speaker 0: What happens is they come back later, log in again without your immediate explicit permission, but only watch Netflix, which you gave them permission for before.

614
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:58,550
Speaker 0: What happens if you give them your Netflix password so they can watch it at your house, but not the desktop password?

615
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,670
Speaker 0: They go home and use that on their desktop to watch Netflix at their house.

616
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:08,503
Speaker 0: Eugene Volko has a paper coming articulating "the legal interpretations of computer trespass".

617
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:11,049
Speaker 0: and the gist of all this is...

618
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,970
Speaker 1: The current law is probably not addressing any of these issues and they're probably all fucked up.

619
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,439
Speaker 0: You open yourself up.

620
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:17,970
Speaker 0: I'm not a lawyer, this is not legal advice.

621
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:29,658
Speaker 0: You open yourself up, in my non-lawyer opinion, to insane liability that no one can really explain to you because it's not well understood.

622
00:31:29,718 --> 00:31:32,070
Speaker 0: yet if you ever give anyone your password.

623
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:38,129
Speaker 0: I mean, if I loan Scott my car and he's drunk and he kills someone with it...

624
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,008
Speaker 1: The law covers that.

625
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the law will deal with that.

626
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:45,290
Speaker 0: But don't loan your car to someone that you see is visibly intoxicated or you're fucked.

627
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,410
Speaker 1: But in the early days of drunk driving law, the law really didn't cover that very well.

628
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:57,569
Speaker 0: So if I loan my password to Joy Jojo Shabadoo and then Joy Jojo Shabadoo gives material support to Daesh terrorists using my account...

629
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:00,930
Speaker 1: You also gave material support, didn't you?

630
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:01,998
Speaker 0: Could I get in trouble?

631
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,643
Speaker 0: Maybe.

632
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:03,329
Speaker 0: You don't know.

633
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,089
Speaker 1: So don't even risk that shit.

634
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:15,462
Speaker 0: And even if you think... Say someone else does something legal but against the terms of service of a website by accident... Even if you gave them that permission, who's responsible?

635
00:32:15,522 --> 00:32:16,386
Speaker 0: How much trouble could you get?

636
00:32:16,707 --> 00:32:17,330
Speaker 0: No one knows.

637
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:21,650
Speaker 0: And in fact, it's even worse because the courts are fucking this up and hurting people already.

638
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:31,070
Speaker 0: So if you give a password to anything, to anyone, no one knows how much trouble you or that anyone could get into.

639
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not just things like that.

640
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:43,830
Speaker 1: Let's say you live with your friend and you don't have a lot of money and you like to play out of Hearthstone.

641
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,822
Speaker 1: So you don't really want to play against each other.

642
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:48,926
Speaker 1: so you don't have two accounts.

643
00:32:50,131 --> 00:32:50,954
Speaker 0: My brother and I did that.

644
00:32:50,974 --> 00:32:52,700
Speaker 0: There's an MMO, The Realm.

645
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,430
Speaker 0: We actually just used the same account and we each made two of the characters.

646
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,011
Speaker 1: Right.

647
00:32:56,111 --> 00:32:57,757
Speaker 1: And that way, you save a lot of money.

648
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,050
Speaker 1: You buy a card, well now you both have the card because you're sharing the same account.

649
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,326
Speaker 1: Yeah.

650
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,031
Speaker 1: It's like,

651
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:02,996
Speaker 1: "Whoa."

652
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:04,523
Speaker 1: Rather than like, "Oh, I have Dr.

653
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:05,307
Speaker 1: Boom and you don't.

654
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:05,649
Speaker 1: Ha ha

655
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:05,830
Speaker 1: ha.".

656
00:33:06,691 --> 00:33:08,319
Speaker 1: You're all just using the same account.

657
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,390
Speaker 1: You can't play against each other but that's fine.

658
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:12,313
Speaker 1: And you're all good.

659
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:14,562
Speaker 1: And you're just sharing the Battle.net login.

660
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:16,490
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're sharing this Battle.net login.

661
00:33:17,152 --> 00:33:23,090
Speaker 1: And then your friend maybe gets drunk or maybe he's a jerk or who knows, goes and just starts harassing some people on the Hearthstone.

662
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,025
Speaker 1: Like he sends a friend request and then he tells the person like, "Fuck you.

663
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:26,467
Speaker 1: Fuck, fuck,

664
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:26,910
Speaker 1: fuck.".

665
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,919
Speaker 1: And then that person reports him and now your account gets banned.

666
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:33,250
Speaker 1: And oops, why did you share an account with somebody?

667
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:33,890
Speaker 1: Right.

668
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:41,830
Speaker 1: And also, you think of that, you're sort of like trying to, you know, all these situations, it's like you're really just trying to steal Hearthstone cards effectively.

669
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,413
Speaker 1: The same way as sharing Netflix passwords.

670
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:45,637
Speaker 1: It's like, "Yo, you're trying to avoid paying for Netflix twice.

671
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,280
Speaker 1: You're trying to avoid paying for Hearthstone cards twice.

672
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,065
Speaker 1: You're trying to avoid paying for things you're supposed to be paying for.

673
00:33:50,385 --> 00:33:52,068
Speaker 1: So you kind of deserve, right?

674
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:52,810
Speaker 1: You shouldn't be doing

675
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:52,910
Speaker 1: that.".

676
00:33:53,790 --> 00:34:00,067
Speaker 0: Of course, part of the reason this has come up lately is that a lot of services like Netflix and everything, they knew you were sharing passwords forever.

677
00:34:00,148 --> 00:34:00,950
Speaker 0: They always knew that.

678
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:01,303
Speaker 0: Yeah.

679
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:06,643
Speaker 0: And as time has gone on, they're using that information to monetize their platforms better.

680
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,449
Speaker 0: So stay tuned for how they use that information in the future.

681
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,031
Speaker 0: Because guess what?

682
00:34:10,471 --> 00:34:11,212
Speaker 0: You gave it to them.

683
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:16,980
Speaker 0: They know, "Oh, these are the five IP addresses that Joey JoJo logs in from all the time.

684
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:24,609
Speaker 0: Based on those infinite magic cookies that we know about from privacy tracking stuff, we now know who all of Joey JoJo's friends

685
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:24,850
Speaker 0: are.".

686
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:26,672
Speaker 0: Interesting.

687
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:30,770
Speaker 0: And we got that information basically legally because he logged in, like he already signed up for the service.

688
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:36,427
Speaker 1: Your computer told us this information with software that you put on the computer and said, "Yes, software, do

689
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:36,648
Speaker 1: this.".

690
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:37,409
Speaker 1: And it did it.

691
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,632
Speaker 0: Now, there's also a technological reason.

692
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:43,235
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're a corporate user, obviously you know the reasons for this.

693
00:34:44,056 --> 00:34:45,536
Speaker 0: You want everyone to have their own accounts.

694
00:34:45,597 --> 00:35:00,430
Speaker 0: so when someone fucks up or something, then there's an audit trail and you can go to the police or the regulator or the auditor and be like, "Rim logged into the system at 4.51.21 at 8 milliseconds and made this change and this other thing happen

695
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:00,570
Speaker 0: later.".

696
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,452
Speaker 0: Or like shell history.

697
00:35:02,832 --> 00:35:07,537
Speaker 0: If you all share the same shell, a bunch of stuff is in the history now.

698
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,003
Speaker 0: Usually, I like to have a consistent shell.

699
00:35:12,383 --> 00:35:18,230
Speaker 0: As in, if I hit up when I log into my system, whatever's there is whatever I did last.

700
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,447
Speaker 1: Imagine if someone else did a bunch of stuff and you press up and you're like, "What's

701
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:21,669
Speaker 1: this?".

702
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,034
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's all this business?

703
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:24,780
Speaker 0: Now, what if my history's gone?

704
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,750
Speaker 0: What if I ran a command and I forgot and I needed to find it but he ran my history out?

705
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,543
Speaker 1: I got these files in my documents folder.

706
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:30,429
Speaker 1: Someone moved them on me.

707
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:31,551
Speaker 0: Yeah.

708
00:35:32,152 --> 00:35:33,715
Speaker 0: And those things can happen by accident.

709
00:35:34,737 --> 00:35:38,984
Speaker 0: Even if you trust someone 100%, it's still good for you each to have separate accounts.

710
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:42,590
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter that someone can still get material access.

711
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,019
Speaker 0: For example, Emily and I have separate accounts on our NAS.

712
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:48,065
Speaker 0: I'm the administrator.

713
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:49,690
Speaker 0: I could just go get those files.

714
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,294
Speaker 1: Also, you have physical access to the NAS.

715
00:35:52,314 --> 00:35:54,919
Speaker 1: There's a way to probably stick a pin in it to reset it.

716
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:00,590
Speaker 1: You can just pull it out of the wall, plug it into your own computer and do anything to it.

717
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,678
Speaker 1: Even though Emily's not the administrator, or maybe she is, I don't know.

718
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:07,007
Speaker 1: I could come and I could grab the NAS, take it home with me and get all the files.

719
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:07,890
Speaker 1: Nothing you could do about it.

720
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:14,402
Speaker 0: Scott and I both use our frontrowcrew.com email addresses, like a Gmail thing.

721
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,384
Speaker 0: A bunch of our friends use it too.

722
00:36:15,844 --> 00:36:17,287
Speaker 0: Scott is the administrator of that.

723
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:18,930
Speaker 0: Scott could go get my emails.

724
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:22,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could just reset RIM's email password, log in as RIM and read all his email.

725
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:37,730
Speaker 0: I trust him, but the difference is if we use one Gmail account with the same password, that is a way different situation from legal, ethical, auditing, and technological concerns than it is if I have my account, Scott has his account.

726
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,556
Speaker 0: Separately, there's the role of the administrator.

727
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,280
Speaker 0: that happens to be fulfilled by Scott.

728
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,365
Speaker 0: that has other meta capabilities.

729
00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:46,470
Speaker 0: It's not necessarily that he can get access.

730
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,933
Speaker 1: A lot of these legal questions are totally different, right?

731
00:36:48,993 --> 00:37:00,190
Speaker 1: If we are sharing a password and I send an email, then the legal question is a lot different than, "Oh, you're the administrator and you logged into RIM's account and sent an email by resetting his password without asking

732
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:00,410
Speaker 1: him.".

733
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,471
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

734
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:02,573
Speaker 1: It's totally different.

735
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:14,310
Speaker 0: It protects you and it protects the people around you to have well-defined roles of interaction in electronic systems independent of the material security underlying those systems.

736
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:16,592
Speaker 0: That's it.

737
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,838
Speaker 0: That's the entire point of this episode.

738
00:37:18,918 --> 00:37:21,866
Speaker 1: Also, when a password, it has to be remembered by more people.

739
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:23,210
Speaker 0: It's going to be a shittier password.

740
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:28,257
Speaker 1: It generally has to be shittier or easier to guess because it's something that more people can memorize.

741
00:37:28,277 --> 00:37:37,590
Speaker 1: If there's something that's unique to you, it's usually easier for you to memorize it or you can use something like a password card or whatever or some sort of other password-y system.

742
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,392
Speaker 0: I'll be honest.

743
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:43,370
Speaker 0: There are a tiny number of shared passwords Scott and I have for various reasons.

744
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:43,989
Speaker 1: There is one.

745
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:45,794
Speaker 0: A tiny number.

746
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:46,416
Speaker 0: There is one.

747
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:49,884
Speaker 0: It's not the best password, but we'll both remember it.

748
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:52,690
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone else in the world will ever know that password.

749
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,709
Speaker 1: If someone gets the password, big deal.

750
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,170
Speaker 0: If someone gets, at this point, that password doesn't actually have access to much anymore.

751
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,179
Speaker 0: You know what you could have done with that password?

752
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,970
Speaker 0: You could have hacked our wireless router.

753
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,641
Speaker 1: It's not even something we both need access to.

754
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,230
Speaker 1: I could just change it on you and it wouldn't matter.

755
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:08,871
Speaker 1: Exactly.

756
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:11,135
Speaker 0: Think of it that way.

757
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:19,090
Speaker 0: A lot of regulation in the finance world and in business around who has access to what, it's not about material access.

758
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:25,559
Speaker 0: When I worked at a broker-dealer, I could give myself root credentials on the production trading systems.

759
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,662
Speaker 0: I could know anything.

760
00:38:27,782 --> 00:38:29,345
Speaker 0: I could do select queries against the database.

761
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:32,830
Speaker 0: I could just get raw access to the database's underlying files.

762
00:38:33,452 --> 00:38:39,410
Speaker 0: But I had to log in through an audited system so people knew when and how I was accessing the system.

763
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:47,830
Speaker 0: So if I log in through the front end, I only get access to the data that my role as whatever it is I'm doing is supposed to get access to.

764
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:55,330
Speaker 0: Independently, I have a role as administrator where I have more access, but those two levels of access are controlled separately and the regulation is around that.

765
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,477
Speaker 0: A lot of regulations are around.

766
00:38:57,899 --> 00:39:00,490
Speaker 0: certain kinds of roles cannot be shared by the same person.

767
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:05,982
Speaker 0: So if I were a trader, I could not also be an administrator.

768
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:09,110
Speaker 0: If I was a trader, I probably shouldn't have access to anything.

769
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:21,430
Speaker 0: So think about that the next time your Facebook friend from out of town crashing on your couch wants to log into your HTPC and then your Amazon account to watch Netflix.

770
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:29,430
Speaker 1: Another big issue is that even if you're just not sharing your passwords with anyone, it's still having just a password is a problem these days.

771
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,890
Speaker 1: You really need two factor authentication to be safe.

772
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:32,875
Speaker 0: A lot of things support.

773
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,003
Speaker 0: Google just supports it.

774
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:34,870
Speaker 0: Gmail just supports it.

775
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,130
Speaker 1: Almost everything you use probably supports two factor authentication, right?

776
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:46,950
Speaker 1: Even, you know, Yahoo's doing something and every almost everything I use like Tumblr even was like send you a text with a number that you can use every time you log in.

777
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,919
Speaker 0: It is trivial to set up.

778
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:50,250
Speaker 0: At least use it for your email.

779
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,330
Speaker 0: Because as we've talked about, if someone compromises your email, they can reset everything you've got.

780
00:39:55,551 --> 00:40:02,950
Speaker 1: Actually, if you have two factor authentication, they might not be able to if true because they might need to like generate a code or have the piece of paper with codes on it.

781
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,235
Speaker 1: The backup codes.

782
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:05,081
Speaker 0: Yeah.

783
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:06,550
Speaker 1: To reset the password on something.

784
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,094
Speaker 0: And I think we've done shows on two factor.

785
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:13,730
Speaker 0: I mean, I could tell you that the current two factor number of my email account, you would have six seconds to crack my actual password.

786
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,274
Speaker 1: Right.

787
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:19,890
Speaker 1: But yeah, two factor authentication is like essential for anything you care about being secure.

788
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:25,150
Speaker 1: So anything you have, even though it's a pain in the ass, it's totally worth it to enable two factor authentication.

789
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:34,410
Speaker 1: So it's not just something, you know, a password, it's something you have and something, you know, like a phone or a little USB stick or something on anything you can just because why not?

790
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:34,952
Speaker 1: It's free.

791
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:36,157
Speaker 1: It's not like they charge you for this.

792
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:36,639
Speaker 1: And it just.

793
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,030
Speaker 1: you're never going to get screwed over if you do it.

794
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:46,510
Speaker 1: But if you want to have multiple people sharing, you can't be doing two factor because only one person can have the thing you have.

795
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:46,770
Speaker 1: Yeah.

796
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,114
Speaker 0: It's an intrinsic token.

797
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,358
Speaker 0: You can't copy that token.

798
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:49,638
Speaker 0: Yeah.

799
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,461
Speaker 1: It's a physical thing.

800
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:53,750
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you can copy a key to a house and they both have keys.

801
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,694
Speaker 0: You can't copy an RSA dongle.

802
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,396
Speaker 1: Right.

803
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:59,844
Speaker 0: So maybe barring again like that show we did on security.

804
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:00,365
Speaker 0: Yes.

805
00:41:00,485 --> 00:41:02,630
Speaker 0: NSA spy nonsense might be able to get around this.

806
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,031
Speaker 1: Who knows?

807
00:41:03,051 --> 00:41:03,553
Speaker 1: But yeah, you can.

808
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:04,638
Speaker 1: There's one anywhere.

809
00:41:04,658 --> 00:41:04,999
Speaker 1: Period.

810
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:05,401
Speaker 1: That's it.

811
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:07,429
Speaker 1: So you either have it or you don't.

812
00:41:08,371 --> 00:41:12,370
Speaker 1: So if you want two factor authentication, you can't share a password with someone.

813
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:20,150
Speaker 1: So if you're sharing passwords and doing the thing we tell you not to do, then you're going to not enable two factor because you don't want to ruin your password sharing system.

814
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:26,087
Speaker 1: So don't share the password in the first place and enable the two factor and you're all set.

815
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:26,168
Speaker 1: Yep.

816
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,186
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

817
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:40,220
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.
