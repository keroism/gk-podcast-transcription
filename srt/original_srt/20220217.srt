1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:07,800
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,398
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, February 17th, 2022.

3
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:09,719
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:13,289
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,694
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:19,270
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are talking about, for the second time, The Tale of Genji.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,258
Speaker 1: I'm sure we might reference it off and on in the future.

8
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,969
Speaker 1: It's part of the lexicon of things I've read that I have thoughts on.

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,750
Speaker 1: But if you missed it, you know, The Tale of Genji was the Geek Nights book club.

10
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,261
Speaker 1: We talked at length about why it took so long to read it.

11
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,007
Speaker 1: It wasn't just because we were slow.

12
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,070
Speaker 1: There was a lot of other things going on.

13
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:38,954
Speaker 0: We spent on this one book.

14
00:00:39,214 --> 00:00:46,970
Speaker 0: Now, in the past two months, I've read 1.9 books that aren't The Tale of Genji.

15
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:55,910
Speaker 1: But we already did an episode talking about the plot, the story, Genji himself, like our reactions to it just as a novel.

16
00:00:56,531 --> 00:01:12,670
Speaker 1: And because that took over an hour and we spent two years in this liminal space of not reading The Tale of Genji, and many of you have read it, at least I hope you have, there are only two people watching this live stream so I can see the relative interest in the second Genji episode compared to other topics.

17
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:14,477
Speaker 0: But that's fine.

18
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:15,321
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine.

19
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,250
Speaker 0: I'm going to spend two and a half years reading a book.

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,189
Speaker 1: You're going to spend two and a half years hearing about it.

21
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:22,129
Speaker 0: I'm going to spend two podcasts talking about it at least.

22
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:31,530
Speaker 1: But this episode is a combination of all the things we wanted to say that we couldn't get out because, you know, we talked for over an hour in episode one.

23
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:32,772
Speaker 1: We were tired and hungry.

24
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:42,109
Speaker 1: But two, the meta, like the things around the book that aren't just the story itself because we had an hour of just...

25
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:55,750
Speaker 0: Because if this hadn't been the first novel written a long ass time ago in Japan, and if this, you know, if a book like this was written just a couple hundred years ago, right?

26
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:58,190
Speaker 1: Kind of trashy romance story.

27
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:01,957
Speaker 0: And there was some other novel that was the first novel.

28
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:09,070
Speaker 0: This book would be, you know, not studied by scholars, not remembered, not, you know, significant really.

29
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:18,670
Speaker 1: Well, the end of the book even mentions other works that are referenced or mentioned in The Tale of Genji that are real close to being novels but don't quite make it.

30
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:20,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not sure.

31
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:23,828
Speaker 0: I tried to research what counts as a novel and basically it just...

32
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,590
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to find a community of people who have different opinions on what that means?

33
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,311
Speaker 0: Sure.

34
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:47,750
Speaker 0: It's like there isn't actually a complete agreement that this is the first novel, but, you know, I didn't really see any... It's like there was an agreement that I couldn't find people saying that this is definitely the first novel 100%, but I didn't see anyone referring to anything else as a potential first novel, right?

35
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:50,537
Speaker 0: It's like the only nominee.

36
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:55,870
Speaker 0: It doesn't get a unanimous vote, but there aren't any other nominees, so that's why it's the first novel.

37
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,111
Speaker 1: Novel.

38
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,790
Speaker 1: A fictitious prose narrative of book length typically...

39
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,110
Speaker 0: Is that what Wikipedia says?

40
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,949
Speaker 1: That's just the dictionary definition from Oxford Languages, it looks like.

41
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:05,870
Speaker 0: Okay.

42
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:14,010
Speaker 1: A fictitious prose narrative of book length typically representing character and action with some degree of realism.

43
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:16,707
Speaker 0: Some degree of...okay.

44
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:22,049
Speaker 1: Comes from Italian, French, Latin, Latin, Latin, Novus.

45
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,291
Speaker 0: Sure.

46
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,730
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know, it's like anything older than this...

47
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,390
Speaker 1: Which means new, a sense of novelty.

48
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:30,590
Speaker 0: Right.

49
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:42,290
Speaker 0: So anything older than this is going to be like, you know, not in, you know, a long prose form, like a poem is not a long prose form, right?

50
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:48,350
Speaker 1: Or it's a long form that involves prose, but comes from a non-written literary tradition.

51
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:48,930
Speaker 1: Right.

52
00:03:48,950 --> 00:04:02,590
Speaker 0: It could be a spoken tradition or a musical tradition or something, you know, some other sort of, you know, it's like, you know, a movie is not a novel, even though it's a long story about people.

53
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,930
Speaker 0: It's fictional, right?

54
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,300
Speaker 1: Yeah.

55
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,427
Speaker 0: Because it's not text, so it's like, you know, a short story is not a novel.

56
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,110
Speaker 0: Why it's too short?

57
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:20,589
Speaker 0: I don't know what the line is between...because there's some short novels out there, but especially...lines get really blurry because, like, you can have an adult short story, right?

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,687
Speaker 0: It's going to be longer than a kid's novel.

59
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:26,048
Speaker 0: But, you know, whatever.

60
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,430
Speaker 0: So yeah, we're going to talk about meta stuff, right?

61
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:36,830
Speaker 0: I think we should start, which is when I chose this book, you know, like I knew the book existed, but I didn't really know what it was about.

62
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,690
Speaker 0: I knew it was, like, a big historical deal, and I figured, you know, ah, this is one of those things that's referenced very often.

63
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,945
Speaker 1: Well, like, when we read The Odyssey, or, like, we both read a lot of old works.

64
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:49,390
Speaker 1: They're very fascinating to read.

65
00:04:50,050 --> 00:05:00,230
Speaker 0: Right, but it's, you know, I'm like, this is an old, significant, often referenced work, so therefore I should become knowledgeable about it so that when it's referenced, I get the reference.

66
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:08,410
Speaker 0: You know, I have a greater context and understanding of other works, right, even if I don't, you know, whether or not I enjoy this work or not, which I didn't know at the time.

67
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,773
Speaker 0: I keep hearing it come up.

68
00:05:11,014 --> 00:05:16,050
Speaker 0: If I hear anything, basically if I hear anything come up too often, well, there must be something to it, right?

69
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:34,070
Speaker 0: And then, you know, I think I said this before, there was an exhibit about the book at The Met, right, which I can just take the subway to in a few minutes, and I saw, I woke up one morning on a weekend, and I saw on Twitter, they're like, yeah, last weekend for the exhibit, and I was like, I'm not fucking doing anything.

70
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,999
Speaker 0: Just walk my ass over there, right?

71
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,530
Speaker 0: And at that exhibit, I learned many fascinating things that I will now discuss, right?

72
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:50,206
Speaker 0: So the first thing is that this book, when it was originally released, was released in separate books.

73
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,030
Speaker 0: It wasn't one giant book like we read.

74
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,032
Speaker 0: It was all.

75
00:05:53,072 --> 00:06:07,701
Speaker 0: these chapters were coming out, you know, chapter by, you know, in smaller sections, which really reminded me of when you go to a Japanese bookstore like Kinokuniya, and you see that the novels come out in, you know, chapter by chapter.

76
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:11,410
Speaker 0: I think one of our earlier Book Club books was Qteen Eighty-Four, right?

77
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:20,590
Speaker 0: And, you know, we read Qteen Eighty-Four, you know, by Murakami, author Murakami, not artist Murakami, as one giant book, right?

78
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:26,630
Speaker 0: But I think if you read Qteen Eighty-Four in Japan, I don't remember exactly how many, was it two or four?

79
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,789
Speaker 0: It was some, you know, number of smaller books that came out one at a time.

80
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:39,090
Speaker 1: And that's not unique to Japanese literature, like The Count of Monte Cristo was just a serial with like a little chapter revealed like every time.

81
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,383
Speaker 0: Well, that was like in, that was in a larger publication though, right?

82
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,030
Speaker 0: Like you would get like a magazine or something.

83
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,250
Speaker 1: It was basically the Shonen Jump of its time, like hey, here's a bunch of short stories.

84
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:50,057
Speaker 0: Of its time, I think.

85
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:55,430
Speaker 1: But, as a result, in its time, very few people read that as one big work.

86
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,289
Speaker 1: They would just read it like, oh yeah, The New Count of Monte Cristo was out in the thing, and I read it.

87
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:05,367
Speaker 1: But then when we read it as adults, we read it as this giant book that's like a thousand pages long.

88
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:06,350
Speaker 1: that took me a month to read.

89
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:08,029
Speaker 0: It was real good.

90
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:11,276
Speaker 0: So that goes back to what makes a novel.

91
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:18,410
Speaker 0: See, I had erroneously thought that something that makes a novel a novel is that it's a chapter book, right?

92
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,750
Speaker 0: That there are, you know, because a short story is not going to be, if you have two chapters, you can't be a short story, right?

93
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:25,535
Speaker 0: That just makes sense.

94
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,270
Speaker 0: So, you know, but if something's got chapters.

95
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,869
Speaker 1: I've read short stories that included a like chapter two.

96
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:33,908
Speaker 0: Maybe, but I, you know.

97
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,608
Speaker 0: But they were still short, like under 50 pages.

98
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:44,750
Speaker 0: My erroneous previous conception was that a novel is a novel, you know, one of the characteristics of a novel is chapters, right?

99
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,130
Speaker 0: Well, I guess that doesn't seem to be the case.

100
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,810
Speaker 1: Because the way I've thought about it, and this is not based on any academia, like this is just how I personally interact with novels.

101
00:07:54,471 --> 00:08:06,010
Speaker 1: I think of novels as when you've got a relatively consistent story that progresses over the course of the work, of sufficient length, with an intentional ending of some kind.

102
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:12,090
Speaker 1: Like that's kind of the broad area of how I've looked at novels in that I've read works older than the Tale of Genji.

103
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:25,230
Speaker 1: And other than the Odyssey, very few of them had a lot of that intention of like this story starts here and ends here with a consistent cast-ish of characters at a relative progression of the plot.

104
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:37,429
Speaker 1: And while many epic poems have that and do have an intentional ending, like we know how the Odyssey ends, it has a very, like it wraps everything up very neatly, but because it's an epic poem, I always did treat it differently.

105
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:38,851
Speaker 0: Yeah.

106
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:46,490
Speaker 0: So anyway, so, you know, the fact that it came out as these separate books, and actually at the exhibit we saw, like, you know, not the earliest.

107
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,835
Speaker 1: Oh, none of those exist.

108
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:51,330
Speaker 1: All the originals are lost to time, with no exception.

109
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,931
Speaker 0: Right.

110
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:56,077
Speaker 0: These weren't originals, like, touched by the author, right?

111
00:08:56,297 --> 00:09:05,150
Speaker 0: But these were, you know, extremely old published editions that, you know, noble people had back hundreds of years ago.

112
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:10,685
Speaker 0: And it was several, it was like, they had, like, it was like all these books lined up, right?

113
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,450
Speaker 0: Volume one, two, three, four.

114
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:18,906
Speaker 0: And I could imagine that, like, you know, at the time it was probably like this, you know, this woman would write a volume, right?

115
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:23,164
Speaker 0: And then I don't know how they would, you know, print it.

116
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:24,450
Speaker 0: Was it like woodblock or whatever?

117
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:33,370
Speaker 1: Oh, so it was, it's a specific style that was popular at the time, the Oriholm style, which is a little mini book, but it doesn't open like a normal book.

118
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,500
Speaker 1: It's basically, imagine one long piece of paper that's alternatingly folded like an accordion.

119
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,851
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

120
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:42,118
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like they would produce enough of those, right?

121
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:47,510
Speaker 0: And then they would get disseminated, probably, you know, by horse, I guess, is the fastest way, right?

122
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,136
Speaker 0: It's like amongst all the other nobles, right?

123
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:56,590
Speaker 0: And they'd be waiting for the next one the way that people today are waiting for, like, Netflix seasons to drop, right?

124
00:09:58,172 --> 00:10:01,260
Speaker 1: So get this, I'm looking at the Wikipedia about Oriholm because I don't know a lot about this.

125
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:05,090
Speaker 1: Obviously, if you want to know about the real history of The Tale of Genji, go read an expert's website.

126
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:12,810
Speaker 0: I'm not going to, you know, I'm trying to avoid doing the thing where we, like, read Wikipedia and then just reiterate it because you can do that yourself, right?

127
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,270
Speaker 0: I'm only going to talk about things that I'm aware of, you know, in my own brain.

128
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:29,430
Speaker 1: But I was skimming it just to see if there's anything interesting and it points out that this style basically became extremely popular in Japan largely because of The Tale of Genji.

129
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:40,867
Speaker 1: Like, it is noted as one of the earliest popular uses of it and one of the most popular books to appear in the history of the style was in the 12th century.

130
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,630
Speaker 1: The Tale of Genji got more and more popular.

131
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:57,430
Speaker 0: So yeah, so something else, right, so basically when I was at this exhibit, that was like one of the first things I noticed, right, was that sort of commonality that we had with these Japanese nobles from centuries ago, right?

132
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,902
Speaker 0: It's like there was a serial work that they were, you know, it's like how much leisure did they have?

133
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:06,610
Speaker 0: Well, in fact, The Tale of Genji gives us a lot of insight into their leisure.

134
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:10,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, case in point, ask an average person, what the fuck is Genji's job?

135
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

136
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,035
Speaker 0: It's like they didn't have any movies or video games.

137
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:20,263
Speaker 0: It's like they enjoyed life, you know, watching archery competitions, performing theater for each other, playing music with each other.

138
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:21,605
Speaker 0: They didn't have concerts to go to.

139
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:22,807
Speaker 0: There wasn't like rock stars.

140
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:25,310
Speaker 0: They played music, you know, for each other, right?

141
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:39,943
Speaker 0: You know, because it's not like they trained the peasants how to play music, you know, they played Go and other board games, you know, and they wrote poetry and had poetry competitions and art competitions.

142
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:46,930
Speaker 0: And, you know, these were the sorts of things they did for leisure, including reading The Tale of Genji and then talking about it.

143
00:11:48,671 --> 00:12:00,504
Speaker 0: And it was interesting to see at the exhibit because I not only did I see that, but so many of the things were other examples of things that we had in common with, you know, us of today.

144
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:01,025
Speaker 0: Right.

145
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:01,345
Speaker 0: Who?

146
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:05,150
Speaker 0: we don't consider ourselves to be nobles, but I guess relatively we are.

147
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:06,293
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.

148
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:12,710
Speaker 1: As we on our own dime, for the most part, are making a podcast for whoever happens to listen to it because we think it's fun.

149
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:13,851
Speaker 0: Right.

150
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:20,260
Speaker 0: You know, it's like how much we had in common with them, not only following serial artworks.

151
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:20,601
Speaker 0: Right.

152
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:24,787
Speaker 0: But I also saw there is like the poetry competitions.

153
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:26,890
Speaker 0: It's like all throughout Genji.

154
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,036
Speaker 0: People are communicating to each other with poetry in the poetry.

155
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:32,718
Speaker 0: They're dropping references to things.

156
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:36,083
Speaker 0: How often do we just like insert Simpsons references into whatever.

157
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:36,344
Speaker 0: Right.

158
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:40,750
Speaker 0: But if someone if I wrote some book with a Simpsons reference, like two knives.

159
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:41,451
Speaker 0: Right.

160
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,616
Speaker 0: And someone republishes that in five, six hundred years.

161
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:45,537
Speaker 1: They'll be a footnote.

162
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,541
Speaker 0: This is they got to put a footnote on that.

163
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:48,222
Speaker 0: Two knives.

164
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:53,490
Speaker 1: This is a reference to most his lack from a lost animated series we believe was called The Simpsons.

165
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,152
Speaker 0: Hopefully they have a cyberspace.

166
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:57,656
Speaker 0: They could just insert the clip of Mo going two knives.

167
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:00,181
Speaker 0: But you know, you get the idea.

168
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:00,882
Speaker 0: The same thing.

169
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:05,730
Speaker 0: They're constantly dropping references to Chinese poetry and shit in The Tale of Genji.

170
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:16,786
Speaker 1: Well, to the point, there's one chapter that I even it's one chapter I actually kind of glossed over because the chapter was like dense and I didn't really understand what was going on.

171
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:17,527
Speaker 1: We got to the end of it.

172
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:19,150
Speaker 1: I went back and looked at the footnotes.

173
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:32,670
Speaker 1: It was very clear that chapter was like unique among all the chapters of The Tale of Genji and that it was almost nothing but references to popular Chinese literature that readers of The Tale of Genji in its context and time would have recognized.

174
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:40,205
Speaker 1: So that is like us stumbling into like a bunch of people are really into, I don't know, Twilight fandom.

175
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,970
Speaker 1: And we have no idea what the fuck they're talking about.

176
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,471
Speaker 0: Yeah.

177
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,172
Speaker 0: So the other.

178
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,295
Speaker 0: so it goes even further.

179
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:47,836
Speaker 0: Right.

180
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:56,850
Speaker 0: So this poetry nonsense, I got the feeling that it was a lot like today where you see like a sports anime come out and that sport gets popular.

181
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,232
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

182
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:00,073
Speaker 0: Chicken and egg.

183
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:00,994
Speaker 0: What came first?

184
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:08,465
Speaker 0: But there were a lot of things that that exhibit about poetry competitions and people flinging poetry at each other.

185
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:12,010
Speaker 0: And it was clear that like that's something that they were doing.

186
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:21,765
Speaker 0: And I don't know if it was, you know, The Tale of Genji like got people interested in flinging poetry at each other or they already were.

187
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:24,930
Speaker 0: And it sort of made it more popular or, you know, right.

188
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,399
Speaker 1: Well, there's contemporary like current things that have like we've seen this happen where something is depicted in media.

189
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:32,961
Speaker 1: People get interested in it.

190
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:39,330
Speaker 1: Even though it was a thing, it becomes more popularized and more people make it a thing or start doing it.

191
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,377
Speaker 1: And it's like hackers did some of that with like hacking culture.

192
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:50,730
Speaker 1: But War Game really did that because that movie war dialing was extremely unknown and not common.

193
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:52,111
Speaker 1: I don't know.

194
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:56,539
Speaker 1: I want to even say that war dialing was not a agreed upon term before that movie.

195
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:03,370
Speaker 1: But after that movie, a million kids, including me, like got really into hacking and learned about it because of the movie.

196
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:10,463
Speaker 1: But then that fed into this mythos around hacking to where people didn't realize how popular that movie made it specifically.

197
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:14,430
Speaker 1: yet watched that movie and thought, oh, yeah, this is describing the hobby that I'm into.

198
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,395
Speaker 1: Like it's a it's definitely a feedback loop.

199
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,340
Speaker 1: And we've seen this time and time again.

200
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:22,129
Speaker 0: Now, this sort of becomes obvious once I mention it.

201
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:22,470
Speaker 0: Right.

202
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,693
Speaker 0: And this is this is the real.

203
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:24,655
Speaker 0: this is the bomb.

204
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:25,256
Speaker 0: Right.

205
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:26,940
Speaker 0: It's sort of common sense.

206
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,265
Speaker 0: But you go I was at the Met.

207
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:29,586
Speaker 0: It's an.

208
00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:30,869
Speaker 0: it's an art museum.

209
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,370
Speaker 0: Right.

210
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,715
Speaker 0: But they had an exhibit about a book.

211
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:35,358
Speaker 0: So what are they going to show there?

212
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:35,819
Speaker 0: It's like.

213
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,323
Speaker 0: it's not paintings.

214
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,926
Speaker 0: It's not sculptures.

215
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:39,908
Speaker 0: It's not right.

216
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:40,770
Speaker 0: It's just a book.

217
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:47,060
Speaker 0: So this is like what was in the exhibit volumes of books and then like text on the walls explaining it.

218
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,400
Speaker 0: Right.

219
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:53,430
Speaker 0: It's like, no, the exhibit, the vast majority of it was fucking fan art.

220
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,332
Speaker 1: Yeah.

221
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:59,322
Speaker 0: It was ancient people hundreds of years ago doing Genji fan art.

222
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:02,710
Speaker 0: They had screens that had Genji scenes painted on them.

223
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,673
Speaker 0: They had like these people read this fucking thing.

224
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:06,374
Speaker 0: Right.

225
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:16,666
Speaker 0: And they had all their artists make them Genji musical instruments, Genji, all Genji, any Genji fans, like anything that you could put art on.

226
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:20,670
Speaker 0: Genji scrolls, you know, Genji inkstone.

227
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:21,771
Speaker 0: Right.

228
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:22,793
Speaker 0: It's like these.

229
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,238
Speaker 0: get, you know, Genji is basically Genji merch.

230
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:25,779
Speaker 0: Right.

231
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:31,370
Speaker 1: It was like, you know, like the artist's alley of Genji merch, like, hey, check out this painting I made about Genji.

232
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:32,771
Speaker 0: Right.

233
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:41,919
Speaker 0: When Genji painted on the bamboo screen, like they had Genji T-shirts, there were Genji kimonos with like scenes of Genji in the in the fabric.

234
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:54,950
Speaker 1: It was all, you know, the pick up artists of the late Heian era were like trying to be Genji and were like writing poems and like writing them on a little fan and like trying to emulate what they read in that work.

235
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,611
Speaker 0: Right.

236
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:59,774
Speaker 0: The kids today with and there was also fanfics too.

237
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,275
Speaker 0: There was Genji fanfics too.

238
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:01,475
Speaker 0: Right.

239
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:06,398
Speaker 1: It's like there's even debate about some of the later chapters might have been collaborations or written by someone else.

240
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,362
Speaker 0: Like there was every all this shit that people are doing today.

241
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:11,041
Speaker 0: Right.

242
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,871
Speaker 0: That different.

243
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:25,333
Speaker 1: Look at Roman graffiti or look at OK.

244
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,134
Speaker 1: Like, OK, the word OK.

245
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:28,776
Speaker 1: Do you know the origin of that word?

246
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:38,883
Speaker 1: It's a meme from hundreds from a couple hundred years ago where people would make acronyms that were incorrect and spelled wrong because they thought it was funny.

247
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:44,868
Speaker 1: OK stands for all correct, spelled wrong with a K. And it was a meme from like the eighteen hundreds.

248
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,590
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's right or wrong, but OK.

249
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,350
Speaker 1: There was.

250
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:52,653
Speaker 1: I watched a documentary on this not that long ago, so it was fresh in my mind.

251
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:53,874
Speaker 1: But is it OK?

252
00:17:54,154 --> 00:18:02,260
Speaker 1: Memes like memes and pop culture references and like the idle leisure's of people who have the privilege to take idle leisure's.

253
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,621
Speaker 1: Not much has changed.

254
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:16,510
Speaker 1: And these old works only feel inaccessible because of the distance from that culture in the same way that even contemporary cultures are very inaccessible to people who don't know about the shibboleths and the details in the context of those cultures.

255
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:27,710
Speaker 1: And that stood out very profoundly in the tale of Genji, because it's the first work I've read in a long time that is from a culture I know very little about.

256
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:29,031
Speaker 0: I don't know much.

257
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:30,873
Speaker 0: I didn't know basically anything.

258
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:31,173
Speaker 0: Right.

259
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:39,180
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, my knowledge of, you know, what Japan was like, you know, hundreds of years ago is basically limited.

260
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:50,090
Speaker 0: You know, a very self-aware of this is basically viewed through the lens of fictional works like samurai movies, which obviously are no less than 100 years old.

261
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:52,193
Speaker 0: Right.

262
00:18:52,534 --> 00:19:00,189
Speaker 1: And like those movies are set in different eras of Japan from the Heian era that this is set in.

263
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,591
Speaker 0: Exactly.

264
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:07,298
Speaker 0: And that was even if there's any accuracy to them, you know, because it's sort of like.

265
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:17,010
Speaker 0: if someone wanted to get, you know, the history of like, you know, 20th century, you know, the US and was watching The Godfather.

266
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:19,016
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, how accurate is this?

267
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:21,704
Speaker 0: It's like that's what watching, you know, let me watch Seven Samurai.

268
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:23,249
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, well, yeah.

269
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:35,570
Speaker 0: But it was also Father was sort of somewhat at least closer to the time it was made closer to the time in which the events it portrays would have taken place.

270
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:40,220
Speaker 0: Whereas samurai movies were made hundreds of years after.

271
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,130
Speaker 0: Well, maybe not necessarily hundreds, depending on which era of Japan they were making the movie about.

272
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,970
Speaker 0: But quite many more decades between the movie and the of the events, the fictional events would have taken place.

273
00:19:52,250 --> 00:20:06,770
Speaker 1: But what is interesting is that it feels like the tale of Genji feels very true to many of the broad cultural strokes of that era, even though the specific events in this book are clearly fictionalized and exaggerated.

274
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,190
Speaker 0: Because this book, unlike Godfather, right?

275
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:15,883
Speaker 0: Seven Samurai, this book was made at the in the era of which it is portraying.

276
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,248
Speaker 0: Like if I wrote a book today about the 21st century.

277
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,201
Speaker 1: What if I wrote a book about like being a podcaster during this era?

278
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:27,024
Speaker 1: Like I work in a tech company.

279
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:28,307
Speaker 1: I got some money.

280
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:29,630
Speaker 1: This is how I spend my day.

281
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,969
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of chapters about Overwatch because I play it all the time.

282
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:43,290
Speaker 0: Also, right, is that we know we don't know their real name, but we know that the author was the daughter of like some regional governor.

283
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:43,991
Speaker 0: Right.

284
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:51,370
Speaker 0: You know, not like a not like, you know, hanging out with the emperor, but like, you know, a noble person, not a, you know, a peasant, right?

285
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:57,730
Speaker 0: Someone who obviously was literate, had access to paper and ink and, you know, all kinds of things.

286
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:06,110
Speaker 0: And this not only tells you about the time, but also about the perspective of a person in that position at that time.

287
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:11,125
Speaker 0: You know, you're seeing, you know, the world through that person's eyes.

288
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:12,430
Speaker 0: They can only write what they know.

289
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,111
Speaker 0: Right.

290
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:27,670
Speaker 0: And I talked about how, you know, that's I think my guess as to the reason why you don't see a lot of things written about, like what was going on with, you know, wars or politics or peasants or commerce.

291
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:32,208
Speaker 0: Because this person who wrote that wasn't engaging in those things and they didn't know about them.

292
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:32,770
Speaker 0: Right.

293
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,022
Speaker 0: They were hanging out, playing music, writing poetry, et cetera, et cetera.

294
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,246
Speaker 0: So, you know, having a romance.

295
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:39,530
Speaker 0: So that's what they wrote about.

296
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:51,350
Speaker 1: But also they wrote in a way which may be a reflection of the reality of the time, maybe a romanization of the reality of the time, or may have been a pointed avoidance of difficult topics.

297
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:53,519
Speaker 1: But this was published contemporarily.

298
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:55,949
Speaker 1: Like it wasn't like this was an insider account.

299
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, they wrote it and then nobles read it.

300
00:21:58,787 --> 00:21:59,230
Speaker 0: So they couldn't upset...

301
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,735
Speaker 1: See also, like Shakespeare.

302
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:04,206
Speaker 1: Shakespeare couldn't just be like, "Yes, this king in particular, fuck

303
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:04,467
Speaker 1: him.".

304
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:10,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, Shakespeare didn't go to the Globe Theater and be like, "Fuck the current king who's paying for

305
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:10,629
Speaker 0: this.".

306
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:15,949
Speaker 1: So he wrote a lot of stories like, "Oh yeah, that past king was no good because he's not in favor with the current

307
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:16,110
Speaker 1: royalty.".

308
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:26,150
Speaker 1: So it's hard for me, as someone who doesn't know much about Hay and Erra, to know how much of this might have been her avoiding these topics.

309
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:33,490
Speaker 1: But it seems like a lot of this writing was during a relatively stable and peaceful era of the Hay court.

310
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:46,270
Speaker 0: Except as the story goes on, it seems like, you know, and I noticed this pattern in lots and lots of fictional works of the greatest, you know, most prosperous, wonderful times.

311
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:48,675
Speaker 0: I guess there's people who feel this way too, right?

312
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:51,080
Speaker 0: Are always the oldest times.

313
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,210
Speaker 0: And in this book, it's actually interesting in that the prosperous times are actually the beginning of the book.

314
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:07,690
Speaker 1: It's the current times right up until Genji gets a little older and then it's the evil times where the government is getting more austere and there's political troubles that are never described specifically at any point.

315
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:09,652
Speaker 0: Right.

316
00:23:09,672 --> 00:23:19,948
Speaker 0: But something like Lord of the Rings, it's like things used to be fucking crazy good and then you're reading, but the story takes place in the third era or whatever, right?

317
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:21,230
Speaker 0: Or things are not as awesome.

318
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:28,159
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, King Arthur, it's like, okay, I guess King Arthur does get to the good times, but then the not so good, right?

319
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,764
Speaker 0: There's always, it's always a downslope.

320
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:35,550
Speaker 0: I very rarely read, I'm sure they exist.

321
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:36,514
Speaker 1: Culture.

322
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:38,990
Speaker 1: Every day forward in the future.

323
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:39,511
Speaker 1: Star Wars.

324
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:39,892
Speaker 1: Old Republic.

325
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:41,076
Speaker 0: Whoa, it's awesome.

326
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:42,540
Speaker 0: And then Star Wars, you know, down.

327
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,704
Speaker 0: It's just a downward slope.

328
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,710
Speaker 0: There's no, it doesn't go, it doesn't get great.

329
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,810
Speaker 1: Of course, arguably the later movies point out that the Old Republic sucked and had deep problems.

330
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,150
Speaker 0: Well, in some ways it sucked, but in some ways not.

331
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,315
Speaker 1: Well, look at the culture books.

332
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,550
Speaker 1: Literally every year that goes by, everything is better.

333
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,130
Speaker 0: Well, culture, I guess would be the exception.

334
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,510
Speaker 1: And the old times are terrible.

335
00:24:01,853 --> 00:24:03,690
Speaker 0: I guess, yeah, culture is the backwards one.

336
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:06,858
Speaker 1: A lot of optimistic sci-fi is like that.

337
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:10,930
Speaker 1: It's always like we've come out of a dark age and we're entering an enlightened age.

338
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:20,690
Speaker 1: But it's very telling that the Tale of Genji, and that's where I don't know how much of that was a reaction to maybe shifts in the author's life or things the author noticed.

339
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,717
Speaker 1: How much of it might have been just them just getting, them just getting old.

340
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:31,990
Speaker 0: because as people get old, right, you know, we see people just in our lives, you know, which are half over, right?

341
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,324
Speaker 0: Like conservative people are always like, ah, the old days, right?

342
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:36,510
Speaker 0: You know, the old days.

343
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:40,850
Speaker 1: I look at Counter-Strike 1.6 and I think, thank Satan, there is Counter-Strike Go.

344
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:51,330
Speaker 0: But I think there is a general, you know, wrong feeling of, ah, the great old, the good old days, right, amongst people, you know, all over the place.

345
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,130
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, some one culture that feels that way.

346
00:24:53,170 --> 00:25:15,450
Speaker 1: But another way to look at this, because I don't want to remove literary agency from the author because the story, everything feels great when Genji's young and doesn't have any responsibilities or problems or consequences, but then the story gets more melancholy and complex as Genji is an adult and has to deal with complications.

347
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:23,510
Speaker 1: So that also, it fits the story of Genji growing up and seeing the world from increasingly broader perspectives.

348
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:29,550
Speaker 0: So even if the world stays the same, right, getting older kind of sucks in so many ways.

349
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:36,270
Speaker 1: I just turned 40 and I got to tell you, 40 ain't 30 and 30 ain't 20 in terms of certain physical parts of my body.

350
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,197
Speaker 1: Look at you, left knee.

351
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,730
Speaker 1: You betrayed me for the last time.

352
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,110
Speaker 0: Especially people didn't live that long in this era.

353
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,751
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

354
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:46,021
Speaker 1: I mean, look at these emperors like, oh, no, he's 40.

355
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:47,507
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's going to die any day.

356
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,190
Speaker 1: Good Lord.

357
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:49,253
Speaker 0: Yep.

358
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,170
Speaker 0: Well, they didn't have medical science that we had, you know.

359
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:52,450
Speaker 0: Yeah.

360
00:25:53,953 --> 00:26:05,890
Speaker 1: But in terms of that meta too, it's interesting to see how radically differently, at least the translation we read, the book is structured differently as it goes on.

361
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,430
Speaker 1: Chapters are written differently and that's something we pointedly avoided talking about in the first half of the show.

362
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:21,290
Speaker 1: Pick any random chapter from After Genji Dies and it is just absolutely, I skimmed through one again before the show just to make sure I wasn't just, you know, those are the ones I read most recently.

363
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:22,774
Speaker 1: No, it's like night and day.

364
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:26,605
Speaker 1: The later chapters to a modern audience are just easier to read.

365
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:27,768
Speaker 1: Full stop.

366
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:28,530
Speaker 0: They have structure.

367
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,191
Speaker 1: I don't know.

368
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:31,215
Speaker 1: They tell you more about what's happening.

369
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:39,830
Speaker 1: A section will end and the next section just like either picks up where the last one left off or explains the setting change.

370
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,089
Speaker 1: Like now we're in this other place and here's what this person's up to.

371
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:53,730
Speaker 1: The first chapters were just like you'd have two characters talking and then suddenly two different characters are talking and you're not sure if they're in the same place or not and sometimes they aren't.

372
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,431
Speaker 0: I highlighted a part.

373
00:26:55,471 --> 00:27:08,870
Speaker 0: I looked through my Kindle for just the few parts that I highlighted when I was reading and there's literally a sentence in one of the middle chapters that's like, "Ah, yeah, you know, and the years went on such and

374
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,130
Speaker 0: such.".

375
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:19,449
Speaker 0: And it was just one sentence at the beginning of a paragraph and there's a footnote attached to that sentence and the footnote says, "This sentence covers a period of four

376
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:19,729
Speaker 0: years.".

377
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:28,180
Speaker 0: And also I think I did mention there's like a paragraph where it's like, "Oh, yeah, an emperor died.

378
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:30,124
Speaker 0: Another emperor took over and someone else

379
00:27:30,164 --> 00:27:30,645
Speaker 0: died.".

380
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:33,430
Speaker 0: And it was like that was in the middle of a paragraph.

381
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm back in like, "Wait, which emperor?

382
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,304
Speaker 1: The current emperor?

383
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:37,369
Speaker 1: Who's that emperor

384
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:37,550
Speaker 1: now?".

385
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,192
Speaker 0: Right.

386
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:47,590
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, when Murasaki, the author's character dies, that's a whole fucking chapter.

387
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:54,770
Speaker 0: It's all these different, you know, the time scales just keep getting out of whack.

388
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:59,830
Speaker 0: But after Genji dies, the rest of the book has sort of a steady pace of things.

389
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:00,132
Speaker 0: Right.

390
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:02,650
Speaker 0: It's like this happened and this happened and this happened.

391
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:03,131
Speaker 0: Right.

392
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:08,470
Speaker 0: It's not just an artifact of the translator doing something different for those chapters.

393
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,738
Speaker 0: It's like this.

394
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:11,268
Speaker 0: They really are.

395
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:17,286
Speaker 1: There is just there is more context as to where and there's fewer.

396
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:18,570
Speaker 0: there's fewer characters.

397
00:28:19,313 --> 00:28:19,614
Speaker 0: Right.

398
00:28:19,976 --> 00:28:22,330
Speaker 0: There's less moving all over the place.

399
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:22,812
Speaker 0: Right.

400
00:28:22,892 --> 00:28:25,240
Speaker 0: Things are happening always in chronological order.

401
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,090
Speaker 0: You don't have the overlapping stuff going on anymore.

402
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,170
Speaker 1: The characters are a little simpler to like the characters.

403
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,721
Speaker 0: The characters aren't changing their roles too much.

404
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:35,847
Speaker 0: You always know who's who.

405
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:36,972
Speaker 1: Yep.

406
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:38,879
Speaker 1: They're acting in character.

407
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:41,268
Speaker 0: They have these, you know, it's only dealing with one plot.

408
00:28:42,311 --> 00:28:48,670
Speaker 0: So it's like you can follow, you know, the characters pretty much have the same motivations and goals throughout the rest of the book.

409
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:57,850
Speaker 1: But like it really feels like the early chapters are very disconnected from each other in that they're almost like, let's have a story where Genji has this kind of affair.

410
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:58,534
Speaker 1: All right.

411
00:28:58,554 --> 00:28:59,769
Speaker 1: Let's have this kind of affair.

412
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:05,530
Speaker 1: And consequences are not like tied together or like they don't progress anything other than Genji's development.

413
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:07,436
Speaker 1: And they're very standalone.

414
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:21,549
Speaker 1: But also it almost reads like a, well, that's just what would have happened, which is a thing that a lot of in modern sensibilities like contemporary today, that's often the sign of a less apt writer like a George R.R.

415
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:21,790
Speaker 1: Martin.

416
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,814
Speaker 1: Like, I'm just going to.

417
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:24,965
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, that wasn't a good story.

418
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:25,930
Speaker 1: What just happened there?

419
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,661
Speaker 1: But that's logically what would happen.

420
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:28,990
Speaker 1: That's what that character would have done.

421
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:33,650
Speaker 0: I don't see the author as a not good author.

422
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:39,450
Speaker 0: I see the author as it's like if you just watch old Olympics and it's like you watch the high jump gold medalist.

423
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,710
Speaker 0: And it's like that was the highest jumper in the world at the time.

424
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:42,971
Speaker 0: Right.

425
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:45,950
Speaker 0: It's they couldn't jump very high compared to how we jump today.

426
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,362
Speaker 0: That's because it was 100 years ago.

427
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:48,945
Speaker 0: Right.

428
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:49,990
Speaker 0: They couldn't jump that high.

429
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,034
Speaker 0: Then they didn't know how.

430
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:51,979
Speaker 1: Watch a sitcom.

431
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:54,290
Speaker 0: Athletic training and all the things that we have.

432
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,855
Speaker 1: Watch a sitcom like one episode.

433
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:59,130
Speaker 0: This person didn't have Shakespeare to read.

434
00:29:59,730 --> 00:29:59,830
Speaker 0: Right.

435
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,130
Speaker 0: Shakespeare had other things to learn from, you know, and then other people had Shakespeare to learn from.

436
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:05,412
Speaker 0: Right.

437
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:07,810
Speaker 0: But, you know, Murasaki, Shakiba, what did they have?

438
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:08,192
Speaker 0: Right.

439
00:30:08,232 --> 00:30:11,109
Speaker 0: They had Chinese literature, the poems that.

440
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:11,330
Speaker 0: Right.

441
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:18,270
Speaker 0: It's like there wasn't like a whole bookstore full of novels that this this woman could read to learn to be a better writer from.

442
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,274
Speaker 1: But look at the craft.

443
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:23,330
Speaker 1: Like the craft of media has changed so much because right now I'm watching a bunch of Star Trek.

444
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:25,670
Speaker 1: So I'm watching old Star Trek and new Star Trek.

445
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:34,230
Speaker 1: And it's very stark to look at TV shows from the 70s, 80s, 90s and like how they were constructed.

446
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:36,743
Speaker 1: They feel very poorly put together.

447
00:30:36,823 --> 00:30:38,210
Speaker 1: The scripts don't feel that good.

448
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,810
Speaker 1: There's a lot of downtime and sort of dead ends and just the craft wasn't there yet.

449
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,995
Speaker 1: And the craft has evolved.

450
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:46,390
Speaker 1: Modern entertainment a couple decades later is denser.

451
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,156
Speaker 1: The stories are tighter.

452
00:30:48,418 --> 00:30:49,383
Speaker 1: They're more focused.

453
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:50,770
Speaker 1: Like audiences change.

454
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,695
Speaker 1: But also the craft advances.

455
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:58,270
Speaker 0: So not but not only does it advance over a long period of multiple people.

456
00:30:58,471 --> 00:30:58,651
Speaker 0: Right.

457
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:04,410
Speaker 0: But you could see even with if you just forget the the later the post Genji's death chapters.

458
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:04,891
Speaker 0: Right.

459
00:31:05,374 --> 00:31:07,866
Speaker 0: You can see it advance within those.

460
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:08,730
Speaker 0: Right.

461
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:14,830
Speaker 0: The same way when you look at something like a webcomic and you see the oldest strips are like are way better to say.

462
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:19,070
Speaker 1: I just looked at a penny arcade from twenty two years ago when Gabe proposed.

463
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:20,272
Speaker 0: Right.

464
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:24,710
Speaker 0: It's like you can see the artist improving their art just because they're doing it right.

465
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:29,387
Speaker 0: The author of The Tale of Genji gets better at writing as the book.

466
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:30,090
Speaker 0: the chapters go.

467
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:30,912
Speaker 1: Absolutely not.

468
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:32,116
Speaker 0: It's not.

469
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:36,370
Speaker 0: I thought, you know, it was hard to tell because I was like, am I just getting better at reading this book?

470
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:37,615
Speaker 1: Right.

471
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:38,218
Speaker 1: Early chapter.

472
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,727
Speaker 1: I still don't know what happened sometimes.

473
00:31:39,988 --> 00:31:40,270
Speaker 0: Right.

474
00:31:40,591 --> 00:31:41,956
Speaker 0: It's like that is a part of it.

475
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:45,990
Speaker 0: You do get better at reading it, you know, as you go on and push through.

476
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:51,410
Speaker 0: But no, the early chapters are written way worse, way harder to follow.

477
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:58,850
Speaker 0: You know that, you know, it can't just be the translator getting better at translating because they clearly edited and went through how many times.

478
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,755
Speaker 0: They spent their whole life studying the book.

479
00:32:01,096 --> 00:32:05,830
Speaker 0: I don't feel like they put more effort into translating the later chapters than the earlier ones.

480
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:14,330
Speaker 1: But like around when Genji gets exiled and then comes back and like that second the second phase, I guess, of the very hard to follow what's going on around there.

481
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:14,811
Speaker 0: Yeah.

482
00:32:14,872 --> 00:32:17,289
Speaker 1: But right after that, it just gets easier and easier to follow.

483
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:17,691
Speaker 1: Yep.

484
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:29,350
Speaker 1: But those ones, the third set of chapters, what struck me the most about the third part, like after Genji's death, is that the characters felt faker, but were easier to understand.

485
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:42,550
Speaker 1: And their relationships felt very planned in advance in a way that it didn't feel to the reader, to me at least, in the early chapters that there was a plan for exactly how this was going to go down.

486
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:49,730
Speaker 1: Like she was writing this almost chapter by chapter, but the later chapters feel like this was designed to wrap itself up in a particular way.

487
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:58,750
Speaker 1: This character is going to be here to serve this purpose in the plot as opposed to this is a character that would make sense to be there based on what I'm writing about.

488
00:32:59,171 --> 00:33:03,010
Speaker 1: I don't know if that was her motivation, but that stood out to me as a reader.

489
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,051
Speaker 0: Yeah.

490
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:10,250
Speaker 0: So, I mean, there's a lot of debates about, you know, who wrote what and, you know, because we don't know for sure any of these sorts of things.

491
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:10,391
Speaker 0: Yeah.

492
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:12,301
Speaker 1: This is from the like the twelve hundreds.

493
00:33:12,382 --> 00:33:13,790
Speaker 1: Like this is a long time ago.

494
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,998
Speaker 0: But my personal head, head cannon.

495
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:17,560
Speaker 0: Right.

496
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:20,729
Speaker 0: Is that, you know, she started writing this thing.

497
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:21,373
Speaker 0: Yeah.

498
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:23,590
Speaker 0: You know, just like for fun, like here.

499
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,351
Speaker 0: Right.

500
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:28,748
Speaker 0: You know, wrote like a chapter or two about this awesome dude, Genji.

501
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:29,149
Speaker 0: Right.

502
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,064
Speaker 1: Hey, you want to read about the hottest goddamn person to ever be born?

503
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:34,309
Speaker 1: Well, I got a story for you.

504
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:35,652
Speaker 0: Right.

505
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:39,847
Speaker 0: So wrote like a chapter or two and then people were into it.

506
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:40,670
Speaker 0: Right.

507
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,537
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, I got nothing else to do.

508
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:42,938
Speaker 0: Right.

509
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:43,882
Speaker 0: And I love doing this.

510
00:33:43,902 --> 00:33:45,689
Speaker 0: I'll keep doing it.

511
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,941
Speaker 0: You know, and then there was demand for it now.

512
00:33:49,022 --> 00:33:51,130
Speaker 0: So there's like pressure to like deliver on this.

513
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,470
Speaker 1: Imagine even if it was just the court at first, like, like we start way back there doing gig nights.

514
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,578
Speaker 1: Then some people like, hey, I actually like gig nights.

515
00:33:57,879 --> 00:34:00,710
Speaker 1: Someone who isn't our friend contacted us once like, oh, someone's listening.

516
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:08,570
Speaker 1: And so imagine now the author is like, well, I'm going to start like planning a little more or writing more or thinking about what would my audience want to see?

517
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:11,202
Speaker 1: I know I'll have him sleep with the wrong person.

518
00:34:11,242 --> 00:34:11,925
Speaker 1: That'll be great.

519
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:12,949
Speaker 0: Yep.

520
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:23,870
Speaker 0: So, you know, you know, and then as over time they got better at writing, you know, maybe, you know, perhaps there were some parts where like they were reluctant to go on, but they went on instead.

521
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:24,612
Speaker 0: Right.

522
00:34:25,137 --> 00:34:26,908
Speaker 0: Who knows what was going on in their lives.

523
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,150
Speaker 0: Right.

524
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:38,210
Speaker 0: You know, a lot of the things I could, you know, I could imagine a lot of the things I see in the book happening to the author, you know, illnesses or having to move or, you know, who knows what, right.

525
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,001
Speaker 0: All kinds of dramas, you know, incorporating those.

526
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:42,362
Speaker 0: probably.

527
00:34:42,402 --> 00:34:45,270
Speaker 0: maybe, you know, there could be things in here that we don't even know.

528
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:56,090
Speaker 0: Like, you know, maybe some of the, you know, uh, there could be some like, uh, you know, like chapters that are basically distracts against real people that they knew.

529
00:34:56,591 --> 00:34:56,851
Speaker 0: Right.

530
00:34:56,953 --> 00:35:00,766
Speaker 0: Like the same way that like art musicians will sing songs about their ex.

531
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:01,228
Speaker 0: Right.

532
00:35:01,288 --> 00:35:01,529
Speaker 0: Yeah.

533
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:06,349
Speaker 0: There could be some of that shit in here and you just don't even realize it that it's going on.

534
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:13,289
Speaker 1: Um, you know, there were a bunch of moments where I would feel like that was true, but I did couldn't articulate it.

535
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,331
Speaker 0: Right.

536
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:18,561
Speaker 0: Like, you know, like the right, you know, they have a character who's like, you know, portrayed negatively.

537
00:35:18,621 --> 00:35:22,130
Speaker 0: and it's like, is that character someone they knew and they're portraying them in here.

538
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:27,890
Speaker 1: Like especially Genji's wife in particular, it felt like, did you know someone who you really didn't like in the card?

539
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:29,331
Speaker 0: Like, yep.

540
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:31,837
Speaker 0: Or you, you, you saw a story happen.

541
00:35:31,877 --> 00:35:37,949
Speaker 0: So you write the story, you know, you, you know, you take a rumor you heard and write it down with other characters.

542
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,230
Speaker 0: Right.

543
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,552
Speaker 0: Something like that.

544
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:45,430
Speaker 0: Um, but that, you know, so as for the chapters that come after Genji's death, right.

545
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:50,302
Speaker 0: You know, it's not like the previous chapters, you see a gradual improvement.

546
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:53,550
Speaker 0: It's this sudden jump into a different mode of writing.

547
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,239
Speaker 0: So obviously other, you know, people have all kinds of explanations.

548
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,630
Speaker 0: It could be a different author, uh, in which case it's like a fan fiction addendum.

549
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:10,450
Speaker 0: Uh, it could be, you know, you know, Oh, she stopped writing Genji, but we must, we must have more Genji and the emperor told someone to write more.

550
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:11,352
Speaker 0: Right.

551
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:16,362
Speaker 0: Um, you know, it could, you could imagine so many possible explanations.

552
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:19,970
Speaker 0: Maybe there was a, they got tired of Genji and they said, that's enough of that.

553
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:28,430
Speaker 0: And then, you know, they were still alive and they were pressured to write more, but they were so much better at writing by that time that they were able to, but they didn't have enough new ideas.

554
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:34,086
Speaker 0: And then therefore they produced, uh, you know, those, those ending chapters and then they passed away.

555
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:35,409
Speaker 0: And that's why it ends sort of.

556
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,117
Speaker 1: I did skim her biography.

557
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:42,650
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm not going to like relate everything because, you know, go read it yourself or read the Wikipedia page.

558
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:51,949
Speaker 1: But one thing that was very clear is it's it, most people agree that she published it herself with her own ladies in waiting to a small audience, almost like a zine at first.

559
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:58,147
Speaker 1: And it got popular and eventually patrons started to like fund it and it grew from there.

560
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,106
Speaker 0: Yep.

561
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:00,229
Speaker 0: Yep.

562
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,778
Speaker 1: Which that's how, that's, that's how webcomics happened today.

563
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:09,288
Speaker 1: Like almost directly, like someone makes a webcomic, cost of money, 1200 something.

564
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:13,006
Speaker 1: Yeah.

565
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:21,230
Speaker 1: But, uh, let's see what other meta can I think of around the tale of Genji that we didn't talk about in the first episode to avoid talking about Genji and the characters again.

566
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:27,430
Speaker 1: But the thing that was just thrown out the most was how much easier those later chapters were to read and how tighter they felt.

567
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:28,452
Speaker 0: Yeah.

568
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:34,182
Speaker 0: I guess we got, you know, I guess we can talk about, you know, I don't know too much about right.

569
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:38,790
Speaker 0: What, what it was like, you know, the history of what was going on in that era.

570
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:51,550
Speaker 1: That my knowledge of Heian era is that it was a deeply dysfunctional and extremely divided Japanese society where the nobles really didn't interact with normal people at all.

571
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:55,395
Speaker 0: And I, I mean, that's what it seems like in the book.

572
00:37:55,415 --> 00:38:07,670
Speaker 0: and the other, I think the number one thing that just like stood out the most in the book was, you know, how, uh, women were so like cloistered and secluded.

573
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:13,162
Speaker 0: And like, you know, we talk about objectification of women in today's society, right?

574
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:15,026
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like literally.

575
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:16,790
Speaker 0: it's like you own some women, right?

576
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,827
Speaker 0: It's like there wasn't any woman that didn't belong to somebody.

577
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:20,350
Speaker 0: Right.

578
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,637
Speaker 1: Well, when there's a woman living on her own, it was always, it happens a few times in the tale of Genji.

579
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,563
Speaker 1: It's always a like, yeah, who's paying her bills?

580
00:38:27,603 --> 00:38:28,324
Speaker 1: Like what's going on?

581
00:38:28,345 --> 00:38:31,070
Speaker 1: They're living in this decrepit house somewhere cause there's no man around.

582
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:32,010
Speaker 0: Yeah.

583
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:36,018
Speaker 0: Who's, who's take, you know, I need to make sure all my daughters are taking, you know, belong to someone.

584
00:38:36,078 --> 00:38:36,800
Speaker 0: I'm going to die.

585
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,140
Speaker 0: Right.

586
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:41,710
Speaker 0: Someone's I had to make sure that each one has some man to take care of them.

587
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:48,357
Speaker 0: Uh, and like, you know, you can't let anyone, like you talk about modesty, like, you know, Victorian or whatever, right?

588
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:50,140
Speaker 0: Like can't show any ankles and whatnot.

589
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:59,190
Speaker 0: This is like, you cannot let anyone see you unless like they're your like father, uh, maybe not even your brother, you know, unless you're a child.

590
00:38:59,470 --> 00:38:59,671
Speaker 0: Right.

591
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:05,442
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, once you're, you know, I guess the donning of the train maybe is that comes up a few times in the book.

592
00:39:05,482 --> 00:39:08,728
Speaker 0: I assume that some sort of adult coming ceremony.

593
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,710
Speaker 0: I didn't research it.

594
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:15,877
Speaker 0: Uh, but it's like, yeah, it's like, once you're an adult woman, it's like, nobody sees you except your staff.

595
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:19,181
Speaker 0: You know, you're like your parents, right?

596
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:22,625
Speaker 0: Uh, your children, uh, you know, your spouse.

597
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:26,229
Speaker 0: It's like you are, you are hidden behind walls.

598
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:26,810
Speaker 0: Right.

599
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:35,418
Speaker 0: Um, and that really struck me because even if you watch, you know, all sorts of, you know, samurai movies and stuff, right.

600
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:41,263
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, the women aren't, you know, they're hidden and protected, but not that level of right.

601
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:48,849
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, you'll still see scenes or like someone's bowing before, you know, the empress who's sitting there getting mad or something.

602
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,470
Speaker 0: Right.

603
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:55,758
Speaker 0: Um, whereas here it's like in this time, clearly the empress would be behind some wall and you wouldn't even know.

604
00:39:55,778 --> 00:40:05,490
Speaker 1: It's like, you only know that they're there because you know, but what I do find interesting is these, this book portrays the rich inner lives of what is happening behind those walls.

605
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:08,954
Speaker 1: And it shows like the interactions that actually happen.

606
00:40:09,014 --> 00:40:20,527
Speaker 1: Like there's a, you know, the men have, they're, they're all hanging out together in the early part of the tale again, but you always see the echoes of the women behind that screen are all hanging out together and doing their own thing.

607
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:23,570
Speaker 1: And it's interesting to see that portrayed so directly.

608
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:38,590
Speaker 1: So the other thing is I know about the Han era just personally, and again, I'm probably radically overgeneralizing is that that government was extremely incompetent and got more and more incompetent and incapable of running the country as time went on.

609
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,192
Speaker 1: That's, that's a common trope.

610
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:46,217
Speaker 1: I've seen like currency started to fall apart, like banking institutions collapsed.

611
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:49,280
Speaker 1: Rice became the primary unit of exchange.

612
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,062
Speaker 1: Uh, I pulled up the Wikipedia.

613
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:51,463
Speaker 1: Oh God.

614
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:51,663
Speaker 1: Yeah.

615
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:52,064
Speaker 1: Right here.

616
00:40:52,404 --> 00:40:54,066
Speaker 1: The money circulation fell apart.

617
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:57,730
Speaker 1: Rice became literally the primary unit of exchange.

618
00:40:59,751 --> 00:40:59,992
Speaker 1: Yep.

619
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:06,982
Speaker 1: Get the reason they were giving gifts to each other so much, largely because there wasn't any other way to transfer value and transfer wealth.

620
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:12,710
Speaker 0: So in the book, yeah, throughout the book, they were constantly gifting things to each other.

621
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:22,381
Speaker 1: When Genji goes into exile, like he's wealthy and he stops at a bunch of his storehouses, his wealth is big warehouses he owns filled with his shit.

622
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:29,570
Speaker 1: And he goes and like gets stuff from those warehouses to bring with him, to give to people as gifts, to pay them basically.

623
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:30,811
Speaker 0: Yeah.

624
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:33,636
Speaker 0: Every, everywhere they go, they're constantly gifting, right?

625
00:41:33,756 --> 00:41:34,036
Speaker 0: Yeah.

626
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:36,881
Speaker 0: You know, here have some, you know, there's a ceremony.

627
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:40,387
Speaker 0: Ah, they gave everyone gifts and whoever danced the best got the best gift.

628
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:41,870
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, yeah.

629
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:45,185
Speaker 1: But that was partly because there really wasn't a currency to trade.

630
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:46,190
Speaker 1: You couldn't give someone a tip.

631
00:41:47,511 --> 00:42:00,430
Speaker 0: I guess, uh, there's also, the book also talks a lot about th you know, these really small details, you know, you know, I guess in, in modern times you talk about it, like appreciating this, the little things in life.

632
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:08,699
Speaker 0: Um, but there's a lot of text in this book dedicated to going through extreme detail about the little things in life, right?

633
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,684
Speaker 0: Like they're constantly perfuming things themselves, papers, right?

634
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:17,869
Speaker 0: Cause it's just like, there isn't that much sensory entertainment.

635
00:42:17,889 --> 00:42:19,050
Speaker 0: There's no VR, right?

636
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,490
Speaker 0: So it's like perfuming things, you know, looking at flowers.

637
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,685
Speaker 1: They talk a lot about, oh shit, that's the good colored paper.

638
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:26,530
Speaker 1: Oh, God damn.

639
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:27,351
Speaker 0: Right.

640
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:30,917
Speaker 0: It's like they go to look at flowers the way that you would go to Disney world.

641
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:34,182
Speaker 0: You know, it's like all this kind of stuff, right?

642
00:42:34,383 --> 00:42:38,870
Speaker 0: These things that we would consider like simple pleasures are like big pleasures.

643
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,075
Speaker 1: So I found a historical statistic that really puts this into light.

644
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:51,270
Speaker 1: The aristocracy, the people portrayed in the tale of Genji are referred to contemporarily by a Japanese word that basically means the good people.

645
00:42:52,031 --> 00:43:00,179
Speaker 1: And there were about 5,000 of them total in a nation of around five to 6 million.

646
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:10,289
Speaker 1: And so 5,000 extremely wealthy people playing games and singing and living in this closed existence and five or 6 million people living in desperate poverty around them.

647
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:13,273
Speaker 0: Yeah.

648
00:43:13,313 --> 00:43:16,790
Speaker 0: The book pretty much never talks about the people living in the poverty.

649
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:21,077
Speaker 1: Remember way back I kept talking about that one scene with normal dialogue?

650
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,502
Speaker 1: That never happens again in the book.

651
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:28,370
Speaker 1: You never have a normal person say words other than that one scene in like chapter five.

652
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,797
Speaker 0: And it even seems like, you know, it's like, okay, you've got like, you know, the empress.

653
00:43:32,937 --> 00:43:40,070
Speaker 0: and the empress has, you know, women around her, but those women don't seem like they're peasants, right?

654
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:46,810
Speaker 0: Those women are like, ah, yes, some merchant's daughter was sent to the palace to, you know, to, right.

655
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:50,897
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, they're, and they're like sent, you know, they're sending each other's.

656
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:58,470
Speaker 0: like, you know, some of their children who end up not being, you know, so high ranking are sent to work for someone.

657
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:01,494
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, those are still like noble people.

658
00:44:01,574 --> 00:44:04,338
Speaker 0: They're just lower ranked noble people.

659
00:44:04,418 --> 00:44:11,407
Speaker 0: Like the actual peasant people, like planting rice, you know, doing actual hard labor.

660
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:13,630
Speaker 0: People are like not even present.

661
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,957
Speaker 1: All I can think of is there's a song in Centra World.

662
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:18,927
Speaker 1: Please, sir, tell me where food comes from.

663
00:44:19,107 --> 00:44:19,890
Speaker 1: Like that song.

664
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:30,190
Speaker 1: But the other thing that I see just skimming this around that era that was, that came up a lot in the Tale of Genji, they talk a lot about how difficult and dangerous travel is.

665
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:34,578
Speaker 1: Like, your fence being broken is a big deal.

666
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:40,310
Speaker 1: Like if your fence is not able to be sealed, they basically let the police forces completely collapse.

667
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:45,390
Speaker 1: And there were just robbers and brigands anywhere outside of the walled cities and outside of the walled estates.

668
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:52,430
Speaker 0: And they're always traveling like in a, in like a wagon, like basically a thing with two wheels that someone's pulling.

669
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,309
Speaker 1: Usually with a big entourage and armed guards and like heralds.

670
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,380
Speaker 0: It's basically, it's similar to Oregon Trail.

671
00:44:59,561 --> 00:45:01,309
Speaker 0: only humans are pulling instead of oxen.

672
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:09,350
Speaker 0: Or, you know, like a, you know, a, you know, what's the call where you just people just pick you pick you right the fuck up, right?

673
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:12,450
Speaker 0: But I forget what those are called, Polonkin, whatever.

674
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,409
Speaker 1: Or Palquins?

675
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:16,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's something like that, right?

676
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,470
Speaker 0: People just pick you up and carry you through the street.

677
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:20,718
Speaker 0: But yeah, they always travel, right?

678
00:45:20,758 --> 00:45:22,444
Speaker 0: Like with people, right?

679
00:45:22,504 --> 00:45:24,190
Speaker 0: No one's just going and walking around.

680
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:28,550
Speaker 1: Well, the book, it's very clear because a few times Genji goes off by himself or mostly by himself in disguise.

681
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,470
Speaker 0: When he goes mostly by himself, he's like only with his trusted like five dudes.

682
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:33,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I was about to get at.

683
00:45:34,155 --> 00:45:38,909
Speaker 1: Genji going off like surreptitiously is still this giant like entourage.

684
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,730
Speaker 1: They're just wearing what I imagine are flimsy disguises and nobody's fooled.

685
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:48,210
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's more like if he's only traveling with five or ten dudes, he must be a lower ranked.

686
00:45:48,434 --> 00:45:48,590
Speaker 0: Yeah.

687
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:51,564
Speaker 0: You know, you're trying, you're like almost the emperor, right?

688
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:52,890
Speaker 0: You're pretty close, right?

689
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,246
Speaker 0: The emperor would come out with like a fucking army, right?

690
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:57,076
Speaker 1: It's like a Monty Python.

691
00:45:57,137 --> 00:45:57,961
Speaker 1: How do you know he's a king?

692
00:45:57,981 --> 00:45:59,208
Speaker 1: He hasn't got shit all over him.

693
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:00,633
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

694
00:46:00,673 --> 00:46:05,430
Speaker 0: But, you know, so it's like, okay, well, normally when you come out, you come out with a hundred dudes.

695
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:19,427
Speaker 0: So you come out with five dudes and that's your disguise as a lower ranked person who's, you know, so that maybe people, you know, you still got guards, but you wouldn't go out by yourself because people would be like, hey, there's someone who hasn't got shit all over him all by themselves.

696
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:20,189
Speaker 0: Let's fucking rob him.

697
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:20,872
Speaker 1: Yeah.

698
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,630
Speaker 1: And it's telling because, you know, there's like, then she sneaks away with that girl early on and they just go to an event.

699
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:30,284
Speaker 1: There's a lot of abandoned structures and abandoned estates all over the place.

700
00:46:30,766 --> 00:46:32,110
Speaker 1: Like you feel that in the books.

701
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,955
Speaker 0: And well, some of them is like become abandoned.

702
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:35,175
Speaker 0: Right.

703
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:42,890
Speaker 0: And you can see that like in the story, it's like, ah, a family was here and then a dude died or a dude moved or someone got married.

704
00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:43,932
Speaker 0: Right.

705
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:53,010
Speaker 0: And just the way that the families and the hierarchy is structured and shifts, it's like, you know, the, the great, you know, even, you know, the, the Roku Joe, right.

706
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:56,315
Speaker 0: Genji's house on the sixth street, right.

707
00:46:56,355 --> 00:47:05,170
Speaker 0: The Roku, um, you know, which is like the, the big, like central location of the majority of the book where most of the action is.

708
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:25,590
Speaker 0: It's like, it had its Heyday when Genji was there with all his wives and then, you know, people are still there, but after Genji dies, you know, you can, you can tell, even though it doesn't come up in the story very much at that place, like declines, you know, cause there's not really, you know, there's no Genji, no great person living there anymore.

709
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,173
Speaker 0: There's like the remnants of Genji's family living there.

710
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:28,914
Speaker 0: Right.

711
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:35,101
Speaker 0: And as they move out or marry other people or die, it's like that place goes downhill.

712
00:47:35,641 --> 00:47:43,090
Speaker 0: And if it's not up kept, then, you know, and there's not a lot of staff working there that who the hell wants to live there.

713
00:47:43,651 --> 00:47:43,891
Speaker 0: Yeah.

714
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:54,490
Speaker 0: You would, you would need to wait for it to be like completely empty and then for someone to need a new house to go in there and take it and refreshing it is someone with a lot of power and money and whatnot.

715
00:47:55,210 --> 00:48:08,910
Speaker 1: Um, and that's kind of how the hand era eventually ended is that the nobility was so rich and so disconnected that basically the, what little military they're maintained, like people like Genji who ostensibly was a captain to the guard or whatever at one point.

716
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,611
Speaker 0: Yeah.

717
00:48:09,631 --> 00:48:16,619
Speaker 0: A lot of the people have military titles, you know, the, the, the, the, you know, the whatever of war, right?

718
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:25,990
Speaker 0: All these people, but it was an era of mostly, you never see any, the only military stuff you see will be like for entertainment, like boat archery competitions or horse riding.

719
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:35,549
Speaker 1: So basically later on, like post when the tale of Genji was set, the people who were actually doing the military work kind of just took over because no one could stop them.

720
00:48:37,156 --> 00:48:37,464
Speaker 0: Hmm.

721
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:53,350
Speaker 1: But it's interesting to read this from the perspective of we're seeing like this narrow glimpse into and some by some arguments, the height of hand culture, like the most peaceful era right before it collapsed.

722
00:48:53,991 --> 00:49:08,370
Speaker 1: Like it didn't last that much longer after the era that was portrayed, but at the same time, we're seeing the height only from the perspective of the people who were living the, the best wealthiest lives within what was otherwise an extremely broken society.

723
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:15,170
Speaker 1: Very similar to many times throughout history, including our own time right now.

724
00:49:15,354 --> 00:49:15,502
Speaker 1: Yeah.

725
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:16,710
Speaker 0: Yeah.

726
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:30,690
Speaker 0: But you know, it's like, even though these people were like, you know, the extremely wealthy 1%, you know, there's at least in the book, there's no depiction of them doing like incredibly cruel things.

727
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,186
Speaker 1: No, they're just doing nothing.

728
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:34,789
Speaker 1: Like the outside world just doesn't exist.

729
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:35,810
Speaker 0: Right.

730
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,730
Speaker 0: It's like they're living a life of leisure.

731
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,210
Speaker 0: And, you know, enjoying wondrous arts.

732
00:49:41,597 --> 00:49:41,730
Speaker 0: Right.

733
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,130
Speaker 0: You know, some of them are very religious.

734
00:49:44,437 --> 00:49:44,690
Speaker 0: Right.

735
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:47,429
Speaker 0: You know, and they actually give up worldly things.

736
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:55,170
Speaker 1: You know, and that was the theme in hand era too, especially as Buddhism started to become popular among the nobles, then you'd see a lot of that.

737
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:57,289
Speaker 1: There were a bunch of emperors who were like, fuck it.

738
00:49:57,735 --> 00:49:58,308
Speaker 1: I'm a monk now.

739
00:49:58,554 --> 00:49:59,129
Speaker 1: You're on your own.

740
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,410
Speaker 1: Good luck.

741
00:49:59,532 --> 00:49:59,766
Speaker 1: Have fun.

742
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:00,520
Speaker 0: Yeah.

743
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,569
Speaker 0: A lot of women want to become, you know, nuns.

744
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:03,890
Speaker 1: Well, you saw that in Europe.

745
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:09,530
Speaker 1: A lot of women, if you look at like different parts of European society and different eras in the medieval times.

746
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:12,550
Speaker 1: I can live this horrible life and marry that shit bag.

747
00:50:12,671 --> 00:50:15,549
Speaker 1: Or I can go join a nunnery and escape all that.

748
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,245
Speaker 1: A lot of people would choose the nunnery.

749
00:50:20,014 --> 00:50:21,925
Speaker 1: I mean, even Genji's grooms of life.

750
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,350
Speaker 0: If it wasn't for the religion part, you know, being like even a Christian monk, right?

751
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:30,610
Speaker 0: It's like, that's kind of, you know, it's kind of cool except for the Christian part.

752
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:37,250
Speaker 1: Well, it's also a way to escape the like the actual violent reality of the society outside of that institution.

753
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,730
Speaker 0: I think that's what's appealing.

754
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:42,110
Speaker 0: If I think about becoming, you know, some sort of religious monk.

755
00:50:42,398 --> 00:50:42,670
Speaker 0: Right.

756
00:50:43,151 --> 00:50:45,770
Speaker 0: It's like the religious part isn't the appealing part.

757
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,950
Speaker 0: The escape capitalism is the appealing part.

758
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:52,549
Speaker 0: It's like it's like a. it's like the one way to escape capitalism is to win at it.

759
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,018
Speaker 0: Right.

760
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,090
Speaker 0: You have so much money.

761
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,230
Speaker 0: You don't have to do anything anymore.

762
00:50:55,330 --> 00:51:05,745
Speaker 0: But another way is like, yeah, there's some organization like a church or whatever, you know, or even though you're living an ascetic life of some kind, you know, it's still a life.

763
00:51:06,032 --> 00:51:08,410
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, it's not the worst.

764
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:08,950
Speaker 0: Right.

765
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:11,850
Speaker 0: It's not like homeless, you know, absolute destitution.

766
00:51:12,731 --> 00:51:24,747
Speaker 0: And, you know, you're if you can enjoy the smaller things in life, you know, like, you know, nice smells and tasty foods and whatnot, you know, like Belgian monks making delicious beers, which I don't even like.

767
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:26,248
Speaker 0: Stuff like that.

768
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:27,113
Speaker 0: It's like.

769
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:36,510
Speaker 0: that can be a fulfilling life, you know, and if you have the opportunity to do it, then it could be a good choice, even if you're an extremely wealthy emperor.

770
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,710
Speaker 0: That could be an appealing choice.

771
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,210
Speaker 0: Get away from all this fucking drama in this palace.

772
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:41,889
Speaker 0: Right.

773
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:49,830
Speaker 0: It's like or avoid getting married off to some just random rags at some dude you hate is going to treat you like property.

774
00:51:50,292 --> 00:51:55,129
Speaker 0: You know, but if you're I guess if you're a peasant, you probably don't even have the opportunity to go become a monk.

775
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:55,844
Speaker 0: You know.

776
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:01,290
Speaker 1: Well, even though when he's living in exile, there's that family and they're like, oh, we got a bandit.

777
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:06,226
Speaker 1: We got to hook our daughter up with Genji because this is like the richest person who's ever going to come to this town again.

778
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,089
Speaker 0: All right.

779
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,970
Speaker 0: Is there anything else to say about this book?

780
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,489
Speaker 0: I guess we're never going to have to talk about it again on this show.

781
00:52:14,896 --> 00:52:15,047
Speaker 0: Nope.

782
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:17,509
Speaker 1: I I'm glad we read it.

783
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,903
Speaker 1: Like, I enjoyed reading it.

784
00:52:19,711 --> 00:52:19,815
Speaker 0: I did.

785
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,849
Speaker 0: You know, it's not like my favorite book.

786
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:30,709
Speaker 0: But and I, I guess I was disappointed in that there's not actually I don't have an encounter as many references to it as I expected in other words.

787
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:39,069
Speaker 1: It's good to know about it, though, like not not every nice book club book is going to be like a bad a thousand hit with us.

788
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,190
Speaker 0: This was I did learn a lot.

789
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,528
Speaker 0: I did learn a lot of things.

790
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:45,010
Speaker 1: You know, I got interested.

791
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:51,048
Speaker 1: I got more to actually got interested enough in hay in history to start reading like high level like this.

792
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:55,150
Speaker 1: It's an era I'd like to know more about, but I'm not going to become an expert on it.

793
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:55,592
Speaker 1: But I want to.

794
00:52:55,853 --> 00:53:01,149
Speaker 1: I would have a working knowledge of that era, which I did not have in any capacity before I read this book.

795
00:53:01,571 --> 00:53:08,090
Speaker 1: And I'm close to having like a very broad strokes like I would have about Europe during that time knowledge.

796
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:17,330
Speaker 0: But, you know, my secondary reason, right, my primary reason of trying to, you know, get more literary references between things.

797
00:53:17,491 --> 00:53:19,029
Speaker 0: I didn't really pan out so much.

798
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:35,190
Speaker 0: But my secondary reason of drawing parallels between, you know, the people of today and the people of then in terms of media culture and also, you know, the form of the novel parallels between current novels and the original novel.

799
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:36,112
Speaker 0: Right.

800
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,909
Speaker 0: As I think that I batted a thousand on.

801
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:38,414
Speaker 0: Right.

802
00:53:38,454 --> 00:53:38,738
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

803
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:39,630
Speaker 0: Just so right.

804
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:43,430
Speaker 0: It's like you can see exactly where it's like, oh, I have an example.

805
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:43,831
Speaker 1: I got.

806
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:45,143
Speaker 1: well, I mentioned that star years ago.

807
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,850
Speaker 0: The reason I think this is what counts as a novel today.

808
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:51,569
Speaker 0: And you can see exactly how they line up.

809
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:52,131
Speaker 1: Yeah.

810
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:56,271
Speaker 1: But I mentioned the Star Trek stuff because I'm watching a lot of older media lately.

811
00:53:57,414 --> 00:54:03,511
Speaker 1: And I've really like it really stands out the differences in like the craft over time.

812
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:14,910
Speaker 1: But it also stands out that older media has the same fundamental truths because humans have the same fundamental interests when not subverted by situation, circumstance, capitalism, et cetera.

813
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:15,051
Speaker 0: Yep.

814
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:26,848
Speaker 0: Even in this completely different culture, completely different language, completely different circumstances, you know, they're passing memes around and enjoying music and trying to escape capitalism.

815
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,770
Speaker 0: The humans are still human.

816
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:29,735
Speaker 0: Right.

817
00:54:29,755 --> 00:54:30,239
Speaker 0: They didn't have.

818
00:54:30,279 --> 00:54:31,469
Speaker 0: capitalism wasn't invented yet.

819
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:39,630
Speaker 0: But it's like they still have all these things that are just innately human that we can you know, we can see the same motivations.

820
00:54:40,191 --> 00:54:41,309
Speaker 0: You know, we see jealousy.

821
00:54:41,672 --> 00:54:45,070
Speaker 0: You know, all these same same things that we see today.

822
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,829
Speaker 0: You know, fan art.

823
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:54,110
Speaker 1: Well, thus so the the the act of making an increasingly distant from current culture.

824
00:54:54,231 --> 00:54:57,750
Speaker 1: Simpsons reference is, in fact, echoing the tale of Genji.

825
00:54:58,133 --> 00:54:59,789
Speaker 1: And therefore, I will continue to do this.

826
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:06,609
Speaker 1: And when I'm 90 and I write, I reference the I reference The Simpsons and the kids have no idea what I'm talking about.

827
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:16,990
Speaker 0: That's no different than someone in the tale than this author referencing some Chinese poem that everyone at that time who is noble would know about in the tale of Genji.

828
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:24,523
Speaker 1: I can't say how many times in the tale of Genji I would read like a short section, like one quote paragraph, and it would get this feeling of.

829
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:26,210
Speaker 1: this is a joke I don't get.

830
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:28,090
Speaker 1: This is referencing something I don't get.

831
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,350
Speaker 1: This is clearly intended.

832
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,575
Speaker 0: The footnote would tell you.

833
00:55:30,616 --> 00:55:39,790
Speaker 0: the footnote tells you, ah, yes, this this is a reference to, you know, because they would make an analogy like, yeah, you smell like this something and it's like, what's the something?

834
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:41,390
Speaker 0: Oh, it's it.

835
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,169
Speaker 0: You know, it's a reference to this other poem.

836
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,449
Speaker 0: But not every something was X.

837
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:51,005
Speaker 1: Not every passage that gave me that feeling had a footnote.

838
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:54,649
Speaker 1: because I wonder, you know, this has been a long time since this was written.

839
00:55:55,332 --> 00:55:59,490
Speaker 1: How many references might be embedded in the text that aren't recognizable?

840
00:56:00,413 --> 00:56:00,827
Speaker 0: That's true.

841
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:02,452
Speaker 0: Or how many.

842
00:56:02,532 --> 00:56:04,757
Speaker 0: I literally became references themselves.

843
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:07,150
Speaker 1: Exactly.

844
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:13,210
Speaker 1: But at work a few weeks ago, I made a different Simpsons reference, like kind of casually as part of a conversation.

845
00:56:13,535 --> 00:56:13,968
Speaker 0: Which one?

846
00:56:14,874 --> 00:56:16,190
Speaker 1: Oh, it was actually it wasn't the same.

847
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,246
Speaker 1: It wasn't two knives, but it was the most is like it was I was just going to cut you a little.

848
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,688
Speaker 0: I was going to catch you.

849
00:56:21,991 --> 00:56:25,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I was going to cut you because I was like, just cut you a little bit.

850
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,969
Speaker 1: And like the guy laughed.

851
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:35,929
Speaker 1: But later we were talking and he was like and it was very clear that he thought I had made a joke on my own from nothing.

852
00:56:37,492 --> 00:56:39,650
Speaker 1: Like, I was like, no, that was just a reference to The Simpsons.

853
00:56:39,955 --> 00:56:40,869
Speaker 1: Like, I'm not that funny.

854
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,454
Speaker 1: And it sparked.

855
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:46,075
Speaker 1: it sparked an interesting conversation with someone who is 20 years younger than me.

856
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,869
Speaker 1: That just made me feel terrifyingly old.

857
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:52,270
Speaker 0: It's like you have not watched every Simpsons and Seinfeld episode ever.

858
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:54,587
Speaker 0: No, it's like some.

859
00:56:56,232 --> 00:56:57,381
Speaker 0: Was there some noble?

860
00:56:57,401 --> 00:56:58,590
Speaker 0: a hundred years?

861
00:56:58,912 --> 00:56:59,990
Speaker 0: You know, I guess not even a hundred.

862
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,709
Speaker 0: A few decades after the tale of Genji was no longer a big hit.

863
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:09,636
Speaker 0: I hadn't read all of the tale of Genji and then was missing references from grandpa dropping poems.

864
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:16,669
Speaker 1: But does the tale of Genji itself have references that were just missed by translators and lost to time?

865
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:18,124
Speaker 0: I don't know.

866
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,150
Speaker 1: Someday will people not remember?

867
00:57:20,511 --> 00:57:22,123
Speaker 0: I mean, the treasure could definitely be some.

868
00:57:23,391 --> 00:57:29,310
Speaker 0: But the fact that these translators have like they basically these are people who spent their whole lives studying this one fucking book.

869
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,529
Speaker 1: I feel like there aren't many.

870
00:57:30,892 --> 00:57:34,029
Speaker 1: But I feel like it's still possible just due to the distance of time.

871
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:40,730
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's that's the end of Genji's tale, at least as far as our lives are concerned.

872
00:57:41,152 --> 00:57:42,305
Speaker 0: So I'm going to make the post.

873
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:44,489
Speaker 1: It is official now.

874
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:46,970
Speaker 1: The book club book, which we will do soon.

875
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,209
Speaker 1: We're just going to give you some time to read.

876
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:50,070
Speaker 0: I already finished reading this book weeks ago.

877
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,109
Speaker 1: The City We Became by N.K.

878
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:52,684
Speaker 1: Jemisin.

879
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,130
Speaker 1: It's a it's a gig night.

880
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:55,606
Speaker 1: See book.

881
00:57:55,812 --> 00:57:56,969
Speaker 1: And I think you're going to like it.

882
00:57:57,393 --> 00:57:58,589
Speaker 1: And we're going to do a show on it.

883
00:57:59,271 --> 00:58:03,030
Speaker 0: It's got a. it's got a real big, big drop, right?

884
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:05,089
Speaker 0: The beat the beat drops close to the end.

885
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:06,114
Speaker 1: We'll do it in about.

886
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:10,567
Speaker 1: we'll do it in about a month in the best way, because it will not take you long to read this.

887
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:12,289
Speaker 0: I didn't take long at all.

888
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,449
Speaker 0: But yeah, we have for once.

889
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,430
Speaker 0: You had to wait for us to read.

890
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:16,869
Speaker 0: Now we're going to wait for you to read.

891
00:58:16,971 --> 00:58:17,927
Speaker 0: We'll give you a month or two.

892
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:18,350
Speaker 1: Yeah.

893
00:58:18,471 --> 00:58:20,650
Speaker 1: I feel like I'm going to have this book done before the end of February.

894
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,890
Speaker 1: But we'll still wait like a couple of weeks after that.

895
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,770
Speaker 1: Then we'll do the show or we'll record it in advance.

896
00:58:25,932 --> 00:58:27,549
Speaker 1: But we're going to publish it after a month.

897
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,089
Speaker 0: So that's not a bad idea.

898
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:30,270
Speaker 1: It's not a bad idea at all.

899
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,109
Speaker 1: Get ahead on the book club.

900
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:35,127
Speaker 0: Maybe we could put something like, you know, on the Internet and have like.

901
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:40,769
Speaker 0: people can come and check the box like when they finish reading it and then we can sort of track when it hits a certain amount.

902
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:41,790
Speaker 1: Yeah.

903
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:42,934
Speaker 1: Well, I want to.

904
00:58:42,975 --> 00:58:53,650
Speaker 1: I think now that we're rekindling the book club with a new book, we know that people will start reading the book around this time so we can talk about the book in the forum and the discord while we're all reading it together.

905
00:58:54,411 --> 00:59:01,048
Speaker 1: That used to happen with all the other book club books and only didn't happen with the Elegangy because because, you know, you know exactly why.

906
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:09,847
Speaker 0: Let us let us know if you plan on reading the city we became and, you know, let us know when you finish reading it.

907
00:59:11,232 --> 00:59:15,030
Speaker 1: So this has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

Speaker 1: I'll have it done pretty soon.

927
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,928
Speaker 1: We'll give you a month.

928
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:27,070
