1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,325
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, October 7th.

2
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:12,007
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:14,234
Speaker 0: I'm Sky, and this is Geek Nights!

4
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:15,759
Speaker 1: Tonight, via Paleti.

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,908
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:34,220
Speaker 1: So one of the things about PAX was that there, you know, there was a lot of swag to get.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,080
Speaker 1: I mean, we had those, well, we still have those Bomberman robot tattoos that I've been putting on semi-regularly since PAX.

8
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,795
Speaker 0: I don't know, I've put on the skull, and then I don't think I put it, that's the only one I ever put on.

9
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:47,740
Speaker 0: I still have the rest of them.

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,252
Speaker 1: Well, I put one on again for the New York Anime Festival.

11
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:54,383
Speaker 1: For some reason, it was just like, alright, I'm going to a con, I'm putting one on.

12
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:57,400
Speaker 1: I keep putting it on that same spot, like on my arm, like right on the tip of the muscle.

13
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:01,819
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna put one on at every con I go to until I run out.

14
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:03,065
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

15
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:04,718
Speaker 1: I think that's gonna be what I do.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,939
Speaker 0: Bomberman is out for the WiiWare, but I didn't buy it yet.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,203
Speaker 1: Why not?

18
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:11,175
Speaker 0: Because we didn't, we're not gonna play it yet.

19
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:12,060
Speaker 1: We could play it tonight.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,127
Speaker 0: I got too many other things to do tonight.

21
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,011
Speaker 1: Like what?

22
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:16,940
Speaker 1: I don't know, this podcast, maybe.

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,598
Speaker 0: This podcast, eating dinner.

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,844
Speaker 0: Eh, dinner's over.

25
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:21,820
Speaker 1: Plus, Emily said she'd cook dinner.

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,002
Speaker 0: Did she?

27
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:23,404
Speaker 0: Yeah.

28
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:24,369
Speaker 0: Is she gonna bring it here?

29
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:26,660
Speaker 1: Well, you could go over there, unless you're lazy.

30
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,680
Speaker 0: I don't really feel like going anywhere.

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,628
Speaker 1: Alright, then.

32
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:30,580
Speaker 0: I got stuff to do also.

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:45,000
Speaker 1: But anyway, you know, of all the stuff in PAX, you might recall that on the third night of Geek Nights coverage of PAX, or maybe I said it on another point, but I expressed how much I wish that I had one of those Fallout puppets.

34
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:50,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, it was sort of obvious that that was the best schwag at the con.

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,540
Speaker 0: I mean, usually free schwag, whatever, because it's usually just posters and other shit you throw away.

36
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:56,691
Speaker 0: But that was actually a schwag to keep.

37
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:58,320
Speaker 1: And they didn't give that many out.

38
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,880
Speaker 1: I mean, when you saw one, like, it was a rare event, and well, it wasn't that rare.

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:08,017
Speaker 0: You saw them all over the place, but even though you saw them all over the place, it was a rare event compared to the number of people out there.

40
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:11,876
Speaker 1: Like, you see 4,000 people walk by, and you see, like, three of them.

41
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:12,760
Speaker 1: They stand out.

42
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:15,880
Speaker 0: It's like you would always see one, you know, wherever, if you looked.

43
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,160
Speaker 0: But there wouldn't, per people, there weren't that many.

44
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,140
Speaker 0: There were a relative, very few number of them, and they were highly sought after.

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,707
Speaker 1: And I can, you know, throughout the con, a lot of people who didn't have them were always asking people, "How'd you get

46
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:27,807
Speaker 1: it?"

47
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:29,298
Speaker 1: And, "Duh, I went to the Fallout

48
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:29,500
Speaker 1: booth.".

49
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,880
Speaker 1: And I'm not quite sure how you got this, because everyone seemed to get different things from that Fallout booth.

50
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,460
Speaker 0: Well, I know that from what I heard, everyone who went to the Fallout booth got this book.

51
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,079
Speaker 0: That was actually a really cool book.

52
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:41,800
Speaker 1: Yeah.

53
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:46,860
Speaker 0: But, only some people who went to the Fallout booth got the puppet, as far as I know.

54
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,188
Speaker 0: I just had no idea what they did to do it.

55
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:52,520
Speaker 0: I don't know what they did, because I wasn't going to wait in that line to find out.

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,820
Speaker 1: I was thinking maybe they beat Fallout in the 20 minutes or whatever, however much time they had to play the game.

57
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:59,736
Speaker 0: I don't know, but some people got them, some people didn't.

58
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:00,400
Speaker 0: That's all you need to know.

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:08,420
Speaker 1: But, Andrew, if there's any doubt as to how cool these things are, the contest at Kotaku need no explanation.

60
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:14,000
Speaker 1: I wanted to enter it, but like every time there's a contest at Kotaku that's cool, we don't enter it.

61
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,373
Speaker 1: We just look at it and go, "Man, we could totally enter

62
00:03:16,393 --> 00:03:16,655
Speaker 1: that!"

63
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:17,540
Speaker 1: And then don't do anything.

64
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,079
Speaker 0: That's how it's supposed to be done.

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,621
Speaker 0: Yeah.

66
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:23,660
Speaker 1: Also, we were way out of our league right away when I saw what people had submitted.

67
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think because most of those people submitting are either people with skills, or people with lots of free time.

68
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,680
Speaker 0: And we have neither, at least not artistic skills.

69
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,720
Speaker 1: But they had one of these things to give away.

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,939
Speaker 1: So I remember idly, I said, "Man, if any of our listeners are awesome, and you want to give me a Fallout puppet, I'll make it worth your

71
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:45,260
Speaker 1: while.".

72
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:49,640
Speaker 1: And you realize that I did not expect in any capacity to get a Fallout puppet.

73
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,480
Speaker 0: I was saying, that's kind of like how I say it.

74
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,740
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have given one to like, if I had a favorite podcast, I sure as hell wouldn't have given him my Fallout puppet.

75
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,010
Speaker 1: It's kind of like when I emailed, say, Wil Wheaton.

76
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,799
Speaker 1: I was like, "Hey, you want to be on Geek

77
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:01,000
Speaker 1: Nights?".

78
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:04,273
Speaker 1: I didn't expect him to respond, or like Patrick Stewart or Barack Obama.

79
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:04,634
Speaker 1: You know what?

80
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:06,040
Speaker 1: None of them responded.

81
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,625
Speaker 1: But I didn't feel bad that they didn't respond.

82
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:14,319
Speaker 1: It's kind of like, it cost me 30 seconds to say, "Hey, will you be on my internet

83
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:14,920
Speaker 1: podcast?".

84
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:18,476
Speaker 1: And the worst case scenario is they hate me for the rest of forever, but...

85
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:19,815
Speaker 0: That's fine.

86
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,240
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't cost me anything.

87
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,119
Speaker 0: That's better than not knowing you.

88
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,940
Speaker 1: I mean, it's kind of like, I guess, if someone goes to Atlantic City or Vegas.

89
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,107
Speaker 1: You don't expect to win unless you're stupid.

90
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:30,031
Speaker 1: You expect to lose.

91
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:32,720
Speaker 1: If you do win, that's great, but you expect to lose.

92
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,631
Speaker 1: And you expect to lose all the effort you put into this.

93
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:36,160
Speaker 1: And maybe have a good time.

94
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:41,879
Speaker 1: I don't know if I had a good time emailing Wil Wheaton, but I had a little bit of a good time saying, "Hey, listeners, give me this

95
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:42,080
Speaker 1: thing.".

96
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:53,460
Speaker 1: Um, not one, not two, but four people offered me Fallout puppets within about 12 hours of that show going up.

97
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,700
Speaker 0: The only answer is that the Fallout puppets are cursed.

98
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,174
Speaker 1: Well played, there's clever girl.

99
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:04,640
Speaker 0: But, uh... The Froger is also cursed.

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,762
Speaker 1: I can say one thing.

101
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:09,190
Speaker 1: The first offer I got was quick and from someone awesome.

102
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:13,680
Speaker 1: The second offer I got was just almost as quick, but it was more awesome in the end.

103
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:23,360
Speaker 1: The third offer was shady, and I'm not going to say who, like the name or anything, but shady dude, no, I'm not going to pay you a large sum of money for the Fallout puppet.

104
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:26,995
Speaker 1: And I feel as though you were going to acquire it by underhanded means.

105
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,320
Speaker 1: It was just a shady email.

106
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:36,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sounded like the kind of person who was going to take money, then go on eBay and buy one with that money, and then send it to us and somehow profit.

107
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:38,232
Speaker 1: Or possibly scam me.

108
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:40,129
Speaker 0: My question is- It's like, I could have done that, dude.

109
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:40,412
Speaker 0: What?

110
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:41,320
Speaker 0: I don't need you to do it.

111
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:43,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was really scammy.

112
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:46,920
Speaker 1: But the fourth email sounded legitimate.

113
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:58,340
Speaker 1: Now, I feel like this might have been one of the one times in my life where I felt like maybe I should just take advantage of the tiny amount of fame I've got and get three Fallout puppets.

114
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,458
Speaker 0: What are you going to do with them?

115
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,473
Speaker 1: I'm going to parade them around, but then I realized that that might be evil.

116
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:08,515
Speaker 1: So, uh, I told two of the people- I have five PS3s.

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,379
Speaker 1: I told two- Daddy, two PP.

118
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:20,047
Speaker 1: So, I felt like, all right, I'm not going to ask all these people who have Fallout puppets.

119
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:27,880
Speaker 1: I'll ask one person, and then I decided to ask a second person just because I wasn't sure, and I wanted to make sure I got one.

120
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,520
Speaker 1: And the fact that I'm holding one in front of my face right now, fondling it gently, is testament to the fact that I got one.

121
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,499
Speaker 0: Testament that you fondle little boys?

122
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:38,539
Speaker 1: Well, it's not really a little boy.

123
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,459
Speaker 1: Misters never played Fallout.

124
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,080
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, it's, you know, your fantasy.

125
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,863
Speaker 1: What, playing Fallout?

126
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,108
Speaker 1: Yes, it's my fantasy.

127
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:52,061
Speaker 1: I really, really want to play Fallout 3.

128
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,100
Speaker 0: Eh, you know, I played Fallout 1 way back in the day.

129
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,945
Speaker 0: No, Fallout 1 was great back in the day, but it does not stand up to this- No, it was terrible back in the day.

130
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:02,500
Speaker 0: I tried to play it, and I died immediately, and I couldn't tell what to do, and the game made no sense.

131
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:04,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you also had trouble with Quest for Glory games.

132
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,595
Speaker 1: Like, yeah, I don't know what to do.

133
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:07,480
Speaker 0: I'm in this village- I didn't have problems with Quest for Glory.

134
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:08,151
Speaker 1: Yes, you did.

135
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:09,327
Speaker 0: You're like- It's a point-and-click adventure.

136
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:10,759
Speaker 0: You click on the guy, you talk to him.

137
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,837
Speaker 1: Yes, and I remember you saying specifically, "I didn't know what to do or where to go,".

138
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:15,480
Speaker 1: and then I gave up.

139
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,600
Speaker 1: Well,

140
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:23,381
Speaker 0: yeah, I went around the whole town and talked to everyone, and there was no hint as to what my quest was or anything or any, like, you know, usually when you play that kind of game, it's like- You know,

141
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,074
Speaker 1: if you talk to the adventurer guy, he's like, "Want a

142
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:26,576
Speaker 1: quest?".

143
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:30,722
Speaker 0: Great.

144
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:35,951
Speaker 0: But I played Fallout 1 again recently, and I got out, and I killed a bunch of rats.

145
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:36,632
Speaker 0: That was okay.

146
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:41,140
Speaker 0: I went out, and I started walking to go somewhere.

147
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,801
Speaker 0: You know, I said,

148
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:41,962
Speaker 0: "Okay.".

149
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:46,478
Speaker 0: I had to go to the west something something, and then it was just like I couldn't- and I died.

150
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:46,920
Speaker 0: It sucked.

151
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,060
Speaker 0: So I don't know why people like these games, because I don't think they're that good.

152
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:50,639
Speaker 1: I like them.

153
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:55,088
Speaker 0: I think it's the situation where it's like open-endedness is cool, right?

154
00:07:55,148 --> 00:08:01,860
Speaker 0: And the idea of open-endedness is awesome, but it usually results in bad game, because there's not enough direction.

155
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:08,639
Speaker 0: See, I guess for me, with Fallout- You just get lost, and you don't have any motivation or care, and then you die, and then it sucks.

156
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,563
Speaker 1: Like, I didn't have this problem.

157
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,068
Speaker 1: Now, a lot of games have this problem.

158
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:16,240
Speaker 1: Like, Grand Theft Auto, after I shot everyone in town, I got, like, I had no reason to play.

159
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:24,080
Speaker 0: You know, I barely played the newer 3D Grand Theft Autos, but in playing the old 2D Grand Theft Autos, I never had that problem.

160
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Speaker 1: See, in the 3D one, I actually had a lot of fun, but only by entering the "give everyone guns and make them pissed off" code.

161
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:36,460
Speaker 1: But with Fallout, the game was great, and I had no trouble thinking of where to go and exploring and enjoying myself.

162
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:47,380
Speaker 1: The only trouble I have is that the game was good for the time, but like many old, dossy games, it is unplayable in the modern world.

163
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,542
Speaker 1: Like, it is a game.

164
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:54,640
Speaker 1: that is the way it is because gaming was the way it was back then, and gaming like that cannot be done today.

165
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,520
Speaker 1: And that game, if you gave that to a kid today, they wouldn't even know it was a game.

166
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:00,349
Speaker 1: They would be like, "What do I do?

167
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:00,974
Speaker 1: What the fuck is

168
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:01,216
Speaker 1: this?".

169
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:06,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't really take too much of that, especially like the bad user interfaces.

170
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,760
Speaker 0: It's like, I remember back at RIT, I tried to play some Baldur's Gate game or something, right?

171
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,040
Speaker 0: And it had like, it was okay, I was actually having a good time.

172
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,560
Speaker 0: Walk around, it's a little bit of D&D, Forgotten Realms, whatever the hell it was, I don't know.

173
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,520
Speaker 1: I believe you mean Forgotten Realms.

174
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,340
Speaker 0: Right, that's what I tried to say.

175
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,839
Speaker 0: You know, talk to a wizard, go around- Put on a robe and wizard hat.

176
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:34,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, go around, use my, you know, thieving skills to steal stuff from people's houses, you know, that sort of stuff.

177
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:35,965
Speaker 0: And it was actually cool.

178
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:39,560
Speaker 0: how like, it sort of, it was almost D&D-ish.

179
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,280
Speaker 0: Like, if you stole, the police would, the guards would show up, right?

180
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,778
Speaker 0: And it was actually like, "Hey, this game is pretty

181
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:46,080
Speaker 0: smart.".

182
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,020
Speaker 0: But as soon as he got into a fight, it was like turn-based combat, but it wasn't actually pausing between the turns.

183
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:59,520
Speaker 0: So it's like you had to like, constantly pause and unpause, and the interface of it was just so painful, I quit immediately.

184
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,099
Speaker 0: And I died, first of all, some spiders killed me.

185
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,020
Speaker 0: So I came back and I went in there, and the spiders killed me immediately again.

186
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:09,115
Speaker 0: And I was just like, "Well, all my stuff is in

187
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:09,356
Speaker 0: there.".

188
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,640
Speaker 0: And they told me to go in there and fight the spiders, so shouldn't I be powerful enough to fight them now and not get killed in one hit?

189
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,880
Speaker 1: Did you ever fall into that trap that I remember when I was a kid, and I first got, not Chrono Trigger, but Legend of Mana?

190
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:28,540
Speaker 0: And this wasn't even like a cave, or a dungeon, this was the shed behind the lady's house that had a spider problem.

191
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,559
Speaker 1: No, but did you fall into the trap of, "Maybe it's one of those fights that's scripted where I'm supposed to die and then the plot

192
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:33,840
Speaker 1: happens.".

193
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:41,620
Speaker 0: No, I thought I was supposed to win, and I always just got killed, and I actually died, and I actually came back into the game, and my dead body was in there.

194
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,260
Speaker 1: I remember Legend of Mana, like a difficult boss, I was like, "Oh, I'm supposed to die, I get

195
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,320
Speaker 1: it.".

196
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,931
Speaker 1: And then I died, it was game over, and I'm like, "What?

197
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:50,779
Speaker 1: Oh my god, this game is gonna be

198
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:51,060
Speaker 1: hard.".

199
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:52,423
Speaker 1: I never beat that game.

200
00:10:52,443 --> 00:11:00,740
Speaker 1: But anyway, some games, like XCOM, barely, the goodness of that game barely overcomes the interface.

201
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,560
Speaker 1: The interface is almost unplayable.

202
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,540
Speaker 0: Well, actually, I realized, I always had trouble playing XCOM, even though I liked the idea of it.

203
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,100
Speaker 1: Well, let me put it this way, the interface is counterintuitive.

204
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,260
Speaker 0: Right, because the interface was terrible, and I realized in my most recent playing of XCOM that I didn't know what most of the buttons did.

205
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,259
Speaker 0: So I'm like, "Okay, Rem, just tell me what all the buttons

206
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:19,380
Speaker 0: do.".

207
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,180
Speaker 0: And as soon as I was told what all the buttons did, I can actually play XCOM pretty well now.

208
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,880
Speaker 1: However, I know that it took a good 15 minutes to explain what all the buttons were, which, maybe that's a problem.

209
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,579
Speaker 0: No, it is quite a problem, yes.

210
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:37,820
Speaker 0: Anyway, so... Not to mention the fact that if you made the game now, you could easily make the interface much better.

211
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:40,640
Speaker 1: Oh my god, XCOM needs an interface.

212
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:46,040
Speaker 1: Of all the games that need a remake, there were remakes of XCOM.

213
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:47,700
Speaker 1: They're almost all terrible.

214
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,060
Speaker 1: They just need to take the original XCOM and just remake it times a thousand.

215
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:55,819
Speaker 1: That game would satisfy me for like a year or two.

216
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got enough games right now that I don't need anymore.

217
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:00,839
Speaker 0: For a long while.

218
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:10,220
Speaker 1: I'm holding this Fallout puppet in my hand, and I gotta point out that the people who sent this Fallout puppet to me, which, by the way, was the Gothfather from the forums, but it wasn't really him.

219
00:12:10,782 --> 00:12:11,799
Speaker 1: It was him by proxy.

220
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,180
Speaker 1: It was Kristin, his fiancé, who acquired this puppet at PAX.

221
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,800
Speaker 1: And by the way, we met the Gothfather.

222
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,359
Speaker 1: These people were totally cool.

223
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:28,919
Speaker 1: We hung out with them before the Beyond Dungeons and Dragons panel in line, and I kinda wish we'd been able to hang out with them more at the con, but I imagine we will see you guys at the next PAX.

224
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,474
Speaker 0: Is, pexis.

225
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:33,440
Speaker 1: P-A-C-E-S is the way you spell it.

226
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,920
Speaker 1: But anyway, they did not just send the Fallout puppet.

227
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:39,740
Speaker 1: And they did not even expect anything in return.

228
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,420
Speaker 1: But first, this box comes, and it's gigantic.

229
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,760
Speaker 1: And I'm like, okay.

230
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:46,560
Speaker 0: Is that puppet bigger than I remember?

231
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,239
Speaker 1: The puppet is pretty big.

232
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:51,000
Speaker 1: And it's surprising how emotive it is.

233
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:54,560
Speaker 1: I've been playing with it a lot, and I wanna do something on the internet.

234
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,778
Speaker 0: Grim likes putting his hands up the little boy's bottom.

235
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,015
Speaker 1: He's not a little boy.

236
00:12:59,035 --> 00:12:59,238
Speaker 1: Anyway.

237
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:00,812
Speaker 1: I mean, look.

238
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:01,720
Speaker 1: Look around my room.

239
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,976
Speaker 1: I have more stuffed animals than you'd expect from a 26-year-old guy.

240
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,280
Speaker 0: I have more than you.

241
00:13:06,383 --> 00:13:07,360
Speaker 1: I don't think you do anymore.

242
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:08,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

243
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,159
Speaker 1: I have the Cactuar.

244
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,360
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I have more high-quality stuffed animals.

245
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:12,917
Speaker 0: No, you don't.

246
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:14,980
Speaker 1: Uh, Baby Dragon.

247
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:16,779
Speaker 0: I won.

248
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,696
Speaker 1: Tachikoma.

249
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,368
Speaker 1: Cactuar.

250
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:20,899
Speaker 1: I think I win.

251
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,379
Speaker 0: Nah, I got Cthulhu.

252
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Cthulhu's not in your room.

253
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,239
Speaker 0: I got Boo.

254
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:26,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have that Boo.

255
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,300
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

256
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,620
Speaker 1: I got the 1-Up Mushroom, though.

257
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,580
Speaker 0: I got a Charmander.

258
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,900
Speaker 1: Did not just include the Fallout Puppet.

259
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,820
Speaker 1: There was MapQuest Directions from where it was shipped.

260
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,959
Speaker 1: Well, from PAX, to Chico.

261
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,259
Speaker 1: But I'll get to what Chico is.

262
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:42,400
Speaker 1: And then, to the Geek House.

263
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,820
Speaker 1: And there's a little note, just in case he gets lost on the way.

264
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,151
Speaker 1: Carrot 3, Kristen.

265
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:52,780
Speaker 1: That's adorable.

266
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:54,939
Speaker 1: So, that's not all.

267
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Speaker 1: There's a postcard from Chico.

268
00:13:57,722 --> 00:14:03,060
Speaker 1: There's a collection of ultra-fancy Sierra Nevada Mustards.

269
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:04,720
Speaker 0: I don't like mustard.

270
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,880
Speaker 1: Well, that's 'cause you're stupid.

271
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,840
Speaker 1: And this is to me, not you.

272
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,698
Speaker 0: Why do they give ketchups?

273
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:09,680
Speaker 1: I'll get to that.

274
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,860
Speaker 1: See, I'm getting to a lot of things.

275
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,220
Speaker 1: But also included was something that I'm intrigued and frightened by.

276
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,376
Speaker 1: It is TJ Farms Kiwi Hot Pepper Jam.

277
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:23,099
Speaker 1: And I look inside...

278
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,939
Speaker 0: Hot Pepper Jam?

279
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,479
Speaker 1: Kiwi Hot Pepper Jam.

280
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:25,900
Speaker 1: Ingredients.

281
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:29,200
Speaker 1: Kiwi, sugar, vinegar, red pepper.

282
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:31,779
Speaker 0: And jam.

283
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,339
Speaker 1: Well, it is jam.

284
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,759
Speaker 1: But the note basically explained that because I "like to put weird shit on my sandwiches,".

285
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:40,859
Speaker 1: here is some weird shit to put on my sandwiches.

286
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,198
Speaker 0: Well, you do.

287
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,119
Speaker 0: Maybe you should put that on... Actually, that could go on a grilled cheese.

288
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:45,958
Speaker 0: Grilled cheese?

289
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:49,220
Speaker 1: I'm thinking of putting it on the sandwich I had today, which is a toasted bologna.

290
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:51,680
Speaker 0: Not feeling that.

291
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:56,400
Speaker 1: Also included is something that almost made me sick because I ate all of them within about 30 seconds.

292
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,620
Speaker 1: It was like cinnamon, sugar, and honey-covered almonds.

293
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,140
Speaker 0: Oh, I've had shit like that before.

294
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, but all of those together I've never had on one almond.

295
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,820
Speaker 0: No, you can get those at the Adams, I think, across the river.

296
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,419
Speaker 1: See, I've seen honey-covered almonds.

297
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,739
Speaker 1: I've seen cinnamon-covered almonds.

298
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,120
Speaker 1: I've never seen cinnamon, honey, sugar-covered almonds.

299
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,699
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I actually had some.

300
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:23,640
Speaker 1: Last, and certainly not least, a multitude of t-shirts from Chico State, founded in 1887.

301
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,020
Speaker 1: Chico State, apparently, was for many years Playboys' Party College of America.

302
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,292
Speaker 0: Why do you guys go to a party college?

303
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:32,780
Speaker 0: Don't you want jobs and money?

304
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:42,380
Speaker 1: All I have to say is this care package that came with the Fallout Puppet went above and beyond the call of duty.

305
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:44,720
Speaker 1: And my hat is off to you.

306
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:45,660
Speaker 0: Call of the duty.

307
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,300
Speaker 1: All I have to say is I- Call of the duty.

308
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:50,539
Speaker 1: That was awful.

309
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:53,398
Speaker 1: That was utterly, utterly awful.

310
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,060
Speaker 1: I don't know what I can say to that.

311
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,699
Speaker 0: That is the point.

312
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,700
Speaker 1: Seriously, you guys are awesome to a degree that I really can't begin to express.

313
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,760
Speaker 1: I will talk more about you in the future.

314
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,698
Speaker 1: And if anyone says, "Hey, Rim, have you sold

315
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:06,940
Speaker 1: out?".

316
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:09,120
Speaker 1: I've totally sold out to these two people.

317
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,600
Speaker 0: Well, I think what they've done here is they've sort of set the standard.

318
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:15,067
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

319
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:17,297
Speaker 1: Is this the standard for bribing Rim and Scott?

320
00:16:17,357 --> 00:16:17,960
Speaker 1: Or at least Rim?

321
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,952
Speaker 0: No, it's not a bribing standard.

322
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,447
Speaker 1: It's just a- I haven't been bribed.

323
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:22,240
Speaker 1: I will do almost anything you guys ask.

324
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,246
Speaker 0: It's the standard of cool.

325
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:25,096
Speaker 0: It's like, "Well, they are obviously

326
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:25,418
Speaker 0: cool."

327
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:29,680
Speaker 0: If you're cool, that means you can do as good as or better than that.

328
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,780
Speaker 0: If you do worse than that, we're going to look down on you.

329
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,775
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, Scott, but do as-.

330
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,323
Speaker 0: It's a bar.

331
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:34,820
Speaker 0: It's been set, and it will be raised.

332
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,640
Speaker 1: But, Scott, the implication here is that do as good or better than the bar.

333
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:40,659
Speaker 1: The bar is giving us stuff.

334
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:41,800
Speaker 0: Yeah.

335
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:46,060
Speaker 1: So, there's some implicit demand hidden in all that.

336
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,868
Speaker 0: Well, no, you don't have to give us stuff, but if you're going to do- If you're going to- If you're going to do something, it doesn't have to be giving us stuff, but if you do something, it has to be.

337
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:55,960
Speaker 0: that's the awesome level you're going for.

338
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,990
Speaker 1: But anyway, Kristen is also the co-host.

339
00:16:58,011 --> 00:16:59,819
Speaker 1: This is actually totally- Reverse Limbo.

340
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:05,140
Speaker 1: Of This Modern Death, Welcome to the Dark Side of Gaming, and I'm totally plugging that right now.

341
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,711
Speaker 0: All right.

342
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:10,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm totally sending them a Geek Nights care package in return.

343
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:18,999
Speaker 1: The problem is I don't have enough Geek Nights stuff, and there isn't really enough Beacon stuff unless I go to the Beacon Barkery to send back.

344
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,669
Speaker 0: You'd be like, "Here's a Geek Nights

345
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:20,911
Speaker 0: t-shirt.".

346
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,007
Speaker 0: I guess I could sign it.

347
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:23,934
Speaker 1: I could send a poster.

348
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:24,680
Speaker 1: I could sign that.

349
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:26,787
Speaker 0: Here's a map.

350
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:28,620
Speaker 0: so the Geek Nights t-shirt doesn't get lost.

351
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,580
Speaker 1: I could send one of our old microphones and sign it, but they're terrible microphones.

352
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,360
Speaker 1: We bought a Radio Shack.

353
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,237
Speaker 0: You don't want those.

354
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:34,897
Speaker 0: Yeah.

355
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:35,658
Speaker 0: Just throw them out.

356
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,258
Speaker 1: Well, one of them smells kind of bad.

357
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:38,980
Speaker 0: Well, what do you want?

358
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,739
Speaker 1: Well, after Scott did something to it.

359
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,388
Speaker 0: Nah.

360
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,339
Speaker 1: And other things.

361
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:46,480
Speaker 1: If you listen to an old episode of Geek Nights, I won't say which one.

362
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,759
Speaker 1: You'll hear on the air when Scott did that thing.

363
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,200
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's all I have to say about that.

364
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,680
Speaker 1: I do this in lieu of gaming news because- Oh, in lieu of gaming news?

365
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,429
Speaker 1: Well, for me, because what am I going to say?

366
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,320
Speaker 1: I'm done with Team Fortress 2 for real?

367
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:00,459
Speaker 0: Well, you are.

368
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:01,260
Speaker 1: I actually am.

369
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,859
Speaker 0: Of course you're lying because you played again and again and you were trying to get me to play it again and I was done with it a long time ago.

370
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,368
Speaker 1: I'm fine.

371
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:07,840
Speaker 1: Here's the news.

372
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,579
Speaker 1: I'm actually done with Team Fortress 2 and here's why.

373
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:12,927
Speaker 1: I said I was done with it a bunch of times.

374
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:16,320
Speaker 1: I had all these reasons, but I actually got a couple emails from people.

375
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,360
Speaker 1: Basically, they weren't saying I was wrong about Team Fortress 2.

376
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,378
Speaker 1: They were calling bullshit on the fact that the game is so easy and that I'm so good at it.

377
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,300
Speaker 1: So I played it until I think I'm absolutely as good as you could possibly be at it and now I'm done.

378
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:40,340
Speaker 1: So if anyone wants to challenge me, I'll set up some 3v3, maybe some 6v6, forum only, but other than that, this game is done and I've transcended it.

379
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:42,500
Speaker 0: I'll just be playing natural selection like I've been playing.

380
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:50,840
Speaker 1: I've been playing natural selection all week and in fact, when the presidential debate begins tonight, I'm going to be skulking during it and watching it.

381
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:52,760
Speaker 0: I'll just be skulking and not watching.

382
00:18:52,780 --> 00:19:00,120
Speaker 1: In fact, because I have the mixer set up, maybe I will pump key presidential debate items into it to confuse people while I bite them.

383
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:03,740
Speaker 0: Maybe I will just bite people and not pay any attention.

384
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,160
Speaker 1: Well, maybe while you're biting, you might hear Barack Obama saying something inspiring.

385
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,435
Speaker 0: Then maybe I'll bite him.

386
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:16,220
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm kind of rambling here, so what do you got in actual gaming news?

387
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,652
Speaker 0: Well, we can talk about gaming news, right?

388
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:18,620
Speaker 0: We haven't done it in a while.

389
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,917
Speaker 0: You can't talk about anything but the DSI.

390
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,583
Speaker 1: No, I guess you can't.

391
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:31,339
Speaker 1: Two weeks before the news came out and I noticed that a lot of people were calling bullshit on it.

392
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was calling half bullshit on it.

393
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:34,699
Speaker 0: I wasn't sure.

394
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:44,540
Speaker 1: I wasn't because the source that broke the news, I did a little bit of research and they have broken two other similar news ahead of time and been right.

395
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:45,856
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

396
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:48,374
Speaker 1: That's all I got to go on, but I believed it.

397
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:49,380
Speaker 1: I just thought it was stupid.

398
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:54,119
Speaker 0: Well, basically what they're going to do is Nintendo is coming out with the DSi.

399
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,193
Speaker 0: Obviously, it's the next generation of the Nintendo DS, right?

400
00:19:58,635 --> 00:19:59,660
Speaker 0: It has two cameras.

401
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,263
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait.

402
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,190
Speaker 1: What about the third pillar?

403
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:02,500
Speaker 1: Where's my next Game Boy?

404
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:09,052
Speaker 0: Basically, what it is, right, is it's got bigger screens.

405
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:11,280
Speaker 0: It's smaller, whatever, right?

406
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:17,200
Speaker 0: It looks a lot like the DS Lite, except there's a camera on the back of it, right?

407
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,420
Speaker 0: So, if your friend is sitting across from you, that camera points at them.

408
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,580
Speaker 0: It has a camera in the middle facing at you, so you can actually be cameraing whatever's in front of you and yourself at the same time.

409
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:37,940
Speaker 0: I don't know if at the same time, but it makes it easy to do webcams of yourself, but also to take pictures of things.

410
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:45,600
Speaker 1: Now, I'm not going to make a joke about this because it's not funny, but they've added a camera to a Nintendo product, a Nintendo DS.

411
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,540
Speaker 1: Now, there was a camera for the old Game Boy whatever.

412
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Game Boy camera for the original Game Boy.

413
00:20:51,354 --> 00:20:52,260
Speaker 0: It had a printer, too.

414
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,044
Speaker 1: Yes, and you know what?

415
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:55,320
Speaker 1: It was terrible, but a lot of people bought it.

416
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:56,844
Speaker 1: It was really cool.

417
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:58,270
Speaker 1: It was terrible, but you know what?

418
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:00,680
Speaker 1: I won't pretend that I didn't want one desperately.

419
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:07,360
Speaker 1: I didn't want one that badly, but I remember- I wanted it with the same gusto that I wanted, that TV tuner for the Game Gear.

420
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:14,440
Speaker 0: But I remember I got the Super Mario Brothers Deluxe, the greatest version of Super Mario Brothers ever released, for the Game Boy Color.

421
00:21:14,822 --> 00:21:17,657
Speaker 0: And it had special features for the printer and such, and I was like, "Aw,

422
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:18,019
Speaker 0: man.".

423
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,386
Speaker 1: But I point out something horrible.

424
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:34,680
Speaker 1: You realize that what Nintendo has done is that the next time- People aren't going to be pictochatting anymore, and the joke is dictochat, but it's just going to be actual pictures of people's genitalia as opposed to simply crude representations.

425
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,857
Speaker 0: And it's going to be a lot of kids that are going to see inappropriate children's genitalia.

426
00:21:40,877 --> 00:21:41,660
Speaker 0: It's not going to be good.

427
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,420
Speaker 0: You realize you're going to go to some gaming content.

428
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:45,587
Speaker 1: Maybe not PAX.

429
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:51,680
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, it's definitely PAX, but at least there- Some guy's going to go in the bathroom and go click, click, click, and then everyone's going to see it.

430
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,102
Speaker 1: Bathroom.

431
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:54,032
Speaker 1: Geek light in the pocket.

432
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,480
Speaker 1: DSI in the pants.

433
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:56,722
Speaker 0: Great.

434
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:00,400
Speaker 0: Rem's got the whole strategy figured out to show the world his dicks.

435
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,601
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

436
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:05,480
Speaker 1: You realize that in order to combat these problems, you must become the source of the problems.

437
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,871
Speaker 1: You must become the 14 to 99-year-old male and what they are thinking.

438
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:17,080
Speaker 1: Where they are presented with a camera and a semi-anonymous means of distributing photographs.

439
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:29,460
Speaker 0: You know, it's weird though, is that, you know, with like, iPhones have cameras, but you don't see this sort of stuff happening because it's, you know, the only way you can distribute your photos is with like Flickr or something where it's attached to you and an account and such.

440
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:37,860
Speaker 0: But this is a way for people to like, you know, share, uh, you know, pictures anonymously in sort of real time nearby.

441
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:42,840
Speaker 0: And we'll see exactly how they regulate the picture thingy, but it could be dangerous.

442
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:49,180
Speaker 1: Well, part of what I thought, I realized something, the reason there's so many penises in Pictochat, like I came up with actually a really good reason.

443
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:56,940
Speaker 1: Now granted, this ignores the fact that penises appear in every possible, any, I mean, look, look at how many penis creatures there are in Spore.

444
00:22:57,561 --> 00:23:01,319
Speaker 1: If there's any way to interact with something, someone will try to make a penis out of it.

445
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:09,640
Speaker 1: But I realized whenever I use Pictochat, it's actually so difficult, unless you are an artist, to do anything worthwhile in it.

446
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,372
Speaker 1: You can't actually have a conversation.

447
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:12,460
Speaker 1: It's impossible.

448
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:19,240
Speaker 1: You can't actually in any way impart anything meaningful to anyone unless you are an artist taking turns drawing art at each other.

449
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,700
Speaker 0: Or unless you do it really slowly.

450
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,211
Speaker 1: But then it doesn't work.

451
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:23,160
Speaker 1: It's not actually worthwhile.

452
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,180
Speaker 0: You're better off talking.

453
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:27,240
Speaker 1: But you can draw a penis in like two seconds.

454
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:28,299
Speaker 0: Yep.

455
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:29,646
Speaker 1: But I think that's it.

456
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,440
Speaker 1: And if you can take a picture of a penis, well, that's even faster.

457
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:50,880
Speaker 0: I mean, some people say that the reason, you know, for AOL speak, you know, and all the mistypings and shortenings and using like the letter B, you know, the letter B, the number four and then the letter U instead of, you know, actually spelling out before you and stuff like that is because people don't know how to type.

458
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:57,700
Speaker 0: So in order to speed up their communication, you know, when someone talks, you know, on a phone, they just talk as fast as they can.

459
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,083
Speaker 0: It's the same as talking in real life.

460
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:06,960
Speaker 0: But when they're typing, if you're typing skills are limited, you're going to be inefficient at typing and the communication is going to feel slow and frustrating.

461
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,740
Speaker 0: And thus you will, you know, change, you know, and your spelling and whatnot in order to speed it up to where it's tolerable.

462
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:18,840
Speaker 0: And I think that picked a chat is just intolerable unless you're communicating really stupid shit.

463
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:26,780
Speaker 0: And thus, you know, the medium defines the message and the message becomes stupid because that's the only message that people feel good about communicating through that medium.

464
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:36,680
Speaker 1: The term we were given, well, one of the terms that's related to this that I was given in one of my classes at RIT a long time ago about user interaction with stuff, it's an affordance.

465
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:44,180
Speaker 1: You have been afforded the ability to communicate very crude genitalia at one another, but you have been given really no other ability.

466
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,060
Speaker 1: So thus, the only thing people do is present crudely drawn genitalia to one another.

467
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,481
Speaker 0: All right.

468
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:51,187
Speaker 0: So the DSI, right, it's going to play DS games.

469
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:56,280
Speaker 1: They took out the GBA slot, which no one would have not seen this coming.

470
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Speaker 1: And notice how every iteration of these Nintendo products cuts out like the furthest back compatible.

471
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,376
Speaker 0: Well, actually, no, look, look, the Game Boy, original Game Boy.

472
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:05,637
Speaker 0: Right.

473
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:05,899
Speaker 0: OK.

474
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,665
Speaker 0: Then the Game Boy Color.

475
00:25:07,705 --> 00:25:09,875
Speaker 0: But they were so worried about backwards competitive.

476
00:25:09,895 --> 00:25:10,940
Speaker 0: This is where this is how.

477
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,985
Speaker 0: Let me tell you, this is how Nintendo learned their lesson.

478
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:13,246
Speaker 0: Right.

479
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:17,518
Speaker 0: Game Boy Color had backwards compatibility with the Game Boy 100 percent.

480
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:25,900
Speaker 0: They came out with and they they said you can make games that are DX games, DX games would work with the old Game Boy.

481
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,040
Speaker 0: But they would also work with the Game Boy Color and have better color on those.

482
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:35,520
Speaker 0: But then there were Game Boy Color only games that had even better color, but weren't backwards compatible.

483
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:47,460
Speaker 0: Most companies opted to make DX games, and very few people felt the need to upgrade to the Game Boy Color because the advantages of the Game Boy Color weren't that great.

484
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,480
Speaker 0: There were very few Game Boy Color only games, even though I bought the Game Boy Color and had a bunch of those games.

485
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:57,331
Speaker 1: I think a big part of it was just that the Game Boy Color wasn't better enough.

486
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:00,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, the color was basically not color.

487
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:02,727
Speaker 0: So they came out with the Game Boy Advance.

488
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:05,720
Speaker 0: The Game Boy Advance could play every Game Boy game ever.

489
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:09,432
Speaker 0: But Game Boy Advance games were just so far superior.

490
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:09,934
Speaker 0: Right.

491
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:11,720
Speaker 0: The people ended up mostly playing those.

492
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:13,564
Speaker 0: And the SP was the same way.

493
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:14,888
Speaker 0: The SP could play everything.

494
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,660
Speaker 0: But the Game Boy Micro, it could only play GBA games.

495
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,400
Speaker 0: They couldn't play GBA or Game Boy or Game Boy Color games or anything.

496
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:32,980
Speaker 1: Man, I feel like the Game Boy Micro was really cool, but there was never a point in my gaming cycle where it would have ever been a worthwhile product.

497
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,501
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

498
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:39,600
Speaker 0: I like it that it's so small, and I kind of would want one just because I like the hardware.

499
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:42,694
Speaker 0: But it only plays GBA games, and that's it.

500
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:44,040
Speaker 0: That's kind of useless.

501
00:26:44,261 --> 00:26:51,280
Speaker 1: If it had come out like a year, maybe, yeah, about a year earlier, even if it had cost like twice as much, I might have just bought it.

502
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:56,420
Speaker 0: If it played Game Boy Color and Game Boy games, I would totally buy one.

503
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,752
Speaker 1: Even though you'd have a cartridge bigger than it sticking out of it.

504
00:26:58,772 --> 00:26:59,456
Speaker 0: That's fine.

505
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,119
Speaker 0: That's fine.

506
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:05,980
Speaker 0: And then the DS came out, and the DS could also only play GBA games, but also DS games, obviously.

507
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,796
Speaker 0: The DSi only plays DS games, but it has like an SD slot.

508
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:12,900
Speaker 0: apparently, they say?

509
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:14,119
Speaker 1: Yes, they say.

510
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:31,580
Speaker 0: And you put something in a DS slot, and then you can go and basically, much like WiiWare or the Nintendo Wii store, you can go to the DSi store, buy games online, and download them onto your SD card, and then play them off of the card.

511
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:37,140
Speaker 0: And they're going to make DSi only online games that you can buy and play on there.

512
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:39,113
Speaker 0: And that's pretty enticing.

513
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:40,060
Speaker 0: I like that action.

514
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:46,357
Speaker 1: Basically, if I weren't as cynical as I am, I would have said, "This is it.

515
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:47,280
Speaker 1: This is it.

516
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:58,578
Speaker 1: Finally, I can just download games to my DS, and I don't have to worry about buying cartridges, and everything's going to be digital, and I'll just use my Nintendo points to do everything, and I'll synchronize it with my Wii, and everything awesome is going to

517
00:27:58,618 --> 00:27:58,859
Speaker 1: happen.".

518
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:06,480
Speaker 1: But I know Nintendo's going to come up one dollar short, one foot behind, just short of glory, as they always do.

519
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:09,488
Speaker 0: Well, is the situation, right?

520
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:15,005
Speaker 0: It appears that, you know, this is going to be DS games still coming out, and DS games will work on everything, right?

521
00:28:15,105 --> 00:28:20,060
Speaker 0: But it looks like there are going to be DSi games on cartridge.

522
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:31,533
Speaker 0: At least that's what the sources are saying, and apparently those DSi games on cartridge, unlike DS games, if you buy a Japanese DS game and you play it, you can play it on any DS.

523
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:33,120
Speaker 0: Every DS works with every other DS.

524
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:43,200
Speaker 0: But DSi games are going to be region-locked, so you won't be able to buy a Japanese DSi game and play it on a US DSi if it's a cartridge game.

525
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,780
Speaker 1: But one of the best things about the Game Boys was that there was no region-locking.

526
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,460
Speaker 0: Actually, the old Game Boys, depending on which...

527
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,040
Speaker 1: Well, back then it didn't matter because you couldn't get the games anyway.

528
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, like, Australian people actually had a really hard time with old Game Boys.

529
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,615
Speaker 1: Have Australian people ever not had a really hard time with gaming?

530
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,729
Speaker 0: With DS, they don't have a problem.

531
00:29:01,749 --> 00:29:03,320
Speaker 0: With DS, everything is region-free.

532
00:29:03,782 --> 00:29:05,459
Speaker 0: Yes, but the games are still so expensive.

533
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,760
Speaker 0: Well, that's the problem of living on an island far away.

534
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,872
Speaker 1: Well, technically we live on a really big island far away.

535
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:14,540
Speaker 1: We also make everything here.

536
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,458
Speaker 0: Our island's big enough.

537
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:19,646
Speaker 0: But anyway, the DSi.

538
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:21,593
Speaker 0: What do I think about the DSi?

539
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:23,740
Speaker 0: It's not out yet, so I can't give some final opinion.

540
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:27,353
Speaker 0: I've bought every Nintendo portable so far.

541
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,880
Speaker 1: Remember, I was like 50/50 on if the DS was going to fail or not.

542
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,720
Speaker 0: I bought the Game Boy Color the day it came out, the Game Boy Advance the day it came out, and the DS the day it came out.

543
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,040
Speaker 0: I upgraded to a DS Lite way after the DS Lite came out.

544
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,675
Speaker 0: I never bought a Micro or an SP, even though we have them lying around.

545
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:49,000
Speaker 0: We have an SP lying around somewhere.

546
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,864
Speaker 1: But we only bought the DS.

547
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:57,600
Speaker 1: Part of the reason we bought it on opening day was that it's either going to be the next thing and it's going to be awesome, or it's going to be another Virtual Boy.

548
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,519
Speaker 0: And of course it was awesome.

549
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,059
Speaker 1: Yes, but it could have been a Virtual Boy.

550
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,140
Speaker 0: The thing about the DSi is that I have a lot of Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and DS games.

551
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:10,940
Speaker 0: And while I'd like to get in on this DSi action, my DS Lite is actually really new.

552
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:12,693
Speaker 0: I have like the Cobalt Blue one.

553
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:13,560
Speaker 0: I bought it that recently.

554
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,720
Speaker 0: And I don't really feel like replacing it when I have a lot of games still yet to play on it.

555
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:26,240
Speaker 0: And even though the DSi might have awesome, it's like great, now I'm going to have to carry more things around to be able to play all the games that I have.

556
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:38,820
Speaker 0: I guess if I had a DSi and I could somehow find an SP that is like brand new, the later edition SP that had the better screen, then I'd be able to have two things that play everything.

557
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,519
Speaker 0: And I guess that would be the best situation.

558
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:44,112
Speaker 0: Because I think the SP we have now is one of the old SPs, the shit screen.

559
00:30:44,132 --> 00:30:45,236
Speaker 0: That's not worth it.

560
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,340
Speaker 0: I want one of the later SPs.

561
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:55,940
Speaker 0: But yeah, I think I'm just going to hold off on the DSi until it proves itself to be so amazing and so great that it has to pay it.

562
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,510
Speaker 0: Plus, they're talking a price that's close to $200.

563
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,456
Speaker 0: It's like, come on, an Xbox 360 is $200, right?

564
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,693
Speaker 0: You know, honestly, I think they said less than $190, which is like, uh-huh.

565
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:13,000
Speaker 1: My real feeling here, I mean, I have a lot to say about the DSi, but I'm going to wait until there's more news, maybe we'll see one, all that business.

566
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:18,020
Speaker 1: But it seems like it's really targeted more at the Japanese audience than the American audience.

567
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,380
Speaker 1: I feel like this is designed to cause everyone in Japan who plays Nintendo games to buy one.

568
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:27,556
Speaker 1: And then the one that's probably going to really get traction in the US will be the kind of DSi.

569
00:31:29,481 --> 00:31:31,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is indeed true.

570
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:33,771
Speaker 0: I mean, the DSi is coming out in Japan way before the US.

571
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,460
Speaker 0: I don't think we're even going to get it for much, you know, late middle of next year.

572
00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:46,640
Speaker 1: It seems like it's really just meant for the kinds of things that Japanese gamers and Japanese people do with gadgets much more than Americans do.

573
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:54,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, this could end up as one of those things like, you know, the Famicom disk system where it's a big hit in Japan and we just don't get it here because it's not for us.

574
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,132
Speaker 0: It's only for, you know, that other market.

575
00:31:57,494 --> 00:31:58,680
Speaker 0: Actually, that'd be okay with me.

576
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,684
Speaker 1: It's not for me yet.

577
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:06,920
Speaker 1: I imagine even if they have downloadable content, that's just like a big cash cow for them, as far as I can see.

578
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:16,020
Speaker 1: And I don't really want to start buying rehashes of games that I've already bought on the Wii and already bought, you know, five or six times throughout my life again just to have them on my DS.

579
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,021
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

580
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:28,960
Speaker 0: But yeah, Nintendo definitely learned its lesson back with the Game Boy Color that if you try to fool around with backwards compatibility and try to stick to it too much, then people don't go forward.

581
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:35,133
Speaker 0: And you have to sort of go forward and still have some backwards compatibility, but also not other.

582
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:38,640
Speaker 0: You know, you have to keep something and drop something to keep people going forward.

583
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,907
Speaker 0: Otherwise, they'll just, you know, hang back as where it's safe.

584
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:47,900
Speaker 0: And that's why that they've removed the GBA slot from the DSi because the lesson they learned with the Game Boy Color.

585
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,420
Speaker 0: And, you know, even though they learned a lesson and they're probably right business wise, they're not getting my money wise.

586
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,324
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

587
00:33:01,424 --> 00:33:04,554
Speaker 1: So I'll be honest, I hated Line Rider.

588
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:05,818
Speaker 1: I thought it was a terrible game.

589
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:06,460
Speaker 1: It wasn't fun.

590
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,825
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't really a game.

591
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:11,060
Speaker 0: It's a lot like MS Paint, only more specific.

592
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,881
Speaker 0: No, but not even.

593
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:13,644
Speaker 1: My problem is the people acted like.

594
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:14,887
Speaker 1: a lot of people really got into it.

595
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:22,360
Speaker 1: But basically all they would do is draw like the drawing was mostly unrelated to the line riding part.

596
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,340
Speaker 1: Like you make your line work and these drew all this unrelated stuff everywhere else.

597
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:31,732
Speaker 1: I saw very few line riders that took advantage of it, I guess, to the degree that it could have.

598
00:33:31,772 --> 00:33:33,838
Speaker 1: And I just I don't really understand the hype.

599
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:34,740
Speaker 1: I never liked it.

600
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,159
Speaker 1: I never saw anything in Line Rider that ever impressed me.

601
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:49,320
Speaker 0: I you know, some things it was basically I tried to do Line Rider a couple of times and it was so difficult that the fact that anyone actually got it to, you know, do stuff, you know, meant that they had a lot of patience and a lot of free

602
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:49,600
Speaker 1: time.

603
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,164
Speaker 1: Or that it was two unrelated things.

604
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:55,154
Speaker 1: Like you make a line rider work and then you draw a picture with this really simple program.

605
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:57,440
Speaker 1: I'd rather just go to like an Okaki board and watch what people do.

606
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,146
Speaker 1: But anyway, this made me like a line rider.

607
00:34:02,186 --> 00:34:03,929
Speaker 1: This is the real line rider.

608
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,875
Speaker 1: And I thought actually randomly the other day we were watching Xiao Xiao.

609
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:11,360
Speaker 1: Remember the old like stick people fighting Kung Fu?

610
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,264
Speaker 0: I don't know.

611
00:34:12,324 --> 00:34:14,060
Speaker 0: I don't know if people are old enough to remember this.

612
00:34:14,581 --> 00:34:17,933
Speaker 1: This was the biggest thing in the world back in the early days of the Internet.

613
00:34:17,953 --> 00:34:19,780
Speaker 1: I mean, like Stickdeath.com and all that.

614
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,909
Speaker 0: Stickdeath.com is classic.

615
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,540
Speaker 0: I was looking at that shit like 97.

616
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,844
Speaker 1: I know these things are terrible.

617
00:34:24,884 --> 00:34:26,969
Speaker 1: Like it's not like they don't hold up today.

618
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,179
Speaker 1: It's like you look at them and you're not even sure that they exist.

619
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,100
Speaker 1: It's kind of like you're looking at something so insignificant and so unentertaining.

620
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,284
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

621
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:36,520
Speaker 0: Stickdeath.com still exists.

622
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,308
Speaker 1: Yes, it does.

623
00:34:37,348 --> 00:34:38,300
Speaker 1: I was there this morning.

624
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,842
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

625
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:39,367
Speaker 0: Hold on.

626
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:41,139
Speaker 0: Archive one early gifts.

627
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:44,083
Speaker 1: Yes, all the ones that you remember are there.

628
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:54,820
Speaker 1: But anyway, someone took this kind of thing, the old Stickdeath style animation, whatever, and they combined it with Line Rider in a fairly clever way.

629
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,406
Speaker 1: And I found this mildly entertaining.

630
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,212
Speaker 1: That's all I really got to say.

631
00:34:58,252 --> 00:35:00,360
Speaker 1: So, Scott, what is your thing of the day?

632
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,587
Speaker 0: Well, it's basically just a picture.

633
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:04,232
Speaker 0: It's a simple picture.

634
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,340
Speaker 0: You know, someone painted it or drew it or whatever.

635
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:11,529
Speaker 0: And it's a little mashup of two nerdy things that people enjoy.

636
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:13,953
Speaker 0: But it is a humorous mashup.

637
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:16,077
Speaker 0: And it's just a picture.

638
00:35:16,117 --> 00:35:18,000
Speaker 0: You look at it, you laugh, you close the window.

639
00:35:18,622 --> 00:35:22,080
Speaker 1: It is extremely high quality and a little subtle, but not too subtle.

640
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:23,262
Speaker 0: It should be.

641
00:35:23,282 --> 00:35:28,539
Speaker 0: If you don't get the joke, you're not the kind of person that should be listening to the show.

642
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:30,041
Speaker 0: Right.

643
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,266
Speaker 1: But anyway, Via Paletti.

644
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:36,414
Speaker 1: Well, I guess we could count this as another Pax show now, because we've talked about Pax a bunch.

645
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,180
Speaker 1: And now we're going to talk about the game we found at Pax.

646
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,244
Speaker 0: Well, it's not a game we found at Pax.

647
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:45,635
Speaker 0: I knew about this game since 2002 when it won this field this year.

648
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:47,860
Speaker 0: That's when I found out about the game and I saw a picture of it.

649
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,870
Speaker 0: I said, wow, that game looks like a weird, you know, it doesn't.

650
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:55,520
Speaker 0: it doesn't look like Jenga, but it's a bunch of wooden pieces stacked up.

651
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,132
Speaker 0: So you say, ah, oh, and that probably plays somewhat similarly to Jenga.

652
00:36:00,232 --> 00:36:02,880
Speaker 1: I'm going to say something now and people might hate me, hate on me for it.

653
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,765
Speaker 1: Jenga is not a good game.

654
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:06,512
Speaker 0: No, it's really a terrible game.

655
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:08,820
Speaker 1: There are much better games that have the same mechanics.

656
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,209
Speaker 0: I mean, at least I mean, as a kid, we didn't actually play Jenga.

657
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:13,413
Speaker 0: We had Uno Jenga.

658
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:14,777
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't Uno Jenga.

659
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,719
Speaker 0: It was Uno Stacko.

660
00:36:16,222 --> 00:36:19,540
Speaker 0: It was similar to Jenga, except you didn't just pick a piece and move it up.

661
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:26,240
Speaker 0: If you rolled a die and if the number or the color match, you know, just like Uno, then you had to move that color piece up.

662
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,408
Speaker 0: So it had this sort of random element and it was.

663
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,313
Speaker 0: it was a little better than Jenga.

664
00:36:31,413 --> 00:36:33,700
Speaker 0: And sometimes you would roll and have to move two pieces at once.

665
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,461
Speaker 0: Oh, that was rough.

666
00:36:35,242 --> 00:36:48,620
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Via Paletti is a game and you look at it, you see a bunch of wooden rods, right, that are, you know, and you see plates, these weirdly shaped plates that are in between the rods, making this kind of weird tower.

667
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,702
Speaker 0: And you say, what's up with that?

668
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:52,647
Speaker 0: And I saw this game in O2.

669
00:36:52,728 --> 00:36:55,112
Speaker 0: It went to spiel this jar game of the year.

670
00:36:55,473 --> 00:37:00,001
Speaker 0: Best game pretty much in the whole world in the year of 2002.

671
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:02,547
Speaker 0: And I was like, what is so great about that game?

672
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,950
Speaker 0: There must be something great about it.

673
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,453
Speaker 0: But I never got the game.

674
00:37:05,493 --> 00:37:08,240
Speaker 0: I never investigated further until PAX.

675
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,884
Speaker 0: I saw it there and I said, you know what?

676
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:11,347
Speaker 0: All right, we're looking for a game to play.

677
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:16,820
Speaker 0: And I like to play new games because even if it's a bad game, I like learning new games.

678
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,866
Speaker 0: I like opening new boxes, seeing new pieces.

679
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:19,467
Speaker 0: Right.

680
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:22,054
Speaker 0: Rim doesn't like to waste time learning new games.

681
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:22,535
Speaker 0: He just want.

682
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,200
Speaker 0: he'd rather play a game he already knows.

683
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:32,080
Speaker 1: I'd rather exercise the competitive and strategic parts of my brain, other than the memorization and rules, remembering parts of my.

684
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,424
Speaker 0: Well, you do one and then the other.

685
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:37,055
Speaker 0: But anyway, Via Paletti was a game that I knew was a spiel this jar.

686
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:38,138
Speaker 0: I had never played.

687
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:38,800
Speaker 0: Right.

688
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:45,040
Speaker 0: And since I knew it was a Jenga type ish kind of game, I figured we'll be able to learn this really easily.

689
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,220
Speaker 0: And because Jenga ish type games are pretty impressive looking and they have a lot of suspense, you know, like topple even, you know, crappy old topple.

690
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:54,921
Speaker 0: Yeah.

691
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:57,327
Speaker 0: Even has suspense when it starts to wobble a whole bunch.

692
00:37:57,388 --> 00:38:00,034
Speaker 0: So, you know, it'll get a lot of attention.

693
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:02,120
Speaker 0: It'll be easy to find other players, et cetera.

694
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,245
Speaker 0: So I pulled it out of there.

695
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:03,888
Speaker 0: I said, we're doing it.

696
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:04,230
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

697
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:04,853
Speaker 0: We're doing it.

698
00:38:05,556 --> 00:38:06,058
Speaker 0: We pulled it out.

699
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:08,267
Speaker 0: Here are the rules of Via Paletti.

700
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:08,889
Speaker 0: Very simple.

701
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:09,110
Speaker 0: Right.

702
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:10,335
Speaker 0: That's they're so simple.

703
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,380
Speaker 0: I can tell you them on the show.

704
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:13,726
Speaker 0: I'm not going to go into great detail, but I'll tell you the basics.

705
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:15,290
Speaker 0: You have all these rods.

706
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,900
Speaker 0: There's four different colored rods, green, blue, red and yellow.

707
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,246
Speaker 0: OK, each player is a different color.

708
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:23,834
Speaker 0: If you have two players, each person takes two colors.

709
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:26,020
Speaker 0: If you have three players, neutral color, whatever.

710
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:30,611
Speaker 0: You put a plate on the color on top of all the rods on your turn.

711
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:34,560
Speaker 0: You take your rods and you want to bring them up on top.

712
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,406
Speaker 0: So all your rods are under these plates or at least on the lower level.

713
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:41,452
Speaker 0: Maybe the plate isn't covering them, you know, and you want to move them up.

714
00:38:41,472 --> 00:38:45,940
Speaker 0: because when your rods move up, whatever rods are on the top level, count for points.

715
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:49,929
Speaker 0: Whatever rods are not on the top level, don't count for points.

716
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:50,651
Speaker 0: All right.

717
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:54,260
Speaker 0: So you have one rod that's worth three points.

718
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:54,922
Speaker 0: It's a big one.

719
00:38:54,942 --> 00:38:59,620
Speaker 0: You have a rod that's worth two points, the hex, and you have three rods that are worth one point each five rods.

720
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:01,765
Speaker 0: So you want to move the big ones up first.

721
00:39:02,046 --> 00:39:04,592
Speaker 0: Right now, the big ones are, of course, heavier.

722
00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:08,020
Speaker 0: They're also have more surface area at the top and bottom.

723
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:15,860
Speaker 0: And remember the rods that you're moving from the bottom of the tower to the top of the tower are the same rods that are holding up the plates.

724
00:39:16,381 --> 00:39:24,440
Speaker 0: So it's not every rod is going to be able to get moved up because if you pull every rod out, the whole thing falls down and that's not what you lose.

725
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:25,121
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

726
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:27,586
Speaker 1: It seems to come down to at every level.

727
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:31,232
Speaker 1: You will have three pillars left or about.

728
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:35,340
Speaker 1: it seems like about a third of the time, they'll end up with like two pillars at the bottom.

729
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,191
Speaker 0: In the very first game we played, me, rim, and this other guy at PAX, right?

730
00:39:41,073 --> 00:39:42,576
Speaker 0: We got the thing, right?

731
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:44,320
Speaker 0: We were building and building and building and building.

732
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,014
Speaker 0: And we were on like the third plate because after you put up a bunch of rods, no one can move rods anymore.

733
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,860
Speaker 0: You start putting plates on top of the rods.

734
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,947
Speaker 0: And we were on like the third plate and the thing was getting crazy.

735
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:56,755
Speaker 0: And then I pulled the rod out from the lowest level.

736
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,480
Speaker 0: that wasn't pulled out earlier in the game.

737
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:05,680
Speaker 0: So now there are only two rods on the lowest level holding up this giant plate full of rods at the top of it.

738
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,620
Speaker 1: It was very frightening.

739
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,360
Speaker 0: It was very frightening and very suspenseful and very awesome.

740
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,434
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is definitely one of those tension followed by screaming games.

741
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:16,200
Speaker 1: And basically it'll be nothing but tension.

742
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:21,372
Speaker 1: And then the tension will either be punctuated by, "Oh my God, I can't believe you pulled that

743
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:21,592
Speaker 1: off!"

744
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:21,793
Speaker 1: or

745
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:22,535
Speaker 1: "AHHHHHHH!".

746
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:33,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the thing about this game is that, the bad thing about this game is that the rules aren't really, really specific.

747
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:36,060
Speaker 0: You sort of have to be fast and loose with it.

748
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,884
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, I feel like you could play it different ways.

749
00:40:38,924 --> 00:40:49,620
Speaker 1: I mean, the way I read the rules, if you just read them at face value, you can't so much as cause another thing, pillar to move, touch another pillar, anything.

750
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:53,210
Speaker 1: You pretty much have to play this game, like, solid.

751
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,800
Speaker 1: However, unless you're a surgeon, that's pretty much impossible.

752
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:01,160
Speaker 1: But you can pretty much just play, agree to a set of rules with your friends and run with it and never look back.

753
00:41:02,301 --> 00:41:07,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only other problem with this game is that the turn order actually matters a lot.

754
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Speaker 0: Like, whoever is the first person to put a rod on the, whoever gets to play the first person to put a rod on the green plate has a significant advantage in winning.

755
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:26,200
Speaker 0: Because it's going to be pretty much impossible for anyone to beat them and score until another plate shows up, unless they screw up or something.

756
00:41:26,941 --> 00:41:37,040
Speaker 0: And there's a good chance that the entire thing will fall over before the next plate shows up, and thus the odds of that person winning are very good.

757
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,520
Speaker 1: See, I don't think that's true among skilled players.

758
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:49,260
Speaker 0: No, not among skilled players, but I think, you know, in general, that is, being the first person to put a rod on a new plate has a significant advantage.

759
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,947
Speaker 1: See, because I feel like the strategy is very simple.

760
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:56,780
Speaker 1: The game goes between stable and unstable states, and what you want to do is you count ahead.

761
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,480
Speaker 1: You have to pay attention to the turn order and who is going to be able to move things up and who won't be.

762
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:10,380
Speaker 1: You have to position your pillars to try and prevent the people who would otherwise take the lead away from you from being able to, because they won't be able to place.

763
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,860
Speaker 1: They'll have to place the plate, and then you get to place the thing on top.

764
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:26,480
Speaker 1: And then you want to make sure that you want to actually make the thing really, really stable, unless you know that you're going to be the one, based on your previous positioning, to place the rod first on one of the big plates.

765
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:36,520
Speaker 1: And you try to, if you know that's going to happen, then you try to destabilize it, and then once you're in the lead, you basically try to make the thing fall over without actually making it fall over.

766
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:47,240
Speaker 0: Right, because if you have the high score at the present point in time, and you and someone else knocks it over, right, and if there's four players, that's three out of four people knock it over, you win.

767
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:57,720
Speaker 0: So if the thing is wobbly, right, and you're in the lead, you don't want to knock it over yourself, because then whoever was in the lead before you were in the lead is the winner.

768
00:42:58,221 --> 00:43:05,620
Speaker 0: But you want to keep it wobbly so that someone else will have a much greater chance of knocking it over, and thus giving you the victory.

769
00:43:06,221 --> 00:43:16,980
Speaker 0: But if you aren't in the lead, you want it to be super, super stable, unless it's only wobbly on the turn of the person in the lead, so they'll knock it over, and if you were in lead before them, you'll win.

770
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:25,019
Speaker 0: I don't know if that made a lot of sense, but basically, if you have the high score, it's in your interest to fuck it over and try to not get the thing to be unstable and bleh.

771
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,388
Speaker 0: Which, in some ways, is correct from a game perspective.

772
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:32,313
Speaker 0: There are three people trying to keep it stable, and one making it wobbly.

773
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:35,580
Speaker 0: It's probably going to end up stable, and it'll be okay.

774
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:42,097
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it's sort of more fun to build a crazy tall tower.

775
00:43:42,217 --> 00:43:43,060
Speaker 0: that's all insane.

776
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,579
Speaker 1: You keep saying that, but I win this game almost every time we play it.

777
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:48,179
Speaker 0: I won quite a few times.

778
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,184
Speaker 1: Not so many.

779
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,439
Speaker 1: I tend to win, because I tend to actually...

780
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,600
Speaker 0: I haven't even played it that many times.

781
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, we haven't, but I've won a good majority.

782
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,218
Speaker 0: Like two or three times.

783
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:14,000
Speaker 1: We've played it more than that, but anyway, the reason is, I actually pay attention to the strategy, and the game is actually kind of strategically deep, but if someone like Scott is trying to just build it tall, it's really easy for me to win, because I just get in the lead and then destabilize it, and then I win.

784
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:23,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is, you think the way to get in the lead is to move your bigger stuff to the top level, but everyone does that, so it's not really about...

785
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,359
Speaker 1: I don't always move my bigger stuff to the top level right away.

786
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:28,678
Speaker 0: Oh, you got to.

787
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:43,100
Speaker 1: No, sometimes I feel like I can stay behind, because you can use the bigger stuff and put it in a safe spot, and then not move it up right away, as long as you know it's still safe, protecting it with your little guys, and then you have it free after you've trapped someone else's.

788
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:49,400
Speaker 1: Or, you've got it now to use to destabilize the thing, or stabilize it at the proper moment.

789
00:44:49,760 --> 00:45:08,120
Speaker 0: That is one of the big key things about the game, is remember, someone's going to have to stay behind on the lower level, so you sort of, when you're putting your new guys up on the next plate, you want to put them sort of on top, so that they're putting a lot of weight onto someone else's pillars, so they won't be able to pull them out.

790
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:25,700
Speaker 0: But, you also want to keep the whole structure as a whole, you know, solid or unsolid, depending on your current status in the game, and those two things might be in conflict with each other, and you've got three people moving pillars up before it's your turn again, you don't know how it's going to go.

791
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:41,200
Speaker 0: You know, and sometimes, you know, you've got to leave, you can control, a lot of the plates are kind of small, so you can control where there's enough room to put something on the plate, you know, you crowd the plate out, and then, oh shit, there's nowhere for me to put anything on the plate, and good stuff like that.

792
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,503
Speaker 0: I don't know.

793
00:45:43,523 --> 00:45:43,964
Speaker 0: Anything else?

794
00:45:44,065 --> 00:45:49,980
Speaker 0: If you're playing, the game is really, really fun, I could play it like a bajillion, bajillion times.

795
00:45:50,801 --> 00:46:05,520
Speaker 1: I'll say this, even if you don't like the typical German board games we always talk about, this game is a thousand times more fun than Jenga, much quicker to set up and play, much quicker to tear down, this is like one of the best party games ever.

796
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:12,560
Speaker 1: Like if you've got, if you have friends, by Via Paletti, there will always be a time where you will have friends around who will want to play this game.

797
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:22,200
Speaker 1: I mean, a frat house, having this in the frat house, especially if you make it a drinking game, you replace the pillars with shot glasses or something, you know, tall shot glasses, you can have some fun.

798
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:36,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only problem is the game theoretically has a two player version, the problem with the two player version is that all the strategy of the score and everything like that is gone, and it's because there's only two people, it's whoever makes it fall over loses

799
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:37,440
Speaker 1: and the other person wins.

800
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:49,060
Speaker 1: I don't think that's a problem at all, it's just a different game, instead of worrying about, you know, this pillar is worth more points, you only worry about, I want to stabilize this pillar for me, and yet destabilize it for the other person.

801
00:46:49,060 --> 00:47:03,320
Speaker 0: I didn't say it's a problem, I just said it's a different game, and I feel like, you know, when, you know, Puerto Rico, even though it's a slightly different game, it's a completely different game, but it's not that completely different.

802
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:12,060
Speaker 0: This is like super completely different, it's like, you know, it's like change football to flag football, okay different, but football to baseball, completely different, right?

803
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:20,800
Speaker 0: So Puerto Rico 3 and 5 player are different the way flag football and football are different, but via Paletti, 4 and 2 player are different the way that football and baseball are different.

804
00:47:21,161 --> 00:47:22,360
Speaker 1: I don't think they're that different.

805
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,400
Speaker 0: I think they're pretty different.

806
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:37,940
Speaker 1: Because it really just comes down to you're free to place your, in fact, I think it's more fun in a lot of ways, because you're just free to use the weights of the pieces to your advantage in stabilizing and destabilizing and building, as opposed to also having to play this meta strategy game of the points.

807
00:47:39,842 --> 00:47:46,360
Speaker 1: I actually, I enjoy the 2 player game more and I wish I could take the fun of that and transfer it into the 3 and 4 player game better.

808
00:47:47,102 --> 00:47:50,400
Speaker 0: No, I like the 3 and 4 player game better with the point strategy and whatnot.

809
00:47:51,020 --> 00:48:04,480
Speaker 0: And the thing is in the 2 player game also the turn order matters a whole lot more, because, you know, there's only 2 people, so it's like whoever goes first is probably going to be the person who puts up the plate.

810
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:05,384
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

811
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:06,175
Speaker 1: Have you done your counting?

812
00:48:06,962 --> 00:48:10,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you both have, you know, 10 rods, right?

813
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

814
00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:15,640
Speaker 1: I'm just asking if you actually calculated or if you're just kind of shooting from the hip.

815
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,980
Speaker 0: No, I calculated.

816
00:48:18,302 --> 00:48:18,476
Speaker 1: Okay.

817
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,633
Speaker 0: Well, maybe if there's 3 rods left, then maybe...

818
00:48:23,102 --> 00:48:24,780
Speaker 1: Don't forget the neutral rod rules.

819
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,320
Speaker 0: That's only if there's 3 players and not 2 players.

820
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:28,913
Speaker 1: Well, 2 players, it doesn't matter.

821
00:48:28,953 --> 00:48:29,500
Speaker 1: You just play.

822
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,499
Speaker 1: No one has an advantage at all.

823
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:40,020
Speaker 0: Well, it depends, you know, if you're the person who has to put the plate, then the other person puts the first rod, and then they have a big advantage in the game, because...

824
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:40,865
Speaker 1: How do they have a big advantage?

825
00:48:40,905 --> 00:48:43,460
Speaker 1: I think putting the plate is a much bigger advantage than putting the first rod.

826
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,980
Speaker 0: Putting the plate is a big advantage, but...

827
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,340
Speaker 1: In the 2 player game, it is definitely more of an advantage.

828
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,478
Speaker 0: No, I think it's...

829
00:48:49,423 --> 00:48:49,545
Speaker 1: Why?

830
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:50,439
Speaker 1: Because points don't matter.

831
00:48:52,381 --> 00:48:52,644
Speaker 1: Why?

832
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:54,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't think this through.

833
00:48:54,702 --> 00:48:55,280
Speaker 0: It's alright.

834
00:48:55,461 --> 00:48:58,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're just gonna sidestep that?

835
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,639
Speaker 1: You know, the presidential debate is coming up, and I think Scott has learned much from it.

836
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,180
Speaker 1: I think perhaps that your performance is prescient of perhaps everything that's going to go on tonight.

837
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,380
Speaker 0: Well, you must enjoy my performance so much then, because you're gonna spend your time watching it.

838
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,009
Speaker 1: I'm not watching the debate tonight.

839
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:18,014
Speaker 1: I saw the format.

840
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:18,879
Speaker 1: This debate is a joke.

841
00:49:19,663 --> 00:49:21,040
Speaker 0: Well, that's what we were saying earlier.

842
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:22,600
Speaker 1: Until I saw the format.

843
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:30,460
Speaker 0: Anyway... I want to talk more about Villa Paletti, because I feel like we didn't say enough in this podcast, but there isn't that much more to say.

844
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,130
Speaker 1: Well, no, here's the next thing you say.

845
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:41,960
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna bother, because we... Basically, our friends have not played this game enough, but the show would go, at this point, to anecdotes of the crazy Villa Palettis.

846
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,759
Speaker 1: Like, the time you had one pillar holding the whole thing up.

847
00:49:46,261 --> 00:49:55,080
Speaker 0: Or the time you actually got pieces up on the final plate, the red plate at the top, and you actually had to put pieces on top of pieces.

848
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,862
Speaker 1: That's the cool thing.

849
00:49:55,902 --> 00:49:57,205
Speaker 1: It's like, the rules just keep going.

850
00:49:57,225 --> 00:50:02,560
Speaker 1: If you run out of plates, the only place to go up is to put pillars on top of other pillars directly.

851
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:06,140
Speaker 0: And then you can even put pillars on top of those pillars, if possible.

852
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,667
Speaker 1: This game is just so fun, and so short.

853
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:12,795
Speaker 1: No one in the world would not enjoy this game.

854
00:50:12,855 --> 00:50:13,276
Speaker 1: Buy it.

855
00:50:13,717 --> 00:50:15,000
Speaker 1: If you don't buy this game, you're dumb.

856
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:17,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also pretty cheap.

857
00:50:17,205 --> 00:50:22,420
Speaker 0: Now, the one problem is, is we have the, I think, University Games edition of the game, right?

858
00:50:22,621 --> 00:50:23,405
Speaker 0: That's the publisher.

859
00:50:23,807 --> 00:50:26,320
Speaker 0: And a lot of people have published this game around the world.

860
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:31,780
Speaker 0: You know, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight different publishers listed on BoardGameGeek, right?

861
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,572
Speaker 0: The version we played at PAX, I think, was the German edition, right?

862
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,560
Speaker 0: I don't know who published it, but it came in a yellow box.

863
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:41,420
Speaker 0: It had much better artwork, much better pieces, much better everything.

864
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:48,000
Speaker 0: And the version, the University Games edition that we got, I bought it at funagain.com, is not as high quality.

865
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,972
Speaker 0: The plates are not as, you know, quality.

866
00:50:51,012 --> 00:50:52,760
Speaker 0: The rods, the rods are actually okay.

867
00:50:53,281 --> 00:51:00,220
Speaker 0: The board that goes under the, you know, the bottom, the thing that goes right on the table, the cardboard disc is a lot worse than the German one.

868
00:51:00,821 --> 00:51:06,700
Speaker 0: And in a game like this, right, the manufacturing quality of the pieces matters so much.

869
00:51:07,242 --> 00:51:11,820
Speaker 0: You know, if you get like, you know, if I'm playing, let's say I buy a game, a settler's box, right?

870
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,491
Speaker 0: And one of the cities is a little deformed.

871
00:51:14,872 --> 00:51:16,620
Speaker 0: Or I buy Carcassone.

872
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,420
Speaker 1: Carcassone, actually, of all the colors, green has the gimp.

873
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,809
Speaker 0: Right, as a gimp, one of the meeples is gimped.

874
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,658
Speaker 0: He's got like a broken head or something, right?

875
00:51:24,678 --> 00:51:25,020
Speaker 0: He's all weird.

876
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,460
Speaker 1: He's just smaller than everyone else.

877
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,160
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, okay, there's a manufacturing error and one of the meeples is broken.

878
00:51:30,481 --> 00:51:31,973
Speaker 0: It doesn't affect the game in any way.

879
00:51:32,013 --> 00:51:32,860
Speaker 0: The game is just fine.

880
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:37,260
Speaker 0: You could have all gimped meeples and it wouldn't make a difference as long as they're all the right color, right?

881
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,000
Speaker 0: In a game like this, the manufacture of the pieces matters more than anything.

882
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:50,500
Speaker 0: If one of your rods, like if a green rod is gimped a little bit, it's a little bit short or a little bit tall or a little bit lopsided, that kind of ruins the whole game.

883
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:57,600
Speaker 1: See, but at the same time, if it's within reasonable tolerances, it kind of adds to the game as long as all the pieces are within the same tolerances.

884
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, as long as they don't have to be ultra precise.

885
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:07,460
Speaker 1: No, because then like everyone has like, yeah, this one's a little shorter, this one's a little long and you start to, if you play with the same set a lot, different colors will have different play personalities.

886
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:17,357
Speaker 0: Actually, if all of the plates were perfectly flat and all of the rods were ultra precise and flat and the same exact height and the same exact weight, it would kind of make the game bleh and kind of not so good.

887
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:26,760
Speaker 1: because then, you know, See, actually, I don't think it would because the, if it was like that, it would be a perfect game and it would be just as fun for different reasons.

888
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,343
Speaker 0: It would be, but it would different reasons.

889
00:52:28,383 --> 00:52:36,700
Speaker 0: And I think that the reasons that the current game is fun would be sort of, you know, like a lot of times you'll go get on your knees and you'll see that like the plate isn't even touching a rod.

890
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,069
Speaker 0: There's a rod is just sitting under a plate completely untouched with no weight on it.

891
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,780
Speaker 0: But if the rods are all flat and the plates are flat, you wouldn't have that going on.

892
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,410
Speaker 0: And there'd be a lot more friction, a lot more instability.

893
00:52:46,651 --> 00:52:48,800
Speaker 0: It'd be a lot harder to get the thing to go up higher.

894
00:52:49,522 --> 00:52:51,820
Speaker 1: Actually, there'd be a lot more stability, not instability.

895
00:52:52,441 --> 00:52:57,160
Speaker 0: Well, there'd be instability, not the, the, the, the building itself would be more stable.

896
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,120
Speaker 1: No, because you're allowed to hold the plate when you remove.

897
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,020
Speaker 0: Yes, but the friction would still, there'd be more friction going on.

898
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,047
Speaker 1: It would be more stable.

899
00:53:04,067 --> 00:53:05,740
Speaker 1: Your argument of it being unstable is BS.

900
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,780
Speaker 0: No, there would be instabilities from other sources as opposed to structural instabilities.

901
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,329
Speaker 1: I think the only source of instability is when you're removing pieces.

902
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:16,080
Speaker 1: But since you can hold the plate, that's really not a concern.

903
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,899
Speaker 0: Well, no, but you can hold the plate, but the still, the friction might cause wobbleage.

904
00:53:20,522 --> 00:53:22,733
Speaker 1: I actually, I think it'd be less likely to cause wobbleage.

905
00:53:22,753 --> 00:53:24,260
Speaker 1: However, I have a better idea.

906
00:53:25,281 --> 00:53:34,900
Speaker 1: I would like to take a set and make an alternate set of pieces where everyone has one slightly longer and one slightly shorter of the little pillars.

907
00:53:35,722 --> 00:53:38,139
Speaker 0: But then the long ones would all get stuck on the bottom.

908
00:53:38,562 --> 00:53:41,099
Speaker 1: No, no, but then the game would get weird because it would get, you'd get tilts.

909
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,739
Speaker 0: And the short ones would move all the way up to the top.

910
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,627
Speaker 1: Not necessarily because you'd get tilts.

911
00:53:44,707 --> 00:53:47,620
Speaker 1: Like if there were a small number left at the bottom, you'd pull one out.

912
00:53:47,981 --> 00:53:50,052
Speaker 1: Now it angles down and is resting on the short one.

913
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:51,760
Speaker 1: And then the whole thing is tilted.

914
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,460
Speaker 1: You could, if you figured out the correct tolerances.

915
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,300
Speaker 0: You couldn't do a tilt because all the rods are flat on the top and bottom.

916
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,912
Speaker 1: It would still tilt because remember, they're kind of warped anyway.

917
00:54:01,032 --> 00:54:02,680
Speaker 1: So I think it would work really well.

918
00:54:03,783 --> 00:54:05,899
Speaker 0: The difference in height would have to be incredibly small.

919
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,920
Speaker 1: I'm talking about no more than three millimeters at most.

920
00:54:09,924 --> 00:54:10,560
Speaker 0: It's a tough call.

921
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:13,100
Speaker 1: I've put a lot of thought into this and I think it would work really well.

922
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:16,800
Speaker 1: Also, considering the other games, you know, we played the German version of PAX.

923
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,779
Speaker 1: And it came with a flyer with all the other similar games like Hamster Rollin'.

924
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:25,180
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, all those, there's apparently a whole bunch of games that are like this.

925
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:29,460
Speaker 0: That are basically wooden blocks balancing kind of games.

926
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:35,380
Speaker 0: And this one Hamster Rollin' was this big hamster wheel that rolls around and has all these little shelves in it.

927
00:54:35,621 --> 00:54:38,900
Speaker 0: And you put blocks on the shelves to get it to roll to the left or to the right.

928
00:54:39,422 --> 00:54:40,613
Speaker 0: That game was looking pretty cool.

929
00:54:40,633 --> 00:54:41,299
Speaker 0: I want that game.

930
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:45,800
Speaker 1: The implication is definitely that Via Paletti is the best of these games.

931
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,628
Speaker 0: Well, it did win a spiel de jard.

932
00:54:47,688 --> 00:54:49,760
Speaker 0: None of the other games did, so.

933
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,120
Speaker 1: But still, I feel like because I saw the way those games were put together.

934
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:58,479
Speaker 1: And I saw how stable this game ends up, even if everyone plays like really stupidly.

935
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:03,960
Speaker 1: You could really mess with the pieces and the game would still work just by the math of it.

936
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:09,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, the fact that our sort of poorly put together set, right, still works really well as a game.

937
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:15,680
Speaker 0: Shows that, you know, the construction doesn't need to be perfect to get it to work.

938
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,548
Speaker 1: But yes, I feel like we're running out of steam here.

939
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:18,694
Speaker 1: Via Paletti is awesome.

940
00:55:19,136 --> 00:55:19,839
Speaker 1: You should play it.

941
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,640
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna go to bed.

942
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,146
Speaker 0: I'm taking a look at Hamster Roll here.

943
00:55:23,327 --> 00:55:24,171
Speaker 0: It's looking pretty cool.

944
00:55:24,392 --> 00:55:24,855
Speaker 0: Oh man.

945
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:25,980
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a lot bigger than I thought.

946
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,969
