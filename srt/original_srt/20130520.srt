1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,537
Speaker 0: It's Monday, May 20th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:11,841
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:12,885
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,410
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights tonight.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,429
Speaker 1: It's a Tech News round of Lazy Boats.

6
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:20,948
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,490
Speaker 0: Actually, it's also because Anime Boston is this weekend.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're not going to hear another Geek Nights until probably next week.

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,549
Speaker 0: Emily and I might do a Geek Nights on Shinsekai Ori because we both watched it and it was good.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,290
Speaker 0: We're done with it and we can do a final thoughts.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,710
Speaker 0: I don't think Scott's going to watch it, at least in the next six months.

12
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:43,010
Speaker 1: No, I mean, you know, we made this deal where I would do the one hard panel and you do all the easy panels.

13
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:46,510
Speaker 1: It turns out all the easy panels combined were easier than the one hard panel.

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,228
Speaker 0: So I point out, I'm just going to point this out because I'm kind of a fucker.

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,170
Speaker 0: But when I brought this up, I was very clear.

16
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,270
Speaker 0: I said, so we got five panels and one of them's way harder than the other four.

17
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,990
Speaker 0: So one of us should do all four of the other ones and then one of us should do the fifth one.

18
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:10,370
Speaker 0: And I didn't lie, but I kind of hinted that maybe I wanted to do the short one, hoping that you would take it.

19
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:13,141
Speaker 0: And then I'd be stuck with the four.

20
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:14,989
Speaker 0: that took me like two days to do.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,273
Speaker 1: You know, the thing is, I had.

22
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:24,190
Speaker 1: the only reason I took the hard one, you know, was because I had a vision and I didn't want you to have your vision.

23
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,413
Speaker 0: Scott, I have the same vision.

24
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:31,650
Speaker 0: I have the vision of a clip of that frog, like seeing him and the sit like in the background, all sinister a couple of times.

25
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:37,410
Speaker 0: And then the parallel clip of that flower from the same angles on the fucking island.

26
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:38,568
Speaker 1: I got those clips.

27
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:39,254
Speaker 0: Yes.

28
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:40,910
Speaker 0: Anime Boston is going to be awesome.

29
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:41,549
Speaker 1: Okay.

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,610
Speaker 1: So I have these great clips where it's like island, island, island.

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,209
Speaker 1: Welcome to me, Bros Island.

32
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:52,849
Speaker 1: What's up with this island?

33
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:55,810
Speaker 0: I am the second strongest man on me, Bros Island.

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,970
Speaker 1: He actually never says you get the third strongest.

35
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,865
Speaker 0: No, you don't get the second.

36
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:00,150
Speaker 0: I remember.

37
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,169
Speaker 1: You don't get the second or the first.

38
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,631
Speaker 0: Yeah.

39
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,590
Speaker 0: Well, you know who the second and first are.

40
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:03,943
Speaker 1: Yeah.

41
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:05,369
Speaker 0: It's Joy Rock.

42
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,154
Speaker 1: Right.

43
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:06,664
Speaker 1: But who's the...

44
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:09,469
Speaker 0: You know what, where Joy Rock's name came from?

45
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:10,529
Speaker 1: No.

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,775
Speaker 0: That's some anime trivia.

47
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,770
Speaker 0: I'll bring up at the panel that I, I'm scared.

48
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,669
Speaker 1: You're proud that you know?

49
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,510
Speaker 0: I am proud that I know this because I learned it from Luke in an era when you couldn't look this up.

50
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,117
Speaker 0: How do you know that?

51
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:22,330
Speaker 1: that's true if you learned it from Luke?

52
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:28,350
Speaker 0: Because in, recently as in like yesterday, I looked it up to make sure it wasn't just bullshit.

53
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,801
Speaker 1: Okay.

54
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:32,090
Speaker 0: While I was finishing the four other panels.

55
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,610
Speaker 1: Also, by the way, that movie is still pretty funny.

56
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,300
Speaker 0: You know what, Slayers?

57
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:36,149
Speaker 0: Still pretty good.

58
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:41,730
Speaker 1: I'm telling you, there's some good, it was not, it was not unpleasant to watch that shit.

59
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,617
Speaker 0: So how about that strip search?

60
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,230
Speaker 0: before we get into the main bit of this tech news round.

61
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,450
Speaker 1: Shouldn't we talk about that on Wednesday?

62
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,110
Speaker 0: I guess it's interesting that, you know, Emily and I, a while ago, we were talking.

63
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,810
Speaker 0: We were talking about how, wow, Scott's really into strip search.

64
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,735
Speaker 0: Like, I like it okay.

65
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,150
Speaker 0: And it's a good show and everyone's, we're all kind of into it.

66
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:01,890
Speaker 1: I like it because it's honest, right?

67
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,290
Speaker 1: It shows you like, you know, these people that are people just like us, our kind of people, right?

68
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,610
Speaker 1: It's a show made with our kind of people, for our kind of people, by our kind of people.

69
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,010
Speaker 0: So Scott, by that logic, the kind of person who's on the Jersey Shore is the kind of person who would enjoy the Jersey Shore.

70
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:21,950
Speaker 0: It's made for that person by a richer version of that person.

71
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,769
Speaker 1: But that is a horrible person.

72
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:26,829
Speaker 1: We are good people.

73
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,310
Speaker 0: I make no value judgements.

74
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,908
Speaker 1: I make those judgements.

75
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,570
Speaker 1: But judge Scott, the discussion.

76
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,027
Speaker 1: Gavel.

77
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,050
Speaker 0: I feel like if we need a super crab people on a Thursday, we could do Judge Grim and Scott.

78
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:39,228
Speaker 0: It'd be a pale simulacrum.

79
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,709
Speaker 1: Judge John Hodgman is far superior.

80
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,828
Speaker 1: Just listen to him.

81
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,010
Speaker 0: We would be but a pale simulacrum, a poor homunculus.

82
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,650
Speaker 1: What I really want is Judge John Hodgman to find some, you know, dispute between me and rim and then rule in my favor because I'm right.

83
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,550
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure he'd rule in my favor regardless of what the dispute was.

84
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,910
Speaker 1: I think his gavel of justice would cut through your bullshit.

85
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,870
Speaker 0: I think the dispute we would have him go over is which one of us is right about his ruling.

86
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:02,890
Speaker 1: Anyway.

87
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:15,430
Speaker 0: But what Emily and I were discussing, and a few I've discussed this with a few other people too, was that it appeared because you always expressed a particular disdain for reality shows of any sort.

88
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:22,450
Speaker 0: And when you got into strip search and got way into it, it had a momentum similar to your entrance to My Little Pony.

89
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:30,830
Speaker 0: So we posited merely that this was going to serve as a gateway drug, a marijuana that would then lead you into the harder stuff.

90
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:32,670
Speaker 0: And what are you watching currently?

91
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,147
Speaker 1: I'm only watching.

92
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,650
Speaker 1: Okay, so I can explain this as well.

93
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:41,609
Speaker 0: So I know you found me on top of a pile of cocaine, but just hear me out.

94
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,401
Speaker 1: Hear me out.

95
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:44,188
Speaker 1: It's not a bug.

96
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,290
Speaker 1: So I'm not watching anything else stupid.

97
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,130
Speaker 0: Before you know it, it's going to be Honey Boo Boo.

98
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,203
Speaker 1: I don't even know what that is.

99
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,225
Speaker 0: Yes, you do.

100
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,013
Speaker 1: Barely.

101
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,183
Speaker 1: I saw it on South Park.

102
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:53,769
Speaker 1: That's about it.

103
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:56,470
Speaker 1: That's all I know is what I saw in South Park.

104
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,630
Speaker 1: All right, so Kitchen Nightmares is not stupid, as stupid as the right.

105
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,348
Speaker 1: So here's the thing.

106
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,401
Speaker 1: There was that clip that went around Reddit.

107
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:05,830
Speaker 1: I didn't even know the show existed, right?

108
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:11,290
Speaker 1: And all I knew about Gordon Ramsay was that he was the angry chef guy.

109
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:14,190
Speaker 1: And I saw him make scrambled eggs once on YouTube, right?

110
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,608
Speaker 0: Those are really good scrambled eggs.

111
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:23,010
Speaker 1: Right, so I made those scrambled eggs, and the taste of those scrambled eggs made me think, huh, maybe that angry guy is not so bad with his angriness.

112
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:30,090
Speaker 1: Because goddamn, if his one YouTube video can make me cook fancy restaurant quality eggs, he fucking knows something.

113
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,086
Speaker 1: That guy, right?

114
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:44,490
Speaker 1: So then I saw him, you know, in this video from a show I didn't know existed where he went to some restaurant, and he was supposed to help the people running the restaurant, but they were the shittiest people on Earth.

115
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,470
Speaker 0: Perhaps they watched Jersey Shore.

116
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:55,730
Speaker 0: You know, it's interesting that the internet fallout of that was even, I only knew about this because Darryl Surratt retweeted a picture of the comments related to this.

117
00:05:57,432 --> 00:06:01,429
Speaker 1: So then I was like, all right, what the fuck is this show normally like?

118
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:05,670
Speaker 1: Right, so I went and I saw it was on Netflix randomly.

119
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:14,830
Speaker 1: I wasn't even like going out of my way to find it, but I just, I happened to, I turned on Netflix and I was looking for something to watch, and I saw his face there, and he had a knife, and it was like kitchen nightmares.

120
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,889
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, let me see what this show is actually normally like.

121
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,410
Speaker 0: And I wasn't really looking for porn, I just turned on the computer.

122
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,550
Speaker 0: And there was porn there, right.

123
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:27,690
Speaker 1: So I gotta tell you, the US version of the show is actually not that great.

124
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:30,658
Speaker 1: It's sort of like half good and half bad, right?

125
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:48,250
Speaker 1: Half the episode, you're learning about how to run restaurants, you know, you're learning about like, you know, what makes food good or bad, how to buy, you know, how to save money, and you know, the amount you spent, the restaurant costs to like build a dish on the menu versus how much they sell it for.

126
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:52,350
Speaker 1: And it's actually pretty interesting running a restaurant shit, right?

127
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,130
Speaker 0: You know, it's interesting, how many episodes did you watch?

128
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:00,610
Speaker 0: Because the fact that you said build as opposed to make is telling as to how much of the lexicon is seeping into your pores.

129
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,290
Speaker 1: My dad works in food service.

130
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,529
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I always forget that.

131
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,128
Speaker 1: Anyway.

132
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,170
Speaker 0: Can you get us tickets to a game of something?

133
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,369
Speaker 1: What game do you want to go to?

134
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,054
Speaker 0: No.

135
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:08,686
Speaker 1: I know.

136
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,370
Speaker 1: You think if we had hockey tickets, we wouldn't already be?

137
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:19,310
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, but the US one is full of contrived reality show nonsense.

138
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:24,930
Speaker 1: Like each episode, he'll do like some promotional gimmick to like get people to come to the restaurant.

139
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,130
Speaker 1: And like once he had like, it was in Miami and he did like a fashion show outside the restaurant.

140
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,943
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, please.

141
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:30,330
Speaker 1: Right.

142
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,490
Speaker 1: Or like he always, he'll always arrive at the restaurant in some ridiculous vehicle, you know, of some kind.

143
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:45,410
Speaker 1: And he's always, you know, he's yells at people a lot more and they portray it as him being like way angrier and shit and the people being way dumber and complete fuck ups.

144
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,192
Speaker 1: What might?

145
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:52,050
Speaker 1: the worst offender of the whole thing was one time they were trying to show how dirty and nasty this kitchen was.

146
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:52,388
Speaker 1: Yeah.

147
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,148
Speaker 1: And while they were like during a meal service, a bowl of rice got knocked over.

148
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:56,570
Speaker 1: Right.

149
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:02,242
Speaker 1: But if you look at that, why was that camera aiming at that bowl of rice on top of that counter?

150
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,950
Speaker 1: that was just sitting there and it zoomed way in on that bowl of rice.

151
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:08,709
Speaker 1: And you see like a hand come in and knock it over onto the floor.

152
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:10,428
Speaker 1: But you don't see whose hand that was.

153
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:12,590
Speaker 1: And it doesn't look like anyone who works there was.

154
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,270
Speaker 1: So clearly the staff of the show knocked over a rice and filmed it.

155
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:17,480
Speaker 1: And it's like, really?

156
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:18,569
Speaker 1: Really, guys?

157
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,009
Speaker 0: Well, maybe it's like Unsolved Mysteries where that was a reenactment of the thing that happened.

158
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:33,190
Speaker 1: You know, also at the end of every episode, it says, you know, things may have been filmed out of order, you know, so clearly they changed the order of the event.

159
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,230
Speaker 0: See, what I don't understand is why do they even need that disclaimer?

160
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,206
Speaker 1: I agree.

161
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,347
Speaker 0: Who thinks that a reality show is real?

162
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,150
Speaker 1: There's another.

163
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:49,603
Speaker 1: there's another disclaimer that says how all the people who are eating in the restaurant during that time are basically getting free food paid for by the TV show, which is what.

164
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:53,510
Speaker 1: which is why, like, you know, when you're in a restaurant, people send food back occasionally.

165
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:56,307
Speaker 1: But even in a bad restaurant doesn't happen that often.

166
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:56,710
Speaker 1: Right.

167
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:59,910
Speaker 0: I've sent maybe two things back in my entire life.

168
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,290
Speaker 1: When you watch this show, it's like everything is coming back constantly.

169
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,842
Speaker 1: And I think it's clearly because they tell the people in the restaurant, we're buying you food.

170
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:09,150
Speaker 1: if it's no good, send it back, please.

171
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,204
Speaker 1: It's for the drama.

172
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:10,549
Speaker 1: Right.

173
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:17,310
Speaker 1: But I went and I found the UK version, the original because I didn't even realize it was UK version because I didn't even Wikipedia.

174
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:20,290
Speaker 0: So that locally grown stuff really wasn't doing it for us.

175
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,749
Speaker 0: You started importing direct.

176
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:25,850
Speaker 1: OK, so the what was I saying?

177
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,152
Speaker 1: Right.

178
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,309
Speaker 1: The UK version.

179
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:28,892
Speaker 1: Right.

180
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:31,850
Speaker 1: During one of the US episodes, he's like, this is my hundredth whatever.

181
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,179
Speaker 1: And I'm like, it's only season two.

182
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,165
Speaker 1: How was this your hundredth?

183
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:34,870
Speaker 1: Right.

184
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,277
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, there were like five seasons in the UK.

185
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:41,950
Speaker 1: So I went and that happened to actually be on Netflix as well.

186
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,430
Speaker 1: Even after I tormented it, I found that it was on Netflix.

187
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,750
Speaker 0: I love how even when we pay for Netflix, the instinct is to go straight to the pirate.

188
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,293
Speaker 1: Exactly.

189
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,139
Speaker 1: That won't be on Netflix.

190
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,509
Speaker 1: Oh, the UK one actually is there.

191
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,890
Speaker 1: The UK one is actually like a quiet documentary kind of thing where it's like he quietly goes into the restaurant.

192
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:03,870
Speaker 1: He's still like you pieces, you know, but it's more like it comes off as a totally different.

193
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,099
Speaker 1: He's not like a mean, angry, crazy person.

194
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,430
Speaker 1: He's just sort of like, oh, fuck off you pieces.

195
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:09,813
Speaker 1: Right.

196
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:14,570
Speaker 1: It's sort of like even though he's saying sort of the same things, like he's a British person with British people.

197
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:15,393
Speaker 1: Right.

198
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:17,629
Speaker 1: You know, sort of like really come on.

199
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:18,392
Speaker 1: Right.

200
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:22,130
Speaker 1: And it's sort of I don't think it's filmed out of order, at least it doesn't.

201
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,770
Speaker 1: It seems to be in his nose sensationalist nonsense.

202
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,610
Speaker 1: He just literally and he narrates it himself sort of quietly.

203
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,890
Speaker 1: It's almost like a nature program, only the nature is people fucking up a restaurant.

204
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:32,553
Speaker 0: Not bad.

205
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,150
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, here, watch as the cheetah doesn't know how to cook for shit.

206
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:40,110
Speaker 1: Watch as this waiter can't even remember what is on the menu.

207
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:47,790
Speaker 0: It's funny, not that you would have watched it, but there's actually an episode of Archer where they have a mission where they have to infiltrate a kitchen to protect some diplomat from being poisoned.

208
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,301
Speaker 1: Watch as Archer can't aim that gun for shit.

209
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:52,050
Speaker 0: And it's basically himself in the foot.

210
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:55,530
Speaker 0: It's basically Gordon Ramsay, Kitchen Nightmares reality show.

211
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,170
Speaker 0: But it's just because none of them know how to cook and they're all pretending to be the chefs at this fancy restaurant.

212
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,817
Speaker 0: It's actually a pretty good episode.

213
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,010
Speaker 0: You might enjoy it if you don't like Archer in general.

214
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,715
Speaker 1: The other thing is in the U.S.

215
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,830
Speaker 1: one, it seems clearly there's some sort of thing going on where.

216
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:16,444
Speaker 1: You know, he basically, what was I saying?

217
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:18,550
Speaker 1: I got a beep on my phone, so I got distracted.

218
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:19,390
Speaker 0: I wonder what that was.

219
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:20,693
Speaker 1: Yeah, the U.S.

220
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:20,994
Speaker 1: one.

221
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:27,570
Speaker 1: It seems like they have a deal with the restaurants, like they basically save the restaurants by infusing a ton of money into them.

222
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:27,791
Speaker 1: Right.

223
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:30,442
Speaker 1: They everyone gets a renovation of their front of the house.

224
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,210
Speaker 1: Everyone gets like new stoves.

225
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,370
Speaker 0: So they basically pay you like, all right, here's the money to cover the fact that you're going to get the worst possible publicity.

226
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,690
Speaker 1: Instead of paying them to be on the show, they basically invest money in the restaurant as payment for being on the show.

227
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:50,810
Speaker 1: And right in the UK one, literally, it's just like him and a few cameras go to the restaurant and he works with them all week helping them.

228
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:51,513
Speaker 1: Right.

229
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:53,949
Speaker 1: You know, and that's what you get is you get help.

230
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,421
Speaker 0: So the moral is when Running Man comes to the U.S.

231
00:11:57,763 --> 00:11:59,229
Speaker 0: bastardized, we shouldn't watch it.

232
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,720
Speaker 1: Running Man is not a reality show.

233
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,724
Speaker 1: It's a variety show.

234
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:03,930
Speaker 1: It's different.

235
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,476
Speaker 1: It's not the same.

236
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:06,142
Speaker 1: It is.

237
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:06,970
Speaker 1: It's not even close.

238
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,412
Speaker 0: I'm not.

239
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:08,820
Speaker 0: I'm not saying you're wrong.

240
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,569
Speaker 0: I'm laughing for other reasons.

241
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:15,383
Speaker 0: This was all foretold in the book of strip search.

242
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,070
Speaker 1: I'm not smoking cocaine.

243
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,793
Speaker 1: It's just.

244
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,680
Speaker 1: it's still still just weed.

245
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,350
Speaker 1: There's more weed, different kinds of weed.

246
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:23,750
Speaker 1: So

247
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:39,550
Speaker 0: since we're doing a tech news roundup and there's no real news, I do want to talk about something because I realized that most of you out there who want to be Linux administrators or IT guys or developers, a lot of Geek Night's people, you guys who listen, have aspirations.

248
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,562
Speaker 0: A lot of you are in high school of going to college or you're in college.

249
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:44,530
Speaker 0: You have aspirations of having the kind of job I have.

250
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:53,610
Speaker 0: I'm going to give you all some homework right now because I realize that nobody coming out of college fucking knows even the most basic network system administration stuff.

251
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,301
Speaker 0: This is the kind of thing that should be second nature.

252
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,370
Speaker 0: And also, it's a really useful tool.

253
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,334
Speaker 0: My homework for you is very simple.

254
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:07,810
Speaker 0: You are not a system administrator of any stripe unless you can get MRTG, which is a really simple little thing.

255
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,430
Speaker 0: You know, those graphs, like you look at a college, you're like, I wonder how fast their Internet is.

256
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:17,810
Speaker 0: And there's always this like green and blue graph that's like hidden somewhere on the website, like the computer science department links to it.

257
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,910
Speaker 1: Or like you log into your line node and it's all these graphs of like CPU usage and it goes like this green blob, you know, this wiggling up and down.

258
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,649
Speaker 1: It shows you how much your CPU has been used.

259
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,111
Speaker 0: Yep.

260
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:41,930
Speaker 0: Now, MRTG is one of the primus tools in this essay or a network administrator's handbook, because it basically lets you track arbitrary amounts of data without increasing amounts of storage necessary to keep that data.

261
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:47,070
Speaker 0: Because as data gets old, it aggregates into into basically sparser data points.

262
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:47,552
Speaker 1: Right.

263
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:48,295
Speaker 1: So think about it.

264
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:51,990
Speaker 1: If you were going to, say, track your CPU usage for the year, right?

265
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:58,790
Speaker 1: Well, you're going to have three hundred and sixty five times as much data as you do on the last day of the year as you did on the first day.

266
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,210
Speaker 0: So say you take your system load, you know, per core, every second you take an average of that second.

267
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,835
Speaker 0: So you have a data point every second.

268
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:10,330
Speaker 0: And maybe for the entire current day, you keep all those seconds because it's not just like 80 something.

269
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,933
Speaker 0: That's not that many data points.

270
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:20,630
Speaker 0: But then you take the average of, say, the hours or 20 minute intervals and use that to populate a week long graph.

271
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,390
Speaker 0: Take the averages of entire days to make year long graphs.

272
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:30,910
Speaker 0: And you can see that it's really easy to visualize trends in data usage over time.

273
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:33,237
Speaker 0: And there are many other tools that do this.

274
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:37,350
Speaker 0: And the reason I bring up MRTG is that it's so commonly used.

275
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,511
Speaker 0: It's the simplest one.

276
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:54,210
Speaker 0: And if you want to prove that you know how to administer systems, all you need to do to prove that to me is take MRTG and get it to monitor any Linux server's CPU and memory usage and have that graph appear.

277
00:14:54,591 --> 00:15:07,670
Speaker 0: So if you will learn more about IT and system administration by making MRTG monitor your Linux servers CPU and memory than you will by just about any other thing you could do in any class you could go to in college.

278
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:14,109
Speaker 1: And if you happen to be interviewed by Rym for a job and you have MRTG on your resume and he asks you, "Oh, you wrote this on your resume.

279
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:14,430
Speaker 1: What is

280
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:14,490
Speaker 1: it?".

281
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:19,609
Speaker 1: And you actually know what the fuck it is and can actually, you know, convince him that you know what the hell it is.

282
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,781
Speaker 1: Probably not going to need to ask you any more questions.

283
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,310
Speaker 1: He'll believe that you just know everything else.

284
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:25,055
Speaker 0: I will ask you one other question.

285
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:29,590
Speaker 0: If you think you're an administrator, I would ask you what a quadruple A record is in DNS.

286
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:31,998
Speaker 1: I don't even know that.

287
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:33,950
Speaker 1: I know what a 1A record is.

288
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,810
Speaker 0: What's a 1A record?

289
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,210
Speaker 1: It's just you map up a name to an IP address.

290
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:41,230
Speaker 0: So a quadruple A record is just four A's.

291
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,949
Speaker 1: I know that, but what is the difference between a 4A's and a 1A?

292
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:44,813
Speaker 0: IPv6.

293
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,719
Speaker 0: That's all.

294
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:46,183
Speaker 1: That's all.

295
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,612
Speaker 1: There you go.

296
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:50,058
Speaker 1: Now I know.

297
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:52,728
Speaker 1: How do you format the IPv6 address?

298
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:53,310
Speaker 1: Just the same way?

299
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:53,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, same way.

300
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,461
Speaker 1: And you just have normal DNS.

301
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:56,270
Speaker 1: It's not like...

302
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,105
Speaker 0: Yeah, DNS maps...

303
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,132
Speaker 1: It'd be like IPv6.

304
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:00,116
Speaker 1: It'd be like frontrowcrew.com.

305
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:06,310
Speaker 1: It'd be like .ipv6 and then it would be, you know, A and then an IPv6 address.

306
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the same format as a regular A record.

307
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,376
Speaker 1: Now, what if I use like, you know, IPv6?

308
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:14,490
Speaker 1: Do I have to put the full fucking address or can I use like colon, colon, colon, colon, colon, colon?

309
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:22,770
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you can do colon, colon, but don't quote me on that because I'm not 100% sure how Vine would handle it because I've never actually bothered to set up.

310
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,169
Speaker 1: Actually, a set of addresses, not one, right?

311
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,910
Speaker 0: Well, it depends on what kind of... We're already getting deeper than I would ask on a resume.

312
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:33,008
Speaker 1: So you'd hire me?

313
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:43,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, you are a more competent server administrator than most people I've ever met with whom I was asking questions in the hopes of hiring to be a system administrator.

314
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,389
Speaker 1: I'll work for you for half a million dollars a year.

315
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.

316
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:47,798
Speaker 1: No?

317
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,068
Speaker 1: Okay.

318
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,307
Speaker 0: I'd forgive you a quarter of that.

319
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:52,325
Speaker 0: Half?

320
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:52,750
Speaker 0: Anyway.

321
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,630
Speaker 1: Forty vacation days?

322
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:00,950
Speaker 0: Thought you had a thing.

323
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:01,692
Speaker 1: A thing?

324
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:02,883
Speaker 1: Oh, a thing of the day.

325
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:03,590
Speaker 1: I actually forgot it.

326
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,630
Speaker 1: No, I didn't say things of the day.

327
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:04,854
Speaker 1: Oh.

328
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:11,709
Speaker 0: Alright, I guess now we can do things of the day.

329
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:16,329
Speaker 1: I completely forgot it about things of the day, but I actually have one prepared in my delicious.

330
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,249
Speaker 0: I don't, so I'm going to find one while you pull it up.

331
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:25,790
Speaker 1: So what this is, is a Flickr gallery, which I remembered that I had delicioused because we were talking about Flickr.

332
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,347
Speaker 0: Wow, Flickr gallery, that you delicioused.

333
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:28,945
Speaker 1: Yep.

334
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,009
Speaker 0: Don't you mean a Yahoo gallery that you Yahooed?

335
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,990
Speaker 1: Well, delicious isn't owned by Yahoo anymore.

336
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:36,157
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, right.

337
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:38,150
Speaker 0: It's basically... Well, let's see what happens with delicious.

338
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:38,550
Speaker 1: Yeah.

339
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:47,110
Speaker 1: But anyway, what this is, is somebody found a set of old Japanese manco cards from the 50s, and they're totally amazing.

340
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:51,649
Speaker 1: It's like looking at old baseball cards of Japan with crazy, awesome characters on them.

341
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,745
Speaker 1: It's totally fucking sweet, this robot.

342
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:54,230
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

343
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,770
Speaker 1: It's like if I could get these cards, like maybe like a big version of some of these to put on the wall.

344
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,860
Speaker 1: Oh, man, that'd be so awesome.

345
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:02,290
Speaker 1: But I guess not.

346
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:06,047
Speaker 1: But in the meantime, you can look at them in this high-res Flickr photo.

347
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:06,610
Speaker 1: Oh, sweet.

348
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:11,130
Speaker 0: So I got two really short, dumb things of the day.

349
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:11,570
Speaker 1: Okay.

350
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:17,910
Speaker 0: One is a mash-up of that Titan anime that you guys don't need to know anything about.

351
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,810
Speaker 1: That I haven't watched yet.

352
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:19,470
Speaker 0: I haven't either.

353
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,610
Speaker 1: Titan Attack on Titan?

354
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:20,866
Speaker 1: Yeah.

355
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,509
Speaker 1: It's the popular anime right now.

356
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:24,430
Speaker 0: Ew, Tana.

357
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,151
Speaker 0: Forget all.

358
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:31,149
Speaker 0: Anyway, so someone mashed it up effectively with initial D.

359
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:31,853
Speaker 1: Oh.

360
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:33,109
Speaker 1: And this is horrifying.

361
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,428
Speaker 1: Maybe I should watch it now.

362
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,790
Speaker 0: Horrifyingly, deliciously hilarious.

363
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:38,348
Speaker 0: Okay.

364
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:47,450
Speaker 0: So I made this a thing of the day, specifically on a non-Wednesday, because I want normal people to watch this video and just wonder why, wonder how, what this is.

365
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,690
Speaker 1: You said you had two things of the day.

366
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,588
Speaker 0: It's my real thing of the day.

367
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,490
Speaker 0: Tobias Fueke, you may know from Arrested Development, which is a pretty funny show.

368
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,470
Speaker 1: I hear he's making a comeback.

369
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,870
Speaker 0: So in the lead-up to the new season of Arrested Development, he has his sizzle reel.

370
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:06,530
Speaker 0: And what I have here is him auditioning to be on Bravest Warriors.

371
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,104
Speaker 0: What?

372
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:12,510
Speaker 1: That is the craziest combination that I would never have predicted in a million years.

373
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:13,268
Speaker 1: Wait, wait.

374
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,730
Speaker 1: So is this something made by some fan?

375
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,070
Speaker 1: You need more details.

376
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,150
Speaker 0: So this is on Cartoon Hangover.

377
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:20,606
Speaker 1: Okay.

378
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:22,850
Speaker 1: So it's something the Bravest Warriors people got him.

379
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:30,429
Speaker 0: But the manner in which it is done is great because he is- What character is he trying to be?

380
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:31,110
Speaker 0: Okay.

381
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:32,969
Speaker 0: So I'm going to spoil the joke for you.

382
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:36,605
Speaker 0: He presents like, "I'm going to audition to be on Bravest

383
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:37,067
Speaker 0: Warriors."

384
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,930
Speaker 0: And then his reel is him superimposed into the show, not talking.

385
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,890
Speaker 0: So it's like him in the background playing catch.

386
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:50,050
Speaker 1: Is there actually an episode of Bravest Warriors that's going on while this happens?

387
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:51,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's all episodes we've seen.

388
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,529
Speaker 0: He basically inserts himself into- About cabbage?

389
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:55,430
Speaker 0: Old episodes.

390
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, butter lettuce makes an appearance.

391
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:58,649
Speaker 0: Butter lettuce!

392
00:19:58,972 --> 00:19:59,889
Speaker 0: Butter lettuce party!

393
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,590
Speaker 1: So apparently it's a Bravest Warriors comic.

394
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,469
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for trades.

395
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:02,573
Speaker 1: Ooh.

396
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,550
Speaker 1: Yep.

397
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,290
Speaker 0: I'm kind of excited about that.

398
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:07,310
Speaker 1: I got Adventure Time trade number one.

399
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:07,801
Speaker 1: Yeah?

400
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,589
Speaker 1: It's Adventure Time.

401
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:10,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got a bunch of the Adventure Time comics.

402
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,330
Speaker 0: They're great.

403
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:11,787
Speaker 1: Yeah.

404
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:13,110
Speaker 1: Okay.

405
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,049
Speaker 1: It's a lot like Simpsons comics.

406
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:15,726
Speaker 0: Yeah.

407
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:22,790
Speaker 0: It's got that nice blend of low key humor and sort of the background jokes and all those things that I like about that kind of comic.

408
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,710
Speaker 0: So it's the Tech News Roundup, but first, in that moment- Anime Boston.

409
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,450
Speaker 1: We're not going to talk about that in the show again until next year maybe.

410
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,449
Speaker 1: This weekend.

411
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:45,310
Speaker 0: The only thing I have to say about it is if you weren't paying attention to non-anime normal news, but somehow you listen to Geek Nights, one, there's a huge train collision that has basically fucked Amtrak.

412
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,190
Speaker 1: As of Dateline now- Hasn't it also sort of fucked Metro North New Haven line?

413
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:51,750
Speaker 0: As of now, Amtrak is not unfucked.

414
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,969
Speaker 0: So if you're taking Amtrak to- As of when I checked a little while ago- Okay.

415
00:20:57,151 --> 00:21:02,909
Speaker 0: All I'm saying is double check that Amtrak will get you there if you planned to take Amtrak.

416
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,849
Speaker 1: We're using Bolt Bus, right?

417
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:04,770
Speaker 0: We're using Bolt Bus.

418
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,310
Speaker 1: You got my ticket?

419
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:05,968
Speaker 0: I got your ticket.

420
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:16,770
Speaker 0: Two, they've instituted the MCCA against Anime Boston's wishes a mandatory sort of city run bag inspection at all entrances.

421
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,188
Speaker 1: This might be the end.

422
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,930
Speaker 0: All I'm saying is- I foresee doom.

423
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:36,849
Speaker 0: I got a pretty awful response from them from my press inquiry that we're not going to really cover this unless it's disaster, but I'm just warning you, be ready for possible lines getting into the con.

424
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,265
Speaker 1: Yup.

425
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:45,708
Speaker 1: And plan, at least on the Friday while you see how it is, to go into the con and not come out until the end.

426
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,330
Speaker 0: Problem is you can't even get into the mall to eat.

427
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:48,927
Speaker 1: I know.

428
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:49,590
Speaker 1: Anyway.

429
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,230
Speaker 0: Anyway.

430
00:21:50,631 --> 00:22:01,390
Speaker 0: But if it does prove a problem, rest assured, I will make sure that those who are responsible for the problem are held fully accountable in the eyes of the internet, unforgetting and unfeeling.

431
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,050
Speaker 1: Other meta moments.

432
00:22:04,471 --> 00:22:07,030
Speaker 1: The book is still the player of games.

433
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,790
Speaker 1: I've actually fucking finished it like weeks ago.

434
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:10,590
Speaker 0: I'm going to start reading it on the bus to Anime Boston.

435
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,269
Speaker 1: I'm reading the book that came before it.

436
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,029
Speaker 1: Don't worry.

437
00:22:15,391 --> 00:22:21,930
Speaker 1: Even though the player of games is the second book in a series, it is not like Prince of Nothing, where it is a serial series.

438
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,610
Speaker 1: I guess any right.

439
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,890
Speaker 1: It is simply books that take place in the same universe.

440
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:28,470
Speaker 0: Well, you know, you could argue.

441
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,429
Speaker 1: And I had a full on.

442
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:29,949
Speaker 1: I did not.

443
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,483
Speaker 1: You know, there is nothing in that first book that gave.

444
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,930
Speaker 1: that would have, you know, really was necessary at all to understand that second book.

445
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:39,750
Speaker 1: So something you can read player of games without reading.

446
00:22:40,112 --> 00:22:41,568
Speaker 1: Consider Phlebas and you will be OK.

447
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,890
Speaker 0: Would you still consider a series serial if the episodes were aired out of order on purpose?

448
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:47,869
Speaker 1: Like Haruhi?

449
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,588
Speaker 0: Like Haruhi.

450
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:49,267
Speaker 1: I don't know.

451
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,088
Speaker 1: What order should you watch Haruhi in?

452
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,330
Speaker 0: Watch it in the broadcast order, I guess.

453
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,930
Speaker 0: Doesn't matter.

454
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:54,670
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter.

455
00:22:55,452 --> 00:23:02,950
Speaker 0: I think the broadcast order is better than the chronological order just because it gives you that kind of baccano feeling and it kind of it has a better pacing.

456
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,362
Speaker 1: OK.

457
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,190
Speaker 0: But it doesn't really matter.

458
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:09,269
Speaker 0: It's interesting that you still don't know the primary conceit of that show.

459
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:10,670
Speaker 1: I thought I did.

460
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,450
Speaker 1: It was the girls looking for aliens, which is the crazy one.

461
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,349
Speaker 1: But everyone else is the alien, but not her.

462
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:15,842
Speaker 0: Yeah.

463
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,830
Speaker 0: That's that's not really what the show is about.

464
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,245
Speaker 1: OK.

465
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,009
Speaker 1: And it's time travel of some kind.

466
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,829
Speaker 0: I mean, you think initialties about the cars.

467
00:23:22,092 --> 00:23:22,670
Speaker 0: It's about haws.

468
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,830
Speaker 0: You think antennas about people.

469
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,705
Speaker 0: It's about cars.

470
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:26,910
Speaker 1: Did you see that?

471
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:28,170
Speaker 1: Did you see that picture?

472
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:28,897
Speaker 1: Yeah.

473
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,609
Speaker 1: Some Sailor Moon S or whatever it is.

474
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,207
Speaker 0: So, the tech news round up.

475
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,488
Speaker 1: Round up.

476
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,246
Speaker 1: Round up.

477
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:38,947
Speaker 0: Weeds killed it.

478
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,050
Speaker 0: I want to start with some.

479
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:41,530
Speaker 0: It is science and technology.

480
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,830
Speaker 0: We don't talk enough about science.

481
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:47,790
Speaker 0: The FDA is actually looking into, for real, regulating triclosan.

482
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:50,468
Speaker 0: And I don't think any of you know or care what that is.

483
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:57,390
Speaker 0: But basically, all that antibacterial soap that everyone uses that's so ineffective and doesn't do anything is a waste of money.

484
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:01,950
Speaker 0: Well, the FDA is starting to say that, hey, maybe this is ineffective and doesn't actually do anything.

485
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,728
Speaker 0: It's a waste of money.

486
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:06,450
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, you know, we're talking about the soaps you wash your hands with, right?

487
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:11,870
Speaker 1: Those Purells, I think some of them might have triclosan, but they also just have fucking rubbing alcohol in them.

488
00:24:12,496 --> 00:24:13,790
Speaker 1: Nothing wrong with rubbing alcohol.

489
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:22,130
Speaker 0: I've read so many studies saying that using consumer grade hand sanitizers has basically zero effect on disease transmission.

490
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,189
Speaker 1: I'm not saying they have an effect.

491
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,870
Speaker 0: There are hand sanitizers that are effective.

492
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,508
Speaker 0: I used to use them.

493
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,950
Speaker 0: You know what happens when you use them?

494
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,589
Speaker 1: Your hands burn.

495
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,450
Speaker 0: You don't have fingerprints anymore.

496
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:37,690
Speaker 0: My fingerprint reader on my laptop stopped working when I worked at the hospital because I no longer had a fingerprint.

497
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:41,730
Speaker 1: But yeah, I don't ever use the Purell shit, right?

498
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:48,310
Speaker 1: But I don't specifically seek out antibacterial soap, but triclosan, I just wash my hands with whatever soap is there.

499
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:55,610
Speaker 0: But the FDA is investigating a lot of data saying that not only is triclosan encouraging bacteria to be resistant to it.

500
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,889
Speaker 1: Even I've known that for years.

501
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:01,910
Speaker 0: But it also might have hormonal effects on humans and may be considered toxic.

502
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:03,289
Speaker 1: I did not know that until today.

503
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:04,869
Speaker 0: So there's an article on it.

504
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,050
Speaker 0: The FDA is going to release some rulings on it in the near future.

505
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,470
Speaker 1: Can we short sell on some soap companies or has that basically already had an effect?

506
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,655
Speaker 0: I don't know.

507
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:15,629
Speaker 0: I didn't look into that.

508
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:21,370
Speaker 0: I don't invest in those kinds of sectors because I'm not up enough on the inside baseball.

509
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:22,230
Speaker 1: You don't know about soap?

510
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:23,549
Speaker 0: I don't know about soap.

511
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,230
Speaker 1: I guess Procter & Gamble makes a fuck ton of soap, right?

512
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,950
Speaker 0: I know that soap is a really slow way to send messages to a system.

513
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:29,950
Speaker 1: You know what I learned?

514
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,149
Speaker 1: Here's a related thing that I know.

515
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:36,330
Speaker 1: Alright, so I was taking CPR training and one of the questions we had.

516
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,908
Speaker 0: I was wondering if you're going to be like XMLRPC.

517
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:46,190
Speaker 1: And one of the questions we had to answer is that when you're washing your hands, what is the most important thing in determining how clean your hands are actually going to get?

518
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,270
Speaker 1: A. The temperature of the water.

519
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,483
Speaker 1: Nope.

520
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,349
Speaker 1: B. The soap.

521
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:50,946
Speaker 0: Nope.

522
00:25:51,935 --> 00:25:53,130
Speaker 1: C. The friction.

523
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,170
Speaker 0: Well, it depends.

524
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:57,270
Speaker 0: Is D. The amount of time spent?

525
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,270
Speaker 1: Well, it's, you know, yeah, pretty much.

526
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:11,130
Speaker 0: Because the protocols, like when I was in the hospital and I would go into the neonatal care ward to do whatever work, I would wash my hands up to the elbow for a full two minutes and 30 seconds.

527
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:11,812
Speaker 1: Right.

528
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:15,170
Speaker 1: See, it's all about, right, the soap only matters barely.

529
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,550
Speaker 0: And washing meant rubbing my hands against each other like this constantly.

530
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:18,990
Speaker 0: Yes.

531
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,469
Speaker 0: To the point that they got hot and hurt.

532
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,143
Speaker 1: The friction is what matters.

533
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:22,830
Speaker 1: How long.

534
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,708
Speaker 0: That could be said about many human endeavors.

535
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,670
Speaker 1: Covering all the possible skin areas.

536
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,686
Speaker 0: That could also be said about many human endeavors.

537
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,290
Speaker 0: I cover all the possible skin areas with constant friction.

538
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,140
Speaker 1: Lots of friction for a long period of time.

539
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,690
Speaker 1: That is what makes your hands clean.

540
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,605
Speaker 0: Maybe not that long of a period of time.

541
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:41,510
Speaker 0: You can only go so long.

542
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,739
Speaker 1: But the other things matter hardly at all compared to that factor.

543
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,869
Speaker 0: And you just didn't even acknowledge it.

544
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:59,449
Speaker 1: So if you care about getting your hands clean after you touch something dirty, you know, when you're touching dirty things, then make sure you apply lots of friction for a long time.

545
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,243
Speaker 0: So there, we did some science.

546
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:05,210
Speaker 0: Now we're going to talk about a whole bunch of business stuff.

547
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,530
Speaker 1: I'm going to try to make it as technological as possible.

548
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:11,969
Speaker 1: Even though it's mostly business news.

549
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,770
Speaker 0: So the rumor over the weekend was that either Facebook or Yahoo was going to ruin Tumblr.

550
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,880
Speaker 0: And it ends up that Yahoo won the contest.

551
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,610
Speaker 0: They're the ones who are going to ruin Tumblr.

552
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:22,150
Speaker 1: Hooray, I guess.

553
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:28,809
Speaker 0: I love how the media, like the mainstream media, is actually reporting, "Yes, Yahoo says they won't ruin

554
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:28,909
Speaker 0: it.".

555
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,255
Speaker 1: Let me tell you something.

556
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:33,090
Speaker 1: I've worked for two different companies that were acquired.

557
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:35,562
Speaker 1: And I remained working at both of them afterwards.

558
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:37,070
Speaker 1: In fact, I'm still working at one of them, right?

559
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:43,614
Speaker 1: And whenever you are acquired, the company that is buying you, right, is going to say, "Nothing's going to change.

560
00:27:43,715 --> 00:27:45,301
Speaker 1: Carry on, carry on.

561
00:27:45,602 --> 00:27:46,485
Speaker 1: Don't worry.

562
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:47,328
Speaker 1: Everything's going to be

563
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:47,830
Speaker 1: awesome.".

564
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:51,670
Speaker 1: And they basically say anything to assuage any fear that you may have.

565
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,521
Speaker 1: And 100% of the time, they are 100% lying.

566
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:57,609
Speaker 1: They bought you because they want to do something different with you.

567
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:01,270
Speaker 1: And once they get their hands on you, they own you and they do whatever the fuck they want.

568
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,126
Speaker 1: And nothing they said in some promise means a shit.

569
00:28:06,146 --> 00:28:07,110
Speaker 1: You can't hold them to that.

570
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:07,551
Speaker 1: That's why

571
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:23,290
Speaker 0: at least the company I worked for before had a poison pill, where basically if the company was bought out, it was awesome for the employees because it put such onerous requirements on them to pay ridiculous severance packages to basically prevent anyone from buying us out who wasn't going to do what we wanted anyway.

572
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,491
Speaker 0: Yeah.

573
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:31,150
Speaker 1: I mean, just today, Dave Weiner, the RSS-inventing guy, posted a story about how he was once acquired by Yahoo, right?

574
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:34,069
Speaker 0: I think at one point everyone's been acquired by Yahoo.

575
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,861
Speaker 1: Or it might have been Google or something.

576
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,070
Speaker 1: Someone bought him, right?

577
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:45,089
Speaker 1: And, you know, they basically, you know, while he was being bought, they told him, "Yeah, you'll be head of web strategy, whatever, whatever," right?

578
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:46,237
Speaker 1: And he was like, "Sweet.

579
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:46,681
Speaker 1: Okay.".

580
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:47,709
Speaker 1: So he agreed to it.

581
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:54,310
Speaker 1: And then he talks about how he set up a meeting, right, to talk about, oh, I think it was like Symantec, maybe, or McAfee.

582
00:28:54,951 --> 00:28:57,320
Speaker 1: And how, you know, to present the web strategy.

583
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,710
Speaker 1: And only the president was showed up and no one else showed up.

584
00:29:00,231 --> 00:29:02,949
Speaker 1: And he was sort of like, you know, "Where the fuck is

585
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:03,030
Speaker 1: he?".

586
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,127
Speaker 1: You know, when he started, the guy basically stopped him and was like, "All right, it's enough of

587
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:06,308
Speaker 1: that.".

588
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:08,037
Speaker 1: And he's like, "But what the fuck?

589
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:10,409
Speaker 1: I was supposed to be the chief of web strategy,

590
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:10,670
Speaker 1: whatever.".

591
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,282
Speaker 1: He's like, "Yeah, we just told you that so you would agree to be acquired.

592
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:14,789
Speaker 1: What the fuck do you think this

593
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:14,890
Speaker 1: is?".

594
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:15,893
Speaker 1: Right?

595
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:17,718
Speaker 1: This is how the business world works.

596
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:22,070
Speaker 1: When a company buys another company, they will fuck it up eventually, right?

597
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,837
Speaker 1: The only counter examples we have to this are Disney.

598
00:29:25,857 --> 00:29:31,850
Speaker 1: What Disney likes to do when they buy people, right, is let them roll for a while, right?

599
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,253
Speaker 1: And then fuck them up, right?

600
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,575
Speaker 1: It's like Disney buys Marvel.

601
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:42,550
Speaker 1: They just let the status quo continue into, like, all the contracts and pre-extending agreements that Marvel had sort of expire.

602
00:29:43,011 --> 00:29:52,130
Speaker 1: And thus, you know, sort of open up the freedom for Disney to do what they want with it without, you know, fucking anyone over or breaking any deals or causing any legal troubles, right?

603
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,770
Speaker 1: So, like, if Disney buys you, yeah, shit will continue, you know, as it has for about a year and then you're fucked.

604
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:04,570
Speaker 1: So, considering Tumblr makes no money, Yahoo makes no money, Yahoo buys Tumblr, they're gonna fuck it up.

605
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,169
Speaker 1: So, they might actually, it's possible they can make it better, right?

606
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,392
Speaker 0: The thing is, here's what worries me.

607
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:19,010
Speaker 0: Tumblr is the refuge of artists, pornographers, and kids who want to have a way to share stuff that isn't mom book.

608
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,450
Speaker 0: Because Facebook has mom on it now and the kids can't talk about the things they actually want to talk about.

609
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:33,950
Speaker 0: Tumblr has the sort of combination of being a blog and a social network and being semi-anonymous and not tied to the Facebook that their mom and dad in school all know about.

610
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:43,930
Speaker 1: It also sort of has, you know, unlike Facebook and other things where, like, your Tumbles are tied to people, right, like Google Plus, you can just have one account and make a bunch of Tumbles, right?

611
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I have the Radio Free Equestria one just in there and Tumblr.

612
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:55,490
Speaker 1: And the one thing that Tumblr has that no one else has is sort of, like, something.tumblr.com, like, I have pixelmeet.tumblr.com.

613
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,790
Speaker 0: You realize that something something.tumblr.com replaced the "That's the name of my cover band" joke.

614
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:04,650
Speaker 1: Exactly, it's like obscurevideogames.tumblr.com.

615
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:12,728
Speaker 0: I'm actually, I started Go Pro-ing every morning and as soon as I get enough, I'm going to start a Tumblr that something along the lines of "Jackass is riding the wrong way in one way bike

616
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:12,948
Speaker 0: lanes."

617
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:13,650
Speaker 0: Tumblr.com.

618
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,976
Speaker 1: Right, it's just a collection of specific things.

619
00:31:16,036 --> 00:31:21,089
Speaker 1: It's almost like supercut of somethingintheworld.tumblr.com.

620
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:23,032
Speaker 0: Where is it?

621
00:31:23,052 --> 00:31:23,433
Speaker 0: Where is it?

622
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:24,054
Speaker 0: Did someone make it?

623
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:30,670
Speaker 0: Someone made a Tumblr that was "African American women wearing Google Glass" and there's no entries to prove a point.

624
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,890
Speaker 0: Because someone else, because someone else made the Tumblr of white men wearing Google Glass.

625
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,837
Speaker 1: That's Tumblr, so that whole thing could be ruined.

626
00:31:41,877 --> 00:31:44,483
Speaker 1: But, like, for now, they're saying all the right things.

627
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,648
Speaker 1: They're saying, like, "Oh, we're not going to take the porn off Tumblr.

628
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:47,570
Speaker 1: Nope, we're not going to ruin

629
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,630
Speaker 1: it.".

630
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,590
Speaker 0: Okay, don't actually try to search for that because I just found a lot of porn.

631
00:31:51,932 --> 00:31:52,052
Speaker 1: Right.

632
00:31:52,413 --> 00:32:00,290
Speaker 1: But, like I said, companies that are buying other companies say the right thing in the period before and after the acquisition.

633
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:11,290
Speaker 1: So that A) the people who are being acquired will agree to it and B) they don't create an immediate PR nightmare, right, if they start changing things, you know, while everyone is paying attention to that.

634
00:32:12,393 --> 00:32:12,988
Speaker 1: No, they just started.

635
00:32:16,112 --> 00:32:19,378
Speaker 1: Right, so as soon as, you know, they acquire someone, they're in the news.

636
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,982
Speaker 1: They don't want that news to be accompanied with bad PR news.

637
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:26,230
Speaker 1: They'll wait for another time period to put in the second news of we're changing everything.

638
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:36,990
Speaker 0: Now, that is why this is interesting because Yahoo, you know, they all announced that this Tumblr acquisition is happening and then immediately has the Flickr announcement that they're updating Flickr.

639
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:40,590
Speaker 1: And then, unlike Google, they updated it immediately.

640
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,868
Speaker 0: I know, we both immediately were like, "All right, I went to my Flickr and just like, 'Hey, everything's different now,'.

641
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:46,249
Speaker 0: but not

642
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:46,450
Speaker 0: really.".

643
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:51,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, when Google updated Google Plus, you know, like earlier in the week, that shit wasn't updated until the end of the day.

644
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:52,153
Speaker 0: Well, you know why?

645
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:53,198
Speaker 0: You know why that is?

646
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,830
Speaker 0: Yahoo only has, what, like four users to deal with?

647
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:03,600
Speaker 1: Seriously, Google, you can just update your shit everywhere instantly at the same moment as your I/O press conference thingy.

648
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:12,660
Speaker 0: But that's telling because remember, Yahoo's under new management and it takes a long time for that change in management to trickle down and actually have an effect on the things the company does.

649
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:20,360
Speaker 0: The fact that Yahoo, you know, with Flickr, I was pretty much afraid for the last three years that they were going to shut Flickr down.

650
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,480
Speaker 1: Like they fucked up Delicious?

651
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,462
Speaker 0: Yeah.

652
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:25,731
Speaker 0: Because Flickr in particular, nothing competes with it.

653
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:29,020
Speaker 0: There's no alternative to Flickr for someone like me.

654
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,241
Speaker 1: Right.

655
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:30,345
Speaker 1: Now, you might say, "Wait a minute.

656
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,634
Speaker 1: There's like a zillion photo sharing sites all over the

657
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:32,956
Speaker 1: Internet.".

658
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:33,920
Speaker 1: But that is not true.

659
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:36,960
Speaker 0: I have like 500 gigabytes of photos.

660
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,928
Speaker 1: Well, Flickr's giving you a terabyte free.

661
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:40,055
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, that Flickr.

662
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:40,880
Speaker 1: That's the only good one.

663
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,338
Speaker 0: Yeah.

664
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,508
Speaker 1: And for like a small fee, they'll give you unlimited space.

665
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:45,029
Speaker 1: Guess what?

666
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,473
Speaker 1: Freaking Picasa.

667
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:49,180
Speaker 1: They charge you for the space like per gigabyte or whatever.

668
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, they give you free uploads only if you upload low resolution shit photos.

669
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,041
Speaker 0: Yeah.

670
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:58,940
Speaker 1: If you do the math, if you uploaded like all your raw photos to freaking Picasa, cost you a fucking fortune.

671
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,905
Speaker 0: Well, like here's the example of why this is.

672
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:04,818
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is actually hosted on Libsyn, but Libsyn is just a reseller of AWS.

673
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:06,373
Speaker 1: Well, S3.

674
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,112
Speaker 0: S3, which is part of AWS.

675
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:09,963
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

676
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:12,438
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's basically what they do as far as we can see.

677
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,739
Speaker 1: I think Libsyn has some of their own servers, too.

678
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,163
Speaker 0: Yeah.

679
00:34:15,243 --> 00:34:21,699
Speaker 0: And they do a lot of stuff where they'll archive things to another server, but there is some Amazon going on in the back end.

680
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:44,820
Speaker 0: So if we were to pay ourselves to use Amazon to host Geek Nights for the amount of data we have up and the number of downloads, because not every individual episode is not the end of the world, but the fact that some episode from 2006 gets downloaded like four times, there's a lot of old episodes, it would cost us like a thousand dollars a month.

681
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,399
Speaker 1: So it would cost a fucking ton of money.

682
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:50,679
Speaker 0: And that's not even if we're doing like raws or higher quality or anything.

683
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,820
Speaker 0: So we're basically paying a lot less for the service, partly because we're a heavy user.

684
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,499
Speaker 0: A lot of other people pay for it, don't use it nearly as much as we do.

685
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,178
Speaker 0: I mean, how many podcasts have listeners?

686
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,460
Speaker 0: I mean, even we're in the single digits.

687
00:35:07,782 --> 00:35:09,166
Speaker 0: So it's the same thing with Flickr.

688
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:13,240
Speaker 0: Most people who pay for Flickr don't have that much on Flickr.

689
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:27,640
Speaker 0: But then there's people like us who have a nice fancy camera, take a lot of pictures and want to store the raw, gigantic images for infinite posterity online somewhere and share those gigantic raw images with people willy nilly.

690
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:34,860
Speaker 0: Anyway, the new Flickr is pretty great because the way they make all superficial changes right now, but they look great, actually.

691
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it used to be that like you browse Flickr and you get like one photo at a time and most of the screen was white space.

692
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,726
Speaker 1: And, you know, white space is important in web design.

693
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:46,720
Speaker 1: But I think when you've got just a ton of photos, the new Flickr just fills the screen with the photos.

694
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,040
Speaker 1: Well, the old Flickr, which looks great and it looks is really efficient.

695
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,860
Speaker 0: The old Flickr looked great for its time.

696
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,478
Speaker 1: Exactly.

697
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,440
Speaker 0: I mean, back then, all white space everywhere was the way things looked.

698
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:07,060
Speaker 1: The old Flickr basically had the YouTube layout, right, where you have, you know, the main focus is one photo, comments under it, you know, stuff hanging out on the right side and navigation across the top.

699
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,421
Speaker 1: Right.

700
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:09,851
Speaker 1: And that was sort of in a way invented that.

701
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:12,280
Speaker 1: I think Flickr is older than YouTube, right?

702
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, Flickr.

703
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,320
Speaker 1: Sort of invented that standard layout there.

704
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,688
Speaker 0: You're talking older than YouTube.

705
00:36:16,749 --> 00:36:18,019
Speaker 0: I was using Flickr at RIT.

706
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,374
Speaker 0: YouTube didn't even start going, wasn't available until what?

707
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:25,577
Speaker 0: It was eight years.

708
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:27,040
Speaker 0: It was like 2005?

709
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,578
Speaker 1: Something like that.

710
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:28,779
Speaker 0: I will look up the dates.

711
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,948
Speaker 1: I think YouTube was '07 maybe.

712
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:31,751
Speaker 1: '05, I don't know, '04.

713
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:32,233
Speaker 1: I don't know.

714
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:41,360
Speaker 0: I'll look it up, but I am both optimistic and pessimistic about Foundation Day, February 14, 2005.

715
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,699
Speaker 1: So find Flickr's date.

716
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,762
Speaker 0: So think about that.

717
00:36:44,163 --> 00:36:51,540
Speaker 0: YouTube today is the be-all and all source of the majority of the entertainment of the internet generation.

718
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,668
Speaker 0: It did not exist when Scott and I were in high school.

719
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:58,400
Speaker 0: It did not exist until we were about to graduate from university.

720
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,859
Speaker 0: There wasn't video on the internet the entire time we were at RIT.

721
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:05,200
Speaker 1: It was barely, barely video on the internet.

722
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,970
Speaker 0: Bittorrent was not commonly used.

723
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,794
Speaker 0: We would use Hotline.

724
00:37:09,302 --> 00:37:09,553
Speaker 0: Yeah.

725
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,217
Speaker 0: Napster.

726
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:11,635
Speaker 1: WinMX.

727
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,356
Speaker 0: OpenNAP.

728
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,377
Speaker 1: Direct Connect.

729
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:14,800
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

730
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,470
Speaker 1: It was the peer-to-peer glory days.

731
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:17,840
Speaker 1: Anyway.

732
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:22,820
Speaker 0: Anyway, but I have a positive point and a negative point, or I guess an optimistic and a pessimistic thing.

733
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,626
Speaker 0: Optimistically, the fact that Yahoo!

734
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:34,560
Speaker 0: bought Tumblr is not that troubling in light of the fact that they actually are doubling down on Flickr, which is what they said they were going to do way back when this change in management happened.

735
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,217
Speaker 0: I believe the quote was something like, "Instagram should have never even had the chance to

736
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:38,579
Speaker 0: exist.".

737
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:45,600
Speaker 0: That should have just been basic functionality, one right click among many, one app among many tied to Flickr.

738
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:45,956
Speaker 1: Yep.

739
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,508
Speaker 0: We missed the boat and we're coming back.

740
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:49,520
Speaker 0: I'm paraphrasing liberally.

741
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:54,300
Speaker 0: But they didn't do anything, so that was just all empty promises.

742
00:37:54,942 --> 00:38:02,180
Speaker 0: But now they did the changes to Flickr as a signal right after the Tumblr thing, so maybe they are going to do this.

743
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,294
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe they're trying to show you like, "Look, we bought Tumblr and here's what we did to Flickr.

744
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:07,358
Speaker 1: Expect that for

745
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:07,759
Speaker 1: Tumblr.".

746
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,949
Speaker 0: So here's why I'm pessimistic.

747
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,360
Speaker 0: How the fuck does Tumblr make money?

748
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:13,277
Speaker 1: I don't know.

749
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,449
Speaker 0: There's no ads.

750
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:15,300
Speaker 0: The CEO hates ads.

751
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,800
Speaker 1: I thought there was like one ad on the side.

752
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,143
Speaker 1: Where?

753
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:18,560
Speaker 0: I've never seen an ad.

754
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:19,080
Speaker 1: Okay.

755
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:21,997
Speaker 0: And there's a very sort of...

756
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:24,920
Speaker 1: Maybe people put Project Wonderful on their Tumbles.

757
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,980
Speaker 0: There's a very sort of indie anti-advertising sentiment in the Flickr community as well.

758
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,627
Speaker 1: Tumblr.

759
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:31,157
Speaker 1: Uh, Flickr, yeah.

760
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:31,739
Speaker 0: Tumblr, Tumblr.

761
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,405
Speaker 1: Well, both.

762
00:38:32,486 --> 00:38:33,399
Speaker 1: And neither side has ads.

763
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:33,821
Speaker 0: Yeah.

764
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:38,060
Speaker 0: Well, it says that one perk of me paying for Flickr is no ads.

765
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:38,940
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

766
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,186
Speaker 0: Yeah.

767
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:40,700
Speaker 1: I've never seen ads on Flickr.

768
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,889
Speaker 0: Well, I've been running ad blocks since like 1994, so...

769
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:47,098
Speaker 1: That's true.

770
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:52,539
Speaker 0: Back when ad block consisted of a host file for the five known IPs that ads came from...

771
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,239
Speaker 1: Flickr's the right price, so we're good.

772
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:54,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

773
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:58,760
Speaker 0: Flickr was founded almost exactly a year before YouTube.

774
00:38:58,924 --> 00:38:59,139
Speaker 1: Okay.

775
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,559
Speaker 0: So both very old and not that old at all.

776
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:10,800
Speaker 0: But Yahoo, struggling on revenue, struggling to be relevant in the modern era, can't compete with Google in terms of advertising.

777
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,250
Speaker 0: Yeah.

778
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:13,640
Speaker 0: How is Yahoo going to be a successful company?

779
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,539
Speaker 0: Flickr costs way too little, in my opinion, for them to make huge amounts of money off of it.

780
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:23,237
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'd keep using it if they charged more.

781
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:28,479
Speaker 1: Well, as long as they're cheaper than everyone else... I'd kind of be forced to use it.

782
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,500
Speaker 0: But if it costs the same...

783
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,560
Speaker 1: If it costs the same, I'll just switch to Picasa.

784
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,181
Speaker 0: Exactly.

785
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,653
Speaker 0: If it costs the same as Picasa, I would use Picasa.

786
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:36,000
Speaker 0: I like Picasa a lot better.

787
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,219
Speaker 1: Well, I don't actually like Picasa better, but it's a Google thing, so I can trust it more.

788
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:40,574
Speaker 0: Yeah.

789
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,480
Speaker 0: But Tumblr, they're going to get all these users.

790
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,640
Speaker 0: How are they going to integrate with and monetize with Tumblr?

791
00:39:48,063 --> 00:39:48,940
Speaker 0: I can't imagine.

792
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:52,080
Speaker 0: No one using Tumblr wants to use a Yahoo ID to manage it.

793
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,100
Speaker 0: The whole point of Tumblr is that it's pretty pseudo-anonymous.

794
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:57,439
Speaker 1: I don't know.

795
00:39:58,022 --> 00:40:01,640
Speaker 1: A lot of companies these days buy companies without strategies, right?

796
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,080
Speaker 1: And it's like, I wonder, what is your strategy here?

797
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:11,259
Speaker 1: I see this happen a lot, is companies buy companies because some business people look at the books and they say, aha, this will be a winning move.

798
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:12,800
Speaker 1: Look at these numbers.

799
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:16,140
Speaker 1: But they don't actually have a strategy of what to do with the company after they bought it.

800
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,540
Speaker 0: Tumblr has a huge market in the demographic that people are so desperate to chase and can't.

801
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,439
Speaker 1: So on paper, it looks great, but what are you actually going to fucking do?

802
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,359
Speaker 0: And that's what I can't figure out, because if they integrate it too much with Yahoo's existing stuff, no one's going to want anything to do with it.

803
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,520
Speaker 1: Maybe they're going to put all Yahoo stuff into Tumblr, right?

804
00:40:35,843 --> 00:40:36,478
Speaker 1: Go the other way.

805
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,720
Speaker 0: But then how does that make Yahoo money?

806
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:39,737
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know.

807
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,366
Speaker 0: And maybe Yahoo could go the route of.

808
00:40:42,406 --> 00:41:00,359
Speaker 0: they have high quality services like advanced Tumblr and Flickr, and you get a free version that everyone uses, you get this kind of really big user base, but then you charge your expert users to sort of fund the next step and the professional producers who put their professional stuff in.

809
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,340
Speaker 1: That's actually not a bad strategy.

810
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,780
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like, you know, you got this Facebooks and the Googles sort of competing for like this mass, right, whatever.

811
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:15,500
Speaker 1: Flickr could be like, you know, Yahoo could be like, we are the company that owns the web apps that are the highbrow web apps, right?

812
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:22,220
Speaker 1: You know, like the Flickers and now the Tumbles and this, you know, start collecting them and be like, we manage the highbrow web apps.

813
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:29,939
Speaker 1: And it's like, that's actually, you know, if they keep up with that, like the way they've been going with Flickr and they go that strategy, I'd probably end up being using a lot of their shit.

814
00:41:30,301 --> 00:41:30,502
Speaker 0: Yeah.

815
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:34,340
Speaker 0: Granted, they're the ones who betrayed all those Chinese distance to the Chinese government.

816
00:41:34,687 --> 00:41:34,919
Speaker 0: Yeah.

817
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,460
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, at least Google tries to stand up for that stuff.

818
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:41,240
Speaker 1: And Yahoo, I think, still makes a lot of money from like Japan, right?

819
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,978
Speaker 1: They have like, Yahoo Auctions there is huge.

820
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,880
Speaker 0: And Yahoo Games is super popular among the 40 to 70 year old hearts player demographic.

821
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:52,640
Speaker 1: That hearts and backgammon and shit that's been on YouTube.

822
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:58,000
Speaker 1: Not only is it still the best, it's the exact same one that was on there when I was in high school.

823
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,210
Speaker 1: They haven't updated it for shit.

824
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,300
Speaker 1: It's like this Java applet.

825
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,460
Speaker 0: I used to play hearts on that shit like every day when I was a kid.

826
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,225
Speaker 1: In high school.

827
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:06,500
Speaker 1: So the late 90s, that's how old that shit is.

828
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,827
Speaker 1: Yahoo Games is ancient.

829
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:08,771
Speaker 1: They haven't changed it.

830
00:42:08,812 --> 00:42:10,379
Speaker 1: Those apps are still running today.

831
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,500
Speaker 1: And it's, you know, I guess they have ads on it so they make money on it.

832
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:25,080
Speaker 0: You know, it's interesting because, you know, when I realized the reason I don't know a lot about Tumblr, I was trying to think about the monetization stuff we're talking about, is that Tumblr doesn't have documentation and kind of just throws you into the middle.

833
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,976
Speaker 0: You just kind of figure it out.

834
00:42:26,422 --> 00:42:26,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't.

835
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:29,614
Speaker 1: Tumblr doesn't have a lot of meta, right?

836
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:30,540
Speaker 1: Like other things do.

837
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,920
Speaker 0: So apparently, according to an interview, David Carp said that Tumblr was monetized by advertising.

838
00:42:35,982 --> 00:42:36,023
Speaker 0: OK.

839
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,111
Speaker 0: I've never seen an ad.

840
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:39,060
Speaker 0: I don't know how the ads exist in Tumblr.

841
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,559
Speaker 1: Maybe you're blocking them just like you are in Flickr?

842
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,141
Speaker 1: Maybe.

843
00:42:41,502 --> 00:42:46,097
Speaker 0: But if I, a technologist, literally didn't know.

844
00:42:46,137 --> 00:42:56,800
Speaker 0: a company advertises because my default ad blocking is so good that I've never seen one, how do they think that that's not going to be every user's experience in the long run?

845
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,826
Speaker 1: In the long run.

846
00:42:57,846 --> 00:42:58,390
Speaker 1: But you know what?

847
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,600
Speaker 1: That's the super long run.

848
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,200
Speaker 0: Why doesn't everyone run ad block?

849
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:05,620
Speaker 1: There's a few people who have like, you know, but most people, I don't fucking know.

850
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,645
Speaker 1: I still don't get that.

851
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:09,340
Speaker 1: It's not like ad blocks hidden now.

852
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,618
Speaker 1: It's real easy to turn on.

853
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:15,840
Speaker 1: There's a few handful of people that have like, you know, like a stand, like they want ads.

854
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,406
Speaker 0: But you know what?

855
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:17,300
Speaker 1: That's not most people.

856
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:17,688
Speaker 1: Yeah.

857
00:43:18,281 --> 00:43:19,735
Speaker 1: It's just most people I guess are indifferent.

858
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:20,118
Speaker 1: I don't know.

859
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,560
Speaker 0: But apparently also, let's see, the average ad purchase on Tumblr is just under six figures.

860
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:28,359
Speaker 0: So they're not selling expensive ads.

861
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:28,797
Speaker 0: No.

862
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,859
Speaker 0: Under six figures.

863
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:32,113
Speaker 0: So just under six figures.

864
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:33,380
Speaker 0: What kind of metric is that?

865
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,429
Speaker 0: So $90,000 is what he's saying.

866
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:35,734
Speaker 1: Yeah.

867
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:36,799
Speaker 0: Is the average.

868
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,880
Speaker 0: Functionality lead Tumblr.

869
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:40,711
Speaker 0: Oh, this.

870
00:43:40,832 --> 00:43:41,276
Speaker 0: Okay.

871
00:43:41,336 --> 00:43:41,639
Speaker 0: Okay.

872
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:47,660
Speaker 0: During the first half of 2013, Tumblr will allow companies to pay to promote their own posts to larger audiences.

873
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,559
Speaker 0: They're going to monetize the same way Twitter's trying to monetize.

874
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:50,793
Speaker 0: Right.

875
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:57,040
Speaker 0: Those occasional annoying, intrusive, promoted tweets that everyone ignores.

876
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,338
Speaker 1: But in Tumblr, there's a setting where you can say, "Don't put anything in my dashboard that I do not

877
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:01,700
Speaker 1: follow.".

878
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:02,137
Speaker 1: And it works.

879
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,739
Speaker 1: So are they going to change that?

880
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,640
Speaker 0: I guess they're going to have to change that.

881
00:44:05,701 --> 00:44:06,689
Speaker 1: That setting goes away.

882
00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:07,758
Speaker 1: You can't get rid of the...

883
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:13,100
Speaker 0: They say that this functionality will lead Tumblr to profitability in 2013.

884
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,880
Speaker 0: So I guess they're not profitable.

885
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,880
Speaker 1: Maybe enough people don't turn the setting off.

886
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,320
Speaker 0: Tumblr also generates revenue by selling themes to users to change the appearance of their blog.

887
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:21,540
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea.

888
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,285
Speaker 1: That's not the worst.

889
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:24,020
Speaker 1: Most people can't fucking design for shit.

890
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,328
Speaker 1: And I hope that, you know...

891
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:33,580
Speaker 0: If they're going to make hats for other people to then buy in-game, then I have no problem with designers selling...

892
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:39,980
Speaker 1: They should, in fact, make a Tumblr-themed store where users can make Tumblr themes, put them in that store, and sell them to each other.

893
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,860
Speaker 1: And Tumblr would take a cut, just like Steam, Valve taking a cut on your hat.

894
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,752
Speaker 0: What amazes me is that Tumblr has received $125 million in funding so far.

895
00:44:48,865 --> 00:44:48,940
Speaker 1: Yep.

896
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:52,230
Speaker 1: You could have funded 125 $1 million companies.

897
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:55,900
Speaker 1: I could have funded... And probably would have been better off.

898
00:44:56,161 --> 00:45:03,240
Speaker 0: That could fund 12, like, not triple-A Blockbuster, but 12, like, A-level video games.

899
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of them's going to be a hit, guys.

900
00:45:05,464 --> 00:45:05,740
Speaker 0: Yeah.

901
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,759
Speaker 1: And it's going to make back a lot more than...

902
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,620
Speaker 0: And those video games, you just sell them and people give you money direct.

903
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:12,173
Speaker 1: Yeah.

904
00:45:14,627 --> 00:45:15,039
Speaker 0: We'll see.

905
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,670
Speaker 0: I'm really ambivalent.

906
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,680
Speaker 0: I can't tell if this is going to be good or bad.

907
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:29,420
Speaker 0: Either Yahoo's really turning everything around, or Yahoo is really setting itself up to explode, compete with Google, and then collapse.

908
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,707
Speaker 1: All right, so here's another story.

909
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,459
Speaker 1: Let's break away from that.

910
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:40,678
Speaker 1: So, you know, Valve recently, a few months ago, I guess, had this great purge where they fired, like, a whole bunch of people and everyone was like,

911
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:40,798
Speaker 1: "Whoa!"

912
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,056
Speaker 1: Right?

913
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:42,508
Speaker 1: Yeah.

914
00:45:43,421 --> 00:45:55,320
Speaker 1: Two of those people, former Valve hardware engineer Jerry Ellsworth and programmer Rick Johnson, right, were working on something that was basically some kind of goggles, right?

915
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,411
Speaker 1: And it's like Oculus Rift, Google Glass.

916
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,000
Speaker 1: Goggles are pretty hot right now, right?

917
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,659
Speaker 1: And they were working on goggles for Valve.

918
00:46:01,482 --> 00:46:05,980
Speaker 1: And they got fired and they decided to keep working on the goggles, even though they were not at Valve anymore.

919
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:15,020
Speaker 1: And apparently, you know, they went and they talked to the lawyers at Valve, and the Valve lawyers, it was pretty much like, you know, Gabe was like, "Let him have

920
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:15,080
Speaker 1: it.".

921
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,670
Speaker 1: And the lawyers were like, "Okay, it's yours.

922
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:17,475
Speaker 1: It's yours

923
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:17,737
Speaker 1: now.".

924
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:18,380
Speaker 1: You know?

925
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:26,680
Speaker 0: See, little things like that is why Valve has some of the only DRM I almost trust to be turned off if they went out of business.

926
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:29,579
Speaker 1: So the prototypes of these goggles look so shitty.

927
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:38,500
Speaker 1: But what they supposedly do is apparently amazing and totally different from what Oculus Rift or what Google Glass does.

928
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:44,399
Speaker 1: What Google Glass does is in the corner of your eye there's a tiny screen that you can look at and do stuff with, right?

929
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,026
Speaker 1: Oculus Rift is.

930
00:46:46,227 --> 00:46:48,540
Speaker 1: you are a TV on your face, right?

931
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:56,440
Speaker 1: What this is is that you see something in 3D out in the world in front of you.

932
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,740
Speaker 0: Meaning that's the true augmented reality visual overlay.

933
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,080
Speaker 1: That's what Glass has to become in the long run.

934
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,939
Speaker 1: Yes, these are the deno coil glasses that they're working on.

935
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:15,320
Speaker 1: And, you know, I think that, you know, in the short run, I don't think they'll have a product the way that Oculus Rift and Google Glass will have a product in the short term.

936
00:47:15,861 --> 00:47:23,040
Speaker 1: But I think on the second or third go around, when this shit is ready, if one of those two people doesn't buy them, right?

937
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:30,800
Speaker 1: They're pretty much going to kick everyone's ass because no one else is as far along in this direction as they are that I know of.

938
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,420
Speaker 0: I don't know, though, because I saw a thing about one of Google's patents was basically for their iteration of that.

939
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,080
Speaker 0: And people were saying that that was a prototype for Glass 2.

940
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:48,260
Speaker 1: Quite possibly, but I think these people might be, you know, from what things that the public has seen, they are the farthest along in that direction.

941
00:47:48,942 --> 00:47:49,043
Speaker 0: Yeah.

942
00:47:49,063 --> 00:47:51,280
Speaker 0: I mean, that's what I'm really waiting for.

943
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:51,902
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

944
00:47:52,324 --> 00:47:56,240
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, but I think they're mostly thinking of it in like a gaming direction.

945
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,273
Speaker 1: I mean, they're not obviously not strictly a gaming direction, right?

946
00:48:00,374 --> 00:48:01,880
Speaker 1: But they came from Valve, right?

947
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:07,940
Speaker 1: So, you know, walk down the street, you're playing Pac-Man, you see the dots just hovering in the middle of the street while you're walking down, right?

948
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,868
Speaker 1: You see the ghost coming at you, you turn and run away.

949
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,960
Speaker 1: That kind of shit is what this is going to do.

950
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,620
Speaker 1: So if I could only buy one of the three today, I would definitely get this one.

951
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,800
Speaker 0: Alright, I think we're about done because we gotta get ready for Anime Boston.

952
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta eat dinner too and finish the panel.

953
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,318
Speaker 0: I'm mad hungry.

954
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,656
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
