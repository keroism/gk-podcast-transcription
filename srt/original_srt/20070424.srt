1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,328
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday April 24th.

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,272
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:15,700
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:20,439
Speaker 0: Tonight we tickle your fancy with Tikal.

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:23,997
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:32,880
Speaker 0: So after all these years I finally finally I'm taking the goddamn train to work instead of driving and I got to say it's pretty terrific.

7
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:37,060
Speaker 1: Well, it's a good time to start cuz now you can train your pokemons on the train.

8
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:41,680
Speaker 0: I can and I did in fact train pokemons for about half the time on the train.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I can't train pokemons the whole time because I get tired and I try I fall asleep.

10
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:49,731
Speaker 1: But I got like two badges today.

11
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:50,755
Speaker 1: So I'm doing pretty good.

12
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:52,180
Speaker 0: Well, I go in and out of Pokemon.

13
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:54,000
Speaker 0: I actually played a lot more Phoenix, right?

14
00:00:54,521 --> 00:01:00,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I still hadn't beaten the Phoenix, right I would be playing that Exclusive of everything else until I beat it.

15
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:00,690
Speaker 0: Of course.

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,987
Speaker 0: I still got to play hotel dusk - oh, yeah You can wait on that one.

17
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:04,831
Speaker 1: It's not going anywhere.

18
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:05,799
Speaker 1: There's no rush on it.

19
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:08,056
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't have a terrible rush on the Pokemon.

20
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:12,174
Speaker 0: I'm in no Terrible hurry to start cock fighting with 12 year olds.

21
00:01:12,214 --> 00:01:21,126
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm pretty sure that this game people are still gonna be playing it and battling each other for some time to come and I mean no one.

22
00:01:21,326 --> 00:01:24,420
Speaker 1: no one really likes to battle until they've leveled up all their pokemons.

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:33,431
Speaker 1: So it's gonna be a while before everyone is leveled up all the way and then the real battling will start in a few months And by then I'll be alright pretty much.

24
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,460
Speaker 0: all I'm waiting for is I like mudkips.

25
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:38,130
Speaker 0: So I got to get three or four of them and they'll be set to go.

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's that hiker with three geodudes?

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:50,560
Speaker 0: I got him, okay But yeah surprisingly I get on the train and there's no seats because the train is absolutely full.

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:02:01,440
Speaker 0: I transferred onto the real a commuter train from the city except there's one seat and In the seat and it's empty and in the seat directly next to it is some punk gamer kid playing some game on a PSP.

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,259
Speaker 0: All right, so I sit down next to him and I open up my DS and I start playing on my DS.

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,567
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, and he looks over and I look at him.

31
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,310
Speaker 0: I nod.

32
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,914
Speaker 0: he nods we turn back to our games.

33
00:02:11,457 --> 00:02:13,063
Speaker 1: That's how it's done Yep.

34
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:16,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't say uh, you're no good.

35
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:19,183
Speaker 1: You didn't say uh, you're no good Botha gamer.

36
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:22,532
Speaker 0: Yeah granted not too long after that.

37
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:25,040
Speaker 0: I had a gay guy hit on me, but that's the story for another time.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:36,754
Speaker 1: Okay So I was driving out of the parking lot at the train station and You know I'd make a right turn out of the train station and coming up on the other side of the road.

39
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:39,143
Speaker 1: or is a car in Front of that car?

40
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:40,328
Speaker 1: are punk kids on bikes.

41
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,353
Speaker 1: Ah punk kids.

42
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:42,960
Speaker 1: These are probably middle school kids.

43
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:53,000
Speaker 1: Are they rolling around weaving slowing down train like they were good trying to bike as fast as they could to get away from the Car behind them because there wasn't really a sidewalk there and they were biking in the road, which is fine.

44
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,100
Speaker 1: But yeah, they were like, you know sort of racing somewhat like go go go go go, right.

45
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:58,305
Speaker 0: Well, that's what kids do.

46
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:59,410
Speaker 0: I mean they hurry up everywhere.

47
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,839
Speaker 0: They run as fast as they can in whatever direction to go And at any time, yep

48
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:10,538
Speaker 1: so you had three punk kids riding bikes as fast as they can straight and You know, I just try to pass them slowly on the right and then I'll be on my

49
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:10,800
Speaker 0: way.

50
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,874
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't want to accidentally kill a punk kid.

51
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:13,740
Speaker 1: No, it's not good.

52
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:21,912
Speaker 1: so as I'm driving up as is expected the kid the Punk kid in the rear just falls over.

53
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:23,680
Speaker 0: Why am I just like out of the blue?

54
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,836
Speaker 1: Well, he was sort of biking, you know crazily and his bike was going back and forth.

55
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:29,860
Speaker 1: He was doing the push push.

56
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,327
Speaker 0: Oh, he was a push pusher.

57
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:39,440
Speaker 0: Yeah for those who are unaware and Not that I mean, I'd like to mountain bike and I've out and bike forever, but even Scott knows this.

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:47,544
Speaker 0: So if you ever biking and you find that you stomp down one foot and then you stomp down another foot and you just stop Stop-stop back and forth.

59
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:48,728
Speaker 0: There's a term for that.

60
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:49,832
Speaker 0: It's called push push.

61
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:52,923
Speaker 1: Yes, you realize a bicycle is a Cycle.

62
00:03:53,123 --> 00:04:04,980
Speaker 1: you spin the gear which is a circle in a circle you keep pushing Constantly evenly without stopping and in fact you should on the upswing lift the foot up a little bit.

63
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,980
Speaker 0: So you're not resisting yourself and if you're really cool you get some clips.

64
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:12,993
Speaker 0: So when you're bringing your foot around you can actually pull up and add even more power.

65
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:13,796
Speaker 0: Yep.

66
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,060
Speaker 1: That's at a bicycle.

67
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:23,266
Speaker 1: So anyway, this funky it falls over like wham like suddenly like pedal pedal pedal floor and and you know The weather is all nice.

68
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:28,380
Speaker 1: So I just stopped right next to him and I'm like kid You all right, the people behind me were like honking.

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,143
Speaker 1: I was like whatever.

70
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:31,313
Speaker 1: and the kids, you know, he moves around.

71
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:32,639
Speaker 1: so I'm like, oh he's alive and he goes.

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,719
Speaker 0: well He moves around so he's on the ground squirming and gurgling.

73
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,971
Speaker 1: He was getting up even though his bike looked broken.

74
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:42,115
Speaker 0: well, of course he was getting up.

75
00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:42,938
Speaker 0: he was impaled.

76
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:46,969
Speaker 1: Yeah His bike his bike was obviously broken.

77
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,919
Speaker 1: I saw at least a pedal and possibly a handle broken off.

78
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:57,633
Speaker 0: See now now my guess here is that obviously he's a little chubby and he's pushing pushing That's a lot of force.

79
00:04:58,156 --> 00:05:04,698
Speaker 0: on that pedal Alternating he probably just snapped the pedal and went right down like a like a fat kid on a bike.

80
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:07,920
Speaker 1: probably He wasn't that fat, but he was definitely the fat kid.

81
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:22,273
Speaker 1: And yeah, he was pretty funny because when he was lying there he was like, ah I Got to admit I've done that a lot in my life.

82
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:38,130
Speaker 0: and when I saw that on Family Guy So in the news Jack Thompson, I Didn't think I'd ever have to talk about him again, but luckily it's over.

83
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:40,656
Speaker 0: We don't have to worry about Jack Thompson anymore.

84
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:45,870
Speaker 0: There is no chance that he will be newsworthy again until he dies.

85
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:49,379
Speaker 0: You see Jack Thompson is now irrelevant.

86
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,444
Speaker 0: He's I go over all the news.

87
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:51,545
Speaker 0: Wait.

88
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:53,550
Speaker 1: He's always been irrelevant.

89
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,796
Speaker 1: Well, I don't see what the news is.

90
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,103
Speaker 0: He's always been irrelevant.

91
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:57,570
Speaker 0: as far as smart people are concerned.

92
00:05:58,031 --> 00:06:07,103
Speaker 0: He was somewhat relevant to the media who for whatever reason lent him some credibility And he was very much relevant to parents who don't know anything.

93
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:10,575
Speaker 0: people paid attention to him Lawyers at least for a little while.

94
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:15,290
Speaker 0: this new him a little bit judges entertained his crazy notions at least nominally.

95
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:23,445
Speaker 1: But I have never seen any judge entertain his notions Generally, well generally he entertains the judges.

96
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:24,510
Speaker 1: Well, it's crazy notions.

97
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:28,509
Speaker 0: I guess I would say they entertain them and that they did not immediately have him locked up.

98
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:30,182
Speaker 1: They almost did.

99
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:30,706
Speaker 1: Yeah,

100
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:44,990
Speaker 0: they did But it's kind of come all the way around and just recently I don't even need to talk about what he's been doing lately because the media has started pointing out that he's a crazy Nutbag and that no one should listen to him and that he's just insane.

101
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,622
Speaker 0: Hooray, so I will not ever bother talking about Jack Thompson again.

102
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:56,381
Speaker 0: unless one he starts playing video games Or two he dies.

103
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:58,670
Speaker 0: one of the two is going to happen at some point.

104
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,406
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure he's at least played a video game once.

105
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:06,510
Speaker 1: mean he had you know What he's had to play a pac-man at some point, you know, at least a pac-man there's a chance.

106
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:15,597
Speaker 1: He never has there's a chance but I'm pretty sure he's played a pac-man and he's definitely at least seen Some games at some point.

107
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:16,740
Speaker 0: has he really?

108
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,682
Speaker 0: because I remember reading some of the things he said and he would make Statements that sound very much like the guy in 40 year old virgin.

109
00:07:23,702 --> 00:07:25,949
Speaker 0: We was trying to lie about how he'd had sex once.

110
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,757
Speaker 0: It's like touching a touching a sandbag.

111
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,600
Speaker 1: It's it's it's like a bag of sand.

112
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:38,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Luckily, I see your wife ago.

113
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:40,346
Speaker 0: Are you into photography?

114
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:41,289
Speaker 1: What's it like?

115
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:43,893
Speaker 0: But it's over.

116
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:51,056
Speaker 0: I had to say something because I'm actually kind of surprised that the media has turned on him just yet because I'd figure right around.

117
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:57,924
Speaker 0: now is when they'd want to push it one last time before they do the You know turn around take a different position on an issue.

118
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:59,289
Speaker 0: So suddenly it's news again.

119
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:05,508
Speaker 1: You know, it seems to me like the media in general is trying to do something different with the.

120
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:24,704
Speaker 1: you know The whole crazy VT whatever business, you know because every time and you know there's been something like this what ends up happening is the media reports on it the way they've been reporting on things for the past decade or so and The backlash against the way the media does that reporting increases every single time.

121
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,075
Speaker 1: So I think someone had the genius idea I don't know who it was.

122
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:33,941
Speaker 1: But whoever they are is smart to say hey Let's change it up and do things differently.

123
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:45,982
Speaker 1: so we don't get this annoying backlash You know because they got a really rough backlash from actually the people at Virginia Tech who were like, hey go home media We don't want you here and that they've never had that before.

124
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:47,506
Speaker 1: and I think that woke someone up.

125
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:51,418
Speaker 1: and it seems to me Like someone is paying attention to what blogs say.

126
00:08:51,438 --> 00:09:09,544
Speaker 1: and it seems like in a lot of like not just with the Virginia Tech thing But with a lot of things I get the feeling that real journalists are reading blogs and dig and that sort of thing Getting the general vibe of what those people are saying and then presenting it through their media in a you know Journalistic fashion,

127
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:17,550
Speaker 0: you know I really wouldn't be surprised because You can very quickly figure out the sentiments of the majority of internet people just by reading three or four forums.

128
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:23,448
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'll see where this goes but I really don't care either way.

129
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:24,170
Speaker 1: It's just interesting.

130
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:29,364
Speaker 1: Alright, so if you're cool, you don't just play video games.

131
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:31,250
Speaker 1: You also play the German board games.

132
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,580
Speaker 1: If you don't play the German board games, you're not cool.

133
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:33,961
Speaker 1: Sorry.

134
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:35,950
Speaker 1: I'm just I'm just sorry you suck.

135
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:39,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I didn't know about German board games until I got to college.

136
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:47,489
Speaker 1: Yeah well if you don't play the German board games There's still hope for you If you're not dead yet And you're not about to die because you have a chance to play them and become cool.

137
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:53,150
Speaker 1: Not only do you have a chance to play them and become cool, but you can play them without buying them.

138
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:57,966
Speaker 1: well without buying them physically and without having to find friends who can play them.

139
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:06,810
Speaker 1: because the two German board games that I would most highly recommend you play before any others are Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.

140
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:14,815
Speaker 1: and well Microsoft for some time is on the rights the video game rights to Settlers of Catan and I think they have a website where you Can play it for money.

141
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:33,617
Speaker 1: You have to pay them to be able to use it, but I supposedly really good and I think they just bought the video game rights to Carcassonne in the US and in May Settlers is gonna be on the Xbox Live and in June the Carcassonne is gonna be on the Xbox Live and there's a lot of screenshots and they look a pretty

142
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:39,657
Speaker 0: hot now despite the fact that Settlers is at its core a Terribly flawed game.

143
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:42,290
Speaker 1: Settlers is a terribly flawed game.

144
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:50,581
Speaker 1: If everyone knows how to play and everyone knows all the rules Then it pretty much just comes down to randomness who wins.

145
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:53,669
Speaker 0: and that was really put into relief when I entered the tournament.

146
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,470
Speaker 0: and But I think I've talked about that before.

147
00:10:55,618 --> 00:11:05,426
Speaker 0: Yeah But despite that a lot of people the fact I'd say the vast majority of people including gamers Including people who are really into all sorts of gaming really don't play the German board games.

148
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:06,490
Speaker 0: They just don't know about them.

149
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:10,390
Speaker 0: It's kind of a thing that you wouldn't think on your own to just go and get into.

150
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:13,506
Speaker 0: You need to see someone else and have them get you into it.

151
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:15,798
Speaker 0: in most cases I mean, that's how we all got into it.

152
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:16,562
Speaker 0: That's everyone.

153
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:26,990
Speaker 0: I know got into it and Putting a game like Settlers on Xbox Live like that is Perhaps the most perfect way to get people into German board gaming ever.

154
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:33,662
Speaker 1: But it does seem like, you know, we got into it when like 2000 ish 2002 ish maybe I don't know it was 2000.

155
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:37,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, and It seems like ever since then.

156
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:38,640
Speaker 1: It's just been growing.

157
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,128
Speaker 1: It's like no one ever on German board games.

158
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:43,222
Speaker 1: people only You know get into it.

159
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:44,069
Speaker 1: They never get out.

160
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:49,035
Speaker 0: Yeah at my worst you don't have enough time to play as many games as you want But you always want to play one.

161
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:53,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, as soon as you're into it, you're into it and I just see more and more people.

162
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,114
Speaker 1: It's totally spreading like a virus.

163
00:11:55,295 --> 00:12:05,084
Speaker 1: and you know first it's Settlers and then it's Carcassonne then you'll see people playing Puerto Rico and then it's teeny and the game's over.

164
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:10,081
Speaker 0: Yeah, once you hit teeny You're pretty much the hardest of hardcore board gamers as far as I can see.

165
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:10,923
Speaker 1: I could see.

166
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:21,930
Speaker 1: eventually like I'd say When we're old men like T&E will be as big like the biggest game like huge I mean really hopefully T&E in general.

167
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:25,447
Speaker 0: I'd like to talk about that some of the staying power of different kinds of games.

168
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:28,237
Speaker 0: because We despite how much we love board games.

169
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,043
Speaker 0: We still hate the majority of board games.

170
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:36,950
Speaker 0: It's already said over the years I think we own every board game that's ever been made that's worth playing.

171
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:41,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, except for the ones that just came out in Germany that we haven't are the ones we don't know about.

172
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,254
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we're many.

173
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:43,900
Speaker 0: we seek them out as best we can.

174
00:12:44,161 --> 00:13:07,035
Speaker 0: but despite the fact that Settlers is kind of a flawed game It's also a wonderful game especially if you've never played a game like that before because it has in it all of the elements that make German board gaming or euro gaming in general so different and so much more intellectually stimulating than American style board games and it encapsulates it all into this one simple game That's easy to understand.

175
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:20,259
Speaker 0: the game includes most importantly a lot of social elements And I can't wait to hear transcripts of some Xbox Live gamer kids with that Xbox Live chat Trying to trade brick and sheep and wood and grain.

176
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,222
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

177
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:23,530
Speaker 1: Yo dude hook me up with some leet bricks.

178
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,207
Speaker 0: Yo, man, I gotta tell you I need some sheep for this wood.

179
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:27,749
Speaker 0: I got here.

180
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:29,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't hold ten wood.

181
00:13:33,053 --> 00:13:41,050
Speaker 1: But so yeah Settlers, you know, it's one of those games where it's not a great game But it's like the perfect entry-level game.

182
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:53,139
Speaker 1: so it's sort of like how No one who's brand new to video gaming can really play Counter-Strike because it's sort of this advanced game That's you know Not easy on a complete the first time

183
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,680
Speaker 0: I played Counter-Strike and this is someone who had played Action Quake 2 for years.

184
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:05,447
Speaker 1: I literally would just die I couldn't do anything but someone who's played Counter-Strike will tell you that I don't know.

185
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:09,302
Speaker 1: Team Fortress Classic is a sucky game, you know, and it kind is.

186
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:16,369
Speaker 1: but if you've never played an FPS before Team Fortress Classic is like the game to play to learn how to play a team FPS.

187
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:20,609
Speaker 0: Yep, because once you once you play that game you've learned everything.

188
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:24,164
Speaker 0: now You can play weapons factory or Team Fortress 2 or whatever is coming out now.

189
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:25,450
Speaker 0: You'd have all the basics down.

190
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:29,910
Speaker 1: Yep, Carcassonne is the same way only it's actually a good game worth playing.

191
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,250
Speaker 1: So you can sort of get a double bonus here and that you're gonna play Settlers of Catan.

192
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:40,630
Speaker 1: learn how to play German board games get good at them learn to like them and Figure out why they're awesome.

193
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:45,310
Speaker 1: But eventually you're not gonna like Settlers anymore because you're gonna figure out everything that's wrong with it.

194
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:52,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless you're just dumb and then you're gonna get Carcassonne Which is a game that will learn you the next kind of German board game.

195
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:57,750
Speaker 1: get you into some tile laying action And then you're never gonna get bored with that one because it's actually good game.

196
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:08,550
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean despite how much we've played Carcassonne we still haven't solved it and We haven't determined that it's not random but nor have we in any way found evidence that it is random.

197
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:17,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, generally with the greater numbers of tiles the randomness decreases But at the same time with greater numbers of tiles the randomness increases.

198
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,593
Speaker 0: Yeah but the thing is the Real quick.

199
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:37,890
Speaker 0: the best way to tell if a game is random is once you play it with a few people enough and you've got A bunch of people, you know who are generally equally and/or maximally skilled at a game people who have played the game So much that they're super good at it that if they play it against someone with moderate skill They would just cream them without quest.

200
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:45,870
Speaker 1: Yeah For example, if I played against like three noobs at settlers I would win every single time because I'm better than they are.

201
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:56,890
Speaker 1: but if he played again if I played against rim and Alex Alex and someone else who is really good at settlers basically, you know, we would all be maximum good.

202
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:58,095
Speaker 1: No one could be better.

203
00:15:58,496 --> 00:15:59,721
Speaker 1: No one would win every time.

204
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:01,248
Speaker 1: it would just come down to the dice.

205
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:16,028
Speaker 0: Yep So if we played settlers a lot and eventually got to the point where the distribution of wins over time Averaged out to where everyone won an equal number of times and at that point We it was obvious that the game was actually random.

206
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:19,341
Speaker 1: at that point You might as well just roll a dice whoever rolls the highest number wins the end.

207
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:30,534
Speaker 0: now Carcassonne to this day there is still a very clear and frequent victor one person wins more often than everyone else always no matter what we do to the game and There's no way.

208
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:36,454
Speaker 0: randomness is the factor because everyone has generally equal playtime and Generally equal skills.

209
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:40,828
Speaker 0: So there are still tricks and things that make the game non random.

210
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:53,750
Speaker 1: Yep But yeah, these games are gonna be an Xbox Live and if you've got an Xbox, which we don't but you might and You should be playing these and not playing anything else on the Xbox because anything else in the Xbox isn't as good as this.

211
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:55,714
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I can't stress this enough.

212
00:16:55,814 --> 00:17:00,971
Speaker 0: settlers of Catan is I'd still would put it on a list of the ten most important board games ever Made.

213
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:04,983
Speaker 1: yeah, maybe not best but definitely most important and you know what it is best.

214
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,890
Speaker 0: just eventually you solve it you move on.

215
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:32,910
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you want to get a motorcycle you get a little 250 cc motorcycle You learn how to drive the motorcycle you're real good at and you're happy and then you realize that the 250 cc has a lot of limitations that you didn't know about because you didn't know about Motorcycles and you never ever ever want to ride the 250 cc motorcycle again and you get a thousand cc motorcycle But you still remember that 250 cc and you remember how important it was for you learning.

216
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,823
Speaker 0: Yep, and of course one final bit of news that I figure we should bring up.

217
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:39,953
Speaker 0: I heard PC gaming said oh Really?

218
00:17:39,973 --> 00:17:41,462
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard it was dead.

219
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:42,730
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that's old news.

220
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:45,621
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone plays PC games in the entire world.

221
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:46,465
Speaker 1: Really?

222
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:47,770
Speaker 0: I not at all.

223
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,955
Speaker 0: I mean that that's what I saw.

224
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:50,241
Speaker 0: I read it somewhere on the internet.

225
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:52,070
Speaker 1: Oh, you know all these Macs and Linux everywhere.

226
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:52,431
Speaker 1: It's not.

227
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,112
Speaker 1: it's not a surprise.

228
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:54,614
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean no one runs Windows.

229
00:17:54,634 --> 00:18:02,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

230
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:05,190
Speaker 0: I like mudkips things of the day.

231
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:15,550
Speaker 0: So we both got video game things of the day because of course it is well nominally gaming day But tonight video game day at least until we get into board games.

232
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:28,239
Speaker 0: We're actually talking about games all around anyway, a Lot of games especially on consoles have a lot of beta versions or test versions or test concept art or whatnot.

233
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:31,820
Speaker 0: That unlike with PC games never sees the light of day.

234
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:41,689
Speaker 1: Well, it does see the light of day just doesn't ever get seen by normal people Like if there's a beta of I don't know I never sees the light of the internet.

235
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:47,721
Speaker 0: common folk like myself and yourself Do not see the beta screenshots from Mario 1.

236
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:53,040
Speaker 1: No, because these games are developed by guys at a company in a place where there's high security.

237
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,007
Speaker 1: They're not allowed to take pictures.

238
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,011
Speaker 1: No one goes in.

239
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:58,240
Speaker 1: No one goes out except the guys working on it.

240
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:01,732
Speaker 1: Everyone's got contracts where they don't tell anyone anything.

241
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:07,360
Speaker 1: They don't give screenshots to any Reviewers or magazines until everything's already.

242
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:16,960
Speaker 0: also when they make versions a lot of times for testing they'll make Cartridges of it internal cartridges and things and it's not like a PC game when it's a cartridge game.

243
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:17,523
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

244
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:17,805
Speaker 0: Yeah.

245
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:19,899
Speaker 0: Well, that's what the games I'm looking at are.

246
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:32,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you see coin heaven has found a site called unseen 64 and there they have Beta screenshots from a whole host of games many of which aren't good or I'd never heard of.

247
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:34,753
Speaker 1: however Oh, I'm not a hundred percent sure.

248
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:35,800
Speaker 1: These are all real.

249
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,015
Speaker 1: I mean some of them probably are some aren't who knows but they're all cool.

250
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:40,556
Speaker 1: Nonetheless.

251
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,526
Speaker 0: Well, they're all from a site That's not in English.

252
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,900
Speaker 0: Aha, so be warned there.

253
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,700
Speaker 0: However one this is a bunch of screenshots from various early incarnations of various Mario games.

254
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:54,380
Speaker 0: I think my favorites are down at the bottom.

255
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,095
Speaker 0: There's a lot of stuff from what Super Mario World looked like when they were first working on it back when Mario 3 was still Fresh in their minds.

256
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:07,840
Speaker 1: Yep So that's my favorite actually because it shows you like how much Mario 3 was kept in the Super Mario world.

257
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,452
Speaker 1: They kept the question about the music note blocks.

258
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:23,058
Speaker 1: They kept the raccoon tail They kept all this stuff and then they kept the turtles, you know walking on all four legs instead of just the hind legs And it shows you just how much they changed during the development of that game.

259
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:26,271
Speaker 1: They basically started out with just Mario 3.

260
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:34,440
Speaker 0: my favorite picture here has to be hands-down The really creepy sad scary Luigi from whatever version of Luigi's Mansion.

261
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:41,279
Speaker 0: I don't know if this was actually gonna be in the game But if Luigi's Mansion had looked like this I would have been so much more likely to play it.

262
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:44,177
Speaker 1: I'm not a big fan of that picture there.

263
00:20:44,197 --> 00:20:44,700
Speaker 0: I don't know.

264
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,809
Speaker 0: I like that aesthetic a lot more than the goofy kind of New style that Luigi's Mansion actually was.

265
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,000
Speaker 0: yeah, I still can't believe you bothered beating that game.

266
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:55,840
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it was actually fun.

267
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,037
Speaker 1: It just wasn't long enough to be worth playing ever again, and there wasn't any replay value at all.

268
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:04,046
Speaker 1: So Luigi's Mansion is an okay game.

269
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:05,291
Speaker 1: It has some fun bits plus.

270
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:06,315
Speaker 1: There's a lot of booze.

271
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,660
Speaker 1: booze will always get me to play.

272
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:12,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know by the time you're catching your 90th general boo regard.

273
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:14,560
Speaker 1: It's only one general boo regard.

274
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,046
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, don't they all have different names?

275
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:18,316
Speaker 0: Yes, even though they're all actually identical.

276
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:19,159
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

277
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,300
Speaker 0: No, there's like several different archetypes or whatever, but it's mostly the same deal.

278
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:25,148
Speaker 1: Well, no pretty much each boo.

279
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,640
Speaker 1: There's like a trick you have to do to catch each one.

280
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,995
Speaker 1: That's what the game is like the puzzle of how do I catch this boo?

281
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:32,724
Speaker 0: That's the point I don't know.

282
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:34,617
Speaker 0: You just didn't look like you were having fun playing it.

283
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:39,040
Speaker 0: I spent a lot of your time yelling and complaining while I was sitting playing counter-strike next to you.

284
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:42,780
Speaker 1: I don't really remember complaining so much but I beat it and I'm done with it.

285
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,751
Speaker 0: I remember hearing a lot of all right.

286
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,374
Speaker 0: There he is.

287
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:47,912
Speaker 0: Fuck you wanna Went to the wall.

288
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:48,439
Speaker 0: Where'd he go?

289
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:51,217
Speaker 0: Another one.

290
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,780
Speaker 1: Ah, I don't remember that but it wasn't a very memorable game.

291
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:00,445
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll play it again.

292
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:04,199
Speaker 0: You know what you do that and I'll continue to train pokemons.

293
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:18,540
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm definitely gonna be training pokemons alright, so I think a long time ago one of my thing of the days was some preview images from a Art gallery that would be dealing with 8-bit arts or 8-bit related arts.

294
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,986
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

295
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:25,607
Speaker 1: at the gallery 1988 in LA Just a little while ago.

296
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,198
Speaker 1: They opened up a new show a new gab.

297
00:22:29,338 --> 00:22:29,960
Speaker 1: What do you call it?

298
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:34,710
Speaker 1: I don't know a show a gallery open an Exhibit exposition.

299
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,060
Speaker 1: I don't know called.

300
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:46,083
Speaker 1: I am 8-bit and it is awesome and these guys went to it on the opening night when it was crazy crowded and they took pictures of pretty much Everything there.

301
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:50,736
Speaker 1: So if you can't go to LA you can still see all the awesome arts.

302
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,140
Speaker 0: Thank you internet.

303
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:56,796
Speaker 1: Let me tell you a lot of these arts are freakin awesome.

304
00:22:56,957 --> 00:23:05,080
Speaker 1: Holy shits I mean some of them are better than others But goddamn some of them are the highest quality like I would buy if this was for sale.

305
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:07,539
Speaker 1: I would buy half of it to hang up on the walls in the house.

306
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:09,660
Speaker 0: I think that's part of why we go to cons.

307
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:22,672
Speaker 0: I spend most of my purchasing time in the artist alley especially like Otakon instead of the real dealers room because all the cool stuff are the Handmade custom art that's based on video games.

308
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:25,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta say some of my personal favorites.

309
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,829
Speaker 1: Well, my number one favorite is on the first page.

310
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:29,435
Speaker 1: It's right in the middle.

311
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:30,800
Speaker 1: It's the Donkey Kong one.

312
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:34,943
Speaker 1: It's hard to miss it and it's ah I want that.

313
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:38,380
Speaker 1: so if I had to pick just one thing here to get I would totally get that.

314
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:39,204
Speaker 0: I mean one.

315
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:46,048
Speaker 0: it's in that style that we both really really like - it Looks like a movie poster for an old movie.

316
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,031
Speaker 0: Yeah, three.

317
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:48,495
Speaker 0: It's Donkey Kong.

318
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:50,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's tough to beat that.

319
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:58,583
Speaker 0: I mean if we ever make a geek nights poster, I want it to be almost exactly like that only instead of a monkey It's us another.

320
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:17,500
Speaker 1: another notable favorites are like the homemade plushies that of the burger time guys the Donkey Kong's Last Supper The giant plastic rack full of a bajillion little clay miniatures of a zillion characters the swamp statue.

321
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:24,020
Speaker 1: There's so much good stuff here that if you're a fan of video games video game culture.

322
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:28,220
Speaker 1: You need to go look at everything here because it will entertain you greatly.

323
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:28,998
Speaker 0: You know what?

324
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,143
Speaker 0: You said the word swamp and my brain went off and I was thinking and I realized what would be an awesome Product.

325
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:40,568
Speaker 0: All right, so, you know a lot of people have Venetian blinds, but you know Sometimes you have those that you pull down.

326
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:43,880
Speaker 0: the plastic sheet that blocks the window entirely like the vinyl sheet.

327
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:49,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, what if you had one of those where both sides of it were a perfect image of a thwomp that you pull down?

328
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,682
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

329
00:24:51,063 --> 00:24:51,345
Speaker 0: I would.

330
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:52,529
Speaker 0: I want that in my window now.

331
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:53,332
Speaker 0: All right.

332
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:54,376
Speaker 1: Well you go do that.

333
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:55,239
Speaker 0: Okay, I will.

334
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,284
Speaker 1: oh I just see another really good one here it's got.

335
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:06,390
Speaker 1: I can't tell if it's a Mario or Luigi, but he's wearing the tanuki suit and He's warming his hands by a little fire with eyeballs.

336
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:07,554
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny.

337
00:25:08,095 --> 00:25:09,600
Speaker 0: Why is he with eyeballs?

338
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know the kind of fires that jump out.

339
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:14,902
Speaker 0: Oh the ones from the pyramid world in Mario 3.

340
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:16,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, that kind of fire.

341
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,497
Speaker 0: Yep a Charmander kind of fire.

342
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:24,888
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah that guy the Calcifer cat how does your matter make that little fire?

343
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:29,640
Speaker 1: Anyway, he's a fire Pokemon But it's a dragon breathe fire dragon breathing fire.

344
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:35,970
Speaker 0: I can understand but to be constantly on fire I mean, it's like those pipes that they have next to an oil field that keeps burning.

345
00:25:36,374 --> 00:25:38,069
Speaker 0: Is he just constantly putting gas out?

346
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:38,768
Speaker 1: I don't know.

347
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:41,721
Speaker 1: I also want to tell you one last thing about this art gallery.

348
00:25:41,762 --> 00:25:45,597
Speaker 1: if you go to page four and you scroll down You'll start seeing these.

349
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:47,745
Speaker 1: someone did some really good art of.

350
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:55,090
Speaker 1: they drew the mug shots From punch-out of all the bad guys starting with glass Joe and they drew all the guys, you know beaten up.

351
00:25:55,191 --> 00:26:13,269
Speaker 1: They didn't draw them, you know before they got beaten up They drew them post getting beaten up and you scroll down and it's like alright glass Joe Piston Honda You know King hippo Pot soda Popinski and and then at the bottom There's a really good joke that you should see.

352
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:20,230
Speaker 0: I'm because I haven't actually looked at this yet and Scott can vouch for that because he's been Constantly trying to make me go over there and look at most of these.

353
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:28,669
Speaker 0: I've seen a couple from a distance that he you know made me look up as he turns his laptop over but I've been mostly Being difficult and staying over here by my desk working on things.

354
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,660
Speaker 0: Is the last picture just little my little Mac.

355
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:35,850
Speaker 0: no cuz he lost and then Mike Tyson actually won.

356
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:36,957
Speaker 0: So it's not a picture of him.

357
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:38,870
Speaker 0: No, cuz that's the joke I would have made.

358
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,296
Speaker 1: It's a much better joke than that.

359
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:49,775
Speaker 0: It's a much more obvious joke that I can't believe you didn't figure out Alright, so Scott just showed it to me and I think my joke was a lot better than what's actually there Which is pretty lame.

360
00:26:49,815 --> 00:26:50,838
Speaker 1: I think it's a funny joke.

361
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:52,363
Speaker 0: That's a really unoriginal joke.

362
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:53,507
Speaker 1: I know it's unoriginal.

363
00:26:53,547 --> 00:26:54,350
Speaker 1: That's why it's funny.

364
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:57,119
Speaker 0: No, I would submit the opposite you suck.

365
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,650
Speaker 1: So anyway also props to the Katamari pac-man.

366
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:16,894
Speaker 0: So tonight we are reviewing as we are want to do an old board game partly because we don't have so many new board games though at Gaming for hope we did in fact play a board game that we are going to be talking about as soon as we buy it So we can play it again.

367
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:20,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not a hundred percent sure that it's a game with infinite staying power.

368
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:27,530
Speaker 1: Oh, it's definitely not I'm sure that but it's definitely an awesome fun game that we are going to recommend to you.

369
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,044
Speaker 1: But we will not talk about that now.

370
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:34,650
Speaker 0: tonight We will talk about another game a game that isn't nearly as good as that game, but it's still a fun game.

371
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:41,497
Speaker 0: It's also this game has a lot of nostalgia for me because it's one of the first board games I ever bought after I got into German gaming.

372
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:42,098
Speaker 0: Yep.

373
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:46,250
Speaker 0: It was pretty much this El Grande and settlers that I got right away.

374
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:51,323
Speaker 1: Well, the game we were about to talk about is the winner of the 1999 spiel des Jahres and the 1999 deutsches spiel prize.

375
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:59,386
Speaker 1: It is designed by Wolfgang Cramer and published and Michael keel sing.

376
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:02,418
Speaker 0: I only know Cramer I don't know the other guys either.

377
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:03,804
Speaker 1: I thought it was only Wolfgang Cramer.

378
00:28:03,844 --> 00:28:04,568
Speaker 1: That's why I hesitated.

379
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:17,809
Speaker 1: Yep It's published by Rio Grande games in the US and some other and Ravens burger and abacus elsewhere I guess and the game is to call T ik al also known as tickle by us.

380
00:28:19,672 --> 00:28:21,980
Speaker 0: Now Tikal is part of this trilogy.

381
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,184
Speaker 0: I think was called the mass job.

382
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:23,746
Speaker 0: It says right here.

383
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:24,790
Speaker 0: It's called the mass trilogy.

384
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:34,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are two other games that are very very similar to Tikal made by the same other Thematically similar other similar and ways than that.

385
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,986
Speaker 1: Yes, and they have the action point system.

386
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:37,748
Speaker 0: Yes, hence.

387
00:28:37,768 --> 00:28:38,690
Speaker 0: They're very similar.

388
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:48,010
Speaker 0: They share a great many game mechanics Tikal and the other two games are Java which we've played and I think I'm the only person in our crew who likes that game.

389
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:49,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, I only played it.

390
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:50,421
Speaker 1: I don't know how.

391
00:28:50,602 --> 00:28:58,250
Speaker 1: if I played both Java and Maya I know I've played at least one of them and I only played the other than one of them that I have played once.

392
00:28:58,651 --> 00:28:59,594
Speaker 1: So I barely remember.

393
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,216
Speaker 0: it's not Maya.

394
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:00,818
Speaker 0: It's Mexico.

395
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:02,804
Speaker 0: Okay, Kyle Java, Mexico.

396
00:29:02,945 --> 00:29:03,286
Speaker 0: Okay.

397
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:04,650
Speaker 0: We I've never played, Mexico?

398
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:08,242
Speaker 1: Okay, so then Java is the one I have played and I only played it once.

399
00:29:08,423 --> 00:29:18,134
Speaker 0: job is the one where basically all three of these games the main thing they have in common other than theme and cover art and General game mechanics.

400
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:23,691
Speaker 0: The main thing is that all of these games have this system where they'll give you a number of action points on Your turn.

401
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:30,254
Speaker 0: so say you get ten action points and there are a number of actions you can take and each action takes a number Of action points.

402
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:38,830
Speaker 1: you have this little card in front of you and the card will say You know putting a guy on the board cost one point moving a guy cost one point building a house cost three points.

403
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:43,730
Speaker 1: So on your turn you let's say you could ever if I if what I just said is true.

404
00:29:44,091 --> 00:29:46,560
Speaker 1: You could build three houses and put a guy on the board.

405
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,242
Speaker 1: That's ten points.

406
00:29:47,262 --> 00:29:49,490
Speaker 0: You're done or you could put ten guys on the board.

407
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:58,167
Speaker 1: Yep It's up to you to use your ten victory or action points in any way you want According to the prices laid out on the card and the prices later to the car.

408
00:29:58,187 --> 00:29:58,730
Speaker 1: don't change.

409
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:00,981
Speaker 1: It's just that's what it costs to do things.

410
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:02,589
Speaker 0: It's a very elegant system.

411
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:11,643
Speaker 0: However in Java in particular after playing the game three or four times I figured out exactly how they determine the number of action points to give you.

412
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,750
Speaker 0: well, yeah, so it's a German game.

413
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:21,450
Speaker 0: So obviously what they did is they went to a German pub because actually in Germany From what we have heard tell a lot of people play these games just recreationally all the time.

414
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,638
Speaker 1: Well, that's what we hear.

415
00:30:22,678 --> 00:30:24,350
Speaker 1: I don't know how much true it is, but that's what I hear.

416
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,140
Speaker 0: Well, hence I said that's what we hear tell.

417
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:27,770
Speaker 0: Yep, but they went to a pub.

418
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:36,850
Speaker 0: They found a bunch of Germans who were sitting around and they put this game in front of them and they gave them 20 action Points and said play the game and the game progressed normally.

419
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:46,561
Speaker 0: then they told them they gave them all a round of beers and they gave them 19 action points instead per turn and they played Again, and every time they gave him a round of beer and they took away an action point.

420
00:30:46,882 --> 00:30:53,869
Speaker 0: the moment the exact moment a fistfight Broke out they knew exactly how many goddamn action points to put in that game.

421
00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:09,162
Speaker 0: Goddamnit did Java just you never had enough points and the game just hurt constantly and Your option was basically screw another player Horribly and totally or do something totally ineffectual and get like one point.

422
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:15,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it's basically was beautiful The way everything works out and the way everything costs in order to do anything.

423
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,710
Speaker 1: It's like it'll get to your turn right and you'd be like, alright, it's my turn.

424
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:21,789
Speaker 1: I can get a bunch of points if I do that thing over there.

425
00:31:22,336 --> 00:31:23,249
Speaker 1: How many you know?

426
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:28,830
Speaker 1: How can I use these 10 action points in order to achieve that thing that will get me a bunch of victory points?

427
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,322
Speaker 1: And so I can so I can win the game in Java.

428
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:41,665
Speaker 0: You're always one short So you always got a plan two turns ahead, but the moment you think you're planned ahead Someone else who's playing just puts one of those tiles right in your way and it's all over.

429
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:42,126
Speaker 0: Yep.

430
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:47,610
Speaker 1: It's like, alright I'll do this and this and this and this and this and I. there's no way I can do it.

431
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:48,762
Speaker 1: I don't have enough points.

432
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:56,229
Speaker 1: Good God I guess I'll just use these points to fuck someone else because subtracting five from them is almost as good as adding five to me.

433
00:31:56,972 --> 00:32:00,910
Speaker 0: Now luckily to call does not have that problem even though I don't think it's a problem.

434
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,297
Speaker 0: I think you guys are all just wusses.

435
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:03,000
Speaker 0: I love Java.

436
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:03,885
Speaker 0: I think it's a great game.

437
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:04,990
Speaker 1: I only played it once.

438
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:05,978
Speaker 1: I barely remember it.

439
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:07,229
Speaker 0: Well Tikal is.

440
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:19,130
Speaker 0: the basic idea of Tikal is that you are some sort of archaeologist and you lead an archaeologist team and You are going through various jungles digging up temples and digging up treasures.

441
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:30,154
Speaker 0: Yep Meanwhile, there are a bunch of other archaeologists with their own teams And they're also going around digging up temples and digging up treasures and you want to dig up more temples and treasures than they do And better ones.

442
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:35,270
Speaker 1: that way you are the famous explorer and Archaeologist and they are the loser.

443
00:32:35,612 --> 00:32:38,809
Speaker 0: So the way the game progresses every round you draw a tile you look at it.

444
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:40,548
Speaker 0: The tile might have some stuff on it.

445
00:32:40,891 --> 00:32:42,335
Speaker 0: You place the tile on the board.

446
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:44,642
Speaker 0: then you spend ten action points.

447
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:52,003
Speaker 0: doing things and things include putting Archaeologists on the board putting your one really fat archaeologist on the board.

448
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,470
Speaker 1: He's like a triple archaeologist superpower.

449
00:32:54,912 --> 00:32:55,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's gigantic.

450
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:58,370
Speaker 0: he must be one of those Nazis in an Indiana Jones movie.

451
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,055
Speaker 1: He must be.

452
00:32:59,135 --> 00:33:01,050
Speaker 1: I don't know what he is, but he's really powerful.

453
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:03,636
Speaker 0: Or like you can move guys around.

454
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:08,450
Speaker 0: you can excavate a temple which makes it more valuable by digging up more of it.

455
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,900
Speaker 0: And oh, it's bigger than we thought.

456
00:33:10,182 --> 00:33:11,290
Speaker 0: you can dig up some treasure.

457
00:33:11,752 --> 00:33:15,630
Speaker 0: You can seal someone else's treasure and leave some crap treasure in their space instead.

458
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:16,652
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz like.

459
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:21,850
Speaker 1: the way the treasures work is pretty simple is each does so many treasures in the game and there's three of each kind.

460
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:26,349
Speaker 1: So when you get a treasure you want to get a bunch of the same treasure like let's say I get.

461
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:35,785
Speaker 0: well The reason is whenever you score one treasure is worth one point one set of two is Worth three points and a set of three is worth six points.

462
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:36,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely want set.

463
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,041
Speaker 1: So let's say I dig up the elephant mask.

464
00:33:39,181 --> 00:33:40,810
Speaker 1: I want to get more elephant masks.

465
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:43,350
Speaker 1: I don't want to get like some gold jewels or anything.

466
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,920
Speaker 1: I want to get elephant masks because I've already got one.

467
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:53,589
Speaker 0: now the other interesting mechanic there is that yeah You can spend action points to swap treasures with people but you can never break up a set of any number.

468
00:33:54,211 --> 00:34:01,430
Speaker 0: So the game and also due to the nature of the game, you know that before the end every single treasure will come up.

469
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:05,937
Speaker 1: Well, they might not all get dug up before the end of the game But they probably will.

470
00:34:06,098 --> 00:34:08,690
Speaker 0: every single treasure will be available in the game.

471
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:10,898
Speaker 0: It will be there and you could get it if you wanted it.

472
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,789
Speaker 1: if you really really really wanted it you could get it.

473
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:18,489
Speaker 1: It's possible that someone might just make it very difficult to get and there's no reason to go for it.

474
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,127
Speaker 0: See the way the game progresses though that all.

475
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:30,230
Speaker 0: in fact I would say that no competent player Would ignore a treasure that was out by itself like that and I can't see any situation where people would ignore a treasure.

476
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:35,532
Speaker 1: Well, someone could line it up in such a way that you'd have to move a guy over so much territory But there

477
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:43,223
Speaker 0: are always multiple ways to get something and if they spent all their time doing something like that They lost the game for themselves already because they're not a competent player.

478
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:43,603
Speaker 1: Yep.

479
00:34:43,784 --> 00:34:44,167
Speaker 1: Yeah.

480
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:45,070
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

481
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,489
Speaker 1: It could just be a weird map that one time.

482
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:55,130
Speaker 0: So, you know I think the way the game progresses in the way the types of tiles are No player who has the chance of winning the game could do that.

483
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,409
Speaker 1: I don't know.

484
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:02,450
Speaker 0: There is no way to do that and win the game if everyone is equally confident because that you've already wasted a tile placement.

485
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:03,575
Speaker 1: Oh, it's true.

486
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:03,997
Speaker 1: It's true.

487
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:07,110
Speaker 0: So it won't come up ever unless you're playing with people who suck at the game.

488
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,264
Speaker 0: But anyway, so you draw a tile.

489
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:10,210
Speaker 0: it might have stuff on it.

490
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:16,828
Speaker 0: You place it you take your ten actions and you're done and then everyone goes around draw a tile play a tile take ten action points.

491
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,516
Speaker 0: Eventually someone draws a volcano.

492
00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:20,399
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

493
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:23,127
Speaker 1: It's a volcano and not a temple of something.

494
00:35:23,227 --> 00:35:23,969
Speaker 1: We're not trouble.

495
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:26,057
Speaker 0: now Here's the fun mechanic of scoring.

496
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:33,842
Speaker 0: when you score the volcanoes drawn you all go around Everyone takes ten action points and then scores one at a time.

497
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:35,688
Speaker 0: and the way you score is really simply.

498
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:42,613
Speaker 0: you count up your treasures And then for every temple that's excavated look to see who has the most Archaeologists there.

499
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:45,201
Speaker 0: whoever has the most gets the points.

500
00:35:45,401 --> 00:35:48,430
Speaker 0: if you're tied nobody gets any points, right?

501
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:53,655
Speaker 1: So let's say there's a temple there and the temple is a five-point temple and I have four Archaeologists there.

502
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:55,462
Speaker 1: rim draws the volcano.

503
00:35:55,924 --> 00:36:03,549
Speaker 1: He moves five Archaeologists there now and then he's done and he scores his five points for that temple.

504
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:05,710
Speaker 0: Yep So now it's Scott's turn to score.

505
00:36:06,055 --> 00:36:11,990
Speaker 1: I move two more Archaeologists there to get six which is greater than rims five and I score the points for that temple.

506
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:14,518
Speaker 0: So now we both got the same number of points.

507
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:24,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time rim might go ha ha ha I'll move so many guys there and now you had all those guys already sitting there expecting to get five points.

508
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:27,224
Speaker 1: But now all those guys that you spend action points are useless.

509
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:28,590
Speaker 1: They're not getting you anything.

510
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:42,178
Speaker 0: It's not quite the traditional system of have the most guys everywhere get the points whatever because you score one by one and getting points for yourself does not Necessarily preclude anyone else from also getting those points.

511
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:55,690
Speaker 0: And in fact it if you're playing the game mathematically each guy you put there Decreases the percentage chance that another player will be able to get those points or in the very least Increases the opportunity cost of getting those points.

512
00:36:56,011 --> 00:37:05,160
Speaker 0: So you have to play a lot of percentage statistics games and you have to do a lot of calculations to figure out For each guy I put there how many points on average.

513
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:10,136
Speaker 0: am I denying the person by forcing them to put another guy there To get the same number of points.

514
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:12,347
Speaker 0: It's not nearly as straight up as other games are.

515
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:18,690
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like alright if that guy wants to get all he could get all these points right now with his ten action points.

516
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:22,344
Speaker 1: So if I do this, alright now I'm denying him those points.

517
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:32,129
Speaker 1: or if he chooses to get these points He's denying himself all those other points over there and you just kind of have to maneuver your guys in such a way that not Only do you get as many points as you can?

518
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:41,906
Speaker 1: But you make it as hard as possible for other people to just get a whole bunch of points and you make it as Expensive as possible for them to get some more now at its core.

519
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:42,670
Speaker 0: That's it.

520
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:43,734
Speaker 0: that's the whole game.

521
00:37:43,754 --> 00:37:45,722
Speaker 0: when you get to the end you do a final scoring round.

522
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:50,750
Speaker 0: whoever has the most points wins and There are a lot of really interesting ideas here.

523
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,414
Speaker 0: I mean what I said.

524
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,603
Speaker 0: you can excavate temples.

525
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:58,467
Speaker 0: that makes them more valuable For when you have guys on temples you can spend the time and action points to dig them up.

526
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,536
Speaker 0: and every time you dig them Up, they're worth one more point.

527
00:38:00,636 --> 00:38:03,390
Speaker 1: So let's say I'm sitting as a temple and the temples worth three points.

528
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,030
Speaker 1: It says three on it right and I got a guy sitting there.

529
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,064
Speaker 1: So I tell the guy hey guy dig and the temple becomes worth four points.

530
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:10,967
Speaker 1: Hurray.

531
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:13,870
Speaker 0: All right, great You think all right, why don't you just dig up every temple you've got?

532
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:18,525
Speaker 0: Well doesn't mean someone else could just take your temple from you by having more guys there.

533
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:29,050
Speaker 0: Yeah digging up a temple Spending your resources your action points to dig up that temple does not fruit does not in the end Guarantee that you will get any of those points.

534
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:33,329
Speaker 0: You might dig up temples and never ever get the points for them if everyone else just keeps jumping in.

535
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:38,068
Speaker 1: Yep so I have a guy in a temple I dig it up and I dig it up and now it's worth six points.

536
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:41,181
Speaker 1: and then Ray moves a bunch of guys over there and takes the six points from me.

537
00:38:41,463 --> 00:38:44,133
Speaker 1: and now I can't move enough guys in to get The six points back.

538
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:47,526
Speaker 1: I basically just gave rim a whole pile of action points.

539
00:38:48,008 --> 00:38:50,660
Speaker 1: Yeah That hurts real bad.

540
00:38:50,982 --> 00:38:52,250
Speaker 0: So the game comes down.

541
00:38:52,270 --> 00:39:14,790
Speaker 0: There's a lot of not so much risk management But definitely you have to look at opportunity costs and calculate opportunity costs of every possible action as quickly as possible in Order to determine how worth it it is to defend something or more importantly how worth it It is to expend your precious limited resources to improve something that may not be yours in the future.

542
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:23,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing in this game is you have to notice opportunities on the board like oh There's a way I can get all those points over there.

543
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:29,607
Speaker 1: if I do this if I spend my action points in this clever way You know building a tent or something like that.

544
00:39:29,627 --> 00:39:40,230
Speaker 0: Aha I pulled a really clever one because we played the game not too long ago so we could review it and It's a trick that I thought about but I never had the opportunity to do and it worked out so well.

545
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:44,189
Speaker 0: Alex had a really valuable temple and he had a few guys defending it.

546
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:48,610
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I think he had two guys there, but there was no one anywhere near it at all.

547
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:51,081
Speaker 0: So he didn't have to worry and it was worth a lot of points.

548
00:39:51,744 --> 00:40:04,546
Speaker 0: a scoring round came up And there's one thing you can do in the game where you can only do this twice and there's a high heavy heavy Cost for doing it and not only does it cost a lot of action points But it also costs you physical guys.

549
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:08,721
Speaker 0: you lose Archaeologists permanently, but basically the mechanic comes down to.

550
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:18,920
Speaker 0: if you are winning a temple you can Sacrifice all your guys there to basically put an archaeologist with the machine gun on top of it And now it is yours no matter what forever.

551
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, so let's say there's a temple sitting there.

552
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,679
Speaker 1: It's worth like eight points.

553
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,249
Speaker 1: So I I don't want to let anyone have it.

554
00:40:24,531 --> 00:40:27,570
Speaker 1: I don't want anyone to get those eight points, but me and I dug up most of it.

555
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:33,077
Speaker 1: So there's no way I'm letting anyone else get those points and I've got like five Archaeologists there and rims got two.

556
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:44,050
Speaker 1: so I say alright screw this and I kill those five Archaeologists and so I can't use them anymore in the game Which is pretty rough because you only have a limited number of the guys available to you in the game

557
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:47,108
Speaker 0: And if you're not using all of them at all times you're probably losing.

558
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:52,910
Speaker 1: well You have to spend the first part of the game getting them all onto the board But once they're all on the board you use them all at all times.

559
00:40:52,910 --> 00:41:01,770
Speaker 0: Yeah But you got to be careful because if you put too many out too quickly You very much hamper yourself in terms of taking future actions because now you're limited in your sphere of influence.

560
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:07,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also if you put not enough out early enough You're not gonna get enough guys on the board to take control of anything.

561
00:41:08,206 --> 00:41:13,470
Speaker 0: I actually have Exact numbers of guys I put out in different rounds of the game that I play.

562
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:24,837
Speaker 0: I play the same way every time yeah, and I win a lot of the time But I partly that's cuz I played this game more than everyone else because I bought it way back and I played it with this Whole other group of people a bunch of times.

563
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:31,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't wonder him getting those points and I say alright I kill all these five archaeologists and they go away and I'm fucked.

564
00:41:32,252 --> 00:41:37,246
Speaker 1: But now those are my eight points in every scoring round from now until the end of the game.

565
00:41:37,307 --> 00:41:37,888
Speaker 1: no matter what.

566
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:40,718
Speaker 1: I don't have It I can concentrate elsewhere.

567
00:41:40,738 --> 00:41:41,661
Speaker 0: now think about it.

568
00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:42,925
Speaker 0: It's not just now.

569
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:44,350
Speaker 0: this temple is super well defended.

570
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:46,155
Speaker 0: It's no matter what.

571
00:41:46,476 --> 00:41:50,508
Speaker 0: no one else can ever get these points nor can they ever take these points away from you.

572
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:59,720
Speaker 1: It's huge Yep, however, there is a quite a disadvantage that is not so obvious that okay Let's say I got five guys there rims got three right rims.

573
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,528
Speaker 1: three guys right now are sorta.

574
00:42:02,568 --> 00:42:03,390
Speaker 1: they're not gonna move.

575
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:16,205
Speaker 1: They're gonna stay there to fight You know to get these points and I you know if I can hold rims guys there and they're not really useful because he doesn't Want to make him leave to go do something else, but he's not.

576
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:17,650
Speaker 1: they're not doing anything sitting there.

577
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,901
Speaker 1: So I'm sort of keeping rims guys hostage.

578
00:42:20,202 --> 00:42:27,190
Speaker 1: by sacrificing my guys I'm losing five guys, which is a lot worse than rim effectively losing three guys.

579
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:36,129
Speaker 1: But now by putting the machine gun guy on top of the temple rims three guys are free and they can go do something else Because they're no longer a use for him there.

580
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:37,013
Speaker 1: They're doing now.

581
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:41,150
Speaker 1: he knows that there's no reason to keep him there and he can go run away and grab something else.

582
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:42,403
Speaker 1: It's might be worth more points.

583
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:47,070
Speaker 0: So Alex had a temple that was moderately defended and is worth a lot of points.

584
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:55,706
Speaker 0: There was no one really near it But I had calculated and I had kept my three guy my one Archaeologist who's worth three points and it was near the end of the game the fat guy.

585
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:56,610
Speaker 0: Yep the fat guy.

586
00:42:57,172 --> 00:42:59,846
Speaker 0: So I had exactly enough points to where.

587
00:42:59,906 --> 00:43:12,248
Speaker 0: when it was time Right during a scoring round because I happen to be scoring before him and he was counting on those points I spent all of my action points to move my three guy over to that temple and then cap it.

588
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,945
Speaker 0: Oh He he was so pissed.

589
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:16,710
Speaker 0: It was beautiful.

590
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing with the three guy is there's quite a bit of strategy surrounding the three guy.

591
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:25,347
Speaker 1: It's all your archaeologists are worth one and they cost the same to move.

592
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:30,027
Speaker 1: and they're Basically, if you're looking to see who has the most in an area you count them as one.

593
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:38,360
Speaker 0: Yep so say then now look say you've got four guys and you want to move into the next tile and say it cost two action Points to move across that barrier to the next tile.

594
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:45,789
Speaker 1: moving those four guys across cost you eight points Yep, but the three guy is a single guy who's worth three.

595
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:52,708
Speaker 1: So if I've got this guy next to a temple and you've got two guys next to the same temple I win because he's worth three.

596
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:58,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, but to move him around you move him around as if he's only one guy because he's only one guy.

597
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:04,852
Speaker 1: So if it would normally take two action points to move a guy from one tile to the next Right.

598
00:44:04,932 --> 00:44:12,607
Speaker 1: This guy takes two to move from one tile to the next but to take three guys across the same barrier would cause six points.

599
00:44:13,396 --> 00:44:18,102
Speaker 0: So he's really useful now in terms of more advanced strategy.

600
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:24,290
Speaker 0: the real uses of this guy are Mostly to go gather treasure because he can move quickly and he counts as multiple guys.

601
00:44:24,632 --> 00:44:27,690
Speaker 0: He can dig up a bunch of treasure really quick really easily no matter where it's hidden.

602
00:44:27,971 --> 00:44:36,339
Speaker 1: yep, because normally you need one guy on a tile can dig up one treasure per turn and you can dig up to top two Treasures per tile per turn maximum.

603
00:44:36,821 --> 00:44:48,210
Speaker 1: So if you're gonna go get a treasure you can move this guy over there and it costs a lot less to have him move to the treasure tile and Then he can dig up two treasures all on his own because he's worth three guys.

604
00:44:48,952 --> 00:45:01,750
Speaker 0: Now the only other real use is if you put him in a temple dense area and if especially if it's an area That's contended between you and other players You can use him to leverage around and to guarantee that you'll score something over there.

605
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,739
Speaker 0: It's kind of like a heavy hitter.

606
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:24,932
Speaker 0: other than that A lot of players like to use them a lot early on and move them around a lot and waste action points when they could Have done things more efficiently and also a lot of people They make the mistake of thinking he's more valuable than he is and you really shouldn't be above Suddenly using him in a blitz to capture a temple with a guard and lose him from the game to suddenly take the upper hand Somewhere.

607
00:45:25,073 --> 00:45:33,237
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially if it's like in right before the second scoring round That's probably a good time because then you get a whole bunch of points for it But you still used him to dig up some treasure before.

608
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:42,099
Speaker 0: well, it also doesn't help that on many playings of this game I've discovered that in general There's the only two ways to score are the temples and the treasure.

609
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:48,056
Speaker 0: the treasure is mostly useless and you can very much win Mostly ignoring the treasure.

610
00:45:48,256 --> 00:45:49,059
Speaker 1: you can't ignore.

611
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,506
Speaker 1: we can't completely ignore the treasure.

612
00:45:51,787 --> 00:45:52,630
Speaker 1: You won't win that way.

613
00:45:52,730 --> 00:46:00,290
Speaker 0: However, it's trivial to gather at least one set which will keep you in the game with almost no effort and no research research expenditure.

614
00:46:00,806 --> 00:46:17,576
Speaker 1: Yeah It does seem like if you actually try to get a whole lot of treasure You end up having to spend a lot of action points unless you're just so lucky that you're the one who always draws the treasure Tiles in which case it's just luck And you end up getting a lot of points for it But not enough to actually win.

615
00:46:18,118 --> 00:46:25,548
Speaker 1: and if you spend all those action points getting all those treasures You're not gonna have enough action points to get any temples and you're not gonna win that way.

616
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:36,705
Speaker 0: Now not to get into a lot of detail about the core down mechanics We could talk forever about the relative value of treasures, but the truth is playing this game multiple times.

617
00:46:37,106 --> 00:46:53,371
Speaker 0: There is one primary Fairly obvious path to victory and once you see one person use this method the all the game really comes down to is Placing tiles in such a way that you can cordon off an area of the board where it's very difficult for other players to get To.

618
00:46:53,792 --> 00:47:09,410
Speaker 0: yet you can easily move guys in or have guys there and then you proceed to with very few guys Control a great number of temples dig them up as fast as possible and leave one or two guys on each getting a whole ton Of points, I've never seen a good player win any other way consistently.

619
00:47:09,892 --> 00:47:16,335
Speaker 1: Yep, the thing is if everyone's a good player, they'll recognize when you're trying to do this they'll look at the board and they'll say

620
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:16,676
Speaker 0: aha

621
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:24,586
Speaker 1: so and so is going to be able to do this in that area over there and Then with the tiles that they draw hopefully they'll be able to stop you.

622
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:30,166
Speaker 0: now You see this is the one kind of problem with the game early on and they recognized it.

623
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,130
Speaker 0: that all right.

624
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:35,310
Speaker 0: So everyone's good and they realize that tile placement matters more than anything.

625
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:39,549
Speaker 0: Placing tiles in ways to get more points is the best way to win.

626
00:47:40,771 --> 00:47:48,756
Speaker 0: So now the most important thing on your turn is what tile you drew, but the tiles are drawn Randomly, well, they're drawn semi randomly.

627
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:52,567
Speaker 1: the tiles have letters on the back ABCD in terms of what you draw.

628
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:53,470
Speaker 0: They're random.

629
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:59,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only non random factor is the progression of the game in terms of what kinds of tiles can come up.

630
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:08,732
Speaker 1: Yep early in the game, you'll always get tiles that are easy to move between and Generally the temples on them aren't worth so many but the treasures on them They'll get.

631
00:48:08,893 --> 00:48:11,610
Speaker 1: you'll get tiles with a whole lot of treasures late in the game.

632
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:14,904
Speaker 1: You'll get temples that are worth a lot of points and you'll get.

633
00:48:15,346 --> 00:48:18,320
Speaker 1: if you get a treasure tile It'll probably only have two treasures on it.

634
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,963
Speaker 1: Maybe three.

635
00:48:19,365 --> 00:48:23,342
Speaker 0: but when I say random I mean that the tile you draw you have no control over that.

636
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:25,229
Speaker 0: you're stuck with it and the luck of the draw.

637
00:48:25,249 --> 00:48:27,660
Speaker 0: you might Never draw a treasure tile never get to place one.

638
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:35,519
Speaker 0: You might always get temples that are useless You might always get open land and as a result Advanced players could easily make a valid point.

639
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,750
Speaker 0: that I only lost because I draw crap tiles and sometimes that's true.

640
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:48,750
Speaker 1: Most of the time it's not because things tend to even out but it's still at least once I've lost simply because I just kept drawing tiles that weren't worth anything.

641
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:50,396
Speaker 1: So there was nothing I could do with them.

642
00:48:50,476 --> 00:48:52,985
Speaker 0: in the trend of a lot of older German style games.

643
00:48:53,507 --> 00:48:57,030
Speaker 0: There is included Alternate rules and the alternate rules.

644
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:05,381
Speaker 0: It's the exact same game for the most part except that now instead of playing the game with a random tile drawing everyone starts with a number of victory points.

645
00:49:05,883 --> 00:49:15,277
Speaker 0: you then in a Incredibly clue G mechanic that I really don't like but that might just be a factor of the times bid Victory points.

646
00:49:15,518 --> 00:49:22,490
Speaker 0: you bid straight up the victory points You need to win because whoever has the most at the end wins for who gets to pick the tile first.

647
00:49:22,952 --> 00:49:23,738
Speaker 1: Yes, you'll draw.

648
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,470
Speaker 1: let's say there's four players, right?

649
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:30,364
Speaker 1: You'll draw four tiles from the stack and you'll say alright who wants to?

650
00:49:30,705 --> 00:49:39,310
Speaker 1: you know, whoever bids first will say You know how many victory points they're willing to spend to pick a tile first and then someone else will say how many victory points?

651
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:51,970
Speaker 1: They're willing to spend to pick a tile first and you go around and around and around and whoever is willing to spend more Victory points will be able to draw tiles before the other people do and you can see all the tiles that are available.

652
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:57,425
Speaker 1: So you're not gonna be like, you know bidding to get some mystery tile you're bidding for.

653
00:49:57,606 --> 00:49:59,090
Speaker 1: Oh, I definitely treasure there.

654
00:49:59,271 --> 00:50:00,718
Speaker 1: I want that treasure real bad.

655
00:50:00,778 --> 00:50:03,070
Speaker 1: I'll spend three victory points to get that treasure tile.

656
00:50:03,451 --> 00:50:09,007
Speaker 0: Now the problem is going into this alternate rule set and we all fell for this.

657
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,378
Speaker 0: We thought alright There's gonna be a lot of bidding.

658
00:50:11,418 --> 00:50:12,463
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a bidding game.

659
00:50:12,524 --> 00:50:12,685
Speaker 0: Now.

660
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:13,569
Speaker 0: This is gonna be great.

661
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,829
Speaker 0: Actually, the bidding is really not fun.

662
00:50:17,532 --> 00:50:27,162
Speaker 0: It generally tends to fall into the cyclical pattern of one person will keep going first or one person will keep going last or Scott'll keep over bidding for treasure tiles.

663
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:28,387
Speaker 1: I only did that once.

664
00:50:28,407 --> 00:50:31,681
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, you did it enough in the early part of the game to lose.

665
00:50:31,882 --> 00:50:39,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did it once in the early game I spent way too much for this one treasure tile and then I realized I couldn't do what I wanted to do with it.

666
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:47,024
Speaker 0: what really sucked was that at the end we counted the difference in points and It really might have made the difference if Scott hadn't bid that much.

667
00:50:47,064 --> 00:50:48,390
Speaker 0: if I would have won I might have won.

668
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,410
Speaker 1: Yes, it but it was not a good move.

669
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,530
Speaker 0: The truth is that the bidding mechanic isn't meant to be used as a bidding mechanic.

670
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:58,150
Speaker 0: You know, you shouldn't just be bidding like I'll bid one two, three four and all that fun stuff.

671
00:50:58,571 --> 00:51:10,465
Speaker 0: All it is is that generally if there's a great disparity in the value of the tiles that come up There will be a quick Correction where the tile that is worth the most will cost the person who gets it a little bit.

672
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,010
Speaker 0: thus evening out the randomness.

673
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:19,545
Speaker 1: It's basically a hack to make the game a little less random That I would have a lot less problem with it if it was more fun.

674
00:51:19,605 --> 00:51:22,300
Speaker 1: that way it's like, okay We've made the game less random.

675
00:51:22,502 --> 00:51:23,730
Speaker 0: We've also made it less fun.

676
00:51:23,857 --> 00:51:24,392
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like.

677
00:51:24,412 --> 00:51:32,710
Speaker 1: and now the game is sort of fair and you can't complain that you only Lost because you didn't get the tiles you wanted because you could have gotten the tiles you wanted.

678
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:37,890
Speaker 1: However, now the game is not interesting as it was because there's no more.

679
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:49,105
Speaker 1: I think a lot of the game is the excitement of here because the first thing you do on your turn and the most important thing you do is draw a new tile show it to Everyone and put it on the board and that's always like what tile is it?

680
00:51:49,366 --> 00:51:50,310
Speaker 1: Whoa volcano?

681
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:55,390
Speaker 0: And usually about three quarters of way through the game and this happens every single time I've ever played.

682
00:51:55,531 --> 00:51:58,329
Speaker 0: Yeah players will start because it can affect the game.

683
00:51:58,691 --> 00:52:06,088
Speaker 0: So during Scott's turn Alex and I both draw our tiles and look at him and go haha You're not gonna believe what's coming up.

684
00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:08,598
Speaker 1: You're really not supposed to do that.

685
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:09,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

686
00:52:09,682 --> 00:52:11,830
Speaker 0: It only would matter if we were timing our turn.

687
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does matter for you.

688
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:15,410
Speaker 1: you get time to think about where you're gonna place it.

689
00:52:15,611 --> 00:52:19,050
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter because the other problem with this game is that for a good player?

690
00:52:19,591 --> 00:52:22,130
Speaker 0: It's so painfully obvious where you should put things.

691
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:30,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like this board for Tikal has a whole lot of spaces on it So and there's not too many places that you can legally place your tile.

692
00:52:30,404 --> 00:52:34,330
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Yeah, it's not a difficult decision.

693
00:52:34,912 --> 00:52:43,516
Speaker 0: I guess the end sum of all this is that Tikal is a fun game the first few times you play it and is otherwise Generally, not a great game.

694
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,183
Speaker 1: Oh, I think it's a definitely a good game.

695
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:58,010
Speaker 1: It is worth playing many times Yes, but in the long run, you're probably just gonna be like to call maybe play it once every few months or so Every year part of us that we played it.

696
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:10,230
Speaker 0: I played it 15 or 20 times over the course of several months and then it was it wasn't really solved and that someone could Always win but it was solved and that everyone knew exactly how the game was gonna progress and it wasn't fun anymore.

697
00:53:10,692 --> 00:53:15,910
Speaker 0: So I put it away and just recently we pulled it out again partly because we're desperate for new goddamn games to play.

698
00:53:16,211 --> 00:53:19,804
Speaker 0: We've been playing the games we have constantly and Tikal was hidden upstairs.

699
00:53:19,885 --> 00:53:20,929
Speaker 0: We kept forgetting I owned it.

700
00:53:21,129 --> 00:53:26,913
Speaker 1: Yep Well, if you want to play to call you can go and buy it which shouldn't be too difficult Isn't it?

701
00:53:27,054 --> 00:53:28,196
Speaker 1: yep, that's what I was about to say.

702
00:53:28,216 --> 00:53:41,978
Speaker 1: if you go to spiel by web.com s p i e l b y w e b dot com It's this fun website that lets you play a certain set of German board games for free Against other people on the internet.

703
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:55,399
Speaker 1: the way it works generally is you go to this website It shows you the game you take your turn and then it emails you when it's your turn again and you go back to the website and you take your turn and then an Emails you when it's your turn again, and that's all you do.

704
00:53:55,821 --> 00:53:59,755
Speaker 1: and to call is one of the games that they have available there And it's free.

705
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:09,150
Speaker 1: So if you've never played to call you can go there and read the rules and And you can play a game for fun and you will see if you like this before you spend any money on it.

706
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:13,830
Speaker 0: But in general, I wouldn't recommend if you see it buying the whole mass trilogy.

707
00:54:14,312 --> 00:54:17,225
Speaker 0: I would definitely recommend Java ahead of Tikal.

708
00:54:17,346 --> 00:54:22,026
Speaker 1: I like Java a lot Can't say because I only played Java once so I don't.

709
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:23,171
Speaker 1: I don't remember it I don't know.

710
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:27,844
Speaker 0: just I feel like the game play of Java is more interesting.

711
00:54:27,924 --> 00:54:38,913
Speaker 0: while you're playing to call falls into this lull slash rut about Just over halfway through the game where you stop caring because you already know who's winning and you already know They're winning by a lot.

712
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:49,370
Speaker 0: and yet you generally start to feel how the game is gonna progress and while someone could catch up You still you'll feel that coming the game doesn't surprise you a lot the game doesn't stay interesting.

713
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:54,750
Speaker 0: I really feel like I just want to go play with my mudkips instead of playing to call about halfway through.

714
00:54:55,173 --> 00:54:57,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, I definitely see that about halfway through.

715
00:54:58,332 --> 00:55:10,816
Speaker 1: The worst is when you're not winning because then it feels really terrible because like you you'll generally Spend a bunch of action points and if you're losing you'll spend a bunch of action points And then someone else will be like, haha That was a waste of action points.

716
00:55:10,877 --> 00:55:34,220
Speaker 1: watch this and then suddenly all those action points You just spent will be wasted because you'll like dig up a temple and someone will take you from you or you'll move a bunch of guys into a temple and then someone else will put the machine gun guy on top and you're like Ah, I just lost all those action points that I just spent and it feels like ass and it basically at that point You've lost and you don't really want to play anymore.

717
00:55:34,421 --> 00:55:47,339
Speaker 0: The other problem is all those fun tactics We were talking about like oh I jumped in on your guy or oh you didn't count but I had enough guys over there even though it didn't look like it to suddenly take that temple from you or Scoring around.

718
00:55:47,379 --> 00:55:48,450
Speaker 0: look where I put the volcano.

719
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:53,470
Speaker 0: Because after you've played the game a bunch of times those stress there is no trick.

720
00:55:53,872 --> 00:55:58,010
Speaker 0: That is not obvious if you take the time to actually look at the board before you take your turn.

721
00:55:58,411 --> 00:56:05,599
Speaker 0: There is no way you could ever be caught off guard by a trick unless you weren't paying attention Or you hadn't played the game a lot before.

722
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,850
Speaker 0: so that aspect of the game disappears pretty quick And then you're left with a generally boring game.

723
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:21,471
Speaker 1: Yeah in the recent times we've played I was only surprised once when Alex put down the empty tile and then immediately put the tent on it and unloaded a whole bunch of guys right into that big Temple.

724
00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:22,375
Speaker 1: remember that.

725
00:56:22,736 --> 00:56:25,767
Speaker 0: I remember that I was expecting it, but it wasn't gonna hurt me.

726
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:26,450
Speaker 0: So I didn't care.

727
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,157
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just didn't see that coming.

728
00:56:28,197 --> 00:56:31,792
Speaker 1: Like that wasn't even an option for like in my brain and then now it is Yeah,

729
00:56:31,832 --> 00:56:41,802
Speaker 0: well part of it is that like the way the game is there are options that on a logical level Especially for a novice player and even for experienced players just the way the game is set up.

730
00:56:42,283 --> 00:56:54,681
Speaker 0: You'll know intellectually that yes Theoretically Scott could by spending X action points put this here and take that temple from me But you don't think they'll actually do it.

731
00:56:55,043 --> 00:56:55,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

732
00:56:56,066 --> 00:56:57,150
Speaker 0: why would he actually do that?

733
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:00,830
Speaker 0: He won't do that, but then he does it because it's actually the best thing to do and you were just stupid.

734
00:57:01,011 --> 00:57:05,444
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like cuz it seems the way the action points work like to build a tent which can.

735
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,270
Speaker 1: it's a basically a guy factory.

736
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:10,061
Speaker 1: It costs five five action points.

737
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:11,989
Speaker 1: That's half your turn to build a tent, right?

738
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:17,445
Speaker 1: But the tent allows you to make guys pretty much on a brand new tile.

739
00:57:17,746 --> 00:57:19,190
Speaker 1: That's crazy powerful.

740
00:57:19,391 --> 00:57:30,170
Speaker 1: So people will spend those five action points build the tent in a crazy way and do something crazy dangerous That you wouldn't see coming because you don't expect someone to spend five action points.

741
00:57:30,452 --> 00:57:38,301
Speaker 0: Like you feel as though spending five is way too expensive But then you realize that no it's worth exactly five.

742
00:57:38,361 --> 00:57:41,690
Speaker 0: you get five action points worth of value from doing it.

743
00:57:42,111 --> 00:57:43,540
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's Oh snaps.

744
00:57:43,962 --> 00:57:44,224
Speaker 1: Yep.

745
00:57:44,445 --> 00:57:44,707
Speaker 1: Yep.

746
00:57:44,747 --> 00:57:48,730
Speaker 0: Yep I mean if you see to call for cheap or used pick it up.

747
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:55,790
Speaker 0: It's fun, especially if you if you're kind of new into German board gaming If you just played settlers and Carcassonne, you're looking for something more.

748
00:57:56,212 --> 00:58:01,370
Speaker 0: Tikal is definitely still one of those fun starter games and I highly recommend it for that.

749
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:07,831
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's definitely light enough that someone who's not the master can understand the game and how it works and have a lot of fun With it.

750
00:58:08,052 --> 00:58:08,292
Speaker 0: Yes.

751
00:58:08,373 --> 00:58:09,596
Speaker 0: It's really easy to teach.

752
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:12,223
Speaker 0: However, the rules are pretty piss-poor.

753
00:58:12,303 --> 00:58:12,965
Speaker 0: the rule book.

754
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:13,887
Speaker 1: Good.

755
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:14,910
Speaker 1: Maybe that's our rule book?

756
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:15,275
Speaker 1: I don't know.

757
00:58:15,295 --> 00:58:16,490
Speaker 1: Maybe the rules have been updated?

758
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:16,871
Speaker 1: I don't know.

759
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:27,898
Speaker 0: just go online and find an abridged rule instructions because this is one of those older games where the rules teach you by example and the rules rationalize things that don't need to be rationalized like.

760
00:58:27,918 --> 00:58:40,920
Speaker 0: the rule book goes out of its way to point out that the way guys get Between your camps is with secret passages and it says this a bunch of times and there's a lot of sentences in the rule book That provide no information at all.

761
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:42,666
Speaker 0: They are just there in your way.

762
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:43,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

763
00:58:43,549 --> 00:58:50,498
Speaker 1: alright I like the board games to have a theme or otherwise you get you know dice wars But what's wrong with dice wars?

764
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:55,670
Speaker 1: nothing, but at the same time I don't want the theme to be all up in the rules.

765
00:58:55,852 --> 00:59:02,949
Speaker 1: The theme should just be you know The pictures on the tiles and you know what the pieces look like or the kind of game or the kind of game it is.

766
00:59:03,272 --> 00:59:09,183
Speaker 1: Oh then again I mean But I don't want you to write about secret passages in the rules.

767
00:59:09,223 --> 00:59:13,968
Speaker 1: that where that doesn't mean anything everything that's written in the rules Should be how to play how the game work.

768
00:59:14,029 --> 00:59:23,697
Speaker 0: now You can cetera draw the secret passages or you could mention them in the sidebar or in a note or in a call-out Box or God call.

769
00:59:23,737 --> 00:59:27,290
Speaker 0: I've been doing physio too much for some sort of thing and it's okay.

770
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:30,845
Speaker 0: But the moment you clutter the actual rules with that garbage is no good is yonder.

771
00:59:31,227 --> 00:59:34,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's very under Sort of like it were actually.

772
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,186
Speaker 1: the secret passages reminded me of clue.

773
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:37,853
Speaker 0: Ah Clue.

774
00:59:37,873 --> 00:59:41,369
Speaker 0: there's a game that was fun when I was six and then I figured it out.

775
00:59:41,771 --> 00:59:44,303
Speaker 1: Yeah, if only that game was more complex, it would still be.

776
00:59:44,544 --> 00:59:45,750
Speaker 0: the worst thing is the best game.

777
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:58,730
Speaker 0: I used to piss my family off because basically the only strategy to clue is to Maximize your going around to all the rooms because the rooms is the only part that you can't just say.

778
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:05,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't just say in the billiard room unless you're in the billiard room But you can always say with the knife no matter where you are.

779
01:00:06,031 --> 01:00:18,838
Speaker 0: So what I would do is I'd go around to half the rooms real quick and then I'd sit in one room for like 10 rounds and I and I'd even say and I'd say that my family was so mad sad the knife in my hand and I had professor plum in my hand.

780
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:23,899
Speaker 0: I'd be like professor plum With the knife in the billiards room.

781
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:27,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then if no one said anything, I'd be like I win.

782
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:27,934
Speaker 0: You guys are all chumps.

783
01:00:28,316 --> 01:00:30,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, and no one thought to do things like that.

784
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:37,590
Speaker 1: So that's What is a very solvable and easy game, but I actually prefer Simpsons clue, which is more fun.

785
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:43,770
Speaker 0: That's how every German board game is eventually except for the true great classics and even those might be that way someday.

786
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:46,481
Speaker 0: We're just not smart enough to figure it out, which is good enough.

787
01:00:46,842 --> 01:00:48,952
Speaker 0: Yep, but like settlers and Tikal You'll.

788
01:00:48,972 --> 01:00:50,890
Speaker 0: eventually you'll figure them out and they won't be fun anymore.

789
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:57,521
Speaker 0: but if you're new into board gaming or you just really need to change it up check to call out if You're more discriminating.

790
01:00:57,884 --> 01:00:58,629
Speaker 0: Check out Java.

791
01:01:01,078 --> 01:01:01,761
Speaker 1: I never played it.

792
01:01:01,822 --> 01:01:03,410
Speaker 1: I played it once and I don't remember it.

793
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:11,114
Speaker 0: Here's the thing the Dragon's Den has it For kind of cheap because it's an open box and the only reason I didn't buy it last weekend was that I didn't want to Carry it around.

794
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll buy it next time.

795
01:01:13,187 --> 01:01:13,730
Speaker 0: I go to Mars.

796
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:14,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, think.

797
01:01:15,096 --> 01:01:21,600
Speaker 0: the other thing is I think there's also an open Java and millennium Because remember I got that end decker for like 25 bucks.

798
01:01:21,821 --> 01:01:22,684
Speaker 1: Well this weekend.
