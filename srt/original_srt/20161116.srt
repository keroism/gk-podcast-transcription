1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,330
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, November 16th, 2016.

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,543
Speaker 1: -Are you sure it's Wednesday?

3
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:14,150
Speaker 1: -Huh?

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,618
Speaker 1: -Are you sure it's Wednesday?

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,130
Speaker 1: -Uh, yeah.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,503
Speaker 1: -I just mess with you.

7
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:19,009
Speaker 0: -It's 100% Wednesday.

8
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,850
Speaker 1: [laughter] I know it's Wednesday, I'm just trying to hang in.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,229
Speaker 0: And tonight, we're talking about Squirrel Girl, the unbeatable.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,539
Speaker 1: -Squirrel Girl.

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,630
Speaker 0: -Squirrel Girl.

12
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,128
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:38,168
Speaker 0: You know, I probably complain about this about twice a year, maybe once a year at the most.

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,570
Speaker 0: But daylight saving time, kind of bullshit.

15
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:42,729
Speaker 0: And it's dark out.

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,430
Speaker 1: If I ever have a company, when the clock moves, I'm just going to move the work hours.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,449
Speaker 1: Everyone 8 to 4 now, because you'll leave, you know.

18
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:54,710
Speaker 0: I feel like the weight around this is we should just go back, like two hours, and stay there forever.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,670
Speaker 0: I want to get up in the dark, and I don't want it to be light until like 11 o'clock in the summer.

20
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:02,450
Speaker 1: You can just go back to using sundials.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, because then every hour is a different length of time.

22
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:08,900
Speaker 0: That's not good.

23
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:10,030
Speaker 0: Time matters.

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,138
Speaker 0: Got to keep track of time.

25
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:12,590
Speaker 0: Mustn't waste time.

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:13,890
Speaker 1: I was cherishing.

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,329
Speaker 1: But that would be awesome, because there would be a time of the year where like lunch is way long.

28
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think it would work out that way.

29
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,249
Speaker 1: It would be totally cool.

30
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,610
Speaker 1: We got to hook up sundials to our computers so that they can tell time.

31
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:29,069
Speaker 0: Cloud comes in, everything's fucked.

32
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,061
Speaker 0: Why are you late to the meeting?

33
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:31,770
Speaker 0: It was cloudy.

34
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:39,070
Speaker 0: So I got any news, it being anime day, because I've been not watching a lot of anime.

35
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,930
Speaker 0: I was watching Mob Psycho.

36
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,670
Speaker 1: It's not anime season right now.

37
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,030
Speaker 0: It was.

38
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:48,110
Speaker 0: I was watching a bunch of stuff, but I haven't watched enough to review anything, really.

39
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,570
Speaker 1: I think I watched, did I watch all of that Mob Psycho?

40
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:53,349
Speaker 0: I didn't finish it, but I watched a bunch of it.

41
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:57,130
Speaker 1: I think I did watch the whole thing, actually.

42
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I got distracted, and I started watching other stuff instead.

43
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:01,650
Speaker 1: You know, whatever.

44
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:03,409
Speaker 0: Westworld is way good.

45
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, Yul Brynner's the man.

46
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, the new Westworld.

47
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,588
Speaker 1: Fuck that noise.

48
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,330
Speaker 0: Scott, Scott, Scott.

49
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,569
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

50
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:23,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, well there's a non-news, right, which is that Miyazaki's coming out of retirement, he's going to make another movie, but we said that when he retired for the fifth time.

51
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,070
Speaker 1: So it's not a news, it's an old news.

52
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,169
Speaker 0: You know what he actually announced?

53
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,170
Speaker 0: I'm going to make another movie and hope I die during it so that I can die during my last movie's production.

54
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,670
Speaker 0: I feel like that is his only goal at this point.

55
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,846
Speaker 1: Someone beat you to that, but they weren't trying.

56
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,110
Speaker 0: Yup, and that movie didn't get made.

57
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,609
Speaker 1: So fuck that news.

58
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:43,409
Speaker 1: Is it real news?

59
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,408
Speaker 1: Is that the trailer for... That was my news!

60
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:49,387
Speaker 1: Sorry, deal with it.

61
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,350
Speaker 0: So yeah, your name is coming out, and there's the trailer.

62
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:53,510
Speaker 1: That's not my trailer.

63
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,430
Speaker 0: Oh, what's your trailer?

64
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,510
Speaker 1: Well, you just keep going.

65
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:05,786
Speaker 0: Alright, so the trailer for Makoto Shinkai's Kimi no Na Wa, which I haven't seen, but is based on numbers in his best movie.

66
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,930
Speaker 0: So I clicked on this trailer, and look, it's a girl, I assume, might be a guy.

67
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:11,910
Speaker 1: Nice clouds to get there.

68
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,349
Speaker 0: Looking up at a cloudy sky with a bunch of colorful shit going on.

69
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:17,847
Speaker 1: Sounds good.

70
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I mean, I guess it's coming out.

71
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,429
Speaker 0: I guess the news is actually...

72
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,770
Speaker 1: We had Crazy Box Office in Japan and Crazy Box Office in other countries.

73
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,945
Speaker 1: It's coming to the US, so...

74
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a dub cast, which I literally do not care about.

75
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:44,370
Speaker 1: I don't think it's going to be the movie that suddenly has a top tier AAA box office number for an anime in the US, but people are going to go see this, including you.

76
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:59,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm going to go see it at an ice theater in New York, probably with the subtitlies and not with this dub cast, which everyone's actually talking about the dub cast, and one, it's like the people you'd expect, and two, literally, why would you care who the dub cast is?

77
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:00,989
Speaker 1: Because you're not watching the dub.

78
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, the dubs are all the same in America.

79
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:08,210
Speaker 0: Either it's a Disney dub or it's a non-Disney dub.

80
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:09,029
Speaker 0: Those are your options.

81
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,350
Speaker 1: It's even funnier nowadays.

82
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:17,910
Speaker 1: I was scrolling through Anime News Network, and it was like dub cast announced for the anime with the big guy, My Love Story.

83
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:19,769
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it was a good show.

84
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:26,150
Speaker 1: It's like, I already watched that whole show on Crunchyroll with subtitles, months and months, possibly a year ago.

85
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,010
Speaker 1: A long time ago, I watched the whole show, and now you're dubbing it?

86
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,529
Speaker 1: It's like, why?

87
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:39,889
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, there are reasons to dub things for mass market because there's a wide chunk of America is really afraid of subtitles.

88
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,647
Speaker 1: Anyone who's interested in something that obscure has already seen it.

89
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,969
Speaker 0: But you only dub it if you're putting it on legit TV, and you're trying to make normal people watch it.

90
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:48,684
Speaker 1: Whatever.

91
00:04:49,253 --> 00:05:01,190
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, for whatever reason, going through my Twittersphere and also coming up on my news feeds, apparently there's an interview with the dub cast of the Sailor Moon R movie, which is the one we didn't watch and review.

92
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:03,490
Speaker 1: It's not the Candy Sky one?

93
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:13,848
Speaker 0: Candy Sky one is the Super S movie, Space Snow Demon, and also it's mostly about Luna is the S movie, and R movie is the-- Luna the Cat?

94
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, Luna the Cat is, that's actually the best Sailor Moon movie.

95
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:18,848
Speaker 1: I should check that out.

96
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,250
Speaker 0: We should watch and do a show on it.

97
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,710
Speaker 0: It's short, and it's actually pretty good.

98
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,350
Speaker 1: Does it stand alone?

99
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:24,723
Speaker 0: Yeah.

100
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:28,290
Speaker 0: All you need to know is, do you know that Sailor Moon exists?

101
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,330
Speaker 1: She punishes people.

102
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,749
Speaker 0: You know that Luna is her cat, and that Luna is kind of also a human form, alien, whatever, but that never comes up in the show.

103
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,509
Speaker 1: Yes, I know all those things.

104
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,848
Speaker 0: You know everything you need to know.

105
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,330
Speaker 0: Sailor Scouts do fuck all in that movie.

106
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:42,669
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

107
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:46,089
Speaker 0: Also, it's a Christmas movie, kind of.

108
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,707
Speaker 0: So I feel like we should do it as our Christmas show.

109
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:57,589
Speaker 0: And the R movie, which is the one that I guess, it's about a gay plant that comes from space and tries to kidnap Tuxedo Mask.

110
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,889
Speaker 1: That sounds like a One Piece movie.

111
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:03,550
Speaker 0: It actually is a lot like that One Piece movie with the plant that kills everybody.

112
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,847
Speaker 1: All right, so that was your news.

113
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,490
Speaker 0: So what trailer are you talking about?

114
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,330
Speaker 0: I assume this is the trailer you were talking about.

115
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:13,330
Speaker 1: The crappy live action Ghost in the Shell trailer.

116
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:15,710
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I guess that's right.

117
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:20,989
Speaker 0: Well, I clicked on this trailer, and all it did was put even more colors and clouds up.

118
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:35,590
Speaker 1: Anyway, so it was whitewashed, as promised, and it's Ghost in the Shell, as promised, and it's visually good-looking, but everything that I can gather from the trailer.

119
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:37,070
Speaker 0: One origin story.

120
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:40,470
Speaker 0: The least interesting part of Ghost in the Shell.

121
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:45,310
Speaker 1: Whoever wrote this did not try to adapt Ghost in the Shell.

122
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:55,910
Speaker 1: All they did was take the characters and visuals and setting and made, at least, this is what I can gather from the trailer, but trailers these days, you can usually gather the whole movie from them.

123
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,409
Speaker 1: They're done that way on purpose.

124
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:11,969
Speaker 1: They basically took a generic action movie plot of someone with a mysterious past having to fight bad guys and just slapped it onto Ghost in the Shell characters and setting without actually bringing along the real Ghost in the Shell plot.

125
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:14,210
Speaker 0: Now, granted, it's all fighting cyber crime.

126
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,206
Speaker 1: Ghost in the Shell is tricky, because depending on-- Which is the only part of Ghost in the Shell that mattered.

127
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,749
Speaker 1: It took the parts that didn't matter, and they got rid of the part that did.

128
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,230
Speaker 0: I mean, the good parts of Ghost in the Shell barely involve the source material.

129
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:33,170
Speaker 0: It's just you want stand-alone complex, you want stand-alone complex second gig, and you want the two movies.

130
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,869
Speaker 1: Right, the best Ghost in the Shells are the ones where it's like-- The manga's all goon-y, and then it gets sexy.

131
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,070
Speaker 1: It's like procedural cyber crime.

132
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,241
Speaker 1: It's about the bad guy.

133
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:43,310
Speaker 1: How do we catch this bad guy?

134
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,036
Speaker 1: What are they up to?

135
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:50,669
Speaker 1: Oh, they're brain-dubbing, or they're, you know, they're terrorists doing-- You know, it's always about the bad guy.

136
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,928
Speaker 0: Or you want, like, Botto be at all philosophical, and like, "Oh, what does it mean for me to

137
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:55,030
Speaker 0: live?".

138
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,910
Speaker 1: Or, like, you know, they're hacking into policemen's eyeballs.

139
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:09,589
Speaker 1: It's like, it's always about that, and then they happen-- Section 9 happens to be these people who just are really good at fighting crime, and they find the bad guy, stop them, learn from them.

140
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,957
Speaker 1: Moral of the story.

141
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:12,470
Speaker 1: That's what Ghost in the Shell is supposed to be.

142
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,130
Speaker 1: This movie is gonna be about Section 9, and no one wants that garbage, right?

143
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,589
Speaker 0: Well, you do, but you want it the way Stand Alone Complex did it in second gig.

144
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,546
Speaker 0: Remember, they had those flashbacks like, "How did this guy join the

145
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:25,790
Speaker 0: team?".

146
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,387
Speaker 0: And they're like, "Well, here's an interesting segment from how this guy joined the

147
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:29,610
Speaker 0: team.".

148
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's two seconds long.

149
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,361
Speaker 0: They each got an episode.

150
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:33,049
Speaker 0: Barely.

151
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:34,399
Speaker 0: It was a whole episode.

152
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:38,789
Speaker 0: Remember the one where-- The sniper episode where you get that awesome sniper stand-off?

153
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:43,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, but all you actually learn about-- Oh, they did something with the

154
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:44,309
Speaker 0: U.N.?

155
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:44,430
Speaker 0: ?

156
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,099
Speaker 0: Something, something?

157
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:45,970
Speaker 0: Okay, we're back in the present.

158
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,091
Speaker 1: Right.

159
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,070
Speaker 1: All you learn about it, you don't learn his past and his deep inner feelings.

160
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,608
Speaker 1: All you learn is like, "Oh, yeah, he joined the team because they were in a sniper battle, and he was so good that the Major was like, 'Hey, join

161
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:55,729
Speaker 1: me.'".

162
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,109
Speaker 1: That's all you learn.

163
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:15,370
Speaker 0: To push forward the ideas and the setting, and when there's serious long-term origin story-esque plot, it's like the stuff with the Major and Kuzi, which is mostly hinted at, as opposed to this movie, which looks like it's literally, "Oh, yeah, remember that Kuzi guy?

164
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,970
Speaker 0: Let's just follow that plot, and she's a superhero.

165
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:18,880
Speaker 0: She's basically

166
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,408
Speaker 0: Spider-Man.".

167
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:26,090
Speaker 1: I think the only positive thing is that Aramakis looks to be played by Takeshi Kitano.

168
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,430
Speaker 0: Yes, that fits.

169
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,741
Speaker 1: They did one good thing.

170
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:29,205
Speaker 1: Congratulations.

171
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:32,450
Speaker 0: All I want-- I don't even like Arise that much.

172
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:44,489
Speaker 0: All I want is more Ushi movies, which he'll never do, or more stand-alone complex, which is literally at this point my favorite non-evangelian anime ever made.

173
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,370
Speaker 0: That's all I want out of anime is more stand-alone complex.

174
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:52,950
Speaker 1: Well, maybe if this movie's a way hit, then I'll make some more animes.

175
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:59,070
Speaker 0: You need the people who are making the new Westworld to make a live-action procedural Ghost in the Shell stand-alone complex.

176
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,086
Speaker 1: Well, maybe they'll make a TV show after the movie's--.

177
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, depends.

178
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,607
Speaker 1: That's why I think you don't whitewash the TV show, also.

179
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:13,849
Speaker 0: Someone pointed out that in one of the trailers, only white people talk and only Asian people get shot.

180
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.

181
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:16,209
Speaker 1: I believe it.

182
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,360
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

183
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:26,659
Speaker 0: When you think of a kaleidoscope, what do you think of?

184
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:27,920
Speaker 1: A kaleidoscope?

185
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:28,191
Speaker 0: Yeah.

186
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,935
Speaker 1: That's when you look inside and you spin it and you see,

187
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:31,398
Speaker 1: "Whoa!".

188
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see,

189
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:32,833
Speaker 0: "Whoa!".

190
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:34,740
Speaker 0: When do you think those were invented?

191
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:36,640
Speaker 1: When were they invented?

192
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,140
Speaker 1: Probably-- Well, I guess they needed optics, right?

193
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,920
Speaker 1: So, after Galileo times.

194
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:42,576
Speaker 0: Yeah.

195
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:48,980
Speaker 0: But probably before the-- You know, earliest-- What action in Civ VI boosts the development of kaleidoscopes?

196
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:54,520
Speaker 1: Probably something related to boats, because that's where they're making spy glasses and shit.

197
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,082
Speaker 0: So, 1816.

198
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:56,820
Speaker 1: That seems about it.

199
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,073
Speaker 1: Yeah.

200
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,718
Speaker 1: But-- They had boats.

201
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,139
Speaker 0: What do you think they were invented for?

202
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:04,260
Speaker 0: What was their purpose?

203
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:06,440
Speaker 1: They had a purpose?

204
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, so-- Other than entertainment value?

205
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:18,696
Speaker 0: Basically, kaleidoscopes were seen as this philosophical and scientific tool, and then the plebs were like, "Ooh,

206
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:19,078
Speaker 0: pretty!".

207
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:30,580
Speaker 0: And all the scientists and thinkers of the day thought that people were obsessed with kaleidoscopes, and they were a weird and surprisingly powerful pop culture phenomenon.

208
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:36,997
Speaker 0: And this is an article going into the details of the kaleidoscomaniacs of the 1800s.

209
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:40,280
Speaker 1: So, it was the "Tickle Me Elmo" of its day?

210
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,340
Speaker 0: It was more like the iPhone of its day.

211
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,660
Speaker 0: Like, thinkers would bitch about how young people don't pay attention to the real world anymore.

212
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,552
Speaker 1: Or like, "Yeah, you got last year's kaleidoscope.

213
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:49,176
Speaker 1: I got that

214
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:49,337
Speaker 1: too.".

215
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:50,095
Speaker 1: Yeah.

216
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:51,794
Speaker 1: "I got that since this year's model is

217
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:52,097
Speaker 1: better.".

218
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:58,500
Speaker 0: In 1819, New Monthly magazine listed the kaleidoscope as the most important invention and discovery of our times.

219
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,040
Speaker 1: Are you sure that this isn't fake and this is real?

220
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,460
Speaker 0: No, so I was looking-- I read a lot more about this.

221
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:04,340
Speaker 0: It's a pretty in-depth article.

222
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,968
Speaker 0: Check Snopes on this.

223
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:05,960
Speaker 1: This could be fake.

224
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,699
Speaker 0: Basically-- oh, you want to talk about kaleidoscope piracy?

225
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:10,299
Speaker 1: This could be fake.

226
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:12,180
Speaker 0: No, this is pretty legit.

227
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:16,070
Speaker 0: I've read some primary sources on this, but basically-- I'm just saying "could be

228
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,392
Speaker 0: fake.".

229
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:16,997
Speaker 1: I didn't say "is

230
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:17,300
Speaker 1: fake.".

231
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:21,060
Speaker 0: I was not 100% convinced when I first encountered this article.

232
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,119
Speaker 0: It's been sitting in my queue of things of the day for a long time.

233
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:29,459
Speaker 0: But the history of the kaleidoscope is way weirder than you thought it was.

234
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,580
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

235
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,097
Speaker 1: So there's this quickdraw.withgoogle.com.

236
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,819
Speaker 1: It's been around, but I guess not everyone's seen it.

237
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,160
Speaker 1: So I cheated on it with my magic pencil.

238
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,220
Speaker 1: And basically, it's an AI learning thing plus Google.

239
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,154
Speaker 1: So you push "Let's

240
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:44,419
Speaker 1: draw."

241
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,216
Speaker 1: And then it says, "Hey, draw

242
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:46,639
Speaker 1: something.".

243
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,600
Speaker 0: And then you draw what, a dick?

244
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:48,499
Speaker 1: It tells you what to draw.

245
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,700
Speaker 1: So it's telling me to draw a mouse.

246
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,799
Speaker 1: So I'm going to try to draw a mouse.

247
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,787
Speaker 0: Draw a stereo.

248
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:52,860
Speaker 0: All right, I'm going to do it right now.

249
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:58,716
Speaker 1: And then it uses machine learning to try to figure out, you know, like what?

250
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:01,560
Speaker 1: if you've, you know.

251
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:01,918
Speaker 1: All right.

252
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:02,939
Speaker 0: I'm drawing a stereo.

253
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:03,980
Speaker 0: Oh, what?

254
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,239
Speaker 0: You figured it out.

255
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:14,080
Speaker 1: You have a time limit to draw, to basically convince the machine learning thing that you've drawn what it wants you to draw.

256
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,858
Speaker 1: So it'll be like, you know, draw a mouse and you've got 20 seconds.

257
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,860
Speaker 0: I got my cactus.

258
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,880
Speaker 1: You can draw for 20 seconds until the, you know, AI recognize it as a cactus.

259
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:23,340
Speaker 1: Duck?

260
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,579
Speaker 0: I can't draw a duck for shit.

261
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,979
Speaker 0: It's actually really hard.

262
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,718
Speaker 0: I can't draw.

263
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:28,139
Speaker 0: That's a duck.

264
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:31,338
Speaker 0: I think that's a pretty good duck.

265
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:32,800
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

266
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,798
Speaker 1: So this is, that's what this is.

267
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,900
Speaker 0: It didn't think I drew a duck.

268
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:35,340
Speaker 0: The fuck?

269
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:35,857
Speaker 1: That's a duck.

270
00:13:36,704 --> 00:13:37,020
Speaker 1: It's pretty.

271
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,820
Speaker 0: I see an aircraft, Harrier helicopter bird.

272
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:39,180
Speaker 0: Okay.

273
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:40,119
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

274
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,140
Speaker 1: It's pretty interesting.

275
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,759
Speaker 0: I could, I could spend some time messing around with that.

276
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:45,376
Speaker 1: That's it.

277
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:46,120
Speaker 0: All right.

278
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,799
Speaker 0: In the moment.

279
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,680
Speaker 0: The book club book is Rebecca.

280
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,520
Speaker 1: Once, once it's holidays, I'll be able to read a book.

281
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,320
Speaker 0: So you didn't start reading yet?

282
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,180
Speaker 0: That's good because I was going to read it.

283
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,680
Speaker 1: I did start reading it and then I stopped and I haven't picked it up again.

284
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,780
Speaker 1: Instead I read it because I'm doing other stuff.

285
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,640
Speaker 0: I read the entire second book of the mad Adam trilogy after Oryx and Craig.

286
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:05,175
Speaker 1: Okay.

287
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,819
Speaker 0: It's real good.

288
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:11,759
Speaker 0: Like, I think the second and second book might be better than Oryx and Craig.

289
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:21,259
Speaker 0: It just, it basically, it looks at other parts of the world during the same time period as the events of the book, the first book.

290
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,160
Speaker 0: So it's like some people in the plea blends with the cheeky knobs and all that biz, and you learn about how the gardeners were set up.

291
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,620
Speaker 0: It was pretty good.

292
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,092
Speaker 0: I was digging it.

293
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:32,020
Speaker 0: So I guess I can finish the third book before you start reading Rebecca.

294
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:34,876
Speaker 1: I did start reading Rebecca, so you can't.

295
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:43,959
Speaker 0: Uh, otherwise check out both our youtube channels cause we're doing stuff and now that it's the holidays and we're kind of home and quiet, a lot more stuff's going to be coming in.

296
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,860
Speaker 1: I'm not home and quiet until after Thanksgiving.

297
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,676
Speaker 0: What do you mean home?

298
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,280
Speaker 0: What are we doing?

299
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,939
Speaker 0: We have nothing.

300
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:57,076
Speaker 0: Our next convention, our next convention is magfest, which I guess I got to write that fucking panel on quitting stuff like every goddamn day I got.

301
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,196
Speaker 1: no, I can't even clean my apartment.

302
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:58,965
Speaker 0: Yeah.

303
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:00,840
Speaker 0: I'm catching up on stuff.

304
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:02,219
Speaker 0: I've been working on a lot of things.

305
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:08,019
Speaker 0: I got to think about cutting certain other things that are big responsibilities out of my life, which might affect a lot of people.

306
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:09,239
Speaker 0: We'll see how that goes.

307
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,700
Speaker 0: That sounds ominous to some of you and it should, but don't worry.

308
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,919
Speaker 0: It doesn't affect geek nights or any of the stuff you're looking at here.

309
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:23,039
Speaker 0: Uh, I guess pack south submissions closed for panels like just now because they extended the deadlines a bunch of times.

310
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:28,338
Speaker 0: So if you submitted a panel back south, I guess maybe there's a better chance you'll get one than usual.

311
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,080
Speaker 1: Cause they're desperate.

312
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:31,339
Speaker 0: Uh, worries me a little.

313
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,536
Speaker 0: Could be submitted three.

314
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,538
Speaker 0: Let's see if they give us three.

315
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:39,199
Speaker 0: That'd be like the old packs east where we do three or four every year to be worth it considering it's a trip.

316
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,458
Speaker 1: Right?

317
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:39,898
Speaker 0: Yeah.

318
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,060
Speaker 0: I mean, I already booked my flights.

319
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,697
Speaker 0: Like I'm all set.

320
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,076
Speaker 1: Yeah.

321
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,760
Speaker 1: I booked everything.

322
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,748
Speaker 0: And I'm not doing that weird thing.

323
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:52,377
Speaker 0: I did last year where I ran from the panel to fly to New Hampshire to go skiing because the people who run that trip are like, turns out they're white supremacists.

324
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,579
Speaker 0: So bailed on them and not going on that trip ever again.

325
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:57,740
Speaker 1: Otherwise.

326
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:58,592
Speaker 0: Yep.

327
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,357
Speaker 0: Follow our stuff.

328
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,840
Speaker 1: I mean, if you go skiing, skiing is a really super white people thing.

329
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,660
Speaker 0: You know, I have this anecdote from a long time ago where I was at Hunter mountain.

330
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:18,230
Speaker 0: It's unlikely you're going to see, cause I have a basically in finance, you get Martin Luther King day off, which I learned when I became an adult, cause I grew up in Detroit where also you got Martin Luther King day off.

331
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,499
Speaker 0: that and a lot of the South, you don't get Martin Luther King day off.

332
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:21,999
Speaker 1: Nope.

333
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:30,494
Speaker 0: So I tended to always go skiing and MLK day and it's always a great day cause like it's a holiday, but a lot of people don't actually have that day off, which is kind of fucked up.

334
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,739
Speaker 0: But that's an aside.

335
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:39,099
Speaker 0: And I just remember there's this dude who works on a mountain and he's just this cool dude and he is a black dude just happens to be.

336
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,200
Speaker 0: And one year I came in and he's standing there and he's like greeting everyone to come in.

337
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,619
Speaker 0: He's like celebrate the blackest day in history with the whitest sport on earth.

338
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:49,738
Speaker 0: And he was just being really funny.

339
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:53,460
Speaker 0: That is my anecdote, but yeah, we're not going on that trip anymore.

340
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:04,898
Speaker 1: So squirrel girl, you actually read every page and every word of every page and every word of both of those started with the big book that has like the bad one.

341
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:14,040
Speaker 0: Well, I wouldn't say bad, but it was a sampling of the history of this character throughout comics.

342
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:14,679
Speaker 1: It's not a sampling.

343
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,999
Speaker 1: That's pretty much is the history.

344
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:24,626
Speaker 0: My thoughts on the origin of squirrel girl is that that was some ugly, ugly and like even for the day.

345
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:26,755
Speaker 0: that was some ugly shit like Dr.

346
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,040
Speaker 0: Doom, fine.

347
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,880
Speaker 0: That Durfee old Iron Man, Iron Man, sure.

348
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,380
Speaker 0: But the fuck if I was Iron Man, I might've killed her cause I was afraid of her.

349
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,539
Speaker 0: I think she's some sort of demon.

350
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,940
Speaker 1: Well, she's also like 14 years old technically at that point.

351
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:40,860
Speaker 0: But what did that I make up?

352
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,299
Speaker 0: Like who thought that was a thing?

353
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:43,760
Speaker 1: So right.

354
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,297
Speaker 1: So when I was a kid and I read superhero comics a ton, right, this was.

355
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:56,960
Speaker 1: there was sort of this thing where it was like a tradition almost of, you know, you would make non serious parody comics like self parody, right?

356
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:02,377
Speaker 1: There would be like Spider Ham or, uh, you know, the characters that were just complete nonsense.

357
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,989
Speaker 1: Like there was a character called slapstick who was literally like a living cartoon or something.

358
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,960
Speaker 0: So was Howard the duck on purpose or was he really part of that?

359
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:09,780
Speaker 1: I'd ever read that.

360
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,175
Speaker 1: So I don't know.

361
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:10,537
Speaker 0: I did.

362
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,259
Speaker 0: You ever see the movie?

363
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:12,160
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

364
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:13,439
Speaker 1: Super long time ago.

365
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,539
Speaker 0: We should watch it again as adults and review it.

366
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:15,790
Speaker 1: No.

367
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:16,260
Speaker 1: Right.

368
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,280
Speaker 1: But you know, so there'd be all these characters that like weren't like canon characters, right?

369
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:24,980
Speaker 1: Even characters like Spiderman would have serious times and silly times.

370
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,560
Speaker 1: You could buy a silly Spiderman comic and a serious one.

371
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,880
Speaker 0: Like when I was a kid in like the eighties and nineties, there were the what if comics are like, what if they're all became zombies?

372
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:32,940
Speaker 1: Right.

373
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:40,020
Speaker 1: And some things are Canon and some things warrant, but there were certain characters where the entirety of the character was a joke in and of itself.

374
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,820
Speaker 1: So squirrel girl actually was not that kind of character originally.

375
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,100
Speaker 1: You saw the original appearance.

376
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:48,900
Speaker 1: She was just like this side character, horrible demon, right?

377
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,760
Speaker 1: The side character in one issue of iron man or something, right?

378
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:53,398
Speaker 1: Just randomly.

379
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:01,980
Speaker 1: She shows up and that's where pretty much all superhero, you know, side characters come from that sort of thing, right?

380
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,540
Speaker 1: It used to be back in the day, there were only so many comics on the, you know, and the, not even on the shelf in the bookstore, it'd be the drug store, right?

381
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,640
Speaker 1: You could get Spiderman, Superman, Fantastic Four, you know, there's only so many, it wasn't like today where there's 50 something titles.

382
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,500
Speaker 1: So all those other characters started out as side characters in these other things.

383
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,520
Speaker 1: Like the, in humans, there wasn't an in humans comic, it's just, you would read Fantastic Four and there'd be in humans all over the place, right?

384
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,296
Speaker 1: That's where they came from.

385
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,900
Speaker 1: So and nowadays, since it's been going on for so long, they keep running out of material.

386
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:43,720
Speaker 1: They are constantly digging through old books to get, you know, new or old, you know, characters is like, oh, this character already exists.

387
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,020
Speaker 1: It's already IP that we own.

388
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,140
Speaker 1: I don't need to bother designing a new character.

389
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,880
Speaker 1: I can just bring this old one back and the bed.

390
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Speaker 0: They're not in that many comics.

391
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:57,539
Speaker 1: So if you're worried about your continuity, there's not that you can sort of do what you want with them, but you have something to work with.

392
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,240
Speaker 1: And it also, you know, makes fanboys excited because, oh my God, I remember that, you know?

393
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:02,696
Speaker 1: Yeah.

394
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,797
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, you say that, but when you saw Boba Fett again, you were like, oh shit, that guy.

395
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,920
Speaker 0: Oh, oh man.

396
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:09,436
Speaker 0: Boba Fett.

397
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:10,160
Speaker 1: Sure.

398
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,312
Speaker 0: I mean, that's how it goes.

399
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,699
Speaker 0: Boba Fett.

400
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,018
Speaker 0: Boba Fett.

401
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,859
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Squirrel Girl was in this like one Iron Man throwaway comic a super long time ago.

402
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,397
Speaker 0: But she beat the shit out of Dr.

403
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:19,600
Speaker 0: Doom.

404
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,058
Speaker 1: Right.

405
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,660
Speaker 1: It was, it was just a silly comic.

406
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:21,897
Speaker 1: Right.

407
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,860
Speaker 1: And then what happened was, I guess in the nineties or eighties, nineties, right.

408
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:27,619
Speaker 0: That second one.

409
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,070
Speaker 1: Yeah.

410
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:37,060
Speaker 0: So like that felt like if I, if I was going to make a comic that was like a parody of what nineties comics were like, that thing was like spot on.

411
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:41,718
Speaker 1: So in the nineties, they would, they, the Avengers got split up into two different comic books.

412
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:49,477
Speaker 1: There was the East Coast Avengers and the West Coast Avengers, like the East Coast Avengers was like Captain America, such and such in the West Coast, I think was Iron Man, such and such.

413
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:49,756
Speaker 1: Right.

414
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:54,260
Speaker 1: And so as a joke, they were like, lol, Great Lakes Avengers.

415
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,575
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

416
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:57,098
Speaker 1: You know, joke.

417
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,600
Speaker 1: And it was all these silly characters like Deadpool was involved, which already means it's going to be stupid.

418
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:03,091
Speaker 1: Yup.

419
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:03,718
Speaker 1: Right.

420
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,839
Speaker 1: So Squirrel Girl was sort of like a really, you know, important character on the Great Lakes Avengers.

421
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:14,743
Speaker 0: Well, because she was pretty much other than the immortal guy, the most powerful and competent one.

422
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,520
Speaker 1: Right.

423
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,820
Speaker 1: Because basically it was, you know, that's, that's the joke of Squirrel Girl.

424
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,960
Speaker 0: Even though, what's that guy's name is the immortal guy.

425
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,899
Speaker 0: I already lost track.

426
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:23,420
Speaker 0: All their names.

427
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:23,840
Speaker 1: I don't know.

428
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,618
Speaker 0: Cause it's all dumb.

429
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,800
Speaker 1: I don't remember anyone's name.

430
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,039
Speaker 0: Cause he's friends with death urge.

431
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:27,840
Speaker 0: I guess.

432
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:28,235
Speaker 1: I don't know.

433
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,518
Speaker 0: Who I kept confusing with the doorman cause they look the same.

434
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:37,040
Speaker 1: So anyway, the joke of Squirrel Girl is that she's a girl with the power to talk to squirrels basically.

435
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,659
Speaker 0: But she also has the proportional speed and strength of squirrels.

436
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:41,995
Speaker 1: Right.

437
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,917
Speaker 1: And she's basically Aquaman of squirrels.

438
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:46,219
Speaker 1: Only a girl.

439
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:46,798
Speaker 0: Yeah.

440
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:49,780
Speaker 1: And that's usually a really stupid power.

441
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,179
Speaker 1: What could you possibly do with that?

442
00:21:52,320 --> 00:22:01,500
Speaker 1: That's so great, but she's actually not like, you know, usually when someone has a stupid power, these stupid characters, they're, they're also dumb themselves, right?

443
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,660
Speaker 1: Like there's a Spider-Man villain who's like the frog or something, I think frog.

444
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,740
Speaker 1: And he's just like frog man or some shit.

445
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,480
Speaker 1: He's just a dumb ass wearing a frog suit.

446
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,900
Speaker 1: It's like a joke, but squirrel girl, isn't a joke.

447
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:14,360
Speaker 1: Only her power is a joke, right?

448
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:18,240
Speaker 1: She's like totally smart and knows how to, you know, fight stuff.

449
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:28,580
Speaker 0: And it seems like the going theme with her is that she's the unbeatable squirrel girl because the situation she is up in are just like, man, the only thing that would save the day here is this oddly specific power.

450
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,536
Speaker 0: Hey, squirrel girl.

451
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:30,075
Speaker 1: Yup.

452
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,586
Speaker 0: Whoa.

453
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:41,978
Speaker 1: So what happened was, is there squirrel girl was, you know, sort of made into, you know, brought back as a character in the nineties, two thousands, great lakes, Avengers kind of thing.

454
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,290
Speaker 1: Right.

455
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:46,920
Speaker 1: And then even then it was still just a joke kind of thing for superhero nerds.

456
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,280
Speaker 1: It wasn't anything anyone cared about.

457
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,700
Speaker 0: I mean, that nineties squirrel girl stuff was very, I'm pretty sure it was nineties.

458
00:22:51,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Speaker 0: I did not check, but it was just so like, like it had all these self referential callback jokes to the superhero fandom that like Deadpool with his car.

459
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:02,700
Speaker 1: That's what it was about.

460
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:02,980
Speaker 1: Right.

461
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:07,160
Speaker 1: It was just a, you know, jokes for, it was, you know, inside jokes for inside superhero.

462
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,118
Speaker 0: But it was also that like, we're going to be like edgy and hardcore, like comics tried to be for a while then.

463
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:14,899
Speaker 1: Anyway, I only made rim read that garbage so he could suffer through it.

464
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:31,640
Speaker 0: But I, you know, maybe it's just because I have not consumed that like grim dark, like toilet joke nineties era comics in a long time, but I kind of enjoyed it even though like at one time I'm looking at it like this artifact from a bygone era.

465
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:36,140
Speaker 0: And on the other hand, I'm sort of appreciating that it existed in its time and place.

466
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,180
Speaker 1: There's plenty more where that came from because you could do nothing but read that shit for like the rest of your life.

467
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,580
Speaker 0: I mean, you want like 80 pages of suicide jokes.

468
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,316
Speaker 0: Well there you go.

469
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:45,680
Speaker 1: There it was.

470
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,779
Speaker 1: So anyway, uh, what happened more recently is they brought back squirrel girl in her own comic book and it's good.

471
00:23:53,461 --> 00:23:56,957
Speaker 1: And the writer is Ryan North, the dinosaur comics guy, right?

472
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:59,419
Speaker 1: So you already know it's going to be good.

473
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:00,758
Speaker 1: And of course it is good.

474
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:02,098
Speaker 1: It's way good.

475
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:02,559
Speaker 1: Yup.

476
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:03,980
Speaker 1: And he totally stands alone.

477
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:05,620
Speaker 1: You don't need to know any superhero shit.

478
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:13,880
Speaker 1: And it's not just for superhero nerds, even though it still has the basic structure of a superhero comic where every issue you have to fight a bad guy somehow.

479
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:33,460
Speaker 0: And it's interesting because the like nineties, middle era of squirrel girl would make these fairy comic book guy references to the old bullshit or they would do homage that you could not understand unless you'd read those old like weird golden age, silver age comics where you'd see like that character keeps explaining what he's doing while he does it.

480
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,418
Speaker 0: And that's the joke.

481
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:43,589
Speaker 0: But the new squirrel girl will still reference the old crap, but in a funny offhanded way that is not in Trent, like it's not.

482
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:46,060
Speaker 0: like it's not funny if you haven't read that old stuff.

483
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,079
Speaker 0: It's just like an Easter egg.

484
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:47,639
Speaker 1: It's weird.

485
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,080
Speaker 1: Like despite the, you know, who knows what's canon and what's not right.

486
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,437
Speaker 1: But despite this being a brand new squirrel girl, that's not nothing like the old one at all.

487
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,480
Speaker 0: It pointedly is like, yeah, she beat iron man and dr doom and all that business, right?

488
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,560
Speaker 1: She acts like all those things totally happened.

489
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,799
Speaker 1: And she's got Deadpool's trading cards to tell her about all the bad guys cause right.

490
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,340
Speaker 1: Cause all that Deadpool stuff actually happened and you know, and all this stuff.

491
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,480
Speaker 1: So, and also I want the Deadpool trading cards to tell you about all the villains.

492
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,998
Speaker 1: Those are way better than the superhero cards I collected when I collected those X-Men ones and there were multiple series of them.

493
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:21,560
Speaker 1: I got that.

494
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,218
Speaker 0: I had a lot of, I also have a complete set of the second Wolverine series, including a bunch of the foils.

495
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,320
Speaker 1: I got a, I got a bunch of cards in my closet.

496
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,120
Speaker 1: I could dig them out.

497
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:30,496
Speaker 1: Yeah.

498
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,897
Speaker 0: Let's dig them out and I don't know, burn them or sell them or, but anyway, so the deal with the new squirrel girl, right?

499
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:38,020
Speaker 1: Is that she's going to college.

500
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,157
Speaker 1: So I guess when she was 14 when she met iron man, she's college age now.

501
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:45,080
Speaker 1: that's, you can use that to measure all other time passing in the Marvel universe.

502
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,038
Speaker 1: Good luck with that.

503
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,767
Speaker 0: How do you even know she ages like a human.

504
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:49,656
Speaker 0: squirrels live like 30 years.

505
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,640
Speaker 0: So if she has the, oh shit, she's in trouble.

506
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,717
Speaker 0: But if she has the proportional squirrel shit, then she's probably gonna live like 900 years or less.

507
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,680
Speaker 0: No, because she's, cause squirrels are small and strong for their size.

508
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,200
Speaker 0: She's bigger, but proportionally stronger.

509
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:11,180
Speaker 0: So she's probably gonna live a really long time or, or a lot less time.

510
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,579
Speaker 0: I think she's gonna live a really long time.

511
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,960
Speaker 0: Anyway, isn't even a picture of frog man on the, I don't know if it's called fraud.

512
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,689
Speaker 1: I don't know if his name is actually frog man.

513
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:27,319
Speaker 1: search for like spider alter ego, Eugene Paul, but search for like spider man, frog villain or something and see what comes up.

514
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:29,359
Speaker 0: Spider man, frog man.

515
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,132
Speaker 1: All right.

516
00:26:31,683 --> 00:26:31,774
Speaker 1: Yeah.

517
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,100
Speaker 1: Wow.

518
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,515
Speaker 1: That's him.

519
00:26:33,006 --> 00:26:33,499
Speaker 1: That's the guy.

520
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:34,158
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

521
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,420
Speaker 0: I never realized venture brothers making fun of this guy.

522
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:46,899
Speaker 0: There's this dude who comes into to audition to join a super villain squad and he stands there in a frog suit that looks almost exactly like this and he throws a brick and he's like brick frog and they're like, nope.

523
00:26:50,163 --> 00:26:53,115
Speaker 1: Anyway, uh, so squirrel girls now in her twenties or something.

524
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:54,900
Speaker 1: and she decides because she's so awesome.

525
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:03,918
Speaker 1: She's going to go to college, which is difficult for someone who doesn't have parents, at least no parents that we know of doesn't have money that I don't know where she gets money from.

526
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:06,760
Speaker 1: Uh, I, did she even go to school?

527
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:07,779
Speaker 1: I guess she's intelligent.

528
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:16,198
Speaker 1: Maybe she got a scholarship or I don't know, but she's going to college and she is going to stop living in the Avengers attic and I don't know.

529
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:17,700
Speaker 1: And so they're off.

530
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,019
Speaker 0: She goes, I like how tippy toes is all like you're not majoring in squirrels and she's like, ah, I already know everything about squirrels.

531
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:36,700
Speaker 1: Except then she didn't sure, but I guess she's going to study computer science, which is cool except they never show any computer science stuff that she's learning because she's too distracted actually doing superhero crap.

532
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:39,600
Speaker 1: I wish that she would, they would show some computer science action though.

533
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:39,986
Speaker 1: Cool.

534
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:40,620
Speaker 1: Right.

535
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,679
Speaker 1: It's like what, you know, just saying that you're studying computer science is nice.

536
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:48,080
Speaker 1: Actually doing computer science and showing it in the book would be nicer.

537
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,000
Speaker 0: She should have tied his tongue in a whatever, not instead of a whatever, not sure.

538
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,275
Speaker 0: I can't quote Simpsons verbatim like I used to.

539
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:59,780
Speaker 1: Uh, and you know, there's a little bit of school drama going on, right?

540
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,640
Speaker 1: There's like some cute boy and there's an awesome roommate.

541
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,140
Speaker 0: The characters are all just pretty good.

542
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:11,500
Speaker 1: Like if you didn't know, it's a lot like the old Spiderman comics where like there would be the high school drama to go with the Spiderman drama.

543
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:23,200
Speaker 0: Like, you know, flash Thompson, was that who it is, but you know, and like Gwen and whatever and all, but like this comic would sit right alongside all those quote unquote indie comics that you just get it like the mocha fast and you wouldn't even blink.

544
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,493
Speaker 1: Like if you didn't know this, it didn't happen to have all these Marvel heroes and villains in it.

545
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:27,835
Speaker 0: Yup.

546
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:34,300
Speaker 0: But even then the way they are portrayed and presented and used is still like pretty secondary.

547
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,860
Speaker 0: Like it's still like, it's just, it's set up like a modern comic and not like that old nonsense.

548
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:39,280
Speaker 1: Right.

549
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,300
Speaker 1: And all the dialogue and such is sort of adventure timey, right?

550
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,411
Speaker 1: Where they're being, they're being serious, but they're not, you know, talking like normal people.

551
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:55,160
Speaker 1: They're talking in a slightly silly way, but still saying real things, you know?

552
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can see that.

553
00:28:57,041 --> 00:29:00,100
Speaker 1: Like like, whereas in adventure time we'll be like, man, it should be like nuts.

554
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:07,780
Speaker 0: I don't know if I like the, like put a weird sentence at the bottom of every panel.

555
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,380
Speaker 0: So it feels like a web comic when you do that.

556
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,098
Speaker 0: That is the text.

557
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,720
Speaker 1: The dude is a webcomic author.

558
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:14,260
Speaker 0: In the hover over on a webcomic.

559
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,639
Speaker 1: The dude is a webcomic author.

560
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:16,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

561
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,820
Speaker 0: So I guess he's used to doing that.

562
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,260
Speaker 1: And the thing is, it would be totally cool, but some of them aren't funny.

563
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,600
Speaker 1: They just don't really add and let you know, it's like, it's like a cool Easter egg.

564
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,597
Speaker 1: The fact that it's there.

565
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:34,340
Speaker 1: So I in the meta sense, but the actual content of the words written down there usually don't add to what you just read.

566
00:29:34,682 --> 00:29:38,518
Speaker 1: And actually the kind of distracting cause like you're usually, I can read a comic book really fast.

567
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,260
Speaker 1: Just going through the bubbles and the pictures.

568
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,260
Speaker 0: Ah, young Padawan learned for the master.

569
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,000
Speaker 0: I read the comic first and I went back and read all those stupid things separately.

570
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:50,360
Speaker 0: And then I read all the non comic, the letter pages.

571
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:50,652
Speaker 1: Yeah.

572
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:51,139
Speaker 1: Yeah.

573
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,680
Speaker 1: So it's like they're doing everything that old comics did.

574
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:59,739
Speaker 1: You know, a lot of comics have letter pages even nowadays, but they don't put the letter pages in trades.

575
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,580
Speaker 1: They usually only put the letter page in the floppy issues.

576
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:02,830
Speaker 0: No.

577
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,280
Speaker 0: As a kid, I hated the letter pages.

578
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,840
Speaker 0: The letter page was, ah, the comic ended.

579
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,960
Speaker 0: I only got like four pages of comic and I got this ad and a letter page.

580
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:10,276
Speaker 0: Great.

581
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,980
Speaker 1: Letter pages are good, positive and negative points.

582
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:15,420
Speaker 1: Right.

583
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,940
Speaker 1: And you know, some of the letter page stuff in here is good and some of it's not so good.

584
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,766
Speaker 1: You know, it's when they can do.

585
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:25,800
Speaker 1: a funny answer is when it's good and I feel like they're printing too many of the letters.

586
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,459
Speaker 1: I feel like they should print less of them.

587
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:29,198
Speaker 0: Or just a hundred percent fake them.

588
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:31,160
Speaker 0: I don't know if they're fake.

589
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:31,640
Speaker 0: Are they real?

590
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,519
Speaker 1: Uh, I mean, as far as I can tell, they're, they're, they're probably real, right?

591
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:44,299
Speaker 1: I don't know if they, they've always been real throughout history, but letter pages are definitely mostly, if not completely real.

592
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:50,319
Speaker 1: Uh, so anyway, so yeah, it's a, what else is there to say about it?

593
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,418
Speaker 0: I mean, I liked it.

594
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,017
Speaker 1: It's hot.

595
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,720
Speaker 1: If you want to read a superhero comic, that's also quite humorous, but has a modern sensibility.

596
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:12,416
Speaker 0: I guess if you've never read the weird old nineties, like kind of gross quote unquote edgy comics or read them, you can read the score girl trade because I was moderately entertained by it.

597
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:16,480
Speaker 0: No, the thing is what it really struggled to finish.

598
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,759
Speaker 1: It just, it felt like a chore.

599
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,480
Speaker 0: Just what it really put into stark contrast.

600
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,278
Speaker 0: Get it?

601
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:28,640
Speaker 0: Stark Tony Stark is how unfunny Deadpool is except in the smallest of doses.

602
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:39,739
Speaker 0: So Deadpool is pretty great if you get like one to three pages of Deadpool inside of something else, but just Deadpool, how could you?

603
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,196
Speaker 1: So here's the thing, right?

604
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,360
Speaker 1: It's like Deadpool himself is not funny or unfunny, right?

605
00:31:45,440 --> 00:32:01,800
Speaker 1: Is that when you have superhero comics, there's so many different writers out there and even though it's the same nominally still Deadpool, the Deadpool in the first Deadpool comic and the Deadpool in a different Deadpool comic written by someone else are basically completely different characters, right?

606
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,800
Speaker 1: They have nothing to do with each other.

607
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:09,258
Speaker 1: So if you read like, you know, the very first Deadpool, it's like he's actually way serious and not a joke.

608
00:32:10,201 --> 00:32:14,380
Speaker 1: And if you read a Deadpool written by like Dan Slott, who's really hilarious.

609
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,140
Speaker 1: I don't know if he's ever written any Deadpools, but he's like way hilarious.

610
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,240
Speaker 1: It would probably be way hilarious.

611
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:25,140
Speaker 1: Like if you read, there's a comic from the early two thousands, like Cable and Deadpool, that comic is way funny.

612
00:32:26,023 --> 00:32:28,536
Speaker 1: At least it was way funny for a high school college brain of me.

613
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:34,699
Speaker 0: Well, cause there was a weird mystique around cable when I was in like middle school.

614
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:39,131
Speaker 1: Right.

615
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,919
Speaker 1: It's called Scott brain.

616
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:48,220
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's still funny, but I've read a lot of Deadpool comics that are just crappy toilet humor and aren't funny at all and has nothing to do with the character himself.

617
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,500
Speaker 1: It has to do with the author, right?

618
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:51,200
Speaker 1: It's the same with anything.

619
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,332
Speaker 1: Right?

620
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,460
Speaker 0: If you read some, you know, even like look at my little pony, like look at who wrote each episode and you got a good sense how that episode is going to go, right?

621
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,459
Speaker 1: So the squirrel girl that's written by Ryan North is the top tier squirrel girl.

622
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:08,560
Speaker 1: And you know, if it's written by someone else, yep.

623
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,191
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.

624

Speaker 0: You think you're all that Kim possible, but you're not.

633

Speaker 0: Matthew Smith, Don Schleich, Jar, Thomas and Joshua, Joe Starr, Tyler Eller, Sean Yeager, Sam quarter Clinton, Walton run from New Zealand.

635
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:43,989
Speaker 2: I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy.

636
00:34:46,429 --> 00:35:04,130
Speaker 2: I urge every member of both parties, Americans of all religions and of all colors, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause.

637
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:22,160
Speaker 2: At times, history and fate meet at a single time, in a single place, to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.

638
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:35,500
Speaker 2: So it was at Lexington and Concord, so it was a century ago at Appomattox, so it was just last week in Selma, Alabama.

639
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:47,460
Speaker 2: There, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans.

640
00:35:49,602 --> 00:35:51,880
Speaker 2: Many were brutally assaulted.

641
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:58,960
Speaker 2: One good man, a man of God, was killed.

642
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:06,780
Speaker 2: There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma.

643
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:17,559
Speaker 2: There is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans.

644
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:25,495
Speaker 2: But there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy.

645
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:28,819
Speaker 2: and what is happening here tonight.

646
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:49,600
Speaker 2: For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government, the government of the greatest nation on earth.

647
00:36:51,282 --> 00:37:04,540
Speaker 2: Our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country--to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man.

648
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:10,660
Speaker 2: In our time we have come to live with the moments of great crisis.

649
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:21,258
Speaker 2: Our lives have been marked with debate about great issues--issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and depression.

650
00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:32,140
Speaker 2: But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself.

651
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:51,377
Speaker 2: Rarely are we met with a challenge--not to our growth or abundance or our welfare or our security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation.

652
00:37:53,361 --> 00:38:00,440
Speaker 2: The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue.

653
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:20,440
Speaker 2: And should we defeat every enemy, and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation.

654
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:27,900
Speaker 2: For with a country as with a person, what is a man profiting?

655
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:35,300
Speaker 2: If he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul.
