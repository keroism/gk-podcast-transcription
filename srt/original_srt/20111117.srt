Speaker 2: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:30,820
Speaker 1: I guess we're back to kind of our normal schedule.

6
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:33,911
Speaker 2: I know it's bullshit because next week is gonna be Thanksgiving.

Speaker 1: We can do it.

9
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:39,100
Speaker 2: I'm just saying there's gonna be some mad holidays.

10
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:44,119
Speaker 1: I will manage unless I get sent to Turkey and then there's gonna be no geek nights for a while.

11
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:48,320
Speaker 2: well And then right so I'm off work from Christmas through mag fest.

12
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:52,798
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, so I go into work until after mag fest once.

13
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:55,313
Speaker 1: so Scott What are you going to do in that time?

14
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:56,419
Speaker 2: shit talk?

15
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:03,279
Speaker 2: Perhaps some of it will actually be shit, but most of it talk.

16
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:07,092
Speaker 2: Yeah, read a lot of comic books play some other Zelda game.

17
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:09,640
Speaker 2: all we'll have by then got a Gundam model.

18
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:12,208
Speaker 1: So much like we'll save it.

19
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:14,760
Speaker 2: maybe I'll write a line of code or something.

20
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,974
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for Tuesday to talk about burning apocalypse con, but it was pretty fun.

21
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:19,495
Speaker 1: It was okay.

22
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:20,699
Speaker 1: It's only okay.

23
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,310
Speaker 2: I mean it wasn't like packs, but no one was.

24
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:24,476
Speaker 2: you know no one's saying it was.

25
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:25,460
Speaker 2: it was a completely different thing.

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,820
Speaker 1: I was in some pretty good games But the people who played in my game.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,912
Speaker 2: I was in an excellent day game.

28
00:01:29,992 --> 00:01:33,131
Speaker 1: all the game that I got bumped out of that I wanted to be as he was the best.

29
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:34,700
Speaker 2: you should have joined the horde.

30
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:38,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did join and I got bumped by someone who may have looked like you.

31
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:41,880
Speaker 0: It was me with my number one priority.

32
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:51,723
Speaker 1: Meanwhile in the first slot I actually had second priority But a table of people lied to me and said I had fourth and because I didn't have the schedule on me I didn't check.

33
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:54,713
Speaker 2: I actually printed the schedule beforehand.

34
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:55,957
Speaker 2: I went before going.

35
00:01:56,137 --> 00:02:02,373
Speaker 2: I printed my own copy And I wrote on it my priorities for each Slot and I put checkmarks.

36
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:03,660
Speaker 2: and this is the games that look good.

37
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:04,645
Speaker 1: You know why I didn't do that?

38
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:10,654
Speaker 1: because the entire night before I was writing the game I was running and burning characters for it a free market.

39
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:15,560
Speaker 1: you require no writing Ah, but it was worth it because uh one of the players in my game.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,245
Speaker 1: So it was the best game.

41
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:16,849
Speaker 1: They played all week.

42
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,574
Speaker 1: It probably was one of the better games Yeah And I was very happy that I turned a ton of people away from that game like it did.

43
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:25,680
Speaker 1: the priorities went way up way quick.

44
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:35,080
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm The secret was I stole the entire game from Hyperion and the Prince of Nothing Steal from the Forgotten Masters, I started the game.

45
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:35,935
Speaker 2: I'm like he's told by.

46
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:37,792
Speaker 1: I Start the game like before.

47
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:39,162
Speaker 1: it started like there's small talk And I'm like.

48
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:44,267
Speaker 1: so if any of you ever read our Scott backers Prince of Nothing series and none of them had I was like Hey, you know who our Scott backer is?

49
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:44,791
Speaker 1: none of them did.

50
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:45,857
Speaker 1: I was like all right?

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,352
Speaker 1: And if you ever read Dan Simmons Hyperion none of them had.

52
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:51,160
Speaker 2: and I was like all right doesn't even heard of it.

53
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,112
Speaker 1: Uh actually I don't know.

54
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:53,577
Speaker 1: I didn't ask that.

55
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:56,126
Speaker 2: okay All right, that's it.

56
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:04,140
Speaker 1: Uh one more important thing because I was reminded of because the Prince of Nothing Kellis Nair thing, but we played a support games last night.

57
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:05,936
Speaker 1: We played Puerto Rico first time in a long time.

58
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,624
Speaker 1: yep Scott knows better.

59
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:10,209
Speaker 1: you should know better.

60
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:17,505
Speaker 1: yet somehow I tricked him with my simplest and dumbest trick of Acting all petulant.

61
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:21,139
Speaker 2: so that makes that we would both call Apple when you were ahead yep.

62
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:22,892
Speaker 1: So I was doing.

63
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:23,760
Speaker 1: I was doing pretty well.

64
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:28,598
Speaker 2: The only reason I went along with it is because Richard got the second ten building which convinced me.

65
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:37,980
Speaker 2: ah But I knew it wouldn't be enough to push him over the edge and the only difference between me and you Was that I didn't have the late-game doubloons to buy that one building.

66
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:40,080
Speaker 2: It was pretty much the one building between the two of us.

67
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:45,605
Speaker 2: I was actually ahead on the chips which is why I Cooperated because I said I'm ahead on the chips Scott I'm gonna stay ahead.

68
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,854
Speaker 1: if you thought you were you actually weren't.

69
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,746
Speaker 1: you forgot that I had two Unopposed captains early on.

70
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,994
Speaker 2: only the customs house is what put you over.

71
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:54,680
Speaker 2: if I had the customs house you would have lost.

72
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:56,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I had the customs house.

73
00:03:56,794 --> 00:04:02,780
Speaker 2: No shit No You didn't have the customs house when I started cooperating And I was pretty sure I was gonna get the customs house and I started going.

74
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,622
Speaker 2: Remember

75
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:18,039
Speaker 1: when we were talking about the big buildings right and I was like that's the building like I started suggesting to someone That you know an ex building and you interrupted and said that's the building rim needs buy it when in fact that was not the building I wanted or needed.

76
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,623
Speaker 2: It was.

77
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:29,006
Speaker 2: it was at the time it was but not no I mean at the time and I wasn't gonna tell and the other thing was I didn't want to tell them to buy the customs House because that's the one I wanted.

78
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:32,095
Speaker 1: but Scott I had more time you through the entire game.

79
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:33,580
Speaker 2: No, I had more victory chips.

80
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:34,266
Speaker 2: No, you did.

81
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:34,649
Speaker 2: I did.

82
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:40,246
Speaker 1: I had 37 points from those At the end of the game the chip.

83
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:41,672
Speaker 2: Yes, the victory point chips.

84
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,760
Speaker 1: I had 50 something at the end of the game.

85
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:46,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were almost the entire when you were going for that building.

86
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:49,280
Speaker 1: I had more Anyway anyway.

87
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:56,000
Speaker 1: but Hint for anyone ever plays a game with me if I suddenly start acting kind of pissy and anti-social.

88
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,180
Speaker 2: I do not cooperate with rim under any circumstance.

89
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:04,767
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh I can't win god damn it because chase bought a building that I really wanted and I used that opportunity To just sit there and be like fuck.

90
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:05,209
Speaker 1: I lost.

91
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:15,394
Speaker 2: and for whatever reason Scott believed it I Believed it only because Richard had 210 buildings and I believed I was gonna get the customs house Once you got the customs house, I started to worry but it was already over.

92
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:19,740
Speaker 1: I was worried that Emily Was gonna be like hey rims doing fine.

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,320
Speaker 2: No, I started to worry when the governor moved twice and I hadn't acquired in a single doubloon.

94
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:30,738
Speaker 2: That's when I started to worry because I said, oh, I'm not gonna be able to buy it fuck Yeah, and then it was over and it was too late.

95
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,753
Speaker 2: But before those two rounds passed I was still feeling pretty good.

96
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:37,142
Speaker 1: I remembered how much I fucking love that game though It's a good game.

97
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:38,025
Speaker 2: Yes game.

98
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:39,370
Speaker 1: All right, you got some news.

99
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:42,140
Speaker 2: I do so, you know the torchlight the Diablo clone.

100
00:05:42,502 --> 00:05:43,487
Speaker 2: Yeah, did you actually play that?

101
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,317
Speaker 1: Uh, no, but I know about it.

102
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,127
Speaker 2: All right Well, it's Diablo clone.

103
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:49,120
Speaker 2: I pretty much played it and then beat it and then it was done.

104
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,968
Speaker 1: It looks way more fun than the new Diablo.

105
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:57,058
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I looked at pecs West I saw a torchlight do and I talked to the guys and those guys.

106
00:05:57,179 --> 00:06:02,178
Speaker 2: well You know It's still at its core a game where you click and click and click and click and click and eventually win.

107
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:02,579
Speaker 2: and that's it.

108
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,172
Speaker 1: Attack attack attack potion attack attack potion attack town portal.

109
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:06,514
Speaker 2: Yep.

110
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:06,975
Speaker 2: That's it.

111
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:07,899
Speaker 2: There's nothing to it.

112
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:11,797
Speaker 2: Mindless clicking clicking on the monsters looking at flashy colors.

113
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:12,119
Speaker 2: That's it.

114
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:15,047
Speaker 2: But Every other aspect of this game.

115
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:16,411
Speaker 2: These guys are getting right.

116
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:17,113
Speaker 2: I talked to them.

117
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,060
Speaker 2: They're gonna have a flat price play forever.

118
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:21,648
Speaker 2: No DLCs another bull, you know stupid bullshit.

119
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:22,611
Speaker 2: That's unfair, right?

120
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,240
Speaker 2: No paying to get better characters, right?

121
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,660
Speaker 2: Awesome co-ops that will actually work unlike say magica, right?

122
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:32,848
Speaker 2: You know, basically everything awesome.

123
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,780
Speaker 2: they got everything right except for the fact that it's a game where all you do is click.

124
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:45,440
Speaker 2: torchlight 2 however sadly is gonna be delayed a Delayed from this year until some point in the near future.

125
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,357
Speaker 1: I want to take you back to a time the distant past When we were waiting for a game called tribes to to come out and it got delayed.

126
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:55,071
Speaker 1: Yep Nothing will ever compare to that feeling.

127
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:56,299
Speaker 2: I'm gonna call it right now.

128
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,780
Speaker 2: This will not become the next Duke Nukem forever because what I saw at PAX was so close to done.

129
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:09,277
Speaker 1: I think that they're just wait will not become the next game that comes out and people can buy After ten years.

130
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:14,293
Speaker 2: But yeah, actually the guy this is the funny part of this right.

131
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:15,497
Speaker 2: it's like okay game was delayed.

132
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:16,220
Speaker 2: what's the big deal?

00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:22,328
Speaker 2: the guy who announced, you know from the company who announced the delay He said quote.

135
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,920
Speaker 2: besides you're all playing Skyrim right now.

136
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,763
Speaker 2: Anyway, aren't you?

Speaker 2: No rush It'll take us this time next year to make our way through everything you just mentioned In some non gaming news, I just want to bring this up very briefly.

143
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:54,515
Speaker 1: It was kind of an open e sort of meta thing, but I can buy.

144
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:56,040
Speaker 1: Wall Street is all up in my business.

145
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,649
Speaker 1: They're like outside my building.

Speaker 1: Yeah From the 16th floor I can hear individual people talking on the ground floor like on the street.

152
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:30,037
Speaker 2: I'm on the seventh floor and I can only hear the following things from the street the tour bus with the microphone All right on the top, right?

153
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:37,299
Speaker 2: If a guy comes and starts busking with a sax or drumming or something like that I can hear it or a siren of some sort.

154
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:39,051
Speaker 2: I cannot hear anything else.

155
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:44,179
Speaker 1: in my old building in the Lincoln building I one time I was staying at work late for something and I heard a ruckus outside.

156
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,080
Speaker 1: So I opened the window and I see a cabbie chasing a guy around his cab.

157
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:53,410
Speaker 1: So I can hear the whole argument and it was really funny and I just kind of held my phone videoing the thing.

158
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,134
Speaker 1: in case you know It turned into YouTube and it didn't.

159
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,000
Speaker 1: they just ran around for a while.

160
00:08:57,201 --> 00:09:11,380
Speaker 2: I was walking down the street in Astoria some months ago And there was like a cabbie was gonna fight and a yellow cab was gonna fight with a non yellow cab and the two guys Were out and like one guy was getting ready to punch the other guy and the other guy was like respect yourself What are you doing?

161
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,270
Speaker 1: Respect that's that's a good thing to say right.

162
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,299
Speaker 2: and then it was just sort of like in.

163
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:18,605
Speaker 1: Thing.

164
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:19,571

Speaker 1: that's on one hand admonishment coupled with insight.

166
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:28,315
Speaker 1: You're inciting the person but yet at the same time the thing you were inciting them about.

167
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:29,800
Speaker 1: they'll feel worse if they act.

168
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:31,332
Speaker 2: Yeah, it wasn't.

169
00:09:31,393 --> 00:09:32,018
Speaker 2: I just kept walking.

170
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:41,015
Speaker 1: It wasn't Lately, I stopped whenever I see stuff except the only rare stuff because it's happening So constantly that it's like, oh look a whole bunch of riot police marching in formation.

171
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:41,698
Speaker 1: Cool.

Speaker 2: Oh We should buy riot police here on the internet and then show up and have two lines of real line of real riot Please in the line of fake rat police face because we keep talking about video games.

174
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,559
Speaker 1: So I played counter-strike one six few days ago.

175
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,938
Speaker 2: I keep meaning to do it, but then I end up just clicking on source and playing for real.

176
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:01,380
Speaker 1: It was fine.

177
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,250
Speaker 1: I was playing okay, and then I Realized as an item that I forgot about the riot shield.

178
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,878
Speaker 2: I thought they that was like in and out.

179
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:10,540
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't out.

180
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,764
Speaker 1: It's just we started playing source.

181
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:12,446
Speaker 2: I forgot.

182
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:13,008
Speaker 2: they added it.

183
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:16,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what that thing is unfair fucking hacks broken.

184
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:17,829
Speaker 1: It is awesome.

185
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,799
Speaker 2: How broken could it be?

186
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:23,200
Speaker 1: I was invincible God with that thing if I was gonna base, but it doesn't stop bullets.

187
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:25,899
Speaker 2: How many bullets does it stop all of them?

188
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:27,078
Speaker 2: What if someone shoots you in the back?

189
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,232
Speaker 1: You back up into a corner put it in new front of yourself and duck.

190
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:35,864
Speaker 1: if you have three people doing that in each bombsite The bombsite is pretty big.

191
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:36,505
Speaker 1: Yeah.

192
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:39,032
Speaker 2: Did you have the bomb behind you in a corner next to a crate?

193
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:40,777
Speaker 1: We were counter terrorists.

194
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:44,920
Speaker 2: Oh So you can you shoot from around behind the shield.

195
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:49,880
Speaker 1: Uh, you can put it to the side and then it'll protect you halfway and then you can shoot but then you can be shot.

196
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:53,275
Speaker 1: ah Interesting you'll play and you'll see it's it's fun.

197
00:10:53,295 --> 00:11:09,380
Speaker 1: Okay So things of the day in the course of our game night Of course all social gatherings at the geek house unless we specifically prevent it turn into everybody show a YouTube video before we go to bed.

198
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:24,353
Speaker 1: So we were talking about adaptive Like picture stuff like adaptive scaling, you know the stuff where you like take a picture and you make it wider and it figures out more scenario or more scenery to put like in between the edges dynamically stuff like that.

199
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:32,820
Speaker 1: and The discussion went to how like a lot of techno music uses what is effectively a compressor set up wrong to make like cool effects.

200
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:39,373
Speaker 2: So the debate was like you have a tool with an intended purpose But then you somehow use the tool in a way that it was not intended.

201
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:43,086
Speaker 2: right like a saw is meant to cut wood But it can also be an instrument.

202
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:46,620
Speaker 2: right exactly, you know, it's like you're not using the saw, right?

203
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,079
Speaker 2: But I'm still making something cool.

204
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:49,950
Speaker 1: So we start.

205
00:11:49,991 --> 00:12:00,220
Speaker 1: I started positing Why doesn't someone Do the same thing with video like set up like what if you set up a codec like really wrong to do an interesting thing?

206
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:06,320
Speaker 1: And a friend chase Gordon who was an awesome listener and friend and member of our New York City hangout crew.

207
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,280
Speaker 1: Now you might remember him from such classics as the old Rochester whiskey.

208
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,774
Speaker 2: Raymond Scott's old Rochester whiskey immediately turned that particular comics.

209
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:30,418
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a thing Datamosh young Jake did a rap did a song and when he has a music video associated with it which is my thing of the day, which is him doing exactly what I suggested and It's actually pretty cool.

210
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, I dig this.

211
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:34,324
Speaker 1: Lyrics are also funny.

212
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:34,806
Speaker 1: They're funny.

213
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:37,956
Speaker 1: in the same way then, you know sit like fuck.

214
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:39,942

00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:43,191
Speaker 1: Look at my shit.

217
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:46,300
Speaker 1: I'm doing this on purpose doing this on purpose.

218
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,214
Speaker 2: So I found the best tumblr best tumblr magic cards with googly eyes.

219
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,020
Speaker 2: The guy takes magic the gathering cards.

220
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:58,380
Speaker 2: He figures out the exact best googly eyes to put on them in the exact right places.

221
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,460
Speaker 2: He even gets the black dots in the googly eyes in the best possible position on the magic card.

222
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,560
Speaker 2: Googly eyes are generally pretty useful and he just just putting you just puts googly eyes in the magic card and they become hilarious.

223
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:12,040
Speaker 2: My favorite is this one the Vodalian serpent.

224
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:13,995
Speaker 2: That's pretty great Right.

225
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,000
Speaker 2: There's also some clever ones.

226
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,626
Speaker 2: So there's like a spider and as a fuck ton of eyes or a card There's like a whole bunch of creatures.

227
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:25,848
Speaker 2: So there's a whole bunch of eyes and all of them or this one That's like a lumber knot.

228
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,760
Speaker 2: It's got two eyes and two weird-ass places.

229
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:30,405
Speaker 2: I'm sure there's like some Cyclops is around.

230
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:31,608
Speaker 1: I just noticed the back of the car.

231
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:32,290
Speaker 1: That's pretty good, too.

232
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:39,239
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah His background on the blog is a magic card with five googly eyes where the five colored dots normally would be.

233
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:40,083
Speaker 1: It's funny.

234
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:46,100
Speaker 1: every now and then I get this weird urge to play magic kind of like how I imagine ex-smokers Occasionally get a weird urge to smoke a cigarette.

235
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,620
Speaker 1: Yeah We thought I should play magic and then I remember how much I hate magic.

236
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:55,060
Speaker 2: We can just go to a gaming store and we could buy two starter decks for like almost nothing and just play whatever you get.

237
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:56,109
Speaker 1: Suck now though.

238
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,340
Speaker 2: I know but that's what I'm saying.

239
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,601
Speaker 2: We just.

240
00:13:57,883 --> 00:14:01,810
Speaker 2: but the thing is the ones we get at packs for free are yeah ass Those are like babies.

241
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:02,680
Speaker 1: first magic, right?

242
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:08,700
Speaker 2: We should get the ones just two real ones from some set that's identical and just whatever you why don't we just take all of?

243
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,286
Speaker 1: Magic cards that we own?

244
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:12,935
Speaker 1: because I play with those because they are not equal.

245
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:13,678
Speaker 1: who gives a shit?

246
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:14,139
Speaker 2: just do it.

247
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:14,751
Speaker 2: We could do.

248
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,798
Speaker 2: well, you know We could do is you could try that mode where there's like one giant deck or something like that.

249
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:20,163
Speaker 2: Right?

250
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:23,555
Speaker 2: wasn't there a mode where there's a giant deck and there's five stacks of open-faced land?

251
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:24,398
Speaker 1: a better way to play?

252
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,020
Speaker 1: is that the star?

253
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,520
Speaker 1: Mode that nobody plays anymore where everyone plays a one color deck one of each color.

254
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,197
Speaker 1: Oh you win if you beat the two people across from you.

255
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:33,507
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.

256
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:34,434
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a good mode.

257
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:34,958
Speaker 2: I'll be white.

258
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:43,140
Speaker 1: You could be white All right, so I don't know what happened but we just keep having guests on geek nights.

259
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:46,020
Speaker 0: Yes, so making your life cuz you got no show ideas.

260
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:46,559
Speaker 2: You know what?

261
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:54,370
Speaker 1: It is no longer difficult to have guests on the show because remember the last time we used to have guests I had that Non awesome sound card and I couldn't like multi-track.

262
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,059
Speaker 2: Well now you got all those little tiny sound USB external guys.

263
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:58,288
Speaker 1: Uh, no, I don't use.

264
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:59,820
Speaker 2: All right, you get the firewire interface.

265
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:02,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know how many people we can have on geek nights with no trouble.

266
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:08,072
Speaker 1: 100 And That's if I don't use my multiplexer.

267
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:10,041
Speaker 1: then we can go up to 20.

268
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,615
Speaker 1: But at that point I might have some hardware problems in terms of my.

269
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:16,300
Speaker 2: we have that many inputs on the mixer.

270
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:18,289
Speaker 1: No, I'd have to multiplex.

271
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:18,792
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

272
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:19,316
Speaker 2: Okay.

273
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:32,589
Speaker 0: Yes So the reason I'm on the show today instead of just sitting in the corner and laughing at those guys is because those guys those guys Those little guys You're jaded to us a little bit.

274
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:42,380
Speaker 1: because when Jared was those guys It was difficult to record because Jared was laughing so hard that like he couldn't even like look at the mic Like he did go away from the microphone and start laughing like hysterically.

275
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:46,440
Speaker 0: It's funny cuz I I guess I'm kind of a nerd to it now.

276
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,008
Speaker 0: But it's like when I see other people react to you.

277
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:55,294
Speaker 0: then it comes back to me how hilarious it actually is, you know So, um, but yeah, I had the.

278
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:56,580
Speaker 0: we figured it's Thursday.

279
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:12,960
Speaker 0: So everything is just kind of whatever topic we want to talk about and I figured since it was rims first trip to Japan it might be kind of cool to Talk about that a little bit and how Scott asked questions like you don't want me to ask questions.

280
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:14,004
Speaker 0: No, I said you

281
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:14,767
Speaker 1: said we do want

Speaker 2: Did you see zero?

286
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,015
Speaker 0: the whole panty vending machine thing is a myth.

287
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:23,179
Speaker 2: how many?

291
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:44,884

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:06,112
Speaker 1: Yeah No, no, not the maid cafe, oh you're though That was a pretty great place my favorite guy I got to hang out with.

298
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:06,614
Speaker 0: pump.

299
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,358
Speaker 0: pump pump is awesome.

300
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,550
Speaker 0: So I I prefer them over.

301
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:14,560
Speaker 0: be she be she looking guys.

302
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:18,269
Speaker 1: So, yeah, if you guys couldn't tell you know Emily and I went to Japan for a couple goes

303
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:30,323
Speaker 2: to be The love hotel Castle theme

304
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:37,960
Speaker 0: well near where we were staying in Kyoto that there was this hotel and it was obviously a love hotel You can tell because the facade

305
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,584
Speaker 1: People

306
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:46,720
Speaker 0: go in and they always list, you know two prices There's the rest and then there's the stay which is overnight, you know.

307
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:52,049
Speaker 0: So rest is like a few hours and so that's when you want to have a quickie or something.

308
00:17:52,069 --> 00:18:09,539
Speaker 0: you go to the love hotel and pay like 30 bucks and you Can have a couple hours in a in a fantasy themed room, but this hotel was called hotel to you I get it which was like hotel and then that happened The best hotel I've ever seen.

309
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:24,970
Speaker 0: It's like when somebody's telling a story and it's kind of like you say that before you like Big lead-up to how these people ended up.

310
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,780
Speaker 0: So I thought that was pretty hilarious.

311
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:39,655
Speaker 1: I guess if we kind of go chronologically the first thing I have to say is that I've determined Scientifically that jet lag is a motherfucking myth.

312
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:48,103
Speaker 2: There's no such thing Jet lag and people always complain about it, but I'd like go whole Like.

313
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:48,927
Speaker 1: you're gonna.

314
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:50,775
Speaker 1: you know jet lag you're gonna experience it.

315
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:51,880
Speaker 1: It's gonna really mess you up.

316
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,925
Speaker 1: You gotta be ready for this.

317
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:55,680
Speaker 1: I get to Japan and I'm just like fine.

318
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,959
Speaker 0: So when we were at PAX, right, it's Seattle is what three hours different for.

319
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:08,080
Speaker 0: So When we flew over it was like, you know, I get tired a little early in the evening.

320
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:13,708
Speaker 0: So it's like it hits 10 o'clock at night and I'm like guys I gotta go to bed, you know They're like, oh you big wuss baby.

321
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:15,135
Speaker 0: Come on play more games.

322
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:19,632
Speaker 0: I'm like, no seriously I'm tired, you know jet lag and they're like whatever chat like.

323
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,040
Speaker 0: and rim says I don't have jet lag at all.

324
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,146
Speaker 0: I never get jet lag.

325
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,860
Speaker 0: and I'm like well wait until you have a major time shift.

326
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:37,459
Speaker 0: And so I was waiting to get my revenge because here we have an international flight which is basically what 13 13 or 14 hours depending on whether it's daylight savings time.

327
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:55,960
Speaker 0: and So I was like your day will become night and you'll see the pain and then you will be sick and not want to eat anything because actually I get less sleepy and more like I'm hungry at weird times and not hungry when I'm supposed to eat like I Really sick to my stomach cuz my body is like you're not supposed to be eating.

328
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:02,964
Speaker 2: I think I'm starting to agree with rim because like when I was Israel, I didn't have any problems and when I went to Seattle I've never had any problems.

329
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:09,800
Speaker 1: I think that he is the build-up like I'd basically stayed up before But so then I slept on the plane and that was my night sleep.

330
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,890
Speaker 1: So I woke up in Japan at like 11 a.m.

331
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:18,569
Speaker 1: Or something had a whole day and then like 930 10 o'clock I went to bed and I was fine.

332
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:19,493
Speaker 1: I was just like on normal time.

333
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:24,332
Speaker 1: In fact, I slept better in Japan Slept in like the last decade.

334
00:20:24,392 --> 00:20:27,951
Speaker 2: special beds there some shit Different kind of mattresses.

335
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:28,776
Speaker 1: Yeah futon.

336
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,186
Speaker 0: All right Most of the time we slept on the floor.

337
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:38,216
Speaker 0: actually because most of the the hotels we stayed at were traditional broken And so it's just like three mats.

338
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:45,640
Speaker 0: and yeah It was like we had tatami mats and then just pulled out the the futons from the closet and slept on those.

339
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:46,929
Speaker 1: They were really nice rooms.

340
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:48,198
Speaker 2: They have internet in those rooms.

341
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,240
Speaker 1: Interestingly a few of them did but I noticed because you know, I didn't have a data plan.

342
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:55,213
Speaker 1: I was tracking like GPS coordinates of walking around.

343
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:59,660
Speaker 1: There's basically Pretty much zero free Wi-Fi anywhere in Japan.

344
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:09,658
Speaker 1: There's a million locked Wi-Fi's and Wi-Fi's you can log into and pay money to get internet But there's no free ones.

345
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:18,774
Speaker 0: There were a few like the one in the shopping district in Kyoto like Google or Yahoo or someone isn't providing no First Man, I tell you though.

346
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:20,442
Speaker 0: I hated my cell phone I rented.

347
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:24,715
Speaker 0: I rented from a US company and it was like this crappy Nokia phone that would.

348
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:33,800
Speaker 0: the screen would stay on it would Run out of battery in a few hours And I hadn't realized how much I depend on a smartphone because there were so many times where we'd be walking around.

349
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,090
Speaker 0: I'd be like Google Maps.

350
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:39,432
Speaker 2: Oh, no, Google Just paid whatever it cost to get a real phone.

351
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,060
Speaker 0: That's I think I'm gonna do it next time.

352
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,000
Speaker 0: I'm like just get it from a tree Like the next iPhones.

353
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw that there were.

354
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:50,340
Speaker 0: actually a lot of the phones are starting to use the global standard.

355
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:53,360
Speaker 2: Well, it's just they have all they have, you know, both sets of radios.

356
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's like the old days like my pre my old cell phone way back had it could do analog and two different Digital formats.

357
00:22:00,425 --> 00:22:04,439
Speaker 2: It's just a fistful of radios in there and then you could turn on only the ones you're using right now.

358
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:12,660
Speaker 1: but interestingly I did learn that a Smartphone that has good GPS and a magnetic compass but does not have any data whatsoever It's still.

359
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:22,372
Speaker 1: Do you mean what was I gonna do?

360
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:23,416
Speaker 2: not free Wi-Fi's?

361
00:22:23,597 --> 00:22:38,381
Speaker 1: yeah But basically I was I could use the cache Google Maps and the GPS stuff And if I started a track like when we're going somewhere like we rented bikes in Nagoya for a day I was actually pretty good, you know, it was clown bikes Like.

362
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:42,675
Speaker 0: actually they were some of the better rental bikes because they were actual mountain bikes.

363
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,946
Speaker 0: the frame was okay for me But quite small.

364
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,780
Speaker 1: I would look like I was riding a clown.

365
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:50,170
Speaker 0: It wasn't as bad as the tourist bike rental.

366
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:53,480
Speaker 2: No, but they're meant for tiny Japanese people, right?

367
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,800
Speaker 0: Japanese people were riding frames that were way too.

368
00:22:57,601 --> 00:22:59,311
Speaker 1: So here's the weird thing about bikes that I noticed.

369
00:22:59,451 --> 00:23:01,020
Speaker 0: one two thirds of the people.

370
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:04,180
Speaker 1: Yes, so two-thirds of the people like bikes are everywhere.

371
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:08,676
Speaker 1: But there's no such thing as biking on the left or right or on the street or the sidewalk.

372
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:09,880
Speaker 1: people just bike fucking everywhere.

373
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:17,380
Speaker 1: So the sidewalks just have people careening in expertly around barely missing everybody and like wobble wobble on the sidewalk.

374
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,533
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's actually getting to be a problem.

375
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:21,567
Speaker 0: Like I was talking with Mr.

376
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:31,870
Speaker 0: Noda and he was saying that They're starting to be laws looked into because there are so many pedestrian and bicycle accidents I can tell you why nobody knows how to ride their bike.

377
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:33,055
Speaker 0: It isn't car and bike.

378
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:34,059
Speaker 0: It's a pedestrian.

379
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:39,896
Speaker 1: and bike Yeah Is the main cause of the bikes go really really slow and they wobble all over the place on the sidewalk.

380
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:55,608
Speaker 0: and also it's weird Because like in New York, it seems like the people who bike are either one delivery guys who have the really tough-looking BMX bikes You know, they're like really chunky frames and stuff or the like Hipster style like fixie whatever But it's popular in hip.

381
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,480
Speaker 0: it's mostly like what do they call mama Charlie's.

382
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:05,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, mama Charlie's and the mama Charlie's are like these single gear fixed, you know fixed gear bicycle.

383
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,027
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way Scott.

384
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:13,322
Speaker 1: Our average New York walking speed is faster than the average Cuz.

385
00:24:13,523 --> 00:24:14,768
Speaker 0: think of how far we got.

386
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,157
Speaker 0: of course we had mountain bikes, but we were also.

387
00:24:17,218 --> 00:24:17,800
Speaker 1: we were booking.

388
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,182
Speaker 1: I mean we.

389
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:19,528
Speaker 1: I mean any biker we came to.

390
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:20,512
Speaker 1: we just blew by it.

391
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:23,900
Speaker 0: was it was actually funny because We were riding around?

392
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,909
Speaker 0: No, actually actually the one time we got Called out to we were riding around campus.

393
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:44,879
Speaker 0: We were at Nagoya University and we're riding around campus and this one Group of kids was just like yo cool bikes, you know, and they were yelling Small but I was like the rentals and they're like, oh they're still cool.

394
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:46,909
Speaker 1: Almost no one had like mountain bikes.

395
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,020
Speaker 1: But yeah the other third like there were bikers.

396
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,959
Speaker 1: There was a very tiny minority of what if you had actually cool bikes?

397
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:54,163
Speaker 1: then Here's the deal.

398
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:55,952
Speaker 1: The majority of people are riding crap bikes.

399
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:57,480
Speaker 1: They don't really know how to ride them.

400
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,505
Speaker 1: They're going very slow and wobbly.

401
00:24:58,525 --> 00:24:59,249
Speaker 1: They're on the sidewalk.

402
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:04,111
Speaker 1: a small minority are on bikes like ours Going wicked fast with the traffic in the street.

403
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:06,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're like two completely separate classes.

404
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,030
Speaker 2: I've seen initial D action on the street.

405
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:12,611
Speaker 2: I saw a lot of rice cars All right, any cars that like do not exist using the GTRs.

406
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:13,253
Speaker 2: and actually

407
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:14,497
Speaker 1: yes when we were

408
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:20,478
Speaker 0: cars Mm-hmm, like yeah boxy square cars because it's hard to park so a lot of they're

409
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:21,483
Speaker 2: all tiny could you

410
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:32,391
Speaker 0: really tall but really like Short, you know, so they're like this cube shape kind of cars instead of the more aerodynamic Aerofoil curves that we tend to.

411
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:39,840
Speaker 1: but I did see two GTRs parked in the notice neighborhood and I saw another GTR when we were in Kyoto parked out in a fancy neighborhood.

412
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,568
Speaker 1: Cool a lot of GTRs.

413
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:42,393
Speaker 0: I didn't notice.

414
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:45,167
Speaker 1: but well GTR I noticed it's one of those.

415
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:49,516
Speaker 1: it's one of the few cars that other than the Miata that I'm just Might have stolen it.

416
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:56,500
Speaker 1: They're kind of nondescript compared to like a Lamborghini.

417
00:25:59,377 --> 00:26:04,580
Speaker 0: But So yeah riding bikes was actually one of those ideas where it was rims idea.

418
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:15,550
Speaker 0: So let's rent bikes when we get to Nagoya because we hadn't really done a lot of exercise We walked around a lot, but we hadn't like run or Yeah crazy.

419
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:21,499
Speaker 0: and so Because rim doesn't really speak much of the language a lot of the trip planning kind of falls on me.

420
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:27,000
Speaker 0: And so I was like, okay, so if we're gonna rent bikes, I have to arrange the renting of the bikes.

421
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:29,456
Speaker 0: So we stopped for an hour at a net cafe.

422
00:26:29,577 --> 00:26:35,968
Speaker 0: Oh my god I thought he was gonna love the net cafe.

423
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:37,494
Speaker 1: Talk about a den of iniquity.

424
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:49,376
Speaker 0: No, it's like this huge Library of manga like there are shells and shelves of manga and free drinks and these little box cubicles and more cigarette smoke that I've been exposed to in the rest of my life.

425
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:53,327
Speaker 1: come on, I Was getting like nauseous.

426
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:55,900
Speaker 2: I couldn't have gone in like I would have gone out immediately.

427
00:26:57,201 --> 00:27:01,676
Speaker 1: It's funny because people like smoking is okay in Japan for the most part like people smoke all over plays.

428
00:27:01,696 --> 00:27:05,037
Speaker 0: but but you saw in Nagoya, they have anti-smoking signs in certain.

429
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:06,687
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah What I was gonna get to is that it didn't.

430
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,518
Speaker 1: I was surprised.

431
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:20,947
Speaker 1: actually I think the smoking rates are way less than they were not that long ago because in all the upper scale places they're really like no one was smoking and like the nicer the ocons like you weren't allowed to smoke in the room and You're not allowed to smoke on the street.

432
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,517
Speaker 1: Really you have to smoke in like smoking areas on the street.

433
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:24,120
Speaker 2: That's good.

434
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:25,765
Speaker 0: No smoking while walking.

435
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:32,529
Speaker 1: the only place about that occasionally like if you're at a cheaper like less great restaurant There'd be like someone smoking which really sucked.

436
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,580
Speaker 1: but whatever the nice restaurants known was smoking.

437
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:42,926
Speaker 1: but Whenever we went into a game center everybody's smoking Especially in the pachinko area.

438
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,932
Speaker 1: Oh my god go over to everyone.

439
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:45,614
Speaker 1: game center.

440
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:48,081
Speaker 1: There's like 40 pachinko parlors Mm-hmm.

441
00:27:48,422 --> 00:28:05,810
Speaker 0: pachinko is everywhere and it's really loud and the game centers usually have pachinko in them Like they'll be like, you know one-third video game machines and one like two-thirds pachinko and slot patchy slot and stuff like that, so The crane games are off the hook.

442
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,898
Speaker 1: There's like food in there.

443
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:11,426
Speaker 0: It's like ice cream.

444
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:14,240
Speaker 0: it's like a refrigerated crane game where you can grab ice.

445
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:20,220
Speaker 1: This gave me a dystopian vision of the future where the homeless are given tokens and there are food crane games in the street.

446
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:22,727
Speaker 0: That's really sick.

447
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:23,753
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could see it.

448
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:33,680
Speaker 0: They have all sorts of stuff like, you know, there's the traditional stuffed animals But there's also like anime figures and like it's kind of like a wild world.

449
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:46,169
Speaker 0: they'll have the machines where you can like get a PSP and stuff from the crane game, but I Arcades in Japan like I knew they're awesome, but actually being in one they are awesome But they're not as good as they used to be.

450
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:47,957
Speaker 2: but they're full of smoke like it's but it's.

451
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:48,660
Speaker 1: so here's the thing.

452
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:56,420
Speaker 1: They were full of smoke But all the smokers were either in the fighting game area, which is kind of separate or in the pachinko like crap area.

453
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:59,495
Speaker 1: So where all the good games were that weren't fighting games.

454
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:00,400
Speaker 1: there's really no smoke.

455
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,591
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think it was smoking and playing DDR right now.

456
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:03,877
Speaker 1: No, we did find a DDR machine.

457
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,128
Speaker 1: It was like yeah, it was only one.

458
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:08,620
Speaker 1: It was like 16th mix or something crazy.

459
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,603
Speaker 1: It was all like that.

460
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:11,288
Speaker 1: It was all like deaf punk songs.

461
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:13,153
Speaker 0: We did gorillas.

462
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:15,240
Speaker 0: We did feel-good ink and we did.

463
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,647
Speaker 2: Let me see how many DDS got like.

464
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,534
Speaker 1: the foot system is completely different now.

465
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:20,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was like this song is 16 feet.

466
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,223
Speaker 1: What does that mean?

467
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:24,071
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm gonna look up.

468
00:29:24,252 --> 00:29:24,855
Speaker 0: so we were.

469
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,060
Speaker 0: we were like exhausted.

470
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,501
Speaker 0: Those are.

471
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:37,556
Speaker 1: we played tanks tanks tanks and initial D not for not five Mario, but six Initial d6 with a full-size steering wheel and Mario Kart 2 which was actually really awesome.

472
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was really fun.

473
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:50,460
Speaker 0: We went to game centers a couple of times like in Tokyo and then we went in Kyoto in Gion Before we went back to the hotel, but I think my favorite thing was watching you play the Gundam pod.

474
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,419
Speaker 1: Oh my god, the gun gun is a four.

475
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,340
Speaker 1: It's like you sit in a pipe.

476
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:01,887
Speaker 1: It's like the old a mech warrior belt that kind of things that were in the US that then disappeared but way more advanced and it's like a dollar to play too.

477
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:04,879
Speaker 1: and it the games like forever and it's just four on four people.

478
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:08,560
Speaker 1: and There's like there's voice chat and radio channels.

479
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,559
Speaker 1: So you can like chat with each other or like flip the broadcast and like chat with the enemy team.

480
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,000
Speaker 1: And the controls were like it looked like I was inside of a Gundam.

481
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,152
Speaker 1: I had all the controls of a Gundam and a million buttons and switches.

482
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:21,714
Speaker 2: and all these are.

483
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:27,152
Speaker 1: kids afford those pods Because there's tournaments in these things like every day as far as I can tell.

484
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:33,960
Speaker 0: think if you get people in there constantly There's like a steady stream of people those people at school.

485
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:36,749
Speaker 1: well Scott like imagine this imagine you and me.

486
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:44,698
Speaker 1: imagine if there was an arcade that a good computers and There was just a Counter-Strike League like the bowling league and we just like go there every other week.

487
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:46,460
Speaker 1: Yeah Counter-Strike.

488
00:30:47,444 --> 00:30:57,220
Speaker 0: I saw a thing where it was a soccer game, but it had like winning 11 Yeah, but it was like they had in one station for every player every player on the team.

489
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:09,889
Speaker 0: So you'd actually be in the room and play soccer Virtually with the people around you which kind of sounds funny to somebody who actually likes to play soccer in real life Because it's like why not just go play soccer.

490
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:18,260
Speaker 0: But the fact is you you have like these You know World Cup kind of matches virtually with all your friends sitting in the same room.

491
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,811
Speaker 2: So the newest DDR that came out in November of 2011 November 16th.

492
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:26,150
Speaker 2: So yesterday Yeah is dance dance revolution x3 verse second.

493
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:27,675
Speaker 1: Okay x2 is what we were playing.

494
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:29,460
Speaker 2: That was the set that was came out in July.

495
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:30,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

496
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:32,608
Speaker 1: So note on Pirate Bay.

497
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:33,954
Speaker 1: No one's even pirating that shit.

498
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:35,019
Speaker 0: so sad.

499
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:36,323
Speaker 0: DDR.

500
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:37,610
Speaker 0: DDR is really fun.

501
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:39,360
Speaker 0: It's a good way to keep fit in the winter.

502
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:42,740
Speaker 0: I've I've awakened to its its terms.

503
00:31:43,082 --> 00:31:49,029
Speaker 1: So we went to like all the day when we started in Tokyo and then we went to Nagoya And then we went to Hakone and then Kyoto.

504
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,498
Speaker 0: No, we went Hakone before.

505
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:52,922
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Yes It's.

506
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:59,219
Speaker 0: we went to Tokyo and then went to Ora Wada and took the little train over to Hakone and then we went.

507
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:14,087
Speaker 0: What one thing I must recommend and if you're gonna be in Japan for like a week or something or two weeks is Maybe and you're gonna be traveling around a lot and seeing a lot of different places Look into the rail pass because it

508
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:17,880
Speaker 1: was like a Galaxy Express style like just you show it to people.

509
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,280
Speaker 1: They're like, oh just step right through unlimited everything any any kind of train doesn't matter what any JR train.

510
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:28,489
Speaker 1: So all this all the Tokyo like stuff and the Shinkansen But not the Nozomi line and the buses.

511
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:30,536
Speaker 0: so you can go on highway buses once I can.

512
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:32,251
Speaker 2: even you can just take the bullet Trains all you want.

513
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:32,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

514
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's the Nozomi the kodama and the Hikari.

515
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,905
Speaker 2: So what are the other.

516
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:38,668
Speaker 2: what is the difference?

517
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:45,395
Speaker 2: the Nozomi is like the Krazy Express as far as I can tell Everywhere all the way to Japan.

518
00:32:45,415 --> 00:32:49,651
Speaker 0: Yes I believe it runs between.

519
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:51,175
Speaker 0: it's the Tokaido sense.

520
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:54,565
Speaker 0: So I think it runs between Tokyo and Kyoto.

521
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:59,057
Speaker 0: if I'm not mistaken, it might run further south, but there are.

522
00:32:59,198 --> 00:33:04,448
Speaker 0: there are a couple different Shinkansen lines all kind of branching from Tokyo.

523
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:07,175
Speaker 1: So our trains we have no excuse.

524
00:33:07,256 --> 00:33:10,427
Speaker 1: the the Shinkansen was Ridiculously fast.

525
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:14,424
Speaker 1: It's cheaper than Amtrak tickets Like.

526
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:16,579
Speaker 2: well people are using it constantly every day.

527
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:20,776
Speaker 1: It runs all the time and you know what to put it in perspective.

528
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:29,966
Speaker 1: if we had Shinkansen in America, which one to the rail gauge is narrower than our gauge, which is I think a big key to how it works well, it's because our main thing is.

529
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:35,804
Speaker 2: I've read a whole thing about how our rails because they're also had to be used for freight and Because they all right.

530
00:33:35,824 --> 00:33:36,989
Speaker 2: So that's why they're watching.

531
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:38,414
Speaker 1: consent takes less right-of-way.

532
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,789
Speaker 1: It's faster on the outside It's quieter than Amtrak trains.

533
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:55,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, despite being fast and If we had Shinkansen here With stops with many stops it would be About the same commuting from Albany to Manhattan every day than we had commuting from Beacon to Manhattan.

534
00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:58,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, Albany to Manhattan you could commute.

535
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:00,355
Speaker 1: we wouldn't be that bad.

536
00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:03,509
Speaker 0: We were going what like 250.

537
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:14,679
Speaker 1: yeah Fast as a plane the average speed you can get to Florida in two or three hours the average speed Including many stops along the way was like a hundred and forty eight miles an hour, which included, you know All the time it was stopped.

538
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:17,114
Speaker 2: Flying to Florida is like an hour and a half.

539
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:17,900
Speaker 2: ish, right?

540
00:34:18,362 --> 00:34:42,975
Speaker 0: Might be a little much but like you figure Japan is like, California And they used to run this commercial about how you could get anywhere and I believe it might have just been the main island But anywhere in the main island of Honshu in three hours because I remember eats me son Chican and it was like anywhere on the island three hours.

541
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:44,659
Speaker 2: Did you go to the other island?

542
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,266
Speaker 2: No, no You didn't go to the island that had.

543
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:51,313
Speaker 2: I was among a diet with the animals on it.

544
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:53,179
Speaker 0: No, that's actually that's in Okinawa.

545
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,603
Speaker 0: That's like going to Hawaii.

546
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:55,326
Speaker 0: Yeah.

547
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:59,700
Speaker 0: Okay, but like if if I was gonna go to Okinawa, I'd plan a trip.

548
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:02,534
Speaker 1: So that's like going to TiVo and be like, oh you were in New York.

549
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:03,740
Speaker 1: Did you go see Mount Rushmore?

550
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,824
Speaker 0: We're like you were in New York.

551
00:35:05,864 --> 00:35:07,811
Speaker 0: Did you go see Hawaiian Islands?

552
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:09,717
Speaker 0: You know, it's like it's but it's.

553
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:11,504
Speaker 2: it's the same country Right, so you entered.

554
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:13,533
Speaker 0: it's not though the okay.

555
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:20,666
Speaker 0: Well, you don't need to use your passport politically, but culturally and linguistically It's very similar to the u.s.

556
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:34,060
Speaker 0: Is relationship with Hawaiian Islands, you know, it was a distinct culture Which was then taken into the Japanese Country like I forget exactly when it was like a few hundred.

557
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:36,650
Speaker 2: But I figured like a high school can go on a day trip there.

558
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,537
Speaker 2: then so can a terrorist right?

559
00:35:38,697 --> 00:35:39,440
Speaker 2: No, whatever.

560
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:40,840
Speaker 0: They didn't go on a day trip.

561
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,735
Speaker 0: I thought they did go on the school trip kind of like how I went to Hokkaido.

562
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:48,267
Speaker 2: school trip isn't just one day Trip is.

563
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:52,348
Speaker 0: usually you take it's like Might be four days to a week.

564
00:35:52,488 --> 00:35:58,296
Speaker 0: usually, you know, it's it's like an actual vacation so it's.

565
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,969
Speaker 0: But anyway, I'd like to go to Okinawa someday.

566
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:08,968
Speaker 0: I haven't I haven't really explored that far afield but In any case now

567
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:27,143
Speaker 1: one trouble with the rail pass is that most of the subways in the cities are private like New York used to be which really sucks and half the bus is like there's Traps, I'll give you the bus stop Which takes like the normal pass but then like a Private bus that follows the same route will just show up and if you get on it You're fucked and you gotta pay

568
00:36:27,363 --> 00:36:36,557
Speaker 0: there in Kyoto because we bought like it's three dollars to get all you can ride city bus pass For a day in Kyoto and actually most of the cities have that.

569
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:37,280
Speaker 0: like in Nagoya.

570
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:42,960
Speaker 0: We pay seven dollars on the private subway in Nagoya and you can just ride around all you want.

571
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:49,859
Speaker 0: But in Kyoto, we pay the three dollars for the pass and apparently they're a city bus and Kyoto bus.

572
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:54,234
Speaker 0: so if you see it's a city bus and just Kyoto bus.

573
00:36:54,555 --> 00:37:00,296
Speaker 0: and It was like oh no cuz we got on the one going to Gion.

574
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:04,032
Speaker 0: and then I was like Notice the sign that was like you cannot use your pass.

575
00:37:04,073 --> 00:37:07,003
Speaker 0: and then the the conductor Said that.

576
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:11,720
Speaker 0: and the funny thing is there are Japanese tourists who were confused the same way.

577
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:17,464
Speaker 0: So it wasn't just us being dumb Americans like one old lady Day pass.

578
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:19,450
Speaker 0: and he was like no day passes.

579
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:25,173
Speaker 0: This is the private bus and it was like dang it Why you know is a bit frustrated.

580
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:25,555
Speaker 1: Yes.

581
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,563
Speaker 2: It's yeah Subway.

582
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:30,420
Speaker 2: you would get trademarked in the US for doing that, right?

583
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,109
Speaker 2: It's like that's.

584
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,619
Speaker 2: it's like weird.

585
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:38,500
Speaker 2: We have like these laws and that's the kind of thing they're meant to stop and we're like But we get mad when the laws are too strong, but in other places, they don't have the laws.

586
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,713
Speaker 1: You're like, oh, yeah, we were solving a problem though Cabs in New York or in Japan at least in Tokyo.

587
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:46,420
Speaker 2: We're really funny how much money they cut.

588
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,119
Speaker 1: They were actually really cheap and you're not allowed to tip them like you don't tip.

589
00:37:50,242 --> 00:37:51,305
Speaker 1: Well, like why would like?

590
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:51,686
Speaker 1: it's crazy.

591
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:52,850
Speaker 1: It's like it's weird if you tip them.

592
00:37:54,114 --> 00:37:59,374
Speaker 0: I I know that in most Japan Businesses like restaurants you never tip which is great.

593
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:02,593
Speaker 2: I'm so like Was it was their sales tags?

594
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:03,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was fine.

595
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:04,642
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

596
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:19,453
Speaker 1: sales tax is 5% on everything not on everything and prices on everything are in multiples of five or ten And as a result you pretty much almost never get like 1 yen coins or any crap like that Like they round things to reasonable amounts.

597
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:22,956
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm Any like electronic stores or anything?

598
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:27,018
Speaker 0: We went to Big camera we went to big camera.

599
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:27,300
Speaker 1: we did.

600
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:32,162
Speaker 2: They have all kinds of stuff that you can't get here Really?

601
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:36,444
Speaker 2: I mean, I thought they have like all kinds of small things that you can't buy here like laptops We can't get.

602
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:39,078
Speaker 1: the boutique laptop market is really kind of dried up.

603
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:44,560
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I mean you you could see the cell phones like the fancy Japanese cell phone.

604
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,273
Speaker 2: But I mean are they really or anything better than like our smartphones now?

605
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:48,660
Speaker 2: I think we've caught up pretty much.

606
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:50,066
Speaker 0: I mean the smartphone thing.

607
00:38:50,106 --> 00:38:53,000
Speaker 2: it's interesting because I mean except you can watch TV on their phones.

608
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:57,246
Speaker 0: Well, the traditional Japanese cell phone are still very popular.

609
00:38:57,306 --> 00:39:05,147
Speaker 0: but smartphones like iPhone is super big like it's a very very coveted Cellphone, why don't everything just go get one?

610
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:05,649
Speaker 2: It's not that much.

611
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:08,540
Speaker 0: a lot of people do, you know a lot of but it's very expensive.

612
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:11,372
Speaker 2: So a lot of people everything did it cost more than it cost here?

613
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:11,613
Speaker 2: Yes.

614
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:12,075
Speaker 2: Yes.

615
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:13,340
Speaker 2: How much is an iPhone in Japan?

616
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:15,064
Speaker 1: There's the trouble to.

617
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:18,820
Speaker 1: the exchange rate was pretty much as far against us as it could have possibly been.

618
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:25,345
Speaker 0: I used to remember when it was like one penny to one yen about like one night in Kyoto because you know No one takes credit cards really.

619
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:30,847
Speaker 1: so we were kind of low on money like we had like 7,000 yen left Which is you know, that's like 70 bucks.

620
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:33,516
Speaker 1: give or take little eat less because the exchange rate.

621
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:45,186
Speaker 1: but we were in Gion The river so basically every place was too fancy and we could not afford to eat $700 with $70.

622
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:47,316
Speaker 2: two people can't eat for seven.

623
00:39:47,457 --> 00:39:48,080
Speaker 1: where we were.

624
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:49,723
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

625
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:51,368
Speaker 0: It was like the Park Avenue.

626
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:52,572
Speaker 0: It was the fancy place.

627
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,820
Speaker 0: We're all like you go to the fancy.

628
00:39:55,023 --> 00:40:00,640
Speaker 1: You couldn't go to be Walked way back to our real count and there was a little cheaper place.

629
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:07,651
Speaker 0: We didn't eat combini bento very much or anything like.

630
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:11,542
Speaker 1: I basically ate my way across Japan eating the best goddamn food That was.

631
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:14,737
Speaker 0: that was mostly thanks to our family.

Speaker 2: that to each other.

648
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:21,120
Speaker 0: When when I was living there Kaori nay-san was still a single and living at home, but she recently got married and she has two kids.

649
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:22,565

650
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:23,448
Speaker 1: But mr.

00:41:23,508 --> 00:41:26,940
Speaker 1: Noted that they took us out to his like his favorite sushi place.

652
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:28,900
Speaker 1: That was the best sushi I've ever had in my life.

653
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:36,009
Speaker 2: I've never had anything because where the fish are if you let the fish are you would taste good and of course Oh, it was all super good.

654
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:36,652
Speaker 2: Unless you're him.

655
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:37,937
Speaker 2: You want to eat some East River sushi?

00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:38,700
Speaker 2: I'll cook it up for you.

657
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:43,676
Speaker 0: We had raw shrimp raw shrimp in the u.s.

658
00:41:43,776 --> 00:41:44,860
Speaker 0: I would be too scared.

659
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,708
Speaker 2: Where would you even get a raw shrimp in the u.s.

660
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:48,034
Speaker 0: That that was maybe.

661
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:52,940
Speaker 0: maybe they're like, Louisiana You can get some yeah, but I'd to be too worried about parasites.

662
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:57,386
Speaker 2: I'm not gonna eat it A few years ago.

663
00:41:57,406 --> 00:42:02,328
Speaker 1: raw shrimp is a food Entirely distinct from cooked shrimp.

664
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:09,500
Speaker 1: It is that what I ate that day Is probably between the shellfish and the shrimp the most delicious.

665
00:42:09,782 --> 00:42:12,680
Speaker 2: Are you sure they weren't cheating where they perhaps injecting it secretly?

666
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,160
Speaker 2: So you think it was raw but really it was just butter shaped like shrimp.

667
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:26,800
Speaker 2: Did they feed the Shrimps that were like that were living in a tank or they would dump sugar in the tank for the shrimps to eat?

668
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,623
Speaker 0: That's silly.

669
00:42:27,764 --> 00:42:29,129
Speaker 2: No, so that would work.

670
00:42:29,371 --> 00:42:31,600
Speaker 1: It was weird though cuz it was like gray and I was uncooked.

671
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:32,482
Speaker 1: It was those.

672
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:35,491

00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:35,591
Speaker 1: Yeah,

674
00:42:36,293 --> 00:42:37,016

690
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:34,823
Speaker 1: I felt like my body might be at a limit where if I push it any further something my bed might Happen.

691
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:36,699
Speaker 0: I I was temperate.

707
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:09,869

708
00:45:10,594 --> 00:45:12,242
Speaker 1: that was a Teva I learned.

709
00:45:12,283 --> 00:45:17,960
Speaker 1: I learned what Teva meant from KO century beasts because that was what that was the birds name.

710
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:19,139
Speaker 2: And you have seen a big robot.

00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:02,831
Speaker 1: It was like amusement park, but basically it was sets.

727
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,640
Speaker 2: Did they have all Japanese movies?

728
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,269
Speaker 2: Did they have the Power Rangers show with the music?

729
00:46:06,671 --> 00:46:06,852
Speaker 1: Yeah.

730
00:46:06,913 --> 00:46:07,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, they did.

731
00:46:07,738 --> 00:46:10,415
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it was so like all the stuff you'd expect

732
00:46:10,436 --> 00:46:11,039
Speaker 2: you crowd her it

733
00:46:13,423 --> 00:46:15,758
Speaker 0: Extra to get into the Power Rangers stuff in the haunted

734
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:16,000
Speaker 1: house.

735
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:22,160
Speaker 1: The best part was the sets like you've now if I watch old like Japanese samurai movies like these sets were all used.

736
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:24,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, only Kyoto Studios.

737
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:30,610
Speaker 1: It was like toy, but they made a lot of movies Like there's this one bridge and there's all this.

738
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:33,120
Speaker 1: like the text was like this bridge is in every goddamn movie.

739
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:35,580
Speaker 2: Yeah, we only built one bridge because it's hard to make bridge.

740
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:48,040
Speaker 1: Basically, the sign was like we changed the signs and like a little bit of the landscaping around it and it's a different bridge and we And they always set the scene by changing the name of the town on the sign on the bridge.

741
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:48,558
Speaker 0: Yeah

742
00:46:49,202 --> 00:47:02,719
Speaker 1: But the best part of all of that was there was a building that had these sets for ninjas and all it was Was it was a part that looked like the rafters above a room and then right under that was the part that looked like the rafters Under the floor in a room.

743
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:14,100
Speaker 0: so you'd anytime they had to shoot a scene of a ninja like being above the eaves and listening in or being below the Listening and they just had that one room in the building that they'd they'd shoot.

744
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there were.

745
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:19,700
Speaker 0: there were a bunch of things from different period dramas and did I get key?

746
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:20,883
Speaker 0: And so that was.

747
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:21,988
Speaker 0: that was really cool.

748
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:24,700
Speaker 1: There's a really cool exhibit in like the museum part of it, too.

749
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:30,219
Speaker 1: It was like famous Japanese directors and a collection of their personal effects that were kind of like relevant to there.

750
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:38,587
Speaker 1: I love that cuz actually even though I'm like a pair of binoculars and a teacup and a canteen and Beret or whatever.

751
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:39,914
Speaker 0: No, I'm like really into film.

752
00:47:40,015 --> 00:47:41,685
Speaker 2: It's probably just all Japanese film directors.

753
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,610
Speaker 0: there were a lot of.

754
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:47,635
Speaker 2: Here's everyone's beret.

755
00:47:48,703 --> 00:47:49,788
Speaker 2: Here's their backup beret.

756
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:57,896
Speaker 0: It was cool cuz it was like from the 19 Like 1920s and stuff onwards a pre-war really early stuff.

757
00:47:58,037 --> 00:47:58,237
Speaker 0: It was.

758
00:47:58,398 --> 00:47:59,080
Speaker 0: it was pretty neat.

759
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:02,791
Speaker 0: But speaking of museums, how do you like the Ghibli Museum?

760
00:48:02,991 --> 00:48:13,815
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Ghibli Museum is like wickedly awesome People like fight to get tickets or whatever, you know, it was way crowded You know, basically it's like it looks like Ghibli movies like the whole thing like.

761
00:48:13,835 --> 00:48:24,176
Speaker 1: there's there's the the Lop to Robot like on the roof kind of looking at a garden like a wildly growing garden on the roof And there's all these weird little like like hidey holes like you'd like.

762
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,060
Speaker 1: there's like you're walking.

763
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:26,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could.

764
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:30,700
Speaker 1: we did even though you even though you're big like you go in and there's a little spiral staircase.

765
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,624
Speaker 1: It's like really tiny.

766
00:48:31,644 --> 00:48:32,648
Speaker 1: you like squeeze into it.

767
00:48:32,668 --> 00:48:34,898
Speaker 1: It goes up like three stars, but it's meant for Japanese people.

768
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:37,580
Speaker 0: Yeah It's meant for kids.

769
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:37,922
Speaker 0: It's the.

770
00:48:38,022 --> 00:48:39,891
Speaker 0: how do you fit out for kids?

771
00:48:39,991 --> 00:48:46,504
Speaker 1: because we crouched in and just kind of Witched our way up and then we got to a little tunnel and it took us across and then we're like up in another part of the museum.

772
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:52,788
Speaker 0: it's it's like a museum where Actually being in the building itself is fun.

773
00:48:53,350 --> 00:49:12,005
Speaker 0: Like if you were a little kid, it's a very adventureful building You know, you're like popping out of doorways and being like, oh there there it is And just going around through like you have to crouch down to get into some doorways and it's it's really neat It's very Very good design.

774
00:49:12,045 --> 00:49:14,595
Speaker 2: They also show the fire marshal probably wouldn't let it exist.

775
00:49:14,696 --> 00:49:20,619
Speaker 1: Oh, so I'll say this You any US fire marshal if you ever go to Japan, you will have a heart attack.

776
00:49:21,362 --> 00:49:31,180
Speaker 1: Like we were on a bus right a bus to go back from the fancy restaurant and the bus had little things on the seats Like there was a aisle up the middle and sets of two seats on either side like a normal bus to take people somewhere.

777
00:49:32,162 --> 00:49:34,880
Speaker 1: And there was these things like and I couldn't figure out what they are and I look at them.

778
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,786
Speaker 1: I realize they were pads.

779
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:43,159
Speaker 1: you could flip them up and put them across the aisle to make a fifth seat blocking the aisle All the way up the bus.

780
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:47,893
Speaker 1: Yeah And there's stuff like that everywhere in Japan like they did and I feel like.

781
00:49:48,275 --> 00:49:53,872
Speaker 1: it's probably not any more Dangerous to be like that in Japan because I it's people are tiny.

782
00:49:54,173 --> 00:50:02,480
Speaker 1: No because people seem more Polite and I feel like if there was an announcement like you evacuate the theater people would just walk out calmly.

783
00:50:02,742 --> 00:50:05,020
Speaker 0: People are in general pretty good about that.

784
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,272
Speaker 0: I mean you look at the footage from after the earthquake and people.

785
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:20,400
Speaker 0: I think it's like they have a good sense of Other people of society and so they're like paying attention and not causing trouble or budging in line or anything like that.

786
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,506
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

787
00:50:21,546 --> 00:50:22,752
Speaker 0: This is what we have to do.

788
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:24,240
Speaker 0: We'll be very orderly about it.

789
00:50:24,865 --> 00:50:25,349
Speaker 1: There's a fire.

790
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:36,524
Speaker 0: everybody's gonna be George Costanza yeah, but Anyway, we got to see like one of the short films that they that they run only in the museum There was one about.

791
00:50:36,665 --> 00:50:38,312
Speaker 0: it was about catching a whale.

792
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,899
Speaker 1: the whale was totally troll.

793
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:49,370
Speaker 2: face the whales like Like had a big eyeball and was sort of like yeah, if he'd roll it up like yeah Yeah, I know the style.

794
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,100
Speaker 2: I know they've done that in a lot of Ghibli movies.

795
00:50:51,991 --> 00:50:52,972
Speaker 0: Do the eyeball roll.

796
00:50:53,113 --> 00:50:54,174
Speaker 0: it was it was.

797
00:50:54,195 --> 00:51:02,580
Speaker 1: oh so that the one of the neatest things in the museum Is that this like room of animation and they're like zoetrops and all the different like old anime?

798
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,469
Speaker 1: They had a 3d zoetrope with models And then a stroke so it's spinning.

799
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:09,071
Speaker 1: you're like what's this?

800
00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:13,880
Speaker 1: and the strobe light comes on and it's a three-dimensional Like stop-motion animation just happening in front of you.

801
00:51:13,965 --> 00:51:22,394
Speaker 0: Yeah it looks like a ton of dolls just dancing and it's got like little Totoro's jumping up and down and Jumping rope and stuff like that.

802
00:51:22,575 --> 00:51:23,460
Speaker 0: Oh, it's so cool.

803
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:28,780
Speaker 0: But actually my favorite room was the how animation is made room whether you already know there.

804
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,050
Speaker 0: No, but it's like a fictional animation studio.

805
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:33,173
Speaker 1: It was to a dream.

806
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:35,640
Speaker 1: It was to animation what the matrix is to hacking.

807
00:51:36,061 --> 00:51:36,463
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.

808
00:51:36,523 --> 00:51:36,804
Speaker 0: Yeah.

809
00:51:36,824 --> 00:51:37,707
Speaker 0: Well, it was.

810
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:45,715
Speaker 0: it was very sweet and old-fashioned from a bygone era Big wooden desks and stuff like that like on the desk.

811
00:51:45,775 --> 00:51:47,100
Speaker 1: It shows like an animator station.

812
00:51:47,120 --> 00:52:00,763
Speaker 1: There's like paper everywhere and likes drawings and drawings and notes and notes and reference models and books strewn everywhere And then a pot full of an infinite number of cigarette butts And a lot of the signs were were more Truthful, it wasn't like.

813
00:52:00,903 --> 00:52:03,671
Speaker 0: animation is perfect and wonderful job forever.

814
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:15,179
Speaker 0: One of them in English said something like this is really tedious yeah, and I I just really liked reading about it and you know, I could have spent a lot more time in there But it was pretty crowded.

815
00:52:16,805 --> 00:52:26,597
Speaker 0: Tezuka Museum We didn't get time Actually, it was like also the International Manga Museum in Kyoto, which we which we also missed out on.

816
00:52:26,697 --> 00:52:34,127
Speaker 2: but it was like You can't even come to New York and see all the museum City not a whole country.

817
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:36,436
Speaker 1: we went to multiple major cities and we were in Nagoya.

818
00:52:36,456 --> 00:52:38,546
Speaker 1: we went to the university We out there.

819
00:52:38,626 --> 00:52:40,274
Speaker 1: I wanted to see some jazz, you know where we went.

820
00:52:40,876 --> 00:52:47,580
Speaker 1: blue note The blue note has a sister blue note the only other one in Nagoya because Nagoya is a huge jazz scene.

821
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:52,297
Speaker 2: Like imagine if New York Chicago and LA were in the same state.

822
00:52:52,578 --> 00:53:00,440
Speaker 1: Yeah but the thing is in New York a lot of the jazz musicians that play around here are from Nagoya come from Nagoya.

823
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:06,745
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought that was really cool and they have kind of almost like a musician exchange You know with the blue notes.

824
00:53:06,845 --> 00:53:10,437
Speaker 1: and the coolest thing was there was no smoking in the blue note.

825
00:53:10,477 --> 00:53:10,818
Speaker 1: Yeah.

826
00:53:10,878 --> 00:53:11,480
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

827
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,906
Speaker 0: But I went.

828
00:53:13,247 --> 00:53:15,960
Speaker 0: I actually cuz rim was like he really wanted to see a show.

829
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:19,180
Speaker 0: And so at first we were like, maybe we can go see Takarazuka.

830
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,044
Speaker 0: I can't see that and it was like totally sold out and it was really to try to do.

831
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:28,840
Speaker 0: But when we went to Nagoya rim was like, how about some jazz club?

832
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,144
Speaker 0: And and so I went.

833
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:34,676
Speaker 0: we were at oasis 21 this big park in the in the city.

834
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:35,739
Speaker 0: It's amazing all.

835
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:45,187
Speaker 0: and I went to the JTB office in the mall and I was like, I'm uh, I'm here, you know on Recommendations of the US branch of JTB.

836
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:53,189
Speaker 0: I was wondering if you could give me any information about jazz clubs in In Nagoya and the lady was super helpful.

837
00:53:53,209 --> 00:53:56,159
Speaker 0: She was like, oh, yeah, the blue note is just a few blocks.

838
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:57,023
Speaker 0: that way I'm like, huh?

839
00:53:57,103 --> 00:54:08,508
Speaker 0: That's funny because the blue notes the one we go to in New York and So that actually that was a really good performance and it was kind of laid-back which was nice You know, it was at least for me.

840
00:54:08,609 --> 00:54:10,274
Speaker 0: The trip was kind of intense.

841
00:54:10,736 --> 00:54:19,300
Speaker 0: Like I'm so used to To living in Japan where I do cool stuff, but it was like spread out and most of it was just like routine daily life.

842
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:25,354
Speaker 1: I was filled with Illimitable indomitable energy, but I think it was partly because you didn't have to do anything or talk.

843
00:54:25,414 --> 00:54:28,884
Speaker 1: There's also nothing to drink Except tea.

844
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:29,967
Speaker 0: That's true.

845
00:54:30,168 --> 00:54:33,898
Speaker 2: So I was didn't get like all the weird things like coffee to hit.

846
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:34,540
Speaker 2: can they heat this?

847
00:54:34,721 --> 00:54:36,339
Speaker 1: I did I got all that stuff.

848
00:54:36,862 --> 00:54:40,756
Speaker 1: But I basically was drinking caffeinated beverages all the time constantly while I was awake.

849
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:41,760
Speaker 0: and then you drink booze.

850
00:54:45,147 --> 00:54:49,211
Speaker 1: They don't have just like water Like if you go to a restaurant, but usually they don't.

851
00:54:49,272 --> 00:54:54,579
Speaker 1: they don't just water they give you tea And as far as I can tell pretty much everyone just orders a beer.

852
00:54:55,403 --> 00:54:56,769
Speaker 1: Like beer is cuz.

853
00:54:56,809 --> 00:55:02,131
Speaker 0: we ate a lot of the times when we were by ourselves We'd eat at like Izakaya, which is like the neighborhood pub.

854
00:55:02,292 --> 00:55:04,580
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, no, you're gonna get beer there.

855
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,262
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

856
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:07,991
Speaker 0: it's very also like a notice like like in a place.

857
00:55:08,051 --> 00:55:15,920
Speaker 1: beer with dinner is just kind of a much more Typical thing and I really really understand now why Japan seems so big on very light beers.

858
00:55:16,202 --> 00:55:23,272
Speaker 1: yeah Guinness doesn't go well with Japanese food, but Like a Karen or something really goes well with like a kitsune.

859
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:27,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not drinking, you know, the manly beer I had to keep stay with on Scott.

860
00:55:27,668 --> 00:55:29,396
Speaker 1: Let me tell you they're pretty good.

861
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:31,751
Speaker 1: Yeah They were pretty damn good.

862
00:55:31,933 --> 00:55:36,690
Speaker 0: I haven't had one in a while But anyway, let's see what other cool stuff we did.

863
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:46,671
Speaker 0: we do I don't we don't want to go on too long or anything but So well, we went to onsen And we saw Mount Fuji from the show.

864
00:55:46,712 --> 00:55:47,414
Speaker 2: how hot was it?

865
00:55:47,475 --> 00:55:48,880
Speaker 2: was it like it was normal?

866
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:49,964
Speaker 0: We didn't go in.

867
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:51,689
Speaker 2: the was hotter than the bathroom.

868
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:56,729
Speaker 0: It wasn't a Rotenborough with an actual natural No, the water was hot spring, you know.

869
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,420
Speaker 0: So they pumped up the water from an underground aquifer and I'm assuming probably mixed it with tap water.

870
00:56:05,063 --> 00:56:08,940
Speaker 0: But you could tell it was hot spring water because of all the mineral deposits.

871
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,200
Speaker 1: And I actually have pictures from the cable car through the mountains the volcano.

872
00:56:16,622 --> 00:56:19,500
Speaker 0: We went on a ropeway over a volcano while we were there too.

873
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,740
Speaker 1: We went on there's like this touristy pirate boat that takes you through the lake in Hakone like our pirates.

874
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:30,080
Speaker 1: But it's silly like there's a silly statue of Nelson and there's a pirate statue on it.

875
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:36,780
Speaker 0: He's like he's pointing a pistol and everybody else points like poses like he's shooting them or something like that.

876
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:46,710
Speaker 1: But the funny thing is we're standing up in like the crow's nest area like the like the little like observation deck thing they had for people to stand on and the pirates like hanging off the ledge up There and his butt's just there.

877
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,978
Speaker 1: I didn't really think much of it.

878
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:58,408
Speaker 1: Every little kid who walked up there Walked up looked at the butt went straight for it and like shoved a sword into it poked at it Put their face on it.

879
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:03,640
Speaker 1: I got a really good picture of it.

880
00:57:09,122 --> 00:57:16,549
Speaker 2: It's easy for people to be child brothers you show them but It's easy to become a comedian.

881
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:18,099
Speaker 1: just show someone a. but that's right.

882
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:19,996
Speaker 1: The adults weren't like stop it.

883
00:57:20,016 --> 00:57:27,337
Speaker 0: they were like The kids just like they were so single-minded about it as soon as they saw the pirate.

884
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:28,743
Speaker 0: it wasn't like hey It's a pirate.

885
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:30,171
Speaker 0: and then they were like looking at the pirate.

886
00:57:30,191 --> 00:57:34,905
Speaker 0: It was just like hey, it's a. but So we.

887
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:37,980
Speaker 0: so we did all the the Hakone sightseeing stuff.

888
00:57:38,100 --> 00:58:00,879
Speaker 0: but yeah onsen was really really nice and apparently in the new Eva movies, there's like Scenes in Hakone or something because in the in the New type magazine there was this whole thing about like oh This part of Hakone was in this scene and stuff like that and they also were selling as souvenirs Kaji's watermelon Manju.

889
00:58:03,124 --> 00:58:05,220
Speaker 0: That was pretty cute, so I thought that was funny.

890
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:14,449
Speaker 0: but there was also like a little Prince Museum like the book for the book club and So That was kind of odd.

891
00:58:14,631 --> 00:58:15,598
Speaker 0: It was like going it.

892
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,614
Speaker 0: No, we wanted to but it we ran out of time, and it was like.

893
00:58:20,276 --> 00:58:23,577
Speaker 0: I said in Hakone That's like such a random place to have a be.

894
00:58:23,597 --> 00:58:24,020
Speaker 2: there's a reason.

895
00:58:25,162 --> 00:58:26,409
Speaker 2: Looking up on the googles.

896
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:26,972
Speaker 1: I looked around.

897
00:58:26,992 --> 00:58:31,148
Speaker 1: I couldn't really find any like Explanation, but anyway, so that was nice.

898
00:58:31,169 --> 00:58:34,040
Speaker 2: We relax the museum of the little prince in Hakone.

899
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:39,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, we relaxed in the bath, and it was really nice and it's in English now in Nagoya.

00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:54,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like I was kind of why See because to see you know and we were in Akihabara And I was like maybe we should go to a maid cafe, or maybe this was Emily's idea.

01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:50,933
Speaker 2: in the back is probably some chef.

01:00:50,973 --> 01:00:52,220
Speaker 2: He's like the grumpiest guy.

934
01:00:53,081 --> 01:01:00,900

Speaker 2: many?

941
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,100
Speaker 1: Tension among them like fighting over customers.

942
01:01:20,261 --> 01:01:22,208
Speaker 1: It's fucked up and this place had a like.

943
01:01:22,228 --> 01:01:22,991
Speaker 1: you could get a like.

944
01:01:23,011 --> 01:01:25,179
Speaker 1: you could level up if you go there often enough.

945
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,495
Speaker 1: you Have to go there like a hundred times to level up.

946
01:01:28,535 --> 01:01:29,540
Speaker 2: What do you get if you level up?

947
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:31,986
Speaker 1: I don't even know or made attention.

948
01:01:32,046 --> 01:01:36,100
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know but it's it's not creepy or anything.

949
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,069
Speaker 0: It's just like a restaurant like a theme restaurant.

950
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:47,880
Speaker 0: It's just like the ninja restaurant, but it's it's a restaurant of like Super energetic kawaii like talking in a fake cute way.

951
01:01:48,322 --> 01:01:51,536
Speaker 2: But I just really want to know what those maids think when like they're not at work.

952
01:01:51,597 --> 01:01:52,240
Speaker 2: Are they you know?

953
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,367
Speaker 1: You know, so what do you think later?

954
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:54,870
Speaker 1: Not at work?

955
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:59,699
Speaker 2: I knew a girl work on the same personality At anime club, right?

956
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:08,160
Speaker 0: There was a girl who worked in a cosplay cafe Which is very similar except that instead of acting like a uber cute maid you act like the character you cosplay.

957
01:02:09,221 --> 01:02:13,560
Speaker 0: So she would come and she'd be like, oh my god, there are some really stupid customers.

958
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:19,017
Speaker 0: But then she she genuinely liked her job because she was into anime and she liked cosplaying and stuff like that.

959
01:02:19,137 --> 01:02:26,819
Speaker 0: So I mean It probably comes with some annoyingness, but it also comes with hey, this is kind of fun, you know.

960
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:29,500
Speaker 0: So guess what our maids name was?

961
01:02:31,386 --> 01:02:32,860
Speaker 2: I don't know them time.

962
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,259
Speaker 2: Okay, is that a coincidence?

963
01:02:36,202 --> 01:02:40,420
Speaker 0: Her name was doom and like we came in I said they'd write your name on the little thing.

964
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,264
Speaker 0: They say what's your name?

965
01:02:41,305 --> 01:02:50,785
Speaker 0: And I'm like Emily and this is rim and they're like She was cute too and they call her over and she's like Yeah, so it's fun.

966
01:02:51,326 --> 01:02:54,194
Speaker 0: But my favorite was my cafe.

967
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:56,440
Speaker 1: So in Nagoya we went to a cafe.

968
01:02:56,661 --> 01:02:57,524
Speaker 0: We went to a cafe.

969
01:02:57,664 --> 01:03:00,976
Speaker 0: That's my my instead of no host cafes for me things.

970
01:03:01,438 --> 01:03:02,205
Speaker 1: I want a Cafe.

971
01:03:03,882 --> 01:03:11,531
Speaker 1: It was basically you get food and there's a whole bunch of really cute really Like affectionate bunnies and you just hang out with the bunnies.

972
01:03:11,591 --> 01:03:12,233
Speaker 1: Yeah and pet.

973
01:03:12,254 --> 01:03:15,860
Speaker 2: the food area was separate But you don't want bunny hair and all the food.

974
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:21,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, you go into this little back playroom and there are like five or six bunnies out running around.

975
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:24,015
Speaker 0: they have like 20 So it's not like bunnies everywhere.

976
01:03:24,035 --> 01:03:28,987
Speaker 0: Well, there's 2025 I think Regular bunnies or maybe more like what.

977
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:32,540
Speaker 0: they rotate him, but they rotate him because they can't all be out at the same time.

978
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,479
Speaker 0: So they give them rests and stuff like that.

979
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:39,856
Speaker 1: So they're the most like people love and rabbits like pump who's like the boss.

980
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:43,950
Speaker 1: rather as far as I can tell Run over and be like hello.

981
01:03:43,971 --> 01:03:44,614
Speaker 1: pet me over here.

982
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:49,700
Speaker 0: now He'd like jump on rims lap and like flop out next to him.

983
01:03:49,841 --> 01:03:52,900
Speaker 1: I'm jumping behind me and like trying to like grab my shirt and steal it.

984
01:03:53,522 --> 01:03:57,077
Speaker 0: He'd pull stuff out of rims pockets and run away with it and he was.

985
01:03:57,217 --> 01:03:57,900
Speaker 0: he was just very.

986
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:08,718
Speaker 0: He did little binky dances and stuff like that and he was super soft too because he was a Rex rabbit which have no Guard hairs, so he felt like velvet.

987
01:04:09,121 --> 01:04:14,540
Speaker 0: It was like this little velvet rabbit who is just like so rambunctious and adorable.

988
01:04:15,361 --> 01:04:20,020
Speaker 2: So it was actually probably, you know, if you're making a restaurant you're going out and you're picking the cutest rabbit.

989
01:04:20,642 --> 01:04:21,184
Speaker 0: But they did.

01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:43,400
Speaker 1: but so there's a petting zoo in the Japanese.

1009
01:05:43,681 --> 01:05:49,499
Speaker 1: Oh, that was you know what the petting zoo is a trough filled with guinea pigs that kids just like run in and grab them.

1010
01:05:54,561 --> 01:06:05,300
Speaker 0: So bad for those poor guinea pigs, but I mean the staff were there and they were kind of supervising But like the kids were so high energy and they did not know how to handle the guinea pigs.

1011
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,537
Speaker 0: It was just like all piggies poor guys, you know, luckily guinea pigs.

1012
01:06:09,557 --> 01:06:12,025
Speaker 2: They're probably like Pee on this kid watch.

1013
01:06:12,105 --> 01:06:14,492
Speaker 0: they're pretty hardy, you know, luckily they're.

1014
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,980
Speaker 0: they're a little bit more sturdy than rabbits.

1015
01:06:17,121 --> 01:06:19,218
Speaker 2: I think like imagine imagine if we were in.

1016
01:06:19,861 --> 01:06:25,361
Speaker 2: We were in a big pen and it was the Giants petting zoo and the giant kids would come and play with us like that You would.

1017
01:06:25,703 --> 01:06:30,060
Speaker 2: I just be like hey rim and rim would be like getting like swung around by some kid.

1018
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:32,239
Speaker 2: I'd like watch this like barf on him.

1019
01:06:36,142 --> 01:06:38,799
Speaker 2: Anyway, I didn't run away crying cuz he a little barf on him.

1020
01:06:40,822 --> 01:06:43,109
Speaker 0: So is there anything that stood out in your mind?

1021
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:45,797
Speaker 0: like the food is so good?

1022
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:51,475
Speaker 1: Though the weird things that stood out were that nobody nobody.

1023
01:06:51,576 --> 01:06:58,256
Speaker 1: until we got to Kyoto I did not see a single person other than Gaijin wearing sunglasses.

1024
01:06:58,276 --> 01:06:58,837
Speaker 2: It's sunny.

1025
01:06:59,158 --> 01:07:02,603
Speaker 1: It was Stupidly Ludicrously sunny and hot.

1026
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,971
Speaker 1: it was basically unseasonably warm summer over there.

1027
01:07:05,051 --> 01:07:05,794
Speaker 2: You couldn't even see yeah.

1028
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:07,078
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, it snowed here.

1029
01:07:08,501 --> 01:07:10,956
Speaker 1: It's not once yeah, but no it was like so sunny.

1030
01:07:10,976 --> 01:07:11,540
Speaker 1: It was painful.

1031
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,300
Speaker 1: Nobody had sunglasses on not a single goddamn person.

1032
01:07:15,843 --> 01:07:18,500
Speaker 1: I can't figure out if there's a thing about sunglasses or what?

1033
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,357
Speaker 1: Well, you're being the Yakuza if you have sunglasses, but then we got to Kyoto and people there were wearing sunglasses.

1034
01:07:23,397 --> 01:07:24,039
Speaker 1: Just nowhere else.

1035
01:07:24,925 --> 01:07:26,558
Speaker 2: people in Kyoto are the only smart people I guess.

1036
01:07:26,578 --> 01:07:31,671
Speaker 1: and For society where they were all Yakuza for society where no one takes credit cards.

1037
01:07:32,093 --> 01:07:34,520
Speaker 1: It amazes me how few ATMs there are.

1038
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:39,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's basically almost no way to get money if you need money like right now.

1039
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,990
Speaker 1: So you can pretty much assume that anyone walking around And it was like going out to dinner or something or like.

1040
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:48,520
Speaker 1: if someone's gonna go buy an iPad they've got cash Tons of it in their pocket.

1056
01:08:22,241 --> 01:08:32,658
Speaker 0: actually, that's not quite true because I do remember being in high school and going to a girl's school and I Was one of the tallest in my grade like I was used to being average.

1057
01:08:33,862 --> 01:08:37,300

01:08:50,435 --> 01:08:51,040
Speaker 2: That's what I'm saying.

1064
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:51,805

01:13:42,137 --> 01:13:42,579
Speaker 1: you'll be happy.

1158
01:13:42,599 --> 01:13:43,363
Speaker 1: We saw a lot of.

1159
01:13:43,705 --> 01:13:44,590
Speaker 1: you know, the old shit.

1160
01:13:47,276 --> 01:13:55,856
Speaker 0: But actually My thing is I was kind of freaking out like I had a really really good time and it was so good to be back In Japan, it'd been like over five years.

1161
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:57,220
Speaker 0: So I was really starting.

1162
01:13:57,581 --> 01:14:00,470
Speaker 0: I really missed my my Japanese family.

1163
01:14:00,711 --> 01:14:03,420
Speaker 0: So it was really cool to see basically really cool people.

1164
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,085
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's I think of them.

1165
01:14:05,406 --> 01:14:06,550
Speaker 0: They're like my relations.

1166
01:14:06,832 --> 01:14:25,370
Speaker 0: I consider them part of my family and so I was good to see them, but it was also just good to be back and My whole thing was I was a little stressed out because I was like How do I convey to rim what it's like to be in a place and show him all these different facets of this country?

1167
01:14:25,472 --> 01:14:26,287
Speaker 0: I love so much.

1168
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:31,290
Speaker 0: But actually I think for a couple of weeks we did a pretty good job.

1169
01:14:31,391 --> 01:14:38,265
Speaker 0: We saw a lot of traditional stuff but we also saw a lot of modern stuff and we went nerdy stuff and we went normal stuff.

1170
01:14:38,385 --> 01:14:42,723
Speaker 2: and you know it What's in the regular movie theater?

1171
01:14:43,306 --> 01:14:44,210
Speaker 0: Oh, what's going on now?

1172
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:47,399
Speaker 0: There was one about like my husband is depressed.

1173
01:14:47,559 --> 01:14:49,945
Speaker 0: There was one about one about a police dog.

1174
01:14:50,006 --> 01:14:54,490
Speaker 0: It was like, you know the Canine officer saying I'm based at shakedown.

1175
01:14:54,570 --> 01:15:00,450
Speaker 0: I'm see that but I kind of want to see it too because if it's got like canine units in it I'm like I was in book off the other day.

1176
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:01,215
Speaker 2: They have all the base.

1177
01:15:01,255 --> 01:15:03,709
Speaker 2: I'd shake down DVDs, but I don't think they have English on them.

1178
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:11,481
Speaker 0: Ah, you could always look and see even had like the TV boxes like all the deeply DVDs have English subtitles But they had everything.

1179
01:15:11,785 --> 01:15:12,250
Speaker 0: that's cool.

1180
01:15:13,251 --> 01:15:16,103
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was pretty good and I didn't even make rim.

1181
01:15:16,143 --> 01:15:17,650
Speaker 0: go into too many bookstores.

1182
01:15:20,839 --> 01:15:21,649

1183
01:15:23,873 --> 01:15:25,441
Speaker 2: Is there Japanese bookstore any different?
